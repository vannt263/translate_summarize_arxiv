    "the latter theory admits a lifshitz scale - invariance in time and space , exhibiting a broken lorentz symmetry at short scales , while at large distances higher derivative terms do not contribute , and the theory reduces to standard general relativity ( gr ) . since then various properties and characteristics of the hoava gravities have been extensively analyzed , ranging from formal developments @xcite",
    ", cosmology @xcite , dark energy @xcite and dark matter @xcite , and spherically symmetric solutions @xcite .",
    "although a generic vacuum of the theory is anti - de sitter one , particular limits of the theory allow for the minkowski vacuum . in this limit the leading order",
    "the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) coefficients coincide with those of the pure gr .",
    "thus , the deviations from the conventional gr can be tested only beyond the post - newtonian corrections , that is for a system with strong gravity at astrophysical scales .",
    "there are basically four versions of hoava gravity , namely , those with or without the `` detailed balance condition '' , and with or without the `` projectability condition '' .",
    "the `` detailed balance condition '' restricts the form of the potential in the 4dim lorentzian action to a specific form in terms of a 3dim euclidean theory . in a cosmological context",
    ", this condition leads to obstacles , and thus must be abandoned . in this context , the ` soft ' violation of the ` detailed balance ' condition modifies the ir behavior .",
    "this ir modification , with an arbitrary cosmological constant , represent the analogs of the standard schwarzschild-(a)ds solutions , which were absent in the original hoava model .",
    "the `` projectability condition '' essentially stems from the fundamental symmetry of the theory , i.e. , the foliation - preserving diffeomorphism invariance , and must be respected .",
    "foliation - preserving diffeomorphism consists of a 3dim spatial and the space - independent time reparametrization .",
    "ir - modified hoava gravity seems to be consistent with the current observational data @xcite , but in order to test its viability more observational constraints are necessary . in @xcite the possibility of observationally testing hoava gravity was considered by using the accretion disk properties around black holes .",

    "it was shown that particular signatures can appear in the electromagnetic spectrum , thus leading to the possibility of directly testing hoava gravity models by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks . in this paper",
    ", we further explore the possibility of testing the viability of hoava - lifshitz gravity using thin accretion disk properties , and we generalize the previous results from @xcite to the case of the slowly rotating hoava - lifshitz black holes .",
    "as for the slowly rotating hoava - lifshitz black hole , we adopt the solution obtained in @xcite , and we carry out an analysis of the properties of the radiation emerging from the surface of the disk . for more information on thin accretion disks around compact objects",

    "it is also important to emphasize that the slowly rotating kerr black hole is recovered from the slowly rotating black hole solutions in hoava gravity , in the ir limit of @xmath1 . as compared to the standard general relativistic case , significant differences appear in the energy flux and electromagnetic spectrum for hoava black holes , thus leading to the possibility of directly testing the hoava - lifshitz theory by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks .",

    "the formalism has been extensively presented in the literature . however , in order to analyze the electromagnetic signatures of thin accretion disks around slowly rotating black holes , for self - completeness and self - consistency , we consider the main results of stationary and axially symmetric spacetimes in this section and the physical properties of accretion disks in appendix [ app1 ] .    the physical properties and the electromagnetic radiation characteristics of particles moving in circular orbits around compact bodies are determined by the geometry of the spacetime around the compact object . for a stationary and axially symmetric geometry",
    "the metric is given in a general form by @xmath46 in the equatorial approximation , i.e. , @xmath47 , which is the case of interest for our analysis , the metric functions @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 only depend on the radial coordinate @xmath29 .    to compute the relevant physical quantities of the thin accretion disks , we determine first the radial dependence of the angular velocity @xmath53 , of the specific energy @xmath54 , and of the specific angular momentum @xmath55 , respectively , of particles moving in circular orbits in a stationary and axially symmetric geometry .",

    "this decrease is not only a relative decrease , but the curves fall to zero , instead of following the increase of the general relativistic case .",
    "hence @xmath91 has a maximal value for each pair of the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath18 , as opposed to the angular velocity of the particles rotating around a kerr black hole , where @xmath91 remains a monotonous increasing function as we approach the horizon .",

    ", the deviation of the spacetime geometry of the ks black hole from the geometry of the schwarzschild black hole is enhanced . as a result , the flux profiles exhibit higher and higher differences . for low values of @xmath18",
    "we obtain a higher maximal flux , as the inner edge of the accretion disk is shifted to lower radii ( left edges of the flux profiles in the plots ) .",
    "the location of the flux maximum has a similar shift : with decreasing @xmath18 , @xmath96 is shifted to lower radii . by comparing the flux maxima",
    "we see that @xmath96 is about 1.4 times higher for the minimal value of @xmath18 than the maximum derived for the schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "similar trends can be found for the slowly rotating cases shown in the rest of the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the configurations with decreasing values of @xmath18 produce higher and higher flux values .",
    "the increase in the fluxes are again due to the increase in the surface of the accretion disk around the rotating ks black holes .",
    "these increase is clearly indicated by the large shifts of the inner disk edge to lower radii .",
    "comparing these figures with the static case , both the shift of the inner edge and the enhancement in the flux amplitudes are much higher for the same values of @xmath18 : for @xmath99 , the maximal flux is already more than two times higher than @xmath96 derived for the slowly rotating kerr solution . by further increasing @xmath73 , we can also increase the effect of the variation of @xmath18 on the radial structure of the standard thin accretion disk .",
    "we have seen that there is a critical value of the spin parameter for each @xmath18 , above which no marginally stable orbits can exist outside the horizon of the kehagias - safest black holes .",
    "if @xmath73 exceeds this critical value , then the inner edge of the accretion disk is already located at the horizon , and the disk surface is considerably increased , as compared to the configuration with the spin parameter somewhat lower than the critical value . as a result , the amplitudes of the integrated flux have an enormous increase , i.e , there is a strong enhancement in the thermal radiation released from the disk surface .    a deeper physical interpretation of the breakdown of the standard accretion disk model for @xmath100 may be associated with these high flux values .",
    "some composite accretion disk models consider a geometrically thick and optically thin hot corona , positioned between the marginally stable orbit and the inner edge of the geometrically thin , and optically thick , accretion disk , where an inner edge is lying at a few gravitational radii @xcite .",
    "in other type of composite models , the corona lies above and under the accretion disk , and the soft photons , arriving from the disk , produce a hard emission via their inverse comptonization by the thermally hot electrons in the corona @xcite . in both configurations",
    ", the disk is truncated at several gravitational radii - reducing the soft photon flux of the disk - and the soft and hard components of the broad band x - ray spectra of black holes were attributed to the thermal radiation of the accretion disk and the emission mechanism in the corona , respectively . for ks",
    "black holes the innermost region of the disk with @xmath101 may indicate the presence of a hot corona where the rest mass accretion together with the energy and the angular momentum transport from the disk for @xmath102 to the region of the corona at lower radii can not be described with the geometrically thin disk scheme .",
    "thermal cooling of the corona via radiation is not able to maintain a thermodynamical equilibrium and the transport processes are dominated by heat conduction in the outer region of the corona or advection in a geometrically thick disk between @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the core of the corona . in order to give a detailed description of the mechanism driving matter , energy and angular momentum into the black hole in the innermost region",
    ", one should construct at least a semi - analytic model without vertical averaging of the physical quantities of the accretion disk .    here",
    "we carry out the analysis of the presence of the critical behavior only in the framework of the standards novikov - thorne disk models , which can still provide useful information about the whole phenomenon .",
    "this effect can be seen in the last two plots in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . since for @xmath105",
    "the value @xmath84 is still under the critical value of the spin parameter , the maximal flux has still a moderate increase .",
    "if we set @xmath18 to @xmath106 or higher values , @xmath84 exceeds the critical spin value shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , and the left edge of the flux profile is located at radii @xmath107",
    ". nevertheless , these radii are still much higher than @xmath108 obtained for the corresponding values of @xmath18 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the radius @xmath104 at which @xmath53 attains its maximal value is greater than @xmath103 . for",
    "lower radii @xmath91 is already decreasing , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] , and from eq .",

    "close to the inner edge of the disk , other processes might play a role in cooling the disk , and the standard thin disk model likely breaks down in this region .",
    "for @xmath102 the latter model still seems to be a satisfying description , and thus we can assume that the disk is in the state of the thermal equilibrium or at least very close to it .",
    "if for a given @xmath18 the spin exceeds the critical value , then the minimal radius of the radiating disk surface is determined by the location of the keplerian orbit with the maximal rotational frequency . as fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] shows , the value of the radial coordinate at which @xmath91 is maximal is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "hence , this radius is maximal for the minimal value of @xmath18 , and the disk surface emitting thermal photons is minimal .",
    "then , above the critical spin value , the relation between the flux maxima and the value of the parameter @xmath18 is inverted in comparison with the trends found below the critical spin value .",
    "this means that the higher the value of @xmath18 ( the smaller the deviation from the general relativistic geometry ) , the higher the value of the maximal flux , and the lower the radial coordinate of the inner edge of the radiating zone .    at the limit @xmath109 of the slow rotating regime , the flux maximum is three orders of magnitudes higher for @xmath110 than the maximal value of @xmath92 obtained for kerr black holes .",
    "for all the values of @xmath18 presented in the last plot the spin value is higher than the critical value and each configuration of the thin disk rotating around the ks black hole emits much more thermal photons than the disk rotating around the kerr black hole do .",
    "this holds even for the minimal value of @xmath18 . for @xmath111 we can still reach the limit above which @xmath73 is no longer greater than the critical spin value , and we can approach the lower flux values , which are typical for general relativistic black holes .",
    "+      this enhancement in the sensitivity of the variation of @xmath18 can be studied in the radial profiles of the disk temperature as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present the distribution of the disk temperature for the same values of the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath18 used in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",

    "however , for the slowly rotating cases up to @xmath109 , the cut - off frequency can be enhanced by decreasing the value of @xmath18 , and the maximal amplitudes have a moderate increase as compared with the general relativistic black holes .    in the cases where for a given @xmath18",
    ", @xmath73 exceeds the value of the critical spin , the differences are considerable , indicating that the accretion disks rotating around a slowly rotating ks black hole have bluer spectra than the disks rotating around a kerr black hole with identical mass and spin parameter . both the increase in the amplitude and the shift in the cut - off frequency is proportional to the radiating surface of the disk .",

    "however , this transport may still not determine drastic changes in the standard thin disk model .",
    "hence , we expect that in this region the efficiency could still be very high , though not 100% .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the kehagias - sfetsos black holes convert accreted mass to radiation in a more efficient way than general relativistic black holes do .",
    "this enhancement in efficiency occurs even if the disk located around the rotating ks black holes can emit thermal photons only over some part of its entire surface area .",
    ".the efficiency ( measured in percents ) , and the values of the radius divided by @xmath32 at the inner edge ( values in parenthesis ) of the accretion disk for slowly - rotating black holes in general relativity , and in the hl modified theory of gravity with the rotating ks solution .",
    "the case of @xmath97 corresponds to the general relativistic case . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the present paper , we have studied thin accretion disk models for the slowly rotating kehagias and sfetsos black hole solution in hoava gravity , and we have carried out an analysis of the properties of the radiation emerging from the surface of the disk . by comparing the accretion disk properties in the slowly rotating geometry in the hoava - lifshitz gravity with the properties of disks around a slowly rotating kerr black hole , we have shown that the intensity of the flux emerging from the disk surface is greater for the slowly rotating kehagias and sfetsos solution than for the general relativistic rotating kerr black hole with the same geometrical mass @xmath144 and accretion rate @xmath145 . if this difference is in the range of 20%-80% for the case of slowly rotating black holes , in the case of ks black holes with @xmath73 of the order of @xmath146 , the increase in the flux could be several orders of magnitude higher than for a kerr black hole .",
    "thus extreme high energy emissions from accretion disks around black hole candidates may provide the distinctive signature for a ks black hole .",
    "we have also presented the conversion efficiency @xmath141 of the accreting mass into radiation , and we have showed that the slowly rotating kehagias and sfetsos black holes are much more efficient in converting the accreting mass into radiation than their kerr black holes counterparts .    from an observational point of view , the determination of the mass and of the spin of the central compact general relativistic object is a very difficult task , and in many cases , their values are not known .",
    "usually what is observed is the flux and the spectrum of the radiation coming from the accretion disk .",
    "therefore , an essential problem that has to be considered is what properties of the radiation spectrum and flux , respectively , could indicate that the observed black hole is a kehagias and sfetsos black hole of the hoava - lifshitz gravity , rather than a standard kerr black hole , with a different mass and spin . with the use of eqs .",
    "( [ scal1])-([scal4 ] ) we can always describe the properties of the accretion disk in terms of an `` effective '' kerr black hole , with a given `` effective '' mass and spin , respectively . since for a kehagias and sfetsos black hole",
    "the emitted energy flux could be several orders of magnitude higher than for a kerr black hole , for a given maximal value of @xmath147 , the observed high flux from the kehagias and sfetsos black hole would require an unrealistically high mass for the central general relativistic compact object .",
    "moreover , for the kehagias and sfetsos black hole the maximum of the flux is displaced toward smaller values of @xmath148 , as compared to the kerr case .",
    "hence a very high kerr mass of the central object , and the position of the maximum of the spectrum could represent an important observational evidence for the existence of the kehagias and sfetsos black holes .",
    "therefore , the study of the accretion processes by compact objects is a powerful indicator of their physical nature .",
    "since the energy flux , the temperature distribution of the disk , the spectrum of the emitted black body radiation , as well as the conversion efficiency show , in the case of the hoava - lifshitz theory vacuum solutions , significant differences as compared to the general relativistic case , the determination of these observational quantities could discriminate , at least in principle , between standard general relativity and hoava - lifshitz theory , and constrain the parameters of the model .",

    "for a thin accretion disk the vertical size ( defined in cylindrical coordinates along the @xmath149-axis ) is negligible , as compared to its horizontal extension ( defined along the radial direction @xmath29 ) , i.e. , the disk height @xmath150 , equal to the maximum half thickness of the disk , is always much smaller than the characteristic radius @xmath151 of the disk , @xmath152 .",
    "the thin disk is assumed to be in hydrodynamical equilibrium , and the pressure gradient , as well as the vertical entropy gradient , are negligible in the disk .",
    "the efficient cooling via the radiation over the disk surface prevents the disk from cumulating the heat generated by stresses and dynamical friction . in turn",
    ", this equilibrium causes the disk to stabilize its thin vertical size .",
    "the thin disk has an inner edge at the marginally stable orbit of the compact object potential , and the accreting matter has a keplerian motion in higher orbits .    in steady - state accretion disk models , the mass accretion rate @xmath153 is assumed to be a constant that does not change with time .",
    "the physical quantities describing the orbiting matter are averaged over a characteristic time scale , e.g. @xmath154 , for a total period of the orbits , over the azimuthal angle @xmath155 , and over the height @xmath150 @xcite .    the particles moving in keplerian orbits around the compact object with a rotational velocity @xmath156 have a specific energy @xmath157 and a specific angular momentum @xmath158 which in the steady - state thin disk model depend only on the radii of the orbits . these particles , orbiting with the four - velocity @xmath159 , form a disk of an averaged surface density @xmath160 , the vertically integrated average of the rest mass density @xmath161 of the plasma .",
    "the accreting matter in the disk is modeled by an anisotropic fluid source , where the density @xmath161 , the energy flow vector @xmath162 and the stress tensor @xmath163 are measured in the averaged rest - frame ( the specific heat was neglected ) . then , the disk structure can be characterized by the surface density of the disk @xcite @xmath164 with averaged rest mass density @xmath165 over @xmath154 and @xmath166 and the torque @xmath167 with the averaged component @xmath168 over @xmath154 and @xmath169 .",

    ", it follows that the time averaged rate of the accretion of the rest mass is independent of the disk radius , @xmath177    applying the conservation law @xmath178 of the energy has the integral form @xmath179_{,r } = 4\\pi r   f% \\widetilde{e } ,   \\label{conslawofe}\\ ] ] which states that the energy transported by the rest mass flow , @xmath180 , and the energy transported by the dynamical stresses in the disk , @xmath181 , is in balance with the energy radiated away from the surface of the disk , @xmath182 .",

    "( [ conslawofe ] ) and ( [ conslawofl ] ) , and applying the universal energy - angular momentum relation @xmath186 for circular geodesic orbits in the form @xmath187 , the flux @xmath95 of the radiant energy over the disk can be expressed in terms of the specific energy , angular momentum and of the angular velocity of the compact sphere @xcite , @xmath188    another important characteristic of the mass accretion process is the efficiency with which the central object converts rest mass into outgoing radiation .",
    "this quantity is defined as the ratio of the rate of the radiation of the energy of photons escaping from the disk surface to infinity , and the rate at which mass - energy is transported to the central compact general relativistic object , both measured at infinity @xcite . since",

    "the accretion of the rest mass @xmath190 producing a growth in the total mass - energy of the central object proportional to the specific energy of the gas particles leaving the marginally stable orbit , i.e @xmath191 . therefore the efficiency is given in terms of the specific energy measured at the marginally stable orbit @xmath79 , @xmath192 provided all the emitted photons can escape to infinity .    for schwarzschild black holes the efficiency @xmath193 is about @xmath194 , whether the photon capture by the black hole",

    "the accreting matter in the steady - state thin disk model is supposed to be in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "therefore the radiation emitted by the disk surface can be considered as a perfect black body radiation , where the energy flux is given by @xmath197 ( @xmath198 is the stefan - boltzmann constant ) , and the observed luminosity @xmath199 has a redshifted black body spectrum @xcite : @xmath200    here @xmath201 is the distance to the source , @xmath202 is the planck distribution function , @xmath203 is the disk inclination angle , and @xmath204 and @xmath205 indicate the position of the inner and outer edge of the disk , respectively .",
