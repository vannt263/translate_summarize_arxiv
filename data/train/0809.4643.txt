    "thermoelectricity concerns the conversion of temperature differences into electric potential or vice - versa .",
    "it can be used to perform useful electrical work or to pump heat from cold to hot place , thus performing refrigeration .",
    "although thermoelectricity was discovered almost 200 years ago , a strong interest of the scientific community arose only in the 1950 s when abram ioffe discovered that doped semiconductors exhibit relatively large thermoelectric effect .",
    "this initiated an intense research activity in semiconductors physics which was not motivated by microelectronics but by the ioffe suggestion that home refrigerators could be built with semiconductors @xcite . as a result of these efforts",
    "the thermoelectric material @xmath0 was developed for commercial purposes .",
    "however this activity lasted only few years until the mid 1960 s since , in spite of all efforts and consideration of all type of semiconductors , it turned out that thermoelectric refrigerators have still poor efficiency as compared to compressor based refrigerators . nowadays",
    "peltier refrigerators are mainly used in situations in which reliability and quiet operation , and not the cost and conversion efficiency , is the main concern , like equipments in medical applications , space probes etc . in the last decade",
    "there has been an increasing pressure to find better thermoelectric materials with higher efficiency .",
    "the reason is the strong environmental concern about chlorofluorocarbons used in most compressor - based refrigerators .",
    "also the possibility to generate electric power from waste heat using thermoelectric effect is becoming more and more interesting @xcite .",
    "the suitability of a thermoelectric material for energy conversion or electronic refrigeration is evaluated by the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath1 ,    [ eq : zt - def ] z =  ,    where @xmath2 is the coefficient of electric conductivity , @xmath3 is the seebeck coefficient and @xmath4 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "the seebeck coefficient @xmath3 , also called thermopower , is a measure of the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a temperature difference across the material .    for a given material , and a pair of temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 of hot and cold thermal baths respectively , @xmath1 is related to the _ efficiency _ @xmath7 of converting the heat current @xmath8 ( between the baths ) into the electric power @xmath9 which is generated by attaching a thermoelectric element to an optimal ohmic impedance .",
    "namely , in the linear regime :    [ eq : efficiency ] = = _  ,    where @xmath10 is the carnot efficiency and @xmath11 .",
    "thus a good thermoelectric device is characterized by a large value of the non - dimensional figure of merit @xmath12 .",
    "since the 1960 s many materials have been investigated but the maximum value found for @xmath12 was achieved for the @xmath13 alloy family with @xmath14 .",
    "however , values @xmath15 are considered to be essential for thermoelectrics to compete in efficiency with mechanical power generation and refrigeration at room temperatures .",
    "the efforts recently focused on a bulk of new advanced thermoelectric materials and on low - dimensional materials , and only a small increment of the efficiency , @xmath16 , has been obtained @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons for this partial success is a limited understanding of the possible microscopic mechanisms leading to the increase of @xmath12 , with few exceptions @xcite . from a dynamical point of view , cross effects in transport have been barely studied @xcite .",
    "so far , the challenge lies in engineering a material for which the values of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 can be controlled independently .",
    "however , the different transport coefficients are interdependent , making optimization extremely difficult .    in a recent paper",
    ", we have studied the thermoelectric process in a gas of non - interacting polyatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "we showed that large values of @xmath12 , in principle approaching to carnot s efficiency , are obtained when the number of the molecule s internal degrees of freedom ( ) is increased . using the rotating - disk interaction introduced in @xcite , in this paper , we study the effect that a generic particle - particle interaction has on the te efficiency of these systems . in the following section [ sec : te ] ,",
    "we review briefly the microscopic expressions for the te process in ergodic ideal gases obtained in @xcite . in the section [ sec : int ] ,",
    "we study numerically , the modifications to these expressions , due to the interaction .",
    "our conclusions appear in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in the linear response regime ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , the transport equations for a thermoelectric material give the heat current @xmath8 and the electric current @xmath17 through an homogeneous sample subjected to a temperature gradient @xmath18 and a electrochemical potential gradient @xmath19 as    [ eq : ju1 ] & j_q &  =  & -  t - t s  , + & j_e &  =  & - s t -  .",
    "here and in what follows , we assume that the transport occurs along the @xmath20-direction and the temperature is given in units where the boltzmann constant @xmath21 .",
    "the electrochemical potential is the sum of a chemical and an electric part @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the chemical potential of the particles and , if @xmath24 is the particle s charge , @xmath25 is the work done by the particles against an external electric field @xmath26 . from ( [ eq : ju1 ] ) the usual phenomenological relations follow : if the thermal gradient vanishes , @xmath27 , then @xmath28 , since for an isothermal homogeneous system @xmath23 is uniform .",
    "if the electric current vanishes , @xmath29 , then @xmath30 , which is the definition of the seebeck coefficient , and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the usual thermal conductivity ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .    from the theory of irreversible thermodynamics , @xmath23 and @xmath33 can not be determined separately ; only their combination in @xmath34 appears in @xcite . based on this equivalence , in what follows",
    "we take into account the chemical part only , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath35 .",
    "since in the linear regime in which dissipative effects , such as , _ e.g. _ , joule heating , can be neglected and at low particle densities , thermodiffusion and thermoelectricity are equivalent process , we can study te in terms of the thermodiffusion transport equations    [ eq : ju2 ] & j_u &  =  & l_uu+ l_u , + & j _ &  =  & l_u+ l _  ,    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the energy and particle density currents , and @xmath38 follows from the onsager reciprocity relations . from the entropy balance equation for open systems @xcite    [ eq : ju - def ] j_u = j_q + j",

    "note that for a chaotic billiard channel with a diffusive dynamics , the transmission probability decays as @xmath65 which means that all the elements of the onsager matrix @xmath66 become size independent .    finally , plugging into and noting that @xmath67 is the dimensionless heat capacity at constant volume of the gas",
