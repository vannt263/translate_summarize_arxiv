    "the fireball shock model ( see , e.g. , mszros 2002 and zhang & mszros 2004 for reviews ) has been widely accepted to interpret the gamma - ray and afterglow emitting of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . despite the successes of this phenomenological model , the central engine of the relativistic fireball is not yet well understood .",
    "most popular models for the energy source of grbs are in common invoking a hyperaccreting black hole .",
    "accretion models in this context were first considered by narayan , paczyski , & piran ( 1992 ) , and have been recently discussed by popham , woosley , & fryer ( 1999 , hereafter pwf ) , narayan , piran , & kumar ( 2001 ) , kohri & mineshige ( 2002 ) , di matteo , piran , & narayan ( 2002 , hereafter dpn ) , and kohri , narayan , & piran ( 2005 ) .",
    "pwf introduced the concept of neutrino - dominated accretion flows ( ndafs ) and showed that the energy released by neutrino annihilation was adequate for grbs .",
    "their calculations , however , were based on the assumption that the flow is optically thin for neutrinos . as pointed out by themselves , this assumption breaks down for the mass accretion rate @xmath0 s@xmath1 .",
    "they mentioned that their estimate of the neutrino annihilation luminosity @xmath2 ( see their table  3 ) for @xmath3 s@xmath1 should be taken as an upper limit , and the actual luminosity could be as much as a factor of 5 lower , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "the ndaf model was reinvestigated by dpn , in which a bridging formula was adopted for calculating neutrino radiation in both the optically thin and thick cases .",
    "they showed that for @xmath5 s@xmath1 there exists an optically thick inner region in the flow ; and argued that for @xmath6 s@xmath1 neutrinos are sufficiently trapped and energy advection becomes the dominant cooling mechanism , resulting in the maximum luminosity of neutrino annihilation which is only @xmath7 ( see their fig .",
    "thus they claimed that the ndaf model can not account for grbs .    how to understand the inconsistent results of pwf and dpn ?",
    "we note that pwf worked in the relativistic kerr geometry , but with the a priori assumption that neutrinos are optically thin ; whereas dpn calculated the optical depth for neutrinos , but went back into the newtonian potential and omitted totally the neutrino radiation from the optically thick region .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to try to update partly the ndaf model .",
    "it is surely correct that the general relativistic effect must be considered in studies of black hole accretion , then we wish to know how important the effect of the neutrino opacity is in determining the luminosity of an ndaf .",
    "for simplicity , a steady state axisymmetric black hole accretion flow is considered as in pwf and dpn .",
    "we adopt that the general relativistic effect of the central black hole is simulated by the well - known pseudo - newtonian potential introduced by paczyski & wiita ( 1980 , hereafter pw potential ) , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the black hole mass , @xmath10 is the radius , and @xmath11 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "other assumptions about the flow are usual in the literature : the angular velocity is approximately keplerian , i.e. , @xmath12 ; the vertical scale height of the flow is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the isothermal sound speed , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the pressure and mass density , respectively ; and the kinematic viscosity coefficient is expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the constant viscosity parameter .    the basic equations describing the flow consist of the continuity , azimuthal momentum , and energy equations plus the equation of state .",
    "the continuity equation is = -4 h r v  , where @xmath19 is the radial velocity . with the assumption @xmath20",
    ", the azimuthal momentum equation is reduced to an algebraic form : v = - f^-1 g  , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with the integration constant @xmath23 representing the specific angular momentum ( per unit mass ) accreted by the black hole . the equation of state is written as p = p_gas + p_rad + p_deg + p _  , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the gas pressure from nucleons , radiation pressure of photons , degeneracy pressure of electrons , and radiation pressure of neutrinos , respectively .",
    "the energy equation is written as = + q_photo +  .",
    "the viscous heating @xmath28 and the advective cooling @xmath29 ( for a half disk above or below the equator ) are expressed as = m ^2 f g  , = h v t - v t ( at^3 + + )  , where @xmath30 is the temperature , @xmath31 is the specific entropy , @xmath32 is the mass fraction of free nucleons , @xmath33 is the neutrino energy density , and @xmath34 is assumed to be equal to 1 as in dpn .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is the cooling of the photodisintegration process , and @xmath36 is the cooling of the neutrino radiation . we adopt a bridging formula for calculating @xmath36 , which is valid in both the optically thin and thick cases .",
    "detailed expressions for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath35 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the bridging formula for @xmath36 are given in dpn .",
    "equations  ( 1 - 4 ) contain four independent unknowns @xmath16 , @xmath30 , @xmath37 , and @xmath19 as functions of @xmath10 , which can be numerically solved with given constant parameters @xmath9 , @xmath38 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 , then all the other quantities can be obtained . in the following calculations we fix @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "most previous calculations for ndafs ( e.g. , narayan et al . 2001 ; dpn ; kohri et al . 2005 ) adopted the newtonian potential and did not take the integration constant @xmath23 into consideration .",
    "kohri & mineshige ( 2002 ) also used the newtonian potential but considered @xmath23 .",
    "only pwf worked in the relativistic kerr geometry as we mentioned already . in this section",
    "we refine the fixed concept in the literature , i.e. , the invalidity of the usage of the newtonian potential .",
    "we concentrate on three solutions corresponding to pw potential with @xmath41 ( just a little less than the keplerian angular momentum at the last stable orbit , @xmath42 ) , the newtonian potential with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , cf .",
    "kohri & mineshige 2002 ) , and the newtonian potential with @xmath45 ( dpn ; kohri et al .",
    "2005 ) , respectively .",
    "the variation of the optical depth @xmath46 for neutrinos with @xmath10 is drawn in figure  1(a ) , for which the dimensionless mass accretion rate is @xmath47 s@xmath48 .",
    "the figure shows that the values of @xmath46 in the newtonian potential ( the dotted and dashed lines ) are significantly larger than those in pw potential ( the solid line ) .",
    "the accretion flow in pw potential is completely optically thin ( @xmath49 ) , whereas for the newtonian potential with @xmath45 there exists a wide optically thick ( @xmath50 ) region of @xmath51 .",
    "we believe that the results with pw potential are more convincible since this potential is known to be a better description for a nonrotating black hole than the newtonian potential .",
    "our arguement can be further confirmed by figure  1(b ) , which shows the variation of @xmath52 with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the efficiency of energy release by neutrino radiation ( before annihilation ) . as seen in the figure ,",
    "@xmath52 in the newtonian potential is much larger than that in pw potential . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the former can reach a maximum value of @xmath55 at @xmath56 , which is far beyond the maximum possible efficiency in the schwarzschild geometry ( @xmath57 ) and is unphysical .",
    "in fact , by integrating the viscous heating @xmath28 from @xmath58 to the infinite outer boundary of the flow , we can obtain the theoretical maximum @xmath59 for the above three solutions : @xmath60 for the newtonian potential with @xmath45 [ from eq .",
    "( 14 ) of dpn ] , @xmath61 for the newtonian potential with @xmath62 [ from eq .  ( 32 ) of kohri & mineshige 2002 ] , and @xmath63 for pw potential with @xmath64 .",
    "obviously the result with pw potential is the closest to the reality ( @xmath65 ) , while the results with the newtonian potential are unreasonable .",
    "we conclude for the moment that the usage of the newtonian potential is invalid in calculations for ndafs at least at the following two points : ( 1 ) it would overestimate substantially the optical depth for neutrinos ; ( 2 ) it would lead to an unphysical efficiency of energy release by neutrino radiation .",
    "our method for calculating neutrino annihilation is similar to many previous works ( e.g. , ruffert et al . 1997 ; pwf ; rosswog , ramirez - ruiz , & davies 2003 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the variations of @xmath66 ( the upper thin solid line ) and @xmath67 ( the lower thick solid line ) with @xmath53 , where @xmath66 is the luminosity of neutrino radiation before annihilation , and @xmath67 is the luminosity of neutrino annihilation ( which is the most important from the observational point of view ) , both of them are calculated with pw potential .",
    "the circles and triangles represent the results of pwf for @xmath66 ( empty ) and @xmath67 ( filled ) , respectively .",
    "it is seen that our results agree very well with that of pwf for @xmath68 , because pw potential is a good approximation for the schwarzschild geometry . for @xmath69 ,",
    "our results are lower than that of pwf .",
    "this is because they assumed neutrinos to be optically thin ; while we use the bridging formula for @xmath36 , and there exists an optically thick region for @xmath70 . according to our calculations @xmath67 varies from @xmath71 to @xmath72 for @xmath73 , which implies that , based on the energy consideration , ndaf can indeed work as the central engine for grbs . in particular , our @xmath67 ( @xmath72 ) for @xmath74 is in good agreement with pwf s  actual luminosity \" ( @xmath4 , as mentioned in   1 ) .    for comparison , figure  2 also shows @xmath67 in other three cases : ( 1 ) using pw potential but omitting the contribution from the optically thick region ( the dotted line , the @xmath50 region appears for @xmath70 ) ; ( 2 ) using the newtonian potential and including the contribution from the optically thick region ( the dot - dashed line ) ; and ( 3 ) using the newtonian potential but omitting that contribution ( the dashed line , the @xmath50 region appears for @xmath75 ) . as known from   3 ,",
    "the results of cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are unreal because the usage of the newtonian potential overestimates unphysically both @xmath46 and @xmath66 .",
    "it is seen that the omitting of the contribution from the @xmath50 region reduces substantially @xmath67 in case ( 3 ) , i.e. , even with the overestimated @xmath66 caused by the newtonian potential ; as well as in case ( 1 ) , i.e. , even the general relativistic effect is considered .",
    "this is probably the reason why dpn obtained @xmath67 in their newtonian calculations which is insufficient for grbs .",
    "we think that it is unfair to ignore totally the neutrino radiation from the @xmath50 region .",
    "as dpn also stated , the neutrino emission is partially suppressed as the inner regions of the flow are becoming opaque .",
    "the trapping of neutrinos is a process that is strengthening gradually with increasing @xmath46 , the value of @xmath46 reaching 2/3 does not mean that all neutrinos are suddenly trapped , and the use of the bridging formula for @xmath36 is exactly to calculate the neutrino radiation from both the optically thin and thick regions .",
    "a similar bridging formula has been widely used for calculating the radiation of photons in both the optically thin and thick cases ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "dpn argued that energy advection would become the dominant cooling mechanism when the flow is optically thick for neutrinos .",
    "as seen from their fig .  3 , however , it is not the case .",
    "for example , for @xmath76 the flow is optically thick at @xmath77 , but the advection factor @xmath78 at this radius is only @xmath79 . in our opinion , whether cooling is dominated by advection or by radiation is not determined by the optical depth . for",
    "accretion flows in x - ray binaries and agns , it is known that @xmath80 is relevant to the geometrical depth rather than the optical depth of the flow ( abramowicz , lasota , & xu 1986 ) : f_adv ( ) ^2  .",
    "such a relationship can be well checked by the four representative types of accretion models : the optically thick standard thin disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) and the optically thin sle disk ( shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ) are both geometrically thin and radiation - dominated , i.e. , @xmath81 ; and the optically thick slim disk ( abramowicz et al . 1988 ) and the optically thin advection - dominated accretion flow ( narayan & yi 1994 ) are both geometrically thick and advection - dominated , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
    "we argue that this relationship should also work in the ndaf model with the following modification in accordance with pw potential : f_adv f_h ( ) ^2 f^-1 g^-1  , where @xmath83 is called by us the geometrical depth factor , and @xmath84 comes from the expression of @xmath28 [ eq .",
    "( 5 ) ] .",
    "as shown in figure  3 , the variation of @xmath80 with @xmath10 ( the solid line ) agrees very well with that of @xmath83 ( the dot - dashed line ) , but differs significantly from that of @xmath46 ( the dotted line ) , clearly indicating that the strength of energy advection is relevant to the geometrical depth rather than the optical depth .",
    "it is also seen that , although the flow is optically thick for @xmath85 , advection dominates over neutrino cooling ( @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is drawn by the dashed line ) only in a smaller region @xmath88 .",
    "once again , this result supports the view that it is important to consider the role of the optically thick , but neutrino radiation - dominated region , e.g. , @xmath89 in the example of figure  3 .",
    "we have shown that the usage of the newtonian potential along with the omitting of neutrino radiation from the optically thick region would lead to unreal luminosities for ndafs , and that when the general relativistic effect is considered and the contribution from the optically thick region is included , ndafs can work as the central engine for grbs .",
    "in addition to its mass , a black hole may have its spin as the other fundamental property .",
    "we consider here only the nonrotating black hole , for which pw potential can work .",
    "pwf has shown that a spining ( kerr ) black hole will enhance the efficiency of neutrino radiation .",
    "this strengthens our conclusion here that ndafs into black holes can be the central engine for grbs .",
    "we have tried to update partly the ndaf model by considering both the effects of general relativity and neutrino opacity .",
    "there are certainly other factors which may influence the neutrino luminosity of an ndaf and we do not consider here , such as the electron degeneracy . we adopt a simple treatment for the electron degeneracy pressure in agreement with pwf and dpn .",
    "kohri & mineshige ( 2002 ) pointed out that it is important to include the effect of electron degeneracy that suppresses the neutrino cooling at high density and high temperature .",
    "most recently , kohri et al . (",
    "2005 ) considered the effects of both electron degeneracy and neutrino optical depth , and calculated the neutrino cooling , the electron pressure , and other physical quantities even in the delicate regime where the electron degeneracy is moderate ; while in previous works as well as ours here the calculations can be made accurate only in the two opposite limits of extremely degenerate electrons and fully nondegenerate electrons .",
    "we wish to see in future studies how the electron degeneracy would affect our results here .",
