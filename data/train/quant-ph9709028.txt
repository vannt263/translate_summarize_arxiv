    "one of the most transparent pictures of the scrdinger s eigenvalue equation in 1-dimension is obtained by reinterpreting the space coordinate @xmath1 as the `` time '' ( @xmath2 ) , and the values of the wave function @xmath0 and its derivative @xmath3 as the position and momentum of a classical point particle  @xcite .",
    "the resulting classical trajectory obeys hamilton equations which can be further simplified by introducing the prfer s angle on the poincare plane  @xcite .",
    "the integration of the 1-st order `` angular equation '' then turns out one of the most efficient methods to determine the energy spectra  @xcite . in this note",
    "we show that the classical algorithm works even better for the helmholtz problem  @xcite ; in addition , it exhibits a new aspect of the helmholtz spectra .",
    "given an interval @xmath4 \\subset { \\bf r}$ ] and a real function @xmath5 \\rightarrow { \\bf r}$ ] , the _ helmholtz equation _ is a particular case of a sturm - liouville problem ( see  @xcite ) :    @xmath6    and the _ helmholtz spectrum _ is defined as the set of all @xmath7 for which ( 2.1 ) has a non trivial solution @xmath8 vanishing on both ends :    @xmath9    the trajectory picture  @xcite applies quite naturally to the helmholtz eigenproblem , and the spectral condition is much simpler than in the schrdinger s case .",
    "let @xmath10 be any real solution of ( 2.1 ) .",
    "define : @xmath2 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ; eq . ( 2.1 ) then becomes :    @xmath13    with the spectral condition :    @xmath14    observe , that ( 2.3 ) are the canonical equations for a classical point - particle with the hamiltonian :    @xmath15    each integral trajectory of ( 2.3 ) portraits a wave function @xmath0 and its first derivative .",
    "we shall further assume that @xmath16 is a piece - wise continuous function in @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the attractive oscillator force in ( 2.3 ) then drives the classical trajectory clockwise around the origin of the phase plane ( fig .",
    "when @xmath17 grows to @xmath18 , the end point @xmath19 must cross the @xmath20 axis an infinite number of times ( fig .",
    "each time this happens , @xmath17 belongs to the point spectrum of ( 2.1 ) . in this way",
    "the helmholtz eigenproblem ( 2.1 ) has a discrete spectrum in the form of an infinite ladder of positive eigenvalues determined by the classical trajectories ( compare the theorems  @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of the spectral values can be carried out by introducing the polar variables on the phase plane : @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the variable @xmath23 then separates and ( 2.3 ) reads  @xcite :    @xmath24    with the initial and spectral conditions :    @xmath25    some exact solutions of ( 2.1 - 2 ) were recently studied by goyal et al to check the validity of the wkb and langer approximations  @xcite . for curiosity",

    "the last column gives the _optical information_ , disregarded in the literature .",
    "as one can see , for the low eigenvalues the ranking is won by the almost ignored angular algorithm ( both , in number of digits and simplicity of operation ) .",
    "its additional advantage is that it uncovers the links of the helmholtz spectrum with the techniques of generating the squeezed states .",
    "in a typical sturm - liouville problem , one looks for a solution of a differential equation which fulfills a definite _ boundary condition .",
    "the second independent solution is dimissed as unphysical .",
    "however , we shall show that for ( 2.1 ) the second solution too carries an important message . as eqs .",
    "( 2.3 ) are linear , the corresponding @xmath28 , @xmath29 depend linearly on the initial values @xmath30 , @xmath31 : _    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the simplectic _ evolution matrix _  @xcite ( also : the _ transfer matrix _ ) .",
    "the existence of a non - trivial solution of ( 2.2 ) with @xmath34 means that the evolution matrix @xmath35 in the interval @xmath4 $ ] maps :    @xmath36    and since @xmath35 is simplectic , it must be of the form :    @xmath37    once this is known , one can deduce not only the spectral orbit of ( 2.3 ) , but also the form of other trajectories .",
    "consider therefore the congruence of trajectories which diverge at @xmath38 from the initial point ( @xmath39 ) , where @xmath40 is fixed and @xmath41 varies . if @xmath17 is an eigenvalue of ( 2.1 ) and @xmath42 is of the form ( 3.3 ) , then at @xmath43 :    @xmath44    i.e. , all orbits departing from the same @xmath40 ( with different momenta p ) meet at @xmath45 ( with momenta @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues @xmath17 of ( 2.1 ) are the real numbers for which the time evolution ( 2.3 ) focuses any congruence of classical orbits diverging from any common initial @xmath40 .",
    "the optical constants @xmath47 , @xmath48 can be read from the second ( disregarded ) solution of ( 2.1 ) .",
    "note that the focusing , in general , is not the _ scale transformation  @xcite , ( as the matrix ( 3.3 ) is triangular ) , though it is an example of squeezing  @xcite .",
    "the scale transformation ( @xmath49 ) is an exceptional effect which can happen only for some @xmath50 s ( see  @xcite ) , whereas the _ focusing _ is a typical phenomenon which must occur for any positive @xmath51 , on an infinite ladder of @xmath17 s .",
    "the converse problem is as well interesting . instead of fixing an interval and looking for @xmath17 ,",
    "fix any @xmath52 and @xmath53 and consider an expanding time interval @xmath54 $ ] . if @xmath55 mantains some positive average in @xmath56 , the final point @xmath57 , as @xmath58 must cross infinity of times the @xmath41 -axis , each time generating our focusing effect no matter the exact form of @xmath59 .",
    "should @xmath59 be a random variable performing errating oscillations , the motions ( 2.3 ) will be chaotic too ; yet , for any congruence of trajectories , a clean echo effect of the initial configuration ( an amplified or reduced image ) must emerge now and then against the chaotic forces .",
    "note also that the effect must have a quantum equivalent .",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath60 in form ( 2.5 ) , where @xmath61 and @xmath41 are position and momentum operators . since ( 2.5 )",
    "is cuadratic , the quantum evolution follows faithfully the classical motions .",
    "the techniques of the classical `` piloting trajectory '' gives specially good results for the gaussian wave packets  @xcite .",
    "we shall show , that it provides also an explicit expression for the evolution operator @xmath62 :    @xmath63    with this end define :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the traditional oscillator hamiltonian and @xmath66 is a real , differentiable function .",
    "due to the well known transformation rules : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , the operator @xmath69 fulfills :    @xmath70 w(t ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice , that the time dependent term coupled to @xmath71 corresponds exactly to the prfer equation .",
    "thus , if @xmath66 is the prfer angle ( 2.6 ) , then ( 4.3 ) reduces to :    @xmath72 w(t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and integrates explicitely in terms of the prfer s radious @xmath73 :    @xmath74    inserting ( 4.5 ) into ( 4.4 ) and remembering that the first exponent in ( 4.4 ) is the scale operation , one gets :    @xmath75    and returning to ( 4.2 ) one has an explicit formula for the unitary operator @xmath62 with three exponential terms piloted by prfer variables ( 2.6 - 7 ) :    @xmath76    if in addition the number @xmath17 is the eigenvalue of the sturm - liouville problem ( 2.1 ) @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , then the first factor in ( 4.7 ) becomes @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 ) and    @xmath81    transforms any initial wave packet @xmath82 into :    @xmath83 ( x ) = { 1 \\over \\sqrt{\\sigma } } e^{i \\eta { x^2 \\over 2 \\sigma^2 } } \\psi ( x / \\sigma)\\ ] ]    where @xmath84 .",
    "the probability density @xmath85 is simultaneously mapped into its own diffractionless ]    it thus turns out that the authors looking for the squeezing parameters were indeed solving the xix - century spectral problem ! the relative simplicity of the three term formula ( 4.7 ) ( compare  @xcite ) is due to the `` bottom structure '' ( 2.6 - 9 ) .",
    "its additional implication concerns the `` potential kicks '' @xmath86 considered recently as a method of controlling and cooling quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "while the `` kicks '' are mathematically simple , they are overidealized ( no @xmath87-pulses available in laboratories ! ) .",
    "notice , however , that if @xmath17 is an eigenvalue of ( 2.1 ) and if @xmath55 is symmetric @xmath88 in a symmetric operation interval @xmath89 $ ] , then the eigenvector @xmath8 ( and consistenly the phase trajectory @xmath90 is even / odd in @xmath89 $ ] , implying the trivial squeezing @xmath91 , and the only non trivial part of ( 4.7 - 8 ) is @xmath92 . for @xmath93 , this is the unitary operator describing the results of a sharp kick of the oscillator potential @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the spectrum of ( 2.1 ) tells in addition how to `` imitate softly '' the effects of @xmath87-kicks converting the results on kicked oscillators  @xcite into a branch of realistic technology",

    "quite evidently , ( 5.4 ) is a model of ( 2.5 ) with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . if @xmath116 , the spectrum of the helmholtz equation ( 2.1 ) forms a ladder of eigenvalues , and if @xmath117 is one of them , both oscillators yield the simultaneous focus of the trajectory congruencies ( in classical case ) or probability patterns ( in quantum case ) . to check this ,",
    "we have asked the computer to draw congruencies of classical trajectories diverging from a common initial point , with a common initial @xmath118 , for @xmath114 coinciding with one of the eigenvalues of ( 2.1 ) and with @xmath119 taken from table 1 . in all cases",
    "we have obtained quite precise optical images on planes perpendicular to the solenoid axis ( see fig .",
    "the dependence of the phenomenon on the sturm - liouville spectrum is illustrated by sequences of amplified focuses corresponding exactly to the nodal points of the wave function ( 2.1 - 2 ) .",
    "henceforth , the integration of the first order differential equation of prfer ( for one variable ) offers the simplest algorithm to predict the _ optical echo _ ( squeezing ) for charged particle beams .",
