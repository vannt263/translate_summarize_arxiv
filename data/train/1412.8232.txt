    "the study of existence and properties of standing waves of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation constitutes a continuously developing subject .",
    "the nls equation has potential applications to many realistic problems such as signal propagation in optical fibers or bose ",
    "einstein condensation .",
    "standing waves are usually considered in unbounded homogeneous media @xcite or in the periodically modulated media @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , real systems can exhibit strong inhomogeneities , due to different nonlinear coefficients in different regions of the spatial domain or a specific geometry of the spatial domain .",
    "a problem of general interest is the interaction between standing waves in spatially confined systems and those in large or unbounded reservoirs .",
    "here we develop a rigorous analysis of bifurcation and stability of standing waves for the nls equation with power nonlinearity in the simplest geometry given by a ring attached to a semi - infinite line .",
    "we refer to this model geometry as to the _ tadpole graph_. at the junction between the ring and the half line , suitable boundary conditions ( referred typically to as the _ kirchhoff boundary conditions _ ) are given to define the coupling .",
    "these boundary conditions ensure conservation of the current flow through the network junction .",
    "the tadpole graph is an example of quantum graphs , a much studied subject in the last decades ( see @xcite and references therein ) with many relevant physical applications .",
    "the linear counterpart of this model , even in the presence of a magnetic field , was studied by exner @xcite .",
    "if the ring is placed on the interval @xmath0 $ ] and the semi - infinite interval is @xmath1 , then we define the laplacian operator by @xmath2,\\ ] ] acting on functions in the form @xmath3,\\ ] ] where the primes stand for spatial derivatives .",
    "we equip the laplacian operator ( [ op - delta ] ) with the domain @xmath4 where the kirchhoff boundary conditions have been used .",
    "let us show that @xmath5 is a symmetric operator from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be two elements in @xmath6 .",
    "the bilinear form for the laplacian operator satisfies @xmath10 if @xmath11 the above constraint is indeed satisfied under the kirchhoff boundary conditions in ( [ domain - delta ] ) .",
    "it further follows ( see , e.g. , theorem 1.4.4 in @xcite ) that the operator @xmath5 is in fact self - adjoint on its domain @xmath6 .",
    "the linear schrdinger equation on the tadpole graph can be written in the compact form @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "we are interested in the nonlinear schrdinger equation on the tadpole graph , which is the natural generalization of the linear schrdinger equation , @xmath14 where the nonlinear term @xmath15 is interpreted as a symbol for @xmath16 defined piecewise on @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the power nonlinearity is of the focusing type and it supports existence of localized waves on infinite or semi - infinite lines .    standard application of the fixed point theory shows that local well posedness holds in the energy space @xmath20 and in the operator domain space @xmath6 ( see @xcite for the classical theory and @xcite for applications to the nls equation on quantum graphs ) . in the case of subcritical power nonlinearities with @xmath21 , local solutions can also be extended to global solutions either in @xmath22 or in @xmath6 .",
    "standing waves of the focusing nls equation ( [ eq0 ] ) on the tadpole graph are given by the solutions of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are considered to be real .",
    "this pair satisfies the stationary nls equation @xmath26 more explicitly , using @xmath27 and @xmath28 as components of the vector @xmath29 , we can write the stationary nls equation ( [ eq ] ) as a system of two nls equations , one on the ring and the other one on the half line , coupled by the kirchhoff boundary conditions : @xmath30    the subject of nls equations on quantum graphs has seen many developments in the recent years . from the physical point of view , the most promising interest is in the experimental creation and management of various kinds of traps for bose - einstein condensates ( see @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "various types of junctions have been modeled to show formation and trapping of localized waves and existence of coherent structures with symmetry breaking @xcite .    at the rigorous mathematical level , the emphasis has been placed on the case of y - junctions or more generally on star graphs , where existence , variational properties , stability of standing waves , and scattering of localized waves have been studied , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "very little is known about propagation or formation of standing waves in more complex structures , where oscillations of waves can be present .",
    "for example , the authors of @xcite demonstrate numerically that a complex set of broad and narrow resonances shows up after inserting a single nonlinear edge in a network , where linear schrdinger propagation occurs .",
    "a result on the absence of nonlinear ground states in networks with closed cycles is given in @xcite under a set of certain topological conditions .",
    "a classification of standing waves in the present model ( [ stat - nls ] ) of the nls equation on the tadpole graph is given in @xcite for the cubic case @xmath31 .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed a rather unexpected and rich structure of the nonlinear waves of the system .",
    "several interesting bifurcations appear , giving rise to nonlinear standing waves embedded in the essential spectrum of @xmath5 , a countable set of families of localized waves bifurcating from the edge of the essential spectrum of @xmath5 , and a wealth of families of standing waves which have no linear analogues .",
    "standing waves were constructed explicitly in @xcite , thanks to the known properties of jacobi elliptic functions related to the cubic nls equation .",
    "the task of the present work is to extend these results to the nls equation with the generalized power nonlinearity ( [ eq0 ] ) .",
    "our particular emphasis is on the existence and stability of standing localized waves bifurcating from the edge of the essential spectrum of @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to the previous work in @xcite , we prove the existence and bifurcation results without relying on the known exact solutions but using a modification of the lyapunov ",
    "schmidt reduction method .",
    "we also address the linear and orbital stability of the bifurcating standing waves near the bifurcation threshold , which was not considered in @xcite even in the case of cubic nonlinearities .    as is well - known ( see , e.g. , chapter 4 in @xcite for review ) , spectral and orbital stability of the stationary solutions in the time evolution of the nls equation ( [ eq0 ] )",
    "is determined by the spectra of the self - adjoint operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which defines the energy quadratic form near the stationary solution . in our context , the spectral problem for operator @xmath33 is defined by the boundary - value problem @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents any stationary solution of the boundary - value problem ( [ stat - nls ] ) . the spectral problem for operator @xmath32",
    "is defined by the boundary - value problem @xmath36 similarly to the operator @xmath5 , operators @xmath37 are self - adjoint in @xmath7 with the domain @xmath6 given in ( [ domain - delta ] ) .",
    "our main result is that a countable set of standing localized waves bifurcates from the end point of the essential spectrum of @xmath5 at @xmath38 .",
    "this bifurcation , known as _ the edge bifurcation _",
    ", was previously studied in the context of linear eigenvalue problems @xcite .",
    "primary branch _ of standing waves has no nodes and it bifurcates from the vanishing state .",
    "the subsequent families of standing waves , or _ higher branches _ , can be ordered according to the increasing number of nodes and each family bifurcates from one of the standing waves which are identically zero outside the ring @xmath17 .    for small @xmath39 and subcritical power nonlinearities with @xmath21",
    ", we show that the primary branch is composed by orbitally stable standing waves , whereas the higher branches with non - vanishing localized tails are spectrally unstable . the spectral analysis is inconclusive for the higher branches with the vanishing tail outside the ring .",
    "numerical analysis is developed for the cubic nls equation with @xmath31 to show linear instability of these higher branches near the bifurcation point @xmath38 and their spectral stability in the limit of large negative @xmath24 . at the same time , conclusions on the orbital stability of the standing waves along the primary branch and the spectral instability of the higher branches with nonvanishing localized tails remain true for all negative @xmath24 .",
    "we note that orbital stability of the nodeless primary branch supports the idea that it represents the ground state of the system , that is , it minimizes energy at constant mass , as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we prove existence of a countable set of standing waves which vanish on the tail of the tadpole graph .",
    "this set is the basis for the subsequent analysis of bifurcation and stability of new standing waves .    in section 3",
    "we show the existence of the primary branch of standing waves , which bifurcates from the trivial solution at @xmath40 . in section 4",
    "we construct the higher branches of standing waves , which bifurcate at @xmath40 from each solution in the countable set constructed in section 2 , the bifurcating solutions have non - vanishing localized tail outside the ring .",
    "note that both perturbative results are based on a non - trivial adaptation of the lyapunov ",
    "schmidt reduction method , which holds near the edge bifurcation .",
    "in section 5 we consider orbital stability of primary branch near the bifurcation point , using the general theory of grillakis - shatah - strauss @xcite and grillakis @xcite .",
    "we count multiplicities of the negative and zero eigenvalues of the linearized operators @xmath33 and @xmath32 and verify the slope condition , which indicates if the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath32 is reduced by one on an orthogonal complement of the eigenvector of @xmath33 .    in section 6",
    "we prove the linear instability of higher branches of standing waves with non - vanishing localized tails outside the ring .",
    "we note that the count of negative and zero eigenvalues of the linearized operators @xmath33 and @xmath32 is more difficult for the higher branches and it involves eigenvalue problems with nonlinear dependence of the spectral problem on the spectral parameter .",
    "we also show that the eigenvalue count is inconclusive for the higher branches with vanishing tails outside the ring . using heuristic arguments",
    ", we conjecture that these higher branches are also unstable at least for small values of @xmath24 .",
    "finally , in section 7 , we develop numerical approximations for the cubic case @xmath31 .",
    "numerical findings illustrate our analytical results near @xmath38 and give a complete picture on existence and stability of standing waves on the tadpole graphs for larger values of the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "we use the following notations throughout the paper :    * @xmath41 denotes the usual sobolev space of square integrable functions with square integrable second derivatives ; * @xmath42 denotes the space of @xmath43-times continuously differentiable functions with bounded derivatives up to the order @xmath43 ; * @xmath44 denotes a quantity that converges to zero at the same rate as @xmath45 as @xmath46 ; * @xmath47 denotes a quantity that converges to zero faster than @xmath45 as @xmath46 ; * primes always denote derivatives with respect to the spatial variable .",
    "here we consider standing waves of the stationary nls equation , which are identically zero on the tail of the tadpole graph .",
    "the decoupled stationary solutions with @xmath48 for all @xmath49 satisfy the nonlinear boundary value problem on the ring : @xmath50 although the boundary conditions over - determine the second - order boundary - value problem , we can look for odd @xmath51-periodic solutions in @xmath52 , which satisfy the dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath53 as well as at @xmath54 . for each solution with @xmath55 , we have also another solution with @xmath56 because both @xmath27 and @xmath57 satisfy the same boundary - value problem ( [ stat - nls - scalar ] ) .",
    "first , we characterize trajectories of the second - order differential equation in the system ( [ stat - nls - scalar ] ) on the phase plane @xmath58 . for any @xmath59 ,",

    "every @xmath61 , the period - to - energy map @xmath63 associated with the closed periodic trajectories that surrounds the zero critical point of the energy invariant ( [ energy - invariant ] ) is a @xmath64 diffeomorphism with @xmath65 [ lemma - period ]    by integrating the trajectory of the first - order equation ( [ energy - invariant ] ) from the point @xmath66 and @xmath67 to the point @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the positive root of the algebraic equation @xmath71 we obtain the explicit representation of the half period @xmath72 in terms of @xmath73 , @xmath74 substituting @xmath73 from ( [ period-1 ] ) and using the change of variables @xmath75 with @xmath76 , we rewrite ( [ period-2 ] ) in the equivalent form @xmath77 thus , @xmath73 and @xmath72 are parameterized by @xmath70 in equations ( [ period-1 ] ) and ( [ period-3 ] ) . for every @xmath61",
    ", we use these equations and obtain the asymptotic representations of @xmath73 and @xmath72 in the limits @xmath78 and @xmath79 , namely @xmath80 and @xmath81 where the integral returns a finite value and we have used the fact that @xmath82 is a simple root of both @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "now we show that the period - to - energy map ( [ map-1 ] ) is @xmath64 and satisfies ( [ period-4 ] ) .",
    "we use the chain rule , since the map @xmath85 is monotonically increasing for every @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we only need to show that the map @xmath86 is monotonically decreasing for every @xmath61 .",
    "this follows from the explicit computation , @xmath87 where the integral returns a finite value because again @xmath82 is a simple root of both @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
