    "the analysis of the spherical steady accretion of gas onto a gravitational center starts with the newtonian accretion discussed by bondi @xcite .",
    "michel @xcite , shapiro and teukolsky @xcite , and others @xcite investigated the accretion of test fluids in the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "recent analysis showing the importance of backreaction is that of karkowski et al .",
    "@xcite . in this lecture",
    "we follow the general - relativistic description of selfgravitating fluids that has been formulated in @xcite and present main results of @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for inspecting steady flows in the full generality , when infalling gas modifies the space - time geometry , is the wish to see the effects of backreaction in a simple but nontrivial accretion model .",
    "we show later , following @xcite , that the mass accretion rate @xmath0 behaves like @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ratio of the mass of the fluid to the total mass and @xmath3 is the mass accretion rate for the accretion of test fluids . since @xmath3 is proportional to the fluid abundance , hence to @xmath4 , one sees that there exists a maximum of @xmath0 when @xmath5 .",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath0 sets an upper limit for the luminosity of the system .",
    "this simple analysis of accretion suggests the existence of two weakly luminous regimes : one rich in fluid with @xmath6 and the other with a small amount of fluid , @xmath7 .",
    "it is clear from this reasoning that it is reasonable to take into account selfgravitation of accreting gases whenever their mass is comparable to the central mass . on the other hand",
    ", the stability properties of accreting fluids can depend on backreaction , however small .",
    "the stability of steady flows in a fixed relativistic background as well as in the newtonian context has been shown by moncrief @xcite .",
    "we show later that the steady newtonian acretion of selfgravitating gases does not exclude instability .",
    "trying to put matter in the astrophysical context , notice that one can expect the mass of accreting fluids to be comparable to the central mass only in the case of heavy and luminous compact objects ; compact galactic centers probably constitute fair examples .",
    "this suggests that the accretion physics of such objects should include the selfgravity of accreting matter .",
    "let us mention here that there exists a fundamental physical aspect that the astrophysics of accreting matter might be able to resolve .",
    "namely , the standard point of view is that compact objects of a mass exceeding several solar masses constitute black holes .",
    "that interpretation has been challenged by mazur and mottola @xcite who developed the notion of gravatars  stars almost as compact as black holes but dispossessed of event horizons .",
    "gravastars are supposed to be built from matter violating energy conditions @xcite and in this way they would avoid the standard compactness and mass limitations , like the buchdahl theorem @xcite or chandrasekhar type bounds on mass .",
    "there is an interesting motivation coming from the quantum - gravity type arguments , that inspired the concept of gravastars , but we leave it aside . it is disputable whether observations can distinguish compact bodies endowed with a hard surface from black holes within the known nowadays accretion models . for a discussion of that issue see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we believe that the resolution of that problem requires the inclusion of general - relativistic aspects such as backreaction . in this talk",
    "we shall report the recent progress in this direction .",
    "we will consider a spherically symmetric compact ball of a fluid falling onto a non - rotating black hole .",
    "the equations are taken from @xcite .",
    "we will use comoving coordinates @xmath8 where the lapse @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the areal radius @xmath11 are functions of a coordinate radius @xmath12 and an asymptotic time variable @xmath13 .",
    "the nonzero components of the extrinsic curvature @xmath14 of the @xmath15 slices read @xmath16 . here",
    "the mean curvature of two - spheres of constant radius @xmath12 , embedded in a cauchy hypersurface is @xmath18 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the perfect fluid reads @xmath19 ( where we assume the barotropic equation of state ) , @xmath20 with @xmath21 denoting the four - velocity of the fluid , @xmath22 is the pressure and @xmath23 the energy density in the comoving frame .",
    "the areal velocity @xmath24 of a comoving particle labelled by coordinates @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 . from the einstein constraint equations",
    "one has @xmath27 here and below we use @xmath28 in order to eliminate the differentiation with respect to the comoving radius @xmath12 .",
    "the quasilocal mass @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 .",
    "the mass accretion rate is @xmath31 or ( equivalently , but perhaps more familiarly ) @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the baryonic density .",
    "we assume a steady collapse of the fluid , which means that all its characteristics are constant at a fixed areal radius @xmath11 : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the speed of sound .",
    "strictly saying , a stationary accretion must lead to to the increase of the central mass and of some geometric quantities .",
    "this in turn means that the notion of the `` steady accretion '' is approximate  it demands that the mass accretion rate is small and the time scale is short , so that the quasilocal mass @xmath29 does not change significantly .",
    "thence also geometric quantities , like the mean curvature @xmath37 or the area of the black hole , remain practically constant .    the einstein evolution equation @xmath38 and the energy conservation equation @xmath39 constitute ( assuming steady flow ) ordinary differential equations with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "it is easy to show that now the mass accretion rate is constant , @xmath40 @xcite .    by a black hole",
    "is understood a region within an apparent horizon to the future , i.e. , a region enclosed by an outermost sphere @xmath41 on which the optical scalar @xmath42 vanishes @xcite .",
    "( the other condition , that @xmath43 for all spheres outside @xmath41 , is satisfied trivially for a steady accretion . ) that means that on @xmath41 the ratio @xmath44 becomes 1 , where @xmath45 is the areal radius of the apparent horizon and @xmath46 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "we assume the polytropic equation of state @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being a constant , ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the radius @xmath50 of the ball of fluid and other boundary data are such @xmath51 .",
    "these boundary conditions allow one to join smoothly the internal solution ( the steady fluid ) with the external schwarzschild geometry .",
    "the momentum conservation equation @xmath52  in comoving coordinates @xmath53  can be integrated , yielding ( with @xmath54 ) @xmath55 here @xmath56 .",
    "equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) is the general - relativistic version of the bernoulli equation .",
    "equation ( [ euler ] ) implies also that the lapse expresses as follows @xmath57 , with the baryonic number density @xmath58 the baryonic current is conserved , @xmath59 .",
    "the sonic point is as a location where the length of the spatial velocity vector @xmath60 equals @xmath61 .",
    "therefore @xmath62 . in the newtonian limit",
    "this coincides with the standard requirement @xmath63 . in the following",
    "we will denote by the asterisk all values referring to the sonic points , e.g. @xmath64 , @xmath65 , etc .",
    "the four characteristics , @xmath64 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are related @xcite , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "the infall velocity @xmath24 reads @xmath71 here @xmath66 is the negative square root . from the relation between the pressure and the energy density , one obtains , using equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) @xmath72 where the constant @xmath73 is equal to the mass density of a collapsing fluid at the boundary @xmath50 .",
    "the steady fluid is described by equations ( [ bernoulli ]  [ mr ] ) .",
    "they constitute an integro - algebraic system of equations , with a bifurcation point at the sonic point , where two branches ( identified as an accretion or a wind ) do cross ; that is a well known feature of that problem , present also in models with a test fluid @xcite  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "that requires some caution in doing numerics and a careful selection of the solution branch .",
    "notice that these equations are expressed exclusively in terms of quantities that are steady in the sense of the former definition .",
    "in numerical calculations it will be convenient to represent the mass @xmath29 in the form @xmath74 notice that @xmath75 . for a steady flow one",
    "obtains @xcite @xmath76 the full description of the steady accretion is given by equations ( [ p ] ) , ( [ mr ] ) , ( [ bernoulli ] ) , ( [ u ] ) and ( [ nb ] ) , which are equivalent to the former set of equations .    in the forthcoming part of the talk we shall describe main points of the derivation of the accretion mass rate , following the presentation of karkowski et al",
    ". @xcite .    in the first step ,",
    "one shows in @xcite , that outside the sonic horizon solutions of the equations with backreaction can be estimated by relevant solutions describing the stationary accretion of test fluids .",
    "we supplement the foregoing list of conditions by another , that the mass @xmath77 of the fluid outside the sonic horizon is of the order of the mass @xmath78 within the sonic horizon ; that allows one to show that the function @xmath79 appearing in equation ( [ nb ] ) is essentially 1 and @xmath80 can be ignored . as a consequence one",
    "infers that in the case of stationary accretion of selfgravitating fluids some characteristics of the sonic point  @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83  are the same as for the test fluid accretion , provided that asymptotic data @xmath84 and @xmath85 are identical @xcite . in particular , in both cases characteristics of the sonic point",
    "do not depend on the mass  either the total mass @xmath86 or the mass @xmath78 of the accretor .",
    "in the second step one shows that it is possible to estimate the energy density @xmath87 of a system with backreaction using information about solutions in the test fluid approximation .",
    "it is done in @xcite .",
    "we shall describe in a more detail how one obtains the desired form of estimates onto the energy density of test fluids .",
    "one starts with the estimate on the inverse of the lapse function @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is less than one ( and in fact strictly smaller than @xmath90 ) .",
    "it is easy to show , applying the method of differential inequalities , that @xmath91 . since @xmath92 ,",
    "one has @xmath93 .",
    "notice now that the lapse is an increasing function and @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "therefore one arrives at the inequality @xmath96 having that , one can derive a bound onto @xmath87 .",
    "one obtains , applying the inequality ( [ lapse1 ] ) , @xmath97 the lapse at the sonic point @xmath98 and @xmath99 ; thus a constant @xmath100 can be written as @xmath101 one can prove following bounds ( see equation ( 5.2 ) in @xcite ) @xmath102 this implies a series of estimates : i ) for @xmath103 one has @xmath104 ; ii ) in the range @xmath105 holds @xmath106 ; iii ) when @xmath107 and @xmath108 one obtains @xmath109 and @xmath110 , iv ) while for @xmath107 and @xmath111 it follows @xmath106 .",
    "now , if we demand that the sonic point is outside of an apparent horizon then @xmath112 and that implies @xmath113 . using this fact , one can derive bounds onto the constant @xmath114 .",
    "namely , in each of the above cases we have i ) @xmath115 ; ii ) @xmath116 ; iii ) @xmath107 and @xmath108 : @xmath117",
    "iv ) @xmath107 and @xmath111 : @xmath118 .    with these estimates one obtains simple bounds onto @xmath119 .",
    "we shall consider in more detail two of them corresponding to the cases i ) and iii ) .",
    "for @xmath120 equation ( [ r1 ] ) can be written , using the inequality @xmath121 and @xmath122 , as @xmath123 in the case iii ) one notices that @xmath124 .",
    "that leads to the estimate @xmath125 one can check the selfconsistency of the calculation  for instance that the function @xmath126 for @xmath95 .",
    "indeed , the exponent in the exponential funtion @xmath127 is of the order of @xmath128 .",
    "this latter expressions reads in the case i ) @xmath129 .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath130 one concludes that @xmath131 which in turn is clearly much smaller than @xmath132 .",
    "thus the exponent of @xmath133 is negligibly small for @xmath95 and @xmath134 as desired .",
    "a similar reasoning in the case iii ) leads to @xmath135 .",
    "now @xmath136 .",
    "it is easy to see , taking into account the boundary condition @xmath137 and @xmath138 , that the second term in @xmath139 is much smaller than 1 and therefore the expression @xmath140 is negligible small . thus again",
    "@xmath141 , where @xmath77 is the mass of fluid outside the sonic horizon ; therefore one again arrives at @xmath142 .    in the third step",
    "one shows  using the same reasoning as in the preceding paragraghs  that the mass @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is a constant .",
    "this is because the mass density changes moderately outside the sonic point , as shown by estimates ( [ r2]-[r3 ] ) .",
    "the calculation is lengthy but simple and we omit it here .",
    "taking into account @xmath145 , one infers @xmath146 ; the ratio @xmath147 linearly decreases with the growth of @xmath73 .",
    "the rate of the mass accretion @xmath0 can be expressed as below ( see equation ( 6.1 ) in @xcite ) @xmath148 the whole dependence on @xmath73 is contained in the factor @xmath149 .",
    "thus one can write @xmath150 this expression clearly demonstrates that the mass accretion rate achieves a maximum at @xmath151 and tends to zero when i ) @xmath152 ( when the density @xmath23 tends to zero ) and ii ) @xmath153 .",
    "thus , one concludes that * amongst steadily accreting systems of the same @xmath50 , @xmath154 and @xmath86 those will be most efficient for which @xmath151 . *",
    "the factor 2/3 is universal  independent of the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath48 and @xmath154 .",
    "since the mass of the fluid @xmath77 is close to @xmath155 and @xmath156 , the above means that the maximum of the mass accretion takes place when the mass of the fluid is a half of the mass of the black hole .",
    "finally let us mention that in the case of polytropes with @xmath157 the bernoulli equation reads @xmath158 .",
    "the analytic arguments of the type presented above can be applied and conclusions are the same .",
    "similar results should be true for massive fluids in the newtonian limit provided that the polytropic index @xmath159 is clearly smaller than @xmath160 .",
    "in this section we present a small sample of the numerical investigation , different from that shown in @xcite .",
    "the main lesson that one can infer from these is that boundary conditions displayed in sec .",
    "2 can be significantly weakened .",
    "it is clear from considerations around @xmath161 that the point where one can expect difficulties is when the adiabatic index @xmath162 , since in this case the relevant bounds are relatively poor .",
    "but the numerical data , that are displayed in the forthcoming table and figures , demonstrate suprisingly good agreement with the statements of the preceding section .",
    ".characteristics of the sonic point @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 for the @xmath166 polytrope and @xmath167 .",
    "the last column shows the areal radius of the apparent horizon .",
    "the mass accretion rate ( second column ) achieves maximum at @xmath168 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it appears that the characteristics @xmath163 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 of the sonic point _ practically _ do not depend , for a given @xmath48 and @xmath171 , on the energy density @xmath73 ( exemplary results are shown in table 1 ) , suggesting a precision of @xmath172 .",
    "the more reliable measure of the numerical error is the difference between the mass @xmath173 ( assumed in the equations ) and the mass found numerically .",
    "our results ( see table ) suggest that numerical error is smaller than 0.5 % .",
    "the quantity @xmath68 is negligible in comparison to other sonic point parameters .",
    "the mass @xmath174 behaves like @xmath175 ( fig .",
    "finally , the extremum of @xmath0 is achieved when @xmath176 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . notably , numerical results extend the regime in which the universality is observed into fluids characterized by the speed of sound @xmath154 exceeding 1 .",
    "this is remarkable , since that implies @xmath177 and the theoretical analysis presented above would not be valid .     on the asymptotic mass density.,width=302 ]     on the ratio @xmath178.,width=302 ]    formula ( [ dotm ] ) implies that the mass accretion rate in the case with backreaction ( when @xmath179 ) can be only smaller from the mass accretion rate without backreaction ( when @xmath180 ) , with the same asymptotic parameters @xmath181 , @xmath154 , @xmath86 .",
    "numerical results agree with the analytic conclusion that the proportionality coefficient @xmath144 depends essentially only on the size of support .",
    "the effect of selfgravitation of the steadily accreting gases on the stability has not been studied , up to our knowledge , even in the newtonian case . in this section",
    "we shall fill this gap by analyzing nonrelativistic accretion .",
    "the relativistic accretion will be done elsewhere .",
    "the forthcoming analysis holds true for polytropes and , more generally , for barotropes .",
    "the newtonian equations for selfgravitating fluids in terms of the eulerian time @xmath13 and the areal radius @xmath11 read @xmath182 the stability analysis of the bondi accretion in the lagrange formulation has been performed by balazs @xcite .",
    "his approach is correct but inconclusive , because of a too stringent understanding of the notion of linearized stability .",
    "we show that using lagrangian variables one exactly reproduces the stability result already known from the eulerian approach @xcite .    as the primary quantity one takes the deviation @xmath183 from the particle position in the unperturbed flow .",
    "the perturbed velocity reads @xmath184 ; here @xmath185 is the derivative with respect the lagrangian time .",
    "the lagrangian perturbation @xmath186 can be related to @xmath187 by demanding that @xmath188 ; that implies @xmath189    the @xmath190 solves eqs .",
    "( [ euler ] ) with the mass function @xmath29 including the contribution of the fluid itself .",
    "one derives from the first of eqs .",
    "( [ euler ] ) the equation ruling @xmath187 ( take notice during the derivation that @xmath191 ) @xmath192 the perturbation of the other equation in ( [ euler ] ) is satisfied identically .",
    "balazs tried to find solutions in the standard way , of the form @xmath193 with positive @xmath194 , that is with nonincreasing in time modulus ; this clearly can not be done , as shown below .",
    "the proper approach ( adopted in the eulerian variables by moncrief @xcite ) is to define an energy of perturbed modes by the expression @xmath195 where @xmath196 is an annulus between radii @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "the interesting and nontrivial question ( since the last integrand in ( [ energy11 ] ) can be negative in the vicinity of a sonic point ) is whether the energy @xmath199 of ( [ energy11 ] ) is positive .",
    "it is enough to consider the region outside of the sonic horizon , because perturbations that exist inside will be washed away to the black hole .    in order to answer that question , notice an identity @xmath200   + \\nonumber\\\\ & &   { 2\\varrho \\over a^2-u^2}\\left ( a^2 -{m\\over 2r}\\right)^2   -2\\pi r^2    \\varrho ; \\label{ident1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "notice the occurence of the negative term at the end of the formula . inserting ( [ ident1 ] ) into the last term in the integrand of ( [ energy11 ] ) and integrating by parts , one obtains after lengthy calculation that @xmath201^{r_\\infty } _",
    "{ r_\\ast }   \\label{energy12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath202 is not definite , while @xmath203 and @xmath204 are given by @xmath205 one can easily show that boundary terms of ( [ energy12 ] ) are nonnegative .",
    "the occurence of a negative term in ( [ energy13 ] ) means that the energy @xmath199 of modes perturbing the selfgravitating flow may be negative .",
    "the calculation of the derivative of the energy with respect to the eulerian time yields @xmath206^{r_\\infty } _ { r_\\ast } .",
    "\\label{flux1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a careful analysis of boundary terms shows that the contribution from @xmath198 and @xmath197 is negative definite .",
    "we can conclude that the outflow through the inner and outer boundaries is nonpositive and the energy @xmath199 of perturbations can not grow for the critical flow .",
    "despite this fact , there is a possibility for unstable behaviour of the solutions of the time - dependent hydrodynamic equations , because the energy @xmath199 is not positive definite .",
    "the situation for subsonic flows is unclear even for test fluids , as pointed by garlick @xcite . while the analysis at @xmath198 yields the same result , that the outflow diminishes the energy @xmath199 , one has to assume that the inner outflow is completely absorbed by the surface of an attracting body , that is @xmath207 , in order to conclude that @xmath208 . for more realistic cases , with the occurence of a reflection from the inner boundary , the energy of the perturbation may grow , signalling an instability , in addition to the `` bulk - type instability '' suggested by the above analysis .",
    "it is necessary to say in this place that the absence of exponentially growing linear modes does not mean that perturbed solutions of the nonlinear equation will be close to the background solution at all times . linearized stability of a solution would imply only that evolving perturbations can be bounded by initial perturbations in a suitable sense .",
    "the existence of exponential linear modes in turn does not necessarily yields that perturbations grow indefinitely .",
    "linear instability means that some evolving nonlinear perturbations are not bounded by initial perturbations ; the `` strength '' of evolving perturbations does not depend on the `` strength '' of initial pertrbations @xcite .    restricting our attention to test fluids , notice the following .",
    "the energy @xmath199 is equal to @xmath209 , and @xmath209 differs from the expression ( [ energy13 ] ) only by the absence of the last , nonpositive integral , hence it is clearly positive .",
    "the time propagation in turn is like in ( [ flux1 ] ) , but without the integral @xmath210 on the right hand side .",
    "thus @xmath199 can not grow , which excludes the exponential growth of @xmath203 and @xmath204 and the long - term exponential growth of linear modes @xmath187 .",
    "that does not guarantee that @xmath211 is time - independent .",
