    "our optimism to find in the lhc experiments some new dynamical effects at the @xmath4-scale is based , in particular , on the mssm features . as the simplest supersymmetric generalization of the sm ,",
    "the mssm provides not only uv stability of the higgs bosons mass spectrum at @xmath5 , but leads to unification of the gauge couplings at @xmath6 and contains an elegant interpretation of neutralinos as the main dm components . besides , and this is important , the mssm did nt contradict to known experimental data up to energies @xmath7 .",
    "then it s naturally to suggest that the mssm inevitably should make an evident of new dynamical effects and objects at the lhc  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the `` fine - tuning '' absence , which is called as `` naturalness '' of the mssm spectra , simultaneously with other features of the model , has led to the `` great desert '' existing between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . however , in the last time there appears certain reasons to have doubts about the singling out of the mssm energetic spectra .",
    "namely , in  @xcite there was formulated an assertion that the `` naturalness '' , as a way to avoid the `` fine - tuning '' , can be eliminated , in particular , in the framework of multi - vacua ideas from superstring theories .",
    "it leads to the split supersymmetry model where @xmath10 and all superscalar masses are much higher than @xmath11 except of higgs doublet , which is retained at the electro - weak ( ew ) scale .",
    "the gauge coupling unification as the most important feature of any reasonable susy model formulation  @xcite is conserved in the split supersymmetry at sufficiently high scale @xmath9 to provide the proton stability . a careful analysis of various aspects of such type models , where supersymmetry is split from the ew scale ,",
    "is considered in  @xcite .",
    "some experimental consequences of the split supersymmetry ideas are investigated in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "because of any inner dynamical reasons absence , only from the one - loop renormgroup analysis of the susy @xmath12 containing the mssm , there is the chance to populate `` the great desert '' with some intermediate scales  @xcite .",
    "the `` population '' allows to conserve the gauge couplings unification at @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the rg analysis , carried out in our work , has shown that there are just two possible variants .",
    "the first one is the light gaugino scenario that is well investigated early @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second one is the split light higgsino scenario , that is the object of our investigations .",
    "the split light higgsino scenario is a susy variant , where higgs bosons can be kept at @xmath11 scale , all color degrees of freedom should be much heavier than the electro - weak ones , unification of gauge couplings occurs at @xmath14 and protects the proton stability .",
    "the mass scales of all superpartners , except higgsino , lies in the region @xmath15 it is important that in the models with the split supersymmetry the higgsino mass can remain arbitrary and can be placed not far from the ew scale . in our paper",
    "some properties of this model that has a split supersymmetry structure are considered .",
    "obviously , models with split supersymmetry naturally lead to the damping of scalar quarks , leptons and gauginos contributions near ew scale .",
    "another important consequence of the light higgsino splitting is nearly degeneration in mass of neutralino and closest chargino @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( note , that experimental searches for the degeneration were carried out at lep energies  @xcite without any evident signals ) .",
    "the masses of the lowest states ( neutralinos and charginos ) and their interaction features are the key questions for the experimental data predictions and interpretation . all split supersymmetry models are `` unnatural '' , and we need in some additional sources of information about the susy with drifted to higher scales mass spectra .    as it was noted in  @xcite ,",
    "@xcite the dm nature is just one more `` link between new physics and ew scale '' . in the current work we have joined the split supersymmetry ideas with the assumption that dark matter has to be composed of neutralino as lsp .",
    "split light higgsino model leads to specific predictions on the lsp properties and , consequently , on the dm structure .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsp ) in this model have a structure of higgsino .",
    "we developed analysis of the residual neutralino concentration in the cosmological plasma .",
    "it is shown that formation of the dm concentration occurs in the high symmetric phase of the cosmological plasma .",
    "this fact allowed us to estimate the value of higgsino mass @xmath16 within an error following from experimental uncertainties in dm mass density determination .",
    "because of strong degeneration mass of chargino and neutralino in our model the detection them at the lhc will be impossible .",
    "so supersymmetry with the gap between higgsino states and higgs bosons , on one side , and scalar states and gauginos , on the other side , has some features that can be established in specific experiments only .",
    "due to particular properties of split light neutralino and important role of neutralino in the dm physics , we will see below that such investigations are possible at nusel  @xcite , where direct observations of galactic neutralino at underground detectors are planned , and at the satellite detector glast where there are the possibilities to catch some indirect signals from neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo .",
    "we have shown that the neutralino - nucleon cross section is spin - dependent .",
    "analysis of neutralino - chargino recharge on nucleons is presented .",
    "this effect can take place if neutralinos with kinetic energy @xmath17 are attending in the cosmic rays spectrum .",
    "the annihilation of galactic neutralinos occurs in @xmath18 and @xmath19 pairs in @xmath20- and @xmath21-channels , and also in lepton - antilepton and quark - antiquark pairs in the @xmath21-channel .",
    "the contribution to the annihilation spectrum from first two processes is calculated with using experimental data about hadron multiplicities at the mass surfaces of @xmath22-bosons ; the calculation of quark - antiquark @xmath21-channel contribution is based on the phenomenological model of hadron multiplicities at @xmath23 with using negative binomial distribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the one - loop renormalization group analysis of the susy @xmath12 containing the mssm is fulfilled and it is shown that there are just two possible variants of supersymmetry : the light gaugino scenario and the light ( split ) higgsino scenario . in section 3",
    "we have extracted from the theory some specific information about properties of lsp in the framework of light ( split ) higgsino scenario .",
    "the chargino and neutralino mass spectrum is dominated by radiation corrections .",
    "it is quasi - degenerated and calculable exactly without renormalization .",
    "section 4 devoted to studying of neutralino residual concentration and its evolution in the cosmological plasma .",
    "it is shown here that the formation of residual neutralino concentration occurs in the high symmetric phase of cosmological plasma . in section 5 the possibilities for direct and indirect searches of dark matter in the case of light ( split ) higgsino scenario",
    "are considered .",
    "section 6 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "standard and well known mssm is motivated by two arguments : 1 ) the used hierarchy of scales leads to convergence of all mssm couplings at some @xmath9 that is compatible with experimental restriction from the proton lifetime ; 2 ) the scale of susy breaking is not very high , @xmath24 , so quadratic divergencies are compensated near @xmath25 , i.e. long before @xmath9 . due to the first reason the mssm evidently can be built into gut theory and into supergravity / superstring theory . but the second argument seems not obligatory condition from the qft point of view  @xcite .",
    "exact convergence of running couplings takes place in the split higgsino scenario too .    in @xcite",
    "such convergence has been shown for the susy breaking scale lying in the intermediate supergauge region . in our renormgroup analysis",
    "all @xmath26 degrees of freedom despite of quark - lepton states are taken into consideration involving the states that are near @xmath9 . as we ll see their contributions are important for the choice of",
    "the susy scales hierarchy .    experimentally running couplings",
    "are fixed at @xmath27 scale : @xmath28 in renormgroup equations the following values are used as initial : @xmath29 known equations for running couplings at one - loop level are : @xmath30 in the sum all states with masses @xmath31 at @xmath32 are taken into account .",
    "it is specifically that extra states should be taken into account in these equations .",
    "namely , singlet quarks and their superpartners @xmath33 are contained in superhiggs quintets of @xmath26 , so they are in the model inevitably ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "besides chiral superfields @xmath34 and @xmath35 in adjoint representations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , survive from superhiggs 24-multiplet . in the minimal @xmath26 masses of the states",
    "@xmath38 are generated by interaction with higgs condensate at the gut scale , but the couplings of the interaction are phenomenological so they are not fixed . in this scenario",
    "we evidently assume that @xmath39 and , in principle , this inequality can be fulfilled with accuracy in 1  2 orders .",
    "thus , for one - loop running couplings at the scale @xmath40 we have : @xmath41 here @xmath42  masses of scalar quarks and leptons averaging in chiralities and generations ; @xmath43  @xmath20-quark mass ; other parameters were introduced above . in ( [ gut ] )",
    "it is supposed that @xmath44-boson mass lies near @xmath27 and other higgses @xmath45 are placed at the @xmath25 scale .",
    "note that singlet superstates and residual higgs superfields can be formally eliminated from ( [ gut ] ) , if their masses are equaled to @xmath9 identically .    at first step",
    "all couplings have been recalculated at @xmath46 scale , all the sm states contribute into running of couplings despite of @xmath47 , higgs bosons and @xmath20-quark . at the time terms with @xmath48",
    "occur , which are quantitatively important for the calculations",
    ". between @xmath49 scales the following states emerge : @xmath47 and one higgs doublet containing light @xmath50boson and longitudinal degrees of freedom of @xmath47 . at these stages",
    "@xmath51 vertex was used for calculations of @xmath52 . above the @xmath53 scale calculations were carried out in a standard manner .",
    "it is important that equations ( [ gut ] ) do not depend on specific arrangement of @xmath54 degrees of freedom at energetic scales .",
    "now , equaling couplings at @xmath9 , from ( [ gut ] ) we get following expressions : @xmath55 where @xmath56    @xmath57    here all parameters @xmath58 with various indexes are defined as quantities having values more than unity . note that @xmath59 are not under the theoretical control neither in the mssm nor in the @xmath26 .",
    "so we assume that @xmath60 .",
    "there is an experimental restriction for heavy higgs bosons @xcite : @xmath61 .",
    "it leads to following variation of @xmath62 : @xmath63 .",
    "values of @xmath64 are determined from renormgroup evolution from @xmath9 to @xmath65 . here",
    "we suppose that @xmath66 .",
    "there were analyzed @xmath67 and @xmath1 depending on @xmath9 : @xmath68    we used known restrictions for the proton lifetime @xmath69 at @xmath70 and for @xmath8 @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "two variants  with @xmath73 or @xmath74  were found from analysis of ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "they are shown at fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .    =    refusing the `` supergauge desert ''",
    "idea , nevertheless we have a possibility to evaluate separated higgsino mass accepting the hypothesis that neutralino is a carrier of the dm .",
    "as it is known , after the ew symmetry breaking supersymmetric partners of higgs and electroweak gauge fields forms two dirac electrically charged particles  charginos @xmath75 , and four majorana electrically neutral particles ",
    "neutralinos @xmath76 lightest supersymmetric particle @xmath77 is main candidate to be the cold dark matter component @xcite , @xcite .",

    "one has shown that only two variant of mssm are theoretically natural .",
    "first variant  the light gaugino scenario ( bino or wino or their mixture ) , in which @xmath82  is well investigated early @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "now we consider the second alternative variant of mssm , in which the higgsino mass scale is the nearest for ew scale , but @xmath8 is in the multi - tev region ",
    "so - called light ( split ) higgsino scenario ( this model obviously possesses a split supersymmetry property ) , where @xmath83 in this model light states @xmath84 and @xmath85 have ( almost pure ) higgsino structure with masses @xmath86 heavier states @xmath87 and @xmath88 lie near @xmath8 : @xmath89    then all processes near ew scale are described by the sm lagrangian together with extra lagrangian of light higgsinos interactions with photons and vector bosons : @xmath90 here neutralinos are 4-component majorana spinors .    if @xmath91 the radiation corrections begin to dominate in the chargino and neutralino masses formation .",

    "in discussing versus of the theory physics of neutral and charged higgsinos fixes by the lagrangian ( [ lh ] ) and the mass spectrum ( [ h ] ) with the radiation splitting ( [ delta ] ) .",

    "pairs practically occur through non - neutrino channels , so consequently neutrino evolution in cosmological plasma can be considered adiabatically .",
    "therefore , scale factors ratio in ( [ nchi1 ] ) can be replaced by the ratio of neutrino gas temperatures : @xmath120 here @xmath121 stands for universe age , @xmath122 , @xmath123  the gamma relic temperature .",
    "finally , for the epoch when relic neutrino temperature is @xmath124 , for stable neutralinos density we get : @xmath125    from the recent wmap data @xcite , @xcite in the modern universe the dm mass density is : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the critical density for the universe . assuming the dm consists of neutralinos only , we have equality : @xmath128    to estimate the value of @xmath96 from ( [ ysl ] ) annihilation kinetic cross section @xmath108 vs. @xmath96 should be obtained .",
    "but it does nt known at which phase of cosmological plasma the irreversible neutralino annihilation occurs , so we need in two possible scenarios analysis .    *",
    "neutralino annihilation : low - symmetric phase .",
    "*    if neutralino mass @xmath129 its relic abundance is formed after the ew transition , in low - symmetric ( ls ) phase of cosmological plasma . in standard scenarios majorana neutralinos , which are nearly gauginos ( [ gaugino ] ) , annihilate into ( nearly ) massless fermions and annihilation cross section depends on the temperature essentially . in the model under consideration neutralinos ca nt annihilate into fermions , so the cross section does nt depend on the temperature with a good accuracy .",
    "there are two formal scenarios : annihilation of short - lived particles ( @xmath130 ) and coannihilation of long - lived particles with ( @xmath131 ) @xcite . from our analysis it follows that variant with light split chargino and majorana neutralinos exists only when s - channel annihilation is forbidden . in other words second neutralino state @xmath132 could be unstable with the lifetime smaller than @xmath133 .",
    "this is possible if @xmath134 only .",
    "however this scenario leads to the necessity of a neutralino mass to the fine tuning near @xmath135 . at the same time it results to : @xmath136 that contradicts to the known experimental data @xcite . formally in the ls phase there is a second solution , which corresponds to @xmath137 but it is incompatible with the ls - phase neutralino annihilation .",
    "thus , we havent a self - consistent results for split neutralino annihilation in the ls phase .    *",
    "neutralino annihilation : high - symmetric phase .",
    "*    as it is known for temperatures @xmath138 where @xmath139 stands for the electro - weak phase transition temperature , cosmological plasma is in the high - symmetric phase ( hs ) and the plasma does nt contain any higgs condensate .",
    "a special feature of this phase is that all particles excepting higgsinos are massless ( more exactly , their masses @xmath140 ) . in hs - phase",
    "all physical states are presented by chiral fermions and gauge fields @xmath141 quanta . due to higgs condensate absence neutralino and chargino degrees of freedom",
    "join into the fundamental @xmath36 representation , i.e. dirac field @xmath142 .",
    "all states of the field are dynamically equivalent and correspond to restored @xmath36 symmetry quantum numbers .",
    "thus , instead of ( [ lh ] ) it should be used following lagrangian : @xmath143 which is added to the sm lagrangian written in terms of gauge and chiral fields : @xmath144 here corresponding flavour and family sums are suspected in all above terms .",
    "when @xmath145 irreversible neutralino annihilation is governed by lagrangians ( [ lh1 ] ) and ( [ lsm1 ] ) and occurs in the hs - phase . in t- and",
    "s - channels all cross section of higgsino annihilation into gauge bosons and massless fermions were calculated analogously to qcd calculation technology .",
    "the only difference is in the fact that it is necessary to consider all channels with initial and final states , which have an arbitrary color in two dimensions  it corresponds to the restored su(2 ) .",
    "the full list of all considered channels is following : @xmath146     annihilation channels in the high - symmetric phase.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    where @xmath147 are chiral quarks and leptons of three generations .",
    "for total kinetic annihilation cross section we find : @xmath148 here @xmath149 are gauge couplings at the scale @xmath150 . assuming that the relic is formed in the hs - phase , from theoretical expression ( [ dm ] ) and experimental data ( [ dmexp ] ) we get that the dm can be made from split neutralinos",
    "if they have the mass @xmath151 then the irreversible neutralino annihilation starts at the temperature @xmath152 and finishes at @xmath153 .",
    "thus , annihilation process occurs in the hs - phase only and it shows that the above neutralino mass estimation is self - consistent .",
    "evidently , the value ( [ mchi ] ) should be treated very carefully because of the dm content is really unknown . moreover , for this estimation an inequality @xmath154 should be correct . in any case",

    "neutralino - nucleon elastic scattering should be considered .",
    "it is known that the spin - independent component of the total cross section is due to neutralino - quark interaction by means of scalar quarks exchange @xcite . in the considered scenario",
    "this component is strongly damped by large scalar quark masses . as a result",
    "there is spin - dependent component of the total cross section only : @xmath156 for the elastic scattering off nuclei result is @xcite : @xmath157 here @xmath158 are wimp - proton ( neutron ) couplings .",

    "the model considered ( split higgsino scenario ) has peculiarity that is inherent in the sm extensions having of the split mass spectra : higgsino mass scale is considerably lower than the soft susy breaking scale : @xmath221 .    in this model , as in the standard mssm , there is the precise convergence of invariant couplings , the scale of convergence @xmath9 does nt contradict to the well known restriction on the proton lifetime .",

    "such heavy neutralinos , being of the dm carriers , should annihilate in the high - symmetric phase forming the relic .",
    "charged higgsino lifetime in the model is @xmath224 these results and peculiarities are inevitable because of hierarchy of the model scales and discriminate the model considered from other models possessing of the split supersymmetry property .",
    "these physical consequences of the model can be verified , in principle , in some experiments planned at underground laboratory nusel or satellite detector glast .",
    "namely , at nusel it is possible to search relic split heavy higgsino . due to the fact that spin dependent",

    "contributions to the gamma ray spectrum from t- and s - channels annihilation into @xmath18 and @xmath19 pairs were calculated with the using of experimental data on hadron multiplicities on @xmath226 mass shell ; for quark - antiquark s - channel contribution phenomenological model of hadron multiplicity at @xmath23 was used too .",
    "thus , it has been shown some other possibility of the @xmath8 scale shift to far energy region  in comparison with the known split supersymmetry variant .",
    "this splitting of the mass spectrum is a consequence of the extra supergauge symmetries existing at intermediate scales , between the sm and gut .",
