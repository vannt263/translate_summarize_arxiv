    "inflation , e.g. see @xcite , is the most prevailing scenario for early universe since it first provides an solution for the horizon , flatness and entropy problems of sbb .",
    "while the most important success of inflation is it suggests a causal generation mechanism for the superhorizon , adiabatic , scale invariant density perturbation .",
    "however , the causal generation of primordial perturbation can also be implemented in the case with the decaying speed of sound @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and also @xcite for contracting phase . during an earlier period of universe ,",
    "when the sound speed was decaying , the sound horizon contracted , thus the causal perturbation initially deep into the sound horizon can emerge and be stretched to the super sound horizon scale , and become the primordial perturbation responsible for structure formation at late time .",
    "in such a case , in principle , inflation may not be required at least for the generation of primordial perturbation .",
    "the modification of sound speed actually corresponds to the modification of dispersion relation .",
    "the cosmological applications of modified dispersion relation have been studied , which include trans - planckian physics @xcite , noncommutative field approach noncom , loop quantum gravity @xcite , lorentz - violating models lv .",
    "recently , a candidate for quantum gravity , dubbed hoava - liftshitz ( hl ) gravity @xcite , has been studied intensively .",
    "this theory has an action that is power counting renormalizable with respect to a scaling symmetry which treats space and time differently . in the ir region",
    ", this theory naturally flows to general relativity .",
    "the black hole solutions in hoava gravity were studied in horavabh,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the cosmological solutions was first addressed in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it was found that the early universe in hl cosmology may be able to escape singularity and has a nonsingular bounce .",
    "this might give an alternative to inflation , as has been discussed in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "there has been many detailed analysis for the theory of cosmological perturbations in hl cosmology @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and also @xcite,@xcite for gravitational wave . in @xcite",
    ", it was argued in uv regime of hl gravity which has a critical exponent @xmath3 , the spectrum of primordial perturbation induced by a scalar field may be scale invariant for any power law expansion with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this was subsequently confirmed by solving the motion equation of perturbation mode on super sound horizon scale for any background evolution of early universe @xcite . in @xcite , not only how the primordial perturbation generated in uv regime is matched to the observations on large ir scale was illustrated , but also the dependence of spectral index on any @xmath1 and @xmath6 was showed , in addition , it was also pointed out that the case of @xmath7 for the generation of scale invariant spectrum actually corresponds to that in contracting phase .",
    "there are also many studies on other aspects of hl cosmology @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and other relevant issues @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and some challenges @xcite,@xcite .    in this paper , inspired by the investigations on the theory of cosmological perturbations in hl cosmology",
    ", we will study the spectrum of primordial perturbation induced by a scalar field with modified dispersion relation @xmath8 , in which @xmath1 is the critical exponent . a specific case of our work with @xmath9",
    "have been studied in @xcite .",
    "we will generalize the calculations of @xcite to the case with arbitary @xmath2 and then give our discussion on the scale invariance of spectrum .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we will calculate the spectrum of primordial perturbation leaded by a scalar field with modified dispersion relation @xmath8 .",
    "in sec.3 we will discuss that for @xmath1 ranged from 1 to 4 , if the spectrum is required to be scale invariant , what should the value of @xmath2 be .",
    "we will depict the parameter space that guarantees scale invariant spectrum .",
    "the final is our conclusion .",
    "we will briefly calculate the primordial perturbation induced by a scalar field with modified dispersion relation @xmath10 . in the momentum space ,",
    "the motion equation of perturbation of scalar field @xmath11 is given by u_k^ + ( ^2-a^a ) u_k = 0 , [ equ]where @xmath12 is related to the perturbation @xmath13 of @xmath11 by @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are mode annihilation and generation operators . and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath17 .",
    "we can define @xmath18 for following discussions . here",
    ", @xmath19 is taken as = k^za^p-1m^z-1 .",
    "[ omega]when @xmath9 , the case is same as that studied in @xcite .",
    "however , here we will regard @xmath2 as arbitrary value , which may be equal to @xmath1 and may be not .",
    "recently , in the studies on the theory of cosmological perturbations in hl cosmology , e.g.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , it has been found that there are such some terms , which might imply that the factor before @xmath20 has a dependence on the time , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "this actually can be rewritten as ( [ omega ] ) , since @xmath22 is the function of @xmath17 .",
    "it is this observation that motivates our study .",
    "the calculations of perturbation spectrum is actually a generalization of that in @xcite . in term of ( [ omega ] ) , the sound speed is given by @xmath23 and the sound horizon is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the hubble parameter . in this case ,",
    "how the primordial perturbation generated in uv regime of hl gravity is matched to the observations on large ir scale has been illustrated in e.g. fig.1 of @xcite .",
    "we assume that initially all modes of fluctuation starts in their vacuum state .",
    "but in order to define vacuum in analogy with that in flat spacetime , adiabatic condition should be admitted .",
    "we need @xmath26 change quite small during one period @xmath27 of oscillation , i.e .",
    "@xmath28 . in this case",
    ", the mode function is approximatelly that in minkovsky spacetime , @xmath29 notice @xmath30 here , since we need @xmath31(equivalent to adiabatic condition ) to validate the approximation , i.e. the perturbation mode is deep into sound horizon .",
    "however , what we concern is that with @xmath32 , i.e. on super sound horizon scale , which is directly related with our observation",
    ". this can be obtained by solving eq.([equ ] ) with the initial condition ( [ adiabatic ] ) , as has been done in the calculations of inflationary perturbation .",
    "we take a power law evolving background @xmath33 for study , where @xmath6 is assumed to be positive real constant , and @xmath34 is regarded as a reference time and the corresponding scale factor is @xmath35 . in conformal time , @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "eq.([equ ] ) can be reduced to bessel equation .",
    "thus with the initial condition ( [ adiabatic ] ) , its solution is @xmath38where @xmath39 is the first kind of hankel function with order v=0.5|3n-1np-1| .",
    "[ v]first we will check the time dependence of mode amplitude in different cases .",
    "when @xmath40 at late time , @xmath41 is given .",
    "thus in term of definition , vacuum expectation @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "thus dependent on the sign of @xmath45 , @xmath46 evolves in 2 different cases .",
    "we can see that @xmath47 when @xmath48 . in this case , @xmath46 is constant on super horizon scale , which corresponds to the constant mode . while @xmath49 , @xmath50 . in this case , the amplitude will change with time , which can be increasing or decaying , dependent on different background evolution . for example , if @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 increases in contracting phase and decays in expansion phase , thus @xmath54 increases in contracting phase and decrease in expansion phase , since @xmath17 runs initially from @xmath55 to @xmath56 in the expanding phase with @xmath51 , whereas in contracting phase @xmath17 runs initially from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "the various cases are listed in the table .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in next section , it will be showed that @xmath59 in expanding phase and @xmath60 in contracting phase are required for the emergence of primordial perturbation , i.e. initially the perturbation mode is deep into the sound horizon , and then is stretched to the super sound horizon scale .",
    "this condition together with @xmath61 or @xmath62 will prohibit some possibilities .",
    "for example , since @xmath61 , if @xmath63 , then @xmath64 , in this case only the contracting phase is possible , while the decaying solution in the expanding phase is prohibited since the perturbation can not emerge in the expanding phase with @xmath60 .",
    "the perturbation spectrum is given by @xmath65where the constant @xmath66 is @xmath67 ^{2v-1}\\left ( \\frac{n}{1-n}\\right ) ^{\\frac{% 2n-2npv+2nv}{1-n}}\\ ] ] and @xmath68 has set as 1 and @xmath69 denotes the hubble scale at the end of perturbation generation period .",
    "we can see that for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , i.e. the scalar field with normal dispersion relation during inflation , @xmath72 can be obtained , since @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which is consistent with well known result . for @xmath75 , we have @xmath73 , @xmath76 and @xmath74 , thus @xmath77 , which is consistent with that obtained in @xcite,@xcite . the spectral index @xmath78 is @xmath79when @xmath80 , ( [ ns ] ) will reproduce the result obtained with normal dispersion relation , i.e. the spectrum is scale invariant only when @xmath71(inflation ) or @xmath81(contraction with @xmath82 ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . while when @xmath9 , the result in @xcite is recover , in which the parameter space of scale invariance of spectrum is studied in details .",
    "however , here since @xmath2 can be generally not equal to @xmath1 , it can be expected that the parameter space for scale invariance could be enlarge , i.e. there can be more possibilities to obtain the scale invariant spectrum , which will be investigated fully in the following section .",
    "in general , the fluctuations of field can only seed primordial perturbations inside hubble radius , otherwise no stable vacuum of @xmath83 can be defined .",
    "the generation of an adiabatic , gaussian and scale invariant spectrum of superhubble perturbations can not happen in any period of standard big bang .",
    "it is generally argued that only during a period of accelerated expansion , in which @xmath84 grows faster then @xmath85 , can subhubble modes being stretched to become superhubble modes . in this case fluctuations can be generated when they were subhubble and become superhubble during inflation .",
    "however , in the general cases with a modified dispersion relation , the argument should be changed as follows .",
    "the adiabatic condition for eq.([equ ] ) is @xmath86 , which is satisfied when @xmath87 , since in this case @xmath88 and @xmath89 is equivalent to @xmath87 . because @xmath90 , we conclude that @xmath91 is needed for the existence of adiabatic vacuum .",
    "this result can be viewed in 2 perspectives .",
    "the first one is to define an effective wavelength as @xmath92 .",
    "the initial condition @xmath93 corresponds the effective wavelength deep inside the hubble horizon at the beginning @xmath94 .",
    "the second one is to define a sound horizon as @xmath95 , in which @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath91 means the physical wavelength @xmath97 is much smaller than the sound horizon @xmath95 , thus a casual relationship can be established on super horizon scale .",
    "the details of this argument can be found in @xcite .",
    "the next step is to analysis the subsequent evolution of @xmath98 once initial requirement is satisfied . in power law expansion or contracting @xmath99 universe",
    ", @xmath100 is defined to be big bang singularity .",
    "we have @xmath101 , @xmath59 is required to guarantee @xmath102 .",
    "what follows is @xmath98 decreases monopoly to much smaller than @xmath103 , and this means corresponding mode leaves the sound horizon .",
    "otherwise , the requirement that physical wavelength should be deep inside the sound horizon in the early universe can not be assured .",
    "but what if we have another explanation for ` early universe ' ?",
    "even if @xmath104 in the vicinity of big bang , there are still possibility that during a power law contracting phase , our universe starts with @xmath105 and @xmath106 quite big , thus @xmath107 if @xmath108",
    ". this scenario can also make sure adiabatic approximation satisfied and @xmath98 decreases in the contracting phase , the physical wavelength stretched to super hubble scale , seed the energy density perturbation once it reenters the hubble radius",
    ". thus the emergence of primordial perturbation can be reduced to the criteria @xmath109    in term of eq.([ns ] ) , the possibilities of the scale invariant spectrum for fixed @xmath1 are listed in table.(roman1 ) .",
    "we set the shaded region as the case a , which satisfies @xmath110 , while the white region as case b , which satisfies @xmath111 .",
    "we take @xmath70 as a simple example for analysis . in order to get scale invariant primordial perturbation in an expanding phase",
    ", @xmath112 is required at first .",
    "when @xmath113 , then in case a , the result with normal dispersion relation is recovered , i.e. scale invariance only for @xmath71 . we can conclude that accelerated expansion is need if @xmath70 and @xmath113 , this is just inflation . in case b , the scale invariant spectrum can also be obtained when @xmath81 , which corresponds to a period dominated by matter , while @xmath60 means this period must be a contracting phase , according to ( [ np ] ) .",
    "there is another interesting example , i.e. the case with @xmath3 and @xmath114 . in this case , @xmath115 for any value of @xmath6 .",
    "this means no matter how background evolves , scale invariant spectrum can be generated .",
    "we can check case b , and find that the solution @xmath116 and @xmath114 lies in curve @xmath117 which is prohibited , since the points in this curve corresponds to condition that @xmath118 remains constant , and thus fails to cross the sound horizon .    in general ,",
    "if @xmath119 , it is impossible to have scale invariant spectrum for arbitrary @xmath6 , as has been studied in previous works .",
    "however , from table.(roman1 ) , we can see that when @xmath120 , it is possible to have scale invariant spectrum with any value of @xmath6 , as long as @xmath2 and @xmath6 satisfy certain constraint .",
    "for example , for @xmath121 , it can be found that when @xmath122 , which occurs for the expansion or contraction with case a , or @xmath123 , which occurs for the expansion or contraction with case b , the spectrum is scale invariant .",
    "this means that if @xmath81 , i.e. the phase dominated by matter , the scale invariance will be obtained in the expansion with @xmath124 or the contraction with @xmath125 .",
    "thus if @xmath126 , we can have scale invariant spectrum for the expansion with @xmath127 or the contraction with @xmath128 .",
    "this result might be interesting for the studies on the theory of cosmological perturbations in hl cosmology .",
    "in general , it can be showed that if the detailed balance condition is required , the term with @xmath129 in the equation of perturbation mode , like eq.([equ ] ) , exactly cancels , while the term with @xmath130 actually dominates , e.g.@xcite .",
    "however , it seems there is a time dependence in the @xmath131 term .",
    "we show that whether the spectrum is actually scale invariant is determined by this time dependence , and there can always be room for the generation of scale invariant spectrum .    the parameter space for scale invariance",
    "can also be represented in fig.1 and 2 .",
    "the corresponding curves of ` valid parameter ' is plotted in fig.1 for case a and in fig.2 for case b. the black line @xmath132 divide the parameter space into 2 regions .",
    "the pink region denotes those for contracting phases , while the uncolored region denotes those for expanding phases .",
    "in this paper , the spectrum of primordial perturbation induced by a scalar field with modified dispersion relation @xmath10 is studied , in which @xmath1 is the critical exponent .",
    "we generalize the calculations of @xcite , in which @xmath9 , to the case with arbitrary @xmath2 and show the general result for scale invariant spectrum .",
    "we find that when @xmath120 , there is always a room of parameters for the generation of scale invariant spectrum whenever @xmath6 and @xmath1 are .",
    "it should be pointed out that here what we concern is only how the primordial perturbation can emerge and be scale invariant , and whether other problems of standard cosmology can be solve simultaneously still needs to be analysed .",
    "however , this work can be interesting for further studies on hl cosmology .",
