    "the equilibrium problem ( ep ) @xcite which was considered as the ky fan inequality @xcite is very general in the sense that it includes , as special cases , many mathematical models such as : variational inequalities , fixed point problems , optimization problems , nash equilirium point problems , complementarity problems , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "many methods have been proposed for solving eps @xcite .",
    "the most solution approximations to eps are often based on the resolvent of equilibrium bifunction ( see , for instance @xcite ) in which a strongly monotone regularization equilibrium problem ( rep ) is solved at each iterative step .",
    "it is also called the proximal point method ( ppm ) .",
    "this method was first introduced by martinet @xcite for variational inequalities , and then it was extended by rockafellar @xcite for finding a zero point of a monotone operator . in 2000 , konnov @xcite further extended ppm to ky fan inequalities for monotone or weakly monotone bifunctions .    a special case of ep is the variational inequality problem ( vip ) .",
    "the projection plays an important role in constrained optimization problems .",
    "the simplest method for vips is the gradient projection method in which only a projection on the feasible set is computed .",
    "however , in order to obtain the convergence , the method requires the restrictive assumption that operators are strongly ( or inverse strongly ) monotone .",
    "to overcome this , korpelevich @xcite introduced the extragradient method ( double projection method ) where two metric projections onto the feasible set be implemented at each iteration .",
    "the convergence of the extragradient method was proved under the weaker assumption that operators are only monotone ( even , pseudomonotone ) and @xmath1 - lipschitz continuous . some extragradient - like algorithms proposed for solving vips",
    "can be found in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however , the projection is only found easily if the constrained set has a simple structure , for instance , as balls , hyperplanes or halfspaces .",
    "so , several modifications of the extragradient method have been proposed in various ways @xcite .",
    "for instance , the authors in @xcite replaced the second projection onto the feasible set in the extragradient method by one onto a half - space and proposed the subgradient extragradient method for vips in hilbert spaces .",
    "in recent years , korpelevich s extragradient method has been naturally extended to eps for monotone ( more general , pseudomonotone ) and lipschitz - type continuous bifunctions and widely studied both theoretically and algorithmically @xcite . in the extended extragradient methods to eps",
    ", we need to solve two strongly convex optimization programs on a closed convex constrained set ( see , algorithms [ vsh2013a ] , [ vsh2013b ] and [ dhm2014 ] in section [ algor ] ) .",
    "they are generalizations of two projections in korpelevich s extragradient method .",
    "the advantage of the extragradient method is that two optimization programs are solved at each iteration which seems to be numerically easier than the non - linear inequality ( or rep ) in ppm .",
    "however , this might still be costly and affects the efficiency of the used method if the structure of feasible set and equilibrium bifunction are complex",

    ", we have proposed a new hybrid algorithm for solving eps . in this algorithm , by constructing a specially cutting - halfspace in the hybrid method , we only need to solve a strongly convex optimization program onto the feasible set at each iteration .",
    "the absence of an optimization program in our algorithm ( compare with the extragradient method ) can be considered an improvement of the results in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section @xmath2 introduce our algorithm and some related works . in section @xmath3 , we collect some definitions and preliminary results used in the paper . section @xmath4 deals with proving the convergence of the algorithm .",
    "some applications of our algorithm to gato differentiable eps and multivalued variational inequalities are presented in section [ appl ] . finally , in section @xmath5 we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and compare it with others .",

    "the paper proposes a novel algorithm for solving eps for a class of pseudomonotone and lipschitz - type continuous bifunctions . by constructing the specially cutting halfspaces ,",
    "we have designed the algorithm without the extra - steps .",
    "this is the reason which explains why our algorithm can be considered as an improvement of some previously known algorithms . the strong convergence of the algorithm is proved and its efficiency is illustrated by some numerical experiments .",
    "it is also emphasized that we still have to solve exactly an optimization problem in each step .",
    "this , in general , is a disadvantage of the algorithm ( also , of the extragradient methods and the armijo linesearch methods ) when equilibrium bifunctions and feasible sets have complex structures .",
    "however , contrary to several previous algorithms , our algorithm does not only avoid using the extra - steps which , in general , are inherently costly but also is numerically easer at its last step because the projection is only performed onto the intersection of two half - spaces .",
    "the paper also help us in the design and analysis of more practical algorithms to be seen .",
    "finally , it seems to be that the algorithm also has competitive advantage .",
