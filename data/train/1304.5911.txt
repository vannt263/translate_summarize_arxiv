    "the vinnicombe @xmath2-metric introduced in @xcite and its abstract version given in @xcite both rely on finding _ normalized _ coprime factorizations .",
    "this is a troublesome aspect of the theory , since    1 .",
    "although merely coprime factorizations may exist , a _",
    "normalized _ coprime factorization may fail to exist : for example in the article @xcite by sergei treil , it was shown that the set of plants in the field of fractions of the disk algebra possessing normalized coprime factorizations is strictly contained in the set of plants possessing coprime factorizations .",
    "2 .   even if they exist , normalized coprime factorizations might be impossible to find using a constructive procedure : for example , in the paper @xcite by jonathan partington and gregory sankaran , it is shown that in the case of delay systems , in general the relevant spectral factorizations for finding normalized coprime factorizations can not be determined by solving any finite system of polynomial equations over the field @xmath3 .",
    "the goal in this paper is to show that this problematic feature of the @xmath2-metric can be eliminated , at least in the case of single input single output systems , by redefining the @xmath2-metric , which relies only on coprime factorizations , rather than _",
    "normalized _ coprime factorizations .",
    "the starting point is the generalized chordal distance @xmath1 introduced in @xcite given in terms of coprime factorizations , and then considering a refinement @xmath0 of this chordal distance akin to the @xmath2-metric @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that the metric @xmath0 coincides with the @xmath2-metric if one has normalized coprime factorizations at hand .",
    "but since our metric is in fact only defined using coprime factorizations , the burden of working with normalized coprime factorizations is completely eliminated .",
    "our main results are then that @xmath0 defines a metric on the set of all elements admitting a coprime factorization , and stabilizability is a robust property of the plant .",
    "the precise statements of the results are given in theorems  [ thm_main_1 ] and [ thm_main_2 ] , after the notation has been introduced in the next section .",
    "let us recall that in the `` factorization approach '' to linear control theory , one starts with an integral domain @xmath5 , which is thought to constitute the set of all transfer functions of _ stable _ linear systems .",
    "transfer functions of linear systems which are not necessarily stable are then taken to be elements of the field of fractions @xmath6 over @xmath5 .",
    "based on algebraic factorizations of the plant transfer function , control theoretic problems can then be posed and solved .",
    "we refer the uninitiated reader to the monograph by @xcite .",
    "this factorization approach to linear control theory has been resurrected and extended in the articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . in particular , in @xcite , @xcite , a theory of solving the stabilization problem ( recalled below ) is developed , which does not rely on the existence of coprime factorizations , but instead proceeds under weaker notions of coprimeness .",
    "this theme is also present in @xcite , with further emphasis on obtaining stabilizing controllers that are `` real symmetric '' ( and hence physically implementable ) given real symmetric data .",
    "our concern in this article is not with the stabilization problem , but rather the _ robust _ stabilization problem . before recalling the robust stabilization problem ,",
    "let us first remind ourselves of the stabilization problem .",
    "the _ stabilization problem _ is the following : given @xmath7 ( and unstable plant ) , find @xmath8 ( a stabilizing controller ) such that the `` interconnection '' of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is stable , that is , the closed loop transfer function is stable : @xmath11\\in r^{2\\times 2}.\\ ] ] it is well known that this problem can be solved if @xmath9 has a `` coprime factorization '' @xcite .    in reality , the plant transfer function is computed from the differential equation model of the situation at hand , which in turn is obtained from a modelling procedure involving idealizations , simplifying assumptions , approximations , and measurement of parameters .",
    "this means that the plant transfer function is not known precisely , but serves only as an approximation of reality .",
    "hence engineers imagine that all we know is a `` nominal '' plant transfer function @xmath12 , and the reality might well be a perturbation @xmath9 of this nominal transfer function @xmath12 .",
    "so one wishes the stabilizing controller @xmath10 found for the nominal @xmath12 to stabilize not only @xmath12 , but also all plants @xmath9 close enough to @xmath12 , and we would also like to be able to compute the radius of this neighbourhood ( so that the engineers are aware of the parametric uncertainity tolerated ) .",
    "[ c][c]@xmath12 [ c][c]@xmath10     the question of what should be an appropriate notion of distance one should use to measure closeness of unstable plants thus arises naturally .",
    "based on the goals described in the above paragraph , it is natural to demand a metric @xmath13 on the set of stabilizable plants such that    1 .",
    "@xmath13 is easily computable , and 2 .",
    "@xmath13 has the following property with respect to the stabilization problem : stabilizability becomes a robust property of stabilizable plants in this metric .",
    "in other words , if @xmath12 is stabilized by a controller @xmath10 , then there exists an @xmath14 such that every @xmath9 in the ball @xmath15 is stabilized by @xmath9 , and this @xmath16 should be easily computable too .",
    "such a metric was introduced by vinnicombe in @xcite when @xmath17 ( rational functions without poles in the right half plane or the imaginary axis ) , and was called the @xmath2-metric in @xcite .",
    "the definition of the @xmath2-metric was given in terms of _ normalized _ coprime factorizations .",
    "an abstract extension of this metric was given in @xcite in order to cover the case when @xmath18 , but rather @xmath5 is the class of stable transfer functions of infinite dimensional systems , for example , when @xmath5 is the callier - desoer algebra ( @xmath19 defined on page in the present article ) .",
    "the starting point in @xcite was abstract , where it was assumed that @xmath5 satisfies some mild assumptions , and then an abstract @xmath2-metric was defined on those elements of @xmath6 that possess a _ normalized _ coprime factorization .",
    "specific examples of @xmath5 satisfying the abstract assumptions and the resulting particular examples of the @xmath2-metric were given in @xcite .",
    "notably , that the case when @xmath20 is covered by the abstract set up was given in @xcite , but not the case when @xmath21 ( bounded and holomorphic functions in the unit disc with center @xmath22 in @xmath23 ) .",
    "[ def_hardy ] subsequently , in the auxiliary papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the abstract @xmath2-metric introduced in @xcite was _ applied _ in the particular case when @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite was essentially a new reformulation of @xcite ( where the case @xmath21 was covered first ) , while @xcite covered only the case of @xmath24 ( quasi analytic functions ) .",
    "in _ all _ of these , just like in @xcite , the @xmath2-metric relied on the existence of _ normalized _ coprime factorizations .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , existence of a coprime factorization of a plant does not automatically imply the existence of a normalized one , and even if a normalized one is known to exist , there may not be a computational procedure to find it .",
    "on the other hand , the problem of finding coprime factorizations is much more tractable than finding normalized coprime ones , and so it is desirable to find an extension of vinnicombe s metric which is given on the set of all plants that possess a coprime factorization .",
    "it is this issue that is addressed in the present paper .",
    "hence the results in the present work are not a consequence of these previous works .",
    "see the schematic diagram on page .",
    "[ c][c]@xmath25 [ c][c]@xmath26 [ c][c]@xmath27   [ heirachy ]    finally , we remark that in the previous work @xcite , we showed robustness of the property of _ strong _ stabilizability of the `` generalized chordal distance '' in a somewhat different setting .",
    "the point of the present work is that by considering a _ refinement _ of the generalized chordal distance from @xcite , we can show that the robustness of the property of _",
    "stabilizability_. we remark that in general rings @xmath5 ( for example in @xmath20 ) , the set of stabilizable plants is strictly bigger than the set of strongly stabilizable plants .",

    "we remark that the set of bounded and holomorphic functions defined in the open right half plane , and which possess a continuous extension to @xmath34 , can be transplanted to functions on the closed unit disk using the conformal map given by @xmath35 in this manner we may think of elements of @xmath36 as being elements of the disc algebra .    in each of these cases ,",

    "most of the details can be found in @xcite , except for ( i5 ) , but this verification is obvious .",
    "moreover , the @xmath43-norm in the definition of the @xmath0-metric is the usual supremum @xmath44-norm of functions in @xmath45 .",

    "moreover , we can define an involution in @xmath63 by setting @xmath106 and this implicitly defines an involution of elements in @xmath107 .",

    "from here we see that the @xmath43-norm in the definition of the @xmath0-metric is the usual @xmath44-norm of functions in @xmath50 .",
    "as an illustration , we consider ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example  4.3 ) , namely @xmath129 it was shown in @xcite that an algebraic spectral factorization leading to normalized coprime factors is not possible in this example .",
    "so calculating the @xmath2-metric between this plant and a perturbed one , say @xmath130 is problematic .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a coprime factorization of @xmath131 over @xmath132 of the half - plane @xmath133 , where @xmath134 that this is a coprime factorization over @xmath132 follows from the fact that @xmath135 solve the bezout equation @xmath136 : @xmath137 we will see that using this coprime factorization , we can compute @xmath138 fairly easily .",
    "we remark also that @xmath139 is the transfer function associated with the retarded delay differential equation @xmath140 for @xmath141 , and with @xmath142 , we have @xmath143 it is easy to see that since @xmath144 and for all @xmath145 , @xmath146 we have @xmath147 also , @xmath148 and so @xmath149 consequently for all @xmath150 small enough , for example , @xmath151 , we have @xmath152 so the condition that @xmath153 and @xmath154 will be satisfied for all such values of the parameter @xmath155 .",
