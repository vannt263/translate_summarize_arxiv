    "self - organization of dusty ( complex ) plasmas has been observed in numerous experiments .",
    "different types of structures formed in dusty plasmas under microgravity conditions ( in experiments performed on the international space station ) as well as on ground include compact clusters , voids surrounded by dust shells , vortices , etc . @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms governing such phenomena are associated with plasma fluxes generated due to electron and ion absorption on grains .",
    "plasma fluxes exert the forces which can result in the effect of dust self - confinement .",
    "it was shown theoretically that homogeneous dusty plasmas are intrinsically unstable @xcite . for small dusty clouds",
    "the long - range ( @xmath0 ) attraction between grains can be caused by ion `` shadowing '' forces , induced due to plasma absorption on the grain surfaces @xcite .",
    "the theory of such gravitation - like instability was developed for laboratory conditions , and the analogy with the jeans instability was pointed out . the important difference between the laboratory and space conditions are @xcite : ( i ) the volume ionization in astrophysical environment is much less important then in laboratory plasmas , ( ii ) the grain screening in space is described ( to a very good accuracy ) by a simple linear debye screening , while in laboratory conditions it is normally highly nonlinear , and ( iii ) the ratio of ion to electron temperatures in space is close to unity , while in laboratory experiments it is typically @xmath1 .",
    "these distinctions require new theoretical and numerical treatment of self - organization in space dusty plasmas .",
    "the principal aim of this paper is to point out the importance and possibility of dust self - organization in cosmic environments like the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "we present and solve the basic set of self - consistent equations describing equilibrium dusty clouds , identify necessary conditions for such clouds to exist , and analyze their stability .",
    "unlike stars , where the equilibrium is primarily governed by gravity and pressure , the dusty clouds are formed due to the balance of the ion drag force ( associated with the self - consistent plasma flux ) and the electrostatic force on charged grains .",
    "we show that cosmic dust can form stable spherical clouds , with typical sizes of the order of 10 - 100  au or less and with total mass of the order of @xmath2 earth mass or below .",
    "although the dust density inside the clouds can exceed the ambient density by many orders of magnitude  therefore we call them `` compact dusty clouds ''  they remain optically thin .",
    "we predict that this process can occur in a broad range of plasma parameters , which indicates that such self - organization might be a generic phenomenon operating in different astrophysical media .",
    "one particularly interesting application is the formation of compact dusty clouds in the diffuse ism .",
    "ultra - high resolution observation of interstellar absorption @xcite provide evidence that the diffuse ism is structured on scales below 1 pc , indicating the presence of tiny , distinct , dense and cold hi cloudlets , the origin of which is not understood up to now .",
    "this gas component might play an important role in regulating the thermodynamical state of the ism and in triggering phase transitions .",

[ stability ] we analyze stability of the obtained equilibrium clouds ; in sec .  [ positive ] we consider a simplified model for positively charged dust and show that equilibrium compact clouds can be formed in this case as well ; in sec .",

    "the principal parameters relevant for the further analysis are the gas temperature @xmath3 , the atomic hydrogen density @xmath4 , the molecular hydrogen density @xmath5 , and the density of hydrogen ions @xmath6 .",

    "this assumption significantly simplifies the force balance equation .",
    "fluid description of ions .",
    "_ we assume that the ion collisions with neutrals as well as with charged grains are frequent enough , so that the resulting mean free path of ions is much smaller than any macroscopic length scale of the problem .",
    "this allows us to introduce the local friction force on ions , which is proportional to their local flow velocity .",

    "the analysis below shows that typical sizes of dusty clouds are relatively small ( @xmath21  au ) .",
    "therefore , neglecting the centrifugal forces and inhomogeneities due to the mhd turbulence @xcite is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the condition to neglect tidal forces is discussed in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "these assumptions are only aimed to make the physical picture as transparent as possible , and demonstrate that the plasma absorption on dust grains results in a universal self - confinement effect which can lead to the formation of stable compact dusty clouds in cosmic environment .",
    "figure  [ fig.1 ] illustrates the principal role of plasma fluxes for dusty clouds .",
    "the absorption of electrons and ions by a single grain leads to its charging . in a plasma where external uv radiation does not play the dominant role",
    "the resulting charge is _ negative _ , because electrons are much faster than ions .",
    "then the equilibrium charge @xmath22 of a grain of radius @xmath18 , being presented in the dimensionless form @xcite , @xmath23 is normally about a few ( for isothermal hydrogen plasmas @xmath24 ) . in this paper",
    "we mostly discuss this charging regime .",
    "the case when uv radiation dominates and grains are charged _ positively _ is considered in sec .  [ positive ] .    for a large dusty cloud ,",
    "in addition to the local electron and ion fluxes in a close proximity of each grain , there is also a global plasma flux pointed inwards .",
    "the total flux @xmath25 fluctuates around its equilibrium value , @xmath26 , both due to fluctuations of plasma fluxes on individual particles and fluctuations of the particle density ( high - frequency fluctuations in electron - ion plasmas , not associated with dust and hence irrelevant to our problem , are neglected ) .",
    "the plasma flux is inevitably accompanied by the self - consistent electric field , @xmath27 . the fluctuating field ( associated with the fluctuating flux and/or grain charges )",
    "can result in a variety of interesting effects , such as stochastic particle acceleration  also in the astrophysical environment @xcite .",
    "in this paper we neglect the fluctuations and focus on the effect of the regular components ( so that the notation @xmath28 is omitted below ) . according to fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , the radial flux ( due to absorption in a spherical dusty cloud ) is always pointed towards the cloud center . the radial electric field generated in this case",
    "is directed inwards when grains are charged negatively ( while for positively charged grains it is pointed outwards , see sec .",
    "[ positive ] ) .",
    "thus , the average flux provides the confining effect via the ion drag force , and the average electric field tends to compensate for it via the electrostatic force .",
    "let us elaborate on this mechanism .",
    "the electric field force acting on a single charged grain is @xmath29 as for the ion drag force on the grain , @xmath30 , it consists of two parts arising due to the ion absorption and ion scattering @xcite . for astrophysical conditions",
    "the latter provides the major contribution due to a large value of the coulomb logarithm , @xmath31 , which yields @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the local ion density and flow velocity , respectively , and @xmath35 is the ion thermal velocity .",
    "furthermore , when considering a force on dust per unit volume , @xmath36 , one should take into account that @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( for given @xmath39 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , both forces are dominated by the small - size part of the mrn distribution @xcite , i.e. , the balance per unit volume is equivalent to the balance of forces on a single grain of some effective size ( near the small - size cutoff ) .",
    "the intrinsic length scale to be used further for the normalization is the ion mean free path ( for a fluid description of ions employed in this paper , it should be much smaller than the characteristic macroscopic length scale ) . since the density of neutrals is constant , we choose the ion mean free path due to collisions with neutral hydrogen , @xmath40 , as the natural length scale for the normalization of coordinates and forces ( as well as of the electric field ) , @xmath41 in the normalized form , the electrostatic and drag forces are @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 inside the dust region , the balance of averaged forces per grain yields @xmath45 thus , we derived the equilibrium equation relating the ion flow velocity and the associated electric field .",

    "the dust number density ( @xmath95 ) remains monotonous in the latter case , but the dust charge density ( @xmath51 ) exhibits a hump as well .",

    "we investigated the effect of this process inside the cloud by adding the source term @xmath130 to the r.h.s .",
    "of eq  ( [ balance_ion_flux ] ) .",
    "the analysis showed that as long as the plasma loss on dust dominates ( i.e. , the source term is much smaller than the absorption term ) the overall distributions as well as the size of the cloud remain practically unchanged .",

    "one can expect that the gas temperature inside the cloud is close to the dust temperature provided the mean free path of atoms / molecules due to collisions with dust , @xmath201 , does not exceed the cloud size @xmath202 . as we see from figs  [ fig.2]-[fig.4 ] , the latter varies between a few and a few dozens of the ion mean free path @xmath40 . taking this into account and also using eq .",
    "( [ example2 ] ) we obtain that the ratio @xmath203 is practically a universal constant , @xmath204 which is of the order of unity for any astrophysical environment .",
    "thus , the gas temperature inside dusty clouds should always be close to the dust temperature .",
    "next , we estimate the efficiency of the radiative dust cooling .",
    "the cooling time @xmath205 for an individual particle can be roughly obtained from the following balance : @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the sefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath208 is the specific heat of a grain material ( whose effective mass density is @xmath123  g/@xmath124 ) , and @xmath209 is the ( effective ) dust temperature . assuming @xmath210  k and @xmath114  cm we get @xmath211  s. this timescale",
    "should be compared with the characteristic heat diffusion time @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is the neutral mean free path .",
    "taking into account that for hydrogen @xmath214 , we get @xmath215  year for @xmath216  au .",
    "we conclude that the radiation is a very efficient cooling mechanism and , hence , @xmath209 can be much smaller than the ambient temperature @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we obtain the temperature profile of the gas around a dusty cloud , @xmath217 , by employing the conservation of the total diffusive heat flux , @xmath218  const . by solving this with the boundary conditions @xmath219 and @xmath220 and under the assumption of a constant pressure , @xmath221  const",
    ", we get that the size of the `` cold atmospheres '' around dusty clouds is always about a few @xmath202 .",
    "for example , the size of gaseous nuggets created by dusty clouds in wnm can reach a few hundreds of au , while the gas density inside such objects can be increased by a factor of @xmath222 ( for @xmath223  k ) .",
    "we showed that dust grains in various ism can self - organize themselves into equilibrium compact spherical clouds .",
    "the formation of such clouds is caused by the ion `` shadowing '' forces @xcite .",
    "this triggers the `` shadowing '' instability which resembles the jenans instability and originates from the generic mechanism of plasma absorption on dust grains .",
    "the confinement stabilizing equilibrium clouds is generated by the inward plasma flux which , in turn , is created due to the plasma absorption on dust .",
    "let us summarize the major characteristics of compact dusty clouds :    \\(i ) after proper normalization , the cloud is characterized by a combination of two global parameters  the normalized ion and dust densities at the center .",
    "the former is determined by the background plasma density in a given astrophysical environment , the latter is a free parameter whose variation is only limited by condition ( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) for typical astrophysical conditions , the size of compact clouds is below @xmath108  au .",
    "the dust density inside the clouds can exceed the background density by about 7 orders of magnitude , and their total mass can be as large as @xmath99 earth masses . at the same time , the optical depth of the clouds ( determined by the rayleigh scattering ) remains much smaller than unity .",
    "there have been a few reports on the existence of small - scale objects observed in different astrophysical environments , whose origins remain unclear . in particular ,",
    "ultra - high resolution observation of interstellar absorption @xcite have provided convincing evidence that the diffuse ism is structured on scales below 1 pc down to dozens of au , indicating the presence of tiny , distinct , dense and cold hi cloudlets , the origin of which is not understood up to now . as sketched in sec .",
    "[ diffuse ] , compact dusty clouds might trigger formation of such cloudlets",
    ". however , the details of their growth in the turbulent diffuse ism are certainly more complex than outlined by the simple hydrostatic model of sec .",
    "[ diffuse ] .",
    "we plan to investigate this interesting process in detail in a subsequent paper .",
    "also , the motion of compact clouds near the galactic center has been recently detected @xcite .",
    "some properties of these clouds ( e.g. , small optical depth , size @xmath224  au , and the mass smaller the earth mass ) are similar to those predicted by our model .",
    "the uv radiation near the galactic center is very strong , so that dust is positively charged and characteristics of the resulting clouds should be similar to those presented in sec .  [ positive ] .",
    "on the other hand , the tidal forces exerted on clouds in this region should be so strong ( see appendix  [ app1 ] ) that their equilibrium is highly questionable and requires further analysis .",
    "in conclusion , we would like to note that dust in ism is extremely polydisperse and , hence , different clouds are expected to contain grains of different sizes .",
    "understanding the size distribution of dusty clouds and their morphology would be a very important problem to address .",
    "another very interesting topic is to investigate coupling of dusty clouds ( and the surrounding atmosphere ) to the dynamics of the ambient ism . since the characteristic size of dusty clouds",
    "is expected to be much smaller that the cutoff scale of the mhd turbulence , one can use results of this paper as the input for such analysis .",
    "this work , performed in the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics ( mpe ) and general physics institute ras , is supported by the max planck society .",
    "one of the authors ( v.n.t . )",
    "thanks for the hospitality while staying at mpe .",
    "the formation of dusty clouds in a close proximity to stars or black holes requires more careful analysis due to the presence of gravitational forces neglected in this paper .",
    "below we estimate the condition when the resulting tidal force is small in comparison with the ion drag force [ eq .  (",
    "[ i d ] ) ] .    for a cloud of the radius @xmath202 , comprised of dust grains of size @xmath18 and located at the distance @xmath225 from a star / black hole of the mass @xmath226 , the tidal force is negligible when @xmath227 for instance , assuming @xmath228 ( corresponds to a massive black hole of our galaxy ) , @xmath229  au , @xmath230  cm , @xmath231  g/@xmath124 , @xmath232  @xmath233 , and @xmath234  ev",
