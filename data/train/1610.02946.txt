    "there are many systems showing hysteretic nonlinearity - rate independent memory effects . for ferromagnetic , ferroelectric or elasto - plastic materials etc",
    ". models of hysteresis such as the empirical preisach or jiles - atherton model are employed @xcite .",
    "however , complete analytic expressions for hysteresis loops , worked - out from basic physical phenomena , are rather rare .",
    "such a case is a magnetic moment of an induced shielding supercurrent in a type - ii superconductor in the critical state subjected to an applied time - varying magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the magnetization hysteresis loops are independent of field rate at low enough rates and when the field is cycled so that only major - loops are formed , the loops depend on the peak value of the field but not on the field waveform .",
    "hysteretic nonlinearity produces non - linear effects such as harmonics of the fundamental - frequency when a pure sinusoidal field is applied and frequency mixing when two sinusoidal field components are applied .",
    "when , for example the components at the fundamental - frequency and third - harmonic - frequency with fixed magnitudes are applied concurrently , the loops depend on a relative phase @xmath0 of these components , even if the effective value of the total field is constant .",
    "this is a consequence of a variation in the peak value of the field with @xmath0 .",
    "hence , a mean stored energy of the magnetic moment in the applied field and energy dissipated per fundamental field cycle depend on @xmath0 , too .",
    "this is a fundamental difference to linear systems , where a superposition principle holds and the relative phase of the field components plays no role .",
    "type - ii superconductors remain in the mixed state even in high magnetic fields owing to the creation of quantized vortices ( vortex lines ) @xcite .",
    "each vortex carries a single quantum @xmath1 of magnetic flux .",
    "the vortices or anti - vortices , according to the direction of the applied field , appear at an edge of a sample and propagate towards the sample s interior to homogenize its density .",
    "the moving vortex produces a time - varying magnetic field in the sample and thus dissipates electromagnetic energy .",
    "artificial defects of sub - micron scale are intentionally produced in the superconductor within its production process to pin the vortices in the material and thus prevent energy losses due to the relaxation of the magnetic flux density profiles @xcite .",
    "the strength of the pinning force determines the critical depinning current density @xmath2 , the maximum dc current density that can flow in the superconductor without energy dissipation .",
    "when transport or induced electric current @xmath3 flows in a sample , the lorentz force acts to unpin the vortices and gives rise to vortex diffusion or flow .",
    "the critical state occurs when the lorentz force and pinning force are balanced @xcite .",
    "the current density and vortex density profiles rearrange in a such way that the maximum current density is @xmath4 in the whole sample and the flux density profiles are with the gradient @xmath5 .",
    "since the screening supercurrent is persistent and a distribution of the current density and profiles of the flux density are quasi - static , work done by the lorentz force acting on the vortices against the pinning force is field rate independent , so the problem is analogous to a system with dry friction - like pinning .    on the basis of the critical state theory , distribution of the current density in the sample and generated magnetic moment @xmath6",
    "may be expressed as a function of the applied field @xmath7 and @xmath2 .",

    "infinite slabs and cylinders in a parallel field fall into first group @xcite .",

    "the initial magnetization curve for the strip is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the characteristic field @xcite .",
    "the initial magnetization curve determines the full magnetization hysteresis loop ,    @xmath16    where a branch @xmath17 is for the field @xmath7 monotonously non - increasing from @xmath18 to @xmath19 and branch @xmath20 is for the field @xmath7 monotonously non - decreasing from @xmath19 to @xmath18 .",
    "the shape of the magnetization loops depends only on the ratio between the peak value @xmath18 of the applied field and the characteristic field @xmath21 .",
    "owing to the large aspect ratio , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , of the flat samples in the transverse field the magnetization loops for the disks and strips , normalized to the magnetic moment of the sample with perfect screening , differ by less than 1.2% .",
    "numerical modelling shows the same similarity of the loops for flat rectangles and hence these may be well approximated by analytical expressions for the disks or strips @xcite .",
    "since both applied field @xmath24 and induced magnetic moment @xmath25 are periodic functions of time , we use a discrete fast fourier transform to analyse these waveforms .",

    "since hysteresis is a rate independent effect , both mean stored energy and energy dissipated per field cycle are frequency independent . in spite of it ,",
    "we use this notation for reasons that will become clear in following text .    the applied field",
