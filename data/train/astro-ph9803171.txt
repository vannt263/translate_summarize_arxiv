    "understanding the processes leading to the formation of stars is one of the fundamental challenges in astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "however , theoretical models considerably lag behind the recent observational progress . the analytical description of the star formation process is restricted to the collapse of isolated , idealized objects ( whitworth & summers 1985 ) .",
    "much the same applies to numerical studies ( e.g.  boss 1997 , burkert et al .",
    "1997 and reference therein ) .",
    "previous numerical models that treated cloud fragmentation on scales larger than single , isolated clumps were strongly constrained by numerical resolution .",
    "larson ( 1978 ) , for example , used just 150 particles in an sph - like simulation .",
    "whitworth et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were the first who addressed star formation in an entire cloud region using high - resolution numerical models .",
    "however , they studied a different problem : fragmentation and star formation in the shocked interface of colliding molecular clumps .",
    "while clump - clump interactions are expected to be abundant in molecular clouds , the rapid formation of a whole star cluster requires gravitational collapse on a size scale which contains many clumps and dense filaments .    here , we present a high - resolution numerical model describing the dynamical evolution of an entire _ region _ embedded in the interior of a molecular cloud .",
    "we follow the fragmentation into dense protostellar cores which form a hierarchically structured cluster .",
    "to follow the time evolution of the system , we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph : for a review see monaghan 1992 ) which is intrinsically lagrangian and can resolve very high density contrasts .",
    "we adopt a standard description of artificial viscosity ( monaghan & gingold 1983 ) with the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the smoothing lengths are variable in space and time such that the number of neighbors for each particle remains at approximately fifty .",
    "the system is integrated in time using a second order runge - kutta - fehlberg scheme , allowing individual timesteps for each particle .",
    "once a highly condensed object has formed in the center of a collapsing cloud fragment and has passed beyond a certain density , we substitute it by a ` sink ' particle which then continues to accrete material from its infalling gaseous envelope ( bate et al .  1995 ) . by doing",
    "so we prevent the code time stepping from becoming prohibitively small .",
    "this procedure implies that we can not describe the evolution of gas inside such a sink particle . for a detailed description of the physical processes inside a protostellar core , i.e. its further collapse and fragmentation",
    ", a new simulation just concentrating on this single object with the appropriate initial conditions taken from the larger scale simulation would be necessary ( burkert et al .",
    "1998 ) .    to achieve high computational speed ,",
    "we have combined sph with the special purpose hardware device grape ( ebisuzaki et al .",
    "1993 ) , following the implementation described in detail by steinmetz ( 1996 ) .",
    "since we wish to describe a region in the interior of a molecular cloud , we have to prevent global collapse .",
    "therefore , we use periodic boundaries , applying the ewald method in an pm - like scheme ( klessen 1997 ) .",
    "the structure of molecular clouds is very complex , consisting of a hierarchy of clumps and filaments on all scales ( e.g.  blitz 1993 ) .",
    "many attempts have been made to identify the clump structure and derive its properties ( stutzki & gsten 1990 , williams et al .  1994 ) .",
    "we choose as starting conditions gaussian random density fluctuations with a power spectrum @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the fields are generated by applying the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approximation to an originally homogeneous gas distribution : we compute a hypothetical field of density fluctuations in fourier space and solve poisson s equation to obtain the corresponding self - consistent velocity field .",
    "these velocities are then used to advance the particles in one single big timestep @xmath7 .",
    "we present simulations with @xmath8 and @xmath9 sph particles , respectively .",
    "1.2 cm    ( 12,10 ) ( 0.0 , 4.9)=6.5 cm ( 5.5 , 4.9)=6.5 cm ( 0.0,-0.0)=6.5 cm ( 5.5,-0.0)=6.5 cm ( 1.0 , 5.2)@xmath10 ( 6.5 , 5.2)@xmath11 ( 1.0 , 0.3)@xmath12 ( 6.5 , 0.3)@xmath13",
    "as a case study , we present the time evolution of a region in the interior of a molecular cloud with @xmath14 and containing a total mass of 222 jeans masses determined from the temperature and mean density of the gas . figure  [ fig:3d - plots ] depicts snapshots of the system initially , and when 10 , 30 and 60 per cent of the gas mass has been accreted onto the protostellar cores .",
    "note that the cube has to be seen periodically replicated in all directions . at the beginning ,",
    "pressure smears out small scale features , whereas large scale fluctuations start to collapse into filaments and knots .",
    "after @xmath15 , the first highly - condensed cores form in the centers of the most massive and densest jeans unstable gas clumps and are replaced by sink particles .",
    "soon clumps of lower mass and density follow , altogether creating a hierarchically - structured cluster of accreting protostellar cores . for a realistic timing extimate",
    ", the zeldovich shift interval @xmath16 has to be taken into account . in dimension - less time units ,",
    "the free - fall time of the isolated cube is @xmath17 .",
    "the gas is isothermal .",
    "hence , the calculations are scale free , depending only on one parameter : the dimensionless temperature @xmath18 , which is defined as the ratio between the internal and gravitational energy of the gas .",
    "the model can thus be applied to star - forming regions with different physical properties . in the case of a dark cloud with mean density @xmath19@xmath20 and a temperature @xmath21k like taurus - auriga",
    ", the computation corresponds to a cube of length 10@xmath22pc and a total mass of @xmath23m@xmath24 .",
    "the dimensionless time unit corresponds to @xmath25yrs . for a high - mass star - forming region like orion with @xmath26@xmath20 and @xmath27k these values scale to @xmath28pc and @xmath29m@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the time scale is @xmath30yrs .",
    "the location and the time at which protostellar cores form , is determined by the dynamical evolution of their parental gas clouds . besides collapsing individually , clumps stream towards a common center of attraction where they merge with each other or undergo further fragmentation .",
    "the formation of dense cores in the centers of clumps depends strongly on the relation between the timescales for individual collapse , merging and sub - fragmentation .",
    "individual clumps may become jeans unstable and start to collapse to form a condensed core in their centers .",
    "when clumps merge , the larger new clump continues to collapse , but contains now a _",
    "multiple _ system of cores in its center . now sharing a common environment ,",
    "these cores compete for the limited reservoir of gas in their surrounding ( see e.g.  price & podsiadlowski 1995 , bonnell et al .",
    "furthermore , the protostellar cores interact gravitationally with each other . as in dense stellar clusters ,",
    "close encounters lead to the formation of unstable triple or higher order systems and alter the orbital parameters of the cluster members . as a result",
    ", a considerable fraction of `` protostellar '' cores get expelled from their parental clump . suddenly bereft of the massive gas inflow from their collapsing surrounding",
    ", they effectively stop accreting and their final mass is determined .",
    "ejected objects can travel quite far and resemble the weak line t tauri stars found via x - ray observation in the vicinities of star - forming molecular clouds ( e.g.  neuhuser et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : mass - distr]a  d describe the mass distribution of identified gas clumps ( thin lines ) and of protostellar cores ( thick lines ) that formed within unstable clumps in a simulation analogous to fig .  [ fig:3d - plots ] , but with 10 times higher resolution . to identify individual clumps",
    "we have developed an algorithm similar to the method described by williams et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , but based on the framework of sph . as reference , we also plot the observed canonical form for the clump mass spectrum , @xmath0 ( blitz 1993 ) , which has a slope of @xmath31 when plotting @xmath1 versus @xmath32 .",
    "note that our initial condition does not exhibit a clear power law clump spectrum .",
    "the zeldovich approximation generates an overabundance of small scale fluctuations .",
    "however , in the subsequent evolution , these small clumps are immediately damped by pressure forces and non - linear gravitational collapse begins to create a power - law like mass spectrum .",
    "0.85 cm    ( 13.6,5.8 ) ( 1.00 , 2.70)=2.7625 cm ( 4.25 , 2.70)=2.7625 cm ( 1.00 , 0.10)=2.7625 cm ( 4.25 , 0.10)=2.7625 cm ( 9.00 , 0.10)=5.525 cm    a common feature in all our simulations is the broad mass spectrum of protostellar cores which peaks slightly above the overall _ jeans mass _ of the system .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , given the fact that the evolution of individual cores is highly influenced by complex dynamical processes . in a statistical sense , the system retains ` knowledge ' of its ( initial ) average properties .",
    "the present simulations can not resolve subfragmentation in condensed cores . since detailed simulations show that perturbed cores tend to break up into multiple systems ( e.g.  burkert et al .",
    "1997 ) , we can only determine the mass function of multiple systems .",
    "our simulations predict an initial mass function with a _ log - normal _ functional form .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass - distr]e compares the results of our calculations with the observed imf for multiple systems from kroupa et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . assuming a typical jeans mass @xmath33m@xmath24 and a star formation efficiency of individual cores of  10@xmath34% , the agreement between the numerically - calculated mass function and the observed imf for multiple systems ( thick dashed line ; from kroupa et al .",
    "1990 ) is excellent . for comparison ,",
    "also the imf corrected for binary stars ( kroupa et a.  1993 ) is indicated as thin solid line , together with the mass function from salpeter ( 1955 ) as thin dashed line .",
    "large - scale collapse and fragmentation in molecular clouds leads to a hierarchical cluster of condensed objects whose further dynamical evolution is extremely complex .",
    "the agreement between the numerically - calculated mass function and the observations strongly suggests that gravitational fragmentation and accretion processes dominate the origin of stellar masses .",
    "the final mass distribution of protostellar cores in isothermal models is a consequence of the chaotic kinematical evolution during the accretion phase .",
    "our simulations give evidence , that the star formation process can best be understood in the frame work of a probabilistic theory .",
    "a sequence of statistical events may naturally lead to a log - normal imf ( see e.g.  zinnecker 1984 , adams & fatuzzo 1996 ; also price & podsiadlowski 1995 , murray & lin 1996 , elmegreen 1997 ) .",
