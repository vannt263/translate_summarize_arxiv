    "before we state the main theorem , we introduce the following definitions .    in a graph @xmath36 , a walk",
    "@xmath75 @xcite of length @xmath76 is a sequence of vertices @xmath77 with @xmath78 for all @xmath79 when @xmath80 . if @xmath81 , then @xmath82 is simply a vertex @xmath83 .",

    "we can define a function of the walk @xmath89 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is indexed by the walk @xmath92 with values @xmath93 .",
    "the function @xmath94 is called the _ product of walk @xmath86_. in this work @xmath95 is either @xmath96 or @xmath97 .    in a graph @xmath36 ,",
    "all the possible walks of length @xmath76 form the @xmath98 space .",
    "denote a subspace of @xmath98 as @xmath99 if and only if    * the walk @xmath86 starts from an arbitrary vertex @xmath83 and ends at @xmath84 and visits all the vertices @xmath100 of @xmath36 , * there does not exist a vertex @xmath101 that divides @xmath86 into two sub - walks , where one walk starts at @xmath83 and ends at @xmath102 , the other one starts at @xmath102 and ends at @xmath103 , that both of them visit all the vertices @xmath100 of @xmath36 .",
    "note that the end vertex of the previous sub - walk and the starting vertex of the following sub - walk are repeated twice when dividing a walk .",
    "it is trivial that for @xmath86 walks of length @xmath104 , they ca nt be in the @xmath99 subspace .",

    "we also say that @xmath111 is the _ order _ of the walk @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath113 for any order @xmath111 .",

    "theorem [ th_bound ] provides another method to prove that the distributed algorithm converges to the true solution @xmath16 besides the mixed norm method in @xcite , which is discussed at the end of this work .",
    "the bound in connects the network topology with the convergence rate of the algorithm , by the degree @xmath132 of agent @xmath35 explicitly , and by counting the number of @xmath133 walks in every order @xmath116 in the network implicitly . before moving to the detailed proof of this theorem",
    ", we first discuss how topology impacts the performance of the algorithm . to illustrate the topology impacts , we start with the definition of a walk @xmath134 , then we discuss the properties of the corresponding @xmath135 product .",
    "given a network @xmath36 of size @xmath32 , all the possible walks of length @xmath42 are determined by its adjacency matrix @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath136 be the inverse degree of agent @xmath35 , then the product @xmath137 can be represented by @xmath138 , where we recall that @xmath139 is indexed by the walk @xmath140 .",
    "for simplicity , we let @xmath141 and @xmath142 . hence given a starting agent @xmath35 ,",
    "the summation of all products of the walk @xmath143 from @xmath35 to all the agents @xmath144 is represented as @xmath145 . in general",
    ", we have @xmath146 it is trivial that for any @xmath111 , @xmath35 , @xmath121 and the walk @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "we now explore a scenario when the above mentioned sum remains a constant , even if the walk length increases .",
    "given a network @xmath36 and given a starting agent @xmath35 , if all walks @xmath149 , @xmath144 are repeated by walks @xmath150 who visit one more agent @xmath151 at the end , after reaching agent @xmath121 , then the summation of all @xmath152 products remains the same .",
    "this visit of agent @xmath151 generates @xmath32 products based on each @xmath153 and each of them equals to @xmath154 , @xmath144 . only @xmath155 out of @xmath32 products are not zero when @xmath156 . the summation of all newly generated products is unchanged , which is @xmath157 for @xmath158 . in general , the summation of all products of all walks by @xmath159 visits starting from a given agent @xmath35 to all the neigbors of all the agents @xmath121 is @xmath160    given a network @xmath36 and a starting agent @xmath35 , the summation @xmath161 is never increasing and the order @xmath111 of the @xmath162 product is never decreasing as the walk length @xmath42 grows .",
    "given an arbitrary @xmath163 product of the walk @xmath164 , when the walk @xmath165 makes one more visit from agent @xmath166 to the next agent @xmath167 , it forms @xmath168 new products and the summation of all @xmath168 products is unchanged , which is already shown in .",
    "however , there exists a walk of length @xmath169 when there exists at least one walk changing from the @xmath170 subspace to the @xmath171 subspace . for every @xmath172 walk ( of order @xmath173 ) of length @xmath174",
    ", it never changes to a walk of order @xmath114 .",
    "this hold for any walk @xmath175 , hence the summation of all @xmath135 , @xmath175 product is never increasing , that is @xmath176 and given a walk of length @xmath42 and a starting agent @xmath35 , the bound in decreases when the order of walks increases , due to the exponential factor @xmath177 . since the summation of all @xmath178 products starting from a chosen agent @xmath35 is always @xmath179 , the bound in [ th_bound ] can only be decreased by either i ) for a fixed length @xmath42 , increasing the percentage of walks with higher @xmath111 , or ii ) by increasing the order @xmath111 for all walks as rapidly as possible .    with the above two observations",
    "we conclude that given any two networks @xmath180 and @xmath181 , the distributed algorithm tends to converge faster on networks @xmath180 if @xmath180 and @xmath181 have similar topology properties except any combinations of the following    * @xmath180 has a shorter diameter , * @xmath180 has a more homogeneous degree distribution , * @xmath180 has a higher mean degree .",
    "although theorem [ th_bound ] has @xmath139 as a factor in the products , it is not trivial to conclude that higher degree makes the products smaller since higher degree decreases each product while increases the number of products .",
    "the summation of all products remains a constant , as shown in .",
    "however the bound decreases when the order @xmath111 of the products increases .",
    "we address these three points in order .      for two graphs @xmath180 and @xmath181 with the same degree distribution and hence the same mean degree , if @xmath180 has a shorter diameter @xcite than @xmath181 , then for fixed @xmath42 , walks from @xmath180 will necessarily have a larger minimum order @xmath111 as compared to those from @xmath181 .",
    "this follows from the fact that all the agents can be visited with fewer steps in a network with shorter diameter .",
    "thus , all things being equal between two graphs , if @xmath182 increases more rapidly for one graph as opposed to another , the exponential factor @xmath183 will decrease more rapidly",
    ". therefore networks with shorter diameter make the distributed algorithm converge faster .      let @xmath180 and @xmath181 be two graphs with same mean degree but different degree distributions .",
    "let @xmath180 have a more homogeneous degree distribution than @xmath181",
    ". walks in @xmath181 typically have lower order @xmath111 than the walks of the same length in @xmath180 .",
    "this is because walks on @xmath181 rather than @xmath180 have to walk though the high degree vertices again and again to reach all the other low degree vertices .",
    "hence for a given length of walks , the order @xmath111 from the walks on @xmath180 is higher .",
    "therefore homogeneous degree distribution makes the algorithm converges faster .      adding edges to a graph typically results in a shorter diameter . given two graphs @xmath180 and @xmath181 with similar degree distribution where @xmath180 has a higher mean degree , the diameter of @xmath180 is typically no larger than @xmath181",
    ". hence the orders @xmath111 s from @xmath180 are typically higher than those in @xmath181 for walks of fixed length . adding a new edge",
    "can either make the degree distribution homogeneous or make it heterogeneous , depending on where the new edge is added .",
    "the overall change of degree distribution for each newly added edge is difficult to analyze .",
    "however , if multiple new edges are added uniformly to a graph , this will typically result in a more homogeneous degree distribution , thus increasing the mean degree of the network makes the distributed algorithm converge faster .      to verify our theoretical predictions",
    ", we perform extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we first quantify the convergence rate of the network - based distributed algorithm .",
    "one measure is the solution accuracy of the algorithm , which is the euclidean distance between the local solution and the exact ( or global ) one : @xmath184 smaller @xmath185 means faster convergence rate and hence better algorithm performance .",
    "the impacts of different network topologies are measured by the statistical performances of the distributed algorithm , i.e. @xmath186 on an ensemble of linear equations .",
    "we notice that the euclidean distance defined above needs a reference .",
    "for example , if the true solutions of two cases are @xmath187 and @xmath188 respectively , while the summation of euclidean distances of all local solutions to @xmath189 are both @xmath190 , @xmath191 , it is obvious the accuracy of the former iterative process is much higher than the latter one . therefore the euclidean distance should be scaled by the initial error @xmath192 , yielding the relative error @xmath193 in this way , convergence performances among a system of linear equations can be compared .",
    "[ fig_cv_box ] shows the relative error changes with different network topologies , including small - world ( sw ) networks @xcite with random rewiring probability @xmath194 , scale - free ( sf ) networks @xcite with degree exponent @xmath195 , erds - rnyi ( er ) random graphs @xcite with connectivity probability @xmath194 and random regular ( rr ) graphs @xcite with mean degree @xmath196 .",
    "the networks in each subfigure are the same in their mean degree and they are different on only one parameter .",
    "small - world networks ( a - c ) are different in rewiring probabilities @xmath194 , which determines network diameters . scale - free networks , graphs and rr graphs are drastically different in their degree distributions : scale - free networks are most heterogeneous and random regular graphs are most homogeneous .",
    "the numerical results shown in figure .  [ fig_cv_box ] clearly verify our theoretical predictions , i.e. if two networks share similar topological properties , the one with smaller diameter ( or more homogeneous degree distribution , or higher mean degree ) perform better than the other . to further demonstrate the topology impacts , consider @xmath197 at @xmath198 shown as box - and - whisker plots in figure .",
    "[ fig_cv_last_all ] . the smaller relative error @xmath197 means higher convergence rate .",
    "it is clear from figure .",

    "[ fig_cv_last_all]d - f that the upper bound of relative errors decreases as the mean degree increases for a given network model . in other words ,",
    "higher mean degree makes the algorithm reach the true solution faster , and is consistent with our theoretical analysis .",
    "[ fig_cv_last_all]a - c display that small - world networks with higher rewiring probability ( and hence smaller diameters ) have smaller relative errors @xmath199 , confirming our theoretical prediction smaller diameter contributes to higher convergence rate . as shown in figure .",
    "[ fig_cv_last_all]d - f , for any given mean degree , the random regular graphs have the smallest relative errors while scale free networks perform the worst .",

    "furthermore the @xmath309 bound theorem [ th_s ] clearly explains the reason that kaczmarz s algorithm is slower than a randomized kaczmarz s algorithm @xcite .    with the help of @xmath311",
    "bound theorem [ th_sbar ] and @xmath309 bound theorem [ th_s ] , each product in the error updating equation can be divided into two parts and bounded separately .",
    "one corresponding to the @xmath309 product part where @xmath173 and all the @xmath312 are present and the other one corresponding to the @xmath311 product part where not all @xmath312 are present",
    ". we can now prove the bound theorem [ th_bound ] .",
    "let @xmath313 denote the corresponding @xmath213 product of the error sequence in , then according to the @xmath311 bound theorem [ th_sbar ] and @xmath309 theorem [ th_s ] the error updating equation is bounded as follows @xmath314 where @xmath315 .",
    "hence the proof is finished .",
    "the bound in gives another proof that the distributed algorithm studied in this paper converges to @xmath16 for connected undirected networks , as shown below .",
    "note that the order of a @xmath231 walk typically increases as the length of walks keeps growing , since @xmath36 is a connected network .",
    "this implies that for any given order @xmath111 , the total number of @xmath240 is limited and hence the summation of all corresponding @xmath316 products is bounded , for the summation of all walks is 1 .",
    "the number of all walks starting at vertex @xmath88 for any given order @xmath111 and length @xmath42 can be estimated by combinatorics .",
    "this method is shown when the network topology is a complete graph . for",
    "any given network , the number of walks can be bounded similarly , but it can become quite involved .    for any walk of length @xmath42 starting at a fixed vertex @xmath83 in a complete network @xmath317 ,",
    "the total number of all walks is @xmath318 .",
    "let @xmath319 . in order to count",
    "the maximum number of @xmath320 walks , we first choose subsets of vertices @xmath321 by picking @xmath322 vertices out of @xmath32 and @xmath323 by picking @xmath324 vertices except the case @xmath83 is not picked , which results in walks in @xmath325 space rather than @xmath326 .",
    "there are a total @xmath327 of @xmath328 sets where @xmath329 , @xmath322 and @xmath330 of @xmath331 sets .",
    "then we choose a vertex with replacement each time from @xmath328 and @xmath331 and put it into the sequence of walks to generate all possible walks .",
    "the total number @xmath332 of @xmath333 walks is @xmath334 the @xmath335 walks are regarded as combinations of @xmath336 walks and @xmath337 walks .",
    "we first choose @xmath32 positions out of @xmath42 in the sequences of walks and make these @xmath32 positions form @xmath336 walks .",
    "there are @xmath338 ways to choose @xmath32 vertices to form a @xmath339 set and the number @xmath340 walks is exactly @xmath341 for each set , so the number of different sub - sequences in @xmath342 walks is @xmath343 .",
    "the number of walks @xmath344 is simply @xmath345 .",
    "hence the number of @xmath342 walks is bounded by @xmath346 in general cases where @xmath347 , we pick @xmath32 positions out of @xmath348 locations to form the first @xmath336 walk sequence and pick the left - over locations till @xmath349 to form the second @xmath336 walk and so on .",
    "let @xmath169 denote the start position and @xmath350 be the end position picked out by the first @xmath336 walk sequence , then the total number of sub - sequences is @xmath351 .",
    "define @xmath352 similarly , then the second @xmath336 walk sequence can pick from position @xmath174 till @xmath353 in the original @xmath240 sequence .",
    "the total number of sub - sequences for the second @xmath336 walk is @xmath354 .",
    "the total number of @xmath355 walks is bounded by @xmath356 the number of total walks then satisfies @xmath357 since @xmath358 reduces exponentially to 0 .",
    "this means for any given order @xmath111 , the corresponding walks account for only a minor portion of all walks .",
    "in other words , the order of all products keeps growing when the length of walks increases .",
    "since the summation of all @xmath359 products is 1 and the limit of the portion of walks among all walks of a given order @xmath360 is @xmath361 , therefore the following two limits exist @xmath362 for any finite @xmath360 .",
    "furthermore , the limit of the error in satisfies the following @xmath363 where @xmath364 .",
    "therefore the algorithm converges as all the @xmath365 for regular networks .",
    "future work will look to analyze the combinatorics of more general network topologies .",
    "in this work , we systematically study the impact of network topology on the performance of a network - based distributed algorithm in solving linear algebraic equations .",
    "both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that networks with higher mean degree , smaller diameter , and more homogeneous degree distribution make the algorithm converge faster .",
    "interestingly , @xmath366-regular random networks with small mean degree could have a comparable performance as degree - heterogeneous networks with very high mean degree .",
    "hence , it is possible to reduce the communication cost ( i.e. by designing sparser networks ) and simultaneously keep the fast convergence rate .    besides classical consensus problems",
    ", we expect that more complicated problems can also be solved with network - based distributed algorithms .",
    "our results presented here provide a method to analyse the topology impacts on a network - based distributed algorithm .",
    "it may shed light on the design of better network topologies to improve the performance of general multi - agent distributed algorithms in solving more challenging real - world problems .",
