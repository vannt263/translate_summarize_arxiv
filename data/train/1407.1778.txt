    "in case of several applied sciences including economics , finance , hydrology etc . , modeling the rare events is becoming very important now - a - days ; it is essential to study the unusual big losses in insurance , analyze equity risk , predict rare natural disasters .",
    "for all those cases , probability of the event of interest is very small compared to our past observations although very crucial as they may produce a huge risk ( loss ) in practice ; known as the  worst - case risk \" .",
    "the statistical tool that helps to analyze such situations is the extreme value theory .",
    "thus , in recent era , there is a growing trend of fruitful literatures about the inference under extreme value models .",
    "these models generally have a thicker tail compared to the normal models and the probabilities of rare events are modeled by non - zero tail probabilities of such heavy - tailed distributions . for univariate cases , such distributions can be characterized by its tail index that measure , in layman s term , the thickness of the tail and by some assumptions about its probability density function in tail region . for multivariate cases ,",
    "although the marginals can be characterized in the same way , specification of their joint distribution requires additional effort to capture their dependence structure in the tail .",
    "further , this tail dependence always may not have a linear structure ; for example , in financial markets , the dependences between returns are mostly non - linear .",
    "generally such non - linear dependence in the tail region is modeled by means of  copula \" function specifying its pattern and the extend of dependence is measured by introducing an index parameter , known as the coefficient of tail dependence .",
    "thus , the estimation of this index parameter is crucial in multivariate extreme value theory and , as one can expect , there exist several estimators for this purpose ; for example see the works of ledford and tawn ( 1996 , 1997 ) , beirlant and vandewalle ( 2002 ) , heffernan and tawn ( 2004 ) , draisma et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , goegebeur and guillou ( 2012 ) among others .",
    "however , existing literatures do not take care into account the outlying observations present in data and most of the estimators of tail dependence coefficient , if not all , are highly sensitive to those outliers .",
    "however , in real practice , there can be a significant portion of outliers in sample with respect to the assumed model , either due to ignorance of some external factor , or erroneous input in some level of data collection ; but ignoring the external factors are not recommended while we are using a bivariate model to asses risk or market returns . in such cases ,",
    "our inference without proper control over these outliers about the tail events may changes drastically and overall objective of the study fails to produce a big loss in most cases .",
    "there are some recent attempts to produce robust estimator of the tail index in univariate cases ( see kim and lee , 2008 , for example ) ; but the multivariate counterpart seem not to receive such attention till now . in this paper , we consider the bivariate extreme value distribution and propose some estimators for the coefficient of the tail dependence that are highly robust with respect to the outlying observations in the sample ; also the proposed estimators will be seen to give quite competitive and sometimes better results even in case of pure data . however , to make the paper appealing to a large class of applied scientist even outside the community of mathematicians , we will not present any complicated asymptotics of the proposed estimators ; rather illustrate their robustness through the graphical approach of influence function analysis and their bias and mse through various numerical examples considering several kind of dependence structures and presence of possible outliers .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we start with a brief introduction to the bivariate heavy tailed distributions , its coefficient of tail dependence and some common existing estimators in section [ sec : ht_distr_intro ] . in section",
    "[ sec : robust_est ] we will propose some new estimator of the tail dependence coefficient with special attention to its robustness and explore their robustness using the classical influence function analysis in section [ sec : robustness ] .",
    "the performance of the proposed estimators will be examined though an extensive simulation study in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "finally we will end this paper with a short overall discussion .",
    "suppose @xmath0 denotes a pair of random variables with joint distribution function @xmath1 and marginal distribution functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "further let the marginals to be known having unit frchet distributions ( @xmath4 for @xmath5 ) or unit pareto distribution ( @xmath6 for @xmath7 ) . in most practical cases , estimation of probability of any tail event was done based on the assumption of asymptotic dependence between the two variables as it was difficult to obtain the limiting joint probability estimate of any extreme event ( both variables exceeding some large threshold depending on the sample size ) .",
    "the problem was solved by ledford and tawn ( 1996 , 1997 ) who proposed an alternative model for joint probability of bivariate extreme event that can be estimated even under asymptotic independence .",
    "they have assumed that the probability @xmath8 is a regularly varying function of @xmath9 at zero with index @xmath10 ; more precisely , for @xmath11 $ ] @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a slowly varying function satisfying @xmath14 the parameter @xmath15 measures the extent of asymptotic tail dependence between the two variables @xmath0 with larger values indicating greater association and is known as the coefficient of tail dependence or the tail dependence index . in particular , the cases with @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] represent asymptotic dependence whereas all other cases represent asymptotic independence .",
    "ledford and tawn ( 1996 ) further identified three types of asymptotic independence based on the values of @xmath15 ; see also heffernan ( 2000 ) or goegebeur and guillou ( 2012 ) .",
    "further note that , under the assumption of continuous marginals ( either frchet or pareto ) , we have @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the copula function of joint distribution @xmath1 and hence all the bivariate distributions can be characterized in terms of their copula function .",
    "some useful examples of copula structures are given below ( see , e.g. , aas , 2004 for details ) :    * * bivariate normal copula :  * it corresponds to the most popular bivariate normal distribution ( symmetric ) with correlation coefficient @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the case with @xmath21 have asymptotically independent structure with @xmath22 .",
    "thus , in general , this simple model does not allow for joint fat - tail .",
    "+ * * bivariate student s @xmath9-copula :  * it corresponds to the bivariate student s @xmath9-distribution ( symmetric ) with correlation coefficient @xmath20 $ ] and degrees of freedom @xmath23 .",
    "this model allows for joint fat - tail and higher probability of co - extreme events regardless of their marginal distributions ; however , the power of exhibiting such events decreases as @xmath23 increases .",
    "see demarta and mcneil ( 2005 ) for more details on @xmath9-copula and the formuls for its tail dependence coefficient .",
    "+ * * gumbel copula :  * it is an asymmetric copula allowing us to model the same in dependence structures , for example the equity return dependence structures reported by longin and solnik ( 2001 ) or ang and chen ( 2000 ) .",
    "it exhibits greater dependence in the positive tail and has an explicit form given by @xmath24^{1/\\delta}\\right ) , $ ] here @xmath25 $ ] controls the extent of dependence ; @xmath26 gives perfect dependence and @xmath27 corresponds to independence with @xmath28 . + * * clayton copula :  * it is also an asymmetric copula , but exhibits greater dependence in the negative tail .",
    "it has the explicit form given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 controls the extent of dependence ; @xmath26 implies independence and @xmath31 corresponds to perfect dependence . here also , @xmath27 yields @xmath32 .",
    "our main objective is to estimate the dependence index @xmath15 based on a observed sample @xmath33 of size @xmath34 on the random vector @xmath0 and there exist different methods for this estimation problem .",
    "the main root to most of these methods is to transfer the problem into one - dimensional tail index estimation and then apply the suitable techniques on the transformed univariate heavy - tailed random variable .",
    "let us assume @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath37 so that @xmath38 represent independent and identically distributed random observations from a univariate heavy - tailed distribution with tail index @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , one can estimate the dependence index @xmath15 by applying the univariate theory on the minimum of two variables ; but in that case we must standardized the marginal distribution first to the assumed one  unit frchet or unit pareto distribution . for the observed sample , this standardization can be done using their empirical marginals ; let @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the rank of @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively in the sample . then we use minimum of the unit frchet transformed marginals given by @xmath43 or use minimum of the unit pareto transformed marginals given by @xmath44 now , there are many techniques that can be applied to this univariate problem and their properties are discussed in the context of estimating the bivariate tail dependence index by many researchers ; see hill ( 1975 ) , smith ( 1987 ) , dekkers et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , beirlant and vandewalle ( 2002 ) , beirlant et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , goegebeur and guillou ( 2012 ) among others . among all these estimators ,",
    "the simplest and classical technique is the hill estimator , which is basically the maximum likelihood estimators assuming the exponential distribution for the logarithmic relative excesses over a given threshold ; it also has an explicit form given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the @xmath47 order statistics in @xmath48 .",
    "the estimator used by beirlant and vandewalle ( 2002 ) is also a maximum likelihood estimator based on an exponential regression model approximation .",
    "alternatively dekkers et al .",
    "( 1989 ) used a moment estimator and goegebeur and guillou ( 2012 ) used a functional estimator of @xmath15 .",
    "however , these estimators along with most of the others are non - robust with respect to the presence of outliers in data .",
    "the non - robust nature of similar estimators was observed in case of univariate models by many researchers and there is few recent attempts to make them robust .",
    "here we will consider two such robust methods that exploits the special structure of the density power divergence ( basu et al . , 1998 ) and down - weights the outlying observations by a non - zero power of model density to generate robust inference .",
    "one such approach is introduced by kim and lee ( 2008 ) who have generalized the hill s estimator to achieve robustness under similar model assumptions ; another proposal has been made very recently by ghosh ( 2014 ) assuming the exponential regression model and hence produce robust generalization of the beirlant and vandewalle ( 2002 ) estimator .",
    "we will apply these two concepts in the present bivariate problem of estimating the coefficient of tail dependence and study their properties in view of several bivariate heavy - tailed model .",
    "consider the set - up of @xmath34 bivariate heavy - tailed observations with unit frchet marginals and define the transformed variables @xmath49 by ( [ eq : frechet_transform ] ) .",
    "we will apply the robust generalization of the hill s estimator to this case following kim and lee ( 2008 ) .",
    "let @xmath50 denotes the distribution function of the unit frchet transformed marginals @xmath49 which , in view of ( [ eq : transformed_univariate ] ) , is a heavy - tailed distribution with tail index @xmath15 .",
    "we will assume that the log - relative excess of the variable @xmath51 over a given threshold follows an exponential distribution with mean @xmath15 , i.e. , for all @xmath52 there exists a sequence @xmath53 of positive numbers satisfying @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 . under this assumption , we can model @xmath58 as @xmath34 independent and identically distributed observation from exponential distribution with mean @xmath15",
    ". then @xmath15 can be estimated by minimizing the density power divergence ( dpd ) between the data and the exponential model ( basu et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the density power divergence down - weights the outlying observations by @xmath59 power of model density with @xmath60 $ ] and generate robust estimators ; note that the case @xmath61 produces no outlier down - weighting at all and coincides with the non - robust maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "further , we will replace the unknown term @xmath62 by @xmath63 following the suggestion of kim and lee ( 2008 ) .",
    "then , a routine calculation shows that the corresponding estimating equation is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the solution of this estimating equation will give us an estimator of @xmath15 that we call as the dpd based estimator of @xmath15 and denote it by @xmath67 .",
    "clearly , for any fixed sample size @xmath34 , this estimator depends on the choice of tuning parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "interestingly , the estimator @xmath70 coincides with the hill s estimator defined in ( [ eq : hill_est ] ) .      as an alternative to the above approach of robust estimation of @xmath15 , we will now present another type of estimators with the exponential regression model approximation as given in matthyas and beirlant ( 2001 ) . again",
    "consider the set - up of @xmath34 bivariate heavy - tailed observations as given in section [ sec : ht_distr_intro ] with the transformed univariate observations @xmath51 .",
    "assume that the scaled log - ratios of excess in the univariate heavy - tailed observations @xmath49 over a large threshold @xmath63 , defined as @xmath71 follow approximately an exponential regression model ( erm ) @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 being independent and identically distributed random variables with mean @xmath75 .",
    "beirlant and vandewalle ( 2002 ) used this approximation and obtained the estimator of tail dependence coefficient @xmath15 using the maximum likelihood approach , which has the well - known lack of robustness property .",
    "note that , the random variables @xmath76 are independent but not identically distributed under above approximation .",
    "recently ghosh and basu ( 2013 ) developed a robust estimation procedure for such cases of independent but non - homogeneous observations using the density power divergence and ghosh ( 2014 ) applied the same for estimating the tail index in univariate case with the exponential regression model . here , to estimate the tail dependence index @xmath15 under bivariate models , we can use the similar approach ; obtain the estimator minimizing the average density power divergence over those @xmath77 non - homogeneous data points . as noted in beirlant and vandewalle ( 2002 ) , with this approximation of erm",
    ", we can assume both frchet or pareto distribution for marginals and define the transformed variables @xmath49 accordingly using ( [ eq : frechet_transform ] ) or ( [ eq : pareto_transform ] ) respectively .",
    "then , the estimating equation of this case is given by @xmath78 = 0 ,   \\label{eq : est_eqn_erm}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 .",
    "we will denote the estimator obtained as a solution to this estimating equation as @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively based on whether the marginals are assumed to be frchet or pareto distributed .",
    "note that , the case with @xmath61 coincides with the estimator obtained by beirlant and vandewalle ( 2002 ) and the estimator with @xmath82 produces a robust generalization of their estimator of tail dependence coefficient .",
    "the influence function introduced by hampel ( 1968 , 1974 ) is a classical tool used in robust statistics ; it helps to examine the behavior of an estimator under infinitesimal contamination through corresponding statistical functional .",
    "consider a random sample @xmath83 from a @xmath84-variate distribution @xmath85 which we want to model by a parametric family @xmath86 .",
    "suppose our estimator @xmath87 of @xmath88 can be expressed as a solution of the estimating equation @xmath89 for suitable function @xmath90 ; such estimators with a few additional conditions are known as the m - estimator and can be robust with some particular choices of @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath92 denotes the empirical distribution function based on the above sample .",
    "then , we can write the estimator as @xmath93 for the corresponding statistical functional @xmath94 , defined as the solution of @xmath95 note that we get equation ( [ eq : m - est ] ) from ( [ eq : if - est_eqn ] ) replacing @xmath85 by @xmath92 .",
    "the value of @xmath96 is called the best fitting parameter under the true distribution @xmath85 ; if the true distribution belongs to the model family with @xmath97 , then we should have @xmath98 .",
    "this philosophy is used for all the minimum distance ( or divergence ) estimators including the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "consider the contaminated distribution @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the degenerate distribution at the contamination point @xmath101 ( in the sample space ) and let @xmath102 .",
    "then the influence function of the estimator defined by the functional @xmath103 at the true distribution @xmath85 is defined as @xmath104 = \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\theta_\\epsilon}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\epsilon=0},\\ ] ] provided it exists .",
    "thus the influence function measures the effect of infinitesimal contamination at a point @xmath101 on the asymptotic bias of the estimator , standardized by the by the proportion of contamination .    to obtain the influence function for the functional estimator @xmath105 defined by ( [ eq : if - est_eqn ] ) , we replace @xmath88 and @xmath85 in ( [ eq : if - est_eqn ] ) by @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively and then differentiate it with respect to @xmath108 at @xmath109 ; after collecting suitable terms it yields the required influence function having the form @xmath110 note that this influence function is bounded with respect to @xmath101 whenever the term @xmath111 is bounded with respect to @xmath101 for all @xmath88 ; this plays the main role to choose suitable @xmath91-function generating robust m - estimators .",
    "now let us derive the influence function of the proposed dpd based estimator @xmath67 to get the idea about its robustness .",

    "so we can use the technique described above to obtain its influence function . note that if @xmath114 is the true distribution of the bivariate heavy - tailed random variables @xmath0 with marginals @xmath115 and @xmath116 , then the distribution of @xmath117 is given by @xmath118 . define corresponding statistical functional @xmath119 at this @xmath85 , as solution of the equation",

    "this proves the well - known non - robust nature of the hill s estimator .",

    "note that , all influence function with @xmath82 are bounded and their supremum decreases with increasing @xmath68 which implies that the robustness of corresponding estimator increases as @xmath68 increases .",
    "however , their influence function and hence robustness does not differ significantly for the values of @xmath131 .          now let us consider the alternative robust estimator @xmath80 and @xmath81 obtained under the assumption of the exponential regression model .",

    "so , we can not obtain its influence function as defined in section [ sec : if ] . in this case ,",
    "we will follow ghosh and basu ( 2013 ) who have derived the influence function under the similar set - up of non - identically distributed observations ; in contrast to the i.i.d .  case , their influence function and statistical functional under the non - homogeneous set - up depends on the sample size and is termed as the fixed - sample influence function . see ghosh and basu ( 2013 ) for more details .",
    "similar idea is used also by ghosh ( 2014 ) in case of univariate tail index estimation under the similar exponential regression set - up .",
