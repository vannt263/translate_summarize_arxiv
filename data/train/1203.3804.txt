    "decays of the @xmath4 meson to the final state occur via a singly  cabibbo  suppressed ( scs ) transition .",
    "there are two possible decays , @xmath16 and @xmath14 ( charge conjugation is implied throughout the paper unless otherwise specified ) , where the first is decay is favored with respect to the second .",
    "these twin decays are of interest for a variety of reasons .",
    "firstly when produced through a @xmath17 decay , where @xmath3 is either a @xmath4 or @xmath5 , they can be exploited to measure the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) phase @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "secondly a time ",
    "dependent study can be used to determine charm mixing parameters and probe for charm @xmath18 violation  @xcite .",
    "finally , examination of the resonant substructure of the decays allows for tests of su(3 ) flavor symmetry in charm meson decays  @xcite .",
    "this paper describes several measurements performed with data collected by the cleo experiment that are valuable for each of these purposes .",
    "these are a first determination of the coherence factor and average strong  phase difference for the two decays , a determination of the relative branching ratio of the decays that is more precise than previous measurements  @xcite , and the presentation of isobar models to describe each decay . the coherence factor  and the average strong  phase difference  @xcite for @xmath19 are measured using quantum  correlated , fully  reconstructed @xmath4@xmath5  pairs produced in @xmath6 collisions at the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "knowledge of these parameters improves the sensitivity of measurements of the unitary triangle angle @xmath1 using @xmath20 meson decays to @xmath21 where the @xmath3 decays to @xmath22 or @xmath23 . to probe for the effects of physics beyond the standard model",
    ", it will be necessary to over  constrain the ckm quark  mixing matrix .",
    "an accurate measurement of @xmath1 in @xmath24 decays is of particular importance as the extracted phase is robust against new physics contributions , thus providing a standard model reference against which other measurements can be compared .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath1 comes from the interference of @xmath25 and @xmath26 quark transitions .",
    "the weak phase between these two transitions is @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitudes are related by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 has a value around 0.1 and is the absolute amplitude ratio , and @xmath30 is the strong  phase difference .",
    "sensitivity to @xmath1 is obtained by comparing the four separate decay rates involving @xmath20 and @xmath31 , and the two possible @xmath32 final states .",
    "this method is directly analogous to the ads method  @xcite , originally proposed to exploit cabibbo  favored ( cf ) and doubly  cabibbo  suppressed ( dcs ) decays such as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , rather than the scs modes under consideration here . in the case of decays to multi ",
    "body flavor specific final states it is necessary to take into account that the amplitude ratio of @xmath16  and @xmath14  and the strong  phase difference will vary over phase space .",
    "rate equations for different final states are given by  @xcite    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are defined as : @xmath40    here , @xmath41 is the amplitude for @xmath0 at a point in multi ",
    "body phase space described by the square of the invariant mass of the @xmath42 and @xmath33 pairs , ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 respectively , and @xmath45 .",
    "analogous equations can be written for the decays @xmath46  and @xmath47  and the coherence factors and average strong  phase differences for these final states have already been measured  @xcite .",
    "one difference between the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 modes and the  mode is that the value @xmath39 is approximately ten times larger than the corresponding parameters for the other decays .",
    "the larger value for @xmath39 occurs because both final states occur via scs transitions , while in the case of the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 decay modes one transition is cf and the other dcs .",
    "the larger value of @xmath51 means that the per  event sensitivity to @xmath1 from the @xmath16  decays [ eq .  ( [ eq : gamfav ] ) ] is increased in comparison to @xmath52 decays , while the per  event sensitivity to @xmath1 from the @xmath14  decays [ eq .  ( [ eq : gamsup ] ) ] is reduced in comparison to @xmath53 decays .",
    "the overall sensitivity to @xmath1 remains significant if the coherence is large .",
    "therefore knowledge of the coherence factor in @xmath19 decays is valuable , as it enables these channels to be added to the set of modes with which @xmath1 can be measured using @xmath17 decays .",
    "the coherence factor and average strong  phase difference are also valuable for time ",
    "dependent charm  mixing measurements as described in  @xcite .    in a region around a resonance that is prominent in both decays ,",
    "the coherence is expected to be close to one . a measurement in a bin of the dalitz plot around such a resonance is therefore also useful as the higher coherence improves the per  event sensitivity in measurements to determine @xmath1 .",
    "in the case of @xmath54 decays a prominent intermediate resonance is the @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , in this paper the measurement of the coherence factor and the average strong  phase difference is performed for both an unrestricted kinematic region and also for events where the @xmath55 invariant mass is within 100  of the nominal @xmath11 mass  @xcite .",
    "the value of 100  corresponds approximately to twice the natural width of the @xmath56 meson .",
    "in addition to the measurement of the coherence factor and average strong  phase difference , two further studies are also presented .",
    "first , there is the determination of the isobar models for the two decays . these can be used to test the predictions of su(3)flavor symmetry in charm meson decays , in particular the relative amplitudes and phases of the modes @xmath57 and @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the isobar models are used to estimate systematic uncertainties for the other measurements presented here and will also be of use as an input to simulation when performing future measurements that exploit @xmath19 decays .",
    "secondly , the ratio of the branching fractions for the suppressed with respect to the favored decay , @xmath59@xmath14@xmath15/@xmath13@xmath16@xmath15 , is measured .",
    "the current world average is 0.79 @xmath8 0.19  @xcite , and a more accurate determination is possible using cleo data .",
    "this is valuable as a better measurement of allows for a corresponding improvement in the knowledge of @xmath39 , which is an important input to the coherence factor analysis , and also to measurements of @xmath1 and studies of charm mixing .",
    "the isobar model studies are based on data collected both at @xmath60  and from charm mesons produced in the continuum at higher energies ; the branching ratio measurement exploits only the latter sample .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
