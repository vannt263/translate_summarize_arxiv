    "resonances occur in a variety of fields of physical sciences . despite their diversity ,",
    "they are characterized by two parameters , the resonance energy position and width , apart from the coupling with the background continuum represented by the fano profile@xcite .",
    "a great deal of discussions have been given to the interpretation of resonance phenomena@xcite .",
    "the most familiar parameterization of the resonances is condensed into the dispersion formula due to breit and wigner .",
    "back in 1939 , siegert @xcite developed a compact mathematical viewpoint for characterizing resonances as singular points of the dispersion relation .",
    "his idea requires the solution of the schrdinger equation subject to the outgoing wave boundary condition , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the radius beyond which the potential energy is negligible . the solution @xmath3 is called the siegert state  ( ss ) and it behaves like @xmath4 near @xmath5 and beyond .",
    "this boundary condition destroys the hermiticity of the hamiltonian , thus entailing complex - valued eigenenergies , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath6 this is a most direct representation of both the resonance position and width .",
    "this mathematically appealing representation had been implemented with tedious iterations due to lack of suitable computational techniques until tolstikhin _ et al _ @xcite made a breakthrough by introducing siegert pseudostates ( sps ) for the one - threshold case .",
    "their idea incorporates the boundary condition into the schrdinger equation so that the dispersion relation is obtained by a single diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "previous applications of sps to resonances in three - body coulomb problems indicate that it is not only a valid procedure but also a new perspective for the sps representation of resonances and decay processes @xcite .",
    "another immediate application of the sps theory is to the time - dependent problem@xcite where the reflection off the exterior boundary incurs numerical instability .",
    "tanabe and watanabe  @xcite succeeded in describing the reflectionless time propagation based on the siegert pseudostates .",
    "indeed , applied to the half - cycle optical pulses , the siegert boundary condition indeed was seen to eliminate the outgoing wave component perfectly .",
    "recently , sitnikov and tolstikhin @xcite stretched the scope of the sps theory by enabling the treatment of the two - threshold problem . despite such progress",
    ", there remains in the theory of sps a chapter still incompletely worked out .",
    "this is the siegert perturbation theory .",
    "a pioneering work on this subject is due to more@xcite who extended the siegert state theory specifically to handle the decaying state .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to complete the siegert perturbation theory from the recently developed sps viewpoint for both one- and two - threshold cases . particularly , in the one - threshold case , we are able to reconstruct more s theory for decaying states  @xcite in terms of sps but with an unexpected amendment to his theory .",
    "the sps perturbation theory  ( spspt ) is by no means straightforward owing to the non - standard orthonormality of the eigenfunctions .",
    "this constraint also serves to fix the phase of the perturbed wavefunction , a feature which is absent from the standard perturbation theory .",
    "it is hoped this paper serves to expose such noteworthy features of the spspt .",
    "this paper is thus constructed as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : review ] , we review some basic ideas about the sps as needed for an elementary presentation of the perturbation theory .",
    "section  [ sect : pt ] gives the details of the spspt for both one- and two - threshold cases . and",
    "section  [ sect : pt ] deals with a specific mathematical model as an example of the spspt .",
    "atomic units are used throughout .",
    "since the two - threshold sps theory contains the one - threshold case in itself , we review the two - threshold case only , leaving the one - threshold case as the limit where the two - thresholds become degenerate  @xcite .",
    "suppose first that there are as many as @xmath7 independent channels .",
    "the schrdinger equation reads @xmath8\\phi(r)=0 , \\label{eq:2ch}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 pertains to the potential energy of channel @xmath11 , and @xmath12 represents the interchannel coupling between channels @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "we consider the situation where there are only two energetically distinct thresholds so that we separate @xmath10 into two groups .",
    "a first group contains channels @xmath14 and they converge to @xmath15 as @xmath16 while the other group contains channels @xmath17 and they converge to @xmath18 , that is @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the two constants representing the threshold energies .",
    "this allows us to use the _ 2-channel _ sps scheme even in the presence of _ more than two channels_. the two channel momenta are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the boundary conditions are thus @xmath24 at @xmath25 and @xmath26 at @xmath5 where @xmath27 for the first group , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for the second group , @xmath30 .",
    "now , consider to expand the wavefunction @xmath31 by a complete orthonormal basis set @xmath32 over @xmath33 $ ] such that @xmath34 substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq:2ch ] ) , and integrating over the interval @xmath35 $ ] , we obtain the @xmath36-dimensional eigen value problem , @xmath37\\vec c=0 , \\label{eq:2ch - mat}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2ch - mat ] ) , @xmath42 is an @xmath43-dimensional unit matrix .",
    "the eigen system eq .  ( [ eq:2ch - mat ] ) involves a pair of eigenvalues , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which may be rewritten as a standard eigenvalue equation for a single variable @xmath46 according to the following heuristic procedure .",
    "let us note that energy @xmath47 can be represented by both @xmath44 and @xmath45 , namely @xmath48 so that @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( here , we assume @xmath51 for simplicity . ) since the product of linearly independent combinations of @xmath44 and @xmath45 becomes constant , we require @xmath52 to satisfy the following conditions , @xmath53 thus , @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 this procedure of replacing a pair of variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 by a single variable @xmath46 is called uniformization .",
    "the uniformization described above reduces eq .",
    "( [ eq:2ch - mat ] ) to @xmath57 with @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 by introducing a new vector @xmath61 the non - linear eigenvalue problem , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tse2ch ] ) , is reduced to a linear one such that @xmath62 furthermore , the above equation is symmetrizable as follows , @xmath63 let us refer to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tse2ch ] ) , ( [ eq : tse-2ch-2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : tse-2ch-3 ] ) as the tolstikhin - siegert equations ( tses ) .",
    "let us formulate the perturbation theory as appropriate for the sps whose orthonormality relation is different from the standard one . relegating the one - threshold case to the next subsection",
    ", we treat the general two - threshold case .",
    "we assume the perturbing potential energy @xmath64 vanishes beyond @xmath5 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath65 the tse for the @xmath66-th state including perturbing potential energy reads @xmath67 where @xmath68 differentiating eq .",

    "( [ eq : ptb ] ) using eq .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) , namely , @xmath79 so that @xmath80 the spectral representation of @xmath81is given by @xmath82 ( see eq . ( 59 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) using the relations @xmath83 ( see eqs .",

    "this freedom is not warranted in the present case .",
    "finally , we have the perturbation formulas for the two - threshold sps ,    @xmath89      it is important to clarify the relationship between one- and two - threshold cases . in the following ,",
    "we prove that perturbation formulas for the one - threshold case are obtained when we implement a limit of @xmath90 . in this limit , the following scaling clarified in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath91 reduces the two - threshold tse to a one - threshold one , namely , @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this scaling corresponds to the solution @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k1andk2 ] ) when @xmath97 .",
    "note that the solution @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k1andk2 ] ) is unphysical since the degenerate threshold here means the equivalence of asymptotic wavefunctions in this limit .",
    "thus , the scaling leads us to the perturbation formulas for the one - threshold case , namely @xmath99 note that the summation runs over the branch of @xmath96 , that is only over a half of the full non - degenerate space .",
    "these correspond to the sps representation of more s formulas@xcite .",
    "our expressions for the first - order eigenvector and for the second - order eigenenergy are different from his@xcite .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy has been traced to an algebraic error in more s derivation of the first - order wavefunction .",
    "( one necessary term is unfortunately dropped during his derivation . ) as a result of this , an extra term is restored in either formula . here",
    ", one important difference from the standard perturbation theory is that no hermitian conjugates appear in these formulas .",
    "this might suggest at first that there would remain phase ambiguity .",
    "however , any _ ad hoc _ additive phase would instead mar the orthogonality relation , that is what is the relative phase in the standard theory is fixed in the sps theory , thus leaving no ambiguity with the phase of eigen functions .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to see the consistency of the orthonormality relation and the siegert boundary condition for the particular case of @xmath100 .",
    "this verification is worked out in appendix .      ) .",
    "solid lines : adiabatic potential energies .",
    "this system supports three resonances :  shape type  ( a ) in channel 1 , feshbach type  ( b ) and shape type  ( c ) in channel 2.,width=264,height=264 ]    let us present an example of the perturbation theory for the two - threshold case .",
    "we revisit the 2-channel model potential with two thresholds that is taken up in ref .",
    "i.e. _ @xmath101 the potential @xmath102 supports three resonances .",
    "the adiabatic potential energy curve of the first channel supports one shape type resonance  ( a ) while the other channel supports one feshbach type  ( b ) and one shape type  ( c ) resonance .",
    "these resonances are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",

    "are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "let us call these results as _ direct numerical solutions_. to implement perturbation calculations , we separate @xmath102 into @xmath103 where @xmath104 we regard @xmath105 as the unperturbed potential energy and @xmath106 as the perturbation potential energy . we calculate perturbation energies using the unperturbed solutions of tse for the same box size @xmath107 as in ref .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the results of first- and second - order perturbation calculations , and figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2]-[fig : fig4 ] depict how the numerical solutions converge in the complex plane . in the present model problem",
    ", the first - order resonance energy agrees with the direct numerical solutions to about 2 to 4 digits while the width agrees to about 2 to 3 digits .",
    "and the second - oder resonance energy agrees to about 3 to 5 digits while the width agrees to about 1 to 3 digits .",
    "an important fact which we must remark is that the resonance energy and width do not appear to converge in pace .",
    "for instance , the width of resonance `` c '' evaluated by the second - order perturbation theory appears less accurate than the first - order one while the resonance energy appears to have improved .",
    "the seeming deterioration of the width is a little overwhelming , all the more so for the improvement of the resonance energy .",
    "nonetheless , the distance between the second - order result and the direct numerical one becomes rather small ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ) in the complex plane , that is in the siegert state perturbation theory the convergence is to be measured with respect to the variance @xmath108 rather than with respect to the real and imaginary parts of the sum , individually .",
