    "this paper is the second of a series devoted to the investigation of the internal and structural properties of field early - type galaxies ( e / s0 ) at intermediate redshift ( @xmath6 ) , and of the properties of their stellar populations . in particular ,",
    "the aim of this series of papers is to investigate how empirical scaling laws such as the fundamental plane ( fp ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al.1987 ) and the kormendy ( 1977 ) relation evolve with redshift .",
    "these studies are complemented with the measurement of metallicity and age of stellar populations by means of the lick / ids absorption lines indeces ( trager et al .  1998 ) .",
    "for this project we have collected high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra at intermediate resolution ( resolving power @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the full width half maximum resolution ) for a well - defined sample of field early - type galaxies in the redshift range @xmath9 . the sample is selected from images obtained with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) taken from the hst - archive .    the motivations of the project and the first results of this study have been discussed discussed in the paper presenting the analysis of the pilot sample ( treu et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter t99 ) . in this paper , we describe in detail the selection of a larger sample of 35 objects , and we present the surface photometry and the kinematic spectroscopic measurements . an extended discussion of the state of the art in this research area and of the objectives of our work is given in a companion paper ( treu et al .",
    "2001 , submitted to mnras ; hereafter piii ) , where the evolution of the fundamental plane and kormendy relation is analyzed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sample selection criteria and the characteristics of the sample are discussed in section [ sec : sample ] . in section [ sec : photo ] , we report on the measurement of the photometric parameters . the measurement of redshifts and central velocity dispersions is described in section [ sec : spec ] .",
    "the caveats of the photometric and kinematic measurements are extensively discussed . in particular , we discuss : _",
    "i ) _ the accuracy that can be achieved in measuring the combination of photometric observables that enters the fundamental plane ; _ ii ) _ the effects of resolution on the measurement of internal velocity dispersion , by means of montecarlo simulations ; _ iii ) _ the stability of the measured internal velocity dispersion with respect to the rest frame spectral region used for the fit .",
    "a summary is given in section  [ sec : sampdisc ] .",
    "the hubble constant is assumed to be h@xmath10 km  @xmath11mpc@xmath12 .",
    "the matter density of the universe and the cosmological constant in dimesionless form are indicated as @xmath13 an @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the targets used in this study have been chosen from a sample of random early - type galaxies ( e / s0 ) found in the wfpc2 parallel images collected by the medium deep survey ( griffiths et al .",
    "the medium deep survey consists of a database of 250 wfpc2 fields with at least 1 image in each of the filters f606w and f814w , which broadly correspond to johnson - cousins filters v and i ; we refer to these filters as v@xmath15 and i@xmath16 .",
    "the images have been reduced and analyzed by the mds group and the complete catalog is available to the scientific community ( ratnatunga , griffiths & ostrander 1999 ) .    for the sample selection we used the following criteria :    1 .   * morphology clearly defined as early - type*. we selected the galaxies classified by the mds as pure bulges or disc plus bulge objects with bulge - to - total luminosity ( b / t ) greater than 0.3 ( the mds group considers @xmath17 and exponential luminosity profiles , indicating them as bulge and disc luminosity profile respectively ; see the mds publications for details ) .",
    "all galaxies were inspected by eye to check their morphology and some of them were rejected as mis - identifications ( stars or galaxies with clearly present spiral structure ) .",
    "we did not exclude from the sample galaxies with nearby companions or disturbed galaxies , in order not to bias against merging and interaction .",
    "* sufficiently high luminosity * : ( i@xmath16  @xmath18 ) , which is the effective limit with efosc2 at the eso-3.6 m with the adopted grism # 9 in normally good seeing conditions ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "3 .   * high galactic latitude * : ( @xmath20 ) , to limit foreground star contamination and galactic extinction .",
    "* low extinction * : ( @xmath21 ) , as measured by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) , to reduce the possibility of photometric errors due to patchy reddening .",
    "appropriate colour * : ( @xmath22  v@xmath15-i@xmath16  @xmath23 ) , which is the entire range spanned by e / s0 in the approximate redshift range @xmath24 .",
    "* clustering properties*. parallel images are taken at random pointings within a few arcminutes of the primary target .",
    "therefore , when the primary target is a known cluster , the parallel image can also contain part of the cluster . in order to avoid such contamination , and to obtain an unbiased field sample ,",
    "images centred on known clusters were discarded from the analysis .      apart from the natural requirements on the magnitude limit and the limits on galactic latitude and foreground extinction , some selection criteria deserve a thorough discussion .",
    "in fact , understanding the selection criteria is a crucial step for a meaningful interpretation of the data ( e.g. , see the discussion in schade et al .",
    "1999 on morphology and colour selection criteria ) .    * morphological selection*. we checked our morphological selection criterion ( b / t  @xmath25 ) by studying the distribution of b / t values for the galaxies morphologically classified as early - type by abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . by matching absolute coordinates ,",
    "we cross - correlated the mds and abraham et al .",
    "catalogs down to i@xmath16  @xmath26 recovering the b / t value assigned by the mds to each galaxy visually classified as an early - type by abraham et al .  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the distribution of b / t values found by the mds group is plotted in figure  [ fig : a2mds ] .",
    "we conclude that our threshold in b / t does not exclude _ a priori _ any significant part of the early - type galaxy population .",
    "* colour selection*. our experimental setup was tuned to work in the redshift range @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we chose very loose colour cuts that at the same time could reject e / s0 outside our target redshift range ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) and include the widest range of stellar population properties . the colour - redshift relation for our sample",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : colorz ] .",
    "it is noticed that at any given redshift there are objects with early - type morphology that are significantly bluer than the reddest ones .",
    "the effect of the adopted colour selection criterion on the study of the evolution of stellar populations is discussed in piii .    * clustering properties*. we did not attempt to identify and to exclude members of groups or poor clusters .",
    "in fact , four of the six objects for which we have obtained fp parameters in t99 are likely to be members of a group ( or a poor cluster ) .",
    "hence , the early - type galaxies in our sample should be representative of a random pointing , magnitude - selected , sample of objects .",
    "we took spectra of 25 galaxies satisfying the adopted colour and magnitude selection criteria . for 22 of them",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio achieved is sufficient to measure accurate velocity dispersions ( see section  [ sec : spec ] ) . by rotating the slit on the sky",
    ", we observed spectra for 10 additional early - type galaxies as secondary targets . for 6 secondary early - type galaxies",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio achieved is sufficient to measure velocity dispersions .",
    "the redshift has been measured for all the 35 galaxies for which we present photometry .    in section  [ sec : spec ] , where we are mostly interested in discussing the measurement of velocity dispersions",
    ", we will consider all the galaxies including the secondary targets . in turn , when analyzing the results of this study in terms of evolution of the stellar populations of e / s0 ( as in piii ) , we will consider only the galaxies satisfying the adopted selection criteria .",
    "table  [ tab : obj ] lists the observed objects ( the digit in the adopted name indicates the observing run when the spectra were taken , see section  [ sec : spec ] ) with their coordinates and mds identification .",
    "the objects are flagged to indicate whether they satisfy all the selection criteria ( sel=2 ) , all criteria except that they are fainter than the limit i@xmath16  @xmath29 ( sel=1 ) , or they are added only as the best secondary target in the field ( sel=0 ) .",
    "for some of the objects the mds photometry was not available ( galaxy * d3 * is not considered by the mds group because it is close to the edge of the combined frame used , see table  [ tab : phlog ] ; sel = nn ) , or was not reliable ( chip edge for galaxy * q3 * , dust lane for galaxy * f3 * ; sel=-1 ) .",
    "for easy reference table  [ tab : obj ] also lists for each object the number of spectroscopic observations , the total spectroscopic integration times , the s / n achieved , and the redshift of the object .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is intuitive and well known ( e.g. bender 1990 ; jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1995 ; t99 ) that the s / n needed to measure velocity dispersions properly scales with the ratio between the instrumental resolution and the velocity dispersion itself .",
    "in other words , when the velocity dispersion is smaller than the instrumental resolution a higher minimum signal - to - noise is needed with respect to the case when the velocity dispersion is larger than the instrumental resolution .    in practice , for any given s / n and resolution , there is a lower limit on the velocity dispersion measurable without introducing significant bias ( for example , bender 1990 considers half of the instrumental resolution to be the minimum measurable value ) .",
    "quantitatively , these numbers depend on the instrumental setup ( resolution , sampling ) .",
    "therefore , we addressed the problem by numerical simulation of our measurement procedure . for a range of values of velocity dispersions ( @xmath30 , 75 ,  100 ,  125 ,  150 ,  175 ,  200 km  @xmath11 ) and of s / n ( 10 ,  12 ,  15 ,  18 ,  25 )",
    ", we created 1000 toy galaxy spectra with artificial noise and our instrumental sampling and resolution .",
    "we then recovered the velocity dispersion with the ghff software .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : restest ] .",
    "for each input value of @xmath31 we plot the average recovered @xmath32 as a function of s / n , using the same stellar spectrum as `` galaxy '' and template ( g8 iii ; panel a ) or using a different star as template ( g9 iii ; panel c ) .",
    "it is noticed that the smallest values of @xmath31 are systematically underestimated by the fit for low values of s / n ( by as much as 13 per cent for @xmath30  km  @xmath11 and @xmath33 ) but for @xmath34 km  @xmath11 the effect becomes negligible ( @xmath35 per cent at @xmath33 , @xmath36 per cent at @xmath37 for @xmath38 km  @xmath11 and using a different template ) . if  instead of the average of @xmath32 ",
    "the average of the logarithm of @xmath32 weighted on the formal variance is used as estimator ( jrgensen et al .",
    "1995 ) , the effect is reversed : the velocity dispersion is now overestimated for small values of @xmath31 ( by up to 15 per cent at @xmath30 km  @xmath11and @xmath33 ) .",
    "in addition , high values of @xmath31 ( from 200  km  @xmath11 in our simulation ) become underestimated by 2 per cent at @xmath33 .",
    "the conclusion is that the systematic uncertainty on small values of s / n is hard to correct , so that it is suggested that these data should be rejected . in our particular case",
    "we will only accept for measurement spectra with @xmath39 ( thus rejecting * f1 , b3 , f3 * ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : restest ] we also plot the relative scatter around the mean for the same configurations ( template g8 iii , panel b ; template g9 iii , panel d ) . for a given s / n the uncertainty on the velocity dispersion increases dramatically for the smallest values of @xmath31 , while it tends to become constant for velocity dispersions much larger than the resolution .",
    "this is consistent with what we find for galaxies * b4 * and * e3 * ( @xmath40  @xmath41 and 98 km  @xmath11 ) : despite the good s /",
    "n of the spectrum the formal uncertainty on @xmath31 is @xmath42 and @xmath43 per cent .",
    "we do not consider these values to be successfully measured .",
    "similarly , the small value of velocity dispersion of galaxy * b1 * was rejected in t99",
    ".    since most of the objects at @xmath44 have high s / n spectra , the problems discussed above are negligible . nevertheless",
    ", the uncertainty in the jhc spectral library resolution ( @xmath45 km  @xmath11 at 5000  ) can cause systematic effects on the low velocity dispersion objects .",
    "we ran extensive simulations ( as above ) to measure this effect . for velocity dispersions smaller than the resolution of the library ,",
    "the uncertainty is important ( for example @xmath46 per cent at 100 km  @xmath11 with @xmath47 ) , but it drops quickly with increasing velocity dispersion ( 6 per cent at 125 km  @xmath11 with @xmath47 ; 4 per cent at 150 km  @xmath11 ) . in practice , at @xmath48 km",
    "@xmath11 this effect is already smaller than the typical uncertainty",
    ". we will not consider galaxies * d2 , q3 , e4 * as successfully measured because their velocity dispersion is smaller than this limit .",
    "the uncertainty in the measurement of the instrumental resolution of efosc ( @xmath49 ) introduces a systematic error in the measurement of the velocity dispersion that is negligible in our case .",
    "for example , let us consider * a1 * , the galaxy with the highest signal - to - noise spectrum .",
    "the random error is estimated to be 6 per cent , the systematic error due to template mismatches is 7 per cent ; therefore , the additional 3 per cent associated with the uncertainty in the measurement of instrumental resolution , to be added in quadrature , does not change the total error significantly . as a check , we repeated the fits with templates broadened to the resolution changed by a standard deviation . for galaxy",
    "* i1 * we obtained the largest difference ( 7 km  @xmath11 ) , still negligible with respect to the other sources of error .",
    "the effect on the uncertainty on the resolution of efosc2 is smaller and totally negligible .",
    "the spectra of galaxies * d1 , e2 , f2 , g3 , i3 , l3 , m3 , r3 , s3 , u3 , d4 , h4 , * and * i4 * include the lines ca h and k. as noted in t99 , even though widely used to perform such measurements ( dressler 1979 ) , these lines have been reported to induce a slight overestimate of the velocity dispersion ( kormendy 1982 ; see also kormendy & illingworth 1982 ) .",
    "kormendy & illingworth ( 1982 ) suggest that the problem may be caused by the intrinsic width of the lines or by the steepness of the continuum in that spectral region .",
    "however , dressler ( 1984 ) suggests that they may be best suited for the measurement of large velocity dispersions for faint objects , such as * d1*. for these reasons , we performed the kinematic fit also by masking the region of ca h and k. in figure  [ fig : cahk ] the variation of @xmath32 as a function of velocity dispersion and s / n is plotted .",
    "the velocity dispersion obtained with ca h and k , as listed in table  [ tab : kineres ] , is on average 1.4 per cent higher than the one obtained by masking this region , with a 6.6 per cent scatter .",
    "the effect is within the estimated error and the scatter is likely to be induced by the loss of information caused by masking a significant part of the spectrum .",
    "we conclude that with this kind of resolution , sampling , signal - to - noise ratio , and treatment of the continuum , the presence of ca h and k does not alter significantly the measurement of velocity dispersion .",
    "similarly , the spectra of * a1 , c3 , t3 * , and * a4 * include the region of nad , which may be affected by interstellar absorption even in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. dressler 1984 ) .",
    "we repeated the analysis by excluding the nad region ( see figure  [ fig : nad ] ) and found an average velocity dispersion higher by 2.3 per cent .",
    "as above , we conclude that the presence of nad in the spectrum does not alter significantly the result , and used in table  [ tab : kineres ] the values found by using the entire spectral range .",
    "the total error on the redshift , taking into account the error on wavelength calibration , is less than 0.0005 , when the ghff fit was performed and less than 0.002 in the cases where the redshift has been measured by identifying the main spectral features .",
    "spatially resolved kinematics measurements in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , capaccioli et al .",
    "1993 ; carollo & danziger 1994a , b ; bertin et al.1994 ) have shown that the velocity dispersion varies ( generally it declines ) with radius . for this reason ,",
    "central velocity dispersion is generally different from the velocity dispersion measured from the spectrum integrated over the entire galaxy , as is generally available at intermediate redshift .",
    "a correction is thus required .",
    "as in t99 , we model the velocity dispersion profile with a power law , @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "the desired correction can be computed numerically from @xmath52 here we have assumed that the value obtained by measuring @xmath53 within an aperture @xmath54 is the average of @xmath55 weighted by the luminosity density , modelled as an @xmath17law appropriately normalized and indicated by @xmath56 . with respect to t99 , the way we compute the correction has been improved by taking into account the effect of seeing . the effect of seeing is to smear the dependence of the correction on @xmath57 , whenever the two quantities are comparable .",
    "we computed the correcting factor @xmath58@xmath40 to an equivalent aperture of radius @xmath59 ( see jrgensen et al .",
    "1995 ; t99 ) for a range of values of seeing ( @xmath60 ) , effective radius ( 0@xmath61 ) , and number of lines used .",
    "the average correcting factor , computed as @xmath62/2 $ ] , ranges from 1.055 to 1.075 .",
    "the uncertainty related to the intrinsic variety of velocity dispersion profiles ( modelled by @xmath63 ) is larger than this interval .",
    "therefore , we adopt the mean correcting factor @xmath64 , where the error is estimated as @xmath65/2\\sqrt{3}$ ] as in t99 .",
    "the values obtained for the central velocity dispersion are shown in figures  [ fig : spec1 ] and  [ fig : spec2 ] together with the spectrum of each galaxy .",
    "the instrumental response was measured at the beginning and at the end of every night , by observing spectrophotometric standard stars at parallactic angle through a @xmath66 slit .",
    "the response was stable from night to night within 2 - 3 per cent over the entire spectral range when the same star was used for calibration .",
    "different stars provided similar responses within 5   per cent .",
    "we used the average response function to correct the spectra .",
    "we estimate the relative flux calibration uncertainty to be @xmath67 per cent , dominated by the systematic differences found when different stars are used .",
    "in this paper we have presented the surface photometry and spectroscopy of a sample of hst selected early - type galaxies .",
    "the sample is chosen mainly based on morphology and colour .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : sample ] , our sample is a fair sample of the early - type galaxies found in the medium deep survey , with respect to morphological selection , colour distribution , bulge - to - total luminosity distribution , and luminosity distribution . as already noticed by other authors ( see , e.g. , totani & yoshii 1998 ) , at any given redshift early - type galaxies span a significant range of colours , from the red envelope of old cluster ellipticals bluewards ( figure  [ fig : colorz ] ) .",
    "in section [ sec : photo ] we have presented the surface photometry of 35 objects in the redshift range @xmath68 ( see figure  [ fig : histoz ] ) .",
    "the photometric structural parameters ( effective radius and effective surface brightness ) have been derived with two different techniques : isophote profile fitting ( @xmath17and @xmath17 + exponential disc ) and 2 dimensional fitting ( @xmath17only ) .",
    "the value of the structural parameters changes significantly ( r.m.s scatter of 15 per cent in @xmath57 ) with the different modelling , but the combination of effective radius and surface brightness that enters the fp is remarkably stable ( r.m.s .",
    "scatter 0.03 ) .    in section",
    "[ sec : spec ] we have described spectroscopic measurements obtained at the eso-3.6 m telescope .",
    "redshifts are obtained for all the 35 objects with measured surface photometry . using montecarlo simulations ,",
    "we have studied extensively the systematic errors in the measurement of @xmath32 , due to instrumental resolution and finite s / n .",
    "the systematic errors are found to be significant for values of @xmath32 comparable to the instrumental resolution and for small s / n",
    ". based on these simulations , we measure velocity dispersion only on the 28 spectra with average s /",
    "n per pixel larger than 12 , and we reject all values of @xmath69  km  @xmath11 . in the end , we have obtained robust determination of velocity dispersion for 22 galaxies .",
    "a range of stellar templates is used to recover the internal velocity dispersion ; the best - fitting template is found to span the entire range g4-k0 iii . in this way",
    ", we are able to investigate the systematic errors induced by the mismatch between the galactic stellar population and the stellar template used .",
    "the average error on internal velocity dispersion is found to be 8 per cent ( plus 5 per cent systematic ) .",
    "no significant offset in the average velocity dispersion is found when ca h and k and nad lines are masked in the kinematic fit .",
    "this work is based on observations collected at the european southern observatory ( la silla ) under programmes 62.o-0592 , 63.o-0468 , and 64.o-0281 and with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",

    "<S> the average random error on the central velocity dispersion is found to be 8 per cent and the average systematic error due to template mismatch is found to be 5 per cent . </S>",
    "<S> the errors on velocity dispersion measurement and the effects of template mismatches are studied by means of extensive montecarlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we investigate whether the determination of the velocity dispersion is sensitive to the spectral range used , finding that the value of velocity dispersion is unchanged when the spectral regions that include the absorption features ca hk and nad are masked out during the fit .    </S>",
