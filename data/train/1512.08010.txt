    "the principal goal of statistical mechanics is to extract pertinent features from the complete microscopic information contained in trajectories of microscopic particles composing macroscopic systems under consideration .",
    "the pertinent features are those seen in mesoscopic and macroscopic experimental observations .",
    "we look for a reduced ( mesoscopic ) time evolution which concentrates only on the pertinent features and ignores the irrelevant details .",
    "the reduction process from the micro to the meso dynamics ( consisting of three steps , ( i ) finding microscopic trajectories , ( ii ) extracting from them the pertinent pattern , and ( iii ) constructing mesoscopic dynamics whose trajectories reproduce the pattern ) is , in general , very complex .",
    "it is therefore very useful to realize that the microscopic , the mesoscopic , and the macroscopic time evolutions share a common structure , namely that the reversible evolution is expressed by means of a poisson bracket and energy , see @xcite .",
    "the two latter references introduce the general equation for non - equilibrium reversible - irreversible coupling ( generic ) .",
    "the generic framework contains a large amount of mesoscopic models , e.g. classical hydrodynamics , boltzmann equation , classical irreversible thermodynamics ( cit ) , extended irreversible thermodynamics ( eit ) , see @xcite , models for polymer flows , visco - elasto - plastic solids @xcite , etc .",
    "the main features of generic are that the reversible part of the evolution equations is constructed from a poisson bracket while the irreversible from a dissipation potential ( or dissipative bracket when thermodynamic forces are small ) , and that the equations are also automatically compatible with equilibrium thermodynamics as they gradually approach equilibrium .",
    "the hamiltonian structure of reversible evolution is common to a large class of models in continuum physics on many levels of description , see also @xcite , and we shall thus require that passages from levels with more details to levels with less details preserve the structure .",
    "in this paper we focus on relations between hamiltonian structures governing reversible evolution on different levels of description .",
    "this means that on the level of the microscopic dynamics of all particles composing macroscopic systems we consider the complete dynamics but on mesoscopic levels we consider only a part of the dynamics - the reversible part .",
    "for example , on the level of fluid mechanics , we consider only the euler part and on the level of kinetic theory only the free flow without collisions .",
    "moreover , we investigate only the poisson brackets of the hamiltonian structures , not the energy functionals .",
    "our goal is to construct poisson brackets as reductions of a known poisson bracket expressing kinematics on a more detailed ( more microscopic ) level .",
    "for example , we can start on the liouville level , i.e. on the level on which n - particle distribution functions serve as state variables .",
    "the time evolution on the liouville level , governed by the liouville equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , is hamiltonian and reversible time evolution .",
    "the right hand side of the liouville equation ( liouville vector field ) is gradient of energy transformed into a vector by the liouville - poisson structure ( expressed mathematically in the liouville - poisson bracket - see sec .",
    "[ sec.pb.liouville ] ) .",
    "projections from the n - particle distributions to lower ( less detailed ) levels of description then induce projections of the liouville poisson bracket to poisson brackets on the lower levels .",
    "the method of projection that we employ is quite natural and was already used for example in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present it in its full generality within the context of non - equilibrium thermodynamics and investigate its geometric interpretation in appendices and electronic supplementary ( es ) .",
    "we also employ it to develop new levels suitable for applications in the theory of turbulence .",
    "various reductions demonstrated in this paper are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.map ] .",
    "it sometimes happens that reversible evolution is not given by projection of the liouville poisson bracket , as for example in an eit theory of mixtures and bbgky hierarchy ( see sec .",
    "[ sec.out ] ) .",
    "what is then the common structure shared by the reversible evolution on different levels of description ?",
    "in general this question still remains an open problem in non - equilibrium thermodynamics as it is not for example clear whether validity of jacobi identity is necessary when the reversible evolution is accompanied by an irreversible counterpart .",
    "in particular examples , for example the bbgky hierarchy , the common structure is again the poisson bracket as the terms containing higher - order distribution functions can be replaced by a constitutive relation ( closure ) while the rest remains hamiltonian .",
    "that is how the boltzmann collision term comes into play while the reversible part of boltzmann equation is hamiltonian .",
    "the bbgky hierarchy however is not part of the present hierarchy of poisson brackets .",
    "it is thus still unclear whether the hamiltonian structure should be a necessary feature of all consistent reversible dynamics describing real physical systems compatible with non - equilibrium thermodynamics or not , but even if it is , the poisson bracket can be out of the present hierarchy of poisson brackets .    when starting from the n - particle liouville poisson bracket , the number of particles is inherently incorporated into the poisson brackets .",
    "to remove this dependence , we develop a grand - canonical hierarchy of poisson brackets in sec .",
    "[ sec.gce ] .",
    "this hierarchy can be then reduced to a two - point kinetic theory or to a poisson bracket coupling hydrodynamic fields with a conformation tensor , reynolds stress and non - local vorticity .",
    "such an extended hydrodynamics should be useful in modeling of fluids where non - local effect play an important flow , e.g. in turbulence .",
    "contribution of this paper can be seen in the following points .",
    "firstly , the natural hierarchy of poisson brackets generated by projections from n - particle distribution functions to less detailed levels of description is investigated in the context of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "various thermodynamically relevant models are shown to be part of the hierarchy .",
    "some of the projections seem to be novel ( e.g. the passages to mixtures or to the symmetric distribution functions).this systematic treatment of poisson brackets should serve as a ( so far lacking ) guide for constructing poisson brackets within the theory of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "secondly , a new hierarchy of non - local poisson brackets is suggested , namely the grand - canonical ensemble hierarchy .",
    "this hierarchy leads to a two - point kinetic theory and to a poisson bracket of extended hydrodynamics with applications in turbulent fluid motions , polymeric fluids , colloidal systems and other mesoscopic systems .",
    "thirdly , some of the projections are rewritten as the duals of some certain lie algebra homomorphisms in the appendices , which should be interesting from the geometrical point of view .",
    "the most detailed description of a physical system seen as composed of classical particles is given by hamilton s canonical equations or equivalently , in the liouville representation , by the liouville equation , which describes the time evolution of the n - particle distribution function .",
    "the liouville level of description , where n - particle distribution function is the state variable , is the highest ( most detailed ) level of description and we thus start on this level .",
    "the hamiltonian structure of liouville equation is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec.pb.liouville ]",
    ". then we shall observe in sec .",
    "[ pb.sec.b ] how the poisson bracket generating the reversible part of boltzmann equation can be obtained from the poisson bracket generating liouville equation by projecting the n - particle distribution function to a one - particle distribution function .",
    "this passage is then interpreted geometrically in sec .",

    "consider an isolated system consisting of @xmath0 interacting particles .",
    "the corresponding phase space consists of positions and momenta of all particles .",
    "position and momentum of the first particle is denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , and analogously for other particles .",
    "the couple @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 for convenience and analogically for the other particles .",
    "evolution equation of the n - particle phase space density @xmath5 , or n - particle distribution function , is the standard liouville equation , see e.g. @xcite , @xmath6 where the n - particle hamiltonian @xmath7 is a real - valued function of the position coordinates and momenta , that has the physical interpretation of the energy of the system .",
    "the liouville equation is usually derived within non - equilibrium statistical physics from the requirement that probability density behaves as an incompressible ideal fluid .",
    "note , however , that there is also an elegant geometric derivation exploiting properties of the coadjoint action of the group of canonical transformations on the cotangent bundle of classical mechanics , see [ sec.lb.groups ] .",
    "energy on the liouville level , @xmath8 , can be expressed as @xmath9 since @xmath10 eq .",
    "implies that an arbitrary functional @xmath11 of the distribution function evolves as @xmath12 where the poisson bracket on the liouville level ( or the liouville - poisson bracket ) is equal to @xmath13 note the usage of einstein s summation convention over matching upper and lower indexes .",

    "the liouville - poisson bracket will serve as a starting point for derivations of less detailed poisson brackets .",
    "boltzmann equation consists of both reversible and irreversible dynamics .",
    "let us now derive the reversible part from the liouville - poisson bracket , .",
    "one - particle distribution function ( or one - particle phase space density ) @xmath24 , evolution of which is described by boltzmann equation , can be defined as a projection of the n - particle distribution function .",

    "see @xcite for detailed calculation .",
    "this last equation is exactly the poisson bracket that generates the reversible part of the boltzmann equation , referred to as the boltzmann - poisson bracket , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we have thus obtained that @xmath40 for functionals @xmath20 , @xmath41 dependent only but only through the function @xmath32 . ] on the one - particle distribution function @xmath32 .    in summary , starting with functionals dependent only on the one - particle distribution function , @xmath32 , the liouville poisson bracket becomes the boltzmann poisson bracket .",
    "in other words , the reversible evolution governed by the boltzmann equation is just a `` projection '' of the reversible evolution governed by the liouville equation .",
    "let us make this statement more rigorous .",
    "each poisson bracket can be interpreted in terms of the corresponding poisson bivector field as @xmath42 see e.g. @xcite .",
    "note that the indexes can be discrete or continuous ( in which case the summation becomes integration ) and that the derivatives are to be considered as functional derivatives .",
    "what is the relation between the poisson bivector on the liouville level of description and the poisson bivector on the boltzmann level ?",
    "the boltzmann - poisson bracket can be expressed in terms of its poisson bivector as follows @xmath43 and analogically the poisson bivector generating the liouville poisson bracket is defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the component of the liouville poisson bivector that provides coupling between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "now from eq .",
    "it follows that @xmath49 which is the relation between the poisson bivectors on the liouville and boltzmann levels .",
    "let us now have a look at relation from the geometrical point of view .",
    "consider the manifold of state variables on a higher level of description ( e.g. liouville ) , and denote the state variables by @xmath50 . on a lower level of description the state variables ( denoted by @xmath51 )",
    "are obtained by a projection @xmath52 poisson bivectors are twice contravariant antisymmetric tensors , and thus the projection transforms them formally as follows , see e.g. @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the lower- and higher - level poisson bivectors , respectively .",
    "formula is a particular realization of this last equation .",
    "the projection , however , does not need to be well defined , which is the reason for the word `` formally '' , commented on later on .    in summary",
    ", obtaining the poisson bracket on a lower level of description by evaluating the poisson bracket on a higher level on functionals dependent only on state variables of the lower level is equivalent to projecting the poisson bivector from the higher level of description to the lower level .",
    "moreover , components of the poisson bivector on the lower level of description are given by poisson bracket on the higher level applied on components of the projector .",
    "the liouville - poisson bracket generates reversible evolution in the sense of time - reversal transformation , see @xcite .",
    "are the brackets derived from a reversible poisson bracket also reversible ?",
    "consider state variables with definite parities with respect to the time - reversal transformation ( trt ) , which simply inverts velocities of all particles , see @xcite , i.e. @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote parity of variable @xmath50 and the action of trt on the variable , respectively .",
    "note that trt satisfies @xmath59 as this is in fact the definition of trt action on the more macroscopic level ( and hence we do not distinguish the two distinct trt mappings on the lower and higher level of description ) . additionally , the commutation relation yields @xmath60 and as @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we have @xmath63    suppose , moreover , that the poisson bracket on the higher level of description generates reversible evolution ( as for example the liouville poisson bracket does ) , which means that @xmath64 as shown in @xcite .",
    "the poisson bivector at the lower level evaluated at inverted coordinates ( i.e. after application of trt ) becomes @xmath65 which means that any poisson bivector obtained by projection of a poisson bivector generating reversible evolution generates only reversible evolution as well .",
    "since the poisson bivector of classical mechanics or liouville equation generates reversible evolution , all the poisson bivectors ( or poisson brackets ) derived by the projection from the liouville poisson bivector generate only reversible evolution .",
    "let us now return to the word `` formally '' used when stating that the poisson bracket on the lower level is obtained by a projection .",
    "the projector @xmath66 is no diffeomorphism , and thus the push - forward mapping bivectors on @xmath67 to bivectors on @xmath0 does not exist in general , see @xcite , and without providing any additional knowledge about the system under consideration there is no a priori guarantee that the result of the projection is well defined .",
    "an example of the additional knowledge that ensures possibility of the projection is a symmetry permitting a symplectic or poisson reduction , see @xcite or @xcite . if , on the other hand , the result of the projection given by eq . only depends on state variables of the lower level , @xmath68 , the projection is well defined and one may use it as the poisson bivector on the lower level .",
    "the explicit calculation of the poisson bivector ( or poisson bracket ) on the lower level of description has to be carried out anyway and so the checking whether it only depends on state variables of the lower level does not bring any additional computational effort .",
    "but is the jacobi identity guaranteed for the result of the projection ?",
    "firstly , consider smooth functions on @xmath67 , @xmath69 , which are also referred to as the algebra of observables on @xmath67 .",
    "functions from @xmath69 indeed form an ( associative ) algebra , since they form a linear space and the standard pointwise multiplication is the bilinear operation necessary for @xmath69 to be an algebra . moreover ,",
    "poisson bracket of two functions from @xmath69 stays in @xmath69 and so @xmath69 is even a lie algebra , referred to as an algebra of observables , see @xcite .",
    "secondly , consider functions on @xmath67 that are projectable onto @xmath0 , @xmath70 functions @xmath71 form an algebra isomorphic to the algebra of functions on @xmath0 , @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , there is a bijective mapping between @xmath71 and @xmath72 which respects the bilinear operation ( pointwise multiplication ) given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "so far we have shown that @xmath71 is an algebra isomorphic with @xmath72 .",
    "let us now introduce a poisson structure inherited from the algebra of observables @xmath69 so that @xmath71 also becomes an algebra of observables .",
    "consider two functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 from @xmath71 and define their poisson bracket as @xmath78 does this expression give a function from @xmath71 ?",
    "not in general since one has to check that the poisson bivector on the lower level of description , @xmath79 , does not depend on @xmath80 but only on @xmath68 .",
    "note , however , that such calculation has to be carried out anyway when one wishes to express the tensor explicitly .",
    "but when the resulting bivector field only depends on state variables @xmath68 , the expression @xmath81 indeed is in @xmath71 , and due to the properties of the poisson bracket @xmath82 ( antisymmetry , jacobi identity ) the @xmath83 is indeed a poisson bracket .",
    "since @xmath71 and @xmath72 are isomorphic , the poisson bracket works on @xmath72 as well , and we have obtained an algebra of observables @xmath72 with the poisson bracket @xmath83 inherited from @xmath69 . the expression for the poisson bracket on the lower level of description and the expression for the new poisson bivector are exactly the same as in the illustration demonstrating projection from the liouville level to the boltzmann level as well as in all other illustrations of the procedure in this paper , and so one does not need to check whether the derived brackets really are poisson brackets ( fulfilling antisymmetry and jacobi identity ) because that is satisfied automatically when the projection can proceed ( the resulting poisson bivector depends only on the @xmath68 variables ) .    in summary , it has been shown that when starting with a poisson bracket generating reversible evolution on a higher level of description , there is a natural way to construct a poisson bracket on a lower level of description .",
    "the new poisson bracket indeed satisfies all the properties of poisson brackets , and it generates only reversible evolution . the passage to the lower level",
    "is given by defining a projection from state variables on the higher level to state variables on the lower level . during the passage one",
    "has to check that the constructed poisson bivector depends only on the state variables of the lower level . if this is true , the passage is complete and the dynamics on the lower level is derived from the reversible dynamics on the higher level , it is reversible , and the poisson bracket indeed fulfills all the necessary properties ( antisymmetry and jacobi identity ) .",
    "note that reversible evolution on a lower level of description is often derived from the liouville equation by means of statistical physics , see @xcite .",
    "for instance , turkington @xcite recently developed an optimization procedure leading from liouville equation to generic , and the poisson bracket is given by eq . .",
    "therefore , the way poisson brackets are constructed in this manuscript is compatible with the way they are constructed from liouville equation in statistical physics .      in the following subsections",
    "we shall provide some particular illustrations of the above geometric approach .",
    "consequently , all the listed levels of descriptions can be regarded as tightly linked one to another and all consistently derived from the first principles . later in the text",
    "we also show examples that are outside of this unification theory and propose a generalization for certain situations .      having derived the boltzmann - poisson bracket in sec .",
    "[ pb.sec.b ] , we are able to derive the hydrodynamic poisson bracket in a convenient way .",
    "one could , of course , start with the liouville poisson bracket and go directly to hydrodynamics , but the calculation would be longer than when starting from the boltzmann poisson bracket .",
    "let us , therefore , introduce the projection from the boltzmann level of description to the level of classical hydrodynamics .",
    "the hydrodynamic state variables are density , momentum density and entropy density    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is mass of one particle and entropy density @xmath86 is a positive smooth real - valued function of the distribution function .",
    "therefore , derivatives of the hydrodynamic state variables with respect to @xmath87 are    [ pb.eq.chder ] @xmath88",
    "@xmath89    let us now construct the hydrodynamic poisson bracket . plugging eq . into the boltzmann - poisson bracket ,",

    "term can be rewritten as    @xmath91    which constitutes the first two terms of the final hydrodynamic poisson bracket .",
    "term becomes @xmath92 where the first term following the equality sign is the last term of the hydrodynamic poisson bracket .",
    "all the other terms will cancel with the remaining terms of .",

    "finally , term can be rewritten as @xmath94 by integration by parts .    in summary",
    ", all the terms that remain from bracket form the poisson bracket of classical hydrodynamics , @xmath95 see also @xcite , @xcite or appendix of @xcite , where the calculations needed to pass from the boltzmann poisson bracket to the hydrodynamic bracket are made somewhat differently .",
    "consider now that there are particles of two different species in the isolated system .",
    "their positions and momenta are denoted by @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the overall @xmath98-particle distribution function , which evolves according to liouville equation , is denoted by @xmath99 .",
    "one - particle distribution functions of the two species are then defined by the following projections .",

    "[ pb.sec.b ] , these two poisson brackets are equal to the boltzmann poisson brackets constructed from @xmath21 and @xmath105 , respectively . consequently , the poisson bracket governing reversible evolution of two one - particle distribution functions is @xmath106 where the latter bracket is the boltzmann - poisson bracket with @xmath107 instead of @xmath32 .",
    "poisson bracket of binary hydrodynamics , where the each of the fluids is described by its density , momentum density and entropy density , can be obtained from the binary boltzmann - poisson bracket straightforwardly .",
    "the projection is as follows :    [ pb.eq.bh.state ] @xmath108    consider now two functionals dependent only on these state variables .",
    "poisson bracket does not provide coupling between the two different species .",
    "therefore , the bracket applied to the two functionals consists of two parts , each of which is obtained the same way as the hydrodynamic poisson bracket was obtained from boltzmann poisson bracket . therefore , the poisson bracket describing evolution of state variables is @xmath109 where the latter poisson bracket is the standard hydrodynamic poisson bracket but with state variables - .    in summary ,",
    "a binary mixture with state variables evolves according to poisson bracket , which is simply the sum of hydrodynamic poisson brackets , one for each species .",
    "note that this description of binary mixtures typically represents mixtures with different temperatures ( as in cold plasma , where electrons have different temperature than ions , see @xcite ) . indeed , as there are two entropies , there are also two temperatures ( derivatives of the entropies with respect to energy ) .",
    "let us approach an even lower level of description , where only densities , total momentum , and total entropy density constitute the state variables .",
    "the projection is then given by    @xmath110    this level of description is quite important since it is the level where classical irreversible thermodynamics ( cit ) , see @xcite or @xcite , takes place .",
    "indeed , the state variables are the same as within cit .",
    "note that the cit poisson bracket was already introduced in @xcite using dirac constraints .",
    "the following derivation can be regarded as a shortcut to the poisson bracket .",
    "derivatives of a functional dependent only on @xmath111 are then @xmath112 plugging these relations into bracket yields the cit poisson bracket , @xmath113    taking energy equal to @xmath114 where internal energy density @xmath115 is just a real - valued function of the state variables , the evolution equations become    @xmath116    where pressure is expressed in terms of state variables through @xmath117 which is clearly equivalent to the reversible part of cit evolution equation , see e.g. @xcite . in other words , it has been shown how the reversible part of evolution within cit can be derived by projection from the liouville equation .",
    "one could also continue in the reduction to a lower level , where only the total density @xmath118 total momentum @xmath119 and total entropy @xmath120 are present .",
    "this is an alternative ( and longer ) way to obtain the classical hydrodynamic poisson bracket .",
    "furthermore , one could project the total momentum to a constant .",
    "this is the passage to the level of mechanical equilibrium introduced for example in @xcite .",
    "the poisson bracket , however , completely disappears during the passage , since the cit poisson bivector does not provide coupling between densities and total entropy , which are the only state variables that remain on the level of mechanical equilibrium .      hitherto , we have not required the n - particle distribution functions to be symmetric with respect to permutations of particles .",
    "since , however , elementary particles are indistinguishable , let us pass to the distribution functions symmetric with respect to permutations of particles .",
    "the symmetric distribution function is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes permutations of labels @xmath123 .",
    "the liouville - poisson bracket , eq .",
    ", then becomes ( details in es ) @xmath124 which is the poisson bracket for symmetric @xmath125-particle distribution functions .",
    "the poisson bivector indeed only depends on @xmath126 , and thus the projection to symmetric distributions defines a lie algebra .    the above procedure can be also seen in a more geometric way by regarding relations between the lie algebras of n - and - one - particle distribution functions as shown in es . regarding also irreversible evolution , which is not described by the poisson bracket , one could seek for a dissipation potential such that loss of particle identity is revealed as an irreversible process .",
    "such evolution would then lead from the non - symmetric n - particle distribution function to the symmetric counterpart .    in summary , symmetrization provides passage between the level of general n - particle distribution functions , governed by liouville - poisson bracket , and the level of symmetric n - particle distributions , governed by the liouville poisson - bracket with @xmath126 instead of @xmath21 .",
    "let us refer to the level of description where only symmetric n - particle distributions constitute the state variables as to the symmetric liouville level ( ls ) .",
    "let us analyze a level of description between binary hydrodynamics and cit , where only one ( the total ) entropy density is defined .",
    "this situation corresponds to an extended irreversible thermodynamic ( eit ) level within mixture theory as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the projection is given by    @xmath127    and a total entropy density relation of which to binary hydrodynamic variables @xmath128 is to be identified .",
    "motivation for the unknown function @xmath129 lies in the work @xcite , where it has been identified as minus the kinetic energy of diffusion over temperature .",
    "let us denote the vector of binary hydrodynamics variables as @xmath130 and the eit variables as @xmath131 .",
    "the detailed calculations , that can be found in es , lead to the conclusion that the discussed eit theory of mixtures is out of the hierarchy of poisson brackets .",
    "although it does not mean that the theory is incompatible with generic , as there still might be a poisson bracket governing reversible evolution of the theory , it seems to be rather problematic to construct such a poisson bracket .",
    "the difficult task is to couple two momenta and with only one entropy which thus has to be convected by the two momenta , most likely leading to violation of jacobi identity . on the other hand ,",
    "even if it turns out that there is no poisson bracket expressing reversible evolution in the theory of mixtures , the theory may be regarded as an useful approximation of the two - entropy ( two - temperature ) setting .",
    "indeed , it was shown in paper @xcite that the entropy - less part of the poisson bracket of binary hydrodynamics generates reversible evolution in the theory of mixtures in the isothermal case .",
    "the symmetric liouville level can be rewritten in terms of the whole bbgky hierarchy @xcite , and the hierarchy thus acquires hamiltonian structure as shown in @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to consider all the levels of the bbgky hierarchy at once .",
    "for example the evolution equation of the two - particle level of bbgky contains also a contribution from the three - particle distribution function , etc .",
    "it is shown in es that the projection from symmetric liouville distribution functions to only one - and - two - particle distribution functions does not yield a poisson bracket . only the projection from symmetric liouville distribution functions to one - particle distribution functions , given by eq .",
    ", provides a poisson bracket , see [ sec.lb.groups ] for more details , where the geometric reason is identified .",
    "note that the projection forms a lie algebra only in case of the boltzmann equation , i.e. when projecting only to the one - particle distribution functions , since then no interactions between particles play a role .",
    "indeed , even in the classical bbgky hierarchy evolution equations of distribution functions depend on higher - order distribution functions via interactions between particles ( interaction part of hamiltonian ) , but when no interaction is present , the evolution equations become closed .",
    "this does not mean , however , that boltzmann equation does not describe systems with interactions , see e.g. @xcite .    according to the explicit calculation in es , the projection from liouville level to two - point bbgky is not preserving the poisson structure , in other words",
    ", the projection is not a poisson map .",
    "it is possible to observe the obstruction on the projection being poisson in a pure algebraic way , see remark [ remark.l.2bbgky ] in [ sec.gce.groups ] .",
    "the standard liouville equation describes evolution of a fixed number of indistinguishable particles .",
    "it is possible to formulate analogical evolution when the number of particles is not fixed ?",
    "a similar question is resolved in equilibrium statistical physics when passing from canonical ensemble to grand - canonical ensemble , see e.g. @xcite or @xcite and in the quantum field theory , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the passage is interpreted by gibbs as taking an ensemble of systems with different numbers of particles instead of only one .",
    "motivated by this observation , a grand - canonical ensemble ( gce ) hierarchy has been introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to review and further develop the gce hierarchy .",
    "consider isolated systems consisting of @xmath132 particles , which have all the same volume .",
    "each of the systems evolves according to the one- , two- , three- , etc .",
    "particle symmetric liouville equation , respectively , and the evolution is expressed by the corresponding symmetric grand - canonical distribution functions .",
    "for example , the average number of particles , average energy and average entropy can be expressed as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a @xmath135particle hamiltonian @xmath136 and @xmath137 stands for a real - valued concave function of one variable .    in thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "the distribution functions are given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 , @xmath140 temperature , @xmath141 is planck constant , @xmath142 boltzmann constant , @xmath143 pressure , @xmath144 volume and @xmath145 chemical potential .",
    "the functions are normalized by @xmath146 see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the relation between the grand - canonical distribution functions and the symmetric liouville distribution functions is @xmath147 where the prefactor @xmath148 expresses the probability that there is @xmath125 particles in the system .",
    "let us now transform the grand - canonical distribution functions as suggested by melville green in @xcite .",
    "the transformation also appears naturally when regarding the lie algebra structure of the grand - canonical ensemble as discussed in [ sec.gce.groups ] .",
    "the new distribution functions are    [ eq.f.rho ] @xmath149    and analogically for higher @xmath125 .",
    "the average number of particles and the average energy thus become    [ eq.en.rho ] @xmath150    note that energy is now conveniently split into contribution from n - particle interactions instead of the n - particle hamiltonians , which simplifies the formula to great extent .",
    "such splitting can be regarded as a motivation for introducing the new distribution functions as can be seen for example in [ sec.gce.groups ] .",
    "transformation can be inverted as @xmath151 and that derivative with respect to @xmath152 of a functional dependent on @xmath153 is @xmath154    what is the physical meaning of transformation ?",
    "for example @xmath155 can be interpreted as the probability that there is a particle at position @xmath4 regardless of the overall number of particles in the system .",
    "similarly , @xmath156 can be interpreted as the probability that there are two particles at those two positions regardless the number of particles in the system . as we saw in the example of eqs . and , if a dependence of a functional on combinations of three or more particles can be neglected ( as in case of energy ) , the average of the functional can be expressed in terms of only @xmath157 and @xmath158 , which means that higher order distribution functions @xmath159 can be neglected .",
    "transformation can be seen as the transformation after which the total energy does not depend on @xmath160 and higher densities if there are only binary interactions present in the system .",
    "transformation thus makes it possible to express functionals in terms of only a few distribution functions .",
    "however , neglecting higher order distribution functions has to be seen as an approximation which keeps precise values of energy ( when considering only binary interactions ) and number of particles .",
    "the situation is quite similar to that in bbgky hierarchy , where it was shown in chapter 3.1.b of @xcite that macroscopic properties , namely the equation of state , are given by the first two distribution functions ( when considering only binary interactions ) . that then leads to the assumption that non - equilibrium evolution is then also expressed just in terms of the first two distribution functions as in chapter 7.1.a of @xcite . in the grand - canonical ensemble energy",
    "is expressed only in terms of @xmath157 and @xmath158 and thus the equilibrium values of these two distribution functions are sufficient to reconstruct the fundamental thermodynamic relation @xmath161 .",
    "that means , as well as in @xcite , that it is reasonable to formulate also non - equilibrium evolution just in terms of the two first distribution functions .",
    "moreover , the setting where only the first two distribution functions play the role of state variables is compatible with the pair - correlation formalism from @xcite .    on the other hand , neglecting higher - order distribution functions in the standard bbgky hierarchy , or neglecting higher @xmath162 distribution functions , is rather problematic , since lower - order distribution functions @xmath163 are integrals of higher - order distribution functions @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and thus all the distribution functions would become zero .",
    "this is no longer true about the distribution functions @xmath166 in the gce hierarchy , where higher - order distribution functions can be neglected without losing the lower - order distribution functions .",
    "formula together with the definition of @xmath167 give the equilibrium grand - canonical distribution functions , @xmath168 where interactions @xmath169 are not taken into account for simplicity .",
    "taking results from pages 83 and 84 of book @xcite , it can be shown that @xmath170 where @xmath0 is number of particles in the system .",
    "so in an ideal system ( without interactions ) distribution function @xmath158 can be neglected with respect to @xmath157 .",
    "it can be expected that if binary but not ternary interactions are present , distribution function @xmath160 can be neglected while working only with @xmath157 and @xmath158 , which is the case considered in this section .",
    "let us now turn to the evolution of the new distribution functions .",
    "consider all functionals of the following form @xmath171 where each @xmath172 depends only on @xmath152 .",
    "evolution of such distribution function @xmath152 is given by liouville equation because the prefactor in eq .",
    "does not depend on the actual positions of the particles , i.e. @xmath173 which implies that the functional @xmath172 evolves as @xmath174 functional @xmath20 introduced in then evolves as @xmath175 note that the second equality follows from the fact that @xmath163 and @xmath164 are not coupled by the poisson bracket when @xmath176 .",
    "finally , we can introduce a grand - canonical poisson bracket @xmath177 which governs evolution of functionals of type , and eq .",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath178 this bracket is indeed poisson as r.h.s . of this last equation",
    "is again of form and as the bracket fulfills jacobi identity ( liouville - poisson brackets fulfill the identity for all @xmath125 ) .",
    "functionals of form thus form a lie algebra with poisson bracket .    moreover ,",
    "restriction to functionals dependent only on @xmath152 , which is equivalent to projecting the set @xmath179 only to @xmath152 , yields the standard liouville equation .",
    "therefore , the algebra of functionals that depend only on n - particle distribution functions with the liouville - poisson bracket is a projection from the algebra of grand - canonical ensemble functionals .",
    "the gce hierarchy is thus a generalization of the hierarchy starting from the liouville equation in that sense .",
    "poisson bracket can be now expressed in terms of the new distribution functions @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath180 .",
    "neglecting all distribution functions except for @xmath157 and @xmath158 , the one - particle liouville - poisson bracket becomes @xmath181 where equations and were used .",
    "dots denote the same term as the preceding term inside the bracket but with @xmath20 and @xmath41 swapped .",
    "similarly , the two - particle liouville - poisson bracket is @xmath182 finally , bracket becomes , when neglecting @xmath160 and higher distribution functions , @xmath183 which is surely a poisson bracket as it can be seen as a transformation of poisson bracket @xmath184 expressed in distribution functions @xmath185 and @xmath186 to distribution functions @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",

    "and @xmath199 is the convective part of the bracket , @xmath200 the poisson bracket ( [ pbturb ] ) is closed within variables and thus generates the time evolution on the level of description given by the projection .",

    "our aim is to describe fluids with internal elastic degrees of freedom as polymeric fluids .",
    "such elastic interaction energy can be written as @xmath202 to maintain finite value of energy , it can be thus expected that the two - particle distribution function @xmath158 decays with increasing @xmath188 rapidly .",
    "an estimate of the decay can be found in es . finally , assuming that the fields do not vary appreciably over the decay distance supports validity of the truncation of the spatial taylor expansions .    in summary ,",
    "two grand - canonical two - point kinetic theory developed in sec .",
    "[ sec.gce ] can be projected to just a few moments of the distribution functions , namely the hydrodynamic moments and three weakly non - local tensors .",
    "reversible evolution of these new state variables is then described by a poisson bracket derived from the poisson bracket of the two - point kinetic theory by projection .",

    "the localization used when deriving poisson bracket is not employed here as we do not assume that @xmath207 does not vary appreciably over the decay distance of @xmath208 .",
    "when providing an appropriate energy functional @xmath209 , reversible part of evolution equations of the state variables can be obtained .",
    "the objective of this paper is to elucidate a method for projecting poisson brackets expressing kinematics on higher ( more detailed ) levels of description to poisson brackets expressing kinematics on lower ( less detailed ) levels in the context of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the method is quite natural and widely used in differential geometry .",
    "indeed , the new poisson brackets are obtained just by evaluating the original poisson bracket on projections of the original state variables onto the lower level state variables . the pertinence and implications of the method ( forming a hierarchy of poisson brackets ) in the physical context of non - equilibrium thermodynamics",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec.pb ] .",
    "this type of projections of poisson bracket is illustrated on two passages : ( i ) passage from the liouville - poisson bracket to the boltzmann - poisson bracket and subsequently to the hydrodynamic poisson bracket , and ( ii ) passage from the liouville - poisson bracket to the boltzmann - poisson bracket for a binary mixture and subsequently the poisson bracket of the classical irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the hierarchy of projections and poisson brackets investigated in this paper is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig.map ] .",
    "not all projections of state variables induce however projections of poisson brackets .",
    "for example , the projection from the liouville level to the levels that use one - point and two - point distribution functions as state variables ( the two - point part of the bbgky hierarchy ) leads to a poisson bracket that involves also the three - point distribution function .",
    "in other words , the bracket obtained after projection is not closed . in order to transform it into a bracket involving only the one - point and two - point distribution functions , we need to provide a closure , i.e. to express the three - point distribution function in terms of the one - and - two - point distribution functions .    similarly , the brackets arising in projections used to get the extended irreversible thermodynamics need closures .",
    "is there a way how to ensure that the resulting bracket will depend only on state variables of the lower level ( i.e. to ensure that we do not need to make any closures ) before calculating the projection explicitly ?",
    "the answer to this question is positive , but we have to know in addition the geometric structures of reversible dynamics on both more detailed and less detailed levels .",
    "for example , projection from the liouville - poisson bracket to the boltzmann - poisson bracket is ensured by the following geometrical argument .",
    "firstly , reversible dynamics on both levels can be regarded as generated by certain lie groups .",
    "secondly , lie algebras of the lie groups can be identified as n - particle and one - particle hamiltonians which implies a natural homomorphism between those lie algebras .",
    "thirdly , the mapping dual to the homomorphism relates the n - particle distribution functions and the one - particle distribution functions .",
    "this mapping then preserves the poisson bracket as it follows from differential geometry , e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore , the resulting bracket is guaranteed to be a poisson bracket .",
    "more details and examples are given in appendices of this paper .",
    "the applicability of the projection method can be extended by considering systems with variable contents , sec .",

    "this particular application provides a setting that appears to be suitable for modeling of turbulent flows as the hydrodynamic fields are coupled with tensors expressing weakly non - local behavior , the conformation tensor , reynolds stress tensor and non - local vorticity .",
    "a completely non - local poisson bracket coupling a spatial correlation function with the hydrodynamic fields is derived in sec .",
    "[ sec.g ] .    in summary",
    ", we have shown in this paper that kinematics of reversible evolution ( expressed in a poisson bracket ) can often be obtained as a simple projection of the poisson bracket expressing kinematics of the reversible time evolution on a higher level ( more detailed ) of description .",
    "one can for example start with liouville equation and project the liouville - poisson bracket to many poisson brackets describing evolution of less detailed descriptions , see fig .",

    "<S> the poisson brackets governing reversible evolution in one - particle kinetic theory , kinetic theory of binary mixtures , binary fluid mixtures , classical irreversible thermodynamics and classical hydrodynamics are derived from liouville equation . although the construction is quite natural , a few examples where it does not work are included ( e.g. the bbgky hierarchy ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a new infinite grand - canonical hierarchy of poisson brackets is proposed , which leads to poisson brackets expressing non - local phenomena such as turbulent motion or evolution of polymeric fluids . </S>",
