    "nuclear multifragmentation is presently intensely studied both theoretically and experimentally . due to the similitude existent between the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the van der waals forces , signs of a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter",
    "are searched . while the theoretical calculations concerning this problem started at the beginning of 1980 @xcite , the first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the aladin group @xcite . a wide plateau situated at around 5 mev temperature lasting from 3 to",
    "10 mev / nucleon excitation energy was identified .",
    "the fact was obviously associated with the possible existence of a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter and generated new motivations for further theoretical and experimental work .",
    "similar experiments of eos @xcite and indra @xcite followed shortly . using different reactions they obtained slightly different caloric curves , the plateau - like region being absent in the majority of cases .",
    "factors contributing to these discrepancies are both the precision of the experimental measurements and the finite - size effects of the caloric curve manifested through the dependency of the equilibrated sources [ @xmath5 sequence on the reaction type .",
    "concerning the first point of view , recent reevaluations of the aladin group concerning the kinetic energies of the emitted neutrons brought corrections of about 10 @xmath6 ( in the case of the reaction @xmath1au+@xmath1au , 600 mev / nucleon ) .",
    "more importantly however it was proven that the energies of the spectator parts are growing with approximately 30 @xmath6 in the bombarding energy interval 600 to 1000 mev / nucleon . on the other side , the universality of the quantity @xmath7 subject to",
    "the bombarding energy variation ( which was theoretically proven @xcite to be a signature of statistical equilibrium ) suggests that for the above - mentioned reactions the equilibrated sources sequence [ @xmath5 should be the same .",
    "consequently , we deal with an important nonequilibrium part included in the measured source excitation energies which may belong to both pre - equilibrium or pre - break - up stages @xcite .",
    "the smm calculations suggest a significant quantity of nonequilibrium energy even in the case of the 600 mev / nucleon bombarding energy reaction @xcite .",
    "thus , the necessity of accurate theoretical descriptions of the break - up stage and of the sequential secondary particle emission appears to be imperative in order to distinguish between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts of the measured excitation energies .",
    "these approaches should strictly obey the constrains of the physical system which , in the case of nuclear multifragmentation , are purely microcanonic .",
    "as we previously underlined @xcite , in spite of their success in reproducing some experimental data , the two widely used statistical multifragmentation models ( smm @xcite and mmmc @xcite ) are not strictly satisfying the microcanonical rules .",
    "the present paper describes some refinements and improvements brought to the sharp microcanonical multifragmentation model proposed in @xcite and also the employment of the model in its new version in the interpretation of the recent experimental data of the aladin group @xcite .",
    "the improvements brought to the model @xcite are presented in section ii .",
    "section iii presents the new evaluations of temperature curves and the first evaluations ( performed with this model ) of heat capacities at constant volume ( @xmath8 ) represented as a function of system excitation energy and temperature and also the comparison between the model predictions and the recent experimental heli isotopic temperature curve [ @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "the improvements brought to the microcanonical multifragmentation model concerns both the _ break - up _ stage and the _ secondary particle emission _ stage .",
    "+ ( i ) _ primary break - up refinements _ + comparing to the version of ref.@xcite the present model has the following new features : + ( a ) the experimental discrete energy levels are replacing the level density for fragments with @xmath10 ( in the previous version of the model a thomas fermi type level density formula was used for all particle excited states ) . in this respect , in the statistical weight of a configuration and the correction factor formulas @xcite the level density functions are replaced by the degeneracies of the discrete levels , @xmath11 ( here @xmath12 denotes the spin of the @xmath13th excited level ) . as a criterion for level selection ( i.e. the level life - time must be greater than the typical time of a fragmentation event ) we used @xmath14 1 mev , where @xmath15 is the width of the energy level . + ( b ) in the case of the fragments with @xmath16 the level density formula is modified as to take into account the strong decrease of the fragments excited states life - time ( reported to the standard duration of a fragmentation event ) with the increase of their excitation energy . to this aim the thomas fermi type formula @xcite is completed with the factor @xmath17 ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "+ ( ii ) _ inclusion of the secondary decay stage _ + for the @xmath22 nuclei it was observed that the fragments excitation energies are sufficiently small such as the sequential evaporation scheme is perfectly applicable . according to weisskopf theory @xcite ( extended as to account for particles larger than @xmath23 ) , the probability of emitting a particle @xmath24 from an excited nucleus is proportional to the quantity : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the stable excited states of the fragment @xmath24 subject to particle emission ( their upper limit is generally around 7 - 8 mev ) , @xmath27 is the kinetic energy of the formed pair in the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame , @xmath28 is the degeneracy of the level @xmath13 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the reduced mass of the pair and the separation energy of the particle @xmath24 and finally @xmath31 is the inverse reaction cross - section . due to the specificity of the multifragmentation calculations we considered the range of the emitted fragments @xmath24 up to the @xmath32 limit . for the inverse reaction cross - section we have used the optical model based parametrization from ref .",
    "the sequential evaporation process is simulated by means of standard monte carlo ( see for example @xcite ) .    for nuclei with @xmath33 ( the only excited states of @xmath34 nuclei taken into consideration are few states higher than 20 mev belonging to the @xmath23 particle ) depending on their amount of excitation we consider _ secondary break - up _ for @xmath35 and weisskopf evaporation otherwise ( here @xmath36 is the excitation energy of the fragment @xmath37 and @xmath38 is its binding energy ) .",
    "the microcanonical weight formulas have the usual form @xcite excepting the level density functions which are here replaced by the discrete levels degeneracies . due to the reduced dimensions of the @xmath39 systems ,",
    "the break - up channels are countable ( and a classical monte carlo simulation is appropriate ) when a mean field approach is used for the coulomb interaction energy . in this respect ,",
    "the wigner - seitz approach @xcite is employed for the coulomb interaction : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denotes the mass and the charge of the source nucleus , the resulting fragments have the index @xmath13 , @xmath43^{1/3}$ ] and @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 denotes the break - up volume and @xmath46 the volume of the nucleus at normal density",
    ". it should be added that @xmath47 is the radius of the source nucleus at break - up and @xmath48 is the radius of fragment @xmath13 at normal density .    for each event of the primary break - up simulation ,",
    "the entire chain of evaporation and secondary break - up events is monte carlo simulated .",
    "using the improved version of the microcanonical multifragmentation model , the caloric curves corresponding to two freeze - out radii ( r=2.25 a@xmath49 and r=2.50 a@xmath49 fm ) are reevaluated for the case of the source nucleus ( 70 , 32 ) ( the microcanonical caloric curves evaluated with the initial version of the model are given in ref .",
    "these are presented in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) . one can observe that the main features of the caloric curve from refs .",
    "@xcite are reobtained .",
    "thus , one can recognize the liquid - like region at the beginning of the caloric curve , then a large plateau - like region and finally the linearly increasing gas - like region .",
    "one may also notice that the caloric curve behavior at the freeze - out radius variation is maintained : the decrease of the freeze - out radius leads to a global lifting of the caloric curve .",
    "as it is well known , the curves of the constant volume heat capacity ( @xmath8 ) as a function of system excitation energy ( @xmath50 ) and as a function of temperature ( @xmath51 ) may provide important information concerning the transition region and the transition order .",
    "for this reason the curves @xmath52 and @xmath53 have been evaluated ( see fig .",
    "1 ( a ) and fig . 1 ( b ) ) .",
    "we remind that the constant volume heat capacity ( @xmath8 ) is calculable in the present model using the formula @xcite : @xmath54 ^ 2\\right>+t^2\\left<\\left(\\frac32 n_c- \\frac52\\right )      \\frac1{k^2}\\right>.\\ ] ] it can be observed that the @xmath52 curve has a sharp maximum around 4.5 mev / nucleon excitation energy for both considered freeze - out radii .",
    "this suggests that a phase transition exists in that region .",
    "the transition temperatures can be very well distinguished by analyzing the @xmath53 .",
    "one can observe two sharp - peaked maxima pointing the transition temperatures corresponding to the two considered freeze - out radii .    in order to make a direct comparison between the calculated heli isotopic temperature and the recent experimental results @xcite one has to deduce the sequence of excitation energy as a function of the system dimension [ @xmath5 . this is done as in refs .",
    "@xcite using as matching criterion the simultaneously reproduction of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 curves .",
    "this couple of curves can fairly well identify the dimension and the excitation of the equilibrated nuclear source @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 stands for the multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments and is defined as the number of fragments with @xmath57 from a fragmentation event while @xmath3 denotes the charge asymmetry of the two largest fragments and , for one fragmentation event is defined as @xmath58 with @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the maximum charge of a fragment and @xmath61 is the second largest charge of a fragment in the respective event .",
    "@xmath4 represents the _ bound charge _ in one fragmentation event and is defined as the sum of the charges of all fragments with @xmath62 .",
    "the simultaneous fit of the calculated curves @xmath55 and @xmath56 on the corresponding experimental data ( @xmath1au+@xmath1au at 1000 mev / nucleon ) is given in fig .",
    "the agreement is very good .",
    "the equilibrated source sequence [ @xmath5 we used for this purpose is given in fig .",
    "3 together with the experimental evaluations of the excitation energies as a function of source dimension for the reaction @xmath1au+@xmath1au at 600 , 800 and 1000 mev / nucleon .",
    "the theoretically obtained sequence is relatively close to the experimental line corresponding to 600 mev / nucleon bombarding energy .",
    "the deviations between the calculated equilibrated source sequence and the three experimental lines suggest that the experimental evaluations contain a quantity of non - equilibrium energy which grows with increasing the bombarding energy . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , its origin may be situated in both the pre - equilibrium and pre - break - up stage .",
    "these deviations are exclusively due to the neutron kinetic energies which , reevaluated @xcite from the 1995 data @xcite , are much larger .",
    "it should also be pointed that apart from the smm predictions @xcite , the quantity of non - equilibrium energy predicted by the present model is smaller and thus the model predicted equilibrated source sequence is closer to the experimental line of the 600 mev / nucleon bombarding energy reaction .    after evaluating the sequence of the equilibrated sources a direct comparison the heli calculated isotopic temperature curve with the ones recently evaluated by the aladin group @xcite is performed . to this purpose the uncorrected albergo temperature is used : @xmath63 $ ] , the experimental predictions being divided by @xmath64 ( which is the factor used in the aladin evaluation of the heli caloric curve chosen as to average the qsm , gemini and mmmc models predictions ) .",
    "the result is represented in fig .",
    "4 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "it can be observed that the agreement between the calculated @xmath65 and the experimental data corresponding to the @xmath1au+@xmath1au reaction at 600 and 1000 mev / nucleon bombarding energy is excellent on the entire range of @xmath4 . in comparison",
    ", the smm model predicts in the region @xmath66 a curve steeper than the experimental data .",
    "sumarizing , the microcanonical multifragmentation model from ref .",
    "@xcite is improved by refining the primary break - up part and by including the secondary particle emission .",
    "the caloric curve rededuced with the new version of the model preserves its general aspect @xcite manifesting an important plateau - like region .",
    "the transition regions are clearly indicated by the sharp maxima of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 curves .",
    "the model proves the ability of simultaneously fitting the `` definitory '' characteristics of the nuclear multifragmentation phenomenon @xmath55 and @xmath56 . evaluating the equilibrated source sequence @xmath67 [ by using the criterion of reproducing both @xmath68 and @xmath69 versus @xmath70 , a nonequilibrium part of the experimentally evaluated excitation energy growing with the increase of the bombarding energy",
    "is identified .",
    "the direct comparison of the calculated heli caloric curve shows an excellent agreement with the experimental heli curves recently evaluated by the aladin group .",
