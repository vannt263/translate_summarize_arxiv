    "the behavior of strongly interacting electrons confined to low spatial dimensions and driven out of equilibrium is still poorly understood .",
    "recent advances in the construction of small quantum dot devices have opened up the possibility of studying in a controlled way the nonequilibrium behavior of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "for instance the kondo effect , which was first observed in metals with dilute magnetic impurities@xcite , has now been seen in measurements of the conductance through a single - electron transistor@xcite ( set ) , in accord with theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "most experiments so far have focused on steady state transport through a quantum dot .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been developed to calculate electrical transport properties in a far from equilibrium situation .",
    "currents generated by a large static bias applied to the leads of a quantum dot in the kondo regime have been analyzed in some detail using the keldysh formalism combined with the non - crossing approximation ( nca)@xcite . remarkably , stationary currents may also be found exactly with the use of the bethe ansatz@xcite .",
    "exact treatments at special points in parameter space have also been carried out@xcite .",
    "more recently , attention has been paid to time - dependent phenomena in quantum many - body systems@xcite . by looking at the response of an interacting dot to a time - dependent potential ,",
    "plihal , langreth , and nordlander studied the several time scales associated with different electronic processes@xcite .",
    "the response to a sinusoidal ac potential@xcite in the kondo regime has been studied both in the low@xcite and high - frequency limits@xcite .",
    "nca has been the most commonly used approximation to obtain response currents due to an external applied pulse .",
    "the exact solution at the toulouse point corroborates many of the nca results@xcite .",
    "however , nca calculations have mostly focused on the kondo regime at not too low temperatures , because in the mixed - valence regime , or at low temperatures , nca is known to give spurious results @xcite . in practice nca has usually been limited to studies in the @xmath3 limit . for a typical set , the ratio of the coulomb repulsion in the dot to the dot - lead coupling strength ranges over @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "other numerical techniques , such as the numerical renormalization group , have also been used@xcite to calculate the conductance through dots . however , these methods seem to be limited to the static linear - response regime .",

    "physical electrons correspond to @xmath7 ( spin - up or spin - down ) .",
    "we will also have occasion to consider spinless electrons ( @xmath8 ) as this case permits a comparison with known exact results for noninteracting electrons .",
    "higher values of @xmath9 are of actual physical interest too , as these can occur when there are additional orbital and channel degeneracies .",
    "the model we study possesses a global su(n ) spin symmetry .    unlike nca ,",
    "the dynamical @xmath0 approach is systematic in the sense that it includes all feynman diagrams up through a given order in @xmath0 ; not only a certain class of them . as crossing diagrams are neglected in the nca it is of interest to compare the two approaches .",
    "the static version of the @xmath0 expansion is a type of configuration - interaction ( ci ) expansion of the sort familiar to quantum chemists .",
    "the dynamical 1/n approach has some similarities to a real - time perturbation scheme along the keldysh contour developed by knig@xcite .",
    "perturbing in the powers of the lead - dot coupling generates an increasing number of particle - hole excitations in the leads . in practice a resonant - tunneling approximation is implemented to restrict the set of diagrams to be considered . only single particle - hole excitations in the leads were included in the off - diagonal elements of the total density matrix , and the intra - dot coulomb repulsion @xmath10 was taken to be infinite .",
    "we determine the response currents through a quantum dot under the influence of both a small step bias , and a large pulse .",
    "transient oscillatory phenomena are found .",
    "in particular , a type of ringing in the current discovered previously for non - interacting electrons is recovered within the @xmath0 approach upon setting @xmath1 .",
    "we compare the behavior of the response current for spinning and spinless electrons , and demonstrate that the intradot coulomb interaction changes both the period of the oscillations and the decay rate of the currents .",
    "we further demonstrate that the period of the oscillations , in the case of spinning electrons , does not depend on the dot level energy when the dot level is moved from the kondo into the mixed valence regime , and thus extend previous results in the kondo regime based on nca@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce a generalized time - dependent newns - anderson model for describing a quantum dot and its systematic solution using a @xmath0 expansion of the many - body wavefunction . also we describe how non - zero temperature can be treated in the method and how observables are calculated . in section [ sec : step ] we find the current through a quantum dot for a small symmetric bias , deep in the linear response regime . in section",

    "the many - body wavefunction is constructed by systematically expanding the hilbert space into sectors with increasing number of particle - hole pairs in the leads .",

    "the division of the sector into two parts reflects the fact that the state produced by an electron hopping to the dot from a continuum level @xmath16 while another electron is excited from @xmath55 to @xmath53 can be distinguished ( because the electrons carry spin ) from the state in which @xmath16 and @xmath55 are interchanged .",
    "a similar decomposition is carried out for the sectors with two particle - hole pairs described by amplitudes @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we neglect , at o(@xmath43 ) , the sector corresponding to a singly - occupied dot with a hole and two particle - hole pairs as the amplitude for this sector has 5 continuum indices .",

    "we should also include sectors corresponding to a doubly - occupied quantum dot with one or two particle - hole pairs in addition to the two holes in the leads .",
    "however , as these configurations are described by amplitudes with up to 6 different continuum indices , and as the amplitudes for these sectors is small ( due to the repulsive coulomb interaction ) , the computational work required to include the amplitudes is excessive , and we drop them from the equations of motion .    the equations of motion for the amplitudes that appear in eq .",
    "[ o.psi ] are given in the appendix .",
    "we note that the terms we keep in the @xmath0 expansion is equivalent to summing up feynman diagrams , including the crossing ones , up to order @xmath43 .",
    "the inclusion of crossing diagrams is significant because it is these diagrams that are known to be responsible for the recovery of fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures@xcite , and the disappearance of the kondo effect in the spinless @xmath71 limit .",
    "we conclude our discussion of the dynamical @xmath0 method by explaining how observable quantities such as the currents are calculated . at zero temperatures , the initial state of the system prior to application of the bias",
    "is chosen to be the ground state , which is obtained by the power method . integrating the equations of motion forward in time",
    "then yields @xmath72 , and expectation values of observables , @xmath73 , are calculated periodically during the course of the time evolution : @xmath74 for the particulars of how to calculate the expectation value of the current operators , see the appendix .",
    "most of the results presented in the paper , with the exception of those shown in the final figure , are for the case of zero temperature . at non - zero temperatures",
    "we must extend the method@xcite .",
    "suppose that at an initial time @xmath75 , prior to application of the bias , we could find the complete set of energy eigenstates and values @xmath76 satisfying @xmath77 .",
    "each of these eigenstates could then be evolved forward in time yielding @xmath78 .",
    "the combined thermal and quantum average of any observable quantity , @xmath79 , would then be given at time @xmath80 by : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is as usual the partition function of the system .",
    "however , as the hilbert space is enormous in size , the determination of the whole set of time - evolved many - body wavefunctions is prohibitively difficult .",
    "instead we sample the hilbert space by creating a finite , random , set of wavefunctions : @xmath83 .",
    "the wavefunctions are generated by assigning random numbers to the amplitudes that describe the different sectors of the wavefunction , eq .",
    "[ o.psi ] .",
    "each of these randomly generated wavefunctions is then weighted by half of the usual boltzmann factor , @xmath84 and the resulting set of weighted wavefunctions is time - evolved to yield @xmath85 .",
    "( the wavefunctions are weighted by half the usual boltzmann factor so that thermal expectation values , which depend on the square of the wavefunctions , have the correct weight . )",
    "thermal averages of each observable such as the current are calculated periodically during the course of the integration forward in time : @xmath86 where @xmath87 at the very lowest temperatures only a single sample is needed as the approach then reduces to the zero - temperature power method described above . at non - zero but moderate temperatures , thermal averages over @xmath88 random wavefunctions",
    "suffice , and the convergence of the thermal average may be easily checked by increasing the number of samples .",
    "we stress that time dependence comes in only via the wavefunctions .",
    "this makes the present approach rather straightforward , avoiding cumbersome green s function formalisms based on the keldysh or kadanoff - baym techniques . on the other hand ,",
    "the approach is not useful at very high temperatures as an excessive number of samples is then required .",
    "we now present an intuitive picture of how electronic transitions take place as the current flows through the quantum dot .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows some of the sectors , up to o(1/@xmath89 ) , that contribute to the current through a dot subject to the rectangular pulse bias shown in fig .",
    "when the bias is switched on , electronic transitions between the dot and the leads take place .",
    "sectors shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in which an electron travels from the left to the right leads creating cross - lead particle - hole excitations make the most important contribution to the current .",
    "the current through the dot is a consequence of the formation of particle - hole pairs , with holes accumulating in one lead and particles in the other .",
    "sectors of the hilbert space with increasing numbers of particle - hole pairs , and hence higher order in @xmath0 , become populated as time goes on .",
    "electronic transitions back down to lower order sectors also occur , of course , since the hamiltonian is hermitian .",
    "however , because the phase space of sectors with increasing numbers of particle - hole pairs grows rapidly with the number of pairs , when the system is driven out - of - equilibrium , reverse processes back down to lower orders occur less frequently .",
    "this irreversibility may be quantified in terms of an increasing entropy@xcite .",
    "we first apply the dynamical @xmath0 approach to study the response of a quantum dot to a small , symmetric , step bias potential .",
    "we use parameters appropriate for a semiconducting quantum dot .",
    "we either take @xmath3 or , more realistically , set @xmath90 or @xmath91 mev comparable to the values reported by goldhaber - gordon _ et al .",
    "_ for the single electron transistor built on the surface of a gaas / algaas heterostructure that led to the reported kondo effect@xcite .",
    "we further set the dot - lead half - width to be @xmath92 mev , and @xmath93 .",
    "thus in the case of spinning electrons the dot is in the kondo regime . in a real set",
    "there are several quantized levels with a typical spacing of order @xmath94 mev .",
    "however , as mentioned in the previous section , here for simplicity we consider only the case of a single energy level in the dot . at time",
    "@xmath95 the bias on the left lead is suddenly turned on , raising the fermi energy by @xmath96 , while the right lead is shifted down by the opposite amount , -@xmath96 , and the dot level is held fixed . the size of the bias is chosen to be @xmath97 which is small enough to induce a linear response in the current .",
    "the leads are assumed to be described by a flat band of constant density of states with all energies taken to be relative to the fermi energy .",
    "the band is taken to be symmetrical about the fermi energy with a half - bandwidth set at @xmath98 mev .",
    "we use @xmath99 discrete levels both above , and below , the fermi energy in our calculations , except for the o(@xmath43 ) amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 . as these amplitudes each have four continuum indices , we retain only 10 levels above , and below , the fermi energy .",
    "this turns out to suffice as there is little change when only 5 levels are retained . to improve the discrete description",
    ", the continuum of electronic states in the conducting leads is sampled unevenly : the mesh is made finer near the fermi energy to account for particle - hole excitations of low energy . specifically , the discrete energy levels below the fermi energy are of the following form : @xmath100,\\ \\ \\ k = 1 , 2 , \\cdots , m\\\\ ] ] with a similar equation for levels above the fermi energy .",
    "thus , the spacing of the energy levels close to the fermi energy is reduced from the evenly spaced energy interval of @xmath101 by a factor of @xmath102 for a typical choice of the sampling parameter @xmath103 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath104 are likewise adjusted to compensate for the uneven sampling of the conducting levels@xcite .",
    "we note that the discretization of the continuum of electronic states in the leads means that we can only study pulses of duration less than a cutoff time : @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the level spacing close to the fermi energy of the conducting leads . as we show below , however , the @xmath0 expansion itself imposes a more severe restriction on the reliability of the method at long times .",
    "the case of spinless electrons deserves special attention as it provides a stringent test of the @xmath0 expansion , and is also exactly solvable . for an anderson impurity model at equilibrium",
    "it is known@xcite that the occupancy of the impurity at @xmath8 is accurate to within 1% of the exact result when terms in the wavefunction expansion are kept up through order @xmath43 . in the dynamical case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , however , we find that for @xmath93 the currents decay in time despite the fact that the bias remains turned on . insight into the breakdown of the dynamical @xmath0 expansion can be gleaned from the equilibrium problem as discussed by gunnarssson and schnhammer@xcite .",
    "they observe that the parameter range @xmath107 is an unfavorable one for the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the o(@xmath108 ) approximation in this limit differs qualitatively from the o(@xmath0 ) and o(@xmath43 ) approximations .",
    "in particular there is a large change in variational ground state energy ( 97% in the case of @xmath109 ) going from the o(@xmath108 ) to o(@xmath0 ) approximations .",
    "this compares to a change of only 18% in energy for the @xmath110 case . in the dynamical problem",
    "the observation likewise suggests that the case @xmath93 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is also unfavorable for the @xmath0 expansion as higher order sectors may be expected to contribute substantially to the wavefunction . by contrast the other @xmath8 case of @xmath110 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] exhibits a clear plateau in the currents .",
    "we interpret this behavior as follows : as the dot energy level is raised from @xmath93 to @xmath111 , the many - body wavefunction moves closer to the beginning `` root '' state of the hilbert space expansion , the state @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for which the dot level is empty .",
    "higher - order terms in the @xmath0 expansion are less important in this limit , and the expansion is more accurate .",
    "the limited number of particle - hole pairs retained in the @xmath0 expansion means that electron transfer from one lead to the other ceases when the higher order sectors become significantly populated .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the dynamical @xmath0 approach is limited to rather short times after the step in the bias is applied . inclusion of higher - order sectors in the @xmath0 expansion would presumably permit accurate time - evolution for longer times .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath63 sector for the case of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is quite small when the current starts to decay , consistent with the observation that the amplitude of the empty dot sectors ( first column in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) are small in comparison to the singly - occupied sectors ( second column of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , in the the kondo and mixed - valence regimes . including the o(@xmath43 ) sector consisting of two particle - holes in the leads ,",
    "an electron in the dot and an extra hole in the leads should improve the behavior of the current at longer times .",
    "however as a practical matter the rapid growth in computational complexity at high orders in the @xmath0 expansion prohibits extensions to arbitrarily high order .",
    "cluster expansions based upon exponentials of particle - hole creation operators@xcite may offer a way to obtain more satisfactory behavior at long times .",
    "physical electrons have spin , and since @xmath7 is a more favorable case from the standpoint of the @xmath0 expansion , we expect ( and find ) improved behavior . the coulomb repulsion @xmath10 reduces the size of higher - order corrections as it acts in part to suppress charge - transfer through the dot that leads to the formation of the particle - hole pairs .",
    "furthermore the kondo effect in the limit @xmath107 is recovered already at o(@xmath108 ) in the @xmath0 expansion . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for @xmath3 there is a strong enhancement in the current in comparison to the spinless case ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is as expected from the increase of spectral weight at the fermi level of the leads due to the kondo resonance .",
    "the current is further enhanced at finite @xmath90 mev .",
    "this can be understood from @xmath0 calculations of the spectral density at equilibrium .",
    "a decrease in @xmath10 results in an increase in the spectral weight at the fermi energy , reflecting a corresponding increase in the kondo energy scale ( see fig . 9 of ref . ) .",
    "the point is also illustrated by an analytical estimate of the kondo temperature for finite @xmath10 based on weak - coupling renormalization - group scaling@xcite : @xmath112 here @xmath113 is the half - width of the dot level due to its hybridization with both leads .",
    "this formula yields @xmath114k . as the weak - coupling expression eq .",
    "[ hal ] is only reliable at small values of @xmath10 , it likely overestimates the kondo temperature in the present case of @xmath115 .",
    "it is worth comparing the kondo temperature so obtained with the value extracted from the @xmath3 bethe - ansatz expression@xcite , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is euler s constant .",

    "[ ba ] gives only @xmath118 mk .    hence , the increase in the kondo temperature obtained from eqs . [ ba ] and [ hal ] as @xmath10 is decreased from infinite to finite values is consistent with the enhancement of the current shown in fig .",
    "we use eq .",
    "[ hal ] to estimate the kondo temperature at finite-@xmath10 in the following section .",
    "in this section we study the response of the quantum lead - dot - lead system to a large rectangular pulse bias potential , driving the system well beyond the linear response regime .",
    "as the response of the dot - lead system is highly non - linear , this situation is quite instructive .",
    "we again study both the @xmath8 and @xmath7 cases , and use the same values for @xmath119 and @xmath10 as in the previous section but with @xmath120 mev .",
    "the rectangular pulse bias potential is applied as follows . at time @xmath121 , a sudden upward shift of the bias with amplitude @xmath122 is applied to the left lead , leaving the dot energy level unchanged , and the right lead unbiased as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . at a later time",
    "@xmath123 the bias is turned off .",
    "the abrupt rise in the bias generates a ringing in the response currents as a result of coherent electronic transitions between electrons at the fermi energy in the leads and the dot level .",
    "the period of these oscillations was predicted to be@xcite : @xmath124 fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows , for the case @xmath93 , the response current between the left lead and the dot upon setting @xmath1 in the @xmath0 expansion . the oscillation period accords with eq .",

    "[ fig4 ] also shows the current for the case of interacting , spinning , electrons .",
    "note that oscillation period changes when interactions are turned on . as discussed in the next subsection , this is a consequence of the formation of kondo resonances at the fermi energy in each lead .",
    "it is remarkable that the @xmath0 approach reproduces , in the @xmath8 limit , the period of the oscillations expected from eq .",
    "[ period ] .",
    "unlike nca , the @xmath0 approach recovers the expected features of non - interacting electrons in the @xmath8 limit .",
    "in particular , many - body kondo resonances disappear@xcite at @xmath8 as they must .",
    "as mentioned above , the recovery of independent - particle physics can be attributed to the presence of crossing diagrams in the @xmath0 expansion .    also of interest",
    "is the duration of the initial response peak .",
    "the transient response time is shorter in the case of noninteracting spinless electrons .",
    "the transient response fades away more slowly because the repulsive coulomb interaction inhibits electron motion through the dot .",
    "in equilibrium it is well known that a kondo resonance can form at the fermi energy of the leads . for the steady state case of constant bias potential",
    ", previous nca calculations of spectral density predicted the splitting of the kondo peak@xcite into two resonances , one at the fermi energy of each lead .",
    "the situation studied here is different as we analyze the response to a short pulse rather than the steady state behavior .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior is still consistent with the split kondo peak picture .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that the response current does not obey eq .",
    "[ period ] . instead the current oscillates with a period that is independent of @xmath119 , and depends only on the bias .",

    "[ fig6 ] also demonstrates that the period of the oscillations remains nearly constant as the energy of the quantum dot level is varied from @xmath126 ( mixed - valence regime ) to @xmath127 ( kondo regime ) .",
    "large biases split the kondo peak in two , and the resulting many - body resonances are separated by energy @xmath122 .",
    "electronic transitions between these two peaks induce oscillations of period @xmath125 .",
    "the @xmath0 calculation agrees qualitatively with the nca calculation of plihal , langreth , and nordlander@xcite",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show that the split - peak interpretation holds even for very large biases , @xmath128 to @xmath129 , and also in the mixed - valence regime",
    "[ fig6 ] also shows that the magnitude of the response current gradually decreases , and the transient oscillations damp out more quickly , as the dot energy level is moved downwards in energy .",
    "insight into this behavior may again be attained from study of a quantum dot in equilibrium . in the limit",
    "@xmath130 the kondo scale vanishes and the spectral weight at the fermi energy is suppressed .",
    "the dot enters the coulomb blockade regime , inhibiting the flow of current .",
    "finally we discuss the effect of non - zero temperature on the response currents .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows , for both noninteracting spinless and interacting spinning electrons , the currents at three temperatures : @xmath131 mk , @xmath132 mk and @xmath133 mk .",
    "the latter temperature is sufficiently high that multiple particle - hole pairs will be excited , as the level spacing is only @xmath134 mk at the fermi energy ; therefore the hilbert space restriction to at most two particle - hole pairs is a severe limitation .",
    "nevertheless , there is little change in the response of the spinless electrons as the temperature is increased .",
    "this is as it should be since the temperatures are still well below the fermi temperature of the leads .",
    "by contrast the @xmath7 case shows a significant decrease in the current magnitude , and especially the oscillations , at the higher temperatures . using the finite-@xmath10 formula eq .",
    "[ hal ] with @xmath135 , yields @xmath136 mk .",
    "considering the uncertainities involved in estimating the kondo temperature ( eq . [ hal ] gives the order of magnitude but the exact multiplicative factor is unknown ) we can expect a suppression of the kondo resonance and its associated effects at @xmath133 mk .",
    "the behavior of the currents shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] is consistent with this interpretation , as the period of the transient oscillations decreases to approach that of the spinless system .",
    "we have presented a method for calculating the response of a quantum dot to time - dependent bias potentials .",
    "the approach , which is based upon a truncation of the hilbert space , is systematic because corrections can be incorporated by including higher powers in the @xmath0 expansion . in agreement with previous approaches",
    "we find coherent oscillations in the response currents at low temperatures .",
    "we note that although the frequency of these oscillations is of order a terahertz for parameters typical of quantum dot devices , it should be possible to detect the oscillations experimentally@xcite .",
    "the dynamical @xmath0 approach permits a realistic description of the quantum dot as finite coulomb repulsion and multiple dot levels may be modeled . for typical device parameters ,",
    "response currents are qualitatively similar to those found in the @xmath3 limit . however , the magnitude of the current is larger .",
    "we also discussed an extension of the dynamical @xmath0 expansion to treat the case of non - zero temperature . in the case of interacting spinning electrons",
    "the magnitude of the currents , and the nature of the transient response are sensitive to relative size of the system temperature in comparison to the kondo temperature .",
    "in contrast non - interacting spinless electrons show little temperature dependence .",
    "the dynamical @xmath0 approach complements other methods such as nca and the tdmrg algorithm .",
    "the primary limitation of the dynamical @xmath0 approach comes from the truncation of the hilbert space in which only a small number of particle - hole pairs ( in this paper , at most two ) are permitted .",
    "hence , as it stands the method is not well suited for the study of steady state situations , and we can not use it , for instance , to answer the question of whether or not a lead - dot - lead system exhibits coherent oscillations at long times@xcite . as nca sums up an infinite set of feynman diagrams , including ones with arbitrary numbers of particle - hole pairs , it provides a far better description of long - time behavior , including steady state current flow . for the same reason nca is also superior at high temperature .",
    "however finite coulomb interactions and other realistic features of lead - dot - lead systems are technically difficult to incorporate within nca , but not in the dynamical @xmath0 method . also , nca shows unphysical behavior in the mixed valence regime , at very low temperatures , and in the spinless @xmath8 limit .",
    "the dynamical @xmath0 approach does not suffer from these pathologies .",
    "the method shares some features with the tdmrg algorithm as both are real - time approaches that truncate the hilbert space in a systematic , though in a different , fashion . unlike the present approach",
    ", tdmrg can treat strong electron interactions between electrons in the leads and can be used to study tunneling between luttinger liquids@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "non - interacting electrons in the leads are treated exactly within the dynamical @xmath0 approach . in tdmrg",
    "these require as much or more computational effort as interacting electrons .",
    "a complete description of the electronic transport properties in a set would require taking into account the whole energy spectrum of the quantum dot and would include both the direct coulomb repulsion and spin - exchange between electrons in different energy levels of the dot .",
    "also the conducting leads should be described by realistic densities of states .",
    "the dynamical @xmath0 approach is well suited to accommodate these complications .",
    "another aspect worth further attention is the case of orbital degeneracy of the dot levels . as the degeneracy increases , the kondo resonance strengthens , and its width decreases@xcite .",
    "a combined experimental and theoretical exploration of the effect of orbital degeneracy on transport properties would be interesting .",
    "finally , it should also be possible to extend the method to describe two coupled quantum dots attached to leads@xcite .",
    "competition between kondo resonances and spin - exchange between the two dots leads to unusual features such as a non - fermi liquid fixed point@xcite . probing nonlinear transport",
