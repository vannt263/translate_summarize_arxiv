    "recently released 7-year wmap data @xcite,@xcite has found no trace of deviation from the standard @xmath1cdm model .",
    "but the problem in connection with the cosmological constant remains unresolved .",
    "the vacuum energy density , as calculated by the field theorists , is some @xmath2 order of magnitude greater than the cosmological constant @xmath1 required by the cosmologists , to explain late time cosmic acceleration , which is of the order of @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the present hubble parameter .",
    "so far , many alternatives to the standard @xmath1cdm model have been proposed and explored and as a matter of fact , all of these models have been found suitable to explain late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "the problems associated with these models are , - they can not be distinguished from the standard @xmath1cdm model at one hand , and most of them are not suitable to explain the early universe , on the other .",
    "however , @xmath1cdm model requires @xmath0 of matter in the form of pressureless dust , out of which only @xmath5 are baryons and the rest , about @xmath6 are cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "since dark matter interacts only with the gravitational field , so it plays a key role in the structure formation .",
    "the gravitational jeans instability allows compact structures to form and is not opposed by any force like radiation pressure in the case of dark matter . as a result ,",
    "dark matter begins to collapse into a complex network of dark matter halos , well before ordinary baryonic matter , which is impeded by pressure force . without dark matter",
    "the epoch of galaxy formation would have occurred at a substantially later stage , than observed .",
    "thus , the amount of cdm ( @xmath6 ) must have been created in the very early universe , prior to the radiation dominated era together with the baryons , by some sort of mechanism , viz .",
    ", supersymmetry breaking , cosmic string decay or particle creation at the expense of gravitational field .",
    "these particles are usually supposed to be weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) .",
    "for example , as a heavy stable particle , the lightest neutralino is an excellent candidate to comprise the universe s cold dark matter . in many models ( see @xcite for a nice review ) the lightest neutralino can be produced in the hot early universe and leave approximately the right relic abundance to account for the observed dark matter , ie .",
    ", @xmath6 as required by @xmath1cdm model .",
    "now , if phenomenologically one considers that cdm may also be produced by gravitational particle creation mechanism , even at a very slow rate , during the late time evolution of the universe , viz .",
    ", during the matter dominated era , as considered by lima et - al @xcite , then it may be possible to explain the presently observable acceleration of the universe , without taking dark energy into account .",
    "the very advantage of the creation of cold dark matter over dark energy is that it avoids coincidence problem and also may be detectable in future experiments . in the present work our focus is on the cosmological consequences of particle production on the evolution of late stage of the universe which was initiated recently by alcaniz and lima @xcite and lima , silva and santos(lss ) @xcite .",
    "+ we remember that in the eighty s , the motivation that initiated to go after inflationary scenario , was the fundamental three problems associated with friedmann model , viz . , the horizon , the flatness and the observed isotropy and homogeneity in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "there was an additional problem in the form of huge entropy per baryon in the observable universe @xmath7 .",
    "einstein s equations are purely adiabatic and reversible .",
    "consequently , these equations can hardly provide , by themselves , an explanation relating to the origin of cosmological entropy .",
    "this problem was resolved @xcite by taking into account the cosmological consequence of irreversible particle creation phenomena in the framework of einstein s equation , classically .",
    "+ particle creation phenomena was explored largely during the last century to explain the early universe .",
    "matter constituents may be produced quantum mechanically @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in the framework of einstein s equations .",
    "cosmological consequence of particle creation mechanism is studied taking into account an explicit phenomenological balance law ( see appendix ) for the particle number @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in addition to the familiar einstein s equations . in view of such a balance law ,",
    "prigogine et - al @xcite successfully explained the cosmological evolution of the early universe .",
    "+ recently , lima et - al @xcite have developed a late time model universe , taking into account the creation phenomena in the matter dominated era .",
    "the model admits early deceleration followed by a recent acceleration of the universe as suggested by present observations and fits snia data to some extent .",
    "however , they @xcite have shown that in their model the creation phenomena is never ending , as a result cosmic evolution does not ever include standard radiation dominated or matter dominated friedmann era .",
    "this definitely creates problem in explaining the structure formation of the universe and the cmbr .",
    "later , steigman et - al @xcite analyzed the model in the two limits of high and low redshifts .",
    "they have observed a clear conflict between the wmap constraint on matter - radiation equality @xmath8 at high redshift and snia data at low redshift .",
    "the main criticisms of the @xmath9 model proposed by lima et - al @xcite are that they have not taken into account the amount of cdm created in the very early universe at one end , and that their creation rate @xmath10 depends on the present hubble parameter , on the other .",
    "if these problems are alleviated , then phenomenologically particle creation process obviously unifies early inflation with late stage of cosmic acceleration in an elegant fashion . + in the present work",
    ", we propose a model where , instead of choosing the creation parameter @xmath11 arbitrarily , we have considered the experimentally verified fact that the universe has recently entered an accelerated phase of expansion . as a result",
    "we have chosen the scale factor judiciously , such that particle creation could start again in the matter dominated era .",
    "this naturally alleviates the said problems and unifies the early and the late stages of cosmic evolution , in an elegant fashion .",
    "additionally , the model fits perfectly with the wmap constraint on matter - radiation equality @xmath8 only if one considers the presence of nearly @xmath0 of primeval matter in the form of baryons and cdm . in view of such a model",
    ", particle creation phenomena is now able to explain the history of cosmic evolution from the very early universe till date , without requiring dark energy at any stage and thus avoiding coincidence problem .",
    "+ in the following section we write down the field equations incorporating the phenomena of particle creation , which is apparent through the balance equation . in section 3 ,",
    "we show how the conflict between high redshift and the low redshift data may be reduced in the model presented by lima et al @xcite , just by accounting for some amount of cdm produced in the very early universe .",
    "however , we also mention some more problems which are still associated with their @xcite model . in section 4 , instead of choosing a form of the creation rate arbitrarily",
    ", we rather choose a form of the scale factor , suitable for a transition from the early deceleration to the late time cosmic acceleration , to understand the associated problems .",
    "this gives us insight to find a form of the creation rate @xmath11 associated with the so called intermediate inflation @xcite .",
    "such a form of @xmath11 appears to be much elegant to study the cosmological evolution alleviating all the problems discussed .",
    "this has been done in section 5 .",
    "finally we end up with the conclusion in section 6 and an appendix in section ( 7 ) , to calculate the balance law .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , cosmological consequence taking into account particle creation phenomena is studied by using an explicit phenomenological balance law for the particle number @xcite,@xcite .",
    "such a balance law in the process of particle production is modeled by @xmath12 with a source term @xmath13 . for a vanishing @xmath13",
    "the particle number is conserved . in the isotropic and homogeneous background metric",
    ",    ds^2=-dt^2+a(t)^2    above balance law reduces to , @xmath14 where , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the fluid four velocity vector , the total number of particles , particle number density and the hubble parameter respectively , while , @xmath19 is the expansion scalar . thus , the field equations in the spatially flat ( @xmath20 ) robertson walker metric ( 1 ) associated with particle creation phenomena are ,    2h + 3h^2 = - 8g(p_m+p_cm ) ,    3h^2 = 8 g ( _ m + _ cm ) = 8 g ,    3h + = = ,    p_cm = -.for the last equation ( 5 ) please see the appendix . in the above set of equations , @xmath21 is the hubble parameter , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the pressure and the energy density of the matter existing in the universe in the form of a barotropic fluid containing baryons and cold dark matter , created in the very early universe . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the pressure and the energy density of the cold dark matter in the form of wimp created at the late stage of cosmic evolution , ie . , during matter",
    "dominated era .",
    "@xmath11 is the creation parameter , and @xmath17 is the particle number density . it has been shown in the appendix that the second law of thermodynamics allows the creation of particle from the gravitational field and the process is irreversible .",
    "thus the creation parameter @xmath26 , and so it is clear from equation ( 5 ) that the particle creation phenomena is always associated with a negative pressure @xmath24 , which may be responsible for acceleration at the late stage of cosmic evolution .",
    "we would like to mention at this stage that , other than cold dark matter and baryons , different types of particles may be created in view of quantum field theory in curved space time @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and all are associated with a negative pressure , as mentioned .",
    "however , also , as mentioned in the introduction that the structure formation requires @xmath6 that are constituted by dark matter , which must have been created in the early universe .",
    "the present estimated amount of baryons is @xmath5 and the rest amount required for present cosmic acceleration is usually treated as dark energy .",
    "other form of matter ( like hot dark matter , say ) has negligible contribution . here",
    ", we proceed to show that creation of the same amount of cdm also solves the puzzle .",
    "further , note that the creation of baryons and cdm in the early universe was also associated with a large negative pressure .",
    "however , the creation phenomena weakened and finally stopped , when universe expanded sufficiently , thereby giving way to the hot big bang followed by the radiation dominated era of friedmann type ( @xmath27 ) @xcite . there after , the baryons and the cdm created in the very early universe obviously start acting as pressureless dust , so that we can take @xmath28 and hence @xmath29 , @xmath30 being a constant .",
    "thus we can simplify the above equations to get ,    = 3 h + 2 = 3h ( ) = -3hw_e ,    _ cm = - _ 0 a^-3 ,    p_cm = - h ,    @xmath31 being the effective state parameter . in view of the above set of three equations ( 6 ) - ( 8) , we need to find the scale factor @xmath32 ( and consequently @xmath33 , the hubble parameter ) , the creation rate @xmath11 , the creation pressure @xmath24 and the creation matter density @xmath25 . obviously , we need yet another suitable condition to solve the system of equations .",
    "lima et al @xcite studied these equations under the assumption of a form of the creation rate @xmath11 .",
    "afterwards , while further studying their model in connection with data fitting , they found a clear conflict between the low ( snia ) and high ( wmap constraint on @xmath8 ) @xcite redshift limits . in the following section",
    ", we review the problem and show how the production of cdm in the very early universe alleviates the problem .",
    "the friedmann equation , taking into account the created matter , baryonic matter and radiation reads ,    ( ) ^2 = _ r ( 1+z)^4 + _ b ( 1+z)^3 + ,    where , @xmath34 is the present value of critical density . to calculate the last term",
    "let us take the total number of created particles at an instant to be @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the comoving volume at that instant .",
    "thus the creation rate is given as ,    = = ,    which yields ,    _ cm = _",
    "cm0(1+z)^3 ,    where , @xmath37 is the present value of the created matter density .",
    "thus ,    = _ cm(1+z)^3 ,    where , @xmath38 is the density parameter corresponding to the created matter .",
    "so , the friedmann equation ( 9 ) finally reads ,    ( ) ^2 = _ r ( 1+z)^4 + _ b ( 1+z)^3 + _ cm(1+z)^3 .",
    "now , under the assumption @xmath39 , where , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constants and @xmath4 is the present hubble parameter , ( lss ) @xcite obtained a solution of the scale factor in the form ,    @xmath42^{\\frac{2}{3(1-\\beta)}},\\ ] ]    which admits the observed transition from early deceleration to late time acceleration . in a later investigation @xcite ,",
    "this model was found to produce a conflict between snia data at low redshift and wmap - 5 year data constraint @xcite on mater - radiation equality @xmath43 , occurred at the high redshift limit of observed isw effect .",
    "let us review the situation to find the real problem associated with the conflict .",
    "the friedmann equation ( 13 ) in the model under consideration reads ,    ( ) ^2 = _ r ( 1+z)^4 + _ b ( 1+z)^3 + _",
    "cm(1+z)^3(1- ) ,    where , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the age at any instant and the present age of the universe respectively , in the units of hubble s age @xmath46 . setting , @xmath47 , the @xmath48 relation is obtained ( see equation ( 34 ) in @xcite ) as ,    = ( 1- ) .",
    "this model fits snia data for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , while @xmath51 , taking @xmath52 .",
    "clearly , the model does not fit with the wmap - 5 year data constraint @xcite on mater - radiation equality @xmath43 , occurred at the high redshift limit of observed isw effect .",
    "this contradiction may be alleviated easily , if we consider existence of cold dark matter that was created in the early universe and which was responsible for inflation .",
    "as , already mentioned , this amount of cdm created in the very early universe behaves now as pressureless dust and has been redshifted like baryons .",
    "if we now add corresponding density parameter @xmath53 , associated with the cold dark matter created in the very early universe in equation ( 13 ) , it reads    ( ) ^2 = _ r ( 1+z)^4 + _ m ( 1+z)^3 + _ cm(1+z)^3 ,    where , @xmath54 and , @xmath55 . in the absence of matter creation phenomena in the late universe , @xmath56 vanish , and hence @xmath57 .",
    "thus there is no creation pressure @xmath22 as well as creation matter density @xmath25 .",
    "hence , @xmath58 .",
    "thus at the matter - radiation equality @xmath59 taking , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , one recovers @xmath62 , which is at par with wmap data .",
    "equation ( 15 ) now takes the form ,    = ( 1- ) .    if we now consider that @xmath63 of cdm ( say ) were produced in the very early universe , then @xmath64 and thus for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath65 , which is very much at par with wmap data @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this clearly indicates that one should include the contribution of cdm created at the very early universe .",
    "the creation of cdm in the very early universe , as mentioned in the introduction , was halted and the universe entered usual friedmann radiation dominated era .",
    "thereafter , this amount of cdm is being redshifted like baryons . + in the above analysis , while we have showed how the conflict encountered between low and high redshift data @xcite may be reduced , nevertheless , it does not support the model @xcite .",
    "firstly , in their @xmath66 model , @xmath49 , somehow fits snia data , which is not a very good fit at all ( see fig . 1 @xcite ) .",
    "further , @xmath49 turns out to give a constant creation rate throughout the evolution of the universe , which is highly objectionable .",
    "also , the choice of the creation parameter ( @xmath11 ) as a function of present hubble parameter ( @xmath4 ) implies that the model is plagued by the coincidence problem .",
    "finally , we could accommodate only @xmath63 of cdm out of @xmath6 to alleviate the conflict @xcite .",
    "addition of another @xmath67 of cdm shifts @xmath8 to a much higher value . in view of the above criticism",
    "we pose to present a more realistic model .",
    "to get an explicit solution of the field equations ( 6 ) through ( 8) , we need yet another physically reasonable assumption .",
    "however , we really have no idea of the rate of matter creation @xmath11 either from quantum field theoretic ( qft in cst ) or from classical kinetic approach .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from equation ( 5 ) that such phenomena is associated with a negative pressure @xmath68 .",
    "if the creation pressure is sufficiently negative , it might lead to an accelerating phase of cosmological evolution .",
    "additionally , in order to get an idea about the form of the creation rate we can also depend on the presently available cosmological data and the best fit models . since @xmath1cdm model has excellent fit with the snia and wmap data , so we can infer certain important aspects of cosmological evolution .",
    "first of these is definitely that the universe has encountered a transition from early deceleration to late time acceleration .",
    "next is , early growth of perturbation should track @xmath1cdm model closely .",
    "these facts allow us to choose a suitable form of the scale factor at par with the present experimental results and in the process , we expect to get an idea on the form of @xmath11 . in view of the two aspects of the late time",
    "cosmological evolution just discussed , we choose the scale factor in the matter dominated era as ,    a = a_0 t^+b_0t^ = b_0(q t^+t^ ) ,    where , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants with , @xmath72 .",
    "with such a form of the scale factor , the first term of equation ( 18 ) plays the leading role in the early stage of cosmological evolution in the matter dominated era and the universe tracks friedmann model @xmath73 , closely .",
    "thus , the growth of perturbation in connection with the structure formation tracks @xmath1cdm model closely .",
    "the second term appears in connection with the creation of matter , which is associated with a negative creation pressure .",
    "as @xmath74 increases , second term starts playing significant role and it starts dominating as @xmath75 , which implies that the creation phenomena starts rather late .",

    "thus , equation ( 18 ) clearly depicts early deceleration and late time acceleration of the universe .",

    "this problem has been resolved in the present model , which constraints primeval matter to @xmath142 . since , particle production starts long after matter - radiation equality , so the early growth of perturbation in connection with the structure formation also remains unaltered following the @xmath1cdm concordance model closely .",
    "thus particle production process may successfully explain the late stage of cosmic evolution also . as a result",
    ", the cosmological evolution of the universe may be explained successfully in view of particle creation phenomena from early time till date .",
    "+ presently we are having numerous dark energy models , explaining the late time cosmic phenomena .",
    "most of these models do not explain the early universe at one hand and it is not possible to identify these models from one another in any of the future experiments , on the other .",
    "cosmological consequence of particle creation phenomena does not require dark energy at all at any stage , and some programmes have been taken in the recent years to detect lightest neutralino of roughly @xmath143 gev - one of the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) . thus ,",
    "if creation phenomena of cold - dark - matter can solve the presently observed cosmic puzzle single handedly , without taking into account the dark energy at all , may be resolved in near future .",
    "in this appendix we formulate the balance equation in connection with particle creation phenomena .",
    "this has been done in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the approaches are slightly different , hence we produce a straight forward calculation .",
    "adiabatic cosmological evolution in the presence of particle creation can be treated in the open system , and so the first law of thermodynamics is modified as ,      where , @xmath144 , @xmath22 , @xmath145 , @xmath17 and @xmath146 are the total energy density , the true thermodynamical pressure , any arbitrary co - moving volume , the number of particles per unit volume and the enthalpy per unit volume respectively . in the case under consideration , the system receives heat only due to the transfer of energy from gravitation to matter .",
    "so , creation of particles acts as a source of internal energy .",
    "thus for adiabatic transformation the second law of thermodynamics reads ,          where , we have used the usual expression for the chemical potential as @xmath147 and define @xmath148 to be the entropy per unit volume and @xmath149 as the specific entropy .",
    "thus we observe that the second law of thermodynamics viz .",
    ", @xmath150 implies @xmath151 , and the reverse process is thermodynamically impossible , ie .",
    ", particle can only be created and can not be destroyed .",
    "further , expressing @xmath152 in terms of @xmath153 , the above equation can also be expressed as ,              where , @xmath155 is the total energy density and @xmath22 is the thermodynamic pressure , as already stated , while , @xmath24 is the creation pressure and @xmath156 is the component of four velocity vector .",
    "the energy conservation law ( 40 ) in homogeneous cosmological models reads ,          where , @xmath158 is the creation rate . + * acknowledgement : * the authors would like to thank the referees and the board member in particular , for pointing out several aspects which improved the quality of the manuscript considerably .",
