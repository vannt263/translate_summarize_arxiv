    "basic ideas on instabilities and dissipative pattern formation in open spatially extended nonlinear systems @xcite have gained substantial interest in many fields of science in the last two decades .",
    "( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the investigations become rather intensive also in the field of solid - state physics and electronics @xcite where a large variety of different nonlinear nonequilibrium phenomena occurs , which can cause spontaneously arising spatio - temporal patterns in materials and devices .",
    "together with highly developed device technology , these circumstances suggest promising opportunities for future research and developements .",
    "recently , attention has been called to thyristor - like semiconductor structures with large active areas @xcite , as these nonlinear systems with bistable properties show several spatial and spatio - temporal current - density patterns .",
    "such semiconductor structures could potentially be used as multi - stable elements for integrated circuits , self - organizing devices for image recognition and image processing , etc .",
    "one of the most striking results of former considerations based on phenomenological models @xcite is that the instability mechanisms posess some features very similar to those studied in biology or chemical media , which may show an extremly manifold selforganizing behavior .",
    "however , at present the understanding of instability mechanisms and pattern formation in multilayer structures is far from being complete .",
    "apparently , there is a lack of systematic investigations concerning self - organization aspects for this family of devices . in a very early theoretical paper",
    "@xcite the process of single current filament formation has only been analyzed for the simplest case of @xmath5-@xmath2-@xmath5-@xmath2 structures , that according to ridley s terminology @xcite belong to the class of extended electrical systems with current controlled negative differential resistance .",
    "recently , gate - driven @xmath5-@xmath2-@xmath5-@xmath2 structures have been used to study current filamentation and the dynamics of switching fronts under the constraints of two global couplings @xcite . in specially designed multilayer structures different types of filament oscillation have been observed @xcite .",
    "very few theoretical papers have been devoted to instabilities in standard thyristors ; they all aimed merely on a safe operation in power applications @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is not an easy task to adapt the advanced experience of power device technology directly to the specifics of devices showing phenomena of self - organization .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is that the operation of semiconductor devices and especially thyristors depends very sensitively on many physical and design parameters . on the one hand",
    ", this gives numerous opportunities for a proper choice of those parameters responsible for the intended function of these devices .",
    "but on the other hand the high - dimensional parameter space makes a systematic analysis rather difficult , because the use of numerical methods and the performance of experiments are usually time - consuming and/or expensive .",
    "therefore detailed studies of the underlying physical processes in conjunction with the material and the design parameters are necessary and should lead to the deepest possible analytical description of the device physics .    following this motivation and aiming at further development of concepts introduced earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite we suggest in this paper an analytical approach for instability mechanisms in a family of devices based on thyristor - like @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath3 structures , in which several modes of pattern formation have already been found experimentally @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 the investigated semiconductor structure and its basic physics with emphasis on the nonlinear properties are described .",
    "a non - stationary 1@xmath42-dimensional model rendering possible an analytical investigation of two - dimensional current - density and potential distributions transversal to the main current flow direction is derived in section 3 for two cases characterized by different nonlinear electrical mechanisms . in section 4 ,",
    "stationary homogeneous states are determined from the model equations and used to derive the current - voltage characteristics for systems with uniform current - density distributions .",
    "finally , the stability of stationary homogeneous states is studied in section 5 , including a discussion of important parameter dependencies .",
    "the system under consideration consists of a semiconductor structure with a vertical width @xmath6 of several hundreds of @xmath7 m and with the two other ( transversal ) widths @xmath8 . along the vertical direction",
    "the structure is characterized by a @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath3 doping profile as schematically shown in fig .",
    "the outer @xmath0 and @xmath3 layer of the structure are provided with metal contacts .",
    "the internal design of the structure possesses the following peculiarities :    \\(i ) along the ( vertical ) @xmath9-direction the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath3 structure can be divided into an active ( triggering ) subsystem consisting of a four - layer thyristor - like @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath3 structure and a subsystem of a distributed resistive layer consisting essentially of the remainder @xmath1 layer .",
    "note that the thyristor - like regeneration mechanism in the active subsystem causes an autocatalytic increase of the current density in a certain current interval which is counteracted by the resistive layer .",
    "the width of the @xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath3 part is only a few tens of @xmath7 m which is more than an order less than the whole width @xmath6 of the device .",
    "the lifetime @xmath10 of the excess carriers in the bulk material is supposed to be so small that conductivity modulation of the bulk due to the injection of electrons and holes from the outer @xmath3 and @xmath0 layers is prevented .",
    "this can be achieved by reducing the lifetime in the main part of the bulk in a certain distance to the anode contact leaving a relatively thin part of the @xmath1 layer with large @xmath10 nearby the inner @xmath2 layer .",
    "\\(ii ) the doping concentrations @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the layers forming the cathode emitter @xmath0-@xmath3 junction [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] are similar to those used in high frequency bipolar transistors .",
    "the electron injection efficiency of this junction increases from nearly zero at very low current densities to a saturation value of approximately 0.8 - 0.9 at rather small current densities of the order of 1 ma/@xmath13 .",
    "\\(iii ) the doping concentration @xmath14 of the @xmath1 layer is much smaller than the doping concentration @xmath15 of the @xmath2 base .",
    "hence , for low currents , current transport through this junction is dominated by a leakage current of electrons from the @xmath2 base into the @xmath1 emitter and , consequently , the injection efficiency of the @xmath1-@xmath2 junction is very small .",
    "\\(iv ) the widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 base , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in the thyristor - like subsystem are much smaller than the diffusion lengths @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the minority carriers in these layers : @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , both base transport factors are about one .",
    "when a dc voltage is applied to the device such that the outer @xmath3 layer is biased negatively with respect to the outer @xmath0 layer , the anode and cathode emitter junction are forward biased , while the collector junction is reverse - biased .",
    "thus , double injection occurs inside the thyristor - like subsystem accompanied by a characteristic nonequilibrium plasma - field stratification along the vertical direction @xmath9 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . due to the chosen doping proportion at the @xmath1-@xmath2 junction , which is just inverse to that in standard thyristors",
    ", there is a significant electron leakage current from the @xmath2 base into the @xmath1 layer which obviously exceeds the electron injection current .",
    "therefore , a rather large excess charge accumulates in a thin plasma layer ( @xmath22 layer ) . if the carrier lifetime in this plasma layer is sufficiently large , the local dynamics of this charge at non - stationary conditions may be considered to be the most inertial process , thus determining the temporal evolution of the whole device .",
    "the derivation of the model equations in section 3 is based essentially on these physical properties .",
    "the nonlinear feedback mechanism between the electron and hole injection currents in the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath3 subsystem is similar to that in standard thyristors .",
    "however , there are remarkable peculiarities and it is useful to distinguish between two cases , corresponding to certain current intervals , which are characterized by a particular nonlinear mechanism , respectively , causing the appearance of negative differential resistance in the current - voltage characteristic of the thyristor - like subsystem . in analogy to the two - transistor approach for thyristors",
    "we consider the thyristor - like subsystem to be composed of an @xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath3 and a @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath0 transistor to specify the two different regenerative mechanisms .",
    "current regeneration @xcite in thyristors is possible for current intervals , in which the condition @xmath23 holds , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the thyristor voltage and current , and @xmath26 is the differential resistance .",
    "@xmath27 is implicitly given by the steady state condition @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the current gains of the @xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath3 and the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath0 transistor , respectively [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] .",
    "charge carrier recombination in the space charge region of the emitter junction of a transistor influences the current gain significantly @xcite and typically leads to a monotonic increase of the current gain with increasing current for not too large currents .",
    "consider the device parameters to be of such kind that the current gain @xmath29 approaches a value close to one at relatively low currents ( @xmath31a/@xmath13 ) . then eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_sum ] ) can be fulfilled at a very low injection efficiency of the @xmath1-@xmath2 emitter junction .",
    "thus , this case  subsequently called _ low current range _  is roughly characterized by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    if the doping profile and other parameters are chosen such that @xmath29 saturates in the low current range before eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_sum ] ) is true , regeneration does not occur at low currents .",
    "nevertheless , at larger currents regeneration might become possible again when @xmath30 increases monotonously with the current .",
    "this can occur at sufficiently large current , when a plasma layer @xmath22 evolves in the @xmath1 layer near the @xmath1-@xmath2 junction and the injection of excess holes from this plasma layer into the @xmath2 base increases superlinearly as proposed by fletcher @xcite .",
    "consequently , the @xmath22 layer plays the role of a plasma emitter , the efficiency of which rises strongly with the current so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_sum ] ) can be fulfilled .",
    "this case is called _ moderate current range _ subsequently and is roughly characterized by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "before we start with a detailed analysis of these two cases let us turn to a short discussion on important transversal processes which have to be taken into account for an analytic description , too . to this end , consider a so - called differential element of the whole @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath3 structure , which is small in @xmath36 and @xmath37 direction . fig .  [",
    "fig2](b ) shows schematically contours of possible current fluctuations in such an element which may lead to a destabilization of the homogeneous current flow . obviously , there are three channels along which transversal currents effect a transversal spatial coupling in the thyristor - like subsystem : the @xmath0 base , the @xmath2 base , and the possibly conductivity modulated @xmath22 layer in the @xmath1 bulk , in which the corresponding transversal fluctuations @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 may arise . for the resistor subsystem transversal current fluctuations",
    "@xmath41 are taken into account ; they are distributed over the whole bulk due to three - dimensional deformations of the potential distribution @xmath42 ; these deformations are caused by potential fluctuations at the interface between the two subsystems , which in turn result from local current fluctuations in the thyristor - like subsystem .",
    "the metallic layers forming the anode and cathode contact on the top and bottom of the device represent further channels denoted by @xmath43 and @xmath44 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and render possible the formation of closed loops of current fluctuations inside the system without any interaction with elements of the external circuit .",
    "thus , all differential elements of the system are connected to each other by both the vertical feedback mechanism and transversal couplings which have to be considered in a self - consistent description as outlined in detail in the following sections .",
    "as mentioned above the excess plasma of the @xmath45 layer is considered to be the most inertial part of the system .",
    "consequently , all other nonstationary transport effects are neglected .",
    "we start with a derivation of the basic equations for the low current range . based on these results",
    "the peculiarities concerning the case of moderate currents are discussed in a second subsection .      in the low current case",

    "curve ( 2a ) represents the case that the increment @xmath208 of this critical wave - number is zero , while all other increments are still smaller than zero , i.e. , the uniform state becomes destabilized with respect to current - density fluctuations with the critical wave - number . when the sample current is decreased , the curve is shifted up [ curve ( 2b ) ] , and the increments of a certain band of wave - numbers are larger than zero . this behavior can be interpreted as a turing - like instability @xcite .",
    "when the transversal coupling inside the thyristor - like subsystem is strengthened , e.g. by reducing the transversal resistance of the @xmath0 base , the maxima of @xmath229 shift to smaller @xmath175 values leading to dispersion relations like those denoted by ( 1 ) .",
    "they are characterized by a monotonous decrease of @xmath229 with growing @xmath175 , which can be considered as an instability of ridley s type @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the uniform state is typically destabilized via a saddle node bifurcation by fluctuations with the shortest possible wave - number @xmath231 , if uniform fluctuations are suppressed by a sufficiently large load resistor in the external circuit .",

    "similar to the low current case the homogeneous state is destabilized at a critical current level either by an instability of ridley s ( curves 1 ) or turing s type ( curves 2 ) .",
    "the bifurcation type can be controlled by a proper design .",
    "the most important parameters are the conductivities of the resistive layer , the @xmath0 and the @xmath2 base .",
    "the former essentially governs the transversal spreading of the potential drop across the resistive layer and tends to damp out current - density fluctuations . the @xmath0 and @xmath2 base conductivity control the transversal hole and electron current densities in the two base layers .",
    "as these base currents in turn regulate the injection of electrons and holes from the @xmath233 emitter and the plasma layer @xmath22 , respectively , they play an important role concerning the transversal spreading of a region with enhanced current density . the competition between the damping and the activating process , is the essential physical mechanism allowing - under properly chosen design parameters - the destabilization of a homogeneous current - density distribution by spatially periodic current - density fluctuations strongly reminding of the generic mechanism proposed by turing .",
    "in conclusion we point out that the suggested theory , which is based on a subdivision of the semiconductor structure into an active and a passive subsystem , supplies a self - consistent quantitative description of the nonlinear mechanisms , which control the longitudinal current flow , and the transversal current - density instabilities in multilayer semiconductor systems .",
    "the nonlinear longitudinal electrical properties in the active layer are based on a thyristor - like regenerative mechanism , while the passive subsystem acts as a simple resistive layer .",
    "depending on the system parameters two different types of regenerative mechanisms can be distinguished leading to specific model equations .",
    "a stability analysis of the derived equations reveals that in each case two basic bifurcation types can be expected when the total sample current is varied .",
    "the bifurcations are caused by instability mechanisms that are closely related to those studied by turing @xcite and ridley @xcite .",
    "it turned out that in particular the conductivity ratios of the @xmath0 base , the plasma layer , and the resistive layer are important parameters to control the instability mechanism .",
    "thus , adjusting the respective transversal conductivities , e.g. , by irradiating the sample with protons or ions , using compensated substrate material , or adapting the sample geometry , it is possible to design a multilayer system with the aspired ( in)stability features .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the suggested approach presents a basis for further numerical analysis of pattern formation processes .",
