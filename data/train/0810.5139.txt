    "stellar magnetic activity is closely related to rotation in solar - type stars . in slow rotators , activity scales with the rotation rate until it becomes saturated at a certain velocity , which means that it does not grow further regardless of rotation rate @xcite .",
    "this effect is seen in a broad variety of activity indicators @xcite . the threshold rate at which saturation occurs depends on the spectral type of the star , with the convective overturning time perhaps determining this threshold .",
    "saturation sets in where the value of the rossby number @xmath0 , i.e. where the timescale of rotation is significantly shorter than the timescale of typical convective eddies .    indicators of stellar activity are usually coronal or chromospheric emission observed at x - ray , uv , optical , infrared , or radio wavelengths .",
    "we know from the sun that this emission is induced by magnetic fields heating the upper layers of the solar atmosphere , and by analogy we conclude that stellar activity is connected to magnetic fields on the surface of other stars . at high rotation rates ( or small rossby numbers ) , all activity indicators saturate , i.e. they do not grow over a certain level regardless of higher rotation rates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "two possible explanations exist for the saturation : 1 ) the stellar dynamo process saturates and stars can not produce magnetic fields stronger than the saturation value ; or 2 ) the magnetic fields continue to grow at more rapid rotation , but the fraction of the surface filled with fields  or the area covered by spots  reaches unity so that no more emitting plasma can be placed on the star .",
    "the only way to decide which way the stars go is to directly measure the magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , this is very difficult and the picture  particularly in stars with saturated activity  is not yet clear .",
    "@xcite has collected measurements of magnetic flux @xmath1 , of the filling factor @xmath2 , and of rotation periods to investigate the behavior of magnetic fields on stars .",
    "it is important to realize that the magnetic flux , or the magnetic field average over the whole surface , is not the same as the local field .",
    "it is the ( unsigned ) mean average of the magnetic field strength over the whole surface .",
    "furthermore , the strongest magnetic fields in cool spots may not be fully captured because their contribution to the total flux is dimished due to their low temperature . as on the sun , magnetic flux",
    "is probably concentrated in relatively small regions of strong fields ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite shows that in stars rotating slower than the saturation threshold the magnetic flux @xmath1 as well as the filling factor @xmath2 show the same trend as all other activity indicators : they grow with larger rotation rate . at high rotation rates , @xcite claims",
    "that saturation occurs in the filling factor @xmath2 but not in the magnetic flux @xmath1 . from this result",
    "one would conclude that a star rotating at the saturation threshold is completely covered with magnetism ( @xmath3 ) , and that the saturation phenomenon is due to the saturation of the emission process while the star s magnetic flux can grow further with higher rotation .",
    "@xcite has reinvestigated this issue with a few more data points , noting that there is some indication for a saturation at @xmath4 kg at small rossby numbers .",
    "much higher magnetic flux could be in contradiction to the idea that magnetic fields in stellar atmospheres can not grow stronger than the equipartition field , i.e. the field strength at which the magnetic pressure equals the gas pressure .",
    "however , @xcite shows that the equipartition field may not necessarily be a hard upper limit for the field strength at @xmath3 , so that more rapidly rotating stars could in principle have much stronger fields .",
    "the only way to decide whether @xmath1 does saturate or not is to provide direct measurements of magnetic flux in the regime of saturated activity .",
    "generally , the measurement of magnetic fields relies on the splitting of spectral lines through the zeeman effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in rapid rotators , the subtle effect of magnetic broadening",
    "is buried under the rotational line broadening so that it is particularly difficult to directly measure the magnetic flux in the regime of saturated magnetic activity . however , the crucial datum for rotational line broadening is the projected rotation velocity @xmath5 and not the rossby number or the rotation period ( which are the numbers that appear to set the saturation threshold of magnetic activity ) .",
    "mainly because of the smaller radius of cooler stars , the surface rotation velocity at which saturation sets in depends on spectral type . in early g - type stars ,",
    "the saturation velocity in the transition region is on the order of 30kms@xmath6 ( and only 15kms@xmath6 in the corona , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in m dwarfs ,",
    "it is less than 5kms@xmath6 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in sun - like stars , the high surface rotation velocity required for activity saturation hampers the measurement of magnetic flux , but this regime can easily be probed in m stars .",
    "one potential problem with the use of m dwarfs for the investigation of dynamo related phenomena is that the interior structure changes around spectral type m3.5  stars cooler than that are completely convective .",
    "nevertheless , no change in activity is observed at the threshold to complete convection .",
    "a rotation - activity connection is observed in m stars down to spectral types m  8.5 @xcite .    in this paper , we present direct measurements of magnetic flux in several m stars .",
    "some of them are very rapid rotators and clearly belong to the regime of saturated activity .",
    "we aim to clarify whether the magnetic flux @xmath1 saturates as h@xmath7 and x - ray emission do , or if @xmath1 continues to grow beyond @xmath8 kg .",
    "for our sample we chose a number of mid - m stars with known x - ray emission and presumably high rotation rates .",
    "the values @xmath5 and @xmath9 are taken from @xcite except for gj3379 .",
    "this value is calculated from the x - ray luminosity taken from @xcite . with one exception , projected rotation velocities @xmath5",
    "were available for all targets .",
    "we chose only stars in which @xmath5 was reported to be above 5kms@xmath6 and which show saturated normalized x - ray emission .",
    "for gj3379 we are not aware of any former @xmath5 measurement , but the high value of normalized x - ray emission is indicative of saturation and we added the star to our sample .",

    "this method does not require theoretical models of the magnetic zeeman splitting of feh lines , which are not available yet .",
    "we determine the magnetic flux of our target stars by comparison of the spectral regions at 9895.59905.5 , 9937.59941.0 , 9946.09956.0 , and 9971.59981.0  ( for more details see rb07 ) . in figs.[fig : slow][fig : rapid2 ] we show the data and the quality of our fit in the top panels .",
    "note that in rapid rotators the difference between magnetic and non - magnetic stars is not necessarily clearest at the exact location of magnetically sensitive lines .",
    "the blending of lines through rotation pronounces differences at wavelengths where the equivalent widths of lines differ the most between active and inactive stars .",
    "for example , the two feh lines at 9949.1  and 9951.7  are magnetically not very sensitive ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it appears that the 9949.1  line effectively gains a little in equivalent width .",
    "thus , at rotation rates as high as shown in figs.[fig : rapid ] and [ fig : rapid2 ] , the region around 9949  becomes the one of largest difference .",
    "the reason for this are the magnetically sensitive features next to insensitive lines together with the effective gain in equivalent width , although such differences are not necessarily overt for the observer once doppler broadening is introduced . on the other hand , it can also happen that at wavelengths where the unrotated spectra are quite different , rotational broadening averages in adjacent flux in such a way that the magnetic differences end up erasing each other there ( e.g. at 9948 ) .",
    "thus , it is necessary to carry out a spectral fitting procedure after proper preparation instead of relying on appearances in original template spectra at fixed wavelenghts .",

    "uncertainties in @xmath5 and @xmath1 are typically around 1kms@xmath6 and a few hundred gauss , respectively .",

    "our active template star gl  873 , which we are using as comparison for our targets , has a mean magnetic field of about 4 kg .",
    "from comparison to the spectrum of gl873 we can not measure magnetic flux in excess of that value . in rb07",
    "we show a spectrum of yz  cmi ( m4.5 , @xmath44kms@xmath6 ) from which we inferred a mean field stronger than 4 kg .",

    "thus , although we lack a spectrum independently calibrated to stronger magnetic flux to compare with , we see no way that the spectra of the three most rapidly rotating stars can be consistent with magnetic flux stronger than @xmath45 kg . we discuss these stars further below .",

    "in particular , age is probably of little direct importance for the generation of very high magnetic flux : wx  uma is an old disk flare star while yz  cmi is a member of the young disk population @xcite .",
    "even if the two strongest magnetic flux measurements are due to exceptionally small rossby numbers , this would not explain the saturation of @xmath1 between @xmath94 and @xmath103 .",
    "across an order of magnitude in @xmath85 , @xmath1 varies by at most a factor of a few .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the nearly hundredfold increase in @xmath1 in going from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "we have concluded that both magnetic flux and chromospheric h@xmath7 ( as well as coronal x - ray ) emission saturate at small @xmath85 . with the large uncertainties in @xmath1",
    ", we can not reliably determine whether there is any super - saturation effect , with magnetic flux declining in the most rapid rotators .",
    "although both emission and magnetic flux appear to saturate at small @xmath85 , we observe a large scatter of magnetic flux among the stars with small @xmath85 , and likewise some scatter in h@xmath7 emission .",
    "we thus examined whether a relation between h@xmath7 emission and magnetic flux still exists at very small rossby numbers . in fig.[fig : bf_alpha ] , we plot normalized h@xmath7 emission vs. magnetic flux for our stars .",
    "as expected , @xmath35 grows as @xmath1 grows from zero to 2 kg . beyond that , i.e. in the regime of saturated magnetic flux , no further increase in chromospheric emission is observed , although @xmath1 grows as large as 4 kg .",
    "no obvious correlation exists between chromospheric emission and magnetic flux in the regime of saturation .",
    "this could mean that saturation of chromospheric emission occurs above a certain level of integrated flux on the star ( for example , because the filling factor reached unity ) .",
    "the field could then grow stronger without causing further heating .",
    "this is in fact not ruled out by our poorly constrained understanding of chromospheric heating mechanisms .    as of now",
    ", the available data do not permit us to distinguish reliably between these two possibilities .",
    "but , as noted above , the most rapid rotators in our sample probably do not possess magnetic fluxes higher than among other stars in the saturated regime : in fig.[fig : bf_alpha ] , stars with the smallest rossby numbers lie at the low-@xmath1 end of the plateau .",
    "neither are they the stars with the highest normalized chromspheric emission .",
    "thus the lack of tight correlation between emission and @xmath1 in the saturation regime should _ not _ be construed as evidence that magnetic flux continues to be correlated with rotation , but decouples from emission . instead , our data suggest that any variation of h@xmath7 emission or @xmath1 in the saturation regime must either be random ",
    "i.e. due to the observational scatter  or depend on parameters other than rotation . at this stage",
    ", we note only that the plateau in fig.[fig : bf_alpha ] is consistent with scatter alone .",
    "using absorption lines of molecular feh we have measured the magnetic flux in seven m stars that are known x - ray sources . with one exception",
    "they were known as rapid rotators as well .",
    "we reinvestigated the projected rotational velocities @xmath5 and measured chromospheric emission in h@xmath7 .",
    "all stars proved to be strong h@xmath7 emitters . in our analysis of @xmath5",
    ", we found some inconsistencies with former literature , which we ascribe to our more sophisticated ( direct ) fitting method and better data quality .",
    "all of our target stars show strong h@xmath7 emission at the saturation level ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "we detected magnetic fields of kg - strength in all our targets . while in less rapidly rotating stars ,",
    "h@xmath7 and magnetic flux correlate with rotation rate , no such correlation is observed in our sample .",
    "in contrast to sun - like stars of spectral types g and k , m dwarfs rotating at @xmath107kms@xmath6 have very small rossby numbers .",
    "thus , our sample targets add to the amount of stars with measured magnetic flux in the regime of small rossby number , i.e. in the regime of saturated magnetic activity .",
    "our primary goal was to determine whether magnetic flux in this regime continues to grow with more rapid rotation , as sometimes suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , or instead saturates in the same manner as coronal and chromospheric emission .",
    "our main conclusion is that around a rossby number of @xmath108 , magnetic flux saturates at approximately @xmath109 kg .",
    "below @xmath110 , @xmath1 does not grow stronger with decreasing rossby number . in looking at the effect of rossby number ( @xmath111 ) ,",
    "we are primarily sensitive to the effects of rotation , because the sampled rotations vary by a factor of more than ten , while the convective overturn time probably changes less than a factor of two in the range of m stars we are considering .    in the regime of saturated magnetic flux and chromospheric emission , we still observe a strong scatter in magnetic flux .",
    "the interpretation of this feature is not clear .",
    "it may be that below the critical rossby number , normalized h@xmath7 emission is not sensitive to changes in @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , in light of the large systematic errors of our @xmath1 measurements , the scatter of @xmath1 in the saturated regime may be fully explained by observational uncertainties .",
    "our results indicate that the strengths of stellar magnetic fields , and not merely their filling fractions on the surface alone , reach a maximum at a certain rotation rate .",
    "the scatter in magnetic flux among the stars with very small rossby numbers , however , is substantial .",
    "typical values are between 2 and 4 kg .",
    "two stars show magnetic flux stronger than 4 kg , and we can not exclude that individual stars can generate magnetic flux stronger than that .",
    "determining what sets the maximum value  whether equipartition with either the atmospheric pressure or the turbulent velocity field , or some more subtle effect  remains a challenge for future observations and theories .",
    "this work is based on observations from the w.m .",
    "keck observatory , which is operated as a scientific partnership among the california institute of technology , the university of california and the national aeronautics and space administration .",
