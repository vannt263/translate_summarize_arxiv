    "well before extrasolar planets were discovered , goldreich & tremaine ( 1979 ; 1980 ) and lin & papaloizou ( 1986a , b ) have speculated that tidal interactions between disks and embedded protoplanets would lead to planet migration .",
    "ward ( 1997 ) suggested that two different types of migration could occur .",
    "one , called type i migration , is when the protoplanet mass is still small enough that the migration rate can be evaluated using linear analysis and is shown to be quite fast in the sense that migration timescale is shorter than the estimated buildup timescale of a giant protoplanet core .",
    "this has presented a serious problem for the formation of giant planets .",
    "the other , called type ii migration , is when the protoplanet is massive enough that it opens gaps in the disk .",
    "the protoplanet is then locked into the disk s viscous evolution timescale , which is typically long .",
    "the discovery of extrasolar planets with a large number of short - period planets very close to their parent stars seems to support a migration scenario since it is more likely that giant planet formation takes place at larger distances outside the snow line .",
    "this has generated renewed interests in the study of tidally induced planet migration ( e.g. , kley 1999 ; lubow , seibert , & artymowicz 1999 ; nelson et al .",
    "2000 ; dangelo , kley , & henning 2003 ) . both types of migration have been basically confirmed by non - linear numerical simulations though most simulations to - date are performed with a prescribed viscosity .    a recent study by balmforth & korycansky ( 2001 ) focused on the evolution of potential vorticity in the co - orbital region of a planet and they noted the possibility of secondary instabilities in the corotation resonance region , which lead to the formation of vortices .",
    "they showed that nonlinear dynamics of the co - orbital region have an important influence on the saturation of the corotation torque .    in an earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we also investigated the nonlinear dynamics in the co - orbital region ( within @xmath0 roche lobe radii of the planet ) through global nonlinear 2d inviscid simulations .",
    "we found that the potential vorticity of the disk flow undergoes systematic changes , presumably caused by the spiral shocks generated by the planet though we did not give any detailed analysis of the shocks .",
    "we also found that the flow eventually becomes unstable due to the inflexion points in the potential vorticity profile .",
    "vortices are formed as a consequence .",
    "this paper is a close follow up to koller et al .",
    "our purpose is two fold .",
    "first , we present quantitative analyses of the ways that shocks change the potential vorticity of the flow .",
    "second , through extensive numerical resolution studies , we confirm the physical mechanism for exciting a secondary instability through inflexion points in the potential vorticity profile .",
    "however , we now find that the instability is excited at a different location from what koller et al .",
    "the phenomenon observed by koller et al .",
    "is apparently due to limited numerical resolutions , hence artificial .",
    "nevertheless we are still able to demonstrate the existence of such a secondary instability , and its impact on the planet s torque .",
    "we have also performed extensive numerical tests via different resolutions to check the validity of these new findings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe our numerical approach and how we set up our simulations in  [ sec : num ] and  [ sec : init ] .",
    "we then present the analyses on shocks and how they change the potential vorticity in ",
    "[ sec : shock ] .",
    "the excitation of a secondary instability is described in  [ sec : s_instab ] .",
    "the influence of numerical resolution is presented in ",
    "[ sec : resol ] .",
    "discussions are given in ",
    "[ sec : diss ] .",
    "we assume that the protoplanetary disk is thin and can be described by the inviscid two - dimensional isothermal euler equations in a cylindrical \\{@xmath1 } plane with vertically integrated quantities .",
    "the differential equations are the same as given in kley ( 1998 ) .",
    "simulations are carried out mostly using a split dimension hydro code ( li & li 2005 ) whose basic algorithm is based on the muscl - hancock scheme ( mhs ) ( toro 1999 ) .",
    "the methodology of mhs is extended here for the presence of source terms with two following main modifications : the fluxes are computed using primitive instead of conserved variables , where van leer flux limiter is applied to the slopes of the primitive variables , and an iterative approximate riemann solver is used .",
    "standard dimensional splitting as well as some source splitting are used .",
    "radial sweeps with the angular flux derivatives omitted are alternated with angular sweeps with the radial flux derivatives omitted .",
    "all source terms except the planet s gravitational force are included in the radial sweep .",
    "the planet force is applied in a separate sweep as the numerical gradient of the planet potential , so that the numerical curl of this gradient is zero , minimizing the potential vorticity contamination by the planet .",
    "we use the local co - moving angular sweep as proposed in the fargo scheme of masset ( 2000 ) and modified in li et al .",
    "the idea is basically to use a semi - lagrangian form for the transport terms in the angular sweep .",
    "a constant velocity is subtracted from the angular transport velocity .",
    "this velocity is chosen to be close to the mean angular velocity , in order to move the data an integral number of angular cells in one time step .",
    "this is then corrected by an integral shift of the data .",
    "this enables us to use a much larger time step than would otherwise be possible .",
    "the mhs scheme requires two ghost cells in the radial sweep ( the angular sweep is periodic ) . holding these ghost cells at the initial steady state",
    "produced the smallest boundary reflection of all boundary conditions tried .",
    "the two - dimensional disk is modeled between @xmath2 .",
    "the planet is assumed to be on a fixed circular orbit at @xmath3 . a co - rotating frame is used and the positions of the central star and the planet are fixed at @xmath4 and @xmath5 [ acceleration due to frame rotation is also included , see kley ( 1998 ) ] .",
    "the mass ratio between the planet and the central star is @xmath6 .",
    "its hill ( roche ) radius is @xmath7 .",
    "the disk is assumed as isothermal with a constant temperature throughout the simulation region .",
    "the isothermal sound speed , scaled by the keplerian rotation speed @xmath8 at @xmath3 , is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the disk scale height .",
    "time is measured by the orbital period at @xmath3 .",
    "we choose an initial surface density profile with @xmath11 , so that the ratio of vorticity to surface density , potential vorticity ( pv @xmath12 ) , has a flat radial profile @xmath13 .",
    "( note that @xmath14 has a small deviation from being precisely @xmath15 due to the finite pressure gradient which slightly modifies @xmath8 from its keplerian value . ) with this initial condition , we avoid the generation of inflection points due to the rearrangement of @xmath14 distribution as it is carried by the stream lines @xcite .",
    "we typically run the disk without the planet for 10 orbits first so that the disk is settled into a numerical equilibrium ( very close to the analytic one ) .",
    "then the planet s gravitational potential is gradually `` turned - on '' over a 10-orbit period , allowing the disk to respond to the planet potential gradually .",
    "furthermore , the planet s potential is softened by an approximate three - dimensional treatment .",
    "the basic idea is that , at any location \\{@xmath16 } , the matter with surface density @xmath17 is distributed ( divided into many cells ) vertically over many scale heights ( say @xmath18 ) according to a gaussian isothermal profile .",
    "radial and azimuthal forces exerted by the planet at a specific \\{@xmath19 } are calculated in this 3d fashion . to get the 2d radial and azimuthal forces for a specific \\{@xmath16 }",
    ", one then integrates all the cells along @xmath20 . comparing this pseudo-3d treatment with the usual 2d treatment where a fixed smoothing distance is used",
    ", we find that it reduces the force close to the planet ( within @xmath21 ) by about a factor of 2 but converges to the usual 2d force beyond @xmath22 .",
    "although there is some accumulation of gas near the planet , we do not allow any disk gas to be accreted onto it .",
    "self - gravity of the disk is not included .",
    "runs are made using several radial and azimuthal grids to study the influence of resolution , which ranges from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "simulations typically last several hundred orbits at @xmath3 .",
    "one key feature of our simulations is that they are performed at the inviscid limit , i.e. , we do not explicitly include a viscosity term , though numerical viscosity is inevitable and is needed to handle shocks .",
    "in addition , our simulations tend to be of higher resolution . with a radial @xmath25 ( some runs go up to @xmath26 ) and @xmath2 , the diameter of the hill sphere of a planet with @xmath27 is resolved by @xmath28 cells in each direction .",
    "we will use one run in this section to facilitate discussion .",
    "this run has @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and a @xmath31 resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : den_strm ] shows the surface density ( multiplied by @xmath32 so that the background surface density is unity initially ) in the \\{@xmath16 } plane at @xmath33 orbits .",
    "it shows the characteristic density enhancement at the planet and at the two spiral shocks .",
    "two density `` depressions '' at @xmath34 are developed as angular momentum is gradually deposited there .",
    "two density bumps ( enhancements ) occur broadly over @xmath35 . here , @xmath36 .",
    "some streamlines ( in the co - rotating frame ) are plotted as well .",
    "figure [ fig : pv_r ] shows the azimuthally averaged @xmath37 profile from @xmath38 and @xmath39 orbits .",
    "( the initial value @xmath40 is subtracted . )",
    "several features can be seen .",
    "first , there are very small changes in @xmath37 for @xmath41 .",
    "second , at larger distances from the planet , @xmath37 profile changes progressively with time and shows both increase and decrease from its initial value .",
    "an interesting feature is that even though both `` peaks '' and `` valleys '' are growing with time , two locations around @xmath42 have no change in @xmath37 .",
    "a natural question is what causes these features .",
    "the flow around the planet can be separated into several sub - regions depending on their streamline behavior ( e.g. , see masset 2002 ) , including the horseshoe ( or librating ) region with @xmath43 , the separatrix region @xmath44 , and the streaming region @xmath45 .",
    "typically , spiral shocks do not occur until the relative velocity between the disk flow and the planet becomes larger than the sound speed .",
    "this roughly translates to @xmath46 .",
    "so , a critical parameter is @xmath47 , which gives an indication whether the spiral shock is starting from within the planet s roche lobe or not ( see also korycanski & papaloizou 1996 ) . in the limit of small @xmath48 ,",
    "flow around the planet becomes quite complicated ( e.g. , see tanigawa & watanabe 2002 ) .",
    "another added yet potentially very important complication is that any numerical error coming out nearing the planet might be strongly amplified by these shocks , giving numerical artifacts which can be physically unreal .",
    "so , we have mostly used a relatively higher sound speed of @xmath49 in this study .",
    "higher sound speeds mean weaker shocks , which typically also mean slower changes in the disk properties .    as discussed in koller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , spiral shocks are capable of destroying the conservation of pv . for the parameters used in this run , we do not expect shocks within @xmath50 , which is confirmed by the fact that @xmath37 stays roughly at the initial value .",
    "once in the shocked region , we can use a very useful formula for calculating the pv jump across a ( curved ) shock , which is given in kevlahan ( 1997 ) , after some manipulation , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the perpendicular mach number ( @xmath53 ) which is equal to @xmath54 for isothermal shocks . @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the pre- and post - shock surface densities .",
    "the direction @xmath57 is tangential to the shock front and is defined to be pointing away from the planet . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dzeta ] ) , the sign of @xmath58 is determined only by the gradient of @xmath52 along the shock front .",
    "figure [ fig : machperp ] shows @xmath52 as a function of radial distance to the planet ( only one side is shown ) .",
    "this is obtained by first identifying the high compression region through calculating the velocity compression . after finding the flow impact angle to that surface ,",
    "one can then calculate @xmath52 at the shock .",
    "differentiating along that surface gives @xmath59 .",
    "this figure shows the general behavior of what one might expect of a spiral shock produced by the planet . as one moves radially away from the planet , the flow goes from a non - shocked state to having shocks , which means that @xmath52 gradually increases from being @xmath60 to @xmath61 when the shock actually starts . very far away from the planet ,",
    "the pitch angle between the spiral wave and the background flow becomes small enough that @xmath52 is expected to become less than one again .",
    "so , as a function of radial distance from the planet , @xmath52 is expected to increase first , reaching its peak , then starting to decrease , it eventually drops to be smaller than one at some large distance .",
    "consequently , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : dzeta ] ) , we can expect that @xmath58 should be positive first , becomes zero when @xmath52 reaching its peak , then is negative when @xmath52 is decreasing .",
    "this matches quite well with the behavior of @xmath37 given in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv_r ] . note that over the whole evolution , shocks are quite steady with very slow evolution , indicated by the small `` outward '' movement of the inflexion points ( where @xmath62 ) .",
    "all these features are quite generic and we have confirmed this by using several different planet masses .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : machperp ] , we can see that @xmath52 peaks at @xmath63 , but the point where @xmath64 is at @xmath65 based on fig .",
    "[ fig : pv_r ] .",
    "to quantitatively match the two profiles in terms of radial distances to the planet , one has to take into the account the fact that the radial location where shock occurs ( and the flow s pv is changed ) is _ different _ from where these pv changes are eventually deposited .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : den_strm ] . correcting for this systematic shift in radial locations ,",
    "the agreement between the azimuthally averaged @xmath37 profile and the @xmath52 profile is quite good .    to summarize , the spiral shocks emanating close to the planet cause systematic changes to the pv distribution of the disk flow .",
    "as the disk rotates , the disk flow repeatedly passes through these shocks so that changes in pv then accumulate .",
    "the sign of pv change is determined by the shock structure , and the amplitude of change is determined both by the shock structure [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : dzeta ] ) ] and how many times the flow passes through the shocks in a given time [ @xmath66 .",
    "we have identified the physical cause for having both positive and negative changes in pv , in addition to the existence of an inflexion point .",
    "we defer the quantitative comparison of the amplitude of pv changes between simulations and eq .",
    "( [ eq : dzeta ] ) to a future study .",
    "having established the profile of @xmath67 , we now turn to the issue of secondary instability .",
    "this type of instability is usually associated with the existence of inflexion points ( extrema ) in the pv profile ( see drazin & reid 1981 ) and often requires satisfying a threshold condition . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv_r ] , the pv profile has extrema points , and the magnitude of the slope between the peak at @xmath68 and the valley at @xmath69 is increasing with time ( similarly on the other side of the planet ) .",
    "it is then expected that these changes will become large enough that a threshold is reached and secondary instabilities will be excited .    to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have made runs out to several hundred orbits ( @xmath70 orbits depending on resolution ) .",
    "figure [ fig : pv_2d ] shows the evolution of pv in the \\{@xmath16 } plane for a run with @xmath71 , @xmath29 , and @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , a secondary instability is observed to occur in the outer `` valley '' of the pv profile at @xmath73 orbits .",
    "( the other valley in the @xmath74 region also becomes unstable at a later time . )",
    "the negative pv regions correspond to the two density bumps , which are roughly axisymmetric early on .",
    "when the instability is excited , density bumps break up into @xmath75 anticyclonic vortices ( even higher density blobs ) . over the next tens of orbits , as the instability evolves and saturates ,",
    "these density blobs merge , forming density enhancements that are non - axisymmetric on large scales .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : den ] at @xmath76 orbits .",
    "note that density depression regions also become non - axisymmetric .      as discussed in koller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , one primary goal of studying secondary instability is to understand its impact on the torque evolution of disk gas on the planet .",
    "figure [ fig : torque ] shows the torque history on the planet for a run with the same parameters as in figure [ fig : pv_2d ] .",
    "the rapid oscillations in the torque history starting at @xmath73 indicates the initiation of the instability ( consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : pv_2d ] ) .",
    "as the higher density blobs pass by the planet , they exert stronger torques .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : torque ] shows that the oscillation amplitude grows with time , which is caused by the gradual density increase in the pv `` valleys '' over long timescales .",
    "to better understand the origin of fast oscillations , we have calculated the torques separately from three different parts of the disk , which are inner : @xmath77 , middle : @xmath78 , and outer : @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : torq_det ] shows their individual contributions over a time interval from @xmath80 .",
    "we can see that both inner and outer regions have a periodic large amplitude variation .",
    "these are caused by the orbital motion of the non - axisymmetric disk flow at @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ( see fig . [",
    "fig : den ] ) .",
    "in fact , the torque oscillation periods from these two regions are precisely the expected orbital periods at those radii .",
    "since these two periods are different , their sum gives an erratic appearance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : torque ] ) .",
    "one might speculate that even with these large amplitudes and rapid oscillations , there seems to be a mean value that is negative and has a small amplitude , consistent with the type i migration expectations .",
    "but since our simulations have the planet moving on a fixed circular orbit , it is premature to conclude that these oscillations will not change the type i migration picture .",
    "studies allowing the planet to migrate under the influence of these oscillating torques is under way to address this important issue .    here",
    ", we have mostly concentrated on demonstrating the existence of such a secondary instability and its potential impact on the planet s torque .",
    "we have not quantitatively analyzed what is the threshold condition in the pv profile that excites this instability .",
    "such a threshold obviously depends on the planet mass , shock structure , sound speed of disk gas , and viscosity in the disk , etc .",
    "we have assumed the inviscid limit .",
    "sufficient viscosity could potentially remove the buildup of the pv s peaks and valleys made by shocks , hence never allowing the profile to reach the critical destabilization level .",
    "the results we presented here , especially figs . [ fig : pv_r ] and [ fig : pv_2d ] , are different from the findings in koller et al .",
    "( 2003 , see their fig .",
    "3 , also curve a in our fig . [",
    "fig : pv_resolu ] ) .",
    "results there showed additional `` dips '' interior ( i.e. , closer to the planet ) to the main positive peaks in @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , those `` dips '' were shown to deepen with time and eventually became unstable .",
    "figure [ fig : pv_resolu ] shows a comparison of runs with 4 different resolutions but the same set of physical parameters . even though different curves of @xmath37 converge at large @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) because the shock is weak and the gradient is small there , the behavior at small @xmath83 ( where the shock is strong ) shows large differences . comparing curves a and c ,",
    "for example , we can see that when the resolution is low and shocks are not well resolved , a larger part of the disk was affected ( see the region of @xmath85 in curve a ) .",
    "we were able to reproduce the results of koller et al . in our low - resolution runs but our high - resolution studies",
    "indicate that the `` dips '' observed in koller et al .",
    "are getting narrower and shallower with higher resolutions .",
    "this means that the previous results showing the inner `` dips '' are numerical artifacts , not true physical effects .",
    "note that the pv within the planet s roche lobe is not conserved due to both the switch - on of the planet s mass ( no matter how slowly ) and the numerical error in implementing the planet s potential .",
    "this is indicated by fig .",
    "[ fig : pv_two ] , where pv in the \\{@xmath16 } plane at @xmath33 is shown for two different resolutions .",
    "small pv changes are visible coming out of the planet region . for the low resolution case ,",
    "the pv change from the planet is `` spread '' over a wide region .",
    "it is then amplified by poorly resolved shocks .",
    "such amplification eventually leads to an instability , unfortunately , in much the same spirit we have discussed here . for the high resolution run , the shock and the pv change from the planet is well separated .",
    "the erroneous amplification does not occur .",
    "it is seen that very high resolutions ( @xmath86 to @xmath87 ) are needed to obtain convergence in the @xmath37 profile ( curves c and d ) .",
    "we emphasize that even though there are still some minor differences for the high resolution runs we presented here , the overall feature of having a positive peak and a negative valley is quite consistent among all resolutions .",
    "furthermore , the instability now comes out of the valley region , which typically has a much better convergence than other parts of the @xmath14 profile .",
    "in addition , we have also made a run using pure lax - wendroff scheme with @xmath88 ( curve e ) .",
    "comparing with curve c , it gives very similar results .",
    "it also shows the instability at later times ( not shown here ) , though the mhs scheme gives sharper and smoother shocks than hybrid schemes .",
    "we have carried out high - resolution two - dimensional hydrodynamic disk simulations with one embedded protoplanet .",
    "we find that the total torque on the planet , caused by tidal interactions between the disk and the planet , can be divided into two stages .",
    "first , it is negative , and slowly varying , consistent with the type i migration expectation .",
    "second , it shows large amplitude and very fast oscillations , due to the excitation of an instability which first breaks up the axisymmetric density enhancement into higher density blobs , e.g. , vortices . these vortices then merge , forming large - scale non - axisymmetric density enhancements .",
    "this non - axisymmetry causes the torque to continuously oscillate .    in koller",
    "et al . ( 2003 ) , we were misled by a spurious feature in the pv profile , due to an inadequate numerical resolution , which eventually became unstable . despite the inaccurate location where a secondary instability is initiated , the physical explanation proposed by koller et al .",
    "for exciting such an instability is well founded .",
    "we now have a self - consistent picture from performing very high resolution simulations to understand the shock structure and the pv profile .",
    "further studies allowing the planet to migrate under the influence of these torques will be necessary and very interesting ."
