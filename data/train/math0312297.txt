    "tropical algebraic geometry is the geometry of the tropical semiring @xmath0 .",
    "its objects are polyhedral cell complexes which behave like complex algebraic varieties .",
    "although this is a very new field in which many basic questions have not yet been addressed ( see @xcite for a nice introduction ) , tropical geometry has already been shown to have remarkable applications to enumerative geometry ( see @xcite ) , as well as connections to representation theory ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    the classical theory of total positivity concerns matrices in which all minors are positive .",
    "however , in the past decade this theory has been extended by lusztig ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , who introduced the totally positive variety @xmath11 in an arbitrary reductive group @xmath12 and the totally positive part @xmath13 of a real flag variety @xmath14 . in the process , lusztig discovered surprising connections between his theory of canonical bases for quantum groups and the theory of total positivity .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the totally positive part ( or positive part , for short ) of the tropicalization of an arbitrary affine variety over the ring of puiseux series , and then investigate what we get in the case of the grassmannian @xmath15 .",
    "first we give a parameterization of the totally positive part of the grassmannian , largely based on work of postnikov @xcite , and then we compute its tropicalization , which we denote by @xmath1 .",
    "we identify @xmath1 with a polyhedral subcomplex of the @xmath16-dimensional grbner fan of the ideal of plcker relations , and then show that this fan , modulo its @xmath17-dimensional lineality space , is combinatorially equivalent to an @xmath18-dimensional fan which we explicitly describe . as a special case , we show that @xmath2 is a fan which appeared in the work of stanley and pitman ( see @xcite ) , which parameterizes certain binary trees , and which is combinatorially equivalent to the ( type @xmath19 ) associahedron . we also show that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fans which are closely related to the fans of the types @xmath6 and @xmath7 associahedra , which were first introduced in @xcite .",
    "these results are strikingly reminiscent of the results of fomin and zelevinsky @xcite , and scott @xcite , who showed that the grassmannian has a natural cluster algebra structure which is of type @xmath19 for @xmath8 , type @xmath6 for @xmath9 , and type @xmath7 for @xmath10 .",
    "( fomin and zelevinsky proved the @xmath8 case and stated the other results ; scott worked out the cluster algebra structure of all grassmannians in detail . ) finally , we suggest a general conjecture about the positive part of the tropicalization of a cluster algebra .",
