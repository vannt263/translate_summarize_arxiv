    "roth s conjecture @xcite in the theory of finite groups asserts that the ad - representation of the group @xmath2 on itself contains every complex irreducible representation of @xmath3 at least once ( where @xmath4 is the centre ) .",
    "this conjecture is false in general , but is known to be true for symmetric groups @xcite and alternating groups @xcite , and , recently , for the sporadic simple groups @xcite using methods from @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to this property , when it holds , as the roth property .",
    "indeed , for simple groups the exceptions according to @xcite appear to be rather few and to amount to some instances of one classical family of lie type over finite fields of particular order . in this paper",
    "we provide a noncommutative - geometrical point of view on this property , relating it to the universal differential calculus on the finite group and nondegeneracy of the corresponding killing form ( these notions will be defined in the preliminaries section of the paper ) .",
    "nondegeneracy of the killing form here appears to be weaker than the roth property and we conjecture that it holds at least for all simple @xmath2 .    beyond this , we expect more strongly at least when @xmath2 is simple or @xmath0 that the killing form is nondegenerate quite generally , not only for the universal calculus . a general calculus on a finite group corresponds to an ad - stable subset @xmath5 with equality in the case of the universal calculus .",
    "here @xmath6 is the group identity .",
    "the killing form is defined on @xmath7 and in the case of finite groups reduces to the trace in the representation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a basis of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the character or trace in the representation @xmath10 . in our case",
    "the representation @xmath10 is given by the adjoint action hence @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the centraliser of @xmath14 . complementing the case of the universal calculus in section 3 , we focus next on the other extreme where @xmath15 is a single conjugacy class stable under group inversion ( such classes are called ` real ' as the character is real - valued ) .",
    "section 5 proves nondegeneracy for the natural 2-cycles calculus on symmetric groups @xmath0 while section  6 provides computer verification of this conjecture for real conjugacy classes up to @xmath16 some 75,000 .",
    "this includes the smallest sporadic group @xmath17 and the suzuki group @xmath18 .",
    "the geometric intuition is that when @xmath2 is simple _ any _ @xmath15 generates @xmath2 and hence could be viewed as some kind of ` lie algebra ' which we might hope to reflect the simplicity of @xmath2 .",
    "once we have a killing form , nondegenerate or not , we can envisage many applications . in usual lie theory",
    "complex simple lie algebras have up to equivalence a unique compact real form where the killing form is positive definite , leading in the geometry to a riemannian metric with constant positive curvature .",
    "the simplest finite group examples along these lines have been studied ` by hand ' and it was found , for example , that @xmath19 with its 2-cycles conjugacy class is an einstein space with ricci curvature essentially proportional to the metric , while @xmath20 with an order 4 conjugacy class is ricci flat @xcite . with such eventual geometry in mind , we are interested in when the matrix of @xmath21 in our basis @xmath15 is positive definite .",
    "the answer among real conjugacy classes appears to be precisely those which are classes of involutions .",
    "one of these could then be a natural ` compact ' braided lie algebra structure of a finite nonabelian simple group .",
    "we find moreover that the other real conjugacy have the interesting feature of equal numbers of positive and negative eigenvalues when counted with multiplicity .",
    "we will also provide first results and conjectures on the integrality , irreducibility and maximal eigenvalue of the killing form matrix , collected in section  4 .",
    "we also explore some ideas relating to the open problem of associating an irrep to a conjugacy class .",
    "the underlying idea is that for a simple lie algebra the adjoint representation is irreducible , so if a conjugacy class is like a ` lie algebra ' we might expect it to principally consist of an irrep when the group is simple or close to it ( such as the symmetric group ) .",
    "we are thus motivated to speculate that for @xmath0 and all simple groups where the roth property holds one can bijectively associate irreps to conjugacy classes containing them .",
    "we illustrate this in section 4 for @xmath22 and the mathieu group @xmath17 . in section  5",
    "we look in detail at @xmath0 , where we rapidly establish that such a bijection , if it exists , is not any obvious one such as taking the young diagram associated to a conjugacy class and constructing a specht module from the transposed diagram .",
    "however in section  [ signrep ] we find that the related question of which conjugacy classes contain the sign representation has a very natural answer .",
    "we note that a first attempt at a geometrical association between conjugacy classes and irreps via the differential calculus was made in @xcite and was equally tentative .",
    "an alternative strategy suggested by our positive - definiteness conjecture is to fix the noncommutative differential geometry as defined by such conjugacy class and to then view different conjugacy classes as leading to irreps in a less direct way as some kind of ` orbit method ' .",
    "finally , section 6 collects the computer data testing the ideas and conjectures in earlier sections on nonabelian finite simple groups up to order 75,000 .",
    "in this section we introduce the basic elements of noncommutative differential geometry of finite groups @xmath2 in the hopf algebraic approach .",
    "it is quite important that these constructions are not invented in an ad - hoc manner just for groups but that they are part of a general quantum groups approach to noncommutative differential geometry .",
    "suffice it to say on that front that differential structures over any unital algebra @xmath23 are expressed as a specification of the space @xmath24 of 1-forms as an @xmath25-bimodule equipped with a differential @xmath26 obeying the leibniz rule .",
    "we also require that the map @xmath27 sending @xmath28 is surjective and , optionally ( one says that the calculus is connected ) that @xmath29 is spanned by @xmath30 . when @xmath23 is a hopf algebra or ` quantum group ' we can require the calculus to be covariant under left or right translation , or both . in the latter case one says that the calculus is bicovariant .",
    "one knows that a ( say ) left - covariant calculus is a free module over its space @xmath31 of left - invariant differentials . in the bicovariant case",
    "there is a canonical extension to a full exterior algebra @xmath32 or ` noncommutative de rahm complex ' .",
    "every unital algebra has a universal differential calculus defined as @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the hopf algebra case",
    "it is automatically bicovariant .",
    "any other calculus is isomorphic to a quotient of the universal one .",
    "specialising these ideas , differential calculi on finite sets are in correspondence with directed graphs @xcite . in the case of a finite group @xmath2",
    "the left - covariant calculi are in correspondence with cayley graphs defined by non - empty @xmath35 with @xmath36 ( @xmath6 the group identity ) . here",
    "the edges are of the form @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "such a calculus is also right covariant ( hence ` bicovariant ' ) _ iff _",
    "@xmath15 is ad - stable .",
    "the basis of invariant 1-forms is @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are right translation and ` left - invariant derivative ' respectively .",
    "explicitly , @xmath44 in terms of kronecker @xmath45-functions at @xmath38 .",
    "the higher @xmath46 are determined in the simplest ` woronowicz ' formulation by skew - symmetrization with respect to a braiding operator @xmath47 the calculus is connected i.e. has @xmath48 iff the graph is connected , which is iff @xmath15 is a generating set .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an introduction to the theory .    a nontrivial application of this theory to finite groups appeared in @xcite where the exterior algebra was linked to the fomin - kirillov algebra arising in the study of the cohomology of flag varieties .",
    "the theme there is a kind of extension of schur - weyl duality to a duality between the geometry of the flag variety and that of the associated weyl group .    a finite group @xmath2 is simple _ iff _ all its bicovariant calculi are connected .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is simple and @xmath15 an ad - stable subset ( defining a bicovariant calculus ) .",
    "let @xmath49 the subgroup generated by @xmath15 .",
    "this is clearly normal and contains more than @xmath6 ( as @xmath15 is nonempty ) , hence @xmath50 and the calculus is connected .",
    "conversely , suppose that all nonempty ad - stable subsets @xmath15 generate @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath51 be normal and @xmath52 .",
    "this is an ad - stable subset and @xmath53 as @xmath54 is a normal subgroup , hence @xmath50 .",
    "next , in the case of finite sets , a morphism @xmath55 between two differential calculi ( a bimodule map forming a commutative triangle with the corresponding @xmath56 ) is fully determined if it exists .",
    "this is because @xmath57 and hence sends an edge of the graph @xmath58 of @xmath24 to the same edge in the graph @xmath59 of @xmath60 if this edge exists , or else to zero .",
    "hence such a map is a surjection iff @xmath61 . because of this",
    ", we see that @xmath15 being a conjugacy class corresponds to @xmath24 having no proper quotients .    in order to develop a lie theory , however , we need something slightly different .",
    "namely , we impose connectedness from the start and in this case the ` minimal ' differential calculus with no connected proper quotients is not necessarily given by a conjugacy class , for example , if the group is abelian .",
    "dually , @xmath15 could be required to be minimal but still generating .",
    "a _ minimal lie structure _ on a finite group @xmath2 means a minimal ad - stable generating subset @xmath35 .",
    "a minimal lie structure always exists , namely one can start with @xmath62 ( which defines the universal calculus ) , this is always ad - stable and clearly generates @xmath2 .",
    "we then remove elements of @xmath15 if possible until further removal is no longer possible .",
    "it does not contain @xmath6 as this could be removed and hence @xmath15 would not be minimal .    a finite group is simple _ iff _ every nontrivial conjugacy class is a minimal lie structure . in this case the two notions are equivalent .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is simple and @xmath15 a nontrivial conjugacy class . as @xmath63 is normal and nontrivial we see , as above , that @xmath15 generates @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that @xmath15 is not minimal , so there exists a proper ad - stable generating subset @xmath64 which , in particular , contradicts @xmath15 a conjugacy class .",
    "conversely , suppose that @xmath2 is a finite group such that every nontrivial conjugacy class is a minimal lie structure .",
    "let @xmath65 be a nontrivial normal subgroup and @xmath52 , which is therefore ad - stable .",
    "decompose this into nontrivial conjugacy classes and let @xmath66 be one of these .",
    "then by assumption @xmath66 is a minimal lie structure on @xmath2 , hence @xmath67 . but",
    "@xmath68 as @xmath69 was a subgroup , hence @xmath70 and hence @xmath50 .",
    "hence @xmath2 is simple .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath2 is simple and @xmath15 a minimal lie structure .",
    "if @xmath71 is a proper ad - stable subset then ( as above ) @xmath72 is a nontrivial normal subgroup and hence @xmath66 generates @xmath2 , which contradicts minimality . hence @xmath15 is a conjugacy class , nontrivial as does not contain @xmath6 .      in geometry the dual of the space @xmath31 of left - invariant differential 1-forms on a lie group",
    "has the structure of a lie algebra .",
    "the corresponding notion in the quantum groups approach to noncommutative differential geometry is that of a ` braided lie algebra ' @xcite .",
    "this is defined abstractly as an object @xmath10 in a braided monoidal category equipped with morphisms @xmath73:{{\\mathcal{l}}}{\\otimes}{{\\mathcal{l}}}\\to{{\\mathcal{l}}}$ ] ( the ` lie bracket ' ) and @xmath74 , @xmath75 forming a coalgebra in the category ( where @xmath76 is the trivial object ) , subject to several axioms . when the category is abelian , there is a certain quadratic ` enveloping algebra ' @xmath77 associated to the braided lie algebra and forming a bialgebra in the category . of further relevance to us is a ` braided killing form ' defined as the braided or categorical trace of two application of @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "the theory was invented particularly to solve the problem of what is the ` lie object ' underlying the standard drinfeld - jimbo quantum enveloping algebras @xmath78 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that at least for generic @xmath79 there is a braided lie algebra @xmath80 and an algebra surjection @xmath81 . in the classical limit @xmath82 where @xmath83 recovers the classical lie algebra in an extended form where @xmath84={\\rm id}$ ] and @xmath85=0 $ ] .",
    "an introduction to the theory is in @xcite .",
    "this theory was connected to noncommutative differential geometry in @xcite , where the general theorem is that for any ` inner ' bicovariant differential calculus @xmath24 on a coquasitriangular hopf algebra , there is a braided lie algebra @xmath10 isomorphic as an object in a braided category to @xmath86 .",
    "this is the case for all standard quantum group coordinate algebras @xmath87 $ ] and completes the picture above .",
    "the term ` inner ' refers to a bi - invariant 1-form @xmath88 that generates the exterior derivative in the form @xmath89 $ ] , a concept that has no analogue in classical differential geometry .",
    "one could view the classical limit @xmath83 as corresponding to a nonstandard higher order differential structure possible within noncommutative geometry .",
    "now let @xmath90 be a bicovariant differential calculus defined by an ad - stable subset @xmath15 and with space of left - invariant 1-forms @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath91 be dual basis to the classes of @xmath92 providing the basis of @xmath31 .",
    "the bi - invariant element @xmath93 makes the calculus inner and the associated ` braided lie bracket ' on @xmath94 is @xmath95=x_{aba^{-1}}$ ] .",
    "the coproduct and counit take the form @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the category is that of @xmath2-modules with trivial braiding , the usual ` flip ' .",
    "the associated ` enveloping algebra ' @xmath77 is a quadratic algebra with generators @xmath91 and relations @xmath98 .",
    "this comes equipped with a canonical homomorphism @xmath99 to the group algebra , defined by @xmath100 . in our case",
    "because the underlying braiding is trivial the braided trace becomes the usual trace .",
    "then the killing form is @xmath101)=| z(ab)\\cap { { \\mathcal{c}}}|=\\chi_{{\\mathcal{l}}}(ab)\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the centraliser of @xmath14 and @xmath11 is the character of the conjugation representation on @xmath10 .",
    "clearly @xmath21 is ad - invariant since @xmath15 is and is @xmath102-symmetric , hence @xmath103 .",
    "it is also actually symmetric since @xmath104 since @xmath11 is a class function .",
    "we are interested in when @xmath21 is nondegenerate .",
    "if @xmath105 for some nontrivial @xmath106 then @xmath21 is degenerate . in particular , if @xmath107 then @xmath21 is degenerate .",

    "if @xmath112 are distinct then @xmath113 fits the first part .    if @xmath114 and @xmath115 then the killing form for the universal calculus is degenerate .    for the universal calculus @xmath62 and in the preceding lemma we can take any nontrivial @xmath106 , any @xmath116 and @xmath108 . then @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath2 has order 2 then @xmath21 _ is _ a @xmath118 matrix and _ is _ nondegenerate .",
    "we therefore only need to investigate the universal calculus in the case where @xmath114 and @xmath119 , for example when @xmath2 is simple and nonabelian .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite group .",
    "we are going to work from the expression ( [ killing ] ) derived above , and we note first that this formulation actually makes sense for a ` killing form ' similarly defined for any representation @xmath120 and on all of @xmath121 , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a basis of @xmath121 .",
    "it is well - known that such a symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate if and only if @xmath120 contains every irrep of @xmath2 with positive multiplicity .",
    "this follows from semisimplicity of the group algebra @xmath121 and general facts about semisimple algebras .",
    "( namely , if an algebra is semisimple then it is a direct sum of matrix blocks . if @xmath124 for some multiplicities @xmath125 then @xmath126 has a block form with @xmath125 times the euclidean inner product on each matrix block .",
    "this is because an element in a matrix block corresponding to an irrep acts as zero by left multiplication on any other block and hence in any other irrep .",
    "hence @xmath126 is nondegenerate iff all the @xmath127 ) .",
    "the case @xmath128 with the conjugation representation is therefore nondegenerate",
    "the conjugation representation contains every irrep .",
    "if @xmath4 is trivial then this is the roth property .",
    "for the case of the universal calculus we are interested in the case @xmath129 where we remove the group identity .",
    "we are also interested in restricting the killing form to @xmath130 but we defer this for the moment .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite group .",
    "suppose @xmath121 under conjugation contains every irreducible of @xmath2 with strictly positive multiplicity .",
    "then so does @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath120 spanned by set @xmath131 still contains a copy of the trivial representation since this set is permuted by conjugation and hence the element @xmath132 , where we sum over @xmath133 , is invariant .",
    "as @xmath134 as a @xmath2-module , if any nontrivial representation is contained in @xmath121 then it must also be in @xmath120 .",
    "hence if the roth property holds for @xmath2 then it also holds for our particular @xmath120 of interest .",
    "let @xmath1 be the number of distinct irreducible representations of @xmath2 , and call these representations @xmath135 .",
    "[ prop ] let @xmath2 be a finite group and @xmath120 be a representation of @xmath2 for which every irreducible representation @xmath136 appears in @xmath120 with strictly positive multiplicity .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath126 to @xmath137 is nondegenerate .    since the form @xmath126 is nondegenerate on @xmath121 we know that @xmath138 is one - dimensional",
    ". we will know that @xmath126 is nondegenerate in @xmath130 if there is no element in the perpendicular which also lies @xmath130 .",
    "we prove this by determining explicitly a vector spanning the line @xmath138 , and observing that it does nt lie in @xmath130 .",
    "define @xmath139 this is well - defined since @xmath140 for all @xmath141 by our assumption .",
    "we claim that @xmath142 for all @xmath143 .",
    "note that the coefficient of @xmath144 in @xmath145 is given by the formula @xmath146 so is always strictly positive .",
    "therefore @xmath145 does not lie in @xmath130 and the claim will imply the proposition .",
    "we use the following standard orthogonality formulas : @xmath147 and @xmath148 note also that @xmath149 now we can compute , extending linearly , @xmath150 the last expression vanishes whenever @xmath143 by .    let @xmath2 be a finite group for which the roth property holds . then the killing form for the universal differential calculus on @xmath151 is nondegenerate .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the roth property holds for most simple nonabelian groups including all the sporadic ones , see @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the simplest example where the roth property holds is @xmath152 , the group of permutations on three elements . this is elementary enough that we can , instructively , compute everything in our characters approach by hand . here",
    "@xmath4 is trivial .",
    "let @xmath152 .",
    "the killing form on @xmath121 is @xmath153 in a basis @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "we obtained by writing out the group product table and evaluated @xmath156 for each entry @xmath157 . here",
    "@xmath158 one can then see by computation that the lower right @xmath159 block in @xmath126 is invertible as required by the proposition . to see how this arises from the character theory in the proposition , we look at the trivial representation @xmath160 , the sign ( parity function ) representation @xmath161 and the standard 2-dimensional representation , denoted @xmath162 .",
    "their character values tabulated on conjugacy classes as for @xmath163 are @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath166 from which we see that @xmath167 .",
    "thus the ` roth property ' holds for @xmath120 as in the lemma above , hence @xmath126 on @xmath121 is nondegenerate .",
    "we also view this last table as the change of basis with the characteristic class functions @xmath168 with support @xmath169 , @xmath170 with support @xmath171 and @xmath172 with support @xmath173 .",
    "now , by direct computation it is clear that @xmath174 viewed as the coefficients of an element of @xmath121 lies in @xmath175 and hence spans this 1-dimensional space . using the table to convert back to the basis of characters ,",
    "we have obtained ` by hand ' an element @xmath176 in the perpendicular complement .",
    "this agrees up to normalisation with the canonical element constructed in the proof of the proposition , namely @xmath177 where the coefficient of @xmath178 is @xmath179 .",
    "finally , @xmath180 has by construction a non - zero coefficient of @xmath6 , so @xmath180 does not lie in @xmath130 .",
    "in fact we conjecture that the conclusion of proposition  [ prop ] holds even when the roth property fails .",
    "[ conjuni ] let @xmath2 be a finite simple nonabelian group and @xmath21 the killing form for the universal differential calculus .",
    "then @xmath21 is nondegenerate .",
    "experimental evidence that this holds for the finite simple groups beyond those implied by proposition  [ prop ] is limited as even the smallest of the simple groups such as @xmath181 where the roth property is known to fail in @xcite require too much computer memory to check directly .",
    "however , we will have evidence for a more general conjecture where the roth property for the relevant representation and hence proposition  [ prop ] do not apply but where the killing form is still nondegenerate .",
    "in particular , we will see in section  6 that nondegeneracy holds for all conjugacy class differential calculi on @xmath181 . also , just as the roth property holds more generally than for certain simple groups , eg for @xmath19 above , we similarly further conjecture that the nondegeneracy may hold more generally for finite groups with trivial centre .",
    "finally , we also conjecture nondegeneracy at the other extreme of ` minimal ' differential calculi .",
    "note that for a simple group any conjugacy class will be generating and define a connected differential calculus .",
    "[ conjcon ] let @xmath2 be a finite simple nonabelian group and @xmath5 a conjugacy class closed under inversion .",
    "then the killing form @xmath21 on @xmath182 is nondegenerate .",
    "this is verified by computer in section  5 for groups up to order 75,000 .",
    "this includes the first sporadic group @xmath17 and the exceptional group of lie type @xmath18 . the requirement on having inverses is included since the experimental evidence shows examples of conjugacy classes without this assumption and where @xmath21 is degenerate ,",
    "although those examples are scarce and generally one has nondegeneracy even without requiring closure under inversion .",
    "conjecture  [ conjcon ] and our previous conjecture  [ conjuni ] suggest further that nondegeneracy holds for simple @xmath2 and any ad - stable subset @xmath5 closed under inverses , but we have no direct evidence for this .",
    "we also further conjecture that nondegeneracy can hold more generally for groups which may have centre but where @xmath183 is empty and @xmath15 generates the group . for example , @xmath0 with its 2-cycles conjugacy class ( which generates the group ) has nondegenerate killing form yet the analogue of the ` roth property ' clearly does not hold for @xmath184 as most irreps are not contained in it .",
    "we will prove these assertions in section  5 , but for now we directly look at the simplest case of @xmath19 to illustrate why we require @xmath15 to generate the group .    for @xmath152 and @xmath15 the order 3 conjugacy class of 2-cycles ( which generates the group )",

    "@xmath2 acting by conjugation permutes the elements of @xmath185 and hence @xmath186 .",
    "this does not have the roth - type property used in proposition  [ prop ] and indeed on @xmath121 we have @xmath187 on the three classes and hence @xmath188 in basis order @xmath189 as before , which is degenerate .",
    "however , the @xmath190 submatrix arising from its restriction to @xmath15 is a multiple of the euclidean inner product @xcite and is invertible .",
    "incidentally , its restriction to the other class and to the union of the two nontrivial classes is also nondegenerate .    for @xmath152 and @xmath15 the order @xmath191 conjugacy class of 3-cycles ( which does not generate the group ) , the killing form is degenerate .",
    "here each element @xmath192 acts to flip the elements of @xmath15 while @xmath193 of course act trivially .",

    "otherwise the killing form has zero signature ( i.e. the same number of positive and negative eigenvalues counted with multiplicities ) .",

    "uniqueness is not true in general , since various simple groups ( eg . the altenating groups @xmath255 for @xmath256 ) contain several different conjugacy classes of involutions .",
    "there are also some examples , see the conjugacy classes 3a and 3b in @xmath257 in section  6 , that yield positive definite killing forms without being closed under inverses .",
    "we also expect a behaviour similar to the conjectured one to hold for groups such as @xmath0 with @xmath15 generating , see the next section .",
    "the second part of conjecture  [ conpos ] is not supported by the analogy but it perhaps reminiscent of the split real form in lie theory . finally , bearing in mind that a braided - lie algebra in the case of a classical lie group has the form @xmath258 where @xmath259 is in the adjoint representation and is irreducible when the lie group is simple",
    ", we might hope that @xmath182 will decompose in a similar way and that this might produce an irreducible representation analogous to @xmath259 after removal of the trivial representation .",
    "this is not exactly what happens but we propose to use the killing form to pick out an irreducible component in @xmath182 , and we shall explore this for @xmath0 with its 2-cycles class in the next section . by thinking of any conjugacy class as a braided - lie algebra and using the killing form we might hope to associate irreps to conjugacy classes in a natural way .",
    "this is not so much a matter of precise conjectures at the moment but a programme in the form of a couple of ` principles ' which we propose .",
    "( nondegeneracy principle . ) for large finite nonabelian simple groups @xmath2 the decomposition into eigenspaces of @xmath21 is typically into irreps or into complex conjugate pairs of irreps .",
    "this is certainly not always true but we shall see how it works for the @xmath17 group . note that the strong form stated implies that where an irrep occurs with multiplicity then these copies are generally distinct as well , i.e. @xmath21 typically resolves or ` separates ' the isotypical components in the process .",
    "( correspondence principle . )",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite nonabelian simple group for which roth s property holds .",
    "there is often a ` reasonable ' way up to choice of galois and complex conjugates to bijectively assign nontrivial irreps to non - trivial conjugacy classes containing them in the conjugation representation , in such a way that if a complex irrep is assigned to a conjugacy class not stable under inversion then its complex conjugate is assigned to the inverse class , and where possible the assigned irrep occurs without multiplicity .",
    "we certainly find examples where avoiding multiplicities is not possible , and in this case a weaker requirement is to have a distinct eigenvalue of @xmath21 for the chosen irrep or complex conjugate pair of irreps .",
    "@xmath260 @xmath261    table 1 provides a first impression by looking at @xmath22 . we used sage and some deductive reasoning to determine the decomposition of conjugacy classes into irreps and their eigenvalues .",
    "there are some accidental degenerations , one of them because @xmath21 is reducible , but otherwise the eigenspaces of @xmath21 are irreps or sums of ` conjugate ' irreps ( though not in this case complex conjugate ) . and in the last column we have also selected an irrep to associate to each conjugacy class in such a way that there is a 1 - 1 correspondence .",
    "this is a more or less unique assignment if we want the 5 and the 4 to enter in their respective conjugacy classes without multiplicity and _ if _ we intuitively require the ` conjugate ' pair of 5-cycle classes to map to the ` galois conjugate ' pair of irreps ( which of the pair of classes is assigned to which of @xmath262 is a residual ambiguity ) .",
    "the eigenvalues have been deduced from the knowledge ( see above ) that the trivial representation has maximal eigenvalue followed by comparison of dimensions between eigenspaces and irreps .",
    "this method does not fully identify the eigenvalue when distinct irreps with the same dimension occur , but in the case of @xmath262 this is a matter of definition as to which is called which . however , having defined one as @xmath263 one may verify by explicit calculation that it appears in the last line of the table with the other eigenvalue .",
    "the eigenvalues in these classes are not integer and indeed the eigenspaces are examples of real irrational representations ( however , when they both appear with the same eigenvalue then this is an integer ) . also note that there is a unique conjugacy class where @xmath21 is positive definite and the equal dimensions of the combined positive and negative eigenspaces in each of the other cases .",
    "we contrast both features with @xmath20 , also in the table , where aside from the trivial representations all eigenvalues are zero .",
    "note that @xmath20 is _ not _ simple and indeed there is no way to associate nontrivial irreps and nontrivial conjugacy classes containing them .",
    "table 2    @xmath264    illustrates that the same ideas hold in the simplest sporadic group , @xmath17 , again using sage and deductive reasoning to construct the table . here",
    "again we find for the most part that the eigenspace decomposition is generally a decomposition into irreps or conjugate pairs of irreps ( the sole exception is the 10,11 irreps in the class @xmath265 ) .",
    "we use atlas labelling of conjugacy classes as in section  6 .",
    "we also find a more or less unique 1 - 1 correspondence between conjugacy classes and irreps as shown , as follows .",
    "we see as explained above that inverse pairs of conjugacy classes have the same spectrum and for any complex conjugate pair of irreps if one occurs in a conjugacy then so must the other and with the same eigenvalue . in view of this , inverse pairs of classes",
    "are naturally assigned to a pair of complex conjugate irreps as shown ( which of each pair goes to which is then largely a matter of definition ) .",
    "this forces us to assign @xmath266 as shown as it does not occur in the other inverse pair , and hence @xmath267 to that .",
    "both then occur without multiplicity . of the remaining nontrivial irreps",
    "the only one which occurs without multiplicity in the 2nd row of the table is 11 , so we are led to assign that . similarly in the class @xmath268 , only the 10 occurs without multiplicity so we assign that . of the remaining classes",
    "only the 55 appears in the class @xmath265 without multiplicity , so we assign that .",
    "however , the assignment of the 44 and 45 is not determined by these arguments and this represents the residual ambiguity .",
    "they both occur with multiplicity in the remaining two conjugacy classes .",
    "one of these , the @xmath269 , has no nontrivial irreps occurring with integer eigenvalues at all , so this provides no guide either .",
    "note also the unique conjugacy class @xmath265 that has positive definite @xmath21 and the equal dimensions of the combined positive and negative eisgenspaces in each of the other classes , other than the mutually inverse pair @xmath270 and the mutually inverse pair @xmath271 .",
    "table  2 also shows the need for a more compact account of the killing form eigenvalues and we do this in figure  1 in the form of a spectrogram .",
    "this shows all the eigenvalues of the irreps occurring in the various conjugacy classes together as an overall picture or bar - code of the group , as well as an example of the contribution from just one class .",
    "complex conjugates have the same spectrum so we do not list them and the thickness of lines indicates a preponderance of nearby eigenvalues .",
    "the combined spectrum is that of the direct sum @xmath272 of all the different @xmath21 acting on a hilbert space @xmath273 which is the direct sum of all the spans of conjugacy classes .",
    "the latter if we include the span of @xmath169 carries a faithful representation of the algebra of functions @xmath151 and the triple @xmath274 can be viewed as a discrete ` spectral triple ' cf . @xcite",

    "we can indeed do something similar whenever @xmath21 is nondegenerate .    when the killing form @xmath21 is nondegenerate we let @xmath282 be its inverse matrix in basis @xmath15",

    "we can of course use its values to induce a labelling of irreducibles . in the case of @xmath0",
    "this is hardly necessary but could be useful for other finite groups equipped with nondegenerate killing form , much as in lie theory . on the other hand we can also decompose @xmath15 in terms of other ` @xmath88 elements ' consisting of sums over other conjugacy classes .",
    "so this coordinatisation is a change of basis from using the various @xmath88 for different conjugacy classes , i.e. from using the so - called ` central characters ' for the pairing of an irrep with a conjugacy class . here",
    "the value of @xmath286 in an irrep @xmath206 is given by @xmath287 however , more geometrically , the action of the quadratic casimir is the laplace - beltrami operator and this is analogous to the ability to view a classical quadratic differential as a ` linear ' differential with respect to a different ( noncommutative ) differential calculus .",
    "for @xmath22 with its 2 - 2-cycles calculus we have @xmath21 reducible into 5 identical @xmath190 blocks @xmath245 in a suitable basis order , with inverse of each block @xmath288 from this one finds @xmath289 involving the same conjugacy class as defining the calculus .",

    "although we are primarily interested in simple groups , the symmetric groups are so sufficiently close and more readily computable that they are useful as a first indication . also in noncommutative geometry @xmath19 in particularly with its 2-cycles class has the same noncommutative de rham cohomology as @xmath293 $ ] and has the flavour of some kind of discrete model of that . in this section",
    "we develop our theory for general @xmath0 .",
    "first we note that in the case of @xmath0 for @xmath294 , with the 2-cycles conjugacy class , one can see from the formulae for the killing form in @xcite that @xmath21 itself has all entries strictly positive .",

    "our main result in this section is , for @xmath0 with its 2-cycles class , an explicit decomposition of @xmath182 into irreducible representations in a manner compatible with the eigenspace decomposition under @xmath21 .",
    "we also find explicit formulae for the eigenvalues . as an application",
    "we obtain that the killing form matrix @xmath21 for this conjugacy class is positive definite .    additionally at the end of the section we give a complete analysis for which conjugacy classes contain the sign representation .",
    "first recall that irreducible representations of @xmath0 , called the specht modules , are indexed by partitions @xmath295 , and a partition is represented by its _ young diagram _ or _",

    "of course the trivial representation embeds into @xmath356 as the subspace spanned by the element @xmath357 , and has multiplicity @xmath30 .    for the standard representation @xmath352 we consider the subspace @xmath358 of @xmath359 for @xmath217 from corresponding to the tableau    @xmath360    1&2&3&@xmath361 & @xmath362 @xmath1    this is the submodule of @xmath182 obtained by applying @xmath363 to the vector @xmath364 . up to an overall multiple , which we drop",
    ", this vector works out to be @xmath365 since @xmath366 we have found a copy of @xmath352 in @xmath182 .    for the next representation @xmath354 we consider the subspace @xmath367 of @xmath182 for @xmath217 from and the tableau    @xmath368    1 & 2&3&@xmath361 & @xmath369  & @xmath1    this is the submodule of @xmath182 obtained by applying @xmath363 to the vector @xmath370 .",
    "up to an overall multiple this vector works out to be @xmath371 and since @xmath372 we have found a copy of @xmath354 in @xmath182 .",
    "that we have thereby completely decomposed @xmath182 follows by dimension count : @xmath373 where @xmath374 is computed for example by the hook formula .",
    "( a prettier proof of the above sum decomposition for @xmath375 into dimensions of specht modules goes via symmetric functions ) .",
    "this concludes the proof of ( 1 ) .",
    "that the irreducible subrepresentations lie in eigenspaces of @xmath21 follows immediately from the fact that in the decomposition of @xmath182 each irreducible representation occurs with multiplicity at most one .",
    "we can now compute the eigenvalues .    for the trivial representation we compute the column sum @xmath376 over all 2-cycles .",
    "in the basis of the ` triangular ' listing @xmath377 @xmath378 @xmath379 @xmath380 @xmath381 @xmath382 we have for @xmath246 the choice ( 12 ) , or @xmath246 lies in the size @xmath383 region on the left where @xmath246 has one entry in common with ( 12 ) , or @xmath246 lies in the triangle to the right of size @xmath384 where @xmath246 is disjoint from ( 12 ) . using the values of @xmath21 for these three cases in @xcite , we find @xmath385 which computes as stated .    for the standard representation we use the vector we constructed in the proof of ( 1 ) , @xmath386 which involves the left and bottom slopes of the triangle leaving out the common vertex .",
    "then the eigenvalue computed as the coefficient of @xmath387 in @xmath388 is @xmath389 @xmath390 which comes out as stated .",
    "both formulae , although computed for @xmath294 in the above counting , also give the right answer for @xmath391 , as computed by hand .    for the representation @xmath354 we use the vector @xmath392 from the proof of ( 1 ) and compute the eigenvalue as the @xmath387 coefficient of @xmath393 ,",
    "i.e. as @xmath394 @xmath395    the killing form for @xmath0 , @xmath343 with the 2-cycles conjugacy class @xmath15 is non - degenerate and in fact positive definite .",
    "moreover the decomposition of @xmath182 into irreps consisting of the trivial and the standard representation , and the representation @xmath354 , coincides for @xmath396 with the decomposition of @xmath21 into eigenspaces of respectively the maximal , next to maximal and smallest eigenvalues .",
    "looking at the three expressions for the eigenvalues in the lemmas above it is evident that they have different leading powers of @xmath1 and hence are distinct for all @xmath1 bigger than some value . by inspection ,",
    "the only degeneracies are @xmath345 when the trivial and the standard representation have the same eigenvalue of @xmath21 , @xmath397 when the eigenvalues of the trivial and the @xmath354 coincide , being smaller than the eigenvalue of the standard representation , and @xmath398 when the eigenvalues of the standard representation and of @xmath354 coincide .",
    "after that , the eigenvalue of the trivial exceeds that of the standard representation which exceeds that of @xmath354 as stated .",
    "as all the eigenvalues are positive we conclude that @xmath21 is non - degenerate ( and positive definite when extended as a hermitian inner product ) .",
    "one useful application of the k eigenvalue decomposition is that when it succeeds it directly provides subspaces of the conjugacy class representation which decompose it into irreps , just by linear algebra and entirely bypassing combinatorics .",
    "we illustrate this for @xmath306 and this also serves as a direct check of the above .",
    "[ example ] for @xmath306 with its 2-cycles conjugacy class , we use the explicit formula for the killing form in @xcite and mathematica to compute the eigenvalues and eigenspaces .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath399 the unique ` perron - frobenius ' eigenvector for the @xmath400 eigenvalue is @xmath88 as it must be .",
    "the eigenvectors for the 19 eigenvalue are , with @xmath401 , @xmath402 @xmath403 @xmath404 @xmath405 @xmath406 @xmath407 in a basis ordered as above . on inspection",
    "we can see that conjugation by @xmath408 interchanges the @xmath409 as in the standard representation namely @xmath410 and fixing the others , etc .",
    "the action of @xmath411 is more complicated and comes out as @xmath412 for @xmath413 and @xmath414 where @xmath415 this obeys @xmath416 .",
    "we now change to a new basis @xmath417 which does not change the form of the action of @xmath418 by transposition but now @xmath419 for @xmath413 .",
    "we define @xmath420 to identify the representation as the standard one embedded in @xmath421 .",
    "the eigenvectors for the 14 eigenvalue can similarly be seen to form an irrep , the @xmath354 one .",
    "apart from accidental degeneracies and reversals for small @xmath1 , we see that the next - to - maximal eigenvalue associates to the 2-cycles conjugacy class the standard representation , which is the specht module associated to the transposition of the young diagram describing the conjugacy class .",
    "such an association also assigns the trivial representation to the trivial conjugacy class as expected .",
    "the methods we have developed are general and can be applied in principle to other conjugacy classes allowing us to study which if any irreps are picked out in a stable range with a view towards extending such a 1 - 1 correspondence .",
    "such an extended correspondence , however , can not be the obvious one because we find that not every specht module is actually embeddable in the adjoint representation of the ` expected ' conjugacy class under the association given by transposition of the young diagram .",
    "specifically , we show in section  [ signrep ] that the sign representation does not occur in the @xmath1-cycle class for all even @xmath1 . at least for small @xmath1 we can see , however , that an extended correspondence is possible .",
    "a complete analysis for @xmath422 using methods as above is summarised in table 1 .",
    "one could obtain these results from sage but here we obtain them as an illustration of the general theory above to conjugacy classes of different shape .",
    "we focus on @xmath290 and we first realise the relevant specht modules @xmath299 as submodules of the left regular representation @xmath423 explicitly as @xmath424 @xmath425 these give rise to explicit embeddings of these specht modules into the conjugation representation as follows .    1 .   for the @xmath426-cycle conjugacy class in @xmath290 we have an explicit embedding of the specht module @xmath427 given by applying @xmath313 to the vector @xmath428 as this vector is non - zero , this 2-dimensional representation is contained and by adding up the dimensions @xmath429 next , the killing form matrix has all entries 3 because the product of any 2 - 2-cycles here is another 2 - 2-cycle and all elements of the commute .",
    "hence @xmath430 so this module has zero eigenvalue .",
    "2 .   for the @xmath263-cycle conjugacy class in @xmath290",
    "we similarly find @xmath431 with explicit embeddings of the specht modules @xmath432 and @xmath433 given by applying @xmath313 to the non - zero vectors @xmath434 @xmath435 @xmath436 next , all products of 2-cycles are either @xmath6 , a 3-cycle or a 2 - 2-cycle and we compute the number of fixed points ( the character of the conjugation representation ) as @xmath437 respectively .",
    "hence the killing form in basis order @xmath438 comes out as @xmath439 denoting by @xmath440 the stated eigenvector taken without any overall factor , we compute the eigenvalue from the coefficient of ( 123 ) in @xmath441 .",
    "for example , in the first case @xmath442 .",
    "3 .   for the @xmath443-cycle conjugacy class in @xmath290",
    "we similarly find @xmath444 with the explicit embeddings of the specht modules @xmath445 and @xmath446 given by applying @xmath313 to the non - zero vectors @xmath447 @xmath448    this time products of 4-cycles are either @xmath6 , 2 - 2-cycles or 3-cycles with number of fixed points or character values 6,2,0 respectively .",
    "hence the killing form in basis order @xmath449 is @xmath450 we use the eigenvectors @xmath440 above without the overall factors and compute the eigenvalue as the coefficient of @xmath451 in @xmath452 .",
    "for example , in the first case @xmath453 .",
    "looking as the tables we see that for @xmath19 the ` expected ' correspondence holds but the eigenvalues of @xmath21 are degenerate in the case of 2-cycles ( as above ) . for @xmath290 there are also some eigenvalue degeneracies and the 4-cycle representation does not contain the ` expected ' specht module @xmath454 . on the other hand ,",
    "we see that a different assignment of irreps to conjugacy classes is possible in such a way as to give a 1 - 1 correspondence between irreps and conjugacy classes .",
    "@xmath455 @xmath456    we end with a couple of more concrete conjectures for @xmath0 based on limited computer verification to @xmath457 .",
    "they remain a topic for further work .    for @xmath0 , @xmath294",
    "the conjugacy classes with reducible @xmath21 are precisely the @xmath458-fold @xmath191-cycles for @xmath1 odd . in this case",
    "the maximal eigenvalue has eigenspace decomposition @xmath459 , where @xmath460 is the standard representation .    for all @xmath0 , @xmath294",
    "all conjugacy classes have non - degenerate @xmath21 and of these precisely @xmath461 $ ] are positive definite , namely the classes of @xmath145-fold 2-cycles class for @xmath462 $ ] .",
    "here @xmath463 $ ] denotes integer part .",
    "all the other classes have evenly split signature .",
    "note that of the positive - definite classes , the 2-cycles remain the more natural one for the ` compact real form ' of the braided lie algebra of @xmath0 , with the others viewed as defining higher order differential calculi .",
    "not much is known about decomposition of the conjugation representation of @xmath0 into irreducible representations other than roth s property , that every irreducible representation occurs @xcite if @xmath343 , and some asymptotic estimates for the multiplicities @xcite .",
    "the more detailed question of which conjugacy classes a given irreducible representation occurs in looks even more complicated in general .",
    "however for the sign representation we can give a complete answer , which we do here .",
    "first we explain briefly the overall multiplicity of the sign representation in the conjugation representation @xmath313 . by character theory",
    "this multiplicity is precisely the number of conjugacy classes consisting of even permutations minus the number of conjugacy classes of odd permutations ( the row sum in the character table , for the sign representation ) . in analogy with euler s product formula for the number of all partitions ,",
    "one can write a generating function for these multiplicities .    namely , if @xmath464 is the multiplicity of the sign representation in @xmath313 , then the above description of @xmath464 implies @xmath465 clearly , multiplying out the right - hand side of the formula above , we get a contribution @xmath466 to @xmath467 for every partition of @xmath1 .",
    "namely the contribution is @xmath468 for every partition of @xmath1 with an even number of even parts and @xmath469 for every partition of @xmath1 with an odd number of even parts .",
    "the former are in bijection with conjugacy classes of even elements , and the latter with conjugacy classes of odd elements .",
    "this proves the identity .    by the classical euler identity which reads ( after replacing the usual variable by @xmath470 and inverting ) ,",
    "@xmath471 it follows that the multiplicity of the sign representation in the conjugation representation @xmath313 is equal to the number of partitions of @xmath1 into distinct odd parts .",
    "we refine this observation in the following proposition , which could alternatively be viewed as giving a representation theoretic proof of the euler identity .",
    "[ p : signrep ] the sign representation of @xmath0 appears as a subrepresentation of the conjugation representation @xmath337 if and only if @xmath323 is a partition of @xmath1 into distinct odd parts . if it appears in @xmath337 , then it has multiplicity one .",
    "since the sign representation has multiplicity one in in the left - regular representation @xmath313 and the conjugation representation @xmath337 is a cyclic @xmath313-module , it is clear that the sign representation can have multiplicity at most @xmath30 in @xmath337 .",
    "let us now write @xmath472 for the conjugation action .",
    "fix an element @xmath326 in the conjugacy class @xmath473 . by lemma  [ l : spechtembeddings",
    "] , the sign representation appears in @xmath474 if and only if the element @xmath475 in @xmath474 is nonzero .",
    "moreover if it is nonzero then it spans the sign representation .",
    "now suppose @xmath476 is nonzero and let @xmath477 be an element of the centraliser @xmath325 .",
    "then we see that @xmath478 this implies that @xmath477 is even , since @xmath476 spans the sign representation .",
    "therefore if the sign representation occurs in @xmath337 then @xmath325 contains only even permutations .",
    "the converse is true as well .",
    "if all elements in @xmath479 are even , then the coefficient of @xmath326 in @xmath476 comes out to be @xmath480 , implying that @xmath476 is nonzero , and the sign representation occurs in @xmath481 .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath325 contains only even permutations , precisely if @xmath323 is a permutation of @xmath1 into distinct odd parts .    clearly , if @xmath323 has an even part then there is a cycle of even length in @xmath326 , which gives an element of the centralizer that has odd parity .",
    "also if @xmath323 has two parts of size @xmath482 ( we may assume @xmath482 odd , by above ) , then there is an element of the centralizer which exchanges the corresponding two @xmath482-cycles of @xmath326 , which is a product of @xmath482 many @xmath191-cycles .",
    "so again there is an element of odd parity in @xmath325 .",
    "this shows that for the sign representation to occur inside @xmath337 , we must have that @xmath323 is a partition of @xmath1 into distinct , odd parts .",
    "conversely , if @xmath323 is a partition of @xmath1 into distinct odd parts , then the centraliser is generated by the individual cycles in @xmath326 , and these are all even permutations .",
    "we note that since , as in the proof of the previous proposition , one can always give a precise vector spanning a copy of the sign representation , one can in principle use the methods from above to also find its eigenvalue under @xmath21 .    as a very special case ,",
    "note that proposition  [ p : signrep ] implies in particular that if @xmath1 is even , then the sign representation does not occur in the class of @xmath1-cycles .",
    "this means that , as already remarked , the naive guess at a bijection of conjugacy classes with specht modules contained within them ( given by transposing the diagram ) does not work in general .",
    "nevertheless , for the cases we have looked there _ is _ at least one alternative assignment .",
    "thus for @xmath0 with @xmath343 it is quite possible that one should be able to find each irrep in a distinct conjugacy class , but clearly some further ideas are needed .",
    "in order to provide empirical supporting evidence for our conjectures as well as get a grip on the behaviour of the killing forms associated to minimal calculi for finite simple groups we have performed an extensive amount of computational verifications .",
    "most of our calculations have been performed using the open source computer algebra system sage in a linux workstation , relying heavily on gap for some internal procedures .",
    "the code of the actual implementation is available from the authors upon request .          1 .",
    "pick a generator @xmath233 of @xmath15 , 2 .",
    "compute a section @xmath485 , such that @xmath486 for all @xmath487 , 3 .",
    "compute the function @xmath488 and cache its values , 4 .",
    "compute @xmath489 as @xmath490 .    in practical terms",
    ", the suggested method reduces the computation of the killing form to the computation of the first row and the permutations that create all the other rows from the first one .",
    "the resulting algorithm provides a reasonably quick computation of the killing form , allowing to compute them for all conjugacy classes of all finite simple groups of order up to 75000 .",
    "the limiting factors of the implementation are related to exhaustion of the computer memory rather than computing times , with the first conjugacy class out of our reach being the class 6b of elements of order 6 with centralizer of size 6 in the next larger group , the mathieu group @xmath491 of order 95040 .",
    "the naming of the conjugacy classes is according to the convention in the atlas @xcite .",
    "nondegeneracy of @xmath21 is checked by using sage internal algorithms for computing the rank of @xmath21 .",
    "computationally , finding the rank is quick enough and does nt require substantially more resources than computing the matrix itself . up to order 75,000 the killing form is nondegenerate in all cases but the following exceptions :    * the ( mutually inverse ) conjugacy classes 7a and 7b of elements of order 7 in the alternating group @xmath492 , * the ( pairwise inverse ) conjugacy classes 4a , 4b , 8a , 8b , 12a , 12b of elements of orders 4 , 8 or 12 in the unitary group @xmath493 . * the two ( mutually inverse ) conjugacy classes 7a and 7b of elements of order 7 in @xmath494 .    as mentioned before , all the degenerate cases occur in conjugacy classes that are not closed under inversion , so reality of the conjugacy class appears to be a sufficient condition ( though by no means necessary ) for the nondegeneracy of @xmath21 .",
    "the irreducibility of @xmath21 is tested by using standard algorithms for checking connectedness of the graph @xmath495 with vertices indexed by elements of @xmath15 and containing an edge @xmath496 if and only if @xmath497 . the size of the graph @xmath495 is substantially smaller than the size of @xmath21 and the connectedness checking is also fast , so again this test does not produce much of an additional overhead .    generically , the tested killing forms yield irreducible matrices , so that perron - frobenius theorem applies and the eigenspace associated to the maximal eigenvalue is 1-dimensional ; the only observed exceptions to irreducibility are given by the conjugacy classes of involutions in the linear groups @xmath498 , @xmath499 , @xmath500 , @xmath501 , the exceptional suzuki group @xmath502 and the unitary group @xmath181 .",
    "the observed reducible cases suggest a particular behaviour for the classes of involutions only when the group naturally appears as a group of matrices with coefficients on a field of characteristic 2",
    ". however , not every such group and class of involutions is reducible , as shown by the data for @xmath494 .",
    "for this problem we find some additional limiting factors .",
    "the computation of the characteristic polynomial and the determination of the eigenvalues gets slow and as the size of the conjugacy classes increase .",
    "the eigenvalues with their corresponding multiplicity have been computed for all the listed groups .",
    "that computation has revealed that the killing form appears to be positive definite whenever it comes from a conjugacy class consisting of involutions , plus the mutually inverse classes 3a and 3b of elements of order 3 and centralizer of size 648 in the unitary group @xmath257 .",
    "thus to the level visible in the data and for real conjugacy classes the classes of involutions are precisely those where the killing form is positive definite .",
    "moreover , we see also that for real conjugacy classes those which are not classes of involutions have precisely an equal number of positive and negative eigenvalues taken with multiplicity , i.e. zero signature .    for the same groups , we have also computed the decomposition into irreps of the adjoint representation on @xmath182 by means of character theory , looking for some correlation between both decompositions . as the group get larger , the observed behaviour is that the dimensions of the eigenspaces coincide with the dimensions of irreducible representations , so as the group size increases we expect that each eigenspace contains exactly one irrep .",
    "the obvious exceptions to this rule are the conjugacy classes yielding reducible killing forms mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "we have tried to make the correlation between irreps and eigenspaces more precise , and implemented an algorithm that finds the irrep decomposition of each eigenspace . however , the exact determination of the eigenspaces turns out to be too slow and memory intensive to be of any practical use except for the few smallest conjugacy classes .",
    "we hope we will be able to get around this issue in the near future .      here",
    "we summarize some of the obtained data for all finite simple groups up to order 75,000 .",
    "we list whether the conjugacy class is real ( closed for inverses ) , whether the corresponding killing form irreducible , and its signature .",
    "the naming of the conjugacy classes follows the convention at the atlas , and conjugacy classes of elements order with the same centralizer sizes have been amalgamated whenever they show identical behaviour .",
    "listing the actual eigenspace decomposition of the adjoint representation on @xmath182 would be too lengthy and not particularly enlightening , so we shall omit that data here .",
    "whenever the killing form is reducible we have included between brackets the number of irreducible components in the corresponding column .",
    "the signature of the killing form is expressed as the triple @xmath503 where @xmath504 , @xmath1 and @xmath505 are respectively the number ( counted with multiplicities ) of positive , negative and zero eigenvalues ; in particular , nondegeneracy is given by zero as the last number of this triple . in supplementary information",
    "we list the maximal eigenvalue @xmath506 of the killing form , equal to the row sum . for a real conjugacy class @xmath507",
