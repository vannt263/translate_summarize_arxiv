    "experiments in neutrino physics @xcite and dark matter searches @xcite often involve very small interaction rates , and therefore desire a good detection sensitivity of low count rates of background .",
    "the elimination of known background signals from the physical signals constitutes a major part of the studies . however , complete reduction of background , especially neutron origin signals , is not possible even for very deep underground laboratories .",
    "therefore , direct measurement of neutron background and its elimination are very crucial for such experiments .    with these as objectives and within the framework of the texono research program @xcite , we develop some methods to construct actual neutron energy spectra and open a new research window to determine the neutron background from the direct measurement of neutron flux at the experimental site where the physical data taking will require low energy and low background environments , in order to determine its contribution to the background and eliminate it from the physical signals .",
    "the `` hybrid neutron detector '' ( hnd ) custom - built for this study consists of bicron bc501a @xcite , also known as ne231 or ej301 , liquid scintillator detector , which is sensitive for fast neutrons and bc702 @xcite organic scintillator detector , which is sensitive to thermal neutrons  @xcite .",
    "liquid and organic scintillator detectors are widely used for neutron detection due to their high detection and capture efficiency .",
    "however , they are also sensitive to gamma rays as well . the @xmath2 discrimination can be performed effectively with these scintillator detectors via pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) technique due to the different behavior of decay time component of the pulse shape .",
    "one of the purposes of this study is to develop a psd technique providing a good and effective discrimination of neutron against gamma background and thereby construct actual neutron energy spectrum from its measured recoil spectra .",
    "fast neutrons can be produced by cosmic - ray interaction with environmental or surrounding materials as a secondary products or by spontaneous fission products via @xmath3 reactions coming from radioactive materials in the rock such as naturally occurring isotopes of @xmath4 and @xmath5 decay chains .",
    "the main physical mechanism of fast neutron detection is that the incident fast neutron scatters from the protons in the scintillating medium until it leaves from the detector with partial energy deposition or is totally captured .",
    "the scintillation signal is produced during the interaction by each recoiling proton .",
    "on the other hand , in case of incident thermal neutron , it diffuses in the detector medium and captured by @xmath6 in a fine zns(ag ) phosphor powder via nuclear reaction of @xmath7 producing scintillations by the resulting alpha particle and triton .",
    "the reason of using @xmath6 as the dopant is that it has the advantage of high neutron capture probability and produces two energetic charged particles that create scintillation .",
