    "( 5cm,6.3cm)(0cm,5.6cm)[r ] the radioactive beam experiment ( rex ) @xcite at isolde , cern is a pilot experiment to demonstrate a novel technique to bunch , charge breed and accelerate radioactive ions provided by the isolde facility .",
    "the experiment was commissioned in 2002 and first physics experiments using the accelerated exotic nuclei with a maximum beam energy of 2.2 mev / u were performed in 2003 . for further details on rex and its future see @xcite .",
    "a picture of the setup in early 2002 is shown on the right with the miniball array on the 65@xmath1 beamline in the foreground . by the end of 2003",
    "rex became a dedicated cern user facility .",
    "the main experimental device currently used with rex is the miniball hp - ge array @xcite .",
    "the array consists of 24 6-fold segmented , individually encapsulated , hp - ge detectors arranged in 8 triple cryostats .",
    "the detectors are mounted on an adjustable frame which allows for an easy adaptation of the geometry to the specific experimental requirements .",
    "the central core and six segment electrodes of each detector are equipped with a preamplifier with a cold stage and a warm main board .",
    "the charge integrated signals are subsequently digitized ( 12 bit , 40 mhz ) and analyzed online and onboard the dgf-4c camac card from xia @xcite . besides energy and timing information the ( user ) algorithms implemented on the card @xcite determine the interaction point of each @xmath0 ray in the detector via pulse shape analysis ( psa ) , resulting in an about 100-fold increase in granularity in comparison to a non - segmented detector ( the position resolution is about 7 - 8 mm fwhm , depending on the energy of the @xmath0 ray ) .",
    "all digitizers run independently ( receiving the same clock signal ) and each single event is time stamped by a 40 mhz clock for offline event reconstruction .",
    "in addition to the miniball array an annular charged particle detector telescope ( of cd type , see @xcite ) is employed consisting of a @xmath2 m thick @xmath3 followed by a @xmath2 m thick @xmath4 detector .",
    "the @xmath3 detector is highly segmented ( 24x4 annular and 16x4 radial strips ) to allow for a kinematic reconstruction of the events and covers an angular range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "a parallel plate avalanche counter @xcite was used to monitor the beam at zero degrees without stopping it , so that the ( radioactive ) beam particles are not deposited in the target area and reach the beam dump to reduce the radioactive decay background .",
    "the primary aim of rex and miniball is the investigation of the development of the structure of nuclei far from stability .",
    "the reactions of choice to study the single particle and collective properties of nuclei with low - energy re - accelerated isol beams ( @xmath7 coulomb barrier ) are single - nucleon transfer reactions and coulomb excitation , respectively .",
    "especially favorable for neutron - rich nuclei are ( d , p ) reactions ( in inverse kinematics ) on deuterated polyethylene targets , since here the cross sections are relatively high @xcite and the neutron - pickup product is more neutron - rich by one neutron . by determining the differential cross sections to certain states as well as",
    "the angular distribution of the deexcitation @xmath0 rays their spins and parities can be determined . from the absolute cross section , spectroscopic factors can be extracted .",
    "an interesting region in the chart of nuclides is around the @xmath8 nucleus @xmath9 mg .",
    "this region is well known as the island of deformation for almost 30 years @xcite , yet still , the knowledge on the nuclei in this region is very limited . even today",
    "the extent of intruder ground state configurations in this region of the nuclear chart is not known .",
    "@xmath10 values for the even - even nuclei up to @xmath11 ( @xmath12 mg ) have been measured @xcite rather recently , mainly by intermediate - energy coulomb excitation at projectile fragmentation facilities .",
    "however , the data are very imprecise and measurements of different laboratories disagree by as much as a factor of two indicating that the systematic errors are not completely understood .",
    "the main contribution to the systematic error in these experiments is probably due to coulomb ",
    "nuclear interference effects , which are always present at such high beam energies , even if the scattering angle of the projectiles is restricted to small values .",
    "in contrast , the coulomb excitation studies planned at rex - isolde will be performed with beam energies well below the coulomb barrier , yielding truly model independent results . in fig .",
    "[ fig : be2 ] the theoretical and experimentally determined @xmath13 for the neutron - rich mg isotopes as a function of neutron number @xmath14 are shown .",
    "it should be noted that all the theoretical results @xcite are rather recent but give ( nevertheless ) very different values .",
    "based on the data shown , a discrimination between the theoretical models is not possible .    most information on the odd and odd - a nuclei stems from @xmath15 decay experiments ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and in the future it will be attempted to measure ground state nuclear moments by the @xmath15 nmr technique after polarization with a laser @xcite .",
    "illustration of the @xmath16 interaction between neutron and proton orbitals with the same orbital angular momentum @xmath17 and different total angular momentum @xmath18 .",
    "this interaction was found to be very attractive for stable nuclei and rather weak for exotic neutron - rich nuclei , where the corresponding proton orbitals are often not filled , contributing to the appearance of new magic numbers @xcite .",
    ", width=340 ]    in a recent publication otsuka _",
    "@xcite pointed out the importance of the @xmath16 ( residual ) interaction between orbits of the same orbital angular momentum , but with different total angular momentum between neutron and proton orbitals ( see illustration in fig . [",
    "fig : ots_sigma_tau ] for the sd - shell ) .",
    "it is due to this interaction that the effective single particle energy ( espe ) of the @xmath19d@xmath20 orbital is much lower in energy for stable nuclei , where the @xmath21d@xmath22 orbital is nearly filled ( resulting in a strong attraction of the orbitals ) in comparison to very neutron - rich nuclei , where the @xmath21d@xmath22 is nearly empty .",
    "@xmath23o ( @xmath21d@xmath22 completely empty ) , e.g. , shows features of a double magic nucleus due to the rise of the espe of the @xmath19d@xmath20 orbital@xcite . to further test the role of @xmath16 in the structure of these neutron - rich nuclei more precise",
    "experimental data are urgently needed .    at rex - isolde with miniball there is the possibility to study nuclei far from stability with standard nuclear physics tools ( in inverse kinematics ) , which are not only well proven , but which also allow a direct comparison of the experimental results to ones obtained with stable beams . therefore a program was started to systematically study the neutron - rich nuclei in this region via neutron - pickup reactions and coulomb excitation .",
    "preliminary @xmath0 energy spectra are shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : na26_spec ] and [ fig : mg31_spec ] to demonstrate the quality of the spectra measured with a radioactive beam .    the spectrum in fig .  [ fig : na26_spec ] was taken in about 7 hours with a @xmath24na beam ( 2 neutrons away from stability ) with a beam energy of 2.2 mev / u and an intensity of about @xmath25 on a deuterated polyethylene target with a thickness of @xmath26 .",
    "the transitions with energies of 151 and 234 kev depopulating the state at 234 kev were already known . in this low - energy part of the @xmath0 spectrum",
    "two more lines can be identified and assigned to @xmath27na : 324 and 406 kev .",
    "the energy difference of the two transitions ( 82 kev ) corresponds exactly to the energy difference of the two known transitions , suggesting that they depopulate the same state to the ground state ( 406  kev line ) and to the first excited state at 82 kev ( 324  kev line ) .",
    "furthermore a level with an energy of @xmath28  kev was previously known and the two transitions can therefore be assigned as shown in the inset in the figure .",
    "the two lines around 80  kev are due to other reaction channels . the line at 78.1  kev results from a fusion - evaporation reaction of the projectile with the @xmath29c nuclei also present in the polyethylene target , leading to the population of the first excited state in @xmath9p via the @xmath29c(@xmath24na,@xmath30n)@xmath9p reaction .",
    "indeed this transition leads to the only line visible , when gating on energies above 10  mev in the cd @xmath3 detector , since only particles with a @xmath31 larger than one can deposit more energy .",
    "the transitions with energies of 89.5 kev are due to inelastic scattering of the @xmath24na beam nuclei on the deuterons in the target ( d(@xmath24na,@xmath24na@xmath32)d ) .",
    "[ fig : mg31_spec ] shows a spectrum taken in about 66 hours with a @xmath33 mg beam ( 4 neutrons away from stability with a halflife of only 335 ms ) with an intensity of about @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) on the same target ( @xmath36 m deuterated polyethylene ) .",
    "several known transitions in @xmath37 mg can be seen , namely at 50.5 kev , 171 kev , and 222 kev .",
    "in addition a strong line at 54.6 kev is evident .",
    "this transition is coincident with tritons in the particle detector and corresponds therefore to the transition of the first excited state in @xmath38 mg ( populated via the d(@xmath33mg,@xmath38mg)t reaction ) to the ground state .",
    "the inset shows a spectrum gated on the 171 kev line . as expected",
    "only the 50.5 kev transitions can be seen in this spectrum .",
    "the statistics is still rather good demonstrating the high efficiency of the miniball array .",
    "please note the very low background seen in these spectra , even though the beam particles are radioactive , and the extremely low - energy threshold of only 40 - 50  kev , which should be compared to a threshold of typically several 100 kev in experiments with fast beams .    a preliminary spectrum from the coulomb excitation of @xmath33 mg on a ni target with a beam energy of 2.25  mev / u is shown in fig .  [ fig : mg30_spec ] .",
    "the energies of the detected @xmath0 rays were doppler corrected using the position information on the @xmath0 rays from the miniball array and the position information on the @xmath33 mg particles detected in the cd detector ; only preliminary values for the geometry were available when this spectrum was generated resulting in a resolution of only about 20 kev fwhm .",
    "only events with @xmath33 mg nuclei detected in the cd detector were included in the analysis ; events where the recoiling ni nuclei were registered still have to be analyzed , increasing the shown statistics by a factor of about two . simultaneously to the excitation of the beam particles also the target nuclei are coulomb excited .",
    "when the proper doppler correction for the recoiling target nuclei is performed transitions due to coulomb excitations of @xmath39ni with energies of 1454  kev and 1332  kev , respectively , show up as sharp peaks in the spectrum .",
    "the lifetimes of the first excited @xmath40 states of @xmath39ni are very well known and can therefore serve as a calibration for the extraction of the @xmath41 of @xmath33 mg .",
    "after the final analysis the statistical uncertainty on the extracted @xmath10 should be on the order of 7 - 9% which is comparable to the total error of the msu result @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainties will be much smaller , though .    in conclusion , rex and miniball",
    "are fully operational and first physics experiments focusing on the nuclear structure of the neutron - rich na and mg isotopes were performed .",
    "a preliminary analysis shows the high quality of the data that can be obtained with miniball at rex - isolde with a radioactive , low - energy and low - intensity beam .",
    "the data are currently under analysis .",
