    "the saturation value of @xmath159 at low @xmath11 is then given by the condition @xmath161 , i.e. , @xmath162    the universal power - law behavior in temperature shows the characteristics of a second - order phase transition . and the magnetization @xmath63 is used as a continuous parameter for the phase transition between adjacent qah phases .",
