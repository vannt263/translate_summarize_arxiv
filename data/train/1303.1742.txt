    "the ability to determine black hole masses is a crucial step toward understanding the link between galaxies and their black holes , as well as the details of the black hole environment . to date ,",
    "dynamical methods have resulted in measurements of some 50 black hole masses . however , these methods require that the gravitational influence of the black hole on the stars or gas be spatially resolved , effectively limiting the reach of current dynamical methods to galaxies no further than @xmath5mpc for even the most massive black holes ( see @xcite )",
    ".    active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , in contrast , are some of the most luminous objects in the universe , and are thus capable of providing us with the leverage needed to probe the growth and evolution of black holes at any significant cosmological distance .",
    "however , agns are also so rare that even the nearest are generally too distant for current instruments to spatially resolve the radius of influence of the black hole and provide a local calibration for their masses . instead , the most successful technique for measuring black hole masses in agns is reverberation mapping @xcite .",
    "reverberation mapping requires high - quality spectrophotometric monitoring of an agn over an extended period of time .",
    "the line - emitting regions that give rise to the characteristic agn spectral signatures are photoionized by the hot accretion disk around the black hole .",
    "the continuum flux ( which arises from the accretion disk or very close to it ) varies with time , and these variations are echoed later by changes in the flux of the broad emission lines .",
    "the delay time between the continuum variations and the broad - line variations can be measured by cross correlation of the light curves and gives the light - travel time across the broad - line region ( blr ) , or the radius of the blr when multiplied by the speed of light . in effect , reverberation mapping substitutes high temporal resolution for high spatial resolution , allowing us to probe regions of gas that are only @xmath6pc in extent ( comparable to the inner region of the oort cloud in our own solar system ; @xcite ) in the centers of arbitrarily distant galaxies .",
    "combining the blr radius with the mean velocity of the blr gas , as measured from the doppler broadening of the emission lines , and assumptions or indirect estimates of the virial coefficient gives a direct constraint on the black hole mass via the virial theorem .",
    "the validity of reverberation masses has been upheld by several independent lines of evidence .",
    "a subset of objects in the reverberation sample have measurements for several different emission lines throughout the ultraviolet and optical portions of their spectra , and the multiple emission lines show a virial behavior ( e.g. , @xcite ) . two agns in the current reverberation sample  ngc3227 and ngc4151  are sufficiently close that dynamical modeling has successfully determined their black hole masses , and both the stellar dynamical masses @xcite and gas dynamical masses @xcite agree with the reverberation - based masses within the uncertainties . furthermore , a fully general bayesian modeling code has recently been developed to analyze reverberation - mapping datasets and place limits on the black hole mass and the blr geometry and dynamics @xcite . when applied to the reverberation mapping data for arp151 @xcite and mrk50 @xcite , the method recovers a black hole mass that is essentially the same value as that determined from the reverberation method outlined above , for standard assumptions of the virial coefficient @xcite .",
    "reverberation mapping has yielded black hole masses for @xmath7 agns thus far @xcite . the blr radius ",
    "luminosity correlation ( @xmath8 ) derived from this reverberation sample is the basis for _ all _ secondary techniques used to estimate black hole masses in distant agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the power of the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship comes from the simplicity of using it to quickly estimate @xmath9  for large samples of objects , even at high redshift , with only a single spectrum per object .",
    "this simplicity has led to the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship being heavily utilized in the literature . a small sampling of studies that have utilized the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship in the last few years includes investigations of @xmath9  in the most distant quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , black hole mass functions and eddington ratio distributions through cosmic history ( e.g. , @xcite ) , cosmic evolution of black holes and their host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the nature of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , duty cycles of quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , accretion properties of various types of agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , studies of relativistic jets and the jet - disk connection ( e.g. , @xcite ) , studies of black holes in dwarf and low - mass galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and studies of optical transients ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because of the utility of the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship , much work has gone into removing biases and noise from the reverberation database .",
    "previous determinations of the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship used luminosity measurements from ground - based spectra and found the slope to be @xmath10 @xcite . to achieve the low level of uncertainties in the flux calibration necessary for reverberation mapping , a large ( e.g. , 5  @xmath11  7 ) spectroscopic aperture is typically employed .",
    "therefore , for all the nearby objects with reverberation masses , a substantial fraction of the observed luminosity is actually the result of the host - galaxy starlight and not the agn itself .",
    "the entire low - luminosity end of the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship was overestimated in @xmath2 , in effect , artificially steepening the slope .",
    "@xcite analyzed _ hst _  acs images of the nearest reverberation - mapped agns and their host galaxies taken through the f550 m medium - band @xmath12 filter .",
    "the flux contribution of starlight through the ground - based spectroscopic monitoring aperture was measured from each image , and the reverberation - mapping luminosities were corrected accordingly .",
    "the resultant @xmath1@xmath2  relationship was found , as expected , to have a much flatter slope ( @xmath13 compared to @xmath14 ) , consistent with simple photoionization expectations .",
    "consequently , all of the remaining objects in the reverberation - mapped sample were imaged with acs in a similar manner with the intent of properly accounting for the starlight in each object , even when that contribution was assumed to be small .",
    "while the slope of the relationship did not change much ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) , the scatter in the relationship was reduced from @xmath16% to @xmath17% .",
    "the scarcity of measurements anchoring the low - luminosity end , in particular , then became apparent .",
    "in the meantime , much effort has gone into replacing noisy and poorly sampled reverberation datasets and increasing the overall range of blr radii probed .",
    "the last several years in particular have seen a huge amount of effort invested in reverberation - mapping experiments that preferentially target agns with relatively low luminosities .",
    "the lick agn monitoring project ( lamp ) campaign targeted low - luminosity agns to more fully populate the low - luminosity end of the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship and succeeded in measuring h@xmath0 blr radii for 8 new agns @xcite .",
    "multiple recent campaigns at mdm observatory have mainly focused on replacing poorly sampled or noisy reverberation datasets with high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , high temporal cadence spectroscopy ( @xcite ) to allow better constraints on the blr structure and kinematics .",
    "given the number of updates , improvements , and additions to the reverberation database , we undertook a full recalibration of the @xmath1@xmath2relationship in an effort to provide a more accurately calibrated relationship for the community to use when estimating black hole masses in agns .",
    "in particular , our new calibration is more accurate at the low - luminosity end where @xmath18 and sub-@xmath18 galaxies tend to reside .",
    "we assume a standard @xmath19cdm cosmology of @xmath20kms@xmath21mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 throughout this work .",
    "recent reverberation - mapping campaigns have focused mainly on the low - luminosity end of the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship and provide several new h@xmath0 blr measurements to the reverberation sample .",
    "the measurements come in three separate flavors : ( 1 ) replacement measurements for targets of previous reverberation campaigns for which the light curves were noisy or undersampled and led to poor or biased determinations of the h@xmath0 blr radius , ( 2 ) additional measurements for targets of previous reverberation campaigns that already have accurate h@xmath0 time - lag measurements , and ( 3 ) h@xmath0 blr measurements for new objects that have not been previously examined with reverberation mapping .",
    "we provide a brief summary of each of the monitoring programs with the new results that we incorporate here .",
    "the interested reader should refer to the original manuscripts reporting the h@xmath0 blr measurements for more details .",

    "mrk290 was also included in the 2008 lamp sample of agns ( see below ) but did not exhibit strong variations during that campaign .",
    "the inclusion of mrk290 in the lamp sample led to it being included in the _ hst _  cycle 17 imaging campaign that we describe below , from which we are able to derive the starlight correction to the luminosity .",

    "measurements of the h@xmath0 blr radius were determined for eight new objects , and an additional measurement of the h@xmath0 blr radius in the well - studied agn ngc5548 was also determined @xcite .",
    "ngc5548 was the only galaxy in the lamp sample with the appropriate _ hst _  imaging to allow a host - galaxy starlight correction . in the next sections we detail the _ hst _  cycle 17 imaging program through which we obtained the necessary images for the remainder of the lamp sample , the host - galaxy surface brightness modeling of those images , and the derived starlight corrections to the ground - based spectroscopic monochromatic luminosities at 5100 .",

    "two other agns , mrk6 and mrk1501 , were new targets and reliable h@xmath0 radii were determined for them .",
    "unfortunately , there is no suitable _ hst_imaging from which to measure the starlight correction to the spectroscopic luminosity .",
    "we are therefore unable to include them in this analysis of the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship .",
    "the addition of nine new agns to the reverberation sample along with 11 replacement or additional datasets for previously monitored agns allows us to revisit the calibration of the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship , and in particular to examine the form of the relationship at the lower luminosity end .",

    "images are available for some of the objects not included here , but these images are not suitable for our analysis for one of three reasons : ( 1 ) they were taken with a different filter and therefore include emission lines from the galaxy and/or the narrow - line region , both of which would have to be corrected , and they would require assumptions about the unknown underlying stellar populations in the galaxy , and/or ( 2 ) the exposures are too shallow to accurately constrain the host - galaxy surface brightness profiles , or ( 3 ) the images are heavily saturated in the nucleus , with strong bleeding and a loss of information at the galaxy center .",
    "we do not include reverberation measurements of other balmer lines in this analysis because previous work ( @xcite ) has shown that there are differences in the mean time lags determined for different balmer lines , most likely caused by radiative - transfer effects in the blr clouds .",
    "we are left with the sample of 41 agns that are listed in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "nine agns with new h@xmath0 time lags were imaged during cycle 17 ( go-11662 , pi bentz ) with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) uvis channel through the f547 m ( strmgren @xmath27 ) filter ( @xmath28  and @xmath29 ) .",
    "this imaging setup allowed us to probe the continuum flux from the agn and the host galaxy while avoiding strong emission lines .",
    "one orbit was dedicated to each object , and each orbit was divided into two sets of exposures separated by a dithering maneuver to improve the sampling of the wfc3 point - spread function ( psf ) and facilitate in the rejection of cosmic rays and detector artifacts ( such as transient warm pixels ) . to maximize the dynamic range of the final images , each set of three exposures",
    "was graduated in time , with exposure times of approximately 30s , 300s , and 690s .",
    "we did not dither during an exposure sequence to ensure that all three images were taken at the same position .",
    "most of our targets were compact enough to fit on a single chip of the uvis channel , but for ngc6814 we employed a larger dithering maneuver to ensure that there was no loss of information because of the gap between the chips .",
    "details of the _ hst _",
    "observations are given in table  [ tab : hstobs ] .",
    "we were able to correct for saturation in the long exposures by making use of the linear nature of charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) .",
    "saturated pixels in the nucleus of each galaxy were identified in each image by consulting the data quality frames from the _ hst _  pipeline .",
    "these saturated pixels were clipped from the image and replaced by the same pixels from a shallower , unsaturated exposure , but scaled up by the exposure - time ratio .",
    "cosmic rays were cleaned with the laplacian cosmic ray identification package l.a.cosmic @xcite .",
    "all of the frames for a single object were then combined with the _ multidrizzle _ task to create a distortion - free image of each agn host galaxy .",
    "the final combined , drizzled images are shown in figure  [ fig : apertures ] with the ground - based spectroscopic monitoring apertures overlaid . it can easily be seen that the host galaxy of each agn contributes a significant amount of light within the monitoring aperture .",
    "an important component of calibrating the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship is properly correcting the @xmath2 measurements for the contribution from host - galaxy starlight .",
    "the method we employed here is similar to that described by @xcite , where the analysis of 32 galaxies in our sample is reported ; it relies on using the software program galfit  @xcite to model the surface brightness profiles of the host - galaxy images .",
    "galfit  is a nonlinear least - squares two - dimensional image - fitting algorithm .",
    "we used the latest version of galfit  ( version 3 ) which allows for the modeling of spiral arms , rings , and irregular shapes ( see @xcite for a full description and various examples ) .    for the surface brightness decomposition of each of the 9 new _ hst_host - galaxy images in this work , we employed a tilted plane for the background sky flux and a tinytim @xcite model for the unresolved agn .",
    "tinytim models were generated for each specific agn by creating a model at the specific detector position of each of the pointings and combining these models through _ multidrizzle _ in the same way that the agn images were combined .",
    "host - galaxy bulges , disks , and bars were all fit with @xcite profiles of the basic form @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the pixel surface brightness at the effective radius @xmath32 .",
    "the srsic  index , @xmath33 , has a value of 1 for an exponential disk , 4 for a @xcite profile , and 0.5 for a gaussian .",
    "bulge and bar components were modeled by allowing the srsic  index to vary with no constraints while disks were modeled by holding the srsic  index fixed at a value of 1 .",
    "fits that resulted in bulge srsic  indices outside of the range @xmath346 were considered unphysical and therefore unacceptable . in these cases , we required multiple psf models in the center of the galaxy , offset by fractions of a pixel , to keep the srsic  index of the bulge from running up the maximum value allowed by galfit , @xmath35 .",
    "a high srsic  index has a very peaky shape with strong wings , and can mimic a psf+sky model .",
    "a runaway srsic  index in our galaxy fitting is likely because of the well - known psf mismatch that can occur between tinytim models and wfc3 images due to spacecraft `` breathing '' and/or jitter , but could potentially be caused by any marginally resolved nuclear flux from hot gas or star clusters .",
    "we assume here that the cause is psf mismatch and ascribe all of the flux in these multiple psf models ( which we assume are modeling a single physical component ) to the agn itself , and we describe various tests of the validity of this assumption below .",
    "galfit  allows for surface brightness decompositions that can be as simple or complicated as the user may wish .",
    "the ultimate goal of the surface brightness modeling in this project was to accurately remove the agn psf , thereby creating an `` agn - free '' image of each host galaxy from which the starlight contribution could be measured .",
    "@xcite assume uncertainties of 0.1mag in the measured host - galaxy flux based in the range of acceptable models that could be found to fit an image .",
    "here , we investigate the uncertainty in the best - fit models by carrying out two independent sets of surface brightness decompositions for each of the host - galaxy images in this study .",
    "the first set of models , which we will refer to as the `` optimal '' models , include multiple surface brightness components and make use of power - law rotation to model spiral arms , fourier modes to account for `` bending '' of the ellipse modeling the light distribution and other asymmetric flux distributions , and truncation functions to allow for the modeling of rings .",
    "these models , which are shown in the bottom panels of figures  [ fig : m142]@xmath36[fig : n6814 ] , are the best representations for the actual two - dimensional surface brightness distributions of the host galaxies .    the second set of models , which we refer to as `` simple '' models , do not make use of power - law rotations , fourier modes , or truncation functions .",
    "the simple models typically require a factor of 3 fewer free parameters than the optimal models and they are computationally much faster to run and to converge , but they less accurately represent the two - dimensional surface brightness profiles of the agn host galaxies , as can be seen in the top panels of figures  [ fig : m142]@xmath36[fig : n6814 ] .",
    "conversely , the optimal models do a good job of reproducing the relative flux in each pixel in the images , but the importance of this , other than being aesthetically pleasing , is not clear and the physical interpretation of each model component is not straightforward to determine .",
    "tables  [ tab : m142]@xmath36[tab : n6814 ] give the parameters determined for the `` optimal '' and `` simple '' fits for each of the 9 galaxies fit here . the formats of the tables are as follows : column ( 1 ) gives the note for the type of fit described ( `` optimal '' or `` simple '' ) ; column ( 2 ) gives the component number of the fit , generally in order of increasing angular size and increasing angular offset from the center of the galaxy ; and column ( 3 ) gives the description for the type of model component ( or components in the case of a psf model and tilted plane sky model ) .",

    "this particular prediction of photoionization physics , namely that the size of the blr should scale with the luminosity of the central source , was sought in the very early days of reverberation - mapping experiments , when the first blr sizes were being measured @xcite .",
    "it took another decade , however , for the blr measurements to span a sufficiently large dynamic range so that the relationship was clearly detected , despite the large initial scatter @xcite",
    ".    more recent work on the physical basis for an @xmath1@xmath2  relationship , spurred on by the initial and continuing successes of the reverberation - mapping method including near - infrared ( ir ) photometric reverberation mapping @xcite , has focused on the role of dust and the dust sublimation radius in setting the size of the blr .",
    "the importance of dust was first noted by @xcite and has been analyzed more recently by @xcite , among others .",
    "the upshot of many of these models is that the outer edge of the blr is bounded by the dust sublimation radius , perhaps coincident with the inner edge of the dusty torus - like structure of the unified model @xcite . outside the dust sublimation radius",
    ", the line emission from the dusty gas is suppressed by a large factor because the dust grains absorb many of the incoming ionizing photons as well as the emitted line photons , effectively creating an outer edge for the blr .",
    "a natural consequence of a central ionizing source with a variable flux is that the dust sublimation radius will respond to these flux variations .",
    "an increase in ionizing photons will destroy many dust grains and increase the dust sublimation radius , whereas a decrease in ionizing flux will allow more grains to condense or migrate in and decrease the dust sublimation radius . while the basic physical motivation for a @xmath1@xmath2  relationship seems to be understood ,",
    "there are many details that are currently unknown .",
    "@xcite provide a comprehensive overview of the state of photoionization models and the agreement ( or lack , thereof ) with observations .",
    "the form of the relationship appears to be fairly well - determined at this point and has not changed significantly with the updates and additions included here .",
    "the regression results are also consistent with the results of a microlensing analysis of the blr in lensed quasars , where the magnification amplitude is dependent on the size of the emission region , an independent method that is not subject to the same uncertainties involved in reverberation mapping @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the scatter about the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship is now quite low .",
    "the linmix_err routine provides an estimate of the scatter about the relationship of @xmath115dex ( about 56% ) .",
    "we plot the residuals of the measured blr radii to the estimated blr radii derived from the results of the linmix_err routine fit in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : rl ] .",
    "the residuals are approximately normally distributed , as can be seen by comparison to an overplotted gaussian function with @xmath116dex ( dotted line ) .",
    "the scatter about the relationship is often called the `` intrinsic '' scatter , but in this case it is actually a combination of the real intrinsic scatter and variance from inaccurate or biased measurements .",
    "thus , the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship is likely to be less than the @xmath115dex we find here . indeed ,",
    "if we omit the two most suspicious measurements in the sample , those of mrk142 and pg2130 + 099 as discussed above , we find that the scatter drops to 0.13dex .",
    "the residuals with the exclusion of mrk142 , the adopted lag of @xmath105 days for pg2130 + 099 , and the reddening correction for ngc3227 are plotted in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : rl ] .",
    "this is significantly lower than the typical scatter in black hole scaling relationships , such as the 0.4dex scatter ( or larger ) of the @xmath117  relationship @xcite .",
    "such low scatter in the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship and the potential to decrease it even further with accurate distances and additional reverberation campaigns seems to lend support to the recent arguments of @xcite that the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship could potentially be used to turn any agn with a well - determined h@xmath0 time lag into a standardizable candle for use in cosmological studies . while there is still work to be done before the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship can match the 0.05dex scatter in the type ia supernova hubble diagram residuals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the main weakness at the moment is the lack of accurate distance measurements to tie the current sample of reverberation - mapped agns onto the well - established nearby distance ladder .",
    "however , once this has been rectified , the radius and flux of any agn could be measured and compared to the expected luminosity distance derived from the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship . in principle , this is possible out to @xmath118 for near - ir spectroscopy of the h@xmath0 emission line , far beyond the current reach of type ia supernovae .",
    "the high luminosities of such quasars , however , mean that the observed h@xmath0 time lags would be on the order of decades . because the blr is ionization stratified , emissions lines with a higher ionization potential than h@xmath0 , such as or , have rest - frame time delays that are factors of a few smaller than those of h@xmath0 .",
    "if separate @xmath1@xmath2  relationships for these lines could be defined and calibrated as accurately as we have achieved for h@xmath0 ( see @xcite for current progress on the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship ) , then exploring cosmology with reverberation experiments would become much more feasible for objects with @xmath119 , where the expected observed time delays suffer heavily from time - dilation effects .",
    "the ability to probe out to such high redshifts would provide observational constraints on the evolution of the dark energy equation - of - state parameter , as well as on alternative theories of gravity ( king et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the most pressing deficiency in the h@xmath0 @xmath1@xmath2  relationship is the current lack of accurate distance measurements to the agn host galaxies .",
    "the uncertainty in the distances at present provides the single largest source of uncertainty in the agn luminosity measurements , especially as @xcite have shown that peculiar velocities may still be important ( @xmath120% ) even beyond 50mpc .",
    "we are working to obtain distances based on the tully - fisher method for the intermediate inclination spirals in our sample with new hi spectroscopy and near - infrared imaging .",
    "we will also obtain a cepheid - based distance for ngc6814 ( hst go-12961 , pi bentz ) , and will explore additional distance indicators ( such as the globular cluster luminosity function and the planetary nebula luminosity function ) for the remaining agn host galaxies in the sample .",
    "new reverberation campaigns should be dedicated to studying the two most likely outliers in the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship  pg2130 + 099 and mrk142  to determine whether they are truly outliers .",
    "additionally , the difficulties with the flux calibration of arp151 suggest that it would be a useful exercise to acquire new spectra of all the objects in the sample , taken under stable photometric conditions and with a uniform setup .",
    "there is also much work to be done to determine independent @xmath1@xmath2relationships for and other emission lines for use in estimating black hole masses at higher redshifts , where the h@xmath0 emission line has redshifted out of the observed optical bandpass .",
    "all of the derived @xmath1@xmath2  and black hole mass scaling relationships for all other emission lines in the literature currently rely on the h@xmath0 @xmath1@xmath2  relationship .",
    "it is therefore critical that we build up independent @xmath1@xmath2  relationships for these other commonly utilized emission lines . while and are frequently employed for black hole mass estimates at @xmath121 , there are only a handful of existing reverberation results ( see @xcite ) , with the vast majority centered around a very small range in luminosities , and in the case of , only a single object has a measured reverberation time lag .",
    "furthermore , the time lags are generally deduced from _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ spectra that were obtained every few days , and so have relatively poor temporal sampling compared to what is typically achieved for h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the higher ionization state of means that we expect its time lag to be a factor of 23 shorter than that of h@xmath0 .",
    "future reverberation experiments of low- to moderate - luminosity agns in the nearby universe will require daily sampling or better in order to measure time delays to the same level of significance that is now typically achieved for h@xmath0 .    finally ,",
    "although this empirical relationship is well measured and there seems to be some theoretical understanding behind it , the details of the photoionization physics , as well as the geometry and kinematics of the gas , are not well understood at this time .",
    "there is significant room for improvement in our physical understanding of agn blrs .",
    "we have carried out an imaging program with _ hst _  to provide starlight corrections to the luminosities of 9 agns with h@xmath0 radius measurements .",
    "we have fully updated and revised the calibration sample for the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship , including 20 new h@xmath0 blr measurements from recent reverberation - mapping campaigns , and we have reinvestigated the form of the relationship .",
    "we find a best fit of @xmath122 .",
    "this is consistent with a slope of 0.5 and with previous work that included starlight corrections to the agn luminosity measurements . after including the additions and updates , the single largest source of uncertainty comes from the highly uncertain distances to the agns in the sample .",
    "the low scatter in the relationship ( @xmath123dex ) and the potential to further reduce the scatter , with no clear outliers , support the proposed use of the @xmath1@xmath2  relationship to probe the matter and energy content of the universe out to @xmath124 with optical measurements of the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "pushing the h@xmath0 observations into the near - ir would allow the relationship to probe quasars out to @xmath125 , beyond the reach of type ia supernovae and into a new interesting regime for tests of the predictions of different cosmological models .",
