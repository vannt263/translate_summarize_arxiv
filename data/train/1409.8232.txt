    "efficient evaluation of matrix elements of the coulomb operator ( electron repulsion integrals , eris ) is an essential ingredient of practical quantum chemistry , especially in the context of one - body methods [ hartree  fock ( hf)@xcite and hybrid kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft)@xcite ] and lower - order many - body methods [ second - order mller  plesset ( mp2)@xcite ] . the eri tensor is defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the ( mulliken notation ) bra and ket charge distributions .",
    "the most common version of the eri tensor is the four - center case , in which both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are product densities , composed of either atom - centered basis functions in hf / dft or molecular orbitals in correlated methods such as mp2 . to reduce the computational cost of the four - center eris , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "can be approximately expanded in terms of auxiliary basis set ; the resulting density - fitting ( df ) ( also known as the resolution - of - the - identity , ri ) approximation involves also three- and two - center eris in which either or both of the bra and ket densities are single , atom - centered functions .    when spatially localized basis functions are used , the number of eris with magnitude greater than some threshold @xmath3 is 2 rather than 4 , where @xmath4 is the size of the basis set ( and thus proportional to the size of the molecule ) . to take advantage of this sparsity",
    "it is necessary to estimate the magnitude of eri very rapidly ( i.e. ,  significantly faster than it would take to compute it rigorously ) .",
    "the simplest such estimate invokes the schwarz inequality@xcite @xmath5 which holds because eq .   defines an inner product .",
    "while the schwarz bound substantially reduces the cost of computing the eri tensor by screening out small @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it is not a tight bound because it neglects the decay over distance between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "extensive research has been done recently on integral estimates that incorporate the distance between the bra @xmath6 and the ket @xmath7 distributions.@xcite earlier approaches were based on the multipole expansion of the coulomb kernel,@xcite but these efforts were later abandoned in favor of an empirical modification of the schwarz estimate , referred to as the qqr estimator.@xcite for four - center eris , the qqr estimator can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the well - separatedness ( ws ) extents from the continuous fast multipole method ( cfmm),@xcite and @xmath11 is the distance between centers of charge of bra and ket .",
    "although the qqr estimator is not an upper bound , it is a tight estimate . in practice",
    ", the tightness is more important than the upper bound property anyway because the precision of the computed property ( such as energy ) is a complex function of the truncation threshold for the eris .",
    "whereas some have investigated how to compute , for example , the fock matrix with guaranteed precision in a given gaussian basis,@xcite guaranteeing precision of the energy and other properties is even more difficult due to their nonlinear dependence on the hamiltonian via the density matrix / wave function , among other factors . in practice",
    "the relationship between precision of the target property and the eri truncation threshold is established empirically .",
    "underestimation by the eri estimator will cause some integrals that normally would have been deemed important enough ( above the threshold ) to be skipped .",
    "however , this will only affect the small integrals near the threshold .",
    "furthermore this can be accounted for by adjusting the empirical relationship between precision and truncation threshold .",
    "thus , the lack of the upper - bound property is not an issue in practice .",
    "more discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of rigorous upper bounds versus reliably tight bounds can be found in ref .  .",
    "in the context of the mp2 method it is necessary to replace the `` effective '' distance in the denominator of the qqr estimate with its second or third power to take into account the vanishing leading - order multipoles of bra and ket densities.@xcite the same issue arises when we want to estimate the magnitude of the three - center integrals in the context of the context of reduced - scaling electronic structure methods that utilize ( local ) density fitting approximations.@xcite indeed , eq .   is not a good estimator for the two- and three - electron integrals over atom - centered gaussian basis functions because one or more of the lowest - order multipoles of @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 will vanish for many integrals , and hence long - range decay with @xmath11 will be significantly faster .    to take advantage of the sparsity of the three - center integrals",
    ", we developed a rapid estimator with proper asymptotic @xmath11-dependence .",
    "although our estimator differs technically from the qqr estimator of ochsenfeld and co - workers,@xciteit is similar in spirit .",
    "the primary objective of the estimator is tightness , not a rigorous upper bound .",
    "however , the underestimates in our new bound can be reduced arbitrarily by adjusting the ws parameter .",
    "the estimator is also governed by a second parameter , @xmath12 , which loosely controls the trade - off between tightness of the estimator and the maximum amount of underestimation .",
    "in this work , we will deal with the basis of atom - centered contracted real solid harmonic gaussian - type orbitals ( gtos ) , defined as@xcite @xmath13^{-\\frac12 }    \\label{eq : nfact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are the contraction coefficients , @xmath15 are the associated legendre polynomials , and @xmath16 is the gamma function [ since @xmath17 is a nonnegative integer , @xmath18 .      throughout this work",
    "we will use mulliken ( chemists ) bra - ket notation shown in eq .  .",
    "three - center eri will be written with the principal ( orbital ) basis product @xmath19 in the bra and the one - center auxiliary ( density fitting ) basis function @xmath20 in the ket .",
    "greek letters @xmath21 and @xmath22 will be used to denote functions in the principal basis , and @xmath23 will be used to denote basis functions in the auxiliary basis . for primitives , we will use @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the principal basis and @xmath26 for the auxiliary basis .      consider a three - center eri @xmath28 , where primitive gtos @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 have principal angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and arbitrary @xmath34 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for the @xmath38 quantum numbers ; @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for the primitive exponents ; and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for the centers of the respective primitives ( analogous notation will be used throughout ) . according to the gaussian product theorem ( gpt ) , the bra @xmath45 can be rewritten as a single gaussian centered at the center - of - exponent point @xmath46 located on the line in between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( temporarily neglecting normalization ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath1 is spherically symmetric , from a large enough distance away it can be viewed as a point charge centered at @xmath46 of magnitude @xmath52 ( overlap between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "now consider the potential generated at @xmath46 by a primitive gaussian @xmath31 located at @xmath53 . for practical purposes ,",
    "we wish to determine the average potential of an entire shell ( i.e. , all @xmath37 with @xmath54 ) rather than an individual @xmath37 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality we can orient our system with the @xmath55 axis along the vector @xmath56 . with this orientation ,",
    "a nonzero potential is generated only by the @xmath57 gaussian , and we are left with ( omitting normalization of @xmath58 for now ) @xmath59 we then use the multipole ( laplace ) expansion of the coulomb operator @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the angle between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , to obtain the potential : @xmath66    \\frac{4\\pi}{2\\ell + 1}\\bigg[\\int_0^r\\frac{r^{2\\ell+2}}{r^{\\ell+1}}\\exp(-\\zeta_c r^2)dr      \\\\      + \\int_r^\\infty r^\\ell\\exp(-\\zeta_c r^2)dr\\bigg ] \\end{multlined } \\\\ & = \\begin{multlined}[t ]    \\frac{4\\pi}{2\\ell + 1}\\bigg[\\frac{\\gamma\\!\\left(\\ell_c+\\frac32\\right)-\\gamma\\!\\left(\\ell_c+\\frac32 , r^2\\zeta_c\\right)}{2r^{\\ell+1}\\zeta^{\\ell+\\frac32 } }",

    "rapidly decays to zero for reasonable values of @xmath41 .",
    "since we are interested in behavior at large @xmath11 ( i.e. , where the bra can be viewed as a point charge ) , we can omit this term .",
    "similarly , the incomplete gamma function @xmath67 is bounded from above by @xmath68 for real , positive @xmath69 , and the second part of the first term in eq .",
    "rapidly decays to zero with distance @xmath11 for reasonable values of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath70 inclusion of the normalization factor from eq .",
    "gives @xmath71 to arrive at our long - range estimate for @xmath72 , we simply scale eq .   by the magnitude of the charge term from the bra to get @xmath73 we will refer to this formula as the sv@xmath17estimator .",
    "we derived it by considering the classical limit of the interaction of the electrostatic potential of the @xmath74 ket with the point - charge representation of the @xmath75 ket ; however , since the leading - order multipole of a product of two arbitrary gaussians of any angular momenta is also a charge , at a large - enough distance away this estimate should also be sufficiently accurate .",
    "ideally , we would like to replace the charge - like contribution from the bra in eq .   with a multipole expansion of the bra charge distribution to handle the general case .",
    "unfortunately , it is too expensive to expand the bra distribution to multipoles of high enough order simply for the purpose of estimating integrals .",
    "almost a decade of research on this topic@xcite has led ochsenfeld and co - workers to the conclusion that the best substitute for the multipole expansion in this context is the schwarz bound , @xmath78 ( and hence the qqr estimator in eq .  ) .@xcite in the @xmath75 case , the schwarz estimate can be directly related to the overlap by @xmath79 for higher angular momenta @xmath76 and @xmath77 , though , @xmath80 incorporates contributions from higher - order multipoles , thus improving the estimate ( as discussed in ref .  ) .",
    "incorporating this prefactor , we arrive at the estimator @xmath81 which we call the qv@xmath17estimator .",
    "again , we wish to estimate entire shells for practical purposes , so we have taken shell - wise frobenius norms to obtain a @xmath80 that is rotationally invariant : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the functions with @xmath38 quantum numbers @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the _ shells _ with indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "note that this enforces rotational invariance since the frobenius norm is invariant under rotations .",
    "it can easily be shown that when @xmath85 , the gpt product distribution will always have an @xmath86 contribution .",
    "thus , for large enough @xmath11 , the charge - like term of the bra multipole expansion will dominate , and the integral will eventually decay as @xmath87 , since the denominators of higher - order multipole terms will become much larger than this term .      up to this point",
    ", we have been vague about the definition of `` large @xmath11 , '' stating only that it is a distance from which a bra of the form @xmath75 may be approximated as a point charge to sufficient precision .",
    "to a first approximation , this concept is already well established in the context of cfmm.@xcite in cfmm , two distributions @xmath88 and @xmath89 are considered `` well - separated '' if @xmath90 where the extents @xmath91 and @xmath92 are given by @xmath93 for some given ws threshold @xmath94 . while this formula is obtained for spherical gaussians , this definition turns out to be sufficient for our purposes , given the other approximations involved in our qv@xmath17 estimator . for distributions that are not well separated",
    ", the qv@xmath17 estimator reverts to schwarz screening ( eq .  ) .",
    "thus , the qv@xmath17 estimate can be summarized as @xmath95      as demonstrated in section  [ sec : results ] , the qv@xmath17estimator is robust , yielding estimates within a factor of 10 or so of the exact value for the vast majority of three - center eris .",
    "however , there are several aspects of the formulation that are fundamentally dissatisfying .",
    "while @xmath80 has replaced @xmath52 to better account for the effects of higher order multipoles , the distance scaling factor remains that of the zeroth order multipole ",
    "namely , the overlap .",
    "but the reasoning behind this was that the term with slowest decay should dominate for large enough @xmath11 .",
    "hence @xmath52 should be a better representation of the bra contribution than @xmath80 at large - enough separations .",
    "the problem is that when @xmath24 and @xmath25 are close together but differ significantly in angular momentum , the threshold beyond which higher order multipoles are negligible is much larger than @xmath96 .",
    "the cfmm extents only indicate when it is safe to approximate each term in the multipole expansion of the integral by point multipole interactions , not where it is necessarily safe to truncate the multipole expansion at the leading - order term . when the separation is such that higher order multipoles _ are _ actually small enough compared to the overlap , the sv@xmath17estimator is much better than the qv@xmath17estimator , since it gives the proper prefactor to the proper term . incorporating this concept into the extents for the purposes of thresholding would require the computation of higher order multipole integrals , which we have already noted is too expensive for our purposes .",
    "instead , one can roughly determine the importance of higher order multipoles by taking the ratio @xmath97 .",
    "when this ratio is small , higher - order multipole effects will overcome the additional @xmath11 factors in the denominators of the hypothetical multipole expansion , warning us that the exclusion of the higher - order contributions from @xmath80 could be dangerous .",
    "however , if this ratio is large enough , the dominant contribution to the multipole expansion will be the overlap , and @xmath52 should be used to approximate the bra contribution .",
    "we conclude that the estimator should be controlled by an additional screening parameter , @xmath12 . defining a common prefactor for notational convenience : @xmath98",
    "we can now introduce our best estimator for three - center eris in terms of performance and flexibility , which we will call the sqv@xmath17estimator:@xmath99        r > \\operatorname{ext}_{ab } + \\operatorname{ext}_{c }   \\\\ \\text{and } s_{ab}/q_{ab } > { \\ensuremath{\\vartheta_{\\mathrm{sq}}}\\xspace}\\end{multlined }       \\\\          q_{ab}\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt2\\,\\beta_{\\ell_c}\\!(\\zeta_c)}{(\\zeta_a+\\zeta_b)^{\\frac14}r^{\\ell_c+1 } }      & \\!\\!\\begin{multlined}[c ]        r > \\operatorname{ext}_{ab } + \\operatorname{ext}_{c } \\\\ \\text{and } s_{ab}/q_{ab } \\leq { \\ensuremath{\\vartheta_{\\mathrm{sq}}}\\xspace}\\end{multlined }       \\\\      \\ q_{ab}q_c & \\!\\ ! r \\leq",
    "\\operatorname{ext}_{ab } + \\operatorname{ext}_{c}.    \\end{dcases }    \\label{eq : sqvl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , the sqv@xmath17estimator `` interpolates '' between the sv@xmath17and qv@xmath17estimators : in the limits @xmath100 and @xmath101 the sqv@xmath17estimator becomes equivalent to the sv@xmath17and qv@xmath17estimators , respectively .    as an aside",
    ", we note that for the purposes of our discussion here , three - center eris do not include cases where @xmath102 coincidentally . while these integrals are indeed part of the full three - center eri tensor , they are a small enough part that the discussion of these integrals can be neglected in the current context .",
    "the sqv@xmath17estimator gives an approximate bound for these integrals , but because of the angular momentum addition rules , the actual decay with distance is sometimes much more rapid than the estimate accounts for , leading to significant overestimation . a better estimate for the special two - center case could be developed , but from a practical standpoint it is not worth the effort .",
    "thus far , our discussion has focused only on primitive basis functions . for practical purposes ,",
    "the extension to contracted basis functions is unimportant for many basis sets , since in many cases contracted basis functions are used to represent core orbitals , which do not contribute significantly to long - range integrals .",
    "nevertheless , the extension of the sqv@xmath17estimator to contracted basis functions is relatively trivial , and yet it performs reasonably well even for basis sets composed entirely of contracted functions ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "following ochsenfeld , et al.,@xcite we typically define contracted extents @xmath9 as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the distance from the gpt center of the primitive pair @xmath105 and the coefficient weighted center of charge of the product @xmath106 .",
    "however , in the case of generally contracted basis sets such as the ano - pv@xmath23z series,@xcite this formulation will substantially overestimate most of the extents , and a more careful ( but less safe ) formula is needed .",
    "for these basis sets , we use a coefficient - weighted average of the primitive pair extents : @xmath107 where @xmath14 and @xmath108 are contraction coefficients .",
    "for the purposes of determining @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for , e.g. ,  eq .  , the most diffuse exponent in the contraction is used for both standard and generally contracted basis sets .",
    "it is possible that a more efficient `` effective exponent '' formula could be developed , but a thorough investigation of screening for generally contracted basis sets is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the sv@xmath17 , qv@xmath17 , and sqv@xmath17estimators were implemented in a development version of the massively parallel quantum chemistry ( mpqc)@xcite package .",
    "we tested our estimates on a test set of three different molecular systems ",
    "benzene tetramer ( @xmath109-stacked geometry with an inter - monomer separation of @xmath110 ) , linear icosane , and a cluster of 29 water molecules ( cartesian coordinates in supplemental information)with five different basis set / auxiliary basis set pairs : cc - pvdz@xcite with cc - pvtz / jk,@xcite cc - pvtz with cc - pv5z / jk , def2-svp@xcite with def2-svp / c,@xcite aug - cc - pvtz with aug - cc - pvtz - ri,@xcite and ano - pvdz with aug - ano - pvtz.@xcite since the chemistry of the molecules tested is less relevant to the current context ( since the density matrix or other chemically important quantities are not involved in these estimates ) , the variety of basis sets with a variety of coefficients , exponents , and contraction schemes is more important to assessing the quality of the estimators than the variety of molecules examined .",
    "all error statistics were assessed with respect to shell - wise frobenius norms for both the estimates and the actual integral values .",
    "all bra shell pairs were prescreened with a schwarz threshold of @xmath111 ; that is , a bra pair @xmath19 was excluded from all statistics if @xmath112 while the choice of this pair prescreening threshold has a small effect on the averages and standard deviations of the statistics , the worst case behaviors are largely unaffected by this choice , since these usually arise from pairs composed of functions with different angular momenta on neighboring atoms .",
    "these pairs usually have relatively large schwarz estimates and are not affected by pair prescreening .",
    "estimated versus exact integral shell norms obtained for our standard test set of molecules with the cc - pvtz / cc - pv5z / jk bases , with @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the plots use a linear ( top ) and logarithmic ( bottom ) color scale , with color values representing the fraction of total integrals in a given 2d histogram bin ( of which there are 200 horizontal and 200 vertical ) .",
    "the green line in the bottom plot shows the boundary between the mostly empty histogram bins and the completely empty bins . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]        figure  [ fig : eva_all ] shows a heat map of the estimated versus exact shell norms obtained with the sqv@xmath17estimator ( @xmath113 , @xmath115 ) .",
    "the data were obtained for our standard test set of molecules and the cc - pvtz / cc - pv5z / jk basis set pair . using a linear color scale ( top plot ) , the estimator appears perfect ; i.e. , all data points fall along the ideal @xmath116 line . a more complete picture of performance appears only with a logarithmic color scale ( bottom plot ) .",
    "there are two bands in the plot .",
    "the first band follows closely the ideal line and contains the vast majority of the data points ; it can be identified with the well - separated integrals ( cases 1 and 2 in eq .  ) .",
    "the minor band below the ideal line contains the data points where the estimated values are significantly greater than the exact ones , which is typical of the schwarz - estimated integrals ( case 3 in eq .  ) .",
    "note that the sqv@xmath17estimator eliminates the vast majority of the overestimates that would occur with the pure schwarz screening . with still larger molecules or less diffuse basis sets",
    ", the schwarz band would be even less prominent .",
    "since sqv@xmath17is not an upper bound , a few integrals are _ under_estimated ( the data above the ideal line ) ; however this is an exceedingly rare occurrence .",
    "keep in mind that the cc - pvtz principal basis set and , particularly , the cc - pv5z / jk auxiliary basis set are much larger and utilize much higher angular momentum than those typically used for large molecule computations .",
    "indeed , the underestimated data points are almost not visible on heat maps for cc - pvdz / cc - pvtz / jk and def2-svp / def2-svp / c ( fourth and fifth plots , figure  [ fig : eva_alt ] ) ; i.e. , these plots look similar that for a hypothetical rigorous upper bound .",
    "the second and third plots in figure  [ fig : eva_alt ] show the difference between the pure sv@xmath17estimator ( @xmath117 ) and the pure qv@xmath17estimator ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the qv@xmath17shows much less density of integrals in the underestimation region above the main diagonal , but at the expense of a noticeable broadening of the estimates along the main diagonal relative to the sv@xmath17or sqv@xmath17estimators . finally , we note that in the first plot of figure  [ fig : eva_alt ] , the increase in the ws parameter relative to the data in figure  [ fig : eva_all ] does not change the picture much at all . for the molecules in our test set ,",
    "the majority of the integrals that are well - separated with @xmath119 are also well - separated with @xmath120 , so the difference is indistinguishable in this representation of the data .",
    "however , the outer limits indicating the worst over- and underestimates are basically identical for both @xmath94 values ; this suggests that the worst case behavior can be attributed to a poor representation of higher - order multipoles in the bra rather than a lack of well - separatedness .",
    "figure  [ fig : eva_am ] shows the data from figure  [ fig : eva_all ] split by angular momentum of the ket @xmath20 .",
    "notice that the main diagonal broadens with increasing @xmath121 .",
    "this is attributed to higher - order multipoles from the bra becoming more relevant with respect to their interaction with the ket as @xmath121 increases . in other words , integrals with larger @xmath121",
    "are inherently harder to estimate , which is not surprising given that they are _ significantly _ more expensive to compute .",
    "as expected , the schwarz band broadens and shifts further from the ideal as @xmath121 increases , because the distance factor ( omitted from the schwarz estimate ) becomes more important to an accurate estimate with increasing @xmath121 .",

    "first , the estimator usually performs worse for larger basis sets than the smaller ones , as noted earlier .",
    "the exception is the cc - pvdz / cc - pvtz / jk pair , which outperforms the def2-svp / def2-svp / c pair in terms of @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 ( though the @xmath129 values are slightly better for the latter pair ) .",
    "this exception is attributed to the presence of contracted functions in the def2-svp / c basis , while the cc - pvtz / jk basis is completely uncontracted .",
    "our simple handling of contracted estimates ( as discussed in section  [ sec : contr ] ) is to blame here .",
    "one could use the estimator on individual primitive triplets and then carry out the contraction , but we feel that this is a significant increase in effort for only a marginal increase in performance . indeed , though the ano - pvdz / aug - ano - pvtz results are by far the worst , they are impressively tenable given the massive simplification from section  [ sec : contr ] ( massive in the context of generally contracted basis sets , that is ) .    .statistics for the ratio @xmath130 for our test set of three molecules with various @xmath12 parameters and split by angular momentum @xmath121 of the auxiliary ket shell @xmath20 , with the cc - pvtz@xcite basis and the cc - pv5z / jk@xcite auxiliary basis and @xmath113 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     also note that while the average and standard deviation improve noticeably with the reduction of the @xmath12 parameter , the @xmath131 gets substantially worse .",
    "this is a result of the exclusion of higher order effects from the qv@xmath17 estimator which compensate for poor behavior in the worst edge cases at the expense of the average case .",
    "similarly , the decrease in the @xmath94 parameter comes at the cost of a roughly 30 - 40% decrease in the number of well - separated integrals ( and thus , in the number of integrals accessible to the distance - dependent part of the estimator ) .",
    "table [ tab : erram ] shows @xmath125 statistics for the shell triplets of cc - pvtz / cc - pv5z / jk grouped according to the ket angular momentum @xmath121 . due to the narrower variety of exponents and contraction schemes for the higher angular momentum in the cc - pv5z / jk basis set ,",
    "higher angular momentum estimates are more statistically accurate with respect to mean and @xmath132 , though the former is likely also a result of some error cancellation between over- and underestimates ( as evidenced by the @xmath117 and @xmath133 cases ) .",
    "however , the minimum ratios for higher angular momentum are lower . this latter behavior is anticipated , since one would expect the importance of higher order multipoles in the bra to be more pronounced for integrals with higher angular momentum in the ket . also , as the parameter @xmath12 increases , so does the consistency of the standard deviation with respect to angular momentum . for the pure sv@xmath17 case ,",
    "we see a much broader distribution for @xmath134 than for @xmath135 , while in the pure qv@xmath17 case , the standard deviation is nearly identical for all angular momenta .",
    "again , this is attributed to the greater importance of higher - order effects for larger angular momenta .",
    "( well - separated integrals only ) for our test set of molecules using the cc - pvtz / cc - pv5z / jk basis , with @xmath113 and @xmath114 using a linear ( top ) and logarithmic ( bottom ) color scale .",
    "ratios are normalized within each of 100 distance histogram bins so that the maximum in any given column is 1.0 .",
    "note the difference in vertical scales between the two plots.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]        figure  [ fig : rvd_all ] shows a 2d histogram of the ratio @xmath125 plotted against bra ",
    "ket separation @xmath136 , with a linear color scale in the top plot and a logarithmic color scale on the bottom plot ( note also the difference in the vertical scales ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rvd ] shows the same data split across ket angular momentum @xmath121 . in both figures ,",
    "each distance bin is normalized individually to the range @xmath137 $ ] . as with figure",
    "[ fig : eva_all ] , the linear color scale is relatively uninformative , except insofar as it shows that the vast majority of well - separated integrals are estimated almost exactly at all distances .",
    "the logarithmic color scale reveals that most of the overestimates occur for shorter separations and taper off with increasing distance .",
    "the same trend can particularly be seen for higher angular momentum in figure  [ fig : rvd ] .",
    "again , this shows that the higher angular momentum contributions to the bra are more important for integrals with higher ket angular momentum . at large bra - ket distances",
    "the estimator becomes more accurate due to the faster asymptotic decay of the contribution to the integral due to the higher angular momentum components to the bra .",
    "we have introduced the sqv@xmath17estimator for three - center eris . it is exact for some classes of integrals and",
    "is confirmed numerically to provide very tight estimates of the integrals for a wide variety of basis set types .",
    "the estimator incorporates the correct leading - order dependence on the bra - ket distance , thus significantly increasing the sparsity of the three - center eri tensor in reduced - scaling electronic structure methods .",
    "computing the sqv@xmath17estimate for a given shell triplet is relatively cheap ( on the order of a couple dozen cpu clock ticks ; a detailed analysis is dependent on the implementation details ) .",
    "thus many algorithms will see modest performance gains simply by incorporating the estimate directly into the integral computation without any index reordering or extra bookkeeping .",
    "more substantial gains are anticipated in algorithms that do not visit every shell triplet , even for the purposes of estimation .",
    "our basic tests performed outside of the context of any particular electronic structure method show that the norm of the most integrals in which the bra and ket are `` well - separated '' are estimated nearly perfectly , particularly for smaller basis sets that are more likely to be used for large molecule computations . our tests also show that the extent by which the integral norms are underestimated can be reduced readily without incurring explosion in computational cost .",
    "tuning the adjustable parameters of the estimator ( @xmath94 and @xmath12 ) in the context of a given electronic structure method will be a function of the target precision and should be determined , as always in atomic basis electronic structure , by benchmarking .",
    "the use of the estimator for reduced - scaling construction of the hartree - fock exchange with the concentric atomic density fitting approximation@xcite will be described in an upcoming manuscript .",
