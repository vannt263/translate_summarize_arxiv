    "ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 belongs to a large family of compounds of general formula a@xmath0abo@xmath2 , with ca , sr or ba on the a site , while the a and b sites can be occupied by a great variety of cations including many transition metal elements.@xcite the rhombohedral structure of these compounds consists of @xmath4 _ { \\infty } $ ] infinite chains running along the @xmath5-axis of the corresponding hexagonal cell , with the a cations located in between them ( see fig .",
    "these chains are made of alternating , face - sharing ao@xmath2 trigonal prisms and bo@xmath2 octahedra .",
    "each chain is surrounded by six equally spaced chains forming a triangular lattice in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "the intrachain a - b separation is quite small , whereas the interchain distance is approximately twice that distance ( for example about 2.6 and 5.2  , respectively , in the case of ca@xmath0co@xmath7o@xmath2).@xcite reinforcing this geometrical anisotropy , the oxygen atoms along the chains can efficiently mediate the intrachain coupling , whereas the a cations play no role in the interchain coupling . therefore , these compounds are expected to display pronounced one - dimensional ( 1d ) magnetic character .    amongst this family",
    ", ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 has attracted special interest in recent years due to its very peculiar magnetic properties.@xcite according to the most recent studies , @xcite both the cobalt ions in this compound are trivalent , but as they are subject to different crystalline - electric - fields ( cef ) , the co ions are in different spin states . as pointed out by aasland _",
    "et al._,@xcite the cef - induced splitting of the 3d orbitals produces a gap between a lower triplet and an upper doublet that is larger in an octahedral environment than in a prismatic one . as a consequence , the 3d@xmath8 configuration of co@xmath9 can produce a high - spin state ( @xmath10 ) on the prismatic site and a low - spin state ( @xmath11 ) on the octahedral site .",
    "although indisputable evidence is still absent , this scenario is the most consistent with the neutron diffraction data and the magnetic measurements that are available at the present time.@xcite at high temperatures , it must be borne in mind that the situation may be complicated by a progressive transition from the low - spin state to the intermediate - spin state ( @xmath12 ) and/or the high - spin state.@xcite    the previous studies on ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 have established several basic features about the co - co interactions in this compound : ( i ) a strong ising - character,@xcite with the spins oriented along the chain axis ; ( ii ) a ferromagnetic intrachain coupling ; ( iii ) an antiferromagnetic ( nearest - neighbor ) interchain coupling .",
    "such features , combined with the triangular arrangement of the chains on the @xmath6 plane , give rise to a prototypical situation of geometrical frustration .",
    "ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 is also reported to exhibit peculiar magnetic behaviour , especially in @xmath13 curves.@xcite for instance , a sequence of irreversible metamagnetic transitions take place at very low @xmath3 ( 5 k ) , in the so - called frozen spin state , while there is a sharp ferrimagnetic - to - ferromagnetic transition at intermediate temperatures around 10 k. complex phase diagrams have been proposed.@xcite some features of these phase diagrams are still the subject of controversy .",
    "one of the most debated issues deals with the ordering process under zero or low field .",
    "et al._@xcite have proposed a scenario similar to the one developed by mekata _",
    "et al._@xcite for cscocl@xmath0 ( antiferromagnetic ising chains , antiferromagnetically coupled on a triangular lattice).@xcite upon cooling , this model predicts an initial transition to a partially disordered antiferromagnetic ( pda ) state , in which two thirds of the chains are antiferromagnetically coupled while the last third remains incoherent,@xcite followed by a second transition to a ferrimagnetic state at lower @xmath3 . whether this scenario is applicable to the case of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 has recently been questioned.@xcite to date no specific heat measurements have been performed on this compound , although such thermal data would be valuable in understanding the physics of this material .    in this paper",
    ", we report on specific heat measurements under an applied magnetic field , carried out on ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals .",
    "the magnetic field has allowed us to investigate the ordering process in the various magnetic states adopted by this material : disordered antiferromagnetic , ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic .",
    "such a study had to be carried out on single crystals due to the highly anisotropic properties of this compound.@xcite this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to experimental details , and in particular details of the single - crystal alignment procedure and the subtraction of the lattice contribution to the specific heat .",
    "section iii reports the specific heat data under zero field and large magnetic fields , along with the corresponding magnetization measurements .",
    "the results are discussed in section iv and our conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "single crystals were grown using a flux method described previously .",
    "@xcite this method yielded needle - like crystals - similar to those used for magnetic measurements in ref .",
    "6 -along with other specimens that have an aspect ratio that is more suitable for specific heat measurements .",
    "these latter crystals have the shape of short hexagonal rods terminating in three diamondlike faces at each end .",
    "their small size ( @xmath14 mm@xmath15 ) makes it difficult to get reliable specific heat data on only one crystal .",
    "we have used a set of four crystals with a total mass of 10.64 mg .",
    "magnetic measurements carried out on each crystal verified the good homogeneity of this assembly .",
    "all magnetic and specific heat measurements reported in this paper were recorded with the magnetic field along the @xmath5 axis of the crystals .",
    "the crystals were aligned using the following procedure : ( i ) at 300 k , the four crystals were put into a small amount of apiezon n grease ( contained in a gelatine capsule , or on the measuring platform , for magnetization or specific heat , respectively ) ; ( ii ) a magnetic field of 5 t is then applied .",
    "owing to the substantial magnetic anisotropy persisting up to room temperature in this compound , the samples experience a torque which tends to align their @xmath5-axis along the direction of the applied field .",
    "we checked that 5 t is large enough to rotate our crystals in apiezon n at 300 k , a temperature at which this grease has a low viscosity ; ( iii ) the samples are then slowly cooled under 5 t down to 150 k. this ensures the field alignment is maintained through the glass transition of apiezon n  grease that occurs around 230 k;@xcite ( iv ) at 150 k , the grease is solid enough to hold the samples in position without a magnetic field , while the temperature is still above the magnetic transitions of the compound .",
    "the field is reduced to zero , and the cooling is resumed to prepare the samples in a zero field cooled ( zfc ) state .",
    "the quality of the alignment obtained by this method was demonstrated by the sharpness of the ferrimagnetic - to - ferromagnetic transition and the magnetization values at the associated plateaus .",
    "the specific heat measurements were carried out by a two - tau relaxation method ( ppms , quantum design ) with magnetic fields up to 5 t and temperatures down to 2 k. a background signal ( platform and grease ) was recorded versus temperature under each field investigated .",
    "magnetization measurements were carried out on the same set of crystals , by means of a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( mpms , quantum design ) , with magnetic fields up to 5 t and temperatures down to 2 k.    in order to subtract the lattice contribution to heat capacity , a non - magnetic isostructural compound was synthesized .",
    "a  ceramic sample of ca@xmath16pto@xmath2 was prepared from a stoichiometric mixture of cao and pto@xmath17 .",
    "these starting materials were pelleterized in the form of bars and heated in a evacuated silica ampoule at 800@xmath18 for 12 h. x - ray diffraction verified the single phase of the ca@xmath19pto@xmath2 compound , and confirmed that this material has the same rhombohedral structure as ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 . in ca@xmath19pto@xmath2 ,",
    "the ca@xmath20 cations occupy the trigonal prisms , while the pt@xmath21(3d@xmath8 ) on the octahedral sites are supposed to be in a low - spin state ( @xmath11 ) due to a large cef - induced gap .",
    "to check this point , magnetic measurements were performed between 2 and 300 k , leading to a susceptibility of the form @xmath22 , with @xmath23 emu k mol@xmath24 .",
    "this curie constant is about 0.05% of the value expected for high - spin pt@xmath21 ( @xmath10 ) , and 0.15% of the value expected for intermediate - spin pt@xmath21 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this result ensures that the specific - heat data of ca@xmath19pto@xmath2 ( up to 300 k ) does not contain a significant magnetic contribution from the electronic spins .",
    "furthermore , the data down to 2 k for both compounds reveals no contribution from a schottky term related to nuclear level splitting .",
    "finally , one can also safely discard the presence of a significant electronic term in these compounds owing to their poor electrical conductivity.@xcite one can thus consider that the specific heat of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 , in the range 2 - 300 k , is made up of two terms : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the lattice contribution related to phonon excitations , while @xmath27 is the magnetic term that we are interested in .    the contribution @xmath28 of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 can be derived from the total specific heat @xmath29 of ca@xmath19pto@xmath2 , but the difference in molecular weight between the two compounds must be taken into account .",
    "there is no generally accepted method to do this , and some approximations have to be made . within the framework of the debye approach , the lattice contribution is determined only by the ratio @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the debye temperature , which depends on the structure and the mass of the constituent atoms.@xcite accordingly , the correction of mass amounts to the determination of the ratio @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the debye temperatures of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 and ca@xmath19pto@xmath2 , respectively . since @xmath33 in the basic monoatomic model is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass , one can get a first estimate by using the molecular weights , leading to @xmath35 .",
    "a more sophisticated method based on the principle of corresponding states has been developed by stout and catalano .",
    "@xcite this technique is based on the comparison of the specific heat data at high temperatures for the magnetic and the reference compounds .",
    "it has the great advantage of accounting for a temperature dependence in the parameter @xmath36 , but , on the other hand , it requires an extrapolation of @xmath36 in the low @xmath3  range ( below about 190 k in our case ) which introduces a significant uncertainty . following the extrapolations proposed in ref .",
    "16 , we found @xmath37 at low @xmath3 . in the present study",
    ", we also have the opportunity to derive an experimental estimate of @xmath36 by analysing the low - temperature dependence of the specific heat data .",
    "indeed , the lattice contribution is reduced to a term @xmath38 at low temperature , with @xmath39 . in a @xmath40-vs-@xmath41 plot ,",
    "both the curves of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 and ca@xmath19pto@xmath2 exhibit a linear regime at low @xmath3 from which one can extract @xmath42 values leading to @xmath43 ^{1/3}=1.13 $ ] .    in the analysis presented hereafter , we chose to retain this latter value , which appeared to us as the best compromise between simplicity and reliability .",
    "however , we will take the uncertainty on the @xmath36 value into account when discussing the comparison of @xmath44 with theoretical predictions ( sec .",
    "since one can write @xmath45 within the framework of the debye model , the lattice contribution of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 has been derived by multiplying the temperature values of the total specific heat data @xmath29 of ca@xmath19pto@xmath2 by  @xmath46 .",
    "figure 2 shows the total specific heat versus temperature for ca@xmath0co@xmath17o@xmath2 measured under zero - field , along with the estimated lattice contribution obtained by using the procedure described above . the main feature is a prominent peak in the raw data around 25 k , indicative of a long - range ordering ( lro ) .",
    "it can also be observed that the total specific heat @xmath47 tends to merge with the lattice contribution @xmath28 at high @xmath48 .",
    "the inset displays an enlargement of the low @xmath3 portion of the data as a @xmath40-vs-@xmath41 plot .",
    "three separate runs are shown together , which illustrate the good reproducibility of the @xmath47 data .",
    "this plot also shows that the lattice term has a simple cubic temperature dependence ( @xmath49 , as expected for such contributions .",
    "we found @xmath50 @xmath51 j k@xmath52 mol@xmath24 , leading to a debye temperature @xmath53 k. beside this lattice term , the specific heat of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 exhibits a linear contribution @xmath54 ( @xmath55 mj k@xmath56 mol@xmath57 , and one can see the development of magnetic excitations above @xmath58 k.    figure 3 shows the magnetic part of the specific heat , @xmath59 , under zero - field . beyond the sharp peak around 25 k ,",
    "@xcite there is a broad bump at higher temperatures . because of increased scatter in the data at high @xmath3 , which is further enhanced by the subtraction procedure",
    ", the curve has been cut above 200 k. the inset shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy @xmath60 .",
    "the peak in @xmath44 at 25 k yields a significant change in the rate of entropy variation around this temperature .",
    "it should be noted that the entropy at the lro transition , @xmath61 k@xmath62 is equal to 18 % of the total magnetic entropy .",
    "this small value is consistent with the expected behaviour in a 1d system.@xcite one can also note that @xmath63 at high @xmath3 tends to saturate just below the expected value for one cobalt of spin 2 per formula unit ( @xmath64 .    before showing the specific heat results under magnetic field ,",
    "let us consider the corresponding magnetization data .",
    "figure 4 shows an enlargement of @xmath65-susceptibility curves for an applied field of 0.1 t , 2 t and 5 t , and focusses on the region around the transition at 25 k. in both 2 t and 5 t , one observes a small difference between the zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooling ( fc ) curves at very low @xmath3 ( @xmath3 5 k ) , a behaviour which is consistent with the large hysteresis displayed by the @xmath13 curves in the same temperature range.@xcite above this irreversible regime , the low @xmath3 plateaus of the curves under 2 t and 5 t correspond to magnetizations equal to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , where @xmath67 is the full spin polarization.@xcite this is consistent with the ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic natures of the low @xmath3 states in 2 t and 5 t , respectively , that have been reported previously .",
    "@xcite let us now turn to the corresponding specific heat data recorded in 0 t , 2 t and 5 t after zfc .",
    "even below 5 k , no significant hysteresis could be detected between the zfc and the fc curves in the @xmath47 data .",
    "furthermore , we checked that there is no difference between the @xmath47 curves recorded under 0 t or 0.1 t. figure 5 shows the @xmath68 curves under field which were derived by subtracting @xmath28 from the raw data .",
    "the 2 t data exhibit a very large , lambda - like peak at 25 k. it must be emphasized that the height of this peak is much larger than that found under 0 t. in 5 t , there is only a smooth bump around 25 k. this is consistent with the expected behaviour for a long - range ferromagnetic transition in a large field . in the low @xmath3 regime",
    ", one observes that the 2 t curve lies well below the data collected with no field applied .",
    "one can get a better insight into this low @xmath3 range by considering the temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy as displayed in fig .",
    "the curves for 0 and 2 t are close to each other below about @xmath69 k and above @xmath70 . in the intermediate range ,",
    "the entropy in 0 t is much larger than in 2 t.    figure 6(b ) shows the zfc susceptibility curves in the same temperature range , that were recorded under 0.1 t with a waiting time @xmath71 after each temperature stabilization equal to either 5 seconds or 600 seconds . although @xmath72 starts increasing abruptly at @xmath70 ( see also fig .",
    "4 ) , the maximum slope in the zfc curves is actually found at @xmath73 k. in between @xmath74 k and @xmath75 k , the zfc  curve exhibits a pronounced relaxation effect .",
    "below @xmath75 k , @xmath72 becomes time - independent and is roughly constant down to 2 k.",
    "in the literature on ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 , the existence of two critical temperatures at @xmath76 ( @xmath77 k ) and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 k ) has often been invoked : the first has been associated with a ferromagnetic intrachain transition , while the second is identified with an antiferromagnetic transition between the ferromagnetic chains .",
    "one of the main pieces of information provided directly by our specific heat investigations is the sharp peak observed at 25 k in the @xmath47 data under zero - field .",
    "this feature clearly demonstrates the occurrence of a collective magnetic transition . since it is well known that such long - range ordering ( lro ) can not take place in one dimension , this feature can not be ascribed to a ferromagnetic transition along the chains .",
    "the scenario described above is thus inconsistent with the specific heat data .",
    "we propose that there is a collective transition at @xmath80 k corresponding to an antiferromagnetic coupling between the chains .",
    "note this is consistent with the emergence of antiferromagnetic bragg peaks around 25 k in neutron diffraction data.@xcite however , the entropy jump associated with this transition shows that the antiferromagnetic ordering is far from being complete . at the same time ,",
    "the development of a long - range interchain ordering , even if it is partial , can reduce the magnetic fluctuations along the chains .",
    "this could explain why the antiferromagnetic ordering at @xmath70 is accompanied by a sudden increase of the susceptibility .",
    "the existence of a lro transition at a rather high temperature in ca@xmath0co@xmath7o@xmath2 emphasizes a clear departure from the pure ising triangular antiferromagnet which has a totally frustrated ground state.@xcite one of the most likely origins for such a lifting of degeneracy is the influence of next - nearest interchain interactions.@xcite some studies of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 proposed a scenario involving a pda ( partially disordered antiferromagnetic ) state,@xcite which implies af nearest - neighbor coupling and f next - nearest  neighbours coupling . in this model ,",
    "the decrease of temperature first induces a transition at @xmath81 to a pda state , followed at @xmath82 by a transition to a ferrimagnetic state.@xcite this process is supposed to give rise to a smooth peak in specific heat at @xmath83 and a large one at @xmath84 .",
    "this is in contrast with our experimental results in ca@xmath0co@xmath7o@xmath2 , since we observed a sharp peak at the first transition , while no additional peak exists at lower temperatures .",
    "it should be noted , however , that even in the abx@xmath0 compounds ( a = cs , rb , and b = co ) for which this model was developed , the specific heat data do not show clear support for the theoretical expectations.@xcite it was argued that the transition to ferrimagnetism might be prevented by the establishment of a glassy phase at low temperatures.@xcite in ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 , this latter phase could be the frozen spin state which was found in magnetization studies.@xcite our specific heat measurements show that the transition to the frozen spin state ( @xmath85 k ) is associated with a noticeable change of regime in a @xmath40-vs-@xmath41 plot ( see inset of fig .",
    "2 ) . in the low @xmath3 regime ,",
    "the specific heat exhibits a linear term with @xmath86 mj k@xmath56 mol@xmath24 .",
    "such a feature is usually found in spin glasses@xcite and in other disordered magnetic systems such as mixed - valent manganites.@xcite we can thus speculate that this linear contribution reflects the disorder that remains in the chain system of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 at low @xmath3 .    as for the shape of the peak at @xmath83",
    ", it was found that it could vary considerably with the level of frustration.@xcite depending on the signs and respective values of the first , second and third neighbor interactions in a 2d ising triangular antiferromagnet , monte carlo simulations showed that a large variety of @xmath47 curves can be expected , including a single large peak at @xmath87 our observations are thus consistent with such a generalized pda scenario , while they seem to rule out the standard picture proposed earlier.@xcite    the specific heat measurements provide us with information about the entropy variation in between @xmath88 and @xmath70 . in an applied field of 2 t , ca@xmath89co@xmath1o@xmath2 undergoes a transition from a disordered state ( system of uncoupled chains ) to a ferrimagnetic state .",
    "the specific heat data exhibit a very large , sharp peak at @xmath70 , which is much more pronounced than under zero - field .",
    "the magnetic entropies calculated at @xmath70 , however , are found to be the same under both fields .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field only affects the way the entropy evolves below @xmath70 . in an applied field of 2 t , the magnetic phase at low temperature is well ordered ( ferrimagnetic state ) , so there is a sudden large release of entropy just around @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , the transition under zero - field is more progressive .",
    "although there is a noticeable change of entropy at @xmath70 , it is much smaller than under 2 t , and the entropy is progressively reduced as the temperature is decreased further .",
    "the difference between the @xmath90 curves under 0 t and 2 t can give direct insight into the large magnetic disorder that persists far below @xmath70 under zero field .",
    "upon cooling below @xmath70 , the slow decrease of entropy in zero - field is interrupted by the spin freezing at @xmath85 k. this is also the temperature at which the @xmath90 curves at 0 t and 2 t  are found to merge onto each other .",
    "another aspect of this ordering process is revealed by magnetization data at low field , which showed that a pronounced relaxation effect takes place below @xmath70 .",
    "this effect starts above @xmath88 , which is consistent with the fact that one can not expect significant effects over short time scales ( i.e. 600 seconds ) in a frozen spin state .",
    "this large relaxation effect [ fig .",
    "6(b ) ] indicates that the magnetic disorder revealed by the specific heat measurements [ fig .",
    "6(a ) ] evolves with time .",
    "this behaviour is probably related to the frustration and the slow dynamics associated with spin reversals in ferromagnetic chains.@xcite      another striking feature of the magnetic contribution to the specific heat is the existence of a broad maximum at high temperatures , well above @xmath70 . actually , such a result is theoretically expected in a 1d magnetic compound , owing to the development of short - range ordering along the chains .",
    "@xcite from an experimental point of view however , there are not so many reports on such features , in particular for ising systems . to our knowledge , the only clear report of such a broad maximum with ising ferromagnetic chains dealt with cocl@xmath91nc@xmath92h@xmath92.@xcite the temperature of the maximum ( @xmath93 in @xmath44 as well as its height ( @xmath94",
    "are predicted to increase with the spin value.@xcite this could explain why this broad maximum is so visible in our case while it is generally hidden by the lro transition in ising systems with smaller spin values . according to theoretical predictions for a ising system with @xmath10 , one should expect @xmath95 and @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the intrachain coupling and the gas constant , respectively.@xcite in our case , @xmath99 is found to be close to @xmath75 rather than @xmath100 j k@xmath24mol@xmath24 , but it should be noted that @xmath99 is quite sensitive to the value of the @xmath36 parameter used in the subtraction of the lattice contribution ( e.g. one finds @xmath101 11 j k@xmath24mol@xmath24 for @xmath102 . in contrast , @xmath103 is found to be essentially independent of the @xmath36 value in the range @xmath104 .",
    "this characteristic temperature leads to @xmath105 k , while kageyama _",
    "et al . _ reported @xmath106 k from an analysis of the susceptibility at high @xmath3.@xcite taking into account that this latter analysis may also contain some uncertainties , one can consider that there is a reasonable overall agreement between the experimental @xmath44 data and the theoretical expectations for short - range excitations in an @xmath10 ising chain .",
    "it must be emphasized that a totally different phenomenon may contribute to the existence of a broad peak in @xmath44 .",
    "the cobalt ions in the octahedral sites that are in low - spin ( ls ) state at low @xmath3 could change their spin state to high or intermediate spin states ( hs or is ) as @xmath3  is increased .",
    "such a phenomenon is currently the source of intensive debate@xcite in the case of lacoo@xmath0 , which also contains ls co@xmath107 on octahedral sites at low @xmath3 . rather than a true spin state transition ,",
    "an increase in temperature can induce a progressive thermal population of the is and/or hs levels .",
    "such a process will have a pronounced signature in @xmath44 , in the form of a schottky anomaly.@xcite therefore , a spin - state crossover , if it occurs , could contribute to the bump seen in specific heat at high @xmath3.@xcite accordingly , it is worth noting that the existence of such an additional phenomenon could affect to some extent the analysis of the bump in @xmath44 in terms of pure short - range spin ordering .",
    "the interplay between the short - range spin ordering and a possible spin - state crossover must be very complex , and at the present time , it seems difficult to separate the two effects simply on the basis of specific heat and/or magnetization data .",
    "it is clear that more direct investigations of the co spin states in ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 are required to proceed further with this analysis .",
    "our specific heat investigations in ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 have revealed several features that complement the previous magnetization studies .",
    "we have shown that there is a peak at @xmath80 k in @xmath44 under an applied field of 0 t and 2 t. this feature clearly demonstrates the occurrence of a long - range ordering associated with the antiferromagnetic interchain coupling . in 5 t , there is no longer a peak in the data , as expected for a ferromagnetic transition in a large magnetic field .",
    "in an applied field of 2 t , the ordered state is ferrimagnetic and the peak at @xmath108 is found to be very pronounced . under zero field , the peak at @xmath70 is significantly reduced ; the magnetic entropy displays a smooth , continuous evolution versus temperature below @xmath70 , that is interrupted when entering the frozen spin state around @xmath85 k. one observes a pronounced crossover in the temperature dependence of @xmath44 around @xmath109 . below @xmath88 ,",
    "the specific heat has a linear term ( @xmath54 ) that can be associated with frozen magnetic disorder .",
    "it must be emphasized that no additional peak was detected in @xmath44 below @xmath70 , which appears to rule out a ferrimagnetic transition as proposed by some pda scenarios.@xcite    magnetization measurements revealed a noticeable time dependence in the intermediate temperature range between @xmath88 and @xmath70 .",
    "the combination of our specific heat and magnetization results demonstrates that the magnetic state below @xmath70 under zero field is still highly disordered and evolves continuously with both temperature and time .",
    "this feature probably derives from a combination of geometric frustration and the slow spin dynamics of ferromagnetic chains .",
    "the magnetic heat capacity exhibits a broad maximum at high @xmath3 which can be related to one - dimensional short - range ordering along the ferromagnetic chains .",
    "the fact that only a small fraction ( @xmath110 0.18 ) of the total magnetic entropy @xmath111 @xmath112 $ ] is released up to @xmath70 is consistent with the expectations for a 1d system .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 and a few other compounds of the same family@xcite seem to be the only model systems for the case of ising ferromagnetic chains , antiferromagnetically coupled on a triangular lattice .",
