    "it is well - known that observability and detectability are fundamental concepts in system analysis and synthesis ; see , e.g. , @xcite . in the linear system theory ,",
    "detectability is a weaker concept than observability , since it describes the fact that all unobservable states are asymptotically stable . over the last two decades ,",
    "the classical detectability in the linear system theory has been extended to stochastic systems in different ways .",
    "for example , the definition of stochastic detectability for time - invariant it stochastic systems can be found in @xcite , which is dual to mean square stabilization . in @xcite",
    ", the notions of exact observability and exact detectability were presented for it stochastic systems , which led to the stochastic popov - belevitch - hautus ( pbh ) criteria like those for deterministic systems .",
    "another natural concept of detectability for it stochastic systems was given in @xcite based on the idea that any non - observed states corresponded to stable models of the system .",
    "in @xcite , the exact detectability in @xcite and detectability in @xcite were proved to be equivalent , and a unified treatment was proposed for detectability and observability of it stochastic systems .",
    "based on the standard notions of detectability and observability for time - varying linear systems @xcite , studied in @xcite were detectability and observability of discrete time - invariant stochastic systems as well as the properties of lyapunov equations .",
    "recently , the exact detectability and observability were extended to stochastic systems with markov jumps and multiplicative noise in @xcite .    as it is well known that the classical lyapunov theorem is very essential in stability theory , which asserts that if a matrix @xmath6 is schur stable , then for any @xmath7",
    ", the classical lyapunov equation @xmath8 admits a unique solution @xmath9 ; conversely , if @xmath10 is detectable , @xmath7 , and the lyapunov equation @xmath8 admits a unique solution @xmath9 , then @xmath6 is schur stable .",
    "the classical lyapunov theorem was generalized to deterministic time - varying systems in @xcite and will be extended to stochastic time - varying systems in this paper under any one assumption of uniform detectability , @xmath11-exact detectability and @xmath11-exact observability .",
    "recently it has become known that discrete - time stochastic systems with multiplicative noise are ideal models in the fields of investment portfolio optimization @xcite , system biology @xcite and so on .",
    "so the discrete - time stochastic @xmath12 control and filtering design have been extensively studied in recent years ; see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein . as it is well - known , time - varying systems may be utilized to model more realistic systems and are more challenging in mathematics than time - invariant ones .",
    "so far , the majority of the existing results is focused on detectability of time - invariant systems only , except for a few about time - varying systems ; see @xcite .",
    "because linear time - invariant systems are not sufficient to describe many practical phenomena , this motivates researchers to study time - varying systems . in the classical work @xcite , uniform detectability of the deterministic linear discrete - time time - varying ( ldtv ) system @xmath13",
    "was defined and discussed . by the duality of stochastic stabilizability ,",
    "another definition called  stochastic detectability \" was introduced in @xcite for ldtv markov systems , which is not equivalent to uniform detectability in time - varying case .",
    "mainly motivated by the preceding discussion and the authors series works @xcite , this paper will study detectability , observability and lyapunov - type equation related to ldtv stochastic systems with multiplicative noise .",
    "firstly , the classical uniform detectability of @xcite for such systems is extended , and some properties on uniform detectability are obtained . by means of our lemma  [ lem:2.1 ] given later , we obtain the observability gramian matrix @xmath14 and the state transition matrix @xmath15 , which are deterministic matrices and easy to be applied in practice . specifically , we prove an important theorem that uniform detectability preserves invariance under an output feedback control law , which is expected to be useful in stochastic @xmath12 control . as an application , under the assumption of uniform detectability , lyapunov - type theorems on stochastic stability are also presented .    secondly , we extend exact detectability of linear continuous - time stochastic it systems @xcite to ldtv systems . we introduce four concepts called @xmath3-exact detectability , @xmath2-exact detectability , @xmath1-exact detectability and @xmath16-exact detectability , and they in turn become weaker in the sense that the former implies the latter in a sequence .",
    "although in linear time - invariant system @xmath17 these four concepts are equivalent with @xmath18 , but they are different from the others in the time - varying case , which reveals the essential difference between time - invariant and time - varying systems . it is shown that uniform detectability implies @xmath19-exact detectability ( see lemma  [ lem:3.1.3 ] ) , and stochastic detectability @xcite implies the above four types of exact detectability ( see proposition  [ prop:3.1.1 ] and remark  [ rem:3.1.3 ] ) .",
    "it seems that there is no inclusion relation among uniform detectability , @xmath3-exact detectability , @xmath2-exact detectability and @xmath20-exact detectability , although they can be unified in the linear discrete time - invariant systems @xcite .",
    "two important lyapunov - type theorems under @xmath3-exact detectability for periodic systems are obtained ( see theorems  [ thm:5.3.1][thm:5.3.2 ] ) , which reveal the important relation between the exponential stability and the existence of positive definite solutions of generalized lyapunov equations ( gles ) .",
    "parallel to various definitions on exact detectability , we also introduce @xmath3-exact observability , @xmath2-exact observability , @xmath1-exact observability and @xmath19-exact observability , which are respectively stronger than @xmath3-exact detectability , @xmath2-exact detectability , @xmath1-exact detectability and @xmath19-exact detectability . for the linear time - invariant system ( [ eq vgthgh ] ) , @xmath21- , @xmath2- , @xmath20- and @xmath16-exact observability are equivalent , but they are different definitions for the linear time - varying system ( [ eq vfhv ] ) .",
    "we present a rank criterion for @xmath19- and a criterion for @xmath3-exact observability based on the gramian matrix @xmath22 .",
    "finally , under the assumption of @xmath3-exact observability , a lyapunov - type theorem is derived from theorem  [ thm:5.3.1 ] .",
