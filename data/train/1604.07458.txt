    "the hydrodynamic equation is expressed in terms of macroscopic quantities such as the pressure , particle number density , and fluid velocity , and takes a universal form irrespective of the microscopic dynamics of the system .",
    "the detailed microscopic properties of the system are renormalized into transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity , heat conductivity and so on . therefore , the elaborate investigation of the transport coefficients is one of the most important tasks to reveal the microscopic properties of the fluid .",
    "for instance , the fluid with a tiny shear viscosity is realized in the experiment of ultracold fermi gases at the unitarity @xcite : the value of its shear viscosity is close to a quantum bound that is theoretically proposed @xcite , implying the realization of the strongly correlated systems at the unitarity @xcite . the hydrodynamic behavior with a small shear viscosity is also discovered in the ultra - relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , which may again suggest that the created matter , i.e. , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a strongly coupled system ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , for instance ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that , in spite of very large difference of the energy scale , these systems share common hydrodynamic properties , and the hydrodynamic equation provides us with a unified way to study their dynamics .    however , there is a problem in the application of the navier - stokes equation , besides the causality problem typical to the relativistic hydrodynamics : in finite systems , there are the central region where the density is large enough to apply the naive viscous hydrodynamic equation , and the peripheral region where the naive hydrodynamic description breaks down due to the small density . in the latter ,",
    "since the system slowly approaches the thermal equilibrium state due to the lack of enough collision rate , we need to take into account more microscopic dynamics . to this end , we should incorporate the relaxation process of dissipative currents , which is characterized by viscous relaxation times @xcite .",
    "the second - order hydrodynamic equation describes the mesoscopic dynamics including the relaxation of the dissipative currents , in addition to the ordinary hydrodynamic behavior described by the navier - stokes equation .",
    "it should be emphasized that , though the importance of the second - order hydrodynamics has been recognized and many attempts has been done to derive it , its formulation is still controversial @xcite .    in this paper , we derive the second - order hydrodynamic equation from the boltzmann equation for non - relativistic systems by using the renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite . in the rg method",
    ", we faithfully solve the boltzmann equation and extract the hydrodynamics as a low - energy effective dynamics of the kinetic theory .",
    "it has been applied to derive the first- and second - order hydrodynamic equations for both relativistic and non - relativistic systems @xcite , and desirable properties have been already shown for the resultant equation such as causality , stability , positivity of the entropy production rate , and the onsager s reciprocal relation without imposing any assumption a priori @xcite . moreover , the microscopic expressions obtained for the transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity , heat conductivity and so on coincide with those derived in the celebrated chapman - enskog method , while the novel microscopic expressions of the viscous relaxation times written in terms of the relaxation functions allow physically natural interpretations as the relaxation times . as an extension of ref .",
    "@xcite , we take account of the effect of quantum statistics and external forces . as an application , we use our microscopic expressions to calculate the shear viscosity , heat conductivity , and viscous relaxation times of the stress tensor and heat flow of the cold fermionic atoms in a quantitative way , where the transition amplitude in the collision term is given explicitly in terms of the @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath2 : the microscopic expressions given in forms of correlation functions are converted to linear integral equations , which we solve numerically without recourse to any approximation . on the basis of the numerical results , we discuss the quantum statistical effects , temperature dependence , and scattering - length dependence of the first - order transport coefficients and the viscous relaxation times : it is shown that at low temperatures , quantum statistics acts so effectively that the transport coefficients and the relaxation times increase rapidly because pauli principle almost forbids particle scatterings other than the forward ones .",
    "on the other hand , as @xmath2 is increased up to unitarity , these quantities decrease monotonically and become vanishingly small at unitarity because of the strong coupling .",
    "we also examine how well the relation @xmath3 and its analog for the heat conductivity are satisfied , where @xmath5 is the viscous relaxation time of the stress tensor , @xmath6 the shear viscosity , and @xmath7 the pressure .",
    "these relations are obtained from the boltzmann equation with use of the relaxation - time approximation ( rta ) , which has been widely applied to a lot of studies of the kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "although the rta might happen to be valid for a system close to the local equilibrium , its quantitative reliability is unclear and has been hardly checked even apart from the fact that the relaxation times should have different values depending on the realization process : we are only aware of @xcite in which the validity of the rta is analytically examined up to some approximations .",
    "we show that the relation @xmath3 holds quite well , while the similar relation for the relaxation time @xmath4 of the heat conductivity is satisfied only approximately with a considerable error . here",
    "we should mention that a brief report of the present work is already given in ref .",

    "it is noteworthy that the error of @xmath4 caused by the rta for the fermi gas decreases at low temperature in contrast to that for classical gas , which is independent of temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_rta ] ) .",
    "this behavior may be understood as follows : the rta is a kind of the linear approximation of the collision integral with respect to the deviation of the distribution function from the equilibrium one .",
    "the deviation is attributed to the excitations of quasi - particles due to the nonequilibrium process and decreases in the cold fermionic gases since the pauli - blocking effect suppresses the excitation of the quasi - particles inside the fermi sphere .",
    "therefore the linear approximation work well and the rta reproduces the exact value of the viscous relaxation time of the heat conductivity .",
    "it is noted that the expressions and derived with the rta can be obtained by a closure approximation @xmath211 in the exact expressions given by eqs .   and .",

    "<S> we thereby discuss the quantum statistical effects , temperature dependence , and scattering - length dependence of the first - order transport coefficients and the viscous relaxation times : it is shown that as the temperature is lowered , the transport coefficients and the relaxation times increase rapidly because pauli principle acts effectively . on the other hand , as @xmath2 is increased , these quantities decrease and become vanishingly small at unitarity because of the strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical calculation shows that the relation @xmath3 , which is derived in the relaxation - time approximation and used in most of literature without almost any foundation , turns out to be satisfied quite well , while the similar relation for the relaxation time @xmath4 of the heat conductivity is satisfied only approximately with a considerable error . </S>"
