    "three more these kinds of examples have been shown in fig . 1 of si where the coupled networks are based on states - level influenza data and cities - level measles data , respectively .",

    "when @xmath9 satisfies @xmath68 , the epidemics can not survive in each of the networks @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "when @xmath9 is in between @xmath70 and @xmath71 , some interesting results may be induced by coupling .",
    "when coupling is weak , it is possible for epidemic to outbreak only in network @xmath12 but not in network @xmath13 .",
    "once coupling is increased , it will be also possible for epidemic to outbreak sometimes in network @xmath13 , i.e. resulting a mixed outbreak phase . when coupling is further increased to large enough",

    "so far , the reported results are from the er random networks @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we are wondering whether it is possible to still observe the phenomenon of the synchronized and mixed outbreak phases in other network topologies .",

    "7 - 9 in si for details .",
    "therefore , the synchronized and mixed outbreak phases are a general phenomenon in multi - layered epidemic networks .    in sum , the epidemic spreading has been well studied in the past decades , mainly focused on both the single and multi - layered networks . however , only a few works focused on the aspect of recurrent epidemics , including both the models in homogeneous population @xcite and our recent model in a single network @xcite",
    ". we here report from the real data that the epidemics from different networks are in fact not isolated but correlated , implying that they should be considered as a multi - layered network .",
    "motivated by this discovery , we present a two - layered network model to reproduce the correlated recurrent epidemics in coupled networks .",
    "more importantly , we find that this model can reproduce both the synchronized and mixed outbreak phases in real data .",
    "the two - layered network is preferred to show the synchronized phase when the average degrees of the two coupled networks have a large difference and shows the mixed phase when their average degrees are very close . except the degree difference between the two networks , the coupling strength between the two layers has also significant influence to the synchronized and mixed outbreak phases .",
    "we show that both the larger @xmath22 and larger @xmath18 are in favor of the synchronized phase but suppress the mixed phase .",
    "this finding thus shows a new way to understand the epidemics in realistic multi - layered networks .",
    "its further studies and potential applications in controlling the recurrent epidemics may be an interesting topic in near future .",
    "we consider a two - layered network model with coupling between its two layers , i.e. the networks @xmath12 and @xmath13 in fig .",

    "we may image the network @xmath12 as a human contact network for one geographic region and the network @xmath13 for a separated region .",
    "each node in the two - layered network has two kinds of links , i.e. those links in @xmath12 or @xmath13 and the others between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the former consists of the degree distributions @xmath73 and @xmath74 while the latter the interconnection network .",
    "we let @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 represent the average degrees of networks @xmath12 , @xmath13 and interconnection network @xmath14 , respectively . in details , we firstly generate two separated networks @xmath12 and @xmath13 with the same size @xmath75 and different degree distributions @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . then , we add links between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "that is , we randomly choose two nodes from @xmath12 and @xmath13 and then connect them if they are not connected yet .",

    "<S> this finding opens a new window for studying the recurrent epidemics in multi - layered networks .    </S>",
    "<S> epidemic spreading in complex networks has been well studied and a lot of great progress have been achieved such as the infinitesimal threshold @xcite , reaction - diffusion model @xcite , flow driven epidemic @xcite , and objective spreading etc @xcite , see the review refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the attention has been moved to the case of multilayer networks @xcite , which represent the interactions between different real - world networks such as critical infrastructure @xcite , transportation networks @xcite , living organisms @xcite , and social networks @xcite etc . </S>",
    "<S> these models enable us to determine how the interplay between network structures influences the dynamic processes taking place on them @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a pathogen spreads on a human contact network abetted by global and regional transportation networks @xcite . due to their ubiquitous applications in complex systems </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the understanding of the properties and dynamic processes in multilayered networks carries great practical significance .    </S>",
    "<S> two of the most successful models used to describe epidemic spreading are the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) and susceptible - infected - refractory ( sir ) models . </S>",
    "<S> mark _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ used the sir model to multilayered networks in 2012 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very interesting , they found a mixed phase in weakly coupled networks where an epidemic occurs in one network but does not spread to the coupled network . </S>",
    "<S> saumell - mendiola _ et al _ used the sis model to multilayered networks also in 2012 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , they found that such a mixing phase does nt exist in both analytic and simulation results . in their work , they mainly focused on the epidemic threshold and studied how epidemics spread from one network to another .    </S>",
    "<S> all these studies are focused on the growing aspect of a single epidemic outbreak , no matter it is one layer or multilayered networks . </S>",
    "<S> however , in realistic situations , the empirical data shows that epidemic is recurrent , i.e. with outbreaks from time to time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we recently extended the study to the case of recurrent epidemics @xcite , but limited only to a single network . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the interactions between different networks are ubiquitous , we here recheck several real data of coupled regions or cities such as the general out - patient clinics ( gopc ) network and its coupled general practitioners ( gp ) network of hong kong ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data](a ) and ( b ) ) , the coupled regional networks of california and nevada ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> 1(e ) and ( f ) in si ) . </S>",
    "<S> we interestingly find that their recurrent epidemics are closely related to each other . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the coupled time series of recurrent epidemics can show either synchronized outbreak phase where outbreaks occur simultaneously in both networks or mixed outbreak phase where outbreaks occur only in one network but do not in another one . </S>",
    "<S> this finding calls our great interest and motivates us to study its underlying mechanism . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , we believe that it is very necessary to further extend the study of recurrent epidemics to the case of multilayered networks .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we present a two - layered network model of coupled recurrent epidemics to reproduce the synchronized and mixed outbreak phases . to guarantee the appearance of recurrent outbreaks , we choose the susceptible - infected - refractory - susceptible ( sirs ) model for each node of network and </S>",
    "<S> let the infectious rate be time dependent , symbolizing the larger annual variation of environment . by this model </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the average degrees of both the intra- and inter - networks play key roles on the emergence of synchronized and mixed outbreak phases . </S>",
    "<S> the synchronized outbreak phase is preferred to be triggered in two coupled networks with the same average degree while the mixed outbreak phase is preferred for the case with different average degrees . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show that the increasing of coupling strength , i.e. either the inter - layer infection rate or inter - layer average degree , will prefer to suppress the mixed outbreak phase but enhance the synchronized outbreak phase . a theoretical analysis based on microscopic markov - chain approach </S>",
    "<S> is presented to explain the numerical results . </S>",
