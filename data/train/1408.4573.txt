    "transport properties of strongly interacting chiral fermions have become a subject of intense research in recent years .",
    "one of the fascinating features of chiral fermions is the existence of the so - called anomalous transport phenomena , which stem from quantum anomalies and are thus absent in classical systems @xcite .",
    "one of the well - known examples of such phenomena is the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) - the generation of electric current along the magnetic field in a system with different numbers of left- and right - handed chiral fermions @xcite .",
    "the interest to cme has been to a large extend stimulated by the possibility to observe it in non - central heavy - ion collisions , where the chirality imbalance might be created locally due to topological transitions in the produced quark - gluon plasma and the huge magnetic field with strength comparable to hadronic scale is created due to the relative motion of ions with large electric charge @xcite .",
    "the cme can also be realized in liquid helium , where its experimental manifestation is the helical instability @xcite .",
    "later on it has been realized that the cme could also be realized in weyl semimetals @xcite  a novel phase of matter in which low - energy excitations are described as weyl fermions , with left- and right - handed weyl points being separated either in momentum or in energy @xcite .",
    "the cme can be observed if the weyl points of different chiralities have different energies .",
    "it is a common statement that the transport coefficients which correspond to the cme as well as to other anomalous transport phenomena are universal and do not change when the interactions between fermions are switched on .",
    "this statement , however , relies on a number of nontrivial assumptions on the properties of the underlying quantum field theory , such as the existence of a fermi surface with well - defined quasiparticle excitations around it @xcite or the finiteness of the static screening length @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that both of these assumptions are violated when spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "first , the emergence of massless goldstone bosons leads to the infinite static screening length .",
    "second , the effective mass term generated due to spontaneous symmetry breaking invalidates the fermi liquid picture at finite chiral chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the chiral kinetic equations of @xcite to massive fermions was discussed recently in @xcite , however , this results are still valid only in the realm of the applicability of kinetic theory , that is , for weakly coupled dilute plasmas , for which one do not expect any spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "let us also mention that the asymptotic behavior of the chiral magnetic conductivity at high momenta can be related to a certain correlator of two vector and one axial current , which is not renormalized in massless qcd only if the chiral symmetry is not spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "while the universal value of the chiral magnetic conductivity can be formally derived from the low - energy chiral lagrangian @xcite , the role of the chiral chemical potential in this derivation is played by the time derivative of the axion field , which makes its interpretation in the euclidean finite - temperature path integral formalism quite unclear @xcite . in particular , it is not clear how to describe the stationary cme current as a response to static magnetic field in such a framework .",
    "since the derivation of @xcite relies on the qcd chiral lagrangian , it is also not directly applicable to weyl semimetals .    apart from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", anomalous transport coefficients can receive purely radiative corrections if the corresponding currents / charges are coupled to dynamical gauge fields @xcite . since in weyl",
    "semimetals the interactions are naturally associated with electric charges , one can expect that even perturbatively the cme current might receive some corrections .",
    "finally , since the chiral chemical potential itself is coupled to a non - conserved axial charge , it might also be subject to some non - trivial renormalization in interacting theories ( there are some subtle points in this statement which we address a bit later in this section ) .",
    "in this work we study spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a system of interacting dirac fermions with chiral imbalance , addressing in particular the renormalization of chiral chemical potential and the fate of the chiral magnetic effect in a phase with broken chiral symmetry . since we mostly keep in mind the application of our results to dirac quasiparticles in weyl semimetals , we consider a single flavour of dirac fermions with instantaneous on - site interactions between electric charges .",
    "however , since the consequences of the chiral symmetry breaking are to a large extent independent of the underlying interactions , we believe that our results should be also at least partly applicable to strongly interacting matter and quark - gluon plasma",
    ".    our main tool in this work will be the mean - field approximation which incorporates possible condensation of all fermionic bilinear operators .",
    "while this approximation might eventually break down at sufficiently strong coupling due to large fluctuations of fermionic condensates , we justify our approach by the fact that in most cases mean - field approximation correctly predicts possible patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the types of the phase transitions , while the exact position of the transition points might be incorrect . on the other hand , at weak coupling mean - field approximation",
    "simply reproduces an infinite chain of one - loop diagrams .",
    "the chiral imbalance in our study is implemented in terms of a nonzero chiral chemical potential @xmath0 coupled to the non - conserved axial charge @xmath1 . the term @xmath2 in the single - particle dirac hamiltonian shifts the energies of left- and right - handed weyl nodes to @xmath3 .",
    "we note that while chiral symmetry breaking for weyl semimetals with spatial momentum separation between the weyl nodes ( which corresponds to the term @xmath4 ) have been studied in details @xcite , to our knowledge the case of energy separation between weyl nodes has been previously considered only in the context of effective qcd models @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these works , here we will explore possible fermionic condensates more systematically , in particular taking into account the renormalization of the chiral chemical potential .",
    "we will also explicitly take into account the variation of fermionic condensates in external electromagnetic fields which probe the cme .",
    "it turns out that this more systematic treatment predicts the enhancement of cme due to interactions , in contrast to the dielectric screening found previously in @xcite .",
    "another difference of our study from the studies of qcd effective models is that the parameter which controls the breaking of chiral symmetry is the interaction strength rather than the temperature .    because of the non - conservation of the axial charge , the chiral chemical potential @xmath0 is not a chemical potential in the usual sense .",
    "for instance , its value might be renormalized due to interactions .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that in the presence of nonzero @xmath0 chiral fermions coupled to electromagnetism become unstable towards the formation of magnetic background with nontrivial chern - simons number ( also known as magnetic helicity in plasma physics ) , which effectively reduces the chiral chemical potential @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest that the fully self - consistent description of chirally imbalanced matter should be dynamical and should allow for spontaneous breaking of translational invariance .",
    "since such a dynamical description might be quite complicated beyond the kinetic theory / hydrodynamical approximation , here we partly neglect the coupling of fermions to dynamical electromagnetism and assume that there is a spatially homogeneous stationary ground state even in the presence of chiral imbalance .    in the case of weyl semimetals ,",
    "such an approximation might be justified by the fact that in condensed matter systems interactions with magnetic field are suppressed by a factor @xmath5 as compared to electrostatic interactions , where @xmath6 is the fermi velocity ( in units of the speed of light ) .",
    "since the decay of chiral imbalance necessarily involves the generation of magnetic fields , one can expect that the typical decay time will be enhanced by a factor of @xmath7 as compared to the time scales at which electrostatic interactions are important , and the stationary ground state might be a good approximation at such short time scales .",
    "another possible situation which can be described in terms of the ( quasi-)stationary ground state is when chirality is pumped into the system at a constant rate which compensates for its decay rate .",
    "experimental realization of such `` chirality pumping '' in parallel electric and magnetic fields have been recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main results of the present work are , first , the quick growth of the renormalized chiral chemical potential in a phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the corresponding phase transition itself turns into a crossover and is shifted to slightly smaller values of the interaction potential in the presence of chiral imbalance .",
    "second , we find that the cme is significantly enhanced due to interactions , both in the weak- and in the strong - coupling regimes .",
    "however , we do not find any discontinuity of the chiral magnetic conductivity across the phase transition .",
    "third , we find that in the strongly - coupled regime the cme current is saturated by the parity - even particle - antiparticle bound state of spin one ( or vector meson in qcd terminology ) . in the presence of chiral imbalance ,",
    "such states with orthogonal transverse polarizations are mixed with each other , thus giving rise to the parity - odd cme response .",
    "moreover , such vector - like bound states are mixed with pseudo - vector ones .",
    "finally , we comment on very different responses of dirac fermions to chiral imbalance in the context of condensed matter systems , where the number of states in the dirac sea is always finite , and in the context of quantum field theories which typically require some regularization of the vacuum energy .",
    "while in the former case the vacuum energy is always lowered by chiral imbalance , in the latter case the contribution of regulator fermions leads to the opposite effect .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] we introduce the model hamiltonian which we consider and by applying the hubbard - stratonovich transformation bring the corresponding partition function into the form suitable for the mean - field calculation .",
    "in section [ sec : phase_transition ] we study spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the presence of chiral imbalance by numerically minimizing the mean - field free energy . in section [ sec : cme ] we study the chiral magnetic effect within the linear response approximation and comment on the mixing between different particle - hole bound states at nonzero chiral chemical potential . in section [ sec : vacuum_energy ] we speculate on the role of chiral chemical potential in different regularizations or lattice implementations of dirac fermions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude with a general discussion of the obtained results and an outlook for future work .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the many - body hamiltonian of the following general form : @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the free and the interaction parts of the hamiltonian and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators at points @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which can be either points in continuous space or the sites of some lattice . correspondingly , the sum @xmath15 denotes either integration over continuous coordinates or summation over lattice sites . small greek letters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 label dirac spinor components .",
    "@xmath19 is the ( bare ) single - particle dirac hamiltonian , which again can be either the continuum dirac hamiltonian or some lattice hamiltonian which at low energies describes dirac fermions .",
    "the bare chiral chemical potential @xmath20 is introduced as a term of the form @xmath21 in the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the on - site interaction potential and @xmath24 is the charge operator at point @xmath13 .",
    "the subtraction of @xmath25 from the charge operator mimics the background charge of ions in any real crystalline lattice which can support dirac quasiparticle excitations .",
    "this addition , however , does not play any role in our calculation .",
    "while at the next stages of our calculations we will use the continuum dirac hamiltonian , for the derivation of the mean - field approximation which we present in this section it is more convenient to assume that @xmath13 and @xmath14 in ( [ hamiltonianinitial ] ) take discrete values .    in order to represent the partition function @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the temperature ) in the form suitable for mean - field calculations , we start with the suzuki - trotter decomposition @xmath29 where the euclidean time interval @xmath30 } $ ] is split into infinitely small intervals of size @xmath31 . the representation ( [ suzukitrotter ] ) is exact up to corrections of order of @xmath32 .",
    "the next step is to apply the hubbard - stratonovich transformation to the terms involving the interaction hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "since charge operators @xmath33 in @xmath10 commute at different points @xmath13 , we can write @xmath34 there are now several possibilities to perform the hubbard - stratonovich transformation on each of the factors on the right - hand side of ( [ interactionpointsplitting ] ) , corresponding to different grouping of four fermionic operators in ( [ interactionpointsplitting ] ) into two fermionic bilinears .",
    "if we were able to perform the integration over the hubbard field exactly , all these representations would be of course equivalent .",
    "however , the mean - field approach which we use in this work is the saddle - point approximation for the integral over the hubbard field , and the validity of this approximation might strongly depend on the choice of the integration variables .",
    "here we perform the hubbard - stratonovich transformation in a way which allows to treat the chiral condensate and also all other fermionic bilinear condensates as extrema of the corresponding effective action . to this end",
    "we first rewrite @xmath35 where from now on we shorten the notation by assuming summation over repeated spinor indices . inserting this representation of @xmath36 into ( [ interactionpointsplitting ] ) , we can separate the two summands in the second line of ( [ q2transform1 ] ) into two exponents , making an irrelevant error of order @xmath32 .",
    "then we transform the exponent containing the four fermionic operators into the exponent of a fermionic bilinear operator by representing it in terms of a gaussian integral over the hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath37 , which is a hermitian matrix in spinor space :    @xmath38    finally , we can again combine all the factors in the suzuki - trotter decomposition ( [ suzukitrotter ] ) into a single time - ordered exponent , neglecting the error of order of @xmath32 , which yields @xmath39    we thus have formulated the problem in terms of the fermionic partition function which corresponds to the effective time - dependent single - particle hamiltonian of the following form : @xmath40 with background field @xmath41 which depends on euclidean time @xmath42 .    in the mean - field approximation",
    ", we replace the integral over @xmath41 in ( [ hspartitionfunction ] ) by the value of the integrand at its minimum .",
    "if the minimum corresponds to some nonzero value of @xmath41 , one says that the fermionic condensate @xmath43 is formed .",
    "additionally , one can take into account the corrections by integrating over gaussian fluctuations around the saddle point , which are interpreted as propagating bound states of two fermions .    in order to find the minimum",
    ", we will assume that the invariance under shifts of euclidean time is not broken , and thus the value of the hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath44 at the minimum does not depend on @xmath42 .",
    "then the trace of the time - ordered exponent in the integrand in ( [ hspartitionfunction ] ) can be rewritten as simply the partition function of a free fermion gas with single - particle hamiltonian ( [ effectivesphamiltonian ] ) with @xmath42-independent @xmath37 : @xmath45 where the sum goes over all energy levels @xmath46 of this single - particle hamiltonian . in this work",
    "we will be interested in the limit of zero temperature . in this case all the summands in the second line of ( [ fermionictrace ] ) with @xmath47",
    "are zero , and all the terms with @xmath48 are equal to @xmath49 .",
    "we thus see that the fermionic contribution to the free energy @xmath50 is simply equal to the ( negative ) energy of the dirac sea , which is just the sum of all the energy levels below zero . combining this contribution with the quadratic action of the hubbard - stratonovich field ,",
    "we conclude that in the static mean - field approximation we have to minimize the following functional with respect to @xmath37 : @xmath51    before proceeding with the actual minimization of the above functional , let us consider the effective chemical potential term @xmath52 in the effective single - particle hamiltonian ( [ effectivesphamiltonian ] ) .",
    "its appearance might seem strange at the first sight , since it might induce nonzero electric charge in an initially electrically neutral system .",
    "however , the hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath37 also contains the constant component proportional to @xmath53 which can mimic the chemical potential .",
    "let us explicitly separate this term by writing @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "the functional ( [ mffunctional ] ) can be then written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the spatial size of the system and @xmath58 are the eigenvalues of the single - particle hamiltonian ( [ effectivesphamiltonian ] ) with @xmath37 replaced by @xmath59 and without the @xmath52 term . in order to find the mean - field value of @xmath60",
    ", we have to solve the equation @xmath61 , which can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the heaviside step function , which simply counts the number of energy levels @xmath64 below zero .",
    "one can show that for dirac hamiltonians with chiral chemical potential either in the continuum or on the lattice the energy levels @xmath58 are symmetric around zero , so that every positive energy level @xmath65 is accompanied by the negative energy level @xmath66 .",
    "the total number of energy levels is @xmath67 and is equal to the total number of degrees of freedom living on the lattice ( @xmath68-component dirac spinors on every lattice site ) .",
    "therefore there are @xmath69 energy levels @xmath58 below zero . taking this observation into account , it is easy to see that @xmath70 is the stable solution of the equation ( [ muminimization ] ) .",
    "we conclude therefore , that the effective mean - field chemical potential exactly compensates the term @xmath52 in ( [ effectivesphamiltonian ] ) . therefore we can simply discard this term and assume that the hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath37 is traceless on average : @xmath71 .",
    "in this section we study the phase diagram of our model by explicitly minimizing the free energy ( [ mffunctional ] ) . in what follows , we will use the continuum regularized dirac hamiltonian for the effective single - particle hamiltonian @xmath72 in ( [ effectivesphamiltonian ] ) : @xmath73 where @xmath6 is the fermi velocity , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are now the continuum coordinates , @xmath74 is the covariant derivative over @xmath13 which includes external gauge field @xmath75 and @xmath76 is some ultraviolet regularization of the delta - function @xmath77 , which very quickly decays if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are separated by the distance larger than the inverse uv cutoff scale @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 are the dirac @xmath16-matrices , @xmath80 is the generator of chiral rotations , @xmath81 are the dirac gamma - matrices , @xmath82 are the pauli matrices and @xmath83 is the @xmath84 identity matrix .",
    "we also suppress the spinor indices of the dirac matrices and @xmath37 for the sake of brevity .",
    "the main reason to use the continuum dirac operator in this exploratory study is to preserve exact chiral symmetry of the action .",
    "first of all , this makes our results potentially applicable to a wider range of physical systems , including also qcd .",
    "second , the mean - field calculations in the continuum approximation are much simpler and also more instructive . while for more realistic lattice dirac hamiltonians the chiral symmetry is always broken at high energies due to lattice artifacts , we expect that the continuum approximation which we make here nevertheless captures some features of the low - energy behavior of lattice models .",
    "preliminary studies with wilson - dirac hamiltonian , which will be published elsewhere , qualitatively confirm the predictions obtained in the continuum approximation .    in order to calculate the mean - field diagram for the effective single - particle hamiltonian ( [ continuumdirachamiltonian ] ) , we assume that external fields are absent and translational and rotational symmetries are not broken , so that @xmath85 is constant in space .",
    "moreover , lorentz symmetry allows only the following structure of fermionic condensates @xmath86 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the effective mass induced due spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath63 is the complex phase of the mass and @xmath0 is the renormalized chiral chemical potential .",
    "further we will see that the mean - field free energy does not depend on @xmath63 , which is thus the progenitor of a goldstone mode .",
    "it is easy to calculate the energy levels @xmath89 of the effective single - particle hamiltonian ( [ effectivesphamiltonian ] ) with such hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath90 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 is the factor which imposes uv cutoff and @xmath94 denotes the energy levels of unregularized continuum dirac hamiltonian . in what follows , we assume that the function @xmath95 is equal to one for @xmath96 and for @xmath97 it approaches zero very quickly , so that for sufficiently smooth integrands @xmath98 the integrals of the form @xmath99 can be written as @xmath100 . such uv regularization makes the energy of the dirac sea ( the first summand in the mean - field free energy ( [ mffunctional ] ) ) finite and mimics the finiteness of the dirac sea in more realistic lattice models , for which @xmath101 can be associated with inverse lattice spacing .    in continuum space the action of the hubbard field , which is the second part of the mean - field functional ( [ mffunctional ] ) , can be in general written as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is some constant which depends on the details of uv regularization .",
    "this formula can be obtained , e.g. , by taking the naive continuum limit in some lattice regularization .",
    "clearly , the only effect of the constant @xmath103 is some renormalization of the interaction potential @xmath23 .    inserting now the expressions ( [ muaenergylevels ] ) , ( [ condensatestructure ] ) and ( [ hsactioncontinuum ] ) into ( [ mffunctional ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the mean - field free energy which should be minimized with respect to the effective mass @xmath88 and the renormalized chiral chemical potential @xmath0 : @xmath104    in order to study spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , we perform numerical minimization of this functional . to this end",
    "we set @xmath105 and @xmath106 in what follows , thus expressing all other quantities in units of uv cutoff . instead of fixing the fermi velocity @xmath6 to some particular value , it is convenient to rescale the mean - field free energy as @xmath107 and express it in terms of the rescaled fermionic condensates and interaction potential @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to check that in terms of these new variables , the mean - field free energy ( [ mffunctionalpractical ] ) does not depend on @xmath6 : @xmath112 we thus see that after minimizing the above expression the dependence of the final results on the fermi velocity can be obtained by a simple rescaling .",
    "saddle point values of the effective mass @xmath88 and the renormalized chiral chemical potential @xmath0 are plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : mf_condensates ] as functions of the interaction potential @xmath23 for different values of the bare chiral chemical potential @xmath20 .",
    "if the chiral chemical potential is absent in the bare hamiltonian , we observe the standard picture of second - order quantum phase transition associated with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "namely , the effective mass is identically zero for @xmath113 and rapidly grows at @xmath114 .",
    "the chiral chemical potential is identically zero for all values of @xmath23 in this case .",
    "however , at nonzero bare chiral chemical potential",
    "@xmath20 the situation becomes more interesting .",
    "first , the second - order transition changes to some sort of crossover or an infinite - order phase transition already at very small values of @xmath20 , so that the effective mass @xmath115 still quickly rises for @xmath23 larger than some pseudo - critical value but does not show any discontinuity of derivatives .",
    "rather , @xmath115 very slowly approaches zero as @xmath23 goes to zero .",
    "the renormalized chiral chemical potential @xmath0 is very close to the bare value for @xmath116 but starts quickly growing at @xmath117 .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath118 also do not exhibit any discontinuities .",
    "as @xmath20 increases , the transition becomes more and more soft .",
    "+    the very slow monotonic growth of the effective mass @xmath115 at small @xmath23 is of course expectable , since finite particle - like and hole - like fermi surfaces at @xmath119 trigger cooper - type instability towards the formation of particle - hole bound states even at arbitrarily small inter - electron interaction potential @xmath23 .",
    "the effective mass in this case should have an essential singularity in @xmath23 of the form @xmath120 where the factor @xmath121 is proportional to the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the fermi momentum . ]",
    "( see e.g. chapter 6 of @xcite ) and @xmath124 , @xmath16 and @xmath125 are some constants . in order to check this essential singularity scaling of the effective mass , on fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_vs_v_logscale ] we plot the inverse logarithm of the effective mass @xmath126 rescaled by @xmath121 as a function of @xmath23 . due to finite precision of our numerical minimization procedure",
    "the effective mass @xmath88 contains large systematic numerical errors at sufficiently small @xmath23 , and for smaller @xmath20 the numerical errors typically set in at larger values of @xmath23 . for this reason",

    "these fits are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_vs_v_logscale ] with solid lines .",
    "we find that the results of numerical minimization are indeed well fitted by such functions , with the values of the parameters @xmath103 , @xmath124 and @xmath16 coinciding within the fitting uncertainty for all values of @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore conclude that due to cooper instability the second - order phase transition at @xmath128 turns into a crossover at @xmath129 , and the true chiral phase transition at which the effective mass @xmath88 becomes different from zero is shifted to @xmath130 . since in realistic lattice models the chiral symmetry is anyway broken by the nonlinearity of the lattice dispersion relation away from the dirac points and the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking might become quite different from the one in the continuum theory , we do not study here this crossover transition in more detail .",
    "let us only mention that recently we have performed a similar mean - field study of the phase diagram for wilson - dirac hamiltonian with chiral imbalance , where the chiral phase transition is replaced by the transition to the aoki phase with condensed pions @xcite .",
    "it turned out that in this case the order of the phase transition does not change in the presence of chiral imbalance , and there are no indications of cooper - type instabilities . otherwise , all the qualitative results of @xcite are similar to those obtained in the present paper .    for crossover transitions",
    "the usual way to define the observable - dependent critical interaction potential is to associate it with the inflection point of the approximate order parameter . from fig .",
    "[ fig : mf_condensates ] one can see that the critical coupling @xmath131 defined as the inflection point of the effective mass becomes smaller as the bare chiral chemical potential grows .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the results obtained from qcd - inspired effective models , for which the deconfinement temperature becomes lower at nonzero @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "let us also note that the inflection point of the derivative @xmath132 can be also used to define the `` critical '' interaction potential , which turns out to be slightly different from the critical value obtained from the inflection point of the effective mass , but also decreases for larger @xmath20 .",
    "this difference in the critical values of @xmath23 obtained from different observables also indicates that in the presence of chiral chemical potential spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is a crossover , at least in the mean - field approximation .",
    "we see that in contrast to the conventional chemical potential , which is not renormalized by virtue of conservation of electric charge ( see the discussion at the end of section  [ sec : hamiltonian ] ) , chiral chemical potential is effectively enhanced by interactions .",
    "a simple intuitive explanation of this observation is that the chiral imbalance , much like the dirac mass term , lowers the vacuum energy and is thus energetically favourable .",
    "we discuss this property in more details for both continuum and lattice dirac fermions in section [ sec : vacuum_energy ] .",
    "in this section we study how the chiral symmetry breaking discussed in the previous section [ sec : phase_transition ] affects the cme . here we consider cme as a stationary process , that is , a response of static , permanently flowing electric current to a static magnetic field . on the one hand",
    ", this approximation might be too idealistic to be realized in real physical systems , for which chirality pumping and the application of external magnetic field are always dynamical processes @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is probably the possibility to have charge transport in the ground state of the system which makes the idea of cme so attractive .",
    "thus we assume that such a stationary regime can be at least approached under the same assumptions under which the system of dirac fermions with chiral imbalance can be considered as a stationary state ( see the discussion in the introductory section [ sec : intro ] ) .    in the linear response approximation",
    ", one can characterize such a static cme response by the chiral magnetic conductivity @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the wave vector which describes the spatial modulation of sufficiently weak magnetic field which causes the cme . in order to match the hydrodynamical description of the chirally imbalanced plasma one",

    "our regularization preserves the invariance of the hamiltonian under chiral rotations . for free fermions",
    "such a regularization yields a finite answer @xmath229 @xcite .",
    "conservation of vector current can be restored by adding the bardeen counterterm @xmath230 to the bare action , which should lead to vanishing chiral magnetic conductivity in the limit of small momentum @xcite .",
    "the second variation of the bardeen counterterm over the gauge field @xmath231 has the same form as the anomalous current - current correlator which enters the kubo formula ( [ cme_kubo ] ) for the chiral magnetic conductivity .",

    ", we conclude that in order to calculate the anomalous correlator of conserved currents we simply have to subtract the term @xmath233 from @xmath228 .",

    "the reason is simply the contribution of the regulator fermions , which also feel the chiral chemical potential .",
    "our observations here suggest that there are two interpretations of the chiral chemical potential for a system of dirac fermions .",
    "one is valid for condensed - matter - style models , for which the dirac sea consists of a finite number of levels with real fermions occupying them .",
    "this is the case for our regularization [ continuumdirachamiltonian ] , the wilson - dirac hamiltonian ( [ wdham ] ) , the corresponding wilson - dirac operator ( [ wdop ] ) and the overlap dirac hamiltonian ( [ ovham ] ) . in this case",
    "the vacuum energy is always lowered in the presence of chiral imbalance .",
    "another interpretation might be more relevant for relativistic quantum field theories with chiral fermions",
    ". in this case one has to subtract the infinite contribution of the dirac sea in the energy density by using either finite or infinite number of regulator fermions .",
    "after this subtraction the contribution of regulator fermions leads to the increase of the vacuum energy in the presence of chiral imbalance .",
    "of course , one can expect that if we switch to this another interpretation of the chiral chemical potential , the results presented in this work might change .",
    "in this work we have reported on a mean - field study of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry for dirac fermions with chiral imbalance and contact interactions between charges . our main conclusion is the enhancement of the renormalized chiral chemical potential and the chiral magnetic conductivity due to interactions .",
    "this enhancement is found both in the weak - coupling perturbative regime and in the strongly - coupled phase with broken chiral symmetry .",
    "we believe that this effect is a combination of both perturbative radiative corrections and non - perturbative effects associated with spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "perturbative corrections to anomalous transport coefficients are in general allowed if the corresponding currents are coupled to dynamical gauge fields @xcite , which are in our case mimicked by the contact interactions between electric charges . as discussed in section  [ sec : cme ] , our mean - field analysis in fact corresponds to summation of an infinite number of chain - like diagrams . at the level of the single - particle dirac hamiltonian",
    "another possible source of corrections to the cme current is the renormalization of the fermi velocity , which is not taken into account in this work .",
    "non - perturbative corrections due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking can be expected since the appearance of the massless goldstone modes and the effective mass term in general invalidate the assumptions underlying the proofs of the non - renormalization of anomalous transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "another argument is that the chiral magnetic conductivity can be related to a certain correlator of two vector and one axial currents , which is not renormalized in massless qcd but can get nontrivial non - perturbative corrections in a phase with broken chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the enhancement of the chiral magnetic conductivity can not be explained by the enhancement of the chiral imbalance alone .",
    "we also note that a somewhat similar study has been previously reported in @xcite , where dielectric screening , rather than the enhancement , of the chiral magnetic conductivity was found .",
    "we note , however , that the mean - field analysis of @xcite did not systematically take into account all possible channels of fermion condensation in the presence of external magnetic field .",
    "in particular , the renormalization of the chiral chemical potential was not taken into account .",
    "we also find that even at the smallest values of the bare chiral chemical potential @xmath20 the transition to the phase with broken chiral symmetry turns into a soft crossover due to cooper - type instability at small interaction strength .",
    "this crossover becomes softer and softer as @xmath20 is increased .",
    "let us note that while all our conclusions rely on the assumption of spatially homogeneous fermionic condensates ( in the absence of external magnetic fields ) , holographic studies in the sakai - sugimoto model suggest that for sufficiently large bare chiral chemical potential @xmath20 the true ground state is not homogeneous @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to find whether the corresponding inhomogeneous ground state also exists in our lattice model , which we leave for the further work .",
    "let us note , however , that direct numerical analysis of the hessian matrix @xmath286 of the mean - field free energy ( [ mffunctional ] ) in the vicinity of the homogeneous condensate configuration shows that the homogeneous condensate is at least a local minimum - that is , there are no flat or unstable directions in the space of inhomogeneous condensates @xmath188 near @xmath287 which would allow for immediate decay into a non - homogeneous condensate .",
    "our analysis indicates also that in the strongly coupled regime the cme current is saturated by vector - like bound particle - hole bound states ( vector mesons ) with mixed transverse polarizations . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "the cme current in the phase with broken chiral symmetry was derived from the contact terms in the low - energy chiral lagrangian .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the contribution of vector mesons found in our work corresponds somehow to these contact terms in the low - energy effective action or it should be additionally taken into account",
    ".    our study should be most relevant for condensed matter systems with dirac or weyl fermions as low - energy excitations . as discussed in section  [ sec : vacuum_energy ] , for relativistic quantum field theories with chiral imbalance there is a certain regularization ambiguity , which might potentially change our conclusions .",
    "however , we believe that for instance the mixing of transverse vector mesons in the presence of chiral imbalance should also be present in qcd , irrespective of whether chiral symmetry breaking is enhanced or suppressed by chiral chemical potential",
    ".    the author would like to thank g.  dunne , t.  kalaydzhyan , d.  kharzeev and a.  sadofyev for interesting discussions which stimulated this work , and to b.  roy and the anonymous referee for their remarks on cooper - type instability .",
    "this work is supported by the s.  kowalewskaja award from the alexander von humboldt foundation .",
    "in the mean - field approximation one replaces the free energy @xmath288 by the value of the action @xmath289 at the saddle point @xmath290 of the corresponding path integral over some bosonic field @xmath291 .",
    "we have also assumed that the action depends on some external fields @xmath292 . for the sake of brevity , in this appendix we use condensed index notation , so that the indices @xmath124 and @xmath267 of the field variables include both spatial coordinates and also any internal indices of the fields @xmath90 and @xmath293 .",
    "we also assume summation over repeated indices .    the linear response of the observables @xmath294 to the perturbations of the external fields @xmath292",
    "is given by the second derivative @xmath295 .",
    "in this appendix we calculate this derivative in the mean - field approximation , replacing @xmath296 with @xmath289 .",
    "since the saddle - point equation @xmath297 in general depends on the external fields @xmath292 , the saddle - point value of @xmath291 is also a function of @xmath292 : @xmath298 .",
    "therefore when the free energy @xmath296 is replaced by the saddle - point action @xmath299 , one also has to replace the partial derivatives @xmath300 with the variation @xmath301 then one can write for the second derivative of the free energy over the external fields : @xmath302 where we have omitted the arguments of the action @xmath303 and of the saddle - point field @xmath304 for the sake of brevity . due to the identity @xmath305",
    ", there is no term with the second derivative @xmath306 in the above equation .",
    "the derivative of the saddle - point field @xmath290 over @xmath293 can be calculated by differentiating the saddle - point equation ( [ apdx_sp_equation ] ) over @xmath293 : @xmath307 it is now convenient to define the propagator @xmath308 of the field @xmath291 through the identity @xmath309 so that the equation ( [ apdx_impl_der1 ] ) can be written as @xmath310 inserting this equation into ( [ apdx_action_2nd_der ] ) and using ( [ apdx_impl_der ] ) once again , we finally arrive at the desired result : @xmath311",
    "in this appendix we give the details of the calculation of the operator @xmath312 , where @xmath176 given by ( [ s_def ] ) is the fermionic contribution to the mean - field free energy ( [ mffunctional ] ) .",
    "our starting point are the expressions ( [ s_2nd_var ] ) and ( [ continuumhamiltonianderivative ] ) .",
    "the wave functions @xmath313 which correspond to the energy levels @xmath89 are @xmath314 where @xmath315 is the weyl spinor which is the normalized eigenstate of the operator @xmath316 with eigenvalue @xmath317 : @xmath318 .",
    "we note also that the energy levels @xmath94 which enter the spinor part @xmath319 of the wave functions ( [ apdx_muawavefunctions ] ) are the energy levels ( [ muaenergylevels ] ) of the unregularized dirac hamiltonian .",
    "we begin with the calculation of the contribution of the second summand on the r.h.s . of ( [ s_2nd_var ] ) to @xmath210 , which we denote as @xmath321 , and later consider the first contribution ( denoted as @xmath322 ) associated with energy levels crossing zero .        where @xmath324 , @xmath325 and the `` loop momentum '' variable @xmath326 was introduced in order to satisfy the constraints of momentum conservation @xmath327 . in order to impose the constraint @xmath48 in ( [ s_2nd_var ] ) ,",
    "we set @xmath328 , thus excluding this index from summations in the above expression .    remembering that the regulating factor @xmath329 is equal to one for @xmath330 and is very small for @xmath331 , it is easy to see that due to a specific combination of @xmath332 and @xmath333 the integrand of ( [ apdx_sigma2_explicit ] ) vanishes if @xmath334 or @xmath335 . correspondingly , in a region with @xmath330 and @xmath336 one can simply replace these factors by unity , which significantly simplifies the calculations .",
    "in particular , it is convenient to perform an explicit summation over @xmath337 and @xmath338 using the identity      where @xmath340 is the fourier - transformed effective single - particle hamiltonian ( [ continuumdirachamiltonian ] ) without the regulating factor , the first matrix factor in the last line has chiral indices @xmath57 , @xmath157 and @xmath341 is the projection operator in the spin space which projects the spin on the direction of momentum @xmath342 with sign @xmath338 .",
    "similar identity can be also obtained for the second line of ( [ apdx_sigma2_explicit ] ) upon the replacement @xmath343 .",
    "now it is convenient to completely factor out the chiral and the spin indices into direct products and to rewrite the equation ( [ apdx_sigma2_explicit ] ) as @xmath344    where we have introduced the following short - hand notations in order to make the expressions more compact : @xmath345 @xmath346 when defining the energies @xmath347 , @xmath348 and the chiral wave functions @xmath349 and @xmath350 we have explicitly taken into account that @xmath328 . by expressing the integrand of ( [ apdx_sigma2_dirprods ] ) in terms of the rescaled variables @xmath109 , @xmath108 ( see eq .",
    "( [ mffunctionalrescaled ] ) in section  [ sec : phase_transition ] ) and correspondingly @xmath351 , @xmath352 one can completely eliminate the fermi velocity in the integrand of ( [ apdx_sigma2_dirprods ] ) .",
    "it only appears as an overall factor of @xmath353 in front of ( [ apdx_sigma2_dirprods ] ) .",
    "thus in order to calculate @xmath210 at some @xmath235 , one should simply substitute the rescaled variables @xmath354 and @xmath355 into the expression obtained with @xmath239 , and multiply the result by @xmath353 .",
    "the above representation of @xmath356 is especially convenient for both analytic transformations and numerical calculations .",
    "first , we see that the traces over the `` chiral '' and the `` spin '' indices completely factorize in the integrand of ( [ apdx_sigma2_dirprods ] )",
    ". explicit calculation of the `` chiral '' part ( the trace which involves @xmath159 and @xmath357 ) shows that the integrand is only nonzero if @xmath358 ( diagonal terms ) or if @xmath359 , @xmath360 and vice versa or @xmath361 and @xmath362 and vice versa ( off - diagonal terms ) . assuming that the momentum @xmath134 is parallel to the @xmath363rd coordinate axis , @xmath136",
    ", one can also see that the `` spin '' part is only nonzero if @xmath364 ( diagonal terms ) or if @xmath365 , @xmath366 and vice versa or if @xmath367 , @xmath368 and vice versa .",
    "some of the off - diagonal terms become zero only after integrating out the loop momentum .",
    "the appearance of these off - diagonal terms both in the `` chiral '' and the  spin  parts of the self - energy of the hubbard - stratonovich field implies an interesting picture of mixing between different particle - hole bound states ( `` mesons '' in the language of qcd ) of different spin / parity and polarizations in the presence of parity - breaking chiral chemical potential @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss this picture in more details in the section  [ sec : cme ] of the main text .",
    "after explicitly calculating the integrand of ( [ apdx_sigma2_dirprods ] ) , we rewrite the integral over the loop momentum @xmath369 in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath370 .",
    "it is important that the integration region specified by @xmath330 , @xmath336 is also cylindrically symmetric around the @xmath363rd coordinate axis .",
    "integration over @xmath371 can be then performed analytically and additionally removes many terms in the integrand .",
    "we are then left with the integral over @xmath372 and @xmath373 , which can be performed analytically at zero mass @xcite . at nonzero mass , this is no longer possible and we use the ` cubature ` ` c ` package @xcite to calculate the integral .",
    "let us now turn to the second contribution to @xmath187 , which is associated with the energy levels which cross zero in external field .",
    "this contribution comes from the first summand on the r.h.s . of ( [ s_2nd_var ] ) .",
    "we denote it as @xmath374 .",
    "first we note that obviously this contribution is only nonzero if the effective mass @xmath88 is zero and there is no gap in the spectrum .",
    "if the spectrum has finite gap , infinitely small perturbations can not move any energy level down to zero .",
    "thus we should consider only the phase with unbroken chiral symmetry .",
    "inserting the explicit form of the eigenstates ( [ apdx_muawavefunctions ] ) into ( [ s_2nd_var ] ) and performing the fourier transform ( [ apdx_energy_expansion_momentum ] ) , one can immediately see that @xmath375 contribution is proportional to the delta - function at zero momentum : @xmath376 . moreover , it is only nonzero for @xmath377 and @xmath378 and @xmath379 .",
    "this delta - function singularity will result in the usual `` ballistic '' contribution to the transport coefficients and will not affect the anomalous transport .",
    "therefore we disregard it in this work ."
