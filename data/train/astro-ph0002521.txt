    "determining the value of hubble s constant , h@xmath6 , has been a challenge to astronomers since the discovery of the universal expansion in 1927 .",
    "it is sometimes argued that we are now at the fine tuning stage and many measurements give values for h@xmath6 which lie between the hotly argued values of 50kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 ( sandage ) and 100kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 ( de vaucouleurs ) , e.g. calculated h@xmath6=67@xmath8kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 . however , many of these measurements are based on secondary indicator methods which in turn are dependent on the accuracy of primary indicators of distance such as the cepheid period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation .",
    "the well - studied lmc p - l relation is usually calibrated via the distance modulus to the lmc and the previously accepted value was around 18.50 . however ,",
    "this has been recently challenged in a paper by who determined the distance modulus to the lmc as 18.70@xmath9 .",
    "this small difference in the distance modulus causes a 10@xmath10 decrease in estimates of the hubble s constant .",
    "this discrepancy has further motivated us to check the galactic zeropoint of the p - l relation .",
    "we do this by checking the values of the distance modulus and reddening of the 11 galactic clusters that contain cepheids via zero age main sequence fitting ( zams ) ."
