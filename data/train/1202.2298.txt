    "the characteristics of ultracold bosonic two - body scattering processes provide a key ingredient for modeling and understanding of the properties of degenerate atomic gases .",
    "the dominant s - wave interactions of the two - body collisions can be conveniently modeled by huang - fermi s pseudopotential @xcite . over the last decade",
    ", this pseudopotential has become an essential theoretical tool in particular for analytical studies of ultracold systems , e.g. , see busch et .",
    "@xcite for two atoms in harmonic traps , olshanii for atomic collisions in cylindrical waveguides @xcite , where the so - called confinement - induced resonances ( cirs ) was predicted and experimentally observed in @xcite , or in refs .",
    "@xcite which employed approaches based on the energy dependent scattering lengths , @xmath0 .",
    "the theory of pseudopotentials has been developed further in order to describe scattering processes involving higher - partial waves , i.e. , with relative angular momentum @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "higher - partial wave interactions represent an intriguing perspective in research on ultracold gases and are expected to provide novel many - body phenomena , such as unconventional superfluidity and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "so far , theoretical studies with pseudopotentials for @xmath2 have mainly been used to describe fermionic systems , e.g. , in quasi - one - dimensional @xcite or quasi - two - dimensional @xcite geometries , which have been studied experimentally in @xcite . for the case of bosons",
    "an analytical description of collisions in a planar waveguide has been derived , where the cross - section possesses s- and d - wave resonances @xcite . in harmonic waveguides",
    "higher - partial wave interactions were shown to have important impact on bosonic scattering @xcite through the interference of d - wave resonances ( dwrs ) with the underlying continuum .",
    "a theoretical treatment of d - wave scattering of bosons in the case of quasi-1d geometries is , however , still needed .    in this work",
    "we derive an approximative analytical solution for bosonic collisions in a harmonic waveguide , which goes beyond mere s - wave scattering .",
    "our starting - point is to assume that the transversal confinement frequency is weak enough in order to avoid a strong interference between the free space d - wave shape resonance and the s - wave scattering .",
    "the latter permits to model the interatomic potential through a zero - range regularized d - wave pseudopotential suggested in @xcite , which is parametrized by a single parameter , the energy dependent d - wave scattering length ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the associated regularization operator contains exclusively derivatives .",
    "taking into account the virtual excitations occurring during the scattering process we analytically describe the appearance of the dwr .",
    "an important aspect of our approximative formula for the d - wave scattering amplitude is that one can map the total hamiltonian onto an effective one - dimensional hamiltonian , where the interaction is modeled by a one - dimensional contact potential .",
    "the strength of the contact potential depends on the above - mentioned d - wave scattering amplitude , similar to the case of the s - wave cir @xcite .    in order to verify the validity of the approximative analytical results we compare them with corresponding numerical calculations , where the interatomic interaction is modeled by a lennard - jones potential .",
    "a good agreement is obtained only for a sufficiently weak confinement . for strong confinement",
    "the pseudopotential does not capture the s- and d - wave interference and therefore lacks the description of the numerically obtained fano asymmetric lineshape of the transmission coefficient @xcite .",
    "the sectioning of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the recent developments of pseudopotential theory for higher partial wave interactions . in sec .",
    "iii we describe and discuss the d - wave scattering process .",
    "iv contains a comparison of the analytical results and the numerical calculations and sec .",
    "v provides a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "the pseudopotential approximation to the interatomic interaction is an ubiquitous tool for the theoretical description of ultracold gases : the atomic interactions are modeled in terms of a contact potential .",
    "huang and yang @xcite derived a generalized pseudopotential for all partial waves , which represents a multipolar expansion over delta function contributions .",
    "the huang - yang approach ( hy ) was revised by derevianko @xcite , who corrected an algebraic error for @xmath2 .",
    "however , other derivations have been developed for higher partial wave pseudopotentials , which differ from the hy - approach , by using a more rigorous treatment of the derivatives of the delta - functions in the framework of distribution theory @xcite yielding the following representation :    @xmath4 ^ 2}{4\\pi(2\\ell)!\\ell!}g_{\\ell}\\frac{\\delta^{(\\ell)}(r)}{r^2}\\\\ & \\times\\left[\\dfrac{\\partial^{2\\ell+1}}{\\partial { r'}^{2\\ell+1 } } { r'}^{\\ell+1 } \\int d \\mathbf{\\omega ' } p_{\\ell } ( \\hat{\\mathbf{r } } \\cdotp \\hat{\\mathbf{r } } ' ) \\psi(\\mathbf r')\\right]_{\\mathbf{r'}=0 } , \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 , with @xmath6 defined as the @xmath7-th energy - dependent scattering length @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath8 is the @xmath7-th derivative of the delta function and the integral over the solid angle @xmath9 acts as a projection operator of the total wavefunction on each @xmath10state . for @xmath11 one obtains from eq.([1 ] ) the huang - fermi pseudopotential .",
    "however , the eq.([1 ] ) for @xmath2 differs by a factor @xmath12 from huang and yang s result @xcite , whereas if we substitute in eq.([1 ] ) the relations @xmath13 and @xmath14 we obtain the pseudopotential of derevianko @xcite .    additionally , stampfer and wagner @xcite introduce the following pseudopotential for higher partial waves :    @xmath15_{\\mathbf{r'}=0 } , \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the operator @xmath16 , introduced by maxwell @xcite , is obtained from the spherical harmonic polynomial @xmath17 , by replacing the cartesian coordinates @xmath18 with the partial derivatives @xmath19 .",
    "note that eq.([2 ] ) is equal to eq.([1 ] ) as it was proven in @xcite by using the relation    @xmath20    the above - mentioned pseudopotentials can be simplified @xcite in order to describe interactions of a single partial wave character .",
    "this simplification is based on the fact that in general the atomic interaction is dominated by the @xmath7-partial wave scattering in the vicinity of the corresponding @xmath7-partial wave resonance .",
    "thus , one can focus on a single partial wave , which yields the following pseudopotential :    @xmath21_{\\mathbf{r'}=0}. \\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    furthermore , the sum w.r.t .",
    "@xmath22 can be simplified with the help of the following summation formula :    @xmath23 } c_{k}\\left(\\bm{\\nabla } \\cdot \\bm{\\nabla } ' \\right)^{\\ell-2k } \\nabla^{2k } ( \\nabla ' ) ^{2k } , \\label{5}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 $ ] is the largest , smaller or equal integer of @xmath25 and @xmath26/\\left[2^{\\ell}k!(\\ell - k)!(\\ell-2k)!\\right]$ ] are the coefficients of the legendre polynomials @xmath27}c_{k}x^{\\ell-2k}$ ] .",
    "eqs.([4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) constitute pseudopotentials for any @xmath7-partial wave .",
    "these pseudopotentials are expressed in terms of differential operators which are more convenient in analytical derivations than the pseudopotential with the projection operator ( see eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) ) .",
    "in the following we consider ultracold collisions of identical bosons in the presence of an external harmonic confinement . the scattering process is taking place in the low energy regime , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the relative momentum in the unconfined degree of freedom and @xmath30 is the oscillator length defined via the trap frequency @xmath31 and the reduced mass @xmath32 of the colliding bosonic pair .",
    "furthermore , in order to go beyond s - wave physics we assume that the momentum @xmath29 is very small but not equal to zero . consequently",
    ", as it was shown in @xcite except for the well known s - wave cir @xcite , an additional resonance emerges in this system , the so - called dwr , which is based on the interference of a free space d - wave shape resonance with s - wave scattering .",
    "the coexistence of s- and d - wave resonances implies interactions between the bosons of s- and d - wave symmetries ( see fig.1(c ) in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present an analytical model for the dwr effect in a harmonic waveguide .",
    "however , the modeling of s- and d - wave interactions with pseudopotentials in systems of non - spherical symmetry , as the above - mentioned one , is not a trivial task . as the symmetry of the system is cylindrical",
    "the angular momentum is not conserved and consequently , the application of pseudopotentials , eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , leads to an explicit integration over all @xmath7-partial waves .",
    "though , as it was proposed in @xcite one can avoid such difficulties by considering a single @xmath7-partial wave in the vicinity of the @xmath7-wave resonance , where contributions from other partial waves are sufficiently suppressed .",
    "the latter means that in the vicinity of the s - wave resonance , we assume that the interaction can be modeled by the following pseudopotential with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) :    @xmath33 , \\label{6}\\ ] ]    which is the huang - fermi pseudopotential , with the s - wave scattering length @xmath34 being energy dependent .",
    "note that eq.([6 ] ) coincides with the pseudopotential proposed in @xcite .",
    "equivalently , in the vicinity of the d - wave resonance , we assume that the interaction can be modeled by the following pseudopotential @xcite :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 with the indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the energy dependent d - wave scattering length . the bidirectional operator , @xmath39 @xmath40 denotes the differential operator in cartesian coordinates , that acts to the left ( right ) of the pseudopotential @xmath41 .",
    "we emphasize that application of the expressions ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) simultaneously is inconsistent and incompatible since the pseudopotentials @xmath42 and @xmath41 are valid for the cases where the wavefunction exhibits only @xmath43- or @xmath44- singularities for small @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we assume two - body collisions of identical bosons in a waveguide with their transversal degrees of freedom being confined by a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the harmonic confinement permits the separation of the center of mass and relative motion yielding a single - particle hamiltonian with a scatterer fixed at the origin for the relative degree of freedom .    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the relative coordinate of the two bosons , and @xmath48 is the pseudopotential which models the arbitrary @xmath7-wave inter - atomic interaction .",
    "the symmetry of the transversal potential , @xmath49 , implies that the scattering solutions should be expanded in an axially symmetric basis .",
    "such a basis set are the eigenstates of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) harmonic oscillator which satisfy the schrdinger equation    @xmath50\\tilde{\\varphi}_{n , m_z}(\\rho,\\phi)\\\\ = e_{n , m_{z}}\\tilde{\\varphi}_{n , m_z}(\\rho,\\phi ) , \\normalsize{\\label{9}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 are the eigenfunctions of the 2d harmonic oscillator , @xmath52 is the azimuthal quantum number and @xmath53 is the transversal energy spectrum of the 2d harmonic oscillator , with @xmath54 being the principal quantum number .",
    "the spherical symmetry imprinted by the pseudopotential , @xmath48 , leads to a separation of the azimuthal @xmath55 angle from the @xmath56 , @xmath57 coordinates in eq.([9 ] ) .",
    "the latter means that during the collision no virtual excitations will occur with respect to the @xmath52 quantum number .",
    "however , virtual excitations will emerge with respect to the principal quantum number @xmath58 , which will be taken into account in the calculation given below .",
    "we focus on the single mode regime , where the collision takes place in the ground state of the transversal confinement with angular momentum @xmath59 and represents the only `` open channel '' .",
    "the latter means that the total energy of the pair collision is limited between the ground and the first axially symmetric transversal state    @xmath60    furthermore , the above - mentioned independence on the angle @xmath55 results in the following simplified schrdinger equation :    @xmath61\\psi(z,\\rho)\\\\ = e \\psi(z,\\rho ) , \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 is the total colliding energy , which is defined as the sum of the longitudinal kinetic energy @xmath63 and the energy of the transverse ground state @xmath64 . due to the constraint of eq.([10 ] ) the momentum @xmath29 is limited according to the relation @xmath65 . here , @xmath66 denotes the full 2d axially symmetric solution , which can be expanded in the @xmath67 basis    @xmath68    where we sum over all even @xmath58 due to the bosonic symmetry .    substituting eq.([12 ] ) into eq.([11 ] ) , multiplying by @xmath69 , integrating and using eq.([9 ] ) yields the following equation for the functions @xmath70 :      by solving eq.([13 ] ) for @xmath72 we obtain the scattering wavefunction @xmath73 in the open channel which has the following asymptotic form :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the one - dimensional scattering amplitude of the @xmath7-wave interaction which describe the even scattered waves .    for @xmath76 , eq.([13 ] ) provides us with the solution for the virtual excitations associated with the closed channels , which decay exponentially according to the relation    @xmath77    where the coefficients @xmath78 refer to the @xmath7-wave interaction and denote the transition amplitudes from the transverse ground state to the @xmath58-th excited state .    in the case of the d - wave pseudopotential we substitute eq.([14 ] ) into eq.([13 ] ) for @xmath72 and eq.([15 ] ) into eq.([13 ] ) for @xmath76 and integrate over the @xmath56 variable , respectively , in the interval @xmath79 $ ] with @xmath80 .",
    "finally , we obtain the following relations for the d - wave scattering and transition amplitudes :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the regularized part of the wavefunction @xmath83 in the limit @xmath84 ,    @xmath85\\bigg\\ } \\bigg| _ { z \\rightarrow0^+ } , \\label{18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath57 given by the relation @xmath86 .",
    "then the expression for the wavefunction reads    @xmath87\\varphi_{0}(\\rho)\\\\ + \\frac{a_{d}^5(k ) \\sqrt{\\pi}}{48a_{\\perp}^2}\\eta_d \\lambda_1(z,\\rho ) , \\label{19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath88 is defined as follows :    @xmath89    let us now to proceed with the explicit definition of the regular part @xmath82 of the wavefunction , being a solution of eq.([18 ] ) .",
    "the action of the operator @xmath90 on @xmath91 for @xmath92 results in the following relation :    @xmath93 -\\frac{a_{d}^5(k)}{24a_{\\perp}^5}\\eta_d \\lambda_2(z,\\rho=0 ) , \\label{21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 reads : @xmath95    here , we should note that the @xmath96-series at @xmath97 are not converging uniformly as @xmath98 .",
    "the latter means that the partial derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath56-coordinate can not be interchanged with the sum over all even @xmath58 .",
    "thus , firstly one has to perform the summation and then differentiate with respect to the @xmath56 coordinate .",
    "however , with the help of euler s summation formula @xcite one can express the @xmath96-series as an expansion with respect to the @xmath56 variable , where the singular part of the @xmath96-series will be written in closed form yielding the following expressions :    @xmath99    where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are constants calculated via euler s summation formula .",
    "consequently , by substituting eqs.([19])-([24 ] ) into eq.([18 ] ) we obtain @xmath82 , which is now free of divergences .",
    "this in turn yields the following expression for the one - dimensional scattering amplitude :    @xmath104    where the constant @xmath105 is defined by the relation @xmath106 .",
    "the resonance condition for @xmath107 then reads    @xmath108{10b_2}. \\label{26}\\ ] ]    eq.([25 ] ) shows that the d - wave scattering in the presence of the waveguide becomes resonant at an off - resonant value of the free space @xmath3 scattering length , due to the significant contributions of the virtual excitations .",
    "the latter holds equally for the case of s - wave cir .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that in general the appearance of resonances in systems with transversal confinement are generated by the virtual excitations in the transverse modes .    by applying the s - wave pseudopotential , given in eq.([6 ] ) , and performing the derivation as mentioned above , we will obtain the same relation for the one - dimensional scattering amplitude as in @xcite with the difference that in this case the s - wave scattering length is energy dependent @xcite :    @xmath109    the constant @xmath110 in eq.([27 ] ) is equal to @xmath111 .",
    "in this section we compare the analytical results of the previous subsection for the s- and d - wave pseudopotentials with the corresponding numerical simulations .",
    "first we evaluate the d- and s - wave energy dependent scattering lengths by solving numerically a model of cs atoms in free space interacting via a lennard - jones potential , @xmath112 .",
    "note that cs atoms are ideal canditate for studing scattering phenomena , since they provide a rich spectrum of resonances @xcite .",
    "the dispersion coefficient @xmath113 has been taken from @xcite and @xmath114 is a free parameter , which controls the values for the s- and d - wave scattering lengths .",
    "this yields a parametrization of the one - dimensional s- and d - wave scattering amplitudes , eqs.([27 ] ) and ( [ 25 ] ) , respectively , in terms of @xmath114 .    in order to numerically solve the cs - cs collisions in the harmonic waveguide",
    "we employ the units @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the mass of the cs atom and @xmath117 mhz .",
    "the longitudinal energy is set to @xmath118 and the transversal energy is varied within the interval @xmath119 , corresponding to a range @xmath120 for the waveguide confinement frequency .",
    "we thereby focus on the low energy regime , characterized by @xmath121 . in the following",
    "we calculate the transmission coefficient given by : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the one - dimensional scattering amplitude for the @xmath7-wave .    , which shows the dwr on the l.h.s and the s - wave cir on the r.h.s .. the analytically calculated ( b ) s - wave transmission coefficient , @xmath124 , and ( c ) d - wave transmission coefficient , @xmath125 .",

    "[ fig1](a ) refers to the s - wave cir and the minimum on the l.h.s . to the dwr . due to the centrifugal barrier",
    "the width of the dwr is much narrower than that of the s - wave cir .",
    "additionally , we observe that both resonances yield a lorentzian - like lineshape in the transmission spectrum .",
    "this occurs due to the fact that the weak confinement suppresses the interference effects between the s - wave and d - wave interactions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) the analytically calculated transmission coefficient @xmath124 , as given by eqs.([27 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) , is shown which refers to s - wave interactions only .",
    "@xmath124 describes very accurately the s - wave cir ( see fig .",

    "the yellow dashed line in the right panels indicates the minimum of the numerical calculated transmission coefficient ( @xmath129 ) in comparison with the corresponding analytical result . ]",
    "let us now determine the regime of validity of the approximative analytical results for the d - wave pseudopotential scattering by comparing it with the corresponding numerical simulations . in fig .",

    "[ fig2](a ) for a strong confinement , e.g. @xmath132 , we first observe that the numerically calculated position of the resonance deviates substantially from the analytical one .",
    "however , as @xmath130 decreases the numerical results for the position of the dwr converges to the corresponding analytical one .",
    "the origin of this behavior is the fact that we considered only d - wave interactions in the analytical calculations and neglected contributions from the s - wave interactions .",
    "this approximation is eligible in the regime of a weak confinement , e.g. @xmath133 , where the s- and d - wave free space resonances are weakly coupled , and in the vicinity of the dwr the d - wave interactions are dominant over the s - wave . in the regime of strong confinement the transmission spectrum @xmath131 , in the vicinity of the dwr , exhibits a strong asymmetric fano - lineshape , with @xmath128 changing abruptly from zero to one .",
    "the latter is an interference effect of the strong s- and d - wave interactions in the confinement and can not be described by this analytical pure d - wave model .",
    "however , this asymmetric profile gets suppressed with decreasing @xmath130 yielding a lorentzian - like lineshape .",

    "these quantitative deviations again occur due to s - wave interactions , which act as corrections in the transmission coefficient @xmath128 despite of the weak coupling of the s - wave and d - wave interactions .",
    "we have derived and analyzed analytical expressions for resonant d - wave scattering in a harmonic waveguide , in the framework of pseudopotential theory .",
    "the interatomic interaction has been modeled by a pure d - wave pseudopotential introduced in @xcite .",
    "we observe that the analytical pseudopotential approach provides results which are in qualitative agreement with the corresponding numerical results in the regime of weak confinement due to the very small interference effects of s- and d - wave interactions.the appearance of the dwr in a waveguide is strongly affected by the virtual excitations over all the closed excited modes of the transversal confinement . for",
    "a strong transversal confinement the analytically and numerically calculated lineshape and position of the dwr deviate from each other .",
    "the interference effect of the s- and d - wave free space resonances in the confinement yields an asymmetric fano profile which can not be derived by a single partial wave model .",
    "our analytical result eq.([25 ] ) for weak confinement can be used for the analysis of resonant scattering processes in confined geometries beyond s - wave physics .",
    "finally , we remark that our work clearly demonstrates the necessity of an extended pseudopotential theory capable of describing systems which possess a non - spherical symmetry that yield interference phenomena between different partial wave scattering amplitudes .",
