    "entanglement is one of the most striking properties of quantum mechanics .",
    "it describes a correlation between quantum mechanical systems that does not occur in classical mechanics , namely that a pure state of a composite quantum system can not be written as a product of the states of its constituents @xcite .",
    "it has long been a subject of interest in foundations of quantum mechanics , but recently it has acquired a fundamental role in quantum computation and quantum information @xcite .",
    "several attempts to quantify entanglement have been developed @xcite , but this is an area of research still in progress . in the case of a pure state of a bipartite system , a good and widely accepted measure of entanglement is the von neumann entropy of its reduced density matrix .",
    "this entropy can be associated with a quantity called concurrence @xcite , which we adopt here as our measure of entanglement .",
    "the concurrence varies from 0 to 1 , the larger it is the more entangled is the state .",
    "spin chains are ideal systems for the study of entanglement .",
    "they are naturally used to model quantum computers ( qc s ) : the two states of a spin-1/2 particle correspond to the two levels of a qubit and the exchange interaction corresponds to the qubit - qubit interaction .",
    "a particle with spin up corresponds to an excitation or an excited qubit .",
    "we consider a spin chain described by the @xmath0 model .",
    "this is the model used in quantum computers based on electrons on helium @xcite .",
    "the ising part of the interaction is proportional to the anisotropy coupling , as shown in the next section .",
    "it only plays a role when two or more excitations are present in the chain .",
    "the xy part of the interaction is responsible for hopping the excitations and can be used to create entanglement between two or more qubits @xcite .",
    "however it can also quickly destroy bipartite entanglement , because the excitations soon spread all over the chain .    a way to avoid the spreading ( or delocalization ) of the excitations",
    "is by tuning the qubits away from resonance @xcite .",
    "such control of the qubit level spacings enables us to entangle just some specific qubits .",
    "this is the strategy we use in this paper . to have two chosen qubits maximally",
    "entangled , we tune them in resonance .",
    "their level spacings are different from all other qubits , they are the defects of the chain .",
    "when there is only one excitation in the chain , the entanglement between the two selected sites becomes trivial . by assuming that the energy difference between the defects and the ordinary qubits is much larger than the strength of the @xmath1 interaction , the hamiltonian of the system gives two maximally entangled states .",
    "they correspond to superpositions of the basis states where the excitation occupies one of the defects @xcite .",
    "however , when more than one excitation is present , the entanglement between the defects can be significantly affected by the ising interaction . the main purpose of the present work is to analyze which is , in this case , the eigenstate with maximum concurrence and how the value of the maximum concurrence depends on the anisotropy .",
    "we find numerically that for large values of the anisotropy coupling , nearest neighbor defects are strongly entangled and the value of the concurrence is almost negligibly affected by the number of excitations in the system . in the case of separated defects ,",
    "this observation is valid only for long chains . in the opposite situation of small anisotropies ,",
    "the concurrence between the defects is strongly dependent on the number of excitations and it can become quite small .",
    "partial analytical justifications for these observations are provided .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the model and the adopted measure for bipartite entanglement . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the maximum concurrence between nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor defects for various values of the anisotropy coupling . a discussion on how to prepare maximally entangled states and how the anisotropy may help is also presented in this section .",
    "we consider a spin chain with nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system is given by the @xmath0 model    @xmath2 , \\\\   & & h_{\\rm{hop } } = \\left(\\sigma _ { n}^{+ }   \\sigma _ { n+1}^{- } + \\sigma _ { n}^{- } \\sigma _ { n+1}^{+ }   \\right )   \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are pauli matrices .",
    "there are @xmath5 sites and we deal with a periodic ( or closed ) chain , that is , sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the same . each site @xmath7 is subjected to a magnetic field in the @xmath8 direction , giving the energy splitting @xmath9 . in this description ,",
    "the excitation energy of a qubit is the zeeman energy of a spin . in this disordered chain ,",
    "not all the qubits have the same level spacing @xmath10 .",
    "the energy of two qubits , called defects , differs from those of other qubits by @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is the hopping integral and @xmath13 is a dimensionless parameter related to the anisotropy coupling .",
    "the diagonal term @xmath14 gives the ising interaction and the non - diagonal term @xmath15 is responsible for propagating the excitations .",
    "we set @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the anisotropy in the hamiltonian ( [ xxz ] ) is different from the one considered in some previous models @xcite .",
    "the hopping part of the hamiltonian can be equivalently written as @xmath18 .",
    "here @xmath19 , but in the models cited above , the degree of anisotropy comes from the difference between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the anisotropy in our case originates from the extra ising interaction . in terms of entanglement ,",
    "few studies have been developed with this model @xcite .",
    "moreover , our goal is not simply to analyze how entanglement may depend on the described anisotropy , but we aim to analyze how it is affected by the interplay between this interaction and disorder .",
    "the disorder of the system we consider is characterized by the presence of the two defects . in principle , total control of the qubit level spacings is available , which allows the creation of defects .",
    "the ising part of the @xmath0 model combined with defects has been used before to create maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "the study of entanglement with impurities , but without any @xmath22 interaction , has also been done in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize the importance of studying the effects of this extra interaction in disordered systems , which are far from trivial .",
    "the ising interaction is only relevant when at least two excitations are present , being therefore associated with many - body problems .",
    "it is actually at the heart of one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter physics , namely the difficulty in localizing many - particle states @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we count energy off the ground state energy @xmath23 , i.e. , we replace in eq .",
    "( [ xxz ] ) @xmath24 .    to address the different states of the system we use a notation that is common in the study of spin chains with the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the state corresponding to one single excitation on site @xmath7 , that is @xmath25 , or equivalently @xmath26 , is simply written as @xmath27 .",
    "the state of two excitations , one on site @xmath7 and the other one on site @xmath28 , is @xmath29 , which is a simplified notation for @xmath30 , or equivalently @xmath31 .",
    "basis states where each excitation is confined to a single site , such as @xmath32 , are called in quantum computing quantum registers .",
    "these are the states where the measurements are performed .    since we want to study the effects of the ising interaction , several excitations have to be considered , which limits the numerical analysis to small chains .",
    "in the model described by eq .",
    "( [ xxz ] ) , the @xmath8 component of the total spin @xmath33 is conserved , so states with different number of excitations are not coupled and the hamiltonian is made of uncoupled blocks .",

    "the block corresponding to @xmath34 excitations has dimension @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "its diagonalization leads to eigenstates which correspond to linear superpositions of quantum registers @xmath36 with @xmath34 excitations .",

    "the difference in energy between them and the other qubits , @xmath11 , is assumed much larger than the hopping integral , @xmath56 .",
    "this guarantees that an excitation placed on one defect can only hop between the two defect sites . as a consequence , among all the eigenstates of the system , the ones with a single excitation shared between the defects have the largest concurrences .    in the first subsection below",
    ", we analyze the case where the defects correspond to two nearest neighbor qubits and in the second subsection they are two next nearest neighbors . since the chain has periodic boundary conditions , any pair of qubits @xmath57 translated through the chain is equivalent , so we choose , for the numerical calculations , the pair 1 and 2 as nearest neighbor defects and the pair 1 and 3 as next - nearest neighbor defects .",
    "we study how the maximum concurrence between the defects depend on the anisotropy and which is the corresponding eigenstate .",

    "there are two possible channels for the second order coupling between distant bound pairs and the @xmath11-band states .",
    "a possibility is a transition from sites @xmath142 to @xmath143 , but we can equivalently hop from @xmath142 to the bound pair next to the defect @xmath138 [ two channels also exist for the excitations on sites @xmath144 . the amplitudes for these two transitions",
    "are equal in magnitude , but opposite in sign . due to such quantum interference , or antiresonance",
    ", we have two uncoupled bands of very close energy .    the antiresonance explains why the drop in the value of the maximum concurrence when @xmath133 is not so drastic as one might have expected .",
    "also , since there are only four states preventing the creation of a perfect bell state , the decay of @xmath58 becomes less perceptible in larger chains .      when @xmath145 , the allowed transitions , shown below , now have two registers out of the core that could lead to a bell - type state .",
    "@xmath146 this justifies why the maximum concurrence never goes back to 1 , even for very large @xmath147 .",
    "however , the effects caused by just these two isolated registers , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , become less significant in larger chains .      when more than two excitations are present , the analysis of the maximum concurrence for small @xmath147 s gets more complicated .",
    "a more interesting and general situation emerges when @xmath145 . here",

    "these states have one excitation hopping between the two defects and all the others bound together in a cluster in sites far from the defects .",
    "only clusters with the same number of excitations are coupled and the transitions between them happen in a high order of perturbation theory in @xmath12 .",

    "they are shown in the figure with dot - dashed ( maroon ) lines , but can hardly been seen.,width=240 ]      the description of the dependence of the maximum concurrence on the anisotropy coupling when the defects are next nearest neighbors is very complex , especially when several excitations are present .",
    "just like in the end of the previous subsection , we restrict our study to the case of @xmath145 , where general remarks can be made .",
    "the states with the largest concurrences are similar to the states given by eq.([bell2 ] ) .",
    "they have one excitation hopping between the two defects , though they are now separated , so the transition occurs in second order in @xmath12 .",
    "the other excitations are bound together in clusters placed at least two sites away from the defects .",
    "compared to the case of nearest neighbor defects , these remaining @xmath156 excitations have now one site less available , there are @xmath192 sites for them .    when @xmath156 is larger than @xmath192 , the states with the largest concurrence have a different form .",
    "sometimes these states can also have large concurrences , but this is not always the case , which explains the curves with low concurrence in the top and middle panels in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    .",
    "the panels correspond to data for chains of different lengths : @xmath63 ( top ) , @xmath64 ( middle ) and @xmath65 ( bottom ) .",
    "the maximum number of excitations considered for each chain is @xmath66 .",
    "the curves are chosen as follows : solid ( black ) curves for 2 excitations , dotted ( red ) for 3 excitations , dashed ( blue ) for 4 excitations , long dashed ( green ) for 5 excitations , and dot - dashed ( violet ) for 6 excitations.,width=240 ]    the important result of this section is the verification that bell - type states can again be obtained in the limit of large chains and @xmath193 , even though the defects are separated .",
    "an analysis for the time evolution of the system with a particular @xmath11-band quantum register taken as the initial state could again be made .",
    "it would be very similar to the one from the previous subsection , though a longer time is required for a maximally entangled state to appear .",
    "we have shown how the interplay between interaction and disorder may affect the entanglement between two defects in a chain of qubits with anisotropic coupling .",
    "when the difference in energy between the defects and the ordinary qubits @xmath11 is much larger than the hopping integral @xmath12 , several situations may be identified according to the value of the anisotropy coupling @xmath13 , the number of excitations in the chain , where the defects are placed , and the chain size .",
    "the most general case refers to large chains and @xmath194 , where bell - type states are obtained even for defects that are not nearest neighbors .",
    "these states have one excitation hopping between the two defects and all the others bound together in a cluster far from the defect sites .",
    "these clusters are a consequence of the large anisotropy .",
    "they move together and very slowly , allowing the maintenance of a large entanglement between the defects for a long time .    in the case of nearest neighbor defects",
    ", we also verify that even when the anisotropy coupling is not very large , the decrease in the value of entanglement between the defects is never very abrupt and it becomes less significant in larger chains .",
    "analytical results were obtained for two excitations when @xmath195 and @xmath110 . for @xmath110",
    "the state with the largest concurrence is the one with the smallest energy in its band .",
    "we note that in this paper we have not developed any analysis in terms of quantum phase transition as done in several previous works @xcite . by selecting two very large defects we guarantee that the entanglement between them is mostly kept very large . if only the @xmath196 part of the hamiltonian ( [ xxz ] ) was present , i. e. if @xmath197 , their concurrence would always have the maximum value 1 , as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is the effect of the extra ising interaction that can sometimes decrease the entanglement .",
    "the present work has its clear relevance for quantum information and quantum computing , but it should also be of interest for condensed matter physics , where one wants to understand how localization may be affected by interaction and disorder .",
