    "one of the powerful predictions of the renormalization group theory of critical phenomena is universality according to which the critical behavior of a system is determined by : ( 1 ) symmetry group of the hamiltonian , ( 2 ) spatial dimensionality @xmath0 and ( 3 ) whether or not the interactions are short - ranged @xcite .",
    "the possibility of phase transitions on systems with nonintegral dimensionality @xmath0 was first considered by dhar @xcite for the classical xy - model and for the fortuin - kasteleyn cluster model on the truncated tetrahedron lattice with the effective dimensionality 2@xmath23/@xmath25=1.365 . no phase transition at any finite temperature",
    "was obtained .",
    "subsequently in a series of papers gefen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite examined the critical properties of the ising model ( discrete @xmath4 symmetry ) on fractal structures , which are scale invariant but not translationally invariant , in order to elucidate the relative importance of multiple topological factors affecting critical phenomena .",
    "they found that the ising systems with given fractal dimension @xmath5 have transition temperature @xmath60 if the minimum order of ramification @xmath7 , which is the minimum number of bonds that needs to be cut in order to isolate an _ arbitrarily large _ bounded cluster of sites , is finite . in the case of fractals with @xmath8",
    "they presented arguments that @xmath90 for the ising model .",
    "monceau and hsiao @xcite further studied the ising model on fractals with @xmath8 using the monte carlo method and found weak universality in that the critical exponents depended also on topological features of fractal structures .    for the models with continuous @xmath10 symmetry , @xmath112 , on fractal structures gefen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a correspondence between the low - temperature properties of such models and pure resistor network connecting the sites of the fractal to argue that there is no long - range order at any finite temperature if the fractal dimension @xmath122 even in the case of infinite order of ramification .",
    "subsequently vallat _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the harmonic approximation to the xy - model ( @xmath13 symmetry ) on two - dimensional sierpi ' nski gasket ( @xmath7=3 , @xmath13/@xmath22=1.585 ) to show that the energy of a vortex excitation is always finite and hence there is no berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition @xcite at any finite temperature as free vortices are always present .",
    "these conclusions were confirmed in a recent monte carlo study of the full xy - model on two - dimensional sierpi ' nski gasket @xcite .",
    "here we present a monte carlo study of the xy - model on three - dimensional sierpi ' nski pyramids with @xmath7=4 and fractal dimension @xmath14/@xmath22=2 .",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where 0@xmath152@xmath16 is the angle / phase variable on site @xmath17 , @xmath18 denotes the nearest neighbors and @xmath190 is the coupling constant . in the case of translationally invariant system in two dimensions this hamiltonian gives rise to bkt transition and we investigate if the same holds in the case of a fractal structure with fractal dimension @xmath202 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our algorithm for generating sierpi ' nski pyramids and outline the monte carlo procedure for calculating the thermal averages .",
    "section 3 contains our results and discussion and in section 4 we give a summary .",
    "the procedure which we used to generate three - dimensional sierpi ' nski pyramids ( sp ) is illustrated in figure 1 , which shows the transition from the zeroth - order sp ( the tetrahedron of unit side ) to the first order pyramid via translations by three nonorthogonal basis vectors @xmath21=(1,0,0 ) , @xmath22=(0,1,0 ) and @xmath23=(0,0,1 ) .",
    "the pyramid of order @xmath24 + 1 is obtained from the pyramid of order @xmath24 via translations by vectors 2@xmath25 , 2@xmath26 and 2@xmath27 ( @xmath24=0,1 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "it is clear that the number of vertices @xmath29 of the @xmath24th order sierpi ' nski pyramid can be obtained from the recursion relation @xmath29=4@xmath30 - 6 with @xmath31=4 .",
    "thus , in generating the pyramid of order @xmath24 + 1 from the pyramid of order @xmath24 not every point of the @xmath24th order pyramid gets translated by _ all _ three translation vectors 2@xmath25 , 2@xmath26 and 2@xmath27 .",
    "the top of the @xmath24th order pyramid , ( 0,0,0 ) , is never translated .",
    "the remaining @xmath29 - 1 points are then all translated by 2@xmath25 .",
    "next , the same points except for ( 2@xmath32,0,0 ) are translated by 2@xmath26 and finally , all points except for ( 2@xmath32,0,0 ) and ( 0,2@xmath32,0 ) are translated by 2@xmath27 . for pyramids of order @xmath339",
    "we found it most efficient to represent a vertex @xmath34 by the number @xmath3510@xmath36+@xmath3710@xmath38+@xmath3910@xmath40 and the three translation vectors 2@xmath25 , 2@xmath26 and 2@xmath27 by the numbers @xmath412@xmath4210@xmath36 , @xmath432@xmath4210@xmath38 and @xmath442@xmath4210@xmath40 , respectively .",
    "then the result of translating a point represented by number p by a vector represented by @xmath45 is described by the number @xmath46 . from a given number @xmath47 representing a vertex it is easy to get its coordinates @xmath34 in the basis @xmath48 : @xmath49/10@xmath50 $ ] , where @xmath51 $ ] denotes the integer part , @xmath5210@xmath5310@xmath54 $ ] and @xmath5510@xmath5610@xmath38 .    in the metropolis monte carlo scheme of calculating the statistical averages for a model with only the nearest neighbor interactions",
    "it is necessary to provide the list of nearest neighbors for each site / vertex .",
    "we take that all sites that are at a unit distance ( the size of the edge of the elementary tetrahedron ) from a given vertex are its nearest neighbors .",
    "thus the number of nearest neighbors of site @xmath34 varies with the order @xmath24 of sierpi ' nski pyramid .",
    "for example , the vertex ( 1,1,0 ) has six nearest neighbors in the first order pyramid ( figure 1 ) but the same site has eight nearest neighbors in all higher order pyramids , the additional two neighbors being vertices ( 2,1,0 ) and ( 1,2,0 ) . for the sierpi ' nski pyramids of orders",
    "@xmath574,5,6 we found the average number of neighbors per site to be 6.923 , 6.981 , 6.995 with standard deviations 0.903 , 0.876 , 0.869 , respectively .",
    "thus , the average coordination number for three - dimensional sierpi ' nski pyramid is greater than the coordination number for three - dimensional simple cubic lattice .",
    "this fact should be kept in mind when we discuss our numerical results in the next section . in constructing the list of nearest neighbors for the sites in a pyramid we found it convenient to group all sites according to the values of the sum @xmath58 of their coordinates ( i , j , k ) .",
    "the sites with the same @xmath58 belong to the same plane parallel to the basal plane of the pyramid defined by points ( 2@xmath32,0,0 ) , ( 0,2@xmath32,0 ) , ( 0,0,2@xmath32 ) , where @xmath24 is the order of the pyramid ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the nearest neighbors of a given site are located in the plane to which it belongs and in the neighboring planes . throughout this work we employed two types of boundary conditions : closed , where the four corners of an @xmath24th order pyramid were considered to be coupled to each other and open , where the four corners are uncoupled to each other .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the classical xy - model on sierpi ' nski pyramids was based on metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "we considered the pyramids of orders @xmath574 ( 130 sites ) , @xmath575 ( 514 sites ) and @xmath576 ( 2050 sites ) . for a pyramid of given order",
    "the simulation would start at a low temperature with all phases aligned .",
    "the first 120,000 steps per site ( sps ) were discarded , followed by seven mc links of 120,000 mc sps each . at each temperature",
    "the range over which each angle @xmath59 was allowed to vary @xcite was adjusted to ensure an mc acceptance rate of about 50% .",
    "the errors were calculated by breaking up each link into six blocks of 20,000 sps , then calculating the average values for each of 42 blocks and finally taking the standard deviation @xmath60 of these 42 average values as an estimate of the error .",
    "the final configuration of the angles at a given temperature was used as a starting configuration for the next higher temperature .",
    "the heat capacity per site shown in figure 2 was calculated from the fluctuation theorem @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath63 is the absolute temperature and @xmath64 denotes the mc average .",
    "the results did not depend on the type of boundary condition ( closed or open ) within the error bars in analogy to what was found for two - dimensional sierpi ' nski gasket @xcite . in the same figure",
    "we also show the results for heat capacity obtained for the xy - model on three cubic lattices with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the sizes of cubic lattices were chosen so that they are comparable to the sizes of three sierpi ' nski pyramids .",
    "the peak in the specific heat of cubic lattices near @xmath65=2.2 increases with system size @xcite as a consequence of diverging correlation length at a continuous ( i.e. second order ) phase transition . on the other hand",
    "the specific heat for the sierpi ' nski pyramids is virtually size - independent indicating the absence of long range order for the xy - model on three - dimensional sierpi ' nski pyramid at any finite temperature .",
    "thus , although the average coordination number for the sierpi ' nski pyramid ( @xmath3 7 ) is higher than its value for the cubic lattice , the topological properties of this fractal structure , in particular a finite order of ramification @xcite , are responsible for the lack of long range order at finite @xmath63 .",
    "the regular lattices have an infinite order of ramification as the number of bonds one needs to break in order to isolate an _",
    "arbitrary large _ bounded cluster of lattice sites is infinite . for fractals with a finite order of ramification",
    "an arbitrarily large bounded cluster can be cut off from the rest of the structure by breaking off only a finite number of bonds and at finite temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to destroy the long range order .",
    "the absence of size dependence of the peak in @xmath66 is found for the xy - model in two dimensions @xcite . in that case the peak results from unbinding of vortex clusters @xcite with increasing temperature above the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition temperature @xmath67 where the heat capacity has an unobservable essential singularity @xcite .",
    "however the results in figure 2 for fractal structures of fractal dimension @xmath202 do not necessarily imply bkt transition since size - independent peaks in @xmath66 could result from the average energy per site @xmath68 changing monotonically from the values near -3.5@xmath69 ( each site has about 7 neighbors on average ) at low temperatures to near zero in high temperature paramagnetic phase .",
    "the main signature of bkt transition is a universal jump in helicity modulus @xmath70=2/@xmath16 @xcite at critical temperature @xmath67 .",
    "the helicity modulus @xmath71 measures the stiffness of the angles @xmath72 with respect to a twist at the boundary of the system . at zero temperature ,",
    "when the angles are all aligned , one expects a finite value of @xmath73 and at high temperatures , when the system is in disordered paramagnetic phase , @xmath73 vanishes . for the xy - model on three - dimensional regular lattices",
    "@xmath71 decreases continuously with increasing temperature and just below the transition temperature @xmath67 it obeys a power law @xmath74 @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "however , there is a discontinuity in @xmath73 stemming from unbinding of the vortex - antivortex pairs at bkt transition from quasi - long - range order ( order parameter correlation function decays algebraically ) to disordered phase ( order parameter correlation function decays exponentially ) . in numerical simulations on finite systems discontinuity",
    "is replaced by continuous drop in @xmath71 which becomes steeper with increasing system size ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we should point out that since sierpi ' nski pyramid is three - dimensional object topological defects are not only vortices in planes parallel to the faces of the pyramid ( which are two - dimensional sierpi ' nski gaskets ) but also vortex strings . kohring",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented monte carlo evidence that a continuous phase transition for the xy - model in three dimensions is related to unbinding of vortex strings .",
    "we computed the helicity modulus for sierpi ' nski pyramids following the procedure of ebner and stroud @xcite .",
    "the idea is to think of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) as describing a set josephson coupled superconducting grains in zero magnetic field , where @xmath59 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter on grain @xmath17 . then if a _ uniform _ vector potential @xmath75 is applied the phase difference @xmath76 in ( [ ham ] ) is shifted by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the position vector of site @xmath17 and @xmath79 is the flux quantum .",
    "the helicity modulus is obtained from the helmholtz free energy @xmath80 as @xmath81 , i.e.   @xmath82 we took @xmath75 to be along one of the edges of elementary tetrahedron ( figure 1 ) .",
    "our results for @xmath71 obtained with closed boundary condition are shown in figure 3 .",
    "they are completely analogous to what was obtained for two - dimensional sierpi ' nski gaskets",
    "@xcite : a rapid downturn in @xmath71 starts near the universal 2/@xmath16-line but the low temperature values of @xmath71 decrease with increasing system size and the onset of the downturn , which is in the vicinity of the putative phase transition , shifts to the lower temperatures . for the xy - model on the square lattices , where bkt transition does occur ,",
    "the low-@xmath63 values of helicity modulus and the onset of its downturn do not depend on the system size ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "our results in figure 3 suggest that in thermodynamic limit @xmath83 @xmath71 vanishes at any temperature @xmath840 implying no bkt transition for the xy - model on sierpi ' nski pyramid of fractal dimension @xmath202 .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by our results for @xmath71 obtained with the open boundary condition when four corners of an @xmath24th order pyramid are not coupled to each other , figure 4 .",
    "the helicity modulus is zero within the error bars which are larger than those obtained with the closed boundary condition .",
    "the results in figures 3 and 4 indicate that closed boundary condition introduces additional correlations as was the case for two - dimensional sierpi ' nski gaskets @xcite .",
    "our conclusion about the lack of finite temperature bkt transition is supported by results for linear susceptibility @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the magnetization of the system , shown in figure 5 .",
    "for finite cubic lattices one gets a peak in @xmath87 near @xmath882.2 whose size and sharpness increase with the number of sites as a result of diverging correlation length at the onset of long range order . in the case of sierpi ' nski pyramids the peak in @xmath87 also grows with increasing system size but it also shifts substantially to lower temperatures . for",
    "bkt transition kosterlitz predicted @xcite that above @xmath67 the susceptibility diverges as @xmath89 $ ] , with @xmath90=0.25 , @xmath911.5 and @xmath92=0.5 , and is infinite below @xmath67 .",
    "our results suggest that in thermodynamic limit @xmath83 there would be no divergence in @xmath87 at any finite temperature for the classical xy - model on sierpi ' nski pyramid .",
    "from our monte carlo simulation results we conclude that there is no finite temperature phase transition for the classical xy - model ( @xmath13 symmetry ) on three - dimensional sierpi ' nski pyramid ( fractal dimension @xmath5=2 ) .",
    "since the heat capacity per site does not depend on the system size there can be no long range order at any finite temperature . because the low - temperature helicity modulus decreases with increasing system size for closed boundary condition , and is zero within the error bars for open boundary condition , it must vanish in thermodynamic limit at any finite temperature .",
    "this implies no continuous finite temperature phase transition associated with unbinding of vortex strings @xcite in which case the helicity modulus vanishes at transition temperature @xmath67 as a power law @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "moreover there is no finite temperature berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition associated with unbinding of vortices and characterized by discontinuity in @xmath71 at @xmath67 .",
    "these conclusions are supported by our results for linear magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the lack of finite - temperature long range order and the vanishing of spin stiffness / helicity modulus are the consequence of finite order of ramification of sierpi ' nski pyramid : as an arbitrarily large bounded cluster of sites can be disconnected by cutting only the finite number of bonds thermal fluctuations drive helicity modulus to zero and destroy long range order .",
