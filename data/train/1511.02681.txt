    "elastic - perfectly plastic models belong among fundamental nonlinear models which are useful for estimation of yield strengths or failure zones in bodies caused by applied forces .",
    "such models are mostly quasistatic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to catch the unloading phenomenon .",
    "since we are only interested in monotone loading processes , this phenomenon can be neglected and the class of models based on the deformation theory of plasticity is adequate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hencky model associated with the von mises yield criterion belongs to this class as well as other models with different yield conditions .",
    "each model from this class leads to a static problem for a given load functional @xmath7 representing the work of surface or volume forces .",
    "the problem can be formulated both in terms of stresses or displacements .",
    "these two approaches generate a couple of mutually dual problems .",
    "the variational problem formulated in terms of stresses leads to minimization of a strictly convex , quadratic functional on the set of statically and plastically admissible stress fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the stored energy functional appearing in the variational problem for displacements has only a linear growth at infinity with respect to the strain tensor or some components of this tensor .",
    "existence of a finite limit load reflects specifics of this class of problems . unlike other problems in continuum mechanics with superlinear growth of energy , exceeding of the limit load",
    "leads to absence of a solution satisfying the equilibrium equations and constitutive relations .",
    "physically this means that under this load the body can not exists as a consolidated object .",
    "therefore , finding limit loads is an important problem in the theory of elasto ",
    "plastic materials and other close problems .",
    "the limit load has the form @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is a nonnegative scalar parameter .",
    "in particular , no solution exists for the load @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "if we use the static approach to the limit load analysis then @xmath1 is defined as the largest value of @xmath11 for which there exists a statically and simultaneously plastically admissible stress field .",
    "the value @xmath1 is generally unknown and its finding is an important question in analysis of elasto - plastic structures .    from the above mentioned facts ,",
    "it is natural to consider the set @xmath12 of loads and parametrize the problem in this way . besides @xmath1",
    ", one can detect other interesting thresholds on the loading path that represent global material response , namely , @xmath13 - the end of elasticity and @xmath14 - the limit of proportionality . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the response is purely elastic ( linear ) and for @xmath16 $ ] , the response is strongly nonlinear .",
    "there are two possibilities how to evaluate @xmath1 : ( a ) compute @xmath1 directly and ( b ) find a suitable adaptive strategy that enlarges @xmath17 and detects the unknown value @xmath1 .",
    "in the first group of methods , the problem of finding the limit load is reduced to a special variational problem in terms of displacements ( kinematic approach ) , which involves an isoperimetric condition @xmath18 .",
    "for example , the respective problem of limit analysis for the classical hencky model with the von mises condition reads as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a subspace of @xmath21 of functions vanishing on the dirichlet part of the boundary ( see notation of section [ sec_setting ] ) .",
    "however , this problem is not simple for numerical analysis because it is related to a nondifferentiable functional and contains the divergence free constraint .",
    "the respective numerical approaches developed to overcome these difficulties often use saddle point formulations with augmented lagrangians ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other methods use techniques developed for minimization of nondifferentiable functionals .",
    "engineering computations often use rather straightforward incremental approach based on solving the displacement problem for a sequence @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "however , this may be costly without a suitable adaptive strategy for the increment @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , since the problems are solved numerically on a finite dimensional subspace , it is difficult to reliably verify that @xmath25 exceeds @xmath1 .    solving the problem for a fixed value of @xmath17 in terms of stresses leads to a variational problem , which is very difficult from the computational point of view since it requires an approximation of equilibrated stress fields which satisfy the plasticity condition in the pointwise sense .",
    "therefore , numerical approaches are usually applied to variational formulations in terms of displacements in spite of the fact that these problems are more complicated from the theoretical point of view because the basic variational problem may have no solution in a standard sobolev space .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest a different incremental technique which is based on transforming the problem into a dual form . instead of @xmath17",
    ", we use another parameter @xmath26 that is dual to @xmath17 and such that @xmath27 ( i.e. @xmath28 from the left ) as @xmath29 . for a given value of @xmath2",
    ", we derive a minimization problem for the stored strain energy functional subject to the constraint @xmath30 whose solutions define a unique way the respective value @xmath31 . using this approach , it is possible to find a loading path associated with the given load @xmath7 which provides a valuable information about @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 was originally introduced in @xcite for a discrete version of the hencky problem using the formulation of the problem in terms of displacements ( primal problem ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to generalize this idea to the continuous setting .",
    "this generalization however is not straightforward owing to the fact that the primal formulation is not well - posed on classical sobolev spaces .",
    "therefore the dual formulation of the problem will be used for finding the mutual relation between @xmath17 and @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_setting ] , we introduce basic notation , define elasto - plastic problems , and recall some results concerning properties of solutions . in section [ sec_parameters ] , the loading parameters @xmath17 and @xmath2 are introduced .",
    "then the function @xmath32 is constructed and its properties are established . in section [ sec_problems_alpha ] ,",
    "we formulate problems in terms of stresses and displacements related to a prescribed value of @xmath2 .",
    "section [ sec_discretization ] is devoted to standard finite element discretizations of the problems and to convergence analysis .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_eval ] , we present two examples with different yield functions which confirm practical efficiency of the suggested method .",
    "we consider an elasto - plastic body occupying a bounded domain @xmath33 with lipschitz boundary @xmath34 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are open and disjoint sets , @xmath36 has a positive surface measure .",

    "also , we use equivalent norms suitable for stress ( @xmath50 ) and strain ( @xmath51 ) fields , respectively : @xmath52 further , let @xmath53 denote the space of kinematically admissible displacements and @xmath54 be the load functional .",

    "the actual stress is a minimizer of the variational problem : @xmath64 where @xmath65 problem @xmath66 has a unique solution if and only if @xmath67 .",
