    "graphical models are powerful tools for analyzing relationships between a large number of random variables .",
    "their fundamental importance and universal applicability are due to two main factors .",
    "firstly , graphs can be used to represent complex dependence relationships among random variables .",
    "secondly , their structure is modular which means that complex graphs can be built from many simpler graphs .",
    "a graph consists of a set of nodes and a set of links between these nodes . in a graphical model",
    "the nodes are associated with random variables and links represent conditional dependence between the nodes . in a gaussian graphical model ( ggm )",
    "it is assumed that these random variables follow a multivariate normal distribution .",
    "an important property of ggms is that the concentration matrix , i.e. the inverse of the covariance matrix , fully determines represents the conditional independence structure , i.e. the graph .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) for the concentration matrix is the inverse of the sample covariance matrix , if it exists , and it exits when the number of observations is greater than the number of random variables .",
    "however , in many modern applications experiments consists of observing many features and many fewer observations . in genetics , variables are typically thousands of genes or gene products , whereas there are at best only a few hundred of observations .",
    "moreover , genetic networks are sparse , which means many of the genes behave conditionally independent from the others . in terms of ggms , it means that most of the elements in the precision matrix are equal to zero @xcite . as @xcite pointed out , parameter reduction involves a trade - off between costs and benefits , i.e. the amount of noise in a fitted model due to errors of estimation is reduced but errors of miss - specification are introduced because the null values are incorrect . @xcite introduced sparse covariance matrix estimation .",
    "the subset of zeros in the precision matrix can be selected in various ways analogous to the various forward and backward procedures used for selecting predictors variables in multiple regression analysis .",
    "however , the forward and backward procedures are not suitable for high - dimensional data problems .",
    "@xmath0-penalized likelihood inference @xcite , which has been extensively applied in regression models , can be adapted to graphical models in order to estimate sparse graphs .",
    "the idea is to constrain the @xmath0-norm penalty , i.e. the sum of the absolute values of the inverse of the covariance matrix , to be less or equal to a tuning parameter .",
    "the smaller the tuning parameter , the more zeroes will be estimated in the precision matrix .",
    "@xcite proposed to select edges for each node in the graph by regressing the variable on all other variables using @xmath0 penalized regression .",
    "this method reduces to solving @xmath1 separate regression problems , and does not provide an estimate of the matrix itself .",
    "penalized maximum likelihood approaches using the @xmath0 penalty have been considered by @xcite , who have all proposed different algorithms for computing the estimator of the precision matrix .",
    "@xcite introduced clipped absolute deviation penalty ( scad ) . on the other hand , @xcite extended this penalized maximum likelihood approach to general non - convex penalties .",
    "alternative penalized estimators based on the pseudo - likelihood instead of the likelihood were recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "theoretical properties of the @xmath0 penalized maximum likelihood estimator in the large @xmath1 scenario were derived by @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "@xcite established a so called sparsistency property of the penalized likelihood estimator , which means that all parameters that are zeroes are estimated as zero with probability tending to one when the sample size increases .",
    "the complexity of the ggms can be reduced if one imposes some symmetry constraints on the precision matrix , i.e. the number of parameters to be estimated is reduced by introducing equality constraints .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed gaussian graphical models with symmetry constraints .",
    "an important motivation for considering structured ggms is that conditions for maximum likelihood estimates to exist are less restrictive than for standard ggms .",
    "as @xcite pointed out symmetry models are particularly useful when parsimony is needed , for example when estimating precision matrices of large dimension with relatively few observations .",
    "the idea of this paper is to combine symmetry models and graphical lasso for modelling dynamic graphical models .",
    "in particular , we propose two models that impose symmetries constraints on the precision matrix @xmath2 and on the conditional correlation matrix @xmath3 , which is the negative scaled concentration matrix .",
    "the latter model is useful when the random variables are not measured on the same scale .",
    "we structure graphical models in a way that comes naturally to time - course data , by using the idea of coloured graphs to define factorially - structured precision matrices .    in section [ sec :",
    "motivating - examples ] , we introduce two motivating examples : a time - course microarray experiment involving t - cells and an educational experiment involving the edu dataset . in section [ sec : fgl ] , we introduce the idea of coloured graphs for time - course datasets and gaussian graphical models . the factorial graphical lasso for both precision , fgl@xmath4 , and conditional correlation matrices , fgl@xmath5 , are discussed in detail and the convex optimization problem with linear constraints is explained in section [ sec : pmle ] .",
    "section [ sec : modelselection ] addresses model selection and parameter smoothing selection which are important issues in graphical lasso .",
    "in particular , classical approaches such as aic , bic are derived to do model selection , and stability selection @xcite has been adapted to factorial graphical lasso models .",
    "section [ sec : simulationstudy ] provides encouraging numerical results in a simulation study . in section [ sec : dataanalysis ] , t - cell and edu datasets are studied in full detail .",
    "an important issue in system biology is to understand the system of interactions among several biological components such as protein - protein interaction and gene regulatory networks .",
    "hence , several techniques have been developed to collect data from different organisms .",
    "for instance , microarrays measure gene expression levels , i.e. the concentration of messenger rna produced when the gene is transcribed .",
    "a single microarrays is a snapshot in time of the expression of genes of an organism .",
    "gene expression , therefore , is a temporal process , which evolves dynamically in response to internal , genomic , and external , environmental , cues . even under stable conditions ,",
    "mrna is transcribed continuously and new proteins are generated .",
    "this process is highly regulated . in many cases ,",
    "the expression programme starts by activating a few transcription factors , which in turn activate many other genes that act in response to the new state .",
    "transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific dna sequences , thereby controlling the flow , i.e. transcription , of genetic information from dna to mrna . taking a snapshot of the expression profile following a new condition",
    "can reveal some of the genes that are specifically expressed in the new state .",
    "but rather than determining the set of differentially expressed genes , such as in the early days of microarray experiments , biologists are more interested in determining the transcriptional programme , i.e. determining the functional pathways . in order to infer the temporal interaction between the genes ,",
    "it is necessary to perform time - course expression experiments .",
    "the time - course genetic t - cell dataset @xcite is described in subsection [ microarraydata ] .",
    "many educational studies aim to establish the effect of one or more variables on one or more classroom outcomes .",
    "often such observational studies collect a large number of variables on a large number of disparate scales .",
    "often various proxy measures are available for these variables and therefore it is not uncommon to expect a complex set of relationships between the variables .",
    "our second motivating example is a longitudinal educational study described in @xcite .",
    "we describe this example in subsection [ edudata ] . the aim is to find a network that describes the relations among the items measured in the experiment .",
    "this second example clarifies the difference between the use of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "two cdna microarray experiments were performed to collect gene expression levels for t - cell activation analysis .",
    "activation of t - cell was produced by stimulating the cells with two treatments : the calcium ionosphere and the pkc activator phorbol ester pma .",
    "the human t - cells coming from the cellular line jakart were cultured in a laboratory .",
    "when the culture reached a consistency of @xmath8 cells / ml , the cells were treated with the two treatments pma and pkc .",
    "gene expression levels for 88 genes were collected for the following times after the treatments : 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 18 , 24 , 32 , 48 , 72 hours . in the first experiment",
    "the microarray was dived such that 34 subarray were obtained .",
    "each of these 34 subarray contained the strands of the 88 genes under investigation .",
    "strands are the complementary base for the rrna which is the transcribed copy of a single strand of dna after the process of transcription . in the second microarray experiment",
    "the microarray was dived into 10 sub - arrays .",
    "each of these 10 sub - arrays contained the strands of the 88 genes under investigation .",
    "each microarray was composed by ten different slides which were used for the two experiments to collect temporal measurements . for time 0 a set of cells were hybridized to the first slide after the cell cultured reached the right density and before the treatments were applied . for the second time point ( time 2 ) , another set of cells were hybridized in a second slide .",
    "the experiment was conducted by @xcite .    at this point",
    "we assume that the technical replicates are independent samples , and that the temporal replicates are dependent replicates from the same samples .",
    "these two assumptions result in a dataset with 44 independent replicates .",
    "these are strong assumptions , but can be justified from the underlying sampling scheme .",
    "nevertheless , this means that the conclusions from the analysis on t - cell , shown in section [ sec : dataanalysis ] , should be critically considered .",
    "two further steps were conducted by @xcite to obtain a set of genes that were highly expressed and normalized across the two microarrays .",
    "firstly , thirty genes with high variability between the two microarrays and within the same time point were removed .",
    "secondly , normalization methods were applied to remove systematic variation due to experimental artifacts .",
    "the normalization method used by @xcite is described in the paper written by @xcite .",
    "this results in a 44 i.i.d",
    ". @xmath9 dimensional observations .    in this subsection",
    ", we describe a possible partition for the maximum likelihood estimator of the precision matrix that is the inverse of the sample variance - covariance matrix . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we select a subset of 4 genes @xmath10 across 2 time points @xmath11 .",
    "then , we compute and show the empirical concentration matrix @xmath12 for the selected subset based on 44 observations in table [ concentrationo ] . in particular , @xmath12 can be partitioned as follows , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the elementwise hadamard matrix product , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are identity matrices , and @xmath17 is a square matrix with ones off the diagonal .    at this point",
    "we notice that four terms are showed in the summation and each of these terms can be interpreted .",
    "the first term indicates how well the variance of @xmath18 is predicted given the rest .",
    "for example it is easier to predict the behaviour of gene siv than the behaviour f gene scy .",
    "the second shows self - self conditional independence at temporal lag 1 .",
    "the self - self conditional independence represent relationships between the same genes measured into different time points .",
    "for example , gene znf is conditional dependent with itself given the rest of the genes and the dependence seems to be very strong @xmath19 .",
    "so , if gene znf is upregulated at time 0 then it will be upregulated at time 1 .",
    "the third term indicates the conditional dependencies at time 0 and 1 between genes at temporal lag zero . for the t - cell experiment",
    "this means that one is considering the relations between genes before the effect of the treatment .",
    "for example ,",
    "gene ccn and siv can be considered conditionally independent ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) since for both the temporal lag the element of the precision matrix is small .",
    "the last term indicates the conditional dependencies between time 0 and 1 at lag zero . in section [ sec : fgl ] we will refer to these partitions of the concentration matrix as natural partitions .",
    "moreover , we will use the idea of coloured graphs to make a different partition for the different temporal lags .",
    "the education dataset is a longitudinal dataset in which a set of scores regarding teacher and student behaviour were collected across 5 different time points , to wit @xmath22 months .",
    "the study was conducted in the netherlands and the students were followed - up during their first year of the secondary school @xcite . in particular ,",
    "20 classes of students and 24 educational scores were considered .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we consider a subset of four scores by naming the variables : controlled ( contr ) , autonomies ( auton ) , influence ( infl ) and proximity ( prox ) .",
    "the first two scores concern student behaviour , taking values between -3 and 3 .",
    "the last two scores measure teacher behaviour and take values between 0 and 5 .",
    "the scale for these variables is not compatible and conditional correlations are therefore more meaningful than the concentrations . in section [ sec : fgl ] , we show that conditional correlations are invariant under changes of scale for individual variables .",
    "the empirical conditional correlations based on 20 classes of students for 4 scores measured across 2 time points are shown in the upper triangular block ( italic numbers ) of the matrix in table [ correlationo ] while the conditional covariances are shown in the lower triangular block .",
    "similarly the example in the preview subsection [ microarraydata ] we can partition the empirical conditional correlation matrix in 4 parts as follows : @xmath23 were @xmath24 is equal to the negative of the scaled precision matrix .",
    "this means that the conditional elements on the lower part have been divided by the square root of the two corresponding elements on the diagonal @xmath25 . at this point",
    "each of diagonal elements is in the range @xmath26 and @xmath27 and it corresponds to a conditional correlation measure .",
    "the interpretation of these measures is equivalent to the interpretation of the elements of the precision matrix .",
    "conditional correlations are pure numbers , i.e. the scale of the variables do not have any influence , and they are in a range between @xmath26 and @xmath27 so that numbers close to zero indicates conditional independence , as before , and numbers close to one or -1 indicate strong positive and negative conditional dependencies , respectively .",
    "whereas of the conditional covariance elements a positive conditional correlation indicate a positive relations between the corresponding genes .",
    "an undirected graph @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a set of vertices corresponds to a set of random variables , and @xmath30 the set of links corresponds to a set of conditional independencies , is defined a gaussian graphical model if the set of random variables follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "vertices of the graph @xmath31 in static dataset have no natural order . whereas for longitudinal dataset or time - course dataset a natural order can be established .",
    "for example , gene znf in the t - cell dataset is measured at time 1 ( which is gene expression are collected after 0 hour of treatment ) and at time 2 ( which is after two hours of treatment ) .",
    "vertexes znf , ccn , siv and scy are called natural vertexes . generally speaking ,",
    "let @xmath28 be a graph where @xmath32 is a finite set of vertices and @xmath33 is a subset of ordered pairs of distinct vertices .",
    "the set of natural vertices is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an ordered set , typically describing time points .",
    "note that the set @xmath36 is unlabelled , but here described as an ordered set for convenience of notation .",
    "moreover , we have seen in example 1 and 2 that the empirical correlation matrix or the empirical concentration matrix can be written as a sum of four terms .",
    "these four terms are called natural partitions , and they can be represented in a dynamic graph as shown in figure [ figgrahex ] . here , we assume that the last term of formula [ eq1 ] is zero so that genes at time 1 and at time 2 are assumed conditionally independent .",
    "the first term of formula [ eq1 ] is not represented in figure [ eq1 ] .",
    "the second term is represented by the dot lines and it represents the self - self interactions .",
    "the third term is represented by the dashed and continuous lines .",
    "we will refer to the graph in figure [ eq1 ] as dynamic graphs , which can be formally defined as follows :    a dynamic graph is a pair @xmath28 , where @xmath37 is a finite set of vertices and @xmath33 is a set of ordered couples of elements . @xmath36 and @xmath38 are finite sets .    hence , the main characteristic of dynamic graphs is that the same vertices are measured across different time points . in the t - cell example",
    "the same 56 genes were measured across 10 time points and between time point @xmath39 and @xmath40 the experimental conditions were changed .",
    "we notice that conditional correlations between the natural vertices at time point one and time point 2 described in table [ correlationo ] are similar . on the end",
    "the diagonal elements in the first block of table [ concentrationo ] and in the second block are similar .",
    "moreover , it is intuitive to think that the conditional correlation between gene 1 at time 1 and gene 1 at time 2 can be considered equivalent or that self - self correlations between genes across two time points can be consider to be equal . in order to formalize this idea we use of coloured graphs .    a coloured graph @xmath41 is a triplet , where @xmath42 is a graph and @xmath43 is a mapping on the links , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a finite set of colours .",
    "thus , a coloured graph induces partitions on the graph by @xmath43 , that is different subsets of @xmath30 are visualized with different colours . for example , three different colours ( i.e , three different type of lines ) are represented in figure [ figgrahex ] .",
    "the dash line represents one colour ( or sub - partition ) , the continuous line represents the second colour and the dot line represents the third colour .",
    "let us denote the partitions induced by the coloured graphs @xmath43 by @xmath46 , i.e. : @xmath47 where @xmath48 indicates that the partition is induced on @xmath30 , and @xmath30 stands for the complete set of links .",
    "the mapping can be applied to the subsets of @xmath30 which are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "each partition represents relationships between natural vertices at some time point @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 , and @xmath53 be subsets of vertices and links where @xmath54 are natural partitions such that : @xmath55 and @xmath56 each of these partitions is interpreted as follows : @xmath49 considers the lag @xmath57 interactions between the same natural vertices , and @xmath50 is a graph at time lag @xmath57 .",
    "we induce further partitions on @xmath49 and @xmath50 by using the idea of coloured graphs in order to give more consistent interpretations of dynamic graphs . in particular , we consider four mappings .",
    "firstly , @xmath58 indicates that all edges in the partition are coloured with the same colour .",
    "secondly , @xmath59 indicates that all edges in the partition are coloured with colours which are the same within natural vertices .",
    "thirdly , @xmath60 indicates that all edges in the partition are coloured with the same colour within time points and different colours across natural vertices .",
    "finally , @xmath61 indicates that all edges in the partition are coloured differently across time points and natural vertices",
    ". this can be summarize with the following functions : @xmath62 where we can substitute at @xmath30 a specific natural partition @xmath49 or @xmath50 for @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 induce partitions as follows : @xmath67 and @xmath68 for example , @xmath69 induces the following partition of @xmath49 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "edges belonging to @xmath72 are coloured with the @xmath73 colours @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "we abuse notation and let @xmath75 and @xmath76 in order to express that @xmath77 and @xmath78 } , i.e. the graph @xmath31 does not contain such edges .    in table",
    "[ degreeoffreedom ] we show the number of colours for any combination of @xmath54 and graph colouring .    the total number of colours @xmath79 can be calculate from table [ degreeoffreedom ] .",
    "figure [ figgrahex ] shows an example of `` coloured graph '' where vertices @xmath80 are all of the same colour and edges with the same line styles are of the same colours .",
    "the graph resembles the following model : @xmath81 , \\label{eq : modelprec}\\ ] ] where , firstly the following natural partitions ( sub - partitions ) are created : @xmath82 note that if a couple @xmath83 is present then the couple @xmath83 is present too .",
    "we have omitted the symmetric couples from the sets to simplify the notation .",
    "secondly , @xmath84 induces the following subset : @xmath85 so that a colour is created .",
    "then , @xmath86 brings the following two sub - partitions : @xmath87 so that two colours have been created .    in order to consider a graphical model nodes of the dynamic graph need to be associated with the random variables .",
    "then , we can assume that nodes follow a multivariate normal distribution .",
    "in what follows , we consider the set of vertices and nodes of the dynamic coloured graph .",
    "moreover , we denote with @xmath88 the set of random variables .",
    "each vertices @xmath89 is related to a random variable @xmath90 .",
    "a graphical model @xmath91 is a couple @xmath31 and @xmath92 , where @xmath31 is a dynamic graph and @xmath92 is a probability distribution on @xmath93 satisfying some markovian properties , i.e. set of conditional independence relations encoded by the undirected edges @xmath30 .    in order to connect the idea of coloured graphs and graphical models",
    "we give the following definition :    a factorial graphical model @xmath94 is a triplet @xmath95 , where @xmath31 is a dynamic graph , @xmath92 is a probability distribution and @xmath43 is a mapping on the natural partitions @xmath49 and @xmath50 , for @xmath96 and @xmath38 is the total number of time points .",

    "moreover , equality constraints on conditional correlations can be imposed such that edges with the same colours imply these equality restrictions . here",
