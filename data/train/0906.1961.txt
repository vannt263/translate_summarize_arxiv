    "since light is extremely elusive there is a great interest to store photons in a small volume for a certain time .",
    "storage of photons in an applicable way can be achieved using solid state cavities .",
    "used cavities to create large pulse delays with small group velocities by storing light in a cavity inside a 2d photonic crystal slab @xcite .",
    "another application where storage of light in a cavity plays a crucial role is changing the color of light as was studied by preble _",
    "ultimately , with a microcavity the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electro dynamics can be entered @xcite . in the strong coupling regime a cavity and a two level system together form a new set of states .",
    "normal - mode splitting of a coupled exciton - photon mode was observed in a planar microcavity @xcite .",
    "other interesting experiments have been performed on planar cavities , e.g bose - einstein condensation of exciton polaritons @xcite and the investigation of the limitations of a scanning fabry - prot interferometer @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic parameter of a cavity resonance is the storage time of light @xmath1 .",
    "the storage time is defined by the response of the cavity resonance to a dirac pulse .",
    "excitation of the electromagnetic field in a cavity was studied in @xcite .",
    "the response to the dirac pulse is given by an exponential decay of the intensity _",
    "i(t ) _ in the cavity resonance @xcite : @xmath2 with @xmath3 the initial intensity that the pulse stores in the cavity . however",
    ", in more complex cavities the behavior of the cavity can be very different from the single exponential case @xcite . to compare cavities independent of their resonance frequencies @xmath4 , the widely used figure of merit is the resonance quality factor _ q _ , which is defined as : @xmath5 physically , the quality factor is proportional to the ratio between the total energy stored and the energy lost per cycle . at optical frequencies a cavity with a feasible high quality factor of @xmath6 is relatively slow with a response time in the order of nanoseconds . a cavity with a moderate quality factor @xmath7 , however , is fast with a response time of picoseconds .",
    "the picosecond timescale allows ultrafast access and storage of light in the cavities .    a common procedure to estimate the quality factor of a cavity is to measure a transmission or reflectivity spectrum and extract _ q _ from the relative linewidth of the cavity resonance @xcite .",
    "for a single resonance without dephasing , one can use the wiener - khintchine theorem , which relates the field autocorrelate to the intensity spectrum , to obtain @xmath8 however , if there is significant dephasing , e.g. due to inhomogeneous broadening or thermal noise , @xmath9 will in general be larger and @xmath10 .    from many resonating systems in condensed matter and solid state physics ,",
    "it is known that besides homogeneous broadening there is also the possibility of inhomogeneous broadening of a resonance @xcite . in the case of an ensemble of resonators inhomogeneous",
    "broadening of a resonance results from inhomogeneities in the resonance frequency . if the resonance frequency is different for each resonator the linewidth of the ensemble is broader than the linewidth of a single resonator and the ensemble linewidth is typically determined by the distribution of resonance frequencies . in the case of inhomogeneous broadening the linewidth will only give a lower boundary for the range of possible _ q _ values .",
    "the true quality factor must in this case be determined from dynamic measurements .    a dynamic measurement to determine the quality factor is a cavity ring down experiment as was treated in @xcite .",
    "in this case a cavity is excited by a pulse and the intensity emitted from the cavity is measured as a function of time . in the case of storage times in the order of nanoseconds and very high quality factors ( @xmath11 ) time correlated single photon counting can be used to determine the storage time @xcite . in our case of ultrafast cavities that decay on a ps timescale with moderate quality factor ( @xmath12 ) , an intensity autocorrelation function is the method of choice for determining the quality factor .    the normalized correlation function that is measured is an intensity autocorrelation function @xmath13 , which is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the delay time between the pulses from each of the interferometer branches , @xmath16 is equal to maximum value of the unnormalized autocorrelation value , and @xmath17 is the time dependent intensity . there is no phase in equation [ eq:2ndorderautocorrelation ] , which means that this is the proper autocorrelation function , also in case of dephasing .",
    "the autocorrelate has its maximum at delay @xmath18 , when the pulses in the two branches of the michelson interferometer overlap .",
    "for example the autocorrelate of a gaussian pulse is given by a gaussian shape , where the width of the input pulse @xmath19 and the autocorrelate are related as @xmath20 . from the autocorrelate of a pulse stored in the cavity resonance , the storage time can be found from the full width at half maximum @xmath21 of @xmath13 , with @xmath22 .",
    "our structure is a planar cavity that consists of a gaas @xmath0-thick layer ( 277 nm thick ) , sandwiched between two bragg stacks .",

    "the reflectance spectrum of a gold mirror was used as a reference .    for pulse transmission and the intensity autocorrelate",
    ", we used a titanium sapphire laser that emits @xmath33 ps pulses at @xmath34 nm at a repetition rate of 1 khz ( hurricane , spectra physics ) .",
    "the laser drives an optical parametric amplifier ( opa , topas 800-fs , light conversion ) , which generates the pulses used to probe the photonic cavity .",
    "the center wavelength of the opa pulses can be tuned between 450 nm and 2400 nm .",
    "we used a fiber optic spectrometer ( usb2000 , ocean optics ) to measure transmission spectra of the femtosecond pulses .",
    "we measured with an unfocused collimated beam with a spot diameter of 2 mm , and a numerical aperture na = @xmath35 .",
    "the intensity autocorrelation function was measured using a pulse check autocorrelator ( ape gmbh ) .",
    "the autocorrelator consists of a michelson interferometer with a scanned delay path and a nonlinear crystal that generates second harmonic light .",
    "the autocorrelator has a maximum range of 15 ps with a resolution of 1 fs .",
    "we used the same beam parameters as in transmission .",
    "the intensity on the sample is 100 @xmath36 , sufficiently low to avoid non - linear effects .",
    "simulations were performed with the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method using a freely available software package with subpixel smoothing for increased accuracy @xcite .",

    "a fabry - prot fringe pattern is visible , while inside the stopband a narrow trough in reflection and a narrow peak in transmission mark the position of the cavity resonance .",
    "an effect of the spatial gradient in the cavity thickness is visible in the spectra in figure [ 071123refltrans ] b : the frequencies of the peak and trough , which are measured at different sample position , differ slightly .",
    "reflectivity and transmission measurements on the same spot are shown as an inset in figure [ 071123refltrans ] b. the trough and the peak are clearly at the same wavelength as expected .",

    "the thickness of the @xmath23 layers ( @xmath39 nm and @xmath40 nm ) and the thickness of the cavity ( @xmath41 nm ) were obtained by fitting the results of the calculations to the measured spectrum .",
    "these values are in agreement with expected values from the fabrication process .",
    "the calculation fits well with respect to frequency and amplitude .",
    "the reflectivity of the measured stopband is higher than the calculated value of 100 % because of a small systematic error in the gold reference spectrum .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ 071123refltrans ] b that the calculated linewidth of the cavity resonance is narrower than the measured linewidth .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to inhomogeneous broadening of the measured linewidth , due to the spatial gradient in the cavity layer thickness . with the 100 @xmath32 diameter spot we average over different positions and therefore over different resonance frequencies . broadening due to a spread in wavevectors",
    "can be neglected since the numerical aperture of the impinging beam was made very small ( @xmath42 ) , as opposed to @xcite , where a high na was used .",

    "we measured the intensity autocorrelation traces to determine the true storage time and _ q _ of the cavity resonance with a time - resolved measurement .",
