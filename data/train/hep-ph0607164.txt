    "over the past decade a striking regularity has been established in heavy ion collisions : from sis to rhic , particle yields are consistent with the assumption of chemical equilibrium  @xcite . furthermore , the chemical freeze - out temperature , @xmath0 , and the baryon chemical potential @xmath1 follow a strikingly regular pattern as the beam energy increases .",
    "this has led to several proposals describing the freeze - out curve in @xmath2 plane .",
    "the conditions of fixed energy per particle  @xcite , baryon+anti - baryon density  @xcite , normalized entropy density  @xcite as well as percolation model  @xcite all lead to reasonable descriptions of the freeze - out curve in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "the results have been compared with the most recent  @xcite chemical freeze - out parameters obtained in the thermal - statistical analysis of particle yields in  @xcite where the sensitivity and dependence of the results on parameters is analyzed and discussed .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that , within present accuracies , all chemical freeze - out criteria give a fairly good description of the particle yields , however , the low energy heavy - ion data favor the constant energy per hadron as a condition for chemical freeze - out .",
    "this condition also shows the weakest sensitivity on model assumptions and parameters .",
    "this criterion was first identified  @xcite by comparing the thermal parameters at sis energy with those obtained at sps .",
    "it was shown that the average energy per particle at sis energy reaches approximately the same value of 1 gev as calculated at the critical temperature expected for deconfinement at @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , known results for chemical freeze - out parameters at the ags also reproduced the same value of energy per particle .",
    "thus , it was suggested that the condition of a fixed energy per hadron is the chemical freeze - out criterion in heavy - ion collisions . a comparison with the extracted results on @xmath0 and @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ [ eovern06 ] ] .",
    "the best estimate gives a value @xmath4 1.08 gev .",
    "in addition to the fixed @xmath5 criterion , alternative proposals have been made to describe chemical freeze - out in heavy - ion collisions at all energies :    * a fixed value for the sum of baryon and anti - baryon densities , @xmath6 , of approximately 0.12/@xmath7  @xcite ; * a self - consistent equation for the densities based on geometric estimates using percolation theory  @xcite ; @xmath8+\\frac{0.34}{v_h } \\left[\\frac{n_b(t,\\mu)}{n(t,\\mu)}\\right].\\ ] ] * a fixed value of the entropy density , @xmath9 , of approximately 7  @xcite .    a comparison of these proposals is given in fig.[[comparison ] ] which shows that all proposals give a reasonable description in the region between ags and rhic energies .",
    "deviations appear at the highest rhic energy and at beam energies between ags and sis .",
    "it would therefore be very interesting to have good data in this energy region .    independently of any particular criterium or model for the freeze - out condition , a numerical parametrization , shown in fig .",
    "[ [ numeric ] ] , is given by .",
    "values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 deduced from particle multiplicities in heavy ion collisions for a wide range of beam energies . ]     and @xmath1 obtained from particle multiplicities in heavy ion collisions . ]",
    "the values obtained for @xmath1 as a function of beam energy are displayed in fig .",
    "[ [ e_mub ] ] .",
    "as this shows a smooth variation with energy , it can be parametrized as @xmath11 this leads to the expectation that @xmath12  mev at lhc energies .",
    "similarly , the freeze - out temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ [ e_t ] ] .",
    "a straightforward extrapolation leads to a value at lhc energies @xmath13  mev  @xcite .",
    "there is by now a long history of measurements of particle abundances in heavy ion collisions covering a wide range of beam energies .",
    "the case for chemical equilibrium has become stronger over the years with every new analysis confirming and reinforcing conclusions reached previously . to distinguish between the various proposals which have been made in the literature",
    ", the lower energy range at the ags acquires a special significance as it will make it possible to discriminate between them .",
