    "the ability to control the rotational motion and to angularly confine molecules has various applications in molecular sciences .",
    "this includes studies of steric effects in chemical reactions , both bimolecular and photoinduced , and the possibility to investigate molecules from their own point of view , the molecular frame .",
    "the latter mitigates the usual blurring of experimental observables caused by the random orientation of molecules in uncontrolled samples .",
    "access to molecular frame measurements is crucial in several applications , notably in various modern schemes aiming at observing the ( coupled ) motion of nuclei and electrons during chemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "methods based on the use of moderately intense , nonresonant , near - infrared laser pulses have proven particularly useful for controlling the alignment and , in conjunction with weak dc electric fields , orientation of a broad range of molecules .",
    "alignment refers to the confinement of molecule - fixed axes along laboratory - fixed axes , and orientation usually refers to the molecular dipole moment pointing in a particular direction  @xcite . for a linear molecule",
    ", only a single axis needs to be confined in space to ensure complete rotational control .",
    "this can be achieved by a linearly polarized laser pulse , which will align the most polarizable axis ( mpa ) , i.e. the internuclear axis of the molecule .",
    "this is termed one - dimensional ( 1d ) alignment @xcite .",
    "combined with a ( weak ) static electric field it can also control the head - versus - tail order of a polar molecule , i.e. , induce 1d orientation  @xcite .",
    "complete rotational control of asymmetric top molecules requires the confinement of three molecular axes to laboratory frame fixed axes , resulting in 3d alignment . in the adiabatic limit , where the laser pulse is turned on slower than the rotational periods of the molecule",
    ", it has been shown that an elliptically polarized laser pulse can induce 3d alignment  @xcite . for polar molecules , where the permanent dipole moment ( dm ) is parallel to the mpa",
    "it has also been shown that 3d orientation , defined as 3d alignment and a unique direction of the dm , can be achieved by combining the elliptically polarized laser pulse with a weak static electric field parallel to the major polarization axis  @xcite . for most asymmetric top molecules ,",
    "the dm does , however , not coincide with any principal axis of polarizability .",
    "while 3d alignment is expected to work well for these less symmetric molecules , it remains to be explored if the combined action of a linearly or elliptically polarized laser pulse and a weak or strong static electric field can efficiently induce 3d orientation .",
    "also , as discussed here , the precise meaning of 3d orientation must be specified for molecules with low symmetry .    in the current work",
    "we investigate 3d alignment and orientation of asymmetric top molecules where the dm is not parallel to a principal axis of polarizability .",
    "our studies are motivated by the fact that many important biomolecules , e.g. , amino acids , nucleic acids , peptides , and dna strands , belong to this class of molecules .",
    "controlling how they are turned in space would be of significant value in novel and emerging schemes for time - resolved molecular imaging  @xcite .",
    "following the conclusions from the current work , this three - dimensional control is indeed possible .",
    "our studies focus on 6-chloropyridazine-3-carbonitrile ( , cpc ) .",
    "the molecule is chosen because the dm is off - set by 57.1@xmath0 from the mpa and because the atomic composition makes it possible to determine its 3-dimensional spatial orientation through coulomb explosion imaging .",
    "a sketch of the molecular structure of cpc and the position of the mpa and dm vector are shown in fig : mol - structure .",
    "the planar molecule consists of an aromatic pyridazine ring with a nitrile and a chlorine substituent . the n - n bond is shorter than the c - n and c - c bonds in the aromatic ring causing the bond angle of the substituents on the ring to bend slightly towards the pyridazine nitrogens , as can be seen from the energy optimized geometry of the molecule shown in fig : mol - structure .",
    "quantum chemical calculations   determine the electric dipole moment of cpc to be with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , i.e. , in the molecular plane and at an angle of 57.1@xmath4with respect to the @xmath5 axis .",
    "the static polarizability components of cpc are determined to be @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "a few mbar of cpc ( chemfuture pharmatech , @xmath9 chemical purity ) was seeded in a helium carrier gas at a backing pressure of and expanded into vacuum through a pulsed even - lavie valve  @xcite heated to c. the expansion was skimmed twice before entering an electrostatic deflector , where the molecules were deflected according to the effective dipole moment @xmath10  of their specific rotational quantum state  @xcite .",
    "the quantum - state - dispersed molecular beam entered a velocity map imaging ( vmi ) spectrometer where it was crossed at by two collinear laser beams .",
    "the laser beams were focused by a spherical lens ( @xmath11 ) mounted on a motorized translation stage .",
    "this allowed for the height of the foci to be scanned with high precision .",
    "hereby it is possible to measure the vertical intensity profile of the molecular beam such that the effect of the electrostatic deflector can be characterized .",
    "furthermore , the focused laser beams can be directed to the most deflected molecules which are the ones residing in the lowest lying rotational states and , thereby , those that undergo the strongest alignment and orientation  @xcite .",
    "the molecules were aligned and oriented by the combined effect of pulses from one of the laser beams ( yag pulse , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , injection seeded ) and the weak static electric field from the vmi spectrometer ( @xmath16was varied between values of and ) .",

    "we start by showing that a linearly polarized yag pulse induces 1d alignment of the cpc molecules . for this purpose ,",
    "the emission directions of ions are detected .",
    "the expected action of the yag pulse is that it aligns the mpa along its polarization axis and as such an experimental observable that provides direct and precise information about the spatial orientation of this axis would be ideal . unlike in higher - symmetry molecules ,",
    "e.g. , iodobenzene  @xcite , no such observable exists .",
    "the emission direction of ions comes close , assuming axial recoil along the c - cl bond axis , since the c - cl axis is only off - set by 3 degrees from the mpa .",
    "when only the linearly - polarized probe pulse is applied , polarized perpendicular to the detector , the image shown in fig:1d - alignment(a ) is circularly symmetric , as expected for randomly oriented molecules .    .",

    "when the yag pulse is included the ions tightly localize along its polarization axis parallel to the detector plane , see fig:1d - alignment(b ) .",
    "these observations show that the c - cl bond axes of the cpc molecules are aligned along the yag pulse polarization axis , i.e. , that 1d alignment is induced .",
    "the degree of alignment is quantified by determining the average value of @xmath69 , @xmath67 , where @xmath70 is the angle between the yag pulse polarization and the projection of a ion velocity vector on the detector screen . only a confined radial range is used to determine @xmath67 .",
    "this range at the outermost part of the images is marked by circles in fig:1d - alignment(b ) .",
    "it corresponds to ions originating from a highly directional coulomb explosion process .",
    "the derived values are plotted as a function of the yag pulse intensity , @xmath68 in fig:1d - alignment(c ) .",
    "@xmath67rises from 0.5 , the value characterizing a sample of randomly oriented molecules , at @xmath71 to @xmath72 at the highest value of @xmath68 .",
    "this behaviour is fully consistent with many previous studies of 1d adiabatic alignment  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath67values determined underestimate the true degree of alignment due to the offset between the c - cl axis and the mpa and imperfect axial recoil .    in order to investigate the effect on the molecular alignment when the yag pulse polarization is changed from linear to elliptical ,",
    "an ellipticity ratio of 3:1 was applied , i.e. , the intensity along the major polarization axis of the yag pulse is three times the intensity along the minor axis . for these measurements , and images , displayed in fig : cpc - alignment , are used to infer information about the molecular alignment .    .",
    "the images represent either a `` side - view '' when the major polarization axis is parallel to the detector ( vertical in fig : cpc - alignment ) , i.e. , the molecules are watched from the side , or an `` end - view '' when the major polarization axis is perpendicular to the detector , i.e. , the molecules are watched from the end  @xcite .    for ions ,",
    "the molecule is imaged in side - view .",
    "fig : cpc - alignment(a1 ) shows the image obtained with the probe pulse by itself , polarized vertically , and serves as a reference . in panel ( a2 ) measurements including the linearly polarized yag pulse",
    "are shown .",
    "the ions appear as two distinct areas at large radii along the vertical axis and as two pairs of wings protruding nearly horizontally from the vertical centerline .",
    "the 1d alignment means that the mpa of the molecules is confined along the vertical @xmath19 axis and it implies that the recoiling ions from the group will be ejected vertically , either up or down depending on the orientation of the molecule .",
    "these ions form the two distinct centerline regions of signal similar to the ion structure ( fig:1d - alignment(b ) ) used for the determination of the 1d alignment discussed above .",
    "the wing structure is interpreted as ions originating from coulomb explosion of the n atoms in the aromatic ring .",
    "since the linearly polarized yag pulse does not impose any constraint on the rotation of the ring the ions will be emitted in a double - torus - like pattern . upon projection on the 2d detector plane",
    "this gives the wing - structure .",
    "covariance analysis  @xcite confirms that in the wing - structure the two ions from a single molecule are predominately produced on the same sides of the tori supporting this interpretation .",
    "when the yag pulse polarization is changed to elliptical the image in fig : cpc - alignment  ( a3 ) is obtained .",
    "the ions from the ring are confined close to the vertical axis , whereas the ion emission structure from the cn group is practically unchanged .",
    "this shows that the alignment of the mpa is not much changed while the molecular plane is no longer free to rotate , but instead it is confined to the polarization plane .",
    "this demonstrates that the molecule is 3d aligned .",
    "the corresponding end - view images of in row  ( b ) corroborate this interpretation : with a linearly polarized yag pulse the ions emerge in the circularly symmetric pattern shown in panel ( b2 ) , corresponding to free rotation of the molecular plane around the yag pulse polarization axis .",
    "( note that in this measurement the probe pulse polarization is perpendicular to the detector plane ) .",
    "for an elliptically polarized yag pulse , the ions are angularly localized around the vertical minor polarization axis , i.e. , the molecular plane is confined to the polarization plane .",
    "the radial structures of panel ( b2 ) and ( b3 ) are the same , confirming that the long axes of the molecules remain aligned along the major polarization axis .",
    "thus , the images confirm that the cpc molecules are 3d aligned by the elliptically polarized yag pulse .",
    "first we discuss the orientation that results from the combined action of a linearly polarized , moderately intense laser and a weak static electric field . all previous studies comprised molecules where the permanent dipole moment was parallel to the mpa including linear rotors  @xcite , symmetric tops  @xcite and asymmetric tops  @xcite .",
    "in these cases 1d orientation , defined as 1d alignment and a preferred direction of the permanent dipole moment , was induced . for studies employing ion imaging , as in the current work",
    ", orientation was observed when the molecule was rotated away from the side - view geometry used in pure alignment measurements ; see fig : cpc_exp_setup_1d_3d_orient(a ) for a sketch of this experimental approach .",
    "( the angle between the static field direction and the ( major ) polarization axis of the yag pulse ) is changed . ]    in practice this was done by rotating the yag pulse polarization to angles where @xmath73 .",
    "this provides a component of the static field along the dipole moment which mixes the pendular states of the tunneling doublet to form the corresponding oriented states .",
    "the experimental findings showed that the degree of orientation increased monotonically as @xmath23 was rotated from @xmath74 towards @xmath75 or @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "later experiments and analysis have identified this behaviour as resulting from nonadiabatic dynamics in the mixed - field orientation @xcite . in the following",
    "we investigate if the angular offset of the dipole moment from the mpa in cpc influences the efficiency of mixed - field orientation and if the degree of orientation peaks when the mpa or the permanent dipole moment is directed along the static field from the vmi spectrometer .",
    "the experimental observables used are the ion images which provide information about the orientation of the mpa .",
    "examples of ion images recorded for @xmath77 @xmath78 are shown as insets in fig : beta .     between the static field and the ( major ) polarization axis of the yag pulse for different field strengths .",
    "the values are determined from the distribution of ions .",
    "the insets show raw ion images at ( left ) @xmath77 and ( right ) @xmath79 . ]    for @xmath77  @xmath78 , more ( less ) ions are detected on the upper half of the detector than on the lower half . in analogy with previous studies we interpret these observations as 1d orientation due to the combined effect of the yag laser field and the static electric extraction field  @xcite , where the dm @xmath5-component orients along the projection of the dc electric field onto the mpa .",
    "this implies that the partially negative nitrile end will be directed towards the repeller electrode where the potential is highest and the c - cl bond towards the extractor electrode where the potential is lowest  see fig : cpc_exp_setup_1d_3d_orient(a ) . as a consequence",
    ", ions are expected to be ejected upwards ( downwards ) for @xmath77  @xmath78 .",
    "this is in agreement with the up - down asymmetry in the images .",
    "the degree of 1d orientation is quantified by dividing the number of ions detected on the upper half of the detector by the total amount of ions detected ( @xmath80 ) , corrected for the slight up - down detector asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetry parameter , is plotted in fig : beta as a function of @xmath23 recorded for two values of the static electric field .",
    "the figure shows that the degree of orientation increases gradually as the mpa is rotated towards the direction of the static electric field .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that observed for molecules such as ocs  @xcite and iodobenzene  @xcite where the mpa and the permanent dipole moment are parallel .",
    "the experimental findings are rationalized by our computational treatment  discussed in sec : theory - results .",
    "next we investigated 3d orientation .",
    "in previous studies 3d orientation was defined as 3d alignment occurring together with a preferred direction of the permanent dipole moment axis , which coincides with the mpa for molecules with rotational point group symmetry like iodobenzene and benzonitrile ( molecular point group @xmath81 ) . in the case of molecules like cpc ( molecular point group @xmath82 ) full 3d orientation [ fig : cpc_exp_setup_1d_3d_orient(c ) ] requires preferred directions in space for at least two components of the dipole moment . for cpc",
    "this would be the @xmath5-axis and the @xmath37-axis  see fig : mol - structure .",
    "a slightly less complete 3d confinement of the molecular rotations is 3d alignment and 1d orientation of one of the principal axes of polarizability .",
    "this can be either the @xmath5-axis ( the mpa ) as illustrated in fig : cpc_exp_setup_1d_3d_orient(b ) or the @xmath37-axis which will be discussed in sec : theory - results .    in the experiment we measured images at different values of @xmath23 for an elliptically polarized yag pulse with the same parameters as the one used to induce 3d alignment ( where @xmath83 or @xmath74 ) .",
    "the results , displayed in fig : beta , are very similar to the results obtained with the linearly polarized yag pulse and establish that 1d orientation of the @xmath5-axis occurs .",
    "no information about the @xmath37-axis can be extracted from this ion species .",
    "images of and ions were also recorded .",
    "both ion species are confined along the vertical centerline of the images which shows that 3d alignment occurs - similar to the case presented in fig : cpc - alignment(a3 ) and fig : cpc - alignment(b3 )  as expected .",
    "neither of these ion species are , however , well suited to extract information about the orientation of the @xmath37-axis . at this point",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the cpc molecules are , at least , 3d aligned and simultaneously have their @xmath5-axis 1d oriented .",
    "in this subsection we consider only the influence of a static electric field on the cpc molecule , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) term of the stark effect interaction couples states with different parity under inversion along the molecular @xmath5 ( @xmath37 ) axis . as the dc field strength",
    "is increased , the electric dipole moment @xmath36 gets oriented along the electric field axis .",
    "the expectation values @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , see eqn : cos_smu , [ eqn : cos_sz ] and [ eqn : cos_sy ] , measure the orientation of @xmath36 and of the molecular @xmath5 and @xmath37 axes , respectively .",
    "they are presented as a function of the dc field strength @xmath87 in   fig : orientation_cosines . for the rotational ground state and @xmath88 , we compute @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . in such a weak field",
    "the orientation of the @xmath37-axis , corresponding to the largest dipole moment component , is smaller than the orientation of the @xmath5 axis , see   fig : orientation_cosines , because the energy gap from the ground state to the first level with odd parity under inversion along the @xmath37-axis ( @xmath92 ) is larger than to the first level with odd parity under the inversion along the @xmath5-axis ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "when @xmath87 is increased , the hybridization of the pendular levels increases , and this trend in the orientation is inverted ; we encounter that @xmath94 for @xmath95 , see   fig : orientation_cosines . in the strong - dc - field regime @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "note that these quantities provide upper bounds to the dc field interactions because the angular dependence in eqn : hamil_electric is set to @xmath118 , which holds only for fully oriented states . as a consequence , for weak dc fields ,",

    "the complexity of their field - dressed dynamics is significantly enhanced due to the large number of avoided crossings .",
    "these avoided crossings provoke abrupt changes on their directional properties , which play an important role for the mixed - field orientation of the molecular beam  @xcite .    for the experimentally accessed regime of dc field strengths ,",
    "@xmath120 is practically independent of @xmath137 , whereas @xmath122 increases until a large orientation is reached for high intensities of elliptically polarized pulse , e.g. , @xmath138 and @xmath139 for and @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath123 .",
    "regarding the behaviour of the orientation cosines @xmath120 and @xmath122 versus @xmath23 , three different regimes are observed : i ) for weak alignment lasers , when the pendular doublets are not yet formed , or the energy splitting between two neighbouring doublets is larger than the dc - field interaction , @xmath120 or @xmath122 monotonically increase with @xmath23 , respectively ; ii ) for stronger laser fields , the energy separations between the doublets are significantly reduced , and the orientation is independent of @xmath23 ; iii ) if the dc - field interaction is much larger than the laser - field interaction , the orientation in both directions reaches a maximum at @xmath142 , because the effect of the static field becomes optimal at this field configuration . in particular , this time - independent description predicts an orientation of the mpa along the @xmath19 axis independent of @xmath23 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the smooth behaviour of @xmath80 versus @xmath23 in fig : beta can not be reproduced with this theoretical treatment .",
    "indeed , the authors have recently demonstrated that only a time - dependent study can reproduce the intriguing physical phenomena taking place in the mixed - field orientation experiments  @xcite of @xmath81 symmetric molecules .",
    "the detailed quasi - static description of the cpc molecule in mixed dc and linearly or elliptically polarized non - resonant ac fields presented here provides a solid basis for a future time - dependent study of this system , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "let us remark that the knowledge of the adiabatic energy structure in mixed - fields is required for an adequate interpretation of the non - adiabatic phenomena taking place in the field - dressed dynamics , such as the formation of pendular doublets  @xcite .    for completeness",
    ", we theoretically investigated the mixed - field orientation of thermal samples of cpc , in order to mimic the state - selection , assuming that the alignment and orientation processes are adiabatic  @xcite .",
    "for an elliptically polarized laser with @xmath15 , @xmath88 , and @xmath123 , the molecular sample at @xmath118  k is strongly aligned but practically not oriented , consistent with experimental findings  @xcite : @xmath143 ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 . by reducing the temperature to @xmath149  k , the alignment is slightly improved to @xmath150 ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 ) and the orientation is strongly increased @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "this demonstrates even that for our very cold molecular beams ( @xmath156  k ) the state - selection of low - energy rotational states is crucial for the creation of orientation  @xcite .",
    "we have performed a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of mixed - field orientation of the 6-chloropyridazine-3-carbonitrile ( cpc ) molecule .",
    "our studies are motivated by the fact that this molecule represents the large class of important species where the permanent dipole moment does not coincide with any of the three principal axes of polarizability .",
    "experimentally we showed that the combination of an elliptically polarized laser pulse and a weak static electric field , not coinciding with either the major or the minor polarization axis of the light field , leads to 3d alignment of the molecule and 1d orientation of the most polarizable axis along the major polarization axis .",
    "the experiment is not capable of determining whether the second most polarizable axis is also oriented along the minor polarization axis but our calculation shows that it should be the case .",
    "this situation represents the most comprehensive degree of rotational control and is termed complete 3d orientation .",
    "if the elliptically polarized pulse is polarized such that the major ( minor ) polarization axis is parallel to the static field the molecule is 3d aligned and only the most ( second most ) polarizable axis is 1d oriented .",
    "furthermore , our calculations showed that complete 3d orientation can also be achieved using a linearly polarized laser pulse and a strong dc electric field arranged under an angle similar to the angle between the most polarizable axis and the dipole moment .",
    "overall , it is clear that mixed - field orientation with appropriately polarized laser fields and weak dc fields is an effective tool for confining how complex molecules are turned in space .",
    "even stronger control will be achievable in upcoming experiments combining strong dc electric fields and linearly - polarized laser fields .",
    "the degree of angular control demonstrated provides excellent prospects for the recording of molecular movies of complex molecules using ion- , electron- , or photon - imaging experiments .",
