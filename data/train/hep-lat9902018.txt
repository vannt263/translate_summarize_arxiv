    "with the progress over the last few years of quenched simulations of qcd , it has become increasingly clear that the quenched hadron spectrum shows deviations from the experiment if examined at a precision better than 510% . for light hadrons",
    "the first indication was that the strange quark mass can not be set consistently from pseudo scalar and vector meson channels in quenched qcd @xcite . for heavy quark systems calculations both with relativistic @xcite and non - relativistic @xcite quark actions",
    "have shown that the fine structure of quarkonium spectra can not be reproduced on quenched gluon configurations .",
    "most recently an extensive calculation by the cp - pacs collaboration found a systematic departure of both the light meson and baryon spectra from experiment @xcite .",
    "these results raise the question as to whether the discrepancies can be accounted for by the inclusion of dynamical sea quarks .",
    "it is therefore timely to study more thoroughly the effects of full qcd in order to answer this question .",
    "full qcd simulations are , however , computationally much more expensive than those of quenched qcd .",
    "simple scaling estimates coupled with past experience place a hundred - fold or more increase in the amount of computations for full qcd compared to that of quenched qcd with current algorithms .",
    "since @xmath3 is a typical maximal lattice size for quenched qcd which can be simulated with high statistics on computers with a speed in the 10 gflops range @xcite , reliable full qcd results are difficult to obtain on lattice sizes exceeding @xmath3 even with tflops - class computers such as cp - pacs @xcite and qcdsp @xcite . recalling that a physical lattice size of @xmath43.0  fm is needed to avoid finite - size effects @xcite , the smallest lattice spacing one can reasonably reach at present is therefore @xmath5  gev .",
    "hence lattice discretization errors have to be controlled through simulations carried out at inverse lattice spacings below this value , _",
    "e.g. _ in the range @xmath6  gev .",
    "it is , however , known that with the standard plaquette and wilson quark actions discretization errors are already of order 10% even for @xmath5  gev .",
    "these observations suggest the use of improved actions for simulations of full qcd .",
    "studies of improved actions have been widely pursued in the last few years .",
    "detailed tests of improvement for the hadron spectrum , however , have been carried out mostly within quenched qcd @xcite with only a few full qcd attempts @xcite . in particular , a systematic investigation of how gauge and quark action improvement , taken separately , affects light hadron observables has not been carried out in full qcd . prior to embarking on a large scale simulation ,",
    "we examine this question as the first subject of the full qcd program on the cp - pacs computer .    for a systematic comparison of action",
    "improvement we employ four possible types of action combinations , the standard plaquette or a renormalization - group improved action @xcite for the gauge part , and the standard wilson or the improvement of sheikholeslami and wohlert @xcite for the quark part .",
    "since effects of improvement are clearer to discern at coarser lattice spacings , we carry out simulations at an inverse lattice spacing of @xmath7  gev with quark masses in the range corresponding to @xmath80.9 . results for the four action combinations are used for comparative tests of improvement on the light hadron spectrum and the static quark potential .    another limiting factor for full qcd simulations",
    "is how close one can approach the chiral limit with present computing power . to investigate this question we take the action in which both gauge and quark parts are improved , and carry out simulations down to a quark mass corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to exploring the chiral behavior of hadron masses , this simulation allows an examination of signs of string breaking in the static quark - antiquark potential .    in this article",

    "the discretization error of the standard plaquette gauge action is @xmath10 while that of the wilson quark action is @xmath11 . in principle",
    "one would only need to improve the quark action to the same order as the gauge action . on the other hand ,",
    "violations of rotational invariance have been found to be strong for the plaquette gauge action at coarse lattice spacings @xcite . hence improving the gauge action is still advantageous for coarse lattices . in this spirit",
    "we employ ( besides the standard actions ) improved actions both in the gauge and quark sectors in the forms specified below .",
    "let us denote the standard plaquette gauge action by .",
    "improving this action requires the addition of wilson loops with a perimeter of six links or more .",
    "the number , the precise form and the coefficients of the added terms differ depending on the principle one follows for the improvement @xcite . in this study",

    "the degree of improvement is similar to those observed for tadpole - improved and fixed point actions @xcite .    to improve the quark action",

    "the leading discretization error in physical quantities is @xmath32 .",
    "the magnitude of the coefficients of this term should be reduced in the cases of ( b ) and ( c ) as compared to ( a ) .",

    ". hence the pmf value of the clover coefficient is similar to the mf value employed in ( b ) .",
    "the advantage of the pmf choice is that it does not require a self - consistent tuning of @xmath27 for each choice of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "the detailed numbers are again given in appendix  [ appendix : param ] .",
    "we calculate quark propagators for the hopping parameter equal to that for the dynamical quarks used in the configuration generation .",
    "two quark propagators are prepared for each configuration , one with the point source and the other with an exponentially smeared source with the smearing function @xmath62 . for the latter we fix the gauge configuration to the coulomb gauge .",
    "the choice of the smearing parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 is guided by previous quenched results for the pion wave function @xcite , readjusted by hand so that hadron effective masses reach a plateau as soon as possible .",
    "hadron propagators are constructed by combining quark propagators for the point ( p ) or the smeared ( s ) sources in various ways , but always adopting the point sink .",
    "for example , ps represents a meson propagator calculated with the point source for quark and the smeared source for antiquark . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - mass ] we show a typical example of effective masses for a variety of source combinations .    in most cases the effective masses for the ss ( sss for baryons )",
    "propagators comes from below , show the best plateau behavior , and have the smallest statistical errors estimated with the jackknife procedure .",
    "we therefore determine hadron masses with a fit to ss ( sss ) hadron propagators , supplementing results for other source combinations as a guide in choosing the fit range .",
    "hadron masses are extracted from propagators by employing a single hyperbolic cosine fit for mesons and a single exponential fit for baryons .",
    "we use uncorrelated fits and determine the error with the jackknife method . while our runs of at most 1500 hmc trajectories are not really long enough to carry out detailed autocorrelation analysis , examining the bin size dependence of the estimated error indicates a bin size of 5 configurations or 25 hmc trajectories to be a reasonable choice , which we adopt for all of our error analyses .",

    "we find that noise generally dominates over the signal for @xmath75 .",
    "thus we set the upper limit of the fitting range to @xmath76 .",
    "since choosing the lower limit @xmath77 leads to an increase of @xmath78 by 310 times compared to the choice @xmath79 for most values of @xmath70 and simulation parameters , we fix the fitting range to be @xmath804 .    the statistical error of @xmath71 is estimated by the jackknife method .",
    "we find that a bin size of 30 hmc trajectories is generally sufficient to ensure stability of errors against bin size .",

    "we observe two features in this figure . in the first instance , for each action combination the baryon to vector meson mass ratio decreases as the coupling decreases .",
    "this is a well - known trend of scaling violation for wilson - type quark actions .",

    "[ fig : ape ] do not exactly coincide . in order to disentangle effects associated with action improvement from those of a finer lattice spacing for each action",
    ", we need to plot results at the same lattice spacing .",
    "one way to make such a comparison is to take a cross section of fig .",
    "[ fig : ape ] at a fixed value of @xmath96 and plot the resulting value of @xmath97 as a function of @xmath85 at that value of @xmath96 .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the  and  results lie almost on a single curve , while the  and  results , respectively using the mf and pmf value of @xmath27 , fall on a different , much flatter curve .",
    "this clearly shows that the improvement of the gauge action has little effect on decreasing the scaling violation in the baryon masses .",
    "the improvement is due to the use of the clover quark action for the  and  cases .",
    "an apparently better behavior of  results in fig .",
    "[ fig : ape ] compared to those for the  case is merely an effect of the finer lattice spacing of the former .",
    "we have commented in sec .",
    "[ sec : action ] that the values of @xmath27 for the mf and pmf cases are similar .",
    "this would explain why results for the  action with the mf value of @xmath27 and those for the  action with the pmf value of @xmath27 lie almost on a single curve . for both mf and pmf choices ,",

    "none of our potential data , which typically extends up to the distance of @xmath103  fm , show signs of such a behavior , but rather increase linearly . as we discuss in more detail in sec .",

    "[ fig : aperc19 ] . while errors are large , and may even be underestimated because of the shortness of the runs , we find it encouraging that the ratios exhibit a trend of following the phenomenological curve toward the experimental points as the quark mass decreases . if we use the chiral extrapolation described above for the results on the @xmath43 lattice , we obtain @xmath137 and @xmath138 at the physical ratio @xmath139 , which are less than 10% off the experimentally observed ratios of 1.223 and 1.603 , respectively , despite the coarse lattice spacing of @xmath140  fm .      we have mentioned in sec .  [",
    "sec : potential ] that our results for the static potential do not show signs of flattening , indicative of string breaking up to the distance of @xmath103  fm .",
    "similar results have been reported by other groups @xcite .",
    "a possible reason for these results is that potential data do not extend to large enough distances where string breaking becomes energetically favorable .",
    "another related possibility is that the dynamical quark masses , which in most cases correspond to @xmath141@xmath142 , are too heavy . with our runs on the @xmath43 lattice",
    "we can examine these points up to the distance of @xmath143  fm and for quark masses down to @xmath9 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vvsr.16x32 ] we plot our potential data obtained on the @xmath43 lattice at the lightest sea quark mass corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "we find that the potential increases linearly up to @xmath144  fm , without any clear signal of flattening .",
    "the situation is similar for our data at heavier sea quark masses .",
    "an interesting and crucial question here is whether the wilson loop operator has sufficient overlap with the ground state at large @xmath70 so that the potential in that state is reliably measured there @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cvsr ] we compare results for the overlap function @xmath72 for the full qcd run at @xmath9 with that obtained in a quenched run with the  gauge action on a @xmath145 lattice at @xmath146 ( @xmath7  gev ) @xcite . for the quenched run",
    "the overlap @xmath72 of the smeared wilson loop operator with the ground string state is effectively 100  % at all distances . for full qcd , on the other hand",
    ", @xmath72 significantly decreases as @xmath70 increases .",
    "such a behavior of @xmath72 is observed in all of our data including those taken with action choices other than .",
    "these results may be taken as a tantalizing hint that the wilson loop operator develops mixings with states other than a single string , possibly a pair of static - light mesons in full qcd .",
    "we leave further investigations of this interesting question for future studies .",
    "an important practical information in full qcd is the computer time needed for the approach to the chiral limit . in table",
    "[ tab : cputime ] we assemble the relevant numbers for our runs on the @xmath43 lattice .",
    "these runs have been performed on a partition of 256 nodes , which is 1/8 of the cp - pacs computer . for a partition of this size",
    ", our full qcd program , written in fortran with the matrix multiplication in the quark solver hand - optimized in the assembly language , sustains about 37% of the peak speed of 75 gflops . adding the cpu time per trajectory of table [ tab : cputime ]",
    ", we find that accumulating 5000 trajectories for each of the 6 hopping parameters for this lattice size would take about 160 days with the full use of the cp - pacs computer .",
    "carrying out such a simulation is certainly feasible . for larger lattice sizes such as @xmath147 , however , we would have to stop at @xmath134 since the run at @xmath135 alone increases the computer time by a factor two .",
    "let us add that the cpu time for a unit of hmc trajectory increases roughly proportional to @xmath148 for the 4 smallest quark masses .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed investigation of the effect of improving the gauge and the quark action in full qcd .",
    "we have found that the consequence of improving either of the actions is different depending on the observable examined .    for the light hadron spectrum the clover quark action with a mean - field improved coefficient",
    "drastically improves the scaling of hadron mass ratios . improving the gauge action , on the other hand ,",
    "has almost no influence in this aspect .",
    "the sw - clover action also has the good property that the physical scale determined from the vector meson mass and the string tension in the chiral limit of the sea quark are consistent already at scales @xmath7  gev , which is not the case with the wilson quark action .",
    "the results obtained in the present study suggest that a significant step toward a systematic full qcd simulation can be made with the present computing power using improved gauge and quark actions at relatively coarse lattice spacings of @xmath182  gev .",
