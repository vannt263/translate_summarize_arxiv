    ", the ratio of the bulk viscosity to the entropy density @xmath8 should have a maximum close to @xmath7 @xcite or might even diverge at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the minimum of @xmath6 at @xmath9 160 mev is close to the lower bound of a perfect fluid with @xmath10  @xcite for infinitely coupled supersymmetric yang - mills gauge theory ( based on the ads / cft duality conjecture ) .",
    "this suggests the ` hot qcd matter ' to be the ` most perfect fluid '  @xcite . on the other hand the transport studies in refs .",
    "@xcite have provided results for the shear and bulk viscosity as well as the electric conductivity that are very close to lattice qcd results , however , employ the notion of a strongly interacting gas of quasiparticles with a dynamically generated mass that is sufficiently larger than the width of their spectral functions .",

    "the spectral functions @xmath17 are antisymmetric in @xmath18 and normalized as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the dynamical quasiparticle mass ( i.e. pole mass ) and width of the spectral function for particle @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "we recall that the fourier transform of the spectral function @xmath33 is proportional to the commutator of the fields at different space - time point and its integration over energy @xmath34 ensures a proper quantization ( see below ) .",
    "this is of particular importance since a transport realization can only propagate quasiparticles within or on the lightcone @xcite .",
    "more importantly , in the dqpm spectral contributions are separated into time - like ( @xmath31 ) and space - like ( @xmath32 ) four - momentum parts and the additional question arises if the contributions separately conserve microcausality .",
    "the layout of our study is as follows : in section ii we briefly present the basic definitions and relations between retarded and advanced propagators and recall the analytic proof for microcausality in case of the spectral functions ( [ eq1]),([eq2]),([eq3 ] ) . in section",
    "iii the actual problem is set up for time - like ( @xmath31 ) and space - like ( @xmath32 ) four - momentum parts of the spectral function and its numerical realization .",
    "furthermore , we present the actual numerical results for strong coupling and investigate the aperiodic limit as well as the case @xmath35 .",
    "a summary and discussion of results is given in section iv .",
    "in this work we will concentrate on the model case of a massive scalar field coupled e.g. to an external fermion field ( @xmath36 with a vanishing three - current , i.e. the field equation @xmath37 where @xmath0 stands for the strength of the coupling ( e.g. @xmath38 ) .",

    "we recall , furthermore , that solutions of the kadanoff - baym equations @xcite for @xmath44- theory in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite have lead to spectral functions that are very close to ( [ eq1 ] ) also for strong coupling .      the integration over @xmath45 in ( [ eq5 ] )",
    "can be carried out by contour integration and the angular integration in three - momentum is straight forward . with @xmath46",
    "the remaining integral kernel reads ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 which has a singular contribution on the lightcone and a regular part on and within the lightcone .",
    "the remaining integration over @xmath49 gives for the retarded green - function ( using @xmath50 ) @xmath51 @xmath52 for @xmath53 . with @xmath54",
    "one arrives at the final result @xcite @xmath55 with @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the bessel function . in the actual calculations the @xmath58-distribution term on the lightcone will be subtracted and we will address the regular part ( [ regular1 ] ) including the overall exponential decay in time , i.e. @xmath59 we note in passing that the related results for massive vector fields and dirac fields read @xcite @xmath60 and @xmath61 eqs .",
    "( [ gv ] ) and ( [ gf ] ) demonstrate that it is sufficient to investigate microcausality for the scalar case since microcausality for the scalar field implies microcausality for the corresponding vector and fermion fields .",
    "the retarded green - function ( [ eq : theorieergebnis ] ) is close to the solution of the free massive klein - gordon - field except for the factor @xmath62 describing the decay of the propagator in time and the reduced mass @xmath46 that incorporates a downward shift of the mass @xmath63 as in case of the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "similar relations hold for the advanced green - function which is obtained by replacing @xmath64 and a multiplication by @xmath65 due to the opposite contour integration : @xmath66 following @xmath67 . in four - momentum space",
    "the advanced propagator is given by ( [ eq : g(p)algebraischgewonnen ] ) replacing @xmath0 by @xmath68 .",

    "the commutator between the fields at different space - time points can also be written as the difference of advanced and retarded propagators ( due to opposite signs of the imaginary parts in the propagators @xcite ) : @xmath70=i\\delta^{\\star}({x } ) = i\\left(g_{\\mathrm{av}}({x})-g_{\\mathrm{ret}}({x})\\right ) = : c(x ) .",
