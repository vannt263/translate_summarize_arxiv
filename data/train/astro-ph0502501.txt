    "the jets observed emanating from the nuclei of quasars and other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) represent the most energetic long - lived phenomenon in the universe .",
    "although jet imaging is no longer the sole prerogative of radio astronomy , the exquisite resolution of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) at radio wavelengths remains an unreached goal for sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) and shorter wavelengths .",
    "it is thought that accretion onto a black hole drives the jet outward via magnetic forces ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "currently , the most direct way to provide observational evidence for such a model is to study the linear polarization of jets at different frequencies ( from radio to optical ) along with changes in the innermost jet structure .",
    "the most promising objects in such investigations are blazars , flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars and bl  lac objects characterized by high optical polarization up to 46% @xcite , pronounced and rapid variability of flux , and one - sided jets with knots that move at superluminal apparent velocities , as fast as @xmath430@xmath5 @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "there is a highly significant correlation between optical polarization and dominance of a compact radio core - jet structure , which suggests beaming of the optical flux along with the radio emission .",
    "comparison of radio - loud quasars with low and high optical polarization shows a higher fractional polarization of the radio core for the latter @xcite , which implies a co - spatial origin of the emission at these wavelengths . in support of this , the optical polarization in blazars is affected by the formation and emergence of new vlbi knots @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that simultaneous multifrequency polarization monitoring , together with high resolution polarimetric imaging of the radio jets , provides a unique tool for identifying the location of the regions responsible for variability at different wavelengths and for relating the magnetic field geometry to the structure of the jet .",
    "we have obtained total and polarized intensity images of 15 agns with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 7  mm ( 43  ghz ) at 17 epochs over three years .",
    "the vlba observations are accompanied at many epochs by nearly simultaneous ( within two weeks ) measurements of polarization at 1.35/0.85 mm ( 230/350  ghz ) and at optical wavelengths . in the second half of the program simultaneous polarization observations at 3  mm",
    "were performed at several epochs .",
    "the main goals of the project are to relate emission regions at high frequencies to the parsec - scale jet structure and to investigate the strength , direction , and variability of the magnetic field close to the central engine .",
    "these can be achieved only after detailed study of the jet kinematics .",
    "this paper is devoted to an analysis of the jet structure and its variability associated with ejection and propagation of disturbances down the jet , which appear on radio maps as knots of enhanced brightness .",
    "the paper is the first in a series based on the entire data set collected during the project .",
    "some results on individual sources have been published already by ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  120 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bl  lac ) , and ( * ? ? ? *  279 ) .",
    "other papers will include ( 1 ) comparison of the polarization parameters at different frequencies with the jet structure and disturbances in the jet ; ( 2 ) analysis of the available radio , sub - mm , optical , and x - ray light curves to relate the flux variability to activity in the jet ; ( 3 ) results regarding stability of the vlbi core position based on phase - referencing observations obtained for five sources in the sample ; and ( 4 ) structure of the core and intraday total and polarized intensity variability in the parsec - scale jets .",
    "although much progress has been made in studying the kinematics of jets since the vlba started to operate fully in 1995 @xcite , our program is unique regarding the number of sources observed in such detail over a rather long period of time .",
    "this allows us to separate the fast and slow , ballistic and curved motion in the jet flow , define physical parameters for both individual jet features and entire parsec - scale jets , and compare the results across different classes of agns .",
    "our program is designed for comparison of the linear polarization at high frequencies ( mm , sub - mm , and optical wavelengths ) with the parsec scale jet structure of agns .",
    "this has defined the main criteria for selecting the sample and frequency of our vlba observations :    1 .",
    "the sources should be bright , @xmath60.5  jy , and polarized , @xmath63% , at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "the size of the sample and brightness of sources should allow us to perform vlba observations at a single epoch during 24 hours with sufficient uv - coverage to produce total and polarized intensity images at 43  ghz with high dynamic range .",
    "3 .   the sample should contain sources with resolved radio structure from different sub - classes of agns for which variability in the jet flow can be expected on timescales of months .",
    "the sources should be convenient for monitoring in the northern hemisphere and their coordinates should cover the whole range of right ascensions .",
    "following these constraints , we have formed a sample of 15 agns that consists of 8 quasars , 5 bl  lac objects , and 2 radio galaxies ( 3c  120 of fanaroff - riley type 1 and 3c  111 of type 2 ) after obtaining information on the linear polarization at sub - mm wavelengths from @xcite .",
    "the sources are listed in table [ sample ] .",
    "we have observed the objects in our sample in four different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum : at 43  ghz ( 7 mm ) with the vlba , at 350/230  ghz ( 0.85/1.3  mm ) with the _ james clerk maxwell telescope _",

    "( bima , hat creek , california ) .",
    "the observations were performed from 1998 march to 2001 april .",
    "the vlba monitoring was carried out roughly bimonthly ( 17 epochs ) .",
    "for the jcmt and optical observations the number of epochs depends on the source , with the maximum being 11 and seven epochs and the minimum five and three epochs , respectively , except for the bl  lac object 1803 + 784 , which was not observed in the optical region owing an inaccessibly high declination .",
    "the majority of the jcmt polarization observations were accompanied by total flux measurements .",
    "differential @xmath9-band photometry ( @xmath10-band photometry in the case of 3c  273 ) was carried out when conditions were photometric .",
    "the bima polarization observations started in 2000 april and for many sources in the sample were performed simultaneously with the vlba observations at 3 - 4 epochs .",
    "however , each of these epochs usually was accompanied by a series of bima observations separated by several days so that for some sources polarization measurements at 3  mm were obtained at 20 epochs .",
    "the polarization data at 3  mm include all four stokes parameters . in this paper",
    "the optical , jcmt , and bima polarization results are shown only graphically to illustrate the data collected .",
    "detailed descriptions of the data reduction and tables of measurements will be presented in a later paper .",
    "the 43  ghz observations were carried out with the vlba recording system using eight 8 mhz wide channels , each in right and left circular polarization , with 15 - 20 scans of 3 - 5 minute duration for each object .",
    "all 10 antennas were used for each source except at epochs affected by weather or receiver failure .",
    "table [ antenna ] lists the antennas operated at each epoch and typical parameters of the synthesized beam ( those of the oj 287 observations ) for uniform weighting ( used for imaging all sources ) to illustrate the consistency of the @xmath11-coverage over epochs .",
    "initial correlation was carried out at the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) array operations center in socorro , nm .",
    "subsequent calibration was performed with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software supplied by nrao , while images were made with the caltech software difmap @xcite .",
    "the calibration included application of the nominal antenna - based gain curves and system temperatures , and correction for sky opacity , followed by iterative imaging plus phase and amplitude self - calibration .",
    "for each epoch we calculated the total flux density in the images of sources that are known to have very weak emission outside the angular size range of the vlba images ( 0420 - 014 , 0528 + 134 , oj 287 , and bl  lac ) .",
    "these values were compared with total flux densities obtained by interpolating in time the measurements of the monitoring program at 37 ghz at the metshovi research station , finland @xcite .",
    "the comparison produced the flux density correction factors , @xmath12 , given in table [ antenna ] .",
    "the factors were applied for the final adjustment of the flux density scale in the images . we have constructed light curves of the vlbi core for each source to confirm the absence of correlation between their behavior , indicating no evidence for residual amplitude calibration errors .",
    "the light curves of the 15 sources peak at 9 different epochs and the correlation coefficients are spread between @xmath130.4 and + 0.3 , consistent with no systematic calibration errors in the flux density scaling .",
    "we performed a cross - hand fringe fit using a scan of 3c  279 averaged over all baselines ( the data were corrected for parallactic angle rotation of phases in advance ) .",
    "the resulting right - left phase and rate delay corrections were processed with the aips task polsn and applied to the full data set .",
    "after preliminary images were produced , the images were used in aips task calib to self - calibrate the phases of all sources ; this includes the removal of residual r - l phase differences owing to calibration errors .",
    "the instrumental polarization `` d - terms '' were determined via the method of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a final set of d - terms at each epoch was obtained by averaging of the solutions for those sources in the sample for which there is the best agreement between the d - terms ( usually , 3c  111 , oj  287 , 3c  345 , and bl  lac ) . the electric vector position angle ( evpa ) calibration was obtained by different methods : comparison between the very large array ( vla ) and vlba integrated evpas at quasi - simultaneous epochs , d - terms method ( see below ) , and using evpa - stable features in the images of the jets of 3c  279 , oj 287 , and cta102 . over the period 1998 march  1999 february we used results of the vla observations performed for 0420@xmath13014 , 3c  120 , oj 287 , 3c  279 , bl  lac , and 3c  454.3 by @xcite .",
    "later we obtained polarization measurements for 0420@xmath13014 , 0528 + 134 , oj 287 , and 1803 + 784 at two epochs , 2000 april and 2000 july , with the vla @xmath14 and @xmath15 configuration , respectively . at epochs where vla data were not available we used the d - terms method , which is based on the assumption that the instrumental polarization parameters change slowly with time @xcite . a detailed description of the method is given in @xcite .",
    "in addition , later we checked our calibration for these epochs using the nrao data base at * http://www.vla.nrao.edu/astro/calib/polar/ * for sources 0420@xmath13014 , 0528 + 134 , oj287 , and bl  lac when the nrao data were available at epochs close to the vlba dates .",
    "the results are completely consistent with our calibration .",
    "the evpa - stable feature in 3c  279 is the well - known superluminal component @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which underwent a change in evpa in the beginning of 1998 @xcite but maintained this evpa until the end of our program .",
    "the evpa - stable features in oj  287 and cta  102 are quasi - stationary components at @xmath71  mas and @xmath72  mas from the core , respectively .",
    "however , these both became very weak in the second half of 2000 in the 43  ghz images .",
    "the final evpa calibration is a result of the best agreement among the different methods .",
    "the accuracy of the calibrated evpa measurements , @xmath17(evpa ) , is indicated in table [ antenna ] .",
    "we have combined the images obtained for every source in a sequence of total intensity maps convolved with the same beam , corresponding to the average beam during the epochs when all 10 antennas were in operation .",
    "the contours are in terms of the global peak of the maximum total intensity observed over all epochs .",
    "the sequences are presented in figures [ alla]-[allo ] , which also show the jcmt , bima , and optical polarization measurements .",
    "all images are oriented with north toward the top and east toward the left .",
    "the scale in mas is indicated along one of the axes , while the epoch of each image is given along the other axis .",
    "the peaks of the total , @xmath18 , and polarized , @xmath19 , intensity , parameters of the average beam , the total intensity of the lowest contour , @xmath20 , and the lowest level of the polarized intensity , @xmath21 , of the combined maps are indicated in table [ sample ] .",
    "the polarization at 7  mm is shown inside the total intensity images by line segments , which are plotted if the local polarized intensity exceeds @xmath21 .",
    "the segments are oriented in the local direction of the polarization and their length is proportional to the local polarized intensity , with the maximum length corresponding to the global peak of the polarized intensity over all epochs , @xmath19 .",
    "table [ antenna ] marks epochs when the bima , jcmt , and optical observations were performed within two weeks of the corresponding vlba epoch .",
    "we employed the task modelfit in difmap to represent each total intensity image ( stokes parameter @xmath22 ) as a sequence of circular gaussian components that are characterized by flux density , size , and position relative to the map center .",
    "initially , point - like components are used to obtain an image with 100:1 dynamic range .",
    "when a set of point - like components was found , a final group of 100 iterations was executed with all parameters of all components allowed to vary to define their properties .",
    "in addition , because we have roughly bimonthly observations , we repeated the model fitting with the components from the previous epoch used as the initial model ( except for the first epoch , 1998 march ) .",
    "this improves identification of components over epochs and provides an estimate of the accuracy of the parameters by comparison of the outcomes obtained with different initial models . for several sources ( 3c  66a ,",
    "oj 287 , 3c  279 , pks  1510@xmath13089 , and 1803 + 784 ) at four epochs ( 1998 march 1998 , 1999 october , 2000 july 2000 , and 2001 january ) we derived estimates of the 1@xmath17 uncertainties of the best - fit models using the method described by @xcite and realized in the package difwrap @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties depend significantly on the brightness and size of components : 1 ) for _ bright _ ( flux of knot @xmath23 noise level ) and _ compact _ ( size @xmath240.1  mas ) features , uncertainties in flux density @xmath71% , in position @xmath70.01  mas , and in size @xmath25 1% ; 2 ) for the majority of components with size 0.1 - 0.3  mas and flux @xmath650  mjy , uncertainties in the flux density @xmath73% , in position @xmath71/5 of the beam size , and in size @xmath75% ; 3 ) for diffuse components , uncertainties in flux density @xmath710% , in position are comparable with half the size of the knot , and in size @xmath710% ; 4 ) for components weaker than 50  mjy , uncertainties in flux density @xmath750% and positional uncertainties correspond to the size of the average beam ( see table [ sample ] ) ; however , for the majority of weak components these uncertainties were later modified as discussed in  4 ( errors of polynomial parameters ) .",
    "we determined the parameters of polarized components by applying the task modelfit to the @xmath11-data in stokes parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 separately .",
    "for this purpose only point - like components were used in the models . because the q and u components can be either positive or negative , the procedure needs to be carried out carefully by checking with the polarized intensity image to avoid the inclusion of false features generated by the imaging procedure .",
    "the derived positional parameters of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 components were compared with the parameters of @xmath22 components .",
    "we consider a @xmath26 and/or @xmath27 component to be associated with an @xmath22 component if they are co - spatial to within the uncertainties .",
    "if both polarized components are present , the position of the polarized component is defined by the average location , weighted by the absolute values of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 fluxes .",
    "there are few cases when a significant polarized component does not have an @xmath22 counterpart .",
    "uncertainties in the values of the parameters of polarized components are difficult to define .",
    "estimates of the accuracy of polarization parameters in jet features at 15 and 22  ghz are discussed by @xcite . for components that are bright in the total intensity and highly polarized ( percent polarization @xmath285% )",
    ", we find that the uncertainties in fractional polarization @xmath29% and in polarization angle @xmath30 .",
    "a table of parameters of jet features for each source over all epochs can be found at the web - site * www.bu.edu / blazars / multi.html*. the columns of these tables are as follows : 1 - epoch , 2 - flux density in jy , 3 - relative right ascension in mas , 4 - relative declination in mas , 5 - distance from the core in mas , 6 - position angle relative to the core in degrees , 7 - angular size in mas , 8 - polarized flux density of a polarized component associated with a total intensity component , in jy , 9 - distance of polarized component from the core in mas , 10 - position angle of polarized component relative to the core in degrees , 11 - evpa in degrees .",

    "although this might be the case for average apparent speeds derived from surveys at different wavelengths , for individual sources with superluminal components detected at similar distances at different frequencies , the effect can be caused by the structure containing the leading perturbation plus slower trailing shocks being unresolved at the longer wavelengths .",

    "the sequences of images reveal short timescales ( for some sources shorter than 2 months ) of variability of the jet structure and even more rapid variability in polarization .",

    "we have measured the apparent speed of 106 features in the inner jets ( within 4  mas of the core ) of two radio galaxies , five bl lac objects , and eight quasars from 1998 march to 2001 april .",
    "superluminal apparent speeds occur in 80% of the knots , 26% of which show statistically significant deviations from ballistic motion .",
    "the majority of non - ballistic components undergo an increase of apparent speed with distance from the core , although local decelerations are observed in some cases alongside the general acceleration",
    ". this could be the result of physical accelerations or from selection of sources whose angles to the line of sight @xmath208 near the core and closer to this value farther out .",
    "many of the jets contain both very fast and much slower moving features , which might be explained as forward and reverse shocks , respectively .",
    "it appears that fast features are pronounced in the jets of the quasars , while slower moving knots dominate in the bl  lac jets .",
    "this suggests a different nature of the main disturbances seen in the jets of the two classes of blazars .",
    "the properties of 11% of the superluminal components are consistent with the characteristics of trailing shocks expected to form in the wake of strong disturbances in the flow . trailing components emerging from bright knots farther down the jet have a faster apparent speed than those generated near the core while a given trailing feature most likely decelerates along the jet . according to the numerical simulations by @xcite ,",
    "the trailing components are caused by the triggering of pinch modes by the main disturbance .",
    "the jet accelerates close to the core as internal energy is converted into bulk kinetic energy , leading to trailing shocks being faster farther downstream .    in four sources ( 3c  120 , oj  287 , 3c  345 , and cta  102 ) the behavior of jet components appears to be affected by the interaction with the external medium (",
    "see  a ) . for each source",
    "a number of components decelerate , change trajectory , brighten in total and polarized flux , and undergo a rotation of the evpa at the same distance from the core along an edge of the jet .",
    "this implies the existence of gas clouds a few parsecs to @xmath2021  kpc ( deprojected ) from the central engine , intermediate between the locations of the very dense clouds of the broad line regions and more rarefied clouds of the narrow line regions .",
    "using measurements from the vlbi images of parameters such as flux density , apparent speed , and size of components , we have estimated lorentz and doppler factors as well as viewing angles for superluminal knots and the opening angle of each jet .",
    "this is a new method to define jet parameters , based on the assumption that the decay in flux of the superluminal components is caused by radiative losses rather than by cooling from expansion , and is subject to light - travel delays .",
    "we demonstrate that at high radio frequencies these assumptions are most likely correct .",
    "the derived parameters of the jets indicate that in our sample the quasars have the highest doppler factors ( @xmath164 ) and smallest viewing ( @xmath100 ) and opening ( @xmath131 ) angles , while the two radio galaxies possess significantly lower doppler factors , larger viewing angles , and wider opening angles despite their `` blazar - like '' radio properties .",
    "this implies that in the 3-dimensional parameter space ( @xmath164,@xmath100,@xmath131 ) the radio galaxies , bl  lacs , and quasars in our sample occupy different regions .",
    "the regions of the quasars and bl  lac objects partly overlap , while the radio galaxies are significantly distinguished from the blazars in all three parameters . since our sample is not a complete one , the major differences suggested by these results need to be investigated further with larger , complete samples .",
    "the inferred relationship between the half opening angle and the lorentz factor agrees with the expectation of gas - dynamic models that predict smaller values of @xmath131 for higher lorentz factors and a dependence of @xmath131 on the ratio of the external and internal jet pressure .",
    "the best approximation to the relation is very close to @xmath209 .",
    "this does not , however , exclude collimation by magnetic pinching , which might produce a similar @xmath210 relation .",

    "comparison of these values with the equipartition brightness temperature of the optically thick part of the jets , @xmath214  k , suggests a stronger magnetic field in the bl  lac objects .    there is a possible positive correlation between the lorentz factor of the jet and ejection rate of superluminal components for the blazars",

    "the absence of proper motion within each data set suggests that the observed difference in position of the feature ( @xmath70.2  mas in declination and @xmath70.1  mas in right ascension ) could be caused by a displacement to the northeast of the vlbi core between 1997.6 and 1998.2 . beyond @xmath14 ,",
