    "<S> the compatibility between the qcd analytic invariant charge and chiral symmetry breaking is examined in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling in question incorporates asymptotic freedom and infrared enhancement into a single expression , and contains only one adjustable parameter with dimension of mass . when inserted into the standard form of the quark gap - equation it gives rise to solutions displaying singular confining behavior at the origin . by relating these solutions to the pion decay constant , </S>",
    "<S> a rough estimate of about @xmath0mev is obtained for the aforementioned mass - scale . </S>",
    "<S> -1 mm    as has been advocated in recent years by a number of authors  @xcite , a possible way for gaining further insight on the infrared sector of qcd is to resort to arguments based on the analyticity of the underlying dynamics , as captured by the corresponding dispersion relations . jointly with the renormalization group formalism </S>",
    "<S> , these relations constitute the essential ingredients of the so - called `` analytic approach ''  @xcite to quantum field theory ( some applications of this method can be found in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most celebrated applications of this approach to qcd is related to the running coupling . in particular , one is able to extrapolate the behavior of the strong coupling from the ultraviolet region towards the infrared regime , by imposing requirements of analyticity on it or on its derivative  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , if we apply such ideas on the perturbative expansion for the one - loop @xmath1  function , the solution for the analytic invariant charge that emerges assumes the form  @xcite @xmath2 the invariant charge  ( [ aic1l ] ) has the correct analytic properties in the @xmath3  variable , i.e. , unlike its perturbative counterpart , it displays no landau pole . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it has no adjustable parameters other than a mass - scale , to be denoted by @xmath4 , emerging , as usual , through the standard mechanism of dimensional transmutation </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the coupling of  ( [ aic1l ] ) incorporates asymptotic freedom and infrared enhancement into a single expression ( see figure  [ plot : aic ] ) . regarding this last point , </S>",
    "<S> the invariant charge  ( [ aic1l ] ) has been shown to generate the confining static quark - antiquark potential with a quasilinear raising behavior at large distances ; specifically @xmath5 when @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the dimensionless distance between quark and antiquark ) . </S>",
    "<S> further appealing features of the analytic running coupling  ( [ aic1l ] ) and its applications can be found in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> evidently , it would be interesting to further scrutinize the advantages and possible limitations of the analytic charge in the region where it aspires to make a difference , namely the infrared sector of qcd .    ) and the perturbative running coupling at the one - loop level ( solid and dashed curves , respectively).,width=283 ]    -7.5 mm    chiral symmetry breaking  ( csb ) and dynamical mass generation are inherently non - perturbative effects , whose study in the continuum leads almost invariably to a treatment based on the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known to the sd experts , the form of the solutions obtained depends crucially on the way one chooses to model the qcd running coupling at low energies . in this talk </S>",
    "<S> we summarize results presented in  @xcite on the impact of the analytic invariant charge  @xcite on csb . </S>",
    "<S> this is accomplished by studying the solutions that emerge from the standard gap equation governing the quark propagator , when the aforementioned model for the infrared behavior of the qcd coupling is adopted .    </S>",
    "<S> we next proceed to the study of the gap equation . according to the standard lore , </S>",
    "<S> the starting point is to express the fully dressed quark propagator in the following general form  @xcite @xmath8 we consider the case without explicit csb , i.e. , bare mass @xmath9 , and the quark mass is generated exclusively through dynamical effects </S>",
    "<S> . then csb takes place when the self - energy @xmath10 develops a non - zero value . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally one defines the quark mass function @xmath11 in terms of the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as @xmath14 ; then csb occurs when @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the quark self - energy , which is represented schematically in figure  [ self ] , can be written as @xmath16 where we have used that @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the gell - mann matrices , and @xmath19 . according to this equation , the self - energy @xmath10 is dynamically determined in terms of itself , the full gluon propagator , denoted by @xmath20 , and the full quark - gluon vertex  @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , both @xmath22 and @xmath21 obey their own complicated sd equation , a fact which eventually makes unavoidable the use of simplifications and further modeling of the unknown functions involved .    ) for the quark self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> the black blobs represent the fully dressed quark and gluon propagators and the white one is the proper quark - gluon vertex.,width=283 ]    -7.5 mm    the first step toward a construction of a manageable system of equations is to ignore the ghost contributions in the quark sd equation . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are contained in the full gluon propagator and the full quark - gluon vertex . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the full quark - gluon vertex should satisfy the slavnov - taylor identity @xmath23 = & & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-45 mm } = \\left[1-b(k , q)\\right]s^{-1}(p ) - s^{-1}(q)\\left[1-b(k , q)\\right]\\ ! , \\label{slavnov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the ghost self - energy and @xmath25 is the ghost - quark scattering kernel . without ghosts , </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ slavnov ] ) becomes identical to the text - book qed ward identity @xcite , and the quark - gluon vertex now obeys @xmath26 this last ward identity enforces the equality @xmath27 between the vertex- and quark - wave - function renormalization constants , exactly as happens in qed . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , in this treatment we are effectively assuming a theory with abelian - like characteristics , where it is hoped that the form of the effective gluon propagator employed retains some memory of the omitted ghost effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the next step is to employ a `` gauge technique '' inspired ansatz  @xcite for the unknown vertex @xmath28 . according to this technique , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 is written in terms of @xmath29 in such way as to satisfy _ by construction _ </S>",
    "<S> the ward identity  ( [ ward ] ) . clearly , this procedure introduces the additional ambiguity of how to fix the transverse part of the vertex , which may lead in higher orders to mishandling of the overlapping divergences , but is expected to be of little consequence in the infrared . in the following analysis we will use for @xmath28 the simple ansatz proposed in references  @xcite @xmath30{\\slash \\hspace{-0.18cm}}{q } + \\!\\left[b(p^2)-b(q^2)\\right]\\!\\bigr\\}.   \\label{vert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] another important consequence of the forced `` abelianization '' imposed on the theory establishes finally the required link between the gap equation and the effective qcd charge . in particular , since now @xmath27 , one may define a _ renormalization - group - invariant quantity _ </S>",
    "<S> , to be denoted by @xmath31 , which is the exact analogue of the qed effective charge , namely @xmath32 choosing the _ landau gauge _ leads to the further simplification @xmath33 since , in that case , the gluon propagator is completely transverse .    substituting equations  ( [ qprop ] ) and  ( [ prod ] ) into the quark gap equation  ( [ senergy ] ) , one arrives at </S>",
    "<S> the commonly used coupled system for the the quark self - energy in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last necessary step in order to set up our final quark sd equation is to employ the usual _ </S>",
    "<S> angular approximation _ , which allows to handle the dependence on the angle appearing in the arguments of the various functions entering into the gap equation . </S>",
    "<S> even though the robustness of this approximation has been occasionally put into doubt ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , it offers the major advantage of reducing the coupled system to one single equation , since it automatically forces the relation @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can straightforwardly relate @xmath13 to the dynamical mass  @xmath11 : @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the invariant charge @xmath31 lies in the heart of the above equation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , after the succession of simplifications listed above , it is the sole ingredient which remains to be modeled . </S>",
    "<S> it is at this point that the _ analytic _ </S>",
    "<S> charge @xmath39 of  ( [ aic1l ] ) will enter into the game , being plugged into equation  ( [ sde ] ) as our model for the qcd effective charge @xmath31 .    before solving the resulting integral equation numerically </S>",
    "<S> , we can infer some qualitative conclusions about the deep infrared behavior of the solutions by differentiating both sides twice with respect to @xmath40 ( see also references  @xcite ) , thus converting  ( [ sde ] ) into a differential equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation may be solved iteratively ; the first iteration , corresponding to the leading infrared behavior of the dynamical mass function @xmath43 , is obtained by omitting the second - order derivative in equation  ( [ ndif ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the solution is @xmath44 the above approximate solution presents a singular behavior in the low - energy region , which can be interpreted as a hint for confinement ( see additional discussion in references  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as for the ultraviolet behavior of the solution , the conservation of the axial - vector current eventually leads , for sufficient large momenta , to @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the anomalous dimension of the mass , and @xmath47 is a constant independent of the renormalization point and directly related to the quark condensate ( see also review  @xcite and references therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> , obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sde ] ) using the one - loop analytic charge  ( [ aic1l ] ) for @xmath48 active flavors.,width=283 ]    -7.5 mm    the dynamical quark mass function @xmath43 , obtained solving numerically the integral equation  ( [ sde ] ) , is presented in figure  [ csb-1aic ] . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one can see a soft enhancement of @xmath43 when @xmath49 , as forecasted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lead ] ) . in order to restore a physical scale in the dimensionless mass function @xmath43 , one has to relate the obtained solution to a qcd observable . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this can be accomplished by making use of the method developed by pagels , stokar  @xcite , and cornwall  @xcite , which provides the required link between @xmath43 and the pion decay constant : @xmath50\\!\\ ! \\frac{y{\\mathcal m}(y)\\ , dy}{\\left[y+{\\mathcal m}^2(y)\\right]^2}. \\label{fpim}\\ ] ] thus , the scale parameter @xmath4 ( which is the only adjustable parameter within the approach at hand ) can be evaluated by requiring the right - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fpim ] ) to acquire the experimental value of the pion decay constant @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , for the case of @xmath48 active flavors , this results in estimate @xmath52mev . </S>",
    "<S> the higher loop corrections to the analytic running coupling @xmath53  @xcite do not alter qualitatively the picture obtained . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the confining behavior of the dynamical mass function @xmath43 persists , but the infrared singularity displayed is weaker than that of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lead ] ) . in turn , this further elevates the estimate of the scale parameter  @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion that we draw from the above analysis is that the analytic invariant charge developed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the sd equations may coexist in a complementary and qualitatively consistent picture , and that the obtained value for the only free parameter turns out to be in the right ballpark . </S>"
