    "over the past decade , photonic quantum information processing@xcite has shown considerable promise for quantum computing@xcite , communication@xcite and metrology@xcite .",
    "most of the impressive proof - of - principle demonstrations have relied on bulk optics@xcite that is inherently non scalable@xcite .",
    "independent progress on conventional integrated photonic circuitry@xcite suggests that integrated quantum photonic circuits@xcite may offer a scalable solution .",
    "a variety of pertinent host material systems@xcite are being studied , but the unparalleled recent progress in classical silicon - based photonic circuits@xcite makes silicon particularly attractive .",
    "phase modulators and a wide assortment of ultra - compact ( tunable ) passive components have been demonstrated in the silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) platform@xcite .",
    "already some of these have been integrated@xcite with on - chip entangled and heralded photon sources@xcite , single photon detectors@xcite , and used to demonstrate quantum interference and manipulation@xcite .",
    "all the optical components on a soi platform - including the detectors - should operate at telecom compatible infrared wavelengths .",
    "superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspd)@xcite represent the most promising stand - alone infrared photon counting technology , and so it is not surprising that nanowires placed on top of optical waveguides have figured prominently in recent demonstrations of integrated single photon detectors@xcite . in the travelling wave ( tw ) configuration employed in these detectors , photons propagating down micron - wide waveguides are evanescently absorbed by a critically biased superconducting nanowire over a distance of tens of microns , and then an easily detectable normal state transition in the nanowire occurs@xcite .",
    "various of these tw snspds have achieved high quantum efficiencies ( up to 91%@xcite ) , or low noise ( down to @xmath50.01hz@xcite ) , or fast recovery time ( @xmath510ns@xcite ) , or accurate timing response ( @xmath520ps of jitter@xcite ) , but no integrated single detector performs well in all of these critical categories . if truly scalable quantum information on - a - chip is to become practical , then detectors that exceed all of these individual performance metrics are needed .",
    "the evanescent absorption in the tw geometry intrinsically puts a minimum on the coupling length of an efficient detector , and correspondingly , the length of the nanowire ( typically between 40@xmath0 m and 400@xmath0 m @xcite depending on the nanowire layout and the host material system ) . a higher packing density of lower noise@xcite , faster@xcite and more accurate detectors@xcite would be possible if the nanowire length could be further reduced .",
    "the obvious challenge is the apparent trade - off in absorption efficiency@xcite ( shorter wires offer less absorbing volume ) .",
    "this paper describes a successful strategy for circumventing this trade - off , by embedding a short ( 8.5@xmath0 m ) ultra - narrow ( 8@xmath135nm@xmath2 ) superconducting nanowire within a high quality factor microcavity specifically designed to turn the overall detector into a coherent perfect absorber@xcite ( see scanning electron microscope images on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . implemented on a soi platform",
    ", the detector s ultra small foot - print ( 0.5@xmath17.0@xmath0m@xmath2 ) - smaller than any reported to date - also incorporates a built - in optical filter .",
    "it absorbs and detects nearly 100% of @xmath31545 nm light in the waveguide while exhibiting a sub - hz intrinsic dark count rate , and a fast recovery time @xmath57ns .",
    "in order for a short nanowire to absorb virtually every photon incident along a waveguide , it is placed within an asymmetric optical microcavity defined by etching a series of holes on either side of the nanowire ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a ) .",
    "the cavity containing the weakly absorbing nanowire is designed to function as a coherent perfect absorber@xcite ( cpa ) .",
    "ideally ( ignoring all other losses ) , the reflectivity of the back mirror ( right side ) is unity , so all of the light incident from the left must be either absorbed or reflected . at the resonant frequency of the cavity , @xmath6 , a portion of the light incident from the left excites a resonating cavity mode with amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "the normalized power reflected back into the incident waveguide is then @xmath8 , and the power absorbed by the nanowire is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the time constants associated with the decay of @xmath7 into the waveguide and the nanowire , respectively@xcite .",
    "power conservation in this idealized scenario requires @xmath12 , which in general determines how much of the incident light reflects , and how much is transferred into the cavity .",
    "however , if the left side mirror reflectivity is designed such that @xmath13 , then all of the incident light is perfectly transferred to the cavity and absorbed . from a different perspective",
    ", the scattering matrix ( @xmath14 ) describing the dielectric mirrors and nanowire in a cpa - snspd is such that the incident photons excite the detector into an eigenvector of @xmath14 with eigenvalue equal to zero @xcite .        in the ideal scenario above , an arbitrarily short nanowire ( arbitrarily long @xmath11 ) can absorb all of the incident radiation as long as the reflectivity of the input mirror can be precisely tuned close to 100% ( i.e. long @xmath10 ) . in practice there will also be some additional scattering losses associated with the cavity , so its overall quality factor , @xmath15 will be given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the above analysis indicates that detectors with absorption efficiency @xmath19 , can be achieved using very short and narrow nanowires as long as dielectric reflectors can be designed such that @xmath20 .",
    "the minimum nanowire length ( @xmath21 ) is dictated by how tightly localized the high @xmath22 cavity mode is , and therefore high - index contrast host materials like soi are ideal . finally it is noted that this approach necessarily limits the bandwidth over which the detector absorbs efficiently , to @xmath23 .",
    "however , for many quantum information processing applications , optical filters are placed in front of detectors to minimize spurious counts due to stray photons@xcite .",
    "the cpa detector described here actually integrates the filter and detector into a single , compact unit .",
    "the cpa - snspds are formed by pattering holes in a silicon nanobeam ( silicon on sio@xmath24 , 190 nm thick , 500 nm wide ) to form an asymmetric cavity around a u - shaped nanowire ( nbtin , 8 nm thick , @xmath25 wide ) that lies on top of the nanobeam , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a .",
    "nanobeam cavities@xcite allow low - loss coupling to waveguides , high @xmath22 , low mode volume , and an accessible near field which are all useful features for cpa - snspds .",
    "the back ( perfect ) reflector consists of 10 holes , 6 of fixed radius ( @xmath26 ) and 4 with shrinking radii , down to @xmath27 , toward the input waveguide to impedance match the bloch mode to the waveguide mode .",
    "the front ( partial ) reflector has @xmath28 holes , all of which are linearly tapered from a maximum hole radius of @xmath29 down to @xmath27 on both sides .",
    "these 1d photonic crystals@xcite were designed ( see simulation methods ) to have a band - gap centered at 1545 nm . to design the cpa , @xmath30 and @xmath31 nm",
    "are fixed , and the cavity length ( @xmath32 ) in the absence of the nanowire is adjusted to get a mode at the detector operation wavelength of 1545 nm with a moderate @xmath33 .",
    "this ensures appropriate design of tapers and consequently a high enough @xmath34 .",
    "when the nanowire is added to the same cavity , the mode profile and wavelength stay almost fixed , but the new @xmath35 is substantially reduced , even for the smallest @xmath36 ( see squares on fig .  [ fig:2]b ) . removing the nanowire and reducing @xmath29 and @xmath28 results in a new set of @xmath37 , with magnitudes comparable with @xmath38 ( see circles on fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b ) . a nanowire with a certain @xmath25 ( e.g. vertical dashed line on fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b ) and thus fixed @xmath39 ( horizontal dashed line ) will perfectly absorb incident coherent light if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are chosen such that @xmath40 ( pink arrow on the same figure ) .",
    "note that in this design algorithm , @xmath21 is fixed by what is required for electrical connection through the back reflector ( @xmath414@xmath0 m ) ; this can in principle be further reduced by employing a better connection topology .",
    "the fabricated cpa detectors have nominal parameters ; @xmath42 nm , @xmath43 , @xmath44 nm , @xmath45 , and @xmath46@xmath0 m .",
    "the electric field and power loss distributions are as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]c , for the structure excited with the mode of the strip waveguide at 1545 nm .",
    "the field is tightly localized by the cavity , and the absorption is concentrated over a micron - length portion of the nanowire . at resonance , the calculated absorption peaks at 98.4% , while reflection , transmission and radiated losses are 0.04% , 0.3% , and 1.1% respectively ( see simulated spectrum shown on fig .  [",
    "fig:2]d ) . analyzing the variation of peak absorption with different fabrication imperfections",
    "( see supplementary info ) shows the structure is quite robust .",
    "analysis of the radiation losses shows that 1% of the total 1.1% is lost to the substrate .",
    "@xmath22 could be further increased by undercutting the nanobeam , and the back - transmission could be further reduced by adding more holes . applying both strategies ,",
    "the losses would be reduced to @xmath30.2% and the absorption could peak close to @xmath399.8% . for comparison ,",
    "the simulated absorption of the same 8.5@xmath0 m long nanowire , but without the cavity , is 29% ; a 160@xmath0 m long nanowire would be needed to obtain 99.8% absorption in the absence of the cavity .",
    "the huge reduction of @xmath21 without compromising absorption efficiency ( @xmath47 ) promises a detector not only efficient in absorption , but also superior in the efficiency of converting absorbed photons to electric pulses ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "it also promises less dark counts , higher speed , and a more compact foot - print , as demonstrated and discussed below .      at the center of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] is a micrograph showing a portion of one of the fabricated chips .",
    "it consists of detectors with input waveguides ( wg ) connected to focusing grating couplers@xcite ( gc ) as well as gold electrical connections that are routed to large contact pads ( not shown ) .",
    "also included on the chip are devices with two gcs connected by a waveguide ; these were used for alignment and calibration purposes .",
    "the chip was installed on , and wire - bonded to , a custom - made printed circuit board that hosts electronic circuits to apply bias , preamplify the detection signal and impedance match the detector to a @xmath49 coaxial cable that runs to room - temperature amplifiers and then to a counter ( see schematics on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the board was installed in an optical cryostat ( svt-300 , janis inc . ) where it was submerged in superfluid helium ( t=2.05k ) .",
    "the whole sample holder is surrounded by a cylindrical brass shield with two holes ( s on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) of 6 mm diameter coaxial with the two 45 degree windows ( w on fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , one for the excitation laser light , and the other to image the chip for aligning and calibration . an attenuated and polarization - controlled continuous - wave ( cw ) tunable laser ( tlb-6600 , new focus inc . ) was coupled to waveguides by focusing it on the input grating couplers .",
    "the setup was calibrated to read the rate of photons incident through the input cryostat window ( @xmath50 on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) by a power meter ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "several measurements ( see methods ) were done to calibrate the coupling efficiency of the incident photons , @xmath50 , into the strip waveguides ( @xmath52 ) , as needed for on - chip efficiency measurements ( @xmath52 is shown by circles on fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a ) .      to measure the quantum efficiency and noise performance , three different count rates were determined ( see methods ) : photon count rate ( pcr ) measured when the input grating couplers were excited by the laser , background ( mostly black - body ) count rate ( bcr ) measured in the same conditions but with the laser off , and dark count rate ( dcr ) measured when a cylindrical brass shield ( 50@xmath0 m thick ) without any holes surrounded the sample holder .",
    "the bcr will exceed the dcr because the large cryostat windows - that were unshielded for pcr and bcr measurements - allow intense blackbody radiation to enter the cryostat . the quantum efficiency ( @xmath53 )",
    "was deduced from the measured rates as @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fig:3]a shows the system quantum efficiency , @xmath55 , for several snspds , all biased at a bias current equal to @xmath390% of the experimentally determined critical current ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "triangles are for two cpa - snspds , while squares are for a device with the same nanowire layout , but without any cavity holes , effectively a tw structure .",
    "the tw device exhibits a broad spectral response which is a down scaled version of @xmath52 ( expected because of the small @xmath47 for such short tw snspd ) .",
    "in contrast , the cpa devices show resonant - like spectra that almost ideally sample the @xmath52 .",
    "note that the off - resonant @xmath55 goes to negligibly small values compared to the peak ( only 0.3% of the peak @xmath55 ) confirming negligible contribution of non - guided photons to the peak pcr .",
    "although the efficiency numbers reported on fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a are small , a relevant number for integrated quantum optics applications is the efficiency of detecting photons that are already in the waveguide . with the same symbol conventions , fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b shows the on - chip qes at @xmath57 obtained by normalizing the above measured @xmath55 with @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath58 for devices without the cavity stays flat and small , as both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are broadband@xcite , and as @xmath47 is expected to be much less than unity .",
    "the qe for the cpa devices peak close to unity ( equal to unity within the uncertainty of the measurements ) signaling very efficient @xmath47 and appropriate functioning of the cpa design , as well as very high @xmath48 . shown on the same figure , with filled circles and a dashed line ( best lorentzian fit ) ,",
    "is the simulated @xmath59 ( assuming @xmath60 ) for the designed cpa detector .",
    "as can be seen the fabricated cpa devices perform close to the target qe . the small difference in the resonant wavelength is due to fabrication imperfections , and could be improved by using better fabrication tools .",
    "in addition to wavelength , the quantum efficiency of a cpa snspd is a function of bias current .",
    "figure  [ fig:3]c shows the qe versus bias current at a fixed wavelength for the same devices with the same symbols .",
    "the lines are best fits to experimental data using a double sigmoidal function .",
    "a typical bias current of @xmath30.9@xmath56 for each device is marked with a big square .",
    "the qe of the two cpa devices ( triangles ) measured at their resonant frequencies follow a single sigmoidal shape with saturation at 1.04 and 0.99 .",
    "these devices perform so well that the small difference between their measured saturated qe and unity stays less than our experimental uncertainties",
    ". however , their qes at @xmath30.9@xmath56 are @xmath32% smaller than the saturation level , showing a high @xmath48 of @xmath398% .",
    "this value together with the simulated value of @xmath6198.4% implies an upper bound for @xmath6296% at @xmath30.9@xmath56 .",
    "the qe for the non - cavity device ( squares ) measured at 1550 nm follows a more complex double sigmoidal curve , signaling the presence of a material or geometrical constriction in the nanowire ( in agreement with its smaller @xmath56 ) .",
    "but , the fitted sigmoid has a saturation at @xmath6327% ( @xmath641 at saturation ) , close to the simulated @xmath47 of 29% .    for comparison , a tw device with a simulated @xmath47 of 90%",
    "was also fabricated using a relatively long nanowire ( @xmath6535 nm ) length of 57.2@xmath0 m .",
    "the qe of this device ( diamonds on fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c ) changes considerably more gradually with the bias current than the cpa structures , most probably because of more non - uniformities along its long absorbing length . at @xmath30.9@xmath56",
    "the qe is only 89% of its saturated level at @xmath392% .",
    "this then clearly demonstrates the advantage of reducing @xmath21 in cpa detectors , which allows high @xmath48 and high @xmath47 , therefore a high qe .    quite apart from being efficient",
    ", a good detector must be low noise .",
    "figure  [ fig:3]d shows dcr and bcr measurements for devices of fig .  [ fig:3]c with the same symbols .",
    "the dcr starts from a plateau - like level at around 0.1hz followed by a fast exponential increase as expected for nanowire detectors .",
    "the plateau likely originates from black - body radiation that enters the cryostat from top or even through the thin brass foil ; it can be reduced by using better shields@xcite . at @xmath30.9@xmath56 the dcr for the non - cavity 57.2@xmath0 m long device is @xmath31.1hz , whereas the dcr for the cpa device is @xmath30.1hz .",
    "this confirms another advantage of the cpa design , in substantially reducing the dcr .",
    "note that a cpa - snspd at @xmath30.9@xmath56 ( see vertical dashed line connecting figures  [ fig:3]c and d ) maintains its high qe over a bias current range for which dcr stays negligibly small ( i.e. almost ideal detection performance ) .",
    "the bcr versus bias current curves show qe - like shapes which further suggests it originates from black - body or stray photons rather than being intrinsic to the detectors , like the dcr .",
    "this is in agreement with other studies that show how the bcr can be diminished by using well - shielded fiber coupled cryostats and utilizing inline cold filters@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:4]a shows a waveform histogram of amplified photon detection pulses from the detector when biased at 3@xmath0a and excited by a cw laser .",
    "an inductor , @xmath66100nh , was externally placed in series with the nanowire and the two were looking at an impedance of @xmath67 ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the measured pulse has a negative polarity making it compatible with the counter , and shows an under - damped shape because of the frequency cut - offs of the chain of amplifiers ( 10mhz to 1.2ghz ) .",
    "the counts are restored about 7ns after an initial detection event at the falling edge , approximately five @xmath68 time constants , as expected for an @xmath69 circuit .",
    "the external inductor was used in the measurement setup to ensure a smooth over - damped return of bias current to the nanowire , and therefore to avoid after pulses@xcite .",
    "however , this inductor can in principle be removed and replaced with a more careful read - out circuit to further reduce the reset time to its intrinsic limit , that is known to scale with nanowire length @xcite .        as for the timing jitter",
    ", the energy stored in a cpa cavity decays with a time constant @xmath70 .",
    "this gives @xmath710.23ps for the cpa - snspd designs reported here .",
    "provided @xmath72 is much smaller than the minimum reported timing jitter for nanowire detectors ( @xmath515ps ) , this cavity decay time constant should not have any adverse effect on the measured timing jitter . as an estimation of the timing jitter of this system , a single photon detection trace at 5@xmath0a is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b .",
    "the associated root - mean - square of the electrical noise is @xmath731.4mv , and the slope of falling edge is @xmath7462.7mv / ns . this yields an estimated timing jitter of @xmath7553ps full - width at half - maximum .",
    "this jitter is limited by the performance of the read - out circuits , and is consistent with reports on snspds with comparable bias currents@xcite .",
    "the demonstrated impact of coherent perfect absorption on the performance of a single photon detector paves the way for integrating hundreds of ultra - high performance detectors on a chip .",
    "the silicon host material facilitates high - performance cpa - snspds because of its high index contrast , while also offering the potential of integrating on - chip electronic circuits with the detectors to further boost the performance , and to handle the complexity of scaling up the read - out circuits .",
    "this latter point is especially interesting in light of studies that show the compatibility of cmos transistors with the cryogenic environment@xcite . the projected superior speed performance of cpa based detectors combined with their built - in filtered qe , and advanced fiber to waveguide coupling methods@xcite , will also make these detectors ideal for implementing fast quantum communication systems .",
    "frequency domain finite element solvers ( comsol , inc . ) are used for numerical simulations .",
