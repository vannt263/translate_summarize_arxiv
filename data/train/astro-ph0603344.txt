    "imaging polarimetry is one of the most useful methods for studying the structure and dust properties of such extended circumstellar disks ( e.g. , artymowicz 1997 ) .",
    "however , in spite of being the most studied vega - type stars , @xmath0 pic has rarely been the target of polarimetric observations .",

    "these optical polarization data have been modeled by voshchinnikov & krgel ( 1999 ) and krivova et al .",
    "the model results indicate that micron - size grains are the most important contributor to scattering and polarization of stellar radiation . to date , no near - infrared ( either aperture or imaging ) polarimetry studies have been reported , even though the properties of these optically dominant micron - size grains are best studied at near - infrared wavelengths .    in this paper , we present results on the ao coronagraphic imaging polarimetry of @xmath0 pic in the @xmath9 band ( 2.2 @xmath14 ) obtained with the 8.2 m subaru telescope and the infrared coronagraph imager with adaptive optics ( ciao ) .",
    "we discuss the properties of the dust in the disk on the basis of the polarization and intensity data by employing a light - scattering dust model .",
    "although the central @xmath11@xmath15 region is still unobservable ( due to the coronagraph mask ) , the present data provide the first imaging polarimetry of the @xmath0 pic disk at @xmath16120 au with a resolution of @xmath14 au , covering the possibly interesting transition zone around 100 au .",
    "the _ k _ band polarimetric imaging of @xmath0  pic was carried out on 2003 january 4 , using the ciao mounted on the subaru telescope ( tamura et al .",
    "the ao system was utilized under the natural seeing of @xmath17 at optical wavelengths , and the fwhm of about @xmath18 (= 3.7  au ) was achieved in the _ k _ band in spite of the large airmass ( 3.13.7 ) of @xmath0  pic .",
    "the pixel scale was @xmath19 mas pixel@xmath20 on the 1024@xmath211024 insb aladdin   array .",
    "we employed an occulting mask of @xmath22 diameter .",
    "the mask was not completely opaque and had a transmission of @xmath12% , which enabled us to measure the stellar position accurately .",
    "we used a circular lyot stop that blocked out the outer 20% of the pupil diameter .",
    "the polarimeter consisted of a warm halfwave plate and a cold wire grid analyzer ( tamura et al .",
    "the instrumental polarization was below 1% , as measured during the commissioning of the polarimeter .",
    "the exposures were performed at four position angles ( p.a.s ) of the halfwave plate , in the sequence of p.a .  =  0@xmath23 , 45@xmath23 , 22@xmath23.5 , and 67@xmath23.5 to measure the stokes @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 parameters .",
    "the integration time for each frame was 10  s ( 1  s @xmath21 10 coadds ) , and six frames were taken before rotation of the modulator .",
    "the integration time per modulator cycle was 240  s , and six cycles of data were collected . after the imaging of @xmath0  pic , hr 1998 ( a2 v ) was observed as a point - spread function ( psf ) reference star .",
    "the integration times for each frame and for each modulator cycle were the same as those for @xmath0  pic , and four cycles of data were collected .",
    "the obtained frames were calibrated in the standard manner using ` iraf ` ; dark subtraction , flat - fielding by dome flats , bad pixel substitution , and sky subtraction .",
    "the sky brightness was measured as the constant mode value in the region where no emission was found in the field of view .",
    "there was no significant change of the sky during obtaining images in each cycle .",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath27 , the degree of polarization @xmath28 , and the polarization angle @xmath29 were calculated as follows : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 the most dominant is the bright stellar halo , and the calculation of @xmath25 or @xmath26 values corresponds to the subtraction of the unpolarized stellar psf . because of a temporal variation in the psf , we rejected data that had a large intensity ratio between the central peak and the halo at @xmath35 compared with that of other data , and we checked the resultant @xmath25 and @xmath26 images .",
    "we performed frame registrations using the ` iraf / radprof ` tool by measuring the position of the star inside the mask .",
    "we then combined images for each modulator p.a . , and calculated the @xmath25 and @xmath26 images for each cycle .",
    "the resultant images were binned by 9 pixels ( @xmath36 ) with the ` iraf / blkavg ` tool .",
    "finally , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 images were averaged over all the cycles .",
    "the stokes @xmath24 parameter of the disk was estimated after the subtraction of the unpolarized halo of the central star .",
    "the reference psf was obtained from the @xmath24 image of hr  1998 .",
    "the images of hr  1998 were registered , rotated so as to adjust the p.a.s of the spider patterns with each other , and then combined .",
    "the psf was subtracted after the stellar position , spider pattern direction , and the halo flux at @xmath35 of the psf were matched to those of the @xmath24 of @xmath0  pic in each modulator cycle .",
    "we checked each psf - subtracted image and adjusted the scaling of the psf by eye so that the halo of @xmath0  pic was satisfactory subtracted .",
    "the psf - subtracted images of @xmath0  pic were binned by 9 pixels and the images of all modulator cycles were combined into one image .",
    "the total integration time was then 16.3 minutes for @xmath0 pic and 9.8 minutes for the psf reference star .",
    "the reference psf was elongated along a direction different from that of @xmath0  pic , possibly because these stars were observed at different elevations .",
    "in addition , the psf mismatch between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , or between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , caused residuals around the masked region .",
    "therefore , the inner region @xmath41 can not be discussed .",
    "a ghost image produced by the wire grid appears at @xmath11@xmath421 from the star , but does not affect our results as it is located at @xmath43 . considering the uncertainty caused by the psf - subtraction ( the registration , the scaling of the psf , and the mismatch of the psf shape ) , we estimated the uncertainty of @xmath44 as to be @xmath120% .",
    "the polarization degree @xmath28 was corrected with the efficiency of 97% in the _ k _ band , which was measured during the commissioning of the polarimeter .",
    "the interstellar polarization is negligible because of the proximity of @xmath0  pic , @xmath45% at optical wavelengths ( krivova et al .",
    "we calculated uncertainties in the degree of polarization by considering the standard deviations of the averages of @xmath25 and @xmath26 over six cycles , and the uncertainty caused by the psf subtraction for @xmath44 .",
    "although we can not estimate the consistency of each cycle because of its low signal - to - noise ratio , we confirmed the robustness of our results by calculating the polarization using only any of four cycles .",
    "we present the intensity image of the edge - on disk around @xmath0  pic in figure  1 .",
    "the scattered light arising from the dusty disk is detected from @xmath46 ( 50  au ) out to @xmath47 ( 121  au ) .",
    "the outer radius is determined on the basis of the observed sensitivity , as is clear from the previous optical observations showing the outer disk of @xmath48  au ( e.g. , smith & terrile 1984 ) .",
    "our adaptive optics observations detected the inner disk , @xmath49  au , with a resolution of @xmath50  au .",
    "three observations have been reported at optical and near - infrared wavelengths , which are comparable to our results in terms of the observed inner disk and the spatial resolution ( heap et al .",
    "2000 ; mouillet et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "our _ k _ band image of the inner disk is substantially consistent with the reported images .",
    "the `` warp structure '' seen in these images is also confirmed in the _ k _ band .",
    "we estimated the p.a .",
    "of the disk midplane by a least squares fitting under the assumption that the disk has its maximum intensity along the midplane ( e.g. , kalas & jewitt 1995 ) .",
    "the fitting was performed on the unbinned @xmath24 image , and on the northeastern and southwestern wings at the same time .",
    "first , we assumed the p.a .",
    "of the midplane roughly , and we detected the pixel position on the detector if the pixel showed a maximum value in each radial step of @xmath51 over the disk vertical range of 1@xmath52 .",
    "the linear fitting to the spatial distribution of such pixels gave the more precise pa of @xmath53 through the central star , measured for @xmath54 .",
    "this value is consistent with the previous optical and near - infrared estimates for the inner disk .",
    "we adopted @xmath55 as the p.a .",
    "of the disk midplane for a comparison with a theoretical model , as described later .",
    "figure  2 shows the surface brightness profile measured along the disk midplane .",
    "the slope of the profile is measured by a least squares fitting in the radial range of @xmath56 , as @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the northeastern and southwestern wings , respectively .",
    "these slope values are in good agreement with those at optical wavelengths ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the northeastern and southwestern wings , respectively , at @xmath56 ) .",
    "k_@xmath7 band slopes reported by mouillet et al .",
    "( 1997a ) are fitted in different radial ranges , and , thus , can not be directly compared with ours .",
    "note that the profile reveals a clear difference from that seen in the younger disks around pre - main - sequence stars ( e.g. , augereau et al .",
    "2001 ) ; the profile appears to have ripples rather than a smooth decline .",
    "we discuss the origin of the ripples in  4 .",
    "the intensity levels in the northeastern and southwestern wings are similar at equal radii for @xmath54 .",
    "this is substantially consistent with the @xmath12 result .",
    "we could not confirm the large ( @xmath10.5 mag ) intensity asymmetry seen in the _",
    "k_@xmath7 band intensity profile reported by mouillet et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the vertical thickness ( fwhm ) of the edge - on disk was measured by fitting a gaussian function .",
    "the fitting was applied to each radial bin of 9 pixels within a radius 80  au where the signal - to - noise ratios are sufficiently high .",
    "since we could not find any dependence of the fwhm on the radius , the obtained fwhms were averaged , resulting in 18 and 19  au in the northeastern and the southwestern disks , respectively .",
    "these fwhm values are consistent with the previous optical ( 1518 au ) and near - infrared ( 20 au ) data .",
    "the _ k _ band polarization map of @xmath0  pic is presented in figure  3 .",
    "the observed emission is polarized nearly perpendicular to the radial direction , indicating that grains in the disk scatter the light from the central star . although there are some regions where vectors deviate from the centro - symmetric pattern , they are confined to regions where the signal - to - noise ratios are relatively poor .",
    "thus , the @xmath0  pic disk is seen as an infrared reflection nebula as in the case at optical wavelengths ( gledhill et al .",
    "1991 ; wolstencroft et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we show the _ k _ band degree of polarization along the disk midplane in figure  4 .",
    "we detected about 10% polarization in @xmath61  au .",
    "the degrees of polarization are roughly the same for the northeastern and southwestern wings , as for the radial surface brightness levels .",
    "in contrast , the optical polarization data show a substantially higher level of polarization ( @xmath115% at @xmath62  au ) and a higher polarization with an asymmetrical distribution in the southwestern wing . since the uncertainty is large in the outer southwestern wing ( @xmath63  au )",
    ", we can not claim that the polarization increases with radius .",
    "note that there is a dip in the polarization levels around @xmath2 100 au in both wings .",
    "in this section , we compare the results of our polarization measurements with detailed model calculations to gain an insight into the properties of dust grains in the debris disk around @xmath0 pic .",
    "we code for model polarized intensities by incorporating mie theory into the algorithm that is described in artymowicz et al .",
    "numerical calculations require reasonable assumptions concerning the spatial and size distribution of dust grains ( artymowicz et al .",
    "1989 ; artymowicz 1997 ) .",
    "krivova et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have successfully reproduced the dependences of linear polarization on wavelength and radial distance by assuming the presence of homogeneous spherical silicate grains throughout the disk .",
    "we calculated the stokes parameters @xmath64 using mie theory and subsequently the degree of linear polarization @xmath65 by employing their model parameters : the disk is inclined by @xmath66 with respect to the line of sight and truncated at @xmath67  au in cylindrical coordinates @xmath68 , the radius of dust grains ranges from @xmath69  nm to @xmath70 m , and the spatial and size distribution @xmath71 in the range of dust radius from @xmath72 to @xmath73 is described as @xmath74^{1.1}}\\right\\ }   \\left[\\left(\\frac{r}{{r}_{0}}\\right)^{-1}+\\left(\\frac{r}{{r}_{0}}\\right)^{2.7}\\right]^{-1 } { a}^{-3.5 } ,   \\label{n } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75  au ( i.e. , 6 ) and @xmath76 , as used for the outer disk model of krivova et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in the inner disk at distances of @xmath77 , however , we set @xmath78 , as inferred from our near - infrared measurements of the inner disk .",
    "stellar radiation pressure reduces the number density of grains with @xmath79 by blowing them out of the system .",
    "here @xmath80 is the dust radius at which the ratio of radiation pressure to stellar gravity reaches 0.5 ( see , e.g. , zook & berg 1975 ) . note that once the composition of grains is assumed , the `` blown - out '' radius @xmath80 and the amount of the reduction in the number density are no longer free parameters .",
    "we take the refractive indices of `` astronomical silicate '' from laor & draine ( 1993 ) , for which @xmath81 m ( see kimura & mann 1999 ) .",
    "an estimate of the reduction factor for the density @xmath82 is not trivial , because a nonlinear equation along with assumptions for unknown sources of dust has to be solved ( krivov et al .",
    "2000 ) . here",
    "we simply reduce the number density for dust grains having radius @xmath83 by a factor of 10 in the northeastern wing of the disk and by 15 in the southwestern wing .",
    "we note that our observed @xmath9 band polarization turned out to be inconsistent with the reduction factors of approximately 15 ( northeastern ) and 20 ( southwestern ) adopted by krivova et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "figure  5 shows the model polarization in the midplane ( @xmath84 ) plotted together with our near - infrared data ( @xmath85 ) as well as currently available optical data from gledhill et al .",
    "( 1991 ; @xmath86 ) and wolstencroft et al .",
    "( 1995 , open circles with error bars ) .",
    "prior to calculations of the polarization , the derived stokes parameters were integrated over @xmath87 both optical and infrared data in a direction perpendicular to the midplane .",
    "note that the model properly reproduces the absolute values and spectral variation of the linear polarization , as well as its northeast - southwest asymmetry at optical wavelengths and northeast - southwest symmetry at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we also found that the radial profile of the observed _ k _ band intensity agrees with our numerical results for the stokes @xmath24 parameter ( figure  6 ) .",
    "our numerical simulations in the optical wavelength range provide a neutral color in the outer disk , consistent with the multiple - wavelength data from paresce & burrows ( 1987 ) and lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "the color becomes slightly redder in the inner part of the disk , but we can not reconcile the strong decrease in the _ b _ band brightness that was observed by lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "the observed _ k _ band polarization is characterized by its low value and northeast - southwest symmetry , in contrast to the high value and asymmetrical distribution of the optical polarization . to better understand this wavelength dependence , we consider the blown - out radius in comparison with the radius of dust particles that mainly determines the degree of linear polarization at each wavelength of the observations .",
    "it is worth noting that dust grains in the rayleigh scattering regime ( @xmath88 ) as well as in the geometrical optics regime ( @xmath89 ) produce a polarization much higher than that observed , while grains in the mie scattering regime ( @xmath90 ) lower the polarization ( voshchinnikov & krgel 1999 ) . at optical wavelengths , mie scattering particles",
    "are smaller than the blown - out radius ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) and therefore their abundances are lowered . as a result ,",
    "the optical polarization is kept high , in particular , in the southwestern wing , where the number of mie scattering particles is greatly reduced .",
    "provided that the radius of mie scattering particles is comparable to or larger than the blown - out radius ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) , the polarization becomes low and symmetrically distributed .",
    "the low and northeast - southwest symmetrically distributed polarization observed in the _ k _ band implies that the blown - out radius @xmath80 lies in the range of microns , consistent with @xmath93 m in our model .",
    "the model uses compact , spherical , optically bright silicate grains whose properties are in accord with the high albedo estimated by backman et al .",
    ". optically bright compact grains are consistent with the blown - out radius of a few microns necessary for explaining the observed low _",
    "k _ band polarization .",
    "regardless of our successful results , however , spherical silicate grains are not necessarily representative of real dust particles in the @xmath0 pic debris disk .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopic observations have revealed a similarity between dust in the @xmath0 pic debris disk and cometary dust in the solar system ( knacke et al .",
    "cometary dust is likely an optically dark fluffy aggregate consisting of submicron - sized grains ( greenberg & gustafson 1981 ; kimura et al .",
    "2003 ) . in a model with dust aggregates for the @xmath0 pic system ,",
    "a problem is encountered in that the blown - out radius of fluffy aggregates is much larger than a few microns ( cf .",
    "kimura & mann 1999 ) . to resolve this apparent discrepancy",
    ", we here consider icy parent bodies `` planetesimals '' that consist of ice and dust , analogous to cometary nuclei in the solar system ( see yamamoto 1985 ) .",
    "after ejection from their parent bodies , dust particles are still encased in ice at the distances of our observations , although we have to keep in mind the possibility that the intense ultraviolet radiation from @xmath0 pic erodes icy grains by photo - sputtering ( see artymowicz 1994 ) . if ice fills the pores of optically dark dust aggregates , then the dust may resemble optically bright compact particles .",
    "the refractive indices of ice with optically dark inclusions are close to those of silicates , depending on the volume fraction of the inclusions ( see mukai et al .",
    "1986 ) . as a result , the blown - out radius of ice - filled",
    ", optically dark aggregates would lie in the range of microns , as expected for dirty water - ice spheres ( cf .",
    "artymowicz 1988 ) .",
    "our results may indicate that compact spherical silicate grains are simply a good approximation for ice - filled fluffy aggregates of optically dark submicron grains existing in the @xmath0 pic system .",
    "although the smooth model curves fit the intensity and linear polarization profiles in the _ k _ band well , a noticeable dip appears in both the intensity and polarization profiles at @xmath94@xmath95 ( i.e. , 102104  au ) along both directions ( figs . 2 and 4 ) , except for in the sw intensity profile .",
    "the dip is also seen in the pi profile , indicating that it is not caused by an artifact due to the psf subtraction for @xmath44 .",
    "we here interpret the dip in terms of a gap in the radial density distribution of dust grains around 100 au from the central star .",
    "keeping in mind that the observed radiation is an integrated quantity over a line of sight , the effect of a gap on the integrated quantity depends on its integrand . by analogy to interplanetary dust or cometary dust , we expect the integrand of intensity to show a strong forward scattering enhancement and the integrand of polarization to peak around a scattering angle of @xmath96 ( artymowicz 1997 ) .",
    "although a deficit of dust grains reduces the intensity , forward scatterers residing far from the gap region tend to obscure the reduction .",
    "this may explain why the dip in the intensity profile is seen only on the northeast side of the disk where the signal - to - noise ratio is higher than the southwest side .",
    "when the line of sight is tangent to a gap in the radial dust density , a low degree of polarization results from a lack of dust grains having scattering angles around @xmath96 .",
    "on the other hand , an erroneous hump in the intensity profile would decrease the polarization , but simultaneous decreases in both the intensity and the polarization do not seem to be coincidental .",
    "mouillet et al . ( 1997a ) measured the _",
    "k _ band surface brightness of the @xmath0 pic disk , in which we confirm the presence of a similar dip around @xmath94 .",
    "it is highly unlikely that both we and mouillet et al .",
    "( 1997a ) erroneously obtained a dip at the same distance from the star on the basis of independent data and analyses .",
    "therefore , this dip is not an artifact arising from our data analysis , but is a real signature corresponding to the depletion of dust grains around 100  au .",
    "we expect that dust grains are located near their parent - body planetesimals , because grains are destroyed by mutual collisions before being transported inward by the poynting - robertson effect in the @xmath0 pic system ( artymowicz 1997 ; krivov et al .",
    "consequently , the dip in the intensity and polarization profiles around 100  au is evidence for a paucity of planetesimals in this region .",
    "our _ k _ band intensity data reveal not only the dip around 100  au but also ripple structures over the entire observed disk region between 50 and 121  au ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . comparing our intensity data with the results of mouillet et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , we realize that there is a great similarity between the ripple structures obtained in the two independent observations .",
    "if all the humps in the ripple structures are in fact planetesimal belts , then our data indicate that the @xmath0 pic disk consists of multiple planetesimal belts .",
    "several planetesimal belts ( rings ) have already been identified from mid - infrared observations of the @xmath0 pic disk in the inner region ( @xmath97  au ) ( wahhaj et al .",
    "2003 ; okamoto et al .",
    "2004 ; telesco et al .",
    "recent observations have revealed that the @xmath0 pic debris disk resembles the circumstellar disk around au microscopii , including spatially localized enhancements and deficits ( liu 2004 ; metchev et al . 2005 ) .",
