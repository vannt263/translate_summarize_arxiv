    "primordial density fluctuations grow during cosmological times and lead to the observed structures in the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , via gas collapse and condensation in the evolving dark - matter haloes .",
    "the statistical distribution of the primordial fluctuations is still debated , though .",
    "in fact , despite the common assumption of gaussianity , recent analyses show evidences for positively skewed distributions ",
    "see the summary table  2 in @xcite . + high redshift represents an interesting regime to potentially investigate these non - gaussian effects , since very early structures and primordial mini - haloes ( hosting the first bursts of star formation , spreading the first heavy elements in the universe , seeding the first black holes , being responsible for primordial cosmic re - ionization and hydrogen 21-cm emission ) are expected to be somehow affected by the underlying matter distribution @xcite .",
    "+ in this respect @xcite , a key tool for studies of high - redshift environments might be represented by @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) , powerful explosions emitting @xmath0 rays .",
    "these bursts have ( comprehensive reviews are given in @xcite ) : isotropic equivalent peak luminosities as high as @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ; an isotropic angular distribution ; and a bimodal duration distribution , made mostly of long grbs ( with a period longer than 2  seconds ) , and in minor part of short grbs ( detected at low redshift with a period shorter than 2  seconds ) . in the next",
    ", we will only consider long grbs ( lgrbs ) , because they are linked to the death of massive stars and hence are indicators of the local star formation episodes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "+ here , we will show that grbs can be used as cosmological probe of the amount of non - gaussianity present in the primordial density field , because they are sensitive to the underlying cosmological model through the cosmic star formation history ",
    "further datails on this subject can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ we will reach this conclusion by performing a detailed analysis of the grb rate in different gaussian and non - gaussian scenarios , based on n - body , hydrodynamic , chemistry simulations of early structure formation @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the adopted initial mass function ( imf ) for the stellar populations tracked during the runs are used to determine the expected grb formation rate density in the various cases , and hence the integrated grb rate ( @xmath3 ) , for both metal - poor population  iii ( hereafter , popiii ) regime and metal - enriched population  ii - i ( hereafter , popii - i ) regime .",
    "given the cosmic sfr , @xmath4 , tracked by the different runs as a function of @xmath5 in different cosmological models @xcite , the expected redshift distribution of observed grbs can be computed once the grb luminosity function ( lf ) and the grb formation history have been specified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from these",
    ", we then compute the evolution of the grb formation rate density , @xmath6 , and the corresponding integrated grb rate , @xmath3 .",
    "+ the ( comoving ) sfr densities are obtained by a set of numerical n - body , hydrodynamical , chemistry simulations with two different box sizes ( 0.5 and 100  mpc/_h _ , with @xmath7 ) starting from initial conditions with a different level of primordial non - gaussianity , parameterized in terms of the non - linear parameter @xmath8 . + the observed peak photon flux , @xmath9 , emitted by an isotropically radiating source at redshift @xmath5 and corresponding luminosity distance @xmath10 , as detected in the energy band @xmath11 , is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the differential rest - frame photon luminosity of the source . to describe the typical burst spectrum we adopt a `` band '' function with low- and high - energy spectral indices equal to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , and normalization : @xmath16 with @xmath17 isotropic - equivalent peak luminosity .",
    "+ given a normalized grb lf , @xmath18 , the observed number rate of bursts ( in @xmath19 ) at redshift @xmath5 , with peak photon flux , @xmath9 , between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is @xmath22 where the factor @xmath23 accounts for cosmological time dilation , @xmath24 is the comoving volume at redshift @xmath25 , and @xmath6 is the actual comoving grb formation rate density . + by assuming that grbs are good tracers of star formation , we can write that the grb formation rate density is proportional to the sfr density : @xmath26 where the normalization constant , @xmath27 ( whose dimensions are the inverse of a mass ) , incorporates further not - well - known effects , like grb beaming , efficiencies , and black - hole production probability ( depending on the adopted imf ) . +",
    "as for the lf , we will adopt a normalized grb lf described by a single power - law with slope @xmath28 and decreasing exponentially below a characteristic luminosity , @xmath29 , @xmath30 additionally , we take into account possible rdshift evolution of the grb lf by setting @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the characteristic luminosity at @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the evolution parameter . + for simplicity , the normalization of @xmath18 is included in @xmath27 , and it is fixed when the grb number rate in equation  ( [ eq : ndot ] ) is normalized to the rate observed at @xmath33 . + from the previous relations we can finally compute the grb rate ( in units of yr@xmath2  sr@xmath2 ) , @xmath3 , as the derivative with respect to the solid angle , @xmath35 , of the grb number rate , @xmath36 : @xmath37 we determine the parameters of the model by fitting the recent _ swift _ redshift - complete sample by @xcite .",
    "+ we apply our calculations to the different non - gaussian cosmologies previously mentioned to derive count predictions as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "we underline that the following results are valid for an ideal instrument , that is able to detect all the grbs at any redshift .",
    "the main effects of primordial non - gaussianities on grbs are due to the differences in the redshift evolution of the sfrs in the various scenarios ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , hence , in the consequently different grb rates .         in fig .",
    "[ fig : rall ] ( see also @xcite ) , we plot the grb rate , @xmath3 , for the small 0.5  -size boxes ( left panels ) and the large 100  -size boxes ( right panels ) . in the top panels ,",
    "we show the redshift evolution for all the values considered , while in the bottom panels we focus on the relative contribution of the popiii grb rate ( @xmath38 ) to the total rate , that is widely dominated by popii - i stellar generations , at redshift lower than @xmath39 .",
    "+ in both small and large volumes the effects due to the presence of primordial non - gaussianities are visible at @xmath40 .",
    "the rates eventually converge at later times , when feedback processes start dominating the gas behaviour and the resulting star formation .",
    "+ these trends are valid for both popii - i and popiii regimes , even though the latter is usually negligible , predicting popiii grb rates , @xmath38 , that , following the behaviour of the popiii sfrs , drop by two orders of magnitude ( bottom - left panel ) .",
    "further discussions can be found in @xcite .",
    "assuming that long @xmath0-ray bursts are fair tracers of star formation @xcite , we propose to use them as probes of the underlying matter distribution at high redshift , when the possible presence of non - gaussianity would have visible effects on the baryon evolution ( we refer the interested reader to @xcite for further details and discussions ) .",
    "+ we find that already at @xmath41 cosmologies with large values have distinctive characteristics compared to those of the gaussian case . at very early times ( @xmath42 )",
    "the boost in the rate due to non - gaussianities is @xmath43 orders of magnitudes for = 1000 , and up to a factor of @xmath44 for = 100 , while milder differences of a factor of @xmath45 are still visible for values of @xmath46 50 .",
    "these effects are particularly evident on the total grb rate , that is largely dominated by popii - i stars , while the result for the popiii grb rate is noisier , mostly for @xmath47 , as a consequence of the corresponding , short - lived , popiii star forming regime @xcite .",
    "we highlight that differences in the grb rate induced by non - gaussianities are expected to be important mostly at very high redshift , while additional hydrodynamic processes and feedback mechanisms would wash out any memory of primordial non - gaussianities at lower @xmath5 .",
    "+ the existence of grbs at such high redshift is not unlikely , as a small population of extremely dark grbs , i.e. bursts for which the afterglow remains undetected in spite of early and deep k  band observations , has been recently identified @xcite . while the nature of these grbs is still matter of debate , it is possible that some of them are at @xmath48 .",
    "if confirmed , this could provide evidence for mildly positive non - gaussian parameter . to draw more definitive conclusions and give more stringent constraints much larger high-@xmath5 grb complete samples , currently not available in the literature ,",
