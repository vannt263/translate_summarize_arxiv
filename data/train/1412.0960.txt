    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are transient lmxbs .",
    "they spend most of the time in the quiescent state at low luminosity , and occasionally turn into outbursts during which their luminosity increases by several orders of magnitude . during outbursts ,",
    "sxts show distinctive states with coupled spectral and timing properties : in the low - hard state ( lhs ) the soft x - ray ( e.g. , 0.310 kev ) energy spectrum is dominated by a power - law spectral component and the fourier power spectrum at low frequency is dominated by broad band noise component and quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , and the variability amplitude is quite large at a few tens percent level , while in the high - soft state ( hss ) the soft x - ray energy spectrum is dominated by a thermal disk component and the fourier power spectrum is dominated by a power - law noise component with little variability ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "systematic studies of the state transitions in sxts during the rising phase of transient outbursts suggest that the accretion process is non - stationary : the luminosity of the hard - to - soft state transitions can occur at quite different luminosity , spanning two orders of magnitude which correlates with the rate - of - increase of the luminosity as well as the peak luminosity of the corresponding outbursts @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the mass accretion rate can not be the only parameter that determines the transition between the accretion states and the rate - of - change of the mass accretion rate is one important parameter which determines the regimes of the accretion states in sxt outbursts .",
    "the most popular picture for the x - ray energy spectra in the distinct states of black hole and neutron star sxts is the truncated disk picture , such as the model proposed in @xcite . in this picture",
    "the change of the energy spectrum is associated with the change of the accretion geometry .",
    "a geometrically - thin but optically - thick disk is truncated at the truncation radius .",
    "the region within the radius is filled with a hot flow such as the radiatively - inefficient accretion flow . in the quiescent and the hard state ,",
    "the truncation radius is quite large . during the rising phase of transient outbursts the truncation radius moves inward with increasing mass accretion rate , and reaches the innermost stable orbit during the soft state . the detailed process that truncates the disk is not clear , and proposals for the physical mechanism include magnetosphere - disk interaction ( * ?",

    "the x - ray spectral model we used consisted of four components , namely a power - law component representing the emission from the hot accretion flow , a blackbody component for the emission from the neutron star surface , a gaussian line component with its central energy fixed at 6.5 kev representing a broad iron emission line , and the absorption by galactic neutral hydrogen .",

    "it is also worth noting that the 2001 outburst was peculiar since it was not a fast rise with exponential decay ( fred ) outburst as others .",
    "in addition , the hard - to - soft state transition in the 2001 outburst was also peculiar since it occurred when the luminosity declined @xcite .",
    "for the 2009 outburst , we identified the time corresponding to the hard - to - soft state transition based on source timing properties .",
    "this is based on the fact that for other atoll sources , such as 4u 1608@xmath052 , the state transition is accompanied by the transition of properties of the power spectra ( see for example , figure 7 of @xcite ) . in aql",

    "some examples of our model fits can be seen in figure  [ fig : pdsfit1 ] , in which we show the power spectra with the best - fit models corresponding to three observations performed during the 1999 outburst .",

    "first we examined the maximum lfqpo frequency the source can reach in the hard states ; this frequency may correspond to a certain radius or timescale in the accretion flow when the state transition occurs .",
    "as seen from figures  [ fig : qpoevo ] , the maximum lfqpo frequency varies among outbursts , from @xmath15 in the 2000 outburst to @xmath16 in the 2001 outburst , although the uncertainty of the latter is quite large . in the 2009 outburst ,",
    "the maximum frequency was @xmath17 .",
    "we took the weighted average of the maximum lfqpo frequency of the 1999 and the 2001 outburst , i.e. , @xmath18 , as the estimate of the maximum lfqpo frequency seen in aql x@xmath01 in the following discussion .",
    "the evolution pattern of @xmath3 was quite similar among the outbursts . in the following analysis , for the 2004 outburst , we concentrated on the last four observations in the hard state before the hard - to - soft transition , since earlier observations corresponded to a special flare in the light curve , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : lchr ] . for the peculiar 2001 outburst ,",
    "the frequency was around 10 hz at the beginning , then increased rapidly to around 30 hz at about 6 days before the state transition , and then decreased to around 24 hz at about just one day before the transition , and finally turned to around 40 hz at the time of the state transition .",
    "for all the other outbursts , the frequency of the lfqpo increased with time consistently during the rising phase of the outbursts .    in our model - independent approach",
    ", we estimated the rate - of - change of the lfqpo frequency , following @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the lfqpo frequency , @xmath21 is the time , and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote two consecutive observations",
    ". then we calculated the fractional rate - of - change of the frequency @xmath22 , corresponding to the time at @xmath23 .",

    "the fractional rate - of - change increased from 10% day@xmath24 at the beginning of the outburst , to @xmath1100% day@xmath24 just before the state transition .",
    "the pattern of the increase of the lfqpo frequency deviates from a single exponential pattern , which would follow a straight line if plotted in logarithmic scales , and the fractional rate - of - change would be constant with time .",
    "we tried two phenomenological models to fit the pattern .",
    "the first one is an exponential quadratic polynomial , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "this function is continuous and the fractional rate - of - change increases with time when the parameter _ a _ is positive ; the second one is of a broken exponential function , i.e. , the frequency first increases with a constant e - folding timescale @xmath26 , then afterwards the frequency increases with another constant e - folding timescale @xmath27 .",
    "we fit the models to the data of the 1999 outburst and the 2009 outburst which have the most number of data points available ( which is also more than the number of model parameters ) .",
    "the dashed and the dotted lines show the best - fit broken exponential and exponential quadratic polynomial models , respectively . notice that the time at zero corresponds to the time when the last observation of the source in the hard state was taken .    for the 2009 outburst ,",
    "the @xmath6 were 8.76 with 6 degrees of freedom ( dof ) and 34.25 with 7 dof for the broken exponential function and exponential quadratic polynomial function , respectively , indicating that the former model describes the pattern of the frequency evolution better .",
    "the result from the best - fit broken exponential model showed that the frequency increased with an e - fold timescale of @xmath28 and @xmath29 days before and after the moment at @xmath30 days before the state transition , respectively . for the 1999 outburst , the model fit with an exponential quadratic polynomial gave a good fit with @xmath31 with 2 dof , while the fit with the broken exponential model yielded a @xmath32 with 1 dof , indicating we were lacking statistics to constrain the later model .",
    "the trend in both the 2009 outbursts suggests that the frequency increased with time at different speed in the early and in the late stage of the hard state during the rising phase of an outburst , further supporting the idea that the transition is associated with non - stationary accretion during these outbursts .      in figure",
    "[ fig : frevsflux ] we show how the lfqpo frequency evolved with the 220 kev flux . during the rising phase of an outburst ,",
    "the frequency in general increased with the x - ray flux , except for the peculiar 2001 outburst .",
    "the frequency - flux relation for each outburst deviates from a straight line on a log - log plot , showing that it does not follow a simple power - law relation .",
    "the power - law model was only acceptable for the 2000 outburst , with @xmath33 and 1 dof , while for other outbursts the model was rejected .",
    "the model parameters in the fits with the power - law model are tabulated in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "we fit the data with a broken power - law model instead .",
    "such a model consists of four free parameters : the normalization , the break frequency , and the power - law indices before and after the break .",

    "the power spectra show that the source can reach significantly different characteristic qpo frequencies at similar x - ray fluxes .",
    "for instance , as shown in figure  [ fig : frevsflux ] , at a source flux of @xmath56 , the frequency of the lfqpo was at around 2 hz for the 1999 and the 2011 outburst , but at around 30 hz for the 2001 outburst .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for a certain characteristic frequency , the x - ray flux is usually higher in the outbursts in the years of 1999 , 2000 and 2011 , which were associated with higher state transition fluxes , while the x - ray flux corresponding to the same qpo frequency was lower in the outbursts in the years of 2001 , 2004 , 2009 and 2010 , which were associated with lower state transition fluxes .",
    "there is another anti - correlation between the maximum lfqpo frequency and the state transition flux ( or the outburst peak x - ray luminosity ) , with the spearman correlation coefficient of -0.96 at a significance level of @xmath57 .",

    "[ fig : frevsflux ] .",
    "actually the maximum frequency of the lfqpo was reached during the 2001 and the 2009 outburst , which was associated with the lowest state transition fluxes .",
    "we have analyzed the observations obtained during the rising phase of seven outbursts of the neutron star soft x - ray transient aql x@xmath01 with the _ rxte_/pca when the source was in the hard state .",
    "as expected , in the power spectra , the characteristic break frequencies of the band - limited noise component and the frequency of the lfqpos were correlated , consistent with the overall correlation established in a large sample of black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries previously found .",
    "the frequency evolution of lfqpos is shown in figure  [ fig : pdsevo ] .",
    "both the characteristic frequency of the band - limited noise and the frequency of the lfqpos increased with the pca/220 kev count rate before the hard - to - soft state transitions , except for the peculiar 2001 outburst .",

    "[ fig : corr ] we also show that the frequency correlation between band - limited noise and the lfqpos holds down to the timescale of one to two days , since the _ rxte _ observations were taken roughly every other day",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the correlation on shorter time scales with future x - ray missions to test if such a correlation holds on shorter time scales .",
    "in addition , we found that the characteristic frequency vs. flux relation is significantly different among the seven outbursts .",

    "the relationship between the frequency and the source flux deviated from a simple power - law form .",

    "for the 2009 outburst , if we model it with a broken power - law function , we found that the power - law indices were @xmath54 and @xmath55 before and after the break , respectively .",

    "the magnetospheric model therefore predicts that the truncation radius @xmath71 .    in the disk evaporation model , the heat generated in the corona formed above the disk is conducted down to the lower layer of the corona and radiated away .",
    "if the density of the lower layer is too low to efficiently radiate away the heat , the thin disk would be heated and then evaporated , leading to a steady mass flow from the disk to the corona .",
    "in a stationary state , the outer disk would be truncated at a radius @xmath72 where the evaporation is balanced by the mass inflow from the outer disk .",
    "this truncation radius lies at @xmath73 .",
    "further development of the model included the effect of the viscosity and the accretion disk magnetic field @xcite , which gives the truncation radius @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the viscous parameter and @xmath76 is the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure .",
    "the truncation radius depends only weakly on the viscosity .",
    "it is worth noting that the parallel - track phenomenon of the lfqpo shown in fig .",
    "8 , which is similar to that seen for the khz qpos , actually suggests that mass accretion rate is not the only parameter that determines the qpo frequency . however , let s consider the simplest case where mass accretion rate is the only parameter in the accretion system .",
    "as we know , both disk truncation models predict that the truncation radius is a function of the mass accretion rate , i.e. , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the normalization coefficient .",
    "then we get the relation between the lfqpo frequency and the mass accretion rate as @xmath79 if taking the lower khz qpo as the orbital frequency at the inner disk edge and as @xmath80 if taking the upper khz qpo frequency as the keplerian frequency at the inner disk edge . for the former case ,",
    "the index @xmath81 is @xmath82 in the evaporation model and @xmath83 in the magnetospheric model ; while in the later case which corresponds to the upper khz qpo assumption , the index @xmath81 is @xmath84 in the evaporation model and @xmath85 in the magnetospheric model . in the above estimates we have assumed that the bolometric correction factor was a constant during those observations and that the bolometric luminosity was proportional to the mass accretion rate ( i.e. , the radiation efficiency did not change a lot ) .    in section  [ sec : frevsflux ]",
    "we showed that for the well - sampled 2009 outburst , the frequency vs. the x - ray flux relation was best - fit by a broken power - law model with indices of @xmath54 and @xmath55 before and after the trend break .",
    "both of the values are larger than that predicted by the magnetospheric model . as for the disk evaporation model",
    ", we found that for the case corresponding to the lower khz qpo assumption , during the early rising phase of the outburst , the observed index before the trend break is consistent with the model , while after the break the observed index is much larger than that predicted by the disk evaporation model .",
    "this might indicate that the disk evaporation model is consistent with the observed evolution of the inner disk edge at the early rising phase of those outbursts but not later on .",
    "for the case corresponding to the upper khz qpo assumption , the disk evaporation model overestimates the index in the early stage of the outburst but underestimates the index in the later stage .",
    "this suggests that at least additional physics should be considered in the current disk evaporation model .",
    "we also realised that additional constraints can be put on the evaporation model as well from the so - called ` parallel - track ' phenomenon of the lfqpo . in the improved evaporation model investigated in @xcite ,",
    "the truncation radius , @xmath72 , depends on the magnetic field in the accretion disk as @xmath86 . in order to explain the observations showing that lower characteristic frequency can be observed under similar mass accretion rates in the outbursts with a higher state transition luminosity",
    ", the disk evaporation theory with the consideration of the magnetic field has to be consistent with the fact the brighter an outburst is , the lower the magnetic pressure in the accretion disk should be , due to the fact that there is empirical correlation between the luminosity of the hard - to - soft transition and the peak luminosity of the outburst or the following soft state @xcite .",

    "<S> we have studied the evolution of the low frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( lfqpos ) during the rising phase of seven outbursts of the neutron star soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) aql x@xmath01 observed with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte)_. the frequency correlation between the low frequency break and the lfqpo sampled on the time scale of @xmath12 days was seen . except for the peculiar 2001 outburst , </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the lfqpos increased with time before the hard - to - soft state transition up to a maximum @xmath2 at @xmath131 hz , a factor of @xmath15 higher than those seen in black hole transients such as gx 339@xmath04 , making the maximum qpo frequency a likely indicator of the mass of the central compact object . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic frequencies increased by around ten percent per day in the early rising phase and accelerated to nearly one hundred percent per day since @xmath12 days before the hard - to - soft state transition . </S>",
    "<S> we examined the dependence of the frequency @xmath3 on the source flux @xmath4 and found an anti - correlation between the maximum frequency of the lfqpos and the corresponding x - ray luminosity of the hard - to - soft transition ( or outburst peak luminosity ) among the outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that x - ray evaporation process can not be the only mechanism that drives the variation of the inner disk radius if either of the twin khz qpo corresponds to the keplerian frequency at the truncation radius . </S>"
