    "topological phases of matter are of strong interest to physicists@xcite .",
    "exciting recent developments in this area are the discoveries of topological insulators , which can be viewed as time - reversal invariant analogs of integer quantum hall ( iqh ) states@xcite .",
    "a natural question is if the nature supports time - reversal invariant analogs of _ fractional _ quantum hall ( fqh ) states , namely fractional topological insulators ( ftis ) . just like fqh states",
    ", ftis are expected to be stabilized by strong interaction .",
    "perhaps the simplest fti state@xcite is two ( decoupled ) copies of laughlin states for up- and down - spin electrons , with _",
    "opposite _ chirality .",
    "such states are the exact ground states of model hamiltonians@xcite with special short - range repulsions between electrons with the same spin , but no interaction between electrons with opposite spins .",
    "more recently lattice models that support ftis have been constructed in both two dimension ( 2d)@xcite and three dimension ( 3d)@xcite . since ftis are stabilized by specific forms of interactions , it is important to understand the stability of ftis when interactions are varied , and in particular , what kind of competing phases ftis yield to when quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) are triggered by varying interactions",
    ". also of strong interest is the nature of such qpts , and the critical properties of the qpt when it is continuous .    motivated by the above we consider the stability of the simplest fti state@xcite in the presence of more general electron - electron interaction , in particular inter - spin interactions .",
    "we show that sufficiently strong inter - spin repulsion leads to phase separation , while inter - spin attraction drives the system into a superfluid ( sf ) phase .",
    "the fti - sf transition is 2nd order , and in the 3d xy universality class .",
    "we also show that the fti and sf phases have natural analogs in bilayer quantum hall systems at total filling factor 1 with layer imbalance@xcite ; our results are thus relevant to that system which is of strong interest in its own right .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the simplified model and discuss the related symmetry . in sec .",
    "[ phase ] we focus on the numerical result on various properties of different phases , including energy spectrum , pair correlation function , and global phase diagram .",
    "the corresponding effective field theory is constructed in sec .  [",
    "effective ] .",
    "finally we discuss the essential relation between sf phase and bilayer layer quantum hall systems at total filling factor 1 in sec .",
    "[ bilayer ] .",
    "in this work we use a simple model to study ftis , in which landau levels are created by the spin - orbit coupling in the presence of a strain@xcite .",
    "unlike external magnetic field , strain does _ not _ break time reversal symmetry . as a result electrons with opposite spins experience opposite",
    "_ effective _ orbital magnetic fields , and landau levels with opposite chirality appear for opposite spin orientations . the single - particle hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 with spin dependent vector potential @xmath1 , with @xmath2 for up- and down - spin electrons .",
    "ref . discussed how to realize such a situation in specific semiconductor materials ; here we use this as an idealized model to study the stability of ftis .    just like in fqh states electrons",
    "are confined to the lowest landau level , and electron - electron interaction dominates . in this work",
    ", we consider _ hard - core _ interaction @xmath3 between same spin fermions , and @xmath4 between opposite spin fermions ; @xmath5 is magnetic length .",
    "the intraspin interaction @xmath6 is the energy of a pair of electrons with relative angular momentum @xmath7 which is first introduced by haldane@xcite .",
    "it captures the essence of the topological phases and gives rise to the exact model ground state , laughlin state .",
    "the interacting hamiltonian @xmath8 is defined by setting @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where the parameter @xmath11 tunes the relative strength between the @xmath6 and @xmath12 terms . throughout the paper we set the overall energy scale @xmath13 as energy unit and magnetic length @xmath14 as length unit .",
    "we also use torus geometry by imposing ( magnetic ) periodic boundary conditions . in second quantization",
    "the interacting hamiltonian reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the creation operator for an electron with spin index @xmath17 and landau orbital index @xmath18 .",
    "the full symmetry analysis of fqh systems at _ rational _ filling factors was provided by haldane  @xcite . here",
    "we generalize his analysis , and show eigen states of our system can be characterized by a 2d wave vector @xmath19 for _ arbitrary _ filling factor . to prove this we introduce magnetic translation operator for particle @xmath18 with spin @xmath17 : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 commutes with @xmath23 , but @xmath24 and thus do _ not _ commute with each other in general , due to the berry phase induced by magnetic field .",
    "we now introduce the center - of - mass translation operator : @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be center of mass translations by some arbitrary amounts along @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions .",
    "both @xmath26 and @xmath27 commute with the many body hamiltonian @xmath30 which can be separated into a center of mass term and relative motion terms . since _",

    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : overpd ] , from which it is clear that phase separation ( ps ) is a first - order instability of the fti phase , while the fti - sf transition appears to be continuous .",
    "in this section we develop an effective field theory that describes the fti and sf phases on equal footing , and in particular , the phase transition between them .",
    "our starting point is the chern - simons - landau - ginzburg ( cslg ) theory  @xcite for fqh states , in which the laughlin state is viewed as a superfluid state of composite bosons made of electrons bound to appropriate amount of flux . since the fti can be viewed as two copies of the laughlin state with",
    "_ opposite _",
    "chirality , it is thus natural to attach _ opposite _ flux to electrons with opposite spins",

    "notice the minus sign between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; this indicates the flux is in _ opposite directions _ for up- and down - spin composite bosons .",
    "the presence of pairing ( or attractive ) interaction between up- and down - spin electrons is encoded by introducing a pair field @xmath77 , with lagrangian density @xmath78 . it represents bound state of up- and down - spin composite bosons , and sees _ no _ external gauge field @xmath79 , due to the cancelation between @xmath80 and @xmath81 . on the other hand",
    "it couples equally to the cs gauge fields @xmath82 and @xmath83 . using terminology familiar in cold atom contexts",
    ", we call the parameter @xmath84 detuning ; positive @xmath84 favors unbound electrons while negative @xmath84 favors pair formation . thus decreasing @xmath84 corresponds to increasing pairing strength . the @xmath85 term in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) describes pair formation and decay processes .",
    "generic density - density interactions among the particles are kept implicit and represented by @xmath86 . due to the relation between particle and cs flux density enforced by the cs terms ,",
    "such density - density interactions can also be written in terms of cs flux density @xmath87 .",
    "the distinction between the fti and sf phases is the following . in the fti phase , which is topologically equivalent to two independent fqh states , composite bosons with up- and down - spins",
    "both condense , namely @xmath88@xcite ; this gives rise to anderson - higgs masses to the cs gauge fields , and the corresponding meisnner effect is equivalent to incompressibility responsible for fqhe .",
    "due to the @xmath85 term in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , this implies @xmath89 . in the sf phase",
    "however , there is only a pairing gap that penalizes _ imbalance _ between up- and down - spin electron numbers , but _ no _ overall charge incompressibility .",
    "this suggests in the sf phase @xmath90 while we _ still _",
    "have @xmath89 , as @xmath77 couples _ only _ to the combination @xmath91 whose flux is the _ difference _ between up- and down - spin electron density .",
    "thus the fti and sf phases differ by one u(1 ) condensate , and the transition is driven by the appearance / disappearance of this condensate .",
    "the situation is somewhat similar to a transition between integer and fractional quantum hall states driven by pairing interaction studied in ref . .",
    "in particular , if we completely suppress the fluctuations of cs gauge fields , the critical theory will reduce to that of the ( 2 + 1)d xy model just as in ref .",
    ", with the critical u(1 ) field being @xmath92 .    also like in ref . , fluctuations of cs gauge fields changes the physics , but in a very different manner here . to proceed",
    ", we introduce new combinations of cs gauge fields : @xmath93 , in terms of which eqs .",
    "( [ la],[lm],[lcs ] ) take the form @xmath94 notice in particular the cs term is a bilinear coupling between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , of the bf form@xcite . noting that since @xmath89 , and thus @xmath95 acquires an anderson - higgs mass of the form @xmath97 _ throughout the phase diagram _ , we can safely integrate @xmath98 out ; due to their coupling to @xmath99 through @xmath100 , this will generate maxwell terms of the form @xmath101 .",
    "integrating over @xmath102 enforces the proportionality constraint between @xmath103 and total density ; this allows us to write some of the density - density interactions in  @xmath86 \" in the form of the remaining maxwell terms @xmath104 .",
    "thus the effective action of @xmath96 after integrating out @xmath95 is that of maxwell theory @xmath105 , with space - time re - scaled according to the _ non - universal _ photon velocity , which is the goldstone mode ( or sound ) velocity in the superfluid phase .    as a result",
    "the final critical theory for the fti - sf transition is that of ginzburg - landau - maxwell theory in ( 2 + 1)d , with euclidean lagrangian density ( after proper re - scaling of the critical field @xmath106 ) , which is _ dual _ to the ( 2 + 1)d xy model@xcite : @xmath107&=&|(\\partial_\\mu - ia_\\mu^-)\\psi_-|^2 -\\lambda|\\psi_-|^2+u|\\psi_-|^4\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\alpha f^{-\\mu\\nu}f^-_{\\mu\\nu}+\\cdots.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here  @xmath86 \" represent irrelevant terms involving higher order of derivatives or powers of fields ( either in the original lagrangian or generated by integrating out @xmath95 ) . in the sf phase , @xmath108 , the @xmath96 gauge field is in the coulomb phase which supports a _ single _ branch gapless photon mode with linear dispersion ; this corresponds to the goldstone mode of the sf phase . in the fti phase @xmath109 ( as a result we have two condensates , including @xmath110 ) , and the @xmath96 gauge field is in the higgs phase where there is _ no _ gapless excitation .",
    "the transition is in the ( 2 + 1)d xy universality class due to the duality .",
    "our model has close relation with bilayer quantum hall system at total filling factor @xmath112 ( where @xmath113 and @xmath114 correspond to filling factors of top and bottom layers respectively ) , especially in the presence of layer imbalance .",
    "this relation is revealed by making a particle - hole transformation@xcite for the lower layer and describe it in terms of _ holes _ , which results in hole filling factor @xmath115 .",
    "since the holes carry opposite charge as the electrons , the chirality due to external magnetic field is _ opposite _ for them as well .",
    "the ground state in the strong particle - hole pairing limit is nothing but the halperin 111 state  @xcite written in terms of electron coordinates , which is the ideal model state for the pseudospin ferromagnet@xcite or interlayer exciton condensate state@xcite .",
    "the corresponding wave function written in terms of electrons in top layer and holes in bottom layer is presented in ref . .",
    "the specific case of @xmath32 correspond to @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and the fti and sf states discussed here correspond to decoupled single layer fqh and interlayer exciton condensate states .",
    "a transition between them has been observed experimentally@xcite , and the theory developed here for the fti - sf transition applies to that case as well .",
    "we note while bilayer quantum hall liquid is a fascinating system in its own right , it may now also be used as testing ground for some of the theoretical predictions@xcite and proposed techniques@xcite to probe ftis due to their close relation , given the fact that there is no candidate system for fti at this point .",
