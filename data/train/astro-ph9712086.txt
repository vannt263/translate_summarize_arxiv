    "ngc  3079 is a nearly edge - on ( @xmath5 ) sbc galaxy at a distance of @xmath6  mpc ( @xmath7  mpc@xmath8 ; 1  mas corresponds to 0.08  pc ) .",
    "kiloparsec - scale radio lobes ( @xcite ) and loops of h@xmath9 emission ( @xcite ) extend along the minor axis of the galactic disk .",
    "ionized material in these lobes shows evidence for a @xmath10  outflow ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . heckman ( 1980 ) classified the optical emission spectrum of ngc  3079 as that of a liner , which could indicate shock - induced ionization in the galaxy ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "irwin & seaquist ( 1991 ) fit three - dimensional galactic disk models to h  i line emission , and determined a systemic velocity of @xmath11  with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , for the radio astronomical definition of velocity , @xmath12 ( at , @xmath13  ) .",
    "observations of co emission revealed a dense , rotating molecular ring extending @xmath14 to 750  pc from the nucleus along a position angle of @xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the disk rotates as a solid body out to a radius of 400  pc , where the velocity is 330  . within a 400  pc radius ,",
    "the disk has a mean molecular density of 530  @xmath16 and a total molecular mass @xmath17 , or about 50% of the dynamical mass in this inner region of the galaxy .",
    "irwin & sofue ( 1992 ) inferred a systemic velocity for the rotating co disk of @xmath18  , nearly 40  greater than the systemic velocity inferred for the galactic disk from h  i emission ( @xcite ) ; the origin of this discrepancy is unclear .",
    "large - scale outflows of the type observed in ngc  3079 have been observed in a number of galaxies that exhibit high far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities and evidence for starburst activity ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "however , hawarden _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) present a number of arguments against the starburst hypothesis in ngc  3079 :    * despite an unusually large concentration of molecular gas in the inner kiloparsec , the low ratio of fir luminosity to molecular mass ( @xcite ) indicates that the star formation efficiency is not very high ; * the 10  @xmath19 m emission does not appear to be centrally concentrated ( @xcite ) , as would be expected if there were starburst activity in the nucleus ; * the mid - ir spectral energy distribution is relatively flat , which is atypical of starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) ; * the inferred extinction towards the nucleus , @xmath20  mag , is lower than expected for a dusty starburst region .",
    "an alternative model for the origin of the outflow in ngc  3079 was proposed by duric & seaquist ( 1988 ) , who suggested that a jet from a compact central engine could be directed along the minor axis of the galactic disk by interaction with dense gas in the nuclear environment .",
    "this interaction should result in strong shocks in the molecular gas in the nucleus .",
    "the observed strength of emission in the lower vibrational transitions of h@xmath21 is consistent with collisional excitation in strong ( @xmath22  ) shocks ( @xcite ) .",
    "blue - shifted oh maser emission to the south of the nucleus ( @xcite ) may mark the boundary between a dense nuclear disk and a nuclear cavity swept clear by outflowing material .",
    "a 5  ghz vlbi observation of the nucleus of ngc  3079 , made in 1986 by irwin & seaquist ( 1988 ) , hereafter is , revealed two compact continuum components , each @xmath23  mjy and with a projected separation of 1.5  pc along an axis with a position angle @xmath24 e of n. following the convention of is , we will refer to the southeastern compact feature as component , and the other as component .",
    "an extended feature ( component ) lying between  and  was tentatively identified , but its characteristics were not well - constrained by the observation .",
    "the quoted 5  ghz flux density of the entire nucleus ( at sub - arcsecond resolution ) ranges between 60 and 100  mjy ( see @xcite ) , which implies that components  and  contribute at most 40% of the total nuclear continuum emission at this frequency .",
    "is argued that if the compact vlbi sources are features in a jet confined by the ambient nuclear medium , then the momentum flux in the inner parsec of ngc  3079 is sufficient to power the kiloparsec - scale outflow ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "irwin & sofue ( 1992 ) find evidence in co emission of a component of molecular gas with high velocity dispersion , flowing away from the nucleus along the  axis .",
    "they suggest that `` spurs '' in the co images along a position angle of @xmath25 may indicate a second outflow perpendicular to the one along the  axis .",
    "pedlar ( 1996 ) observed that the nuclear h  i absorption profile is comprised of a deep feature at 1140  flanked by red- and blue - shifted features offset at @xmath26  .",
    "baan & irwin ( 1995 ) observed a similar profile in h  i and oh absorption , although they found that the red - shifted absorption peaks @xmath27  pc to the south of the other components .",
    "vlbi images at 21  cm ( @xcite ) showed an hi absorption feature at continuum component  that is red - shifted by @xmath14  with respect to a similar feature at component ; absorption at velocities intermediate to these two features is seen at some level against both components .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  3079 is a site of intense h@xmath21o maser emission , the majority of which is distributed over a velocity range of @xmath28  , centered on @xmath29  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the flux density of the brightest feature , at 957  , has varied between 1 and 8  jy over a 10-year monitoring period ( @xcite ) , with @xmath30  jy variations occurring on timescales of months .",
    "the average line width is @xmath31  . with the exceptions of a 140  mjy feature at @xmath32  ( @xcite ) and a faint feature at 1123  ( this paper ) ,",
    "all of the known h@xmath21o maser emission is blue - shifted relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "it has been suggested ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; @xcite ) that the extreme brightness of the h@xmath21o maser in ngc  3079 could result from highly beamed , unsaturated amplification of 22  ghz emission from compact sources by foreground molecular gas .",
    "a vlbi observation made in 1988 ( @xcite ) revealed that the majority of the maser emission is confined to a region @xmath33  pc in diameter , distributed among several compact clumps 0.0020.02  pc in extent .",
    "two clumps with a projected separation of 0.08  pc lie 0.5  pc to the north of this region .",
    "several of the unresolved maser clumps exhibit emission over an unusually broad doppler velocity range , up to 25  .",

    " 6 summarizes our results .",
    "we observed the @xmath35 transition of h@xmath21o ( rest frequency @xmath36  ghz ) toward ngc  3079 for 8 hours on 1995 january 9 , using the nrao vlba and the vla , which operated as a phased array of 27 antennas .",
    "the data were recorded in left circular polarization in four 8  mhz passbands of 512 spectral channels each ( 0.21  channel spacing ) .",
    "the band - center lsr velocities were 1150 , 1020 , 934 and 800  , with the fourth bandpass tuned to lie outside of the known velocity range of maser emission .",
    "the data were processed on the vlba correlator , and post - correlation processing was performed with aips . amplitude calibration included estimated corrections for atmospheric opacity and elevation - dependent variations in antenna gain .",
    "we calibrated residual delays and fringe rates , and complex bandpass response with observations of 3c273 , nrao150 and 4c39.25 .",
    "we referenced the phases of all spectral channels to a single strong channel ( at 954.5  ) on the edge of the brightest maser feature . to image the maser emission , we coherently averaged the visibility data in sets of four spectral channels . to image the continuum",
    ", we averaged over all the channels in the bandpass tuned to lie outside the known range of maser emission .    the 5 and 8  ghz continuum observations were made on 1992 september 15 and 29 .",
    "the 5  ghz observations used an array consisting of the vlba stations at hancock , kitt peak , and los alamos , the nrao 140  ft antenna at green bank , and the vla phased - array .",
    "the 8  ghz observations were made with a vlbi array consisting of the vlba stations at hancock , fort davis , and kitt peak , the nrao 140  ft antenna , the 100  m antenna of the mpifr at effelsberg , and the vla phased - array .",
    "the fringe calibrator sources for the continuum observations were oj287 and 0917 + 624 .",
    "ngc  3079 was observed with a bandwidth of 28  mhz for a total of 2  hr at each frequency .",
    "the data were correlated with the mkiii correlator at haystack observatory .",
    "post - processing and synthesis imaging were performed in aips .",
    "table  [ tb - stat ] lists the naturally weighted restoring beam and @xmath37 image noise for our observations .",
    "figure  [ fg - bigmap ] shows the angular and velocity distribution of water maser emission in the nucleus of ngc  3079 .",
    "figure  [ fg - spec ] is a spectrum generated from the total imaged flux density in each 0.8  spectral channel .",
    "the emission arises in compact ( @xmath38  pc ) `` clumps '' , most of which lie in a 0.2  pc - diameter cluster with a velocity range @xmath39  ; this cluster includes the maser peak ( 3.6  jy at @xmath40  ) , at the origin of the map in figure  [ fg - bigmap ] . two additional clumps , 0.5  pc ( 7  mas ) to the north , overlap the main cluster in doppler velocity , emitting over a range @xmath41  .",
    "the overall distribution of the h@xmath21o maser features we observed in 1995 january is similar to that seen in 1988 february ( greenhill 1990 ) , although certain clumps have faded while new ones have appeared .",
    "clumps that appear to be common to both epochs coincide to @xmath42  mas , although proper motions between two epochs , for spectrally blended features , can not be estimated reliably .",
    "the normalized fringe visibility amplitude of the maser peak is @xmath43 on our longest baseline ( 6500  km ) .",
    "we therefore place an upper limit of 20  @xmath19as on the angular size of the maser peak ( linear size @xmath44  cm ) , and a lower limit on the peak brightness temperature , @xmath45  k. haschick _",
    "( 1990 ) obtained a similar lower limit on the peak brightness temperature with a four - station intercontinental vlbi observation in 1986 october .",
    "some of the clumps are extended , and exhibit apparent gradients in radial velocity .",
    "for example , the maser peak , at 957  , lies in a @xmath46  pc elongated clump ( figure  [ fg - bigmap ] , _ inset _ ) oriented roughly nw - se , that exhibits a projected doppler velocity gradient of nearly 4000  pc@xmath8 .",
    "gradients of similar magnitude are present in other clumps , though their position angles do not appear to be correlated with each other or with any larger - scale nuclear structure .",
    "if the masers do in fact lie in a nearly edge - on disk , extended clumps are likely to be foreshortened , and so the apparent velocity gradients should be regarded as upper limits .",
    "note that the blending of two or more features that are poorly resolved in angle and velocity can mimic a velocity gradient in an extended structure .",
    "thus , the gradients we observe do not necessarily imply the presence of coherent , rotating structures in the molecular gas .",
    "however , in the case of the extended clump containing the maser peak , `` kinks '' in the structure belie the presence of more than two unresolved sub - features , and these kinks at least display a true dependence of doppler velocity on position within the clump , which can not be attributed to spectral blending alone .",
    "we detected two red - shifted maser features .",
    "the first is a single 140  mjy feature , 1.2  pc sse of the maser peak , at a @xmath47 of 1190  .",
    "this feature was first identified in a single - antenna spectrum of 1995 april ( @xcite ) . including this red - shifted feature with the blue - shifted clumps to the north",
    ", we find that the maser emission in the nucleus of ngc  3079 extends a projected distance of 1.7  pc along an axis with a position angle of about @xmath48 ( figure  [ fg - bigmap ] ) . this axis is approximately aligned with the major axis of the kpc - scale galactic disk ( position angle = @xmath15 ) as seen in optical ( nilson 1973 ) , h  i ( @xcite ) and co ( @xcite ; @xcite ) images .",
    "the second red - shifted feature lies off of this north - south axis , 1.2  pc se of the 22  ghz continuum peak (  [ contin ] ) , at a @xmath47 of 1123  .",
    "this feature is angularly coincident with a faint , extended 22  ghz continuum source .",
    "we note that a second maser feature , at 1040  , also lies off the north - south axis , 0.2  pc nw of the 22  ghz continuum peak .",
    "these off - axis features define a second axis , with a position angle of @xmath49 , that is shared by the nuclear continuum components .",
    "this suggests that there is a second population of water masers in ngc  3079 that may be interacting with or amplifying the jet .",
    "figures  [ fg - cmap ] , [ fg - xmap ] and [ fg - kmap ] show naturally - weighted 5 , 8 and 22  ghz images of the parsec - scale continuum emission in the nucleus of ngc  3079 .",
    "table  [ tb - contin ] lists the fitted parameters of the compact continuum sources identified at each of these frequencies .",
    "figure  [ fg - sed ] compares the flux densities of the two brightest continuum components ,  and .      at 5  ghz",
    "we detected both continuum components  and  of is .",
    "the angular separation of the peaks of these two components is within 1.4  mas of that measured in 1986 february , from which we place an upper limit on the relative proper motion of the two continuum features of @xmath50as  yr@xmath8 ( @xmath51 ) . due to the limited @xmath52 coverage of the 5  ghz vlbi observation ,",
    "no substructure was resolved in either component .",
    "note that while the flux density of  in 1992 is approximately the same as that measured by is in 1986 , component  appears to have faded somewhat ( table  [ tb - contin ] ) .",
    "however , given the quoted uncertainties in the flux density measurements of is , it is not possible to determine with this observation whether either component is in fact variable at 5  ghz .",
    "we did not detect the extended continuum component  reported by is .",
    "however , component  exhibits an extension to the w at the @xmath53 level ( figure  [ fg - cmap ] ) , and there is some indication of emission that is undersampled by our shortest baselines .",
    "we report the detection of a third continuum component ( labelled  in figure  [ fg - cmap ] and table  [ tb - contin ] ) , located @xmath30  pc se of  along the  axis .",
    "component  is not visible at the 0.5 and 0.7  mjy / beam ( @xmath54 ) level at 8 and 22  ghz , respectively . given the deconvolved size of this source at 5  ghz , @xmath55  mas , it would be significantly resolved at 8 and 22  ghz ( see table  [ tb - stat ] ) .",
    "experimentation with various subsets of the visibility data indicates that component  could have a flat spectrum and still be undetectable in our higher - frequency images . however , we can rule out a rising spectrum above 5  ghz .",
    "this differs from  and , both of which clearly peak between 5 and 22  ghz ( table  [ tb - contin ] ) .      at 8  ghz",
    "we also detected both continuum components  and .",
    "component  is comparatively strong , and extends @xmath56  pc along a position angle of @xmath57 .",
    "component  is clearly composed of multiple features , clustered within @xmath33  pc of each other .",
    "the measured flux densities of these subcomponents range from 2 to 7  mjy , and their angular sizes are typically @xmath58  mas ( 0.15  pc ) .",
    "relative to the centroid position of component is @xmath1  mas to the se ( along a position angle of @xmath59 ) of that observed at 5  ghz .",
    "this difference is likely due to differences in the brightness distribution within  at the two frequencies ; the 8  ghz substructure appears to trace the limb - brightened se edge of an extended source that is centered near the 5  ghz position .",
    "the integrated flux densities of both  and  are greater at 8  ghz than at 5  ghz .",
    "assuming they did not vary significantly in flux over the 12 days separating the observations , we find both sources have inverted spectra between 5 and 8  ghz : @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "we imaged both continuum components  and  at 22  ghz ( figure  [ fg - kmap ] ) by phase - referencing the spectral visibilities to the maser peak and averaging over an apparently line - free velocity range of @xmath62  .",
    "the maser peak lies @xmath63  mas to the ene of component , at a position angle of @xmath64 .",
    "we detect no 22  ghz continuum emission to a @xmath54 limit of 0.75  mjy / beam at the position of any of the maser features in the north - south distribution described in  [ maser ] .",
    "the 22  ghz emission is dominated by component with an integrated flux density of @xmath65  mjy .",
    "figure  [ fg - kmap]b was produced with a 100  m@xmath66 gaussian taper applied to the visibility weights in the @xmath52 plane , in order to lower the angular resolution and thus reveal more extended emission .",
    "inspection of the images reveals that  consists of a @xmath67  mjy unresolved core , plus a @xmath68  mjy halo extending @xmath56  pc to the sse .",
    "fainter halo emission is visible in the untapered image at the @xmath69 ( @xmath58  mjy / beam ) level , extending @xmath33  pc to the se along the jet axis .",
    "( figure  [ fg - kmap]a )",
    ". the integrated flux density of at 22  ghz in 1995 january is clearly less than it was at 8  ghz in 1992 september ( figure  [ fg - sed ] ) ; if the component is not intrinsically variable , we find a spectral index @xmath70 between these two frequencies .",
    "however , the fitted size of this component at both frequencies is @xmath71  pc , so flux variations on timescales of years would not violate light travel - time constraints .    in the high - resolution 22  ghz image",
    "( figure  [ fg - kmap]a ) , continuum component  has a poorly defined morphology ; it peaks at approximately the same position relative to component  as the easternmost compact subcomponent observed at 8  ghz ( figure  [ fg - xmap ] ) .",

    "it is clearly elongated east - west over @xmath73  mas ( 0.5  pc ) . in the higher - resolution 22  ghz continuum image ( figure  [ fg - kmap]b ) , this source appears mottled at the @xmath54 level .",
    "images of intermediate angular resolution suggest that it consists of several compact components distributed along an east - west axis .",
    "we did not detect any emission between  and  in our 5 or 8  ghz images .",
    "if  consists of multiple compact continuum sources , they must have inverted spectra between 8 and 22  ghz .",
    "alternatively , it may be comprised of multiple , faint maser features distributed between 750 and 800  .",
    "note that the maser feature at @xmath74  is coincident with the centroid of component  ( figure  [ fg - bigmap ] ) .",
    "the detection at 5  ghz of three compact continuum features , separated from each other by at least several parsecs and lying along a common axis , strongly suggests that these sample a jet , rather than physically unconnected regions of starburst activity .",
    "the question then arises as to which component ( if any ) represents the central engine .",
    "baan & irwin ( 1995 ) suggest that component  is the core and   is part of the jet , based on the presence of h  i and oh absorption features at two distinct velocities in the nucleus .",
    "( the angular separation of  and  is unresolved in their images . )",
    "if the absorption is due to material in a disk that rotates in the same sense as the galaxy , the more blue - shifted absorption component should be associated with continuum component , and that near the systemic velocity with component , which they identify as the core .",
    "however , recent high - resolution vlbi observations of h  i absorption ( s. satoh 1997 , private communication ) indicate that the absorption profile towards continuum component  is red - shifted with respect to that towards component .",
    "it is not clear whether the absorption profile reflects rotation , outflow or more complicated motion in the absorbing gas , or whether it is intrinsic to the compact sources .    typically , the core component of a vlbi core - jet structure in a radio galaxy is compact and has a flat spectrum . in ngc  3079 ,",
    "continuum sources  and  both exhibit extended or multi - component structure .",
    "this is most apparent in the 8  ghz image ( figure  [ fg - xmap ] ) , where the morphology of  suggests a jet lobe limb - brightened on its leading edge , while  exhibits an extension perpendicular to the jet axis . also , at 22  ghz ( figure  [ fg - kmap ] ) ,  appears to consist of an unresolved core containing 75% of the total flux , plus a halo that extends to the south and east .",
    "furthermore , neither component has a flat spectrum ( figure  [ fg - sed ] ) , but rather exhibit a turnover between 5 and 22  ghz suggestive of free - free or synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the spectra of both sources are quite similar , except that the flux density of  is consistently lower than that of .",
    "if one were a jet component and the other a compact core , we might expect less similarity in their spectra .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  3079 may be a low - luminosity , nearby example of the class of compact symmetric objects ( cso s ) that exhibit gigahertz - peaked spectra ( gps ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these sources have been attributed to bipolar jets from agn that are impeded by unusually high - density nuclear gas . in the context of this model ,",
    "the compact continuum components mark the ram pressure  confined leading edges of a jet that is burrowing out through the dense medium ( @xcite )",
    ". the peaked continuum spectrum may be due either to synchrotron self - absorption , or to free - free absorption in ambient ionized nuclear gas .",
    "it is likely that neither component  nor marks the central engine of ngc  3079 .",
    "if the maser features trace an edge - on disk that feeds the jet (  [ discusmas ] ) , the core should lie near the intersection of the axes of the maser and continuum distributions .",
    "note also that  and  are roughly equidistant from this point , as would be expected for oppositely directed lobes of a non - relativistic jet .",
    "we therefore suggest that the central engine lies near the midpoint between continuum components  and .",
    "component was detected only at 5  ghz .",
    "non - detection at 8  ghz may be due in part to resolution effects .",
    "however , an inverted spectrum like that of  and  can be ruled out . since it is nearly twice as far from the assumed position of the central engine , component  may have significantly different physical characteristics than the other two .",
    "for example , synchrotron losses may have altered the relativistic electron energy distribution , or the source could have expanded as it travelled further along the jet .",
    "if these three sources are synchrotron self - absorbed emission , the spectrum of  may turn over at a lower frequency than that of  or .",
    "if extrinsic ( _ e.g. _ free - free ) absorption is also occuring , the different spectral characteristics may be a function of different lines - of - sight through foreground material .",
    "component , observed in the low - resolution 22  ghz image ( figure  [ fg - kmap]b ) , is close to , but not coincident with , the assumed position of the central engine .",
    "its position also agrees within the measurement errors with the position of continuum component c of is ; however , that source was observed at 5  ghz , and was considerably larger ( table  [ tb - contin ] ) , so it is not clear that they are the same .",
    "component  is unusual in that it was only detected at 22  ghz , which suggests an inverted spectrum extending to high frequencies .",
    "it is possible that  is spectral in nature .",
    "a cluster of faint , blue - shifted maser features distributed over @xmath28  in doppler velocity would appear as a continuum source in the 22  ghz images , which were produced by averaging in frequency over an apparently line - free region of the spectrum (  [ obs ] ) .",
    "this hypothetical maser could amplify an undetected background continuum source in the vicinity of the central engine .",
    "the sense of rotation of the galactic disk of ngc  3079 is such that the northern side is approaching and the southern side is receding .",
    "( the galaxy s inclination of @xmath75 causes the near side of the disk to be projected to the west of the major axis . )",
    "the overall distribution of maser doppler velocities is roughly consistent with their arising in the inner parsec of an edge - on molecular disk that is rotating in the same sense as the kpc - scale molecular disk observed in co emission ( figure  [ fg - model ] ) .",
    "the center of rotation would be approximately midway between the main blue - shifted maser cluster and the 1190  feature to its south .",
    "note , however , that the velocity dispersion of the clumps in the northern ( blue - shifted ) half of this maser structure is comparable to the apparent rotation velocity , @xmath76  . given that the masers do not trace a clear rotation curve , it is difficult to estimate the mass distribution of the inner parsec of ngc  3079 .",
    "however , the overall velocity distribution is consistent with the presence of a binding mass of @xmath2 within 0.5  pc of the center of the putative disk .",
    "this system is significantly less well - defined than that in the center of ngc  4258 , where water masers trace a thin , moderately warped , keplerian disk of inner radius 0.13  pc , outer radius 0.26  pc , and a central mass of @xmath3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    if the masers in ngc  3079 emit isotropically , the total luminosity in the 22  ghz transition is @xmath77 , in a volume @xmath78  pc@xmath79 .",
    "( for comparison , the brightest galactic water maser source , w49n , has an isotropic luminosity of only @xmath80 in a comparable volume . )",
    "it is difficult to account for such a high luminosity with standard maser pumping models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the true luminosity is probably less than the isotropic luminosity by a factor @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is solid angle into which the maser emission is beamed .",
    "maser amplification of radiation from a compact background source naturally results in small @xmath82 .",
    "earlier vlbi and vla observations established that the centroid of the masing region in ngc  3079 was within 5  mas of the centroid of the nuclear radio continuum source ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was predicted that at higher resolution , individual bright water maser features would be seen projected against one or both of the compact continuum components identified in the 5  ghz vlbi image of is .",
    "we have found , however , that no bright maser emission in this galaxy is angularly coincident with any detectable compact continuum emission .",
    "the main cluster of maser features is offset by @xmath83  mas ( 0.4  pc ) from the 22  ghz compact continuum peak ( source ) .",
    "highly beamed emission is probably still occurring in ngc  3079 .",
    "first , the maser features may amplify compact continuum sources that are below our detection threshold , although the observed distribution of maser features would require a complex continuum morphology .",
    "second , superposition of two or more maser features with similar radial velocities along the line - of - sight can result in highly beamed emission ( @xcite ) , although this model may have difficulty reproducing the observed velocity range of bright maser features , and the extended structures with velocity gradients .",
    "third , beaming may result from exceptionally high aspect ratios in the molecular gas .",
    "for a saturated , velocity - coherent cylinder with a ( length / diameter ) aspect ratio @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    one model for the pumping of water masers in agn relies on irradiation of molecular gas by x - rays from the central engine ( @xcite ) .",
    "a dense cloud that is illuminated by an external x - ray source will develop a warm layer in which the water abundance is enhanced , and in which collisional pumping maintains a population inversion .",
    "the presence of dust can greatly increase the depth of this layer by absorbing the infrared photons produced in the pumping process that would otherwise thermalize the molecular energy levels and quench the maser ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however ,",
    "the luminosity of the nucleus of ngc  3079 in soft ( 0.53  kev ) x - rays is @xmath86  erg  s  ( @xcite ) , and there is no convincing evidence of a nuclear hard x - ray source , obscured or otherwise , from asca observations ( k. weaver 1997 , private communication ) . hence",
    ", x - ray heating is probably not a significant source of pumping for the water maser in this galaxy .",
    "an alternative pumping model invokes molecular shocks .",
    "a fast ( @xmath28  ) , dissociative shock propagating through a medium with a preshock density of @xmath87  @xmath16 will leave a large column of warm ( @xmath88  k ) molecular gas in its wake , in which the h@xmath21o abundance is enhanced and collisional excitation maintains the maser population inversion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting sheet - like masing region , when viewed edge - on , provides the long amplification pathlengths and the beaming geometry necessary to produce high - brightness temperature maser features .",
    "slower , non - dissociative c - type shocks may also produce conditions conducive to water maser emission ( @xcite ) , and may be necessary to explain the observed strength of higher energy level water maser transitions in star - forming regions in our galaxy ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of strong h@xmath21 emission ( @xcite ) , high - velocity outflows ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , and dense molecular gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) all suggest that molecular shocks are present in the nucleus of ngc  3079 .    how might shocks be driven in ngc  3079 ?",
    "we suggest a model in which the masers lie in the inner parsec of a dense molecular disk that is shocked by interaction with a loosely collimated nuclear wind .",
    "if we assume that the orientation of the inner parsec of the molecular disk in ngc  3079 is the same as observed on larger scales , _",
    "i.e. _ nearly edge - on with a position angle of @xmath89 ( @xcite ) , then it is clear that the nuclear jet , traced by the compact continuum sources , is not perpendicular to the disk .",
    "we suggest that the jet is surrounded by a loosely collimated outflow , or `` sheath '' , which disturbs regions of the disk lying under the jet , driving turbulence and shocks that give rise to maser emission .",
    "centrifugally - driven outflows from the innermost regions of magnetized accretion disks may be a common feature in agn ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , and could be a source of the hypothesized jet sheath .",
    "note that an outflow originating in the inner accretion disk will not remain axisymmetric about the jet axis , but be redirected along the minor axis of the galaxy , since motion in the plane of the dense molecular disk will be impeded .",
    "the redirected outflow will then feed into the kpc - scale radio lobes observed to extend along the minor axis of ngc  3079 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ; @xcite ) . while certainly not the only conceivable interpretation , this model has the attractive quality of reducing the complexity of the nucleus of ngc  3079 to two relatively simple entities : a dense molecular disk , and a misaligned jet with an associated sheath - like outflow .",
    "irwin & sofue ( 1992 ) detected a kinematic component of co gas that is distinct from the rotating molecular disk , extending along the jet axis defined by the compact radio continuum sources .",
    "( note that this component accounts for the apparent warp in the disk reported by sofue & irwin [ 1992 ] . )",
    "this indicates that molecular gas is somehow being entrained by the jet outflow .",
    "the emission we observe at 1123 and 1040  along the jet axis ( figure  [ fg - bigmap ] ) suggests that the entrainment may begin within one parsec of the central engine , where the gas density is highest .",
    "other galaxies exhibit similar characteristics .",
    "broad linewidth water maser emission is observed extending along the axis of a jet in the liner ngc  1052 ( @xcite ) , while in ngc  1068 , maser emission marks the deflection of the nuclear jet by a molecular cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it appears that the interaction of jets with ambient molecular gas is responsible for at least some of the water maser emission seen in certain agn .",
    "the presence of water maser emission along the inner parsec of the jet in ngc  3079 lends further credence to the hypothesis that this jet is interacting with the ambient molecular material quite close to the central engine , and may be responsible for exciting the brighter emission presumed to lie in the disk itself .",
    "an agn disk wind will be ionized , and so lines - of - sight passing through the outflow will suffer free - free absorption . if the molecular disk is inclined so that the western side is the closer , the orientation of the jet is such that maser emission from the northern , blue - shifted side of the disk will not be absorbed . the red - shifted emission on the south side ,",
    "however , will have to traverse the ionized sheath and may be heavily absorbed .",
    "this could explain the asymmetry between the blue- and red - shifted emission in ngc  3079 .",
    "the presence of multiple continuum jet components may indicate that the outflow occurs in intermittent bursts ; the separation of blue - shifted maser emission into two distinct clusters may be an effect of two distinct `` gusts '' of wind from the inner accretion disk .",
    "we note , however , that no continuum source analagous to component was detected to the nw of component , and that the multiple features may trace standing shocks in the jet rather than intermittent outflow .",
    "although the relative distribution of red- and blue - shifted maser emission in ngc  3079 is consistent with their lying in a roughly edge - on rotating disk , the rotation curve is masked by the the large peculiar velocities of individual features .",
    "most notably , the large spread in doppler velocity ( @xmath90  ) of features in the main cluster containing the maser peak suggests that they are embedded in a region of supersonic turbulence .",
    "such a situation has also been observed in the galactic star - forming region w49n , where measurement of proper motions of water maser spots has allowed the determination of their true , three - dimensional spatial velocities ( @xcite )",
    ". statistical analysis of these velocities and the angular distribution of these spots indicates that they are embedded in supersonic turbulence , which may be caused by fluid instabilities in the boundary layer between the ambient medium and a bipolar outflow driven by a young stellar jet ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar situation may be occuring in ngc  3079 .",
    "instabilities in the boundary layer between a nuclear wind and the disk could result in supersonic turbulence .",
    "dense clouds embedded in this turbulence could then collide , producing shocks and maser features over a wide range of radial velocities ( @xcite ) .",
    "several authors have considered the acceleration of dense maser clouds by a high - velocity , low - density wind ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . rescaling the wind model predictions of duric & seaquist ( 1988 ) for our adopted distance of 16  mpc",
    ", we estimate a mass - loss rate for the wind of approximately @xmath91  yr , and an outflow velocity of about 5000  . taking a typical maser cloud to have a diameter of 0.02  pc ( a typical clump size in ngc  3079 ) , a molecular hydrogen number density of @xmath92  @xmath16 , and a distance from the nucleus of 0.5  pc , the ram pressure from this wind is capable of accelerating the cloud to a velocity of 50  over a distance of 0.05  pc on a timescale of @xmath10  yr .",
    "however , it is not clear that non - gravitationally bound clouds can survive being accelerated in this fashion ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the masers in some agn could arise in clouds lifted off the surface of an accretion disk by a centrifugally - driven wind ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic pressure gradients ( the so - called `` melon seed '' force ) and radiation pressure on embedded dust are other possible acceleration mechanisms .",
    "alternatively , the clouds could form in the outflow itself via hydrodynamical instabilities , eliminating the need for an acceleration mechanism .",
    "a shell driven into the ambient medium can fragment into dense clumps via rayleigh - taylor and thermal instabilities ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have found no evidence that the unusually bright h@xmath21o maser emission in ngc  3079 is beamed amplification of high brightness temperature 22  ghz continuum emission ; the 22  ghz continuum peak lies @xmath93  pc east of the maser peak in projection .",
    "both continuum components  and  appear to have inverted spectra between 5 and 8  ghz , and , assuming no intrinsic variability , spectral turnovers between 8 and 22  ghz .",
    "these spectra may indicate synchrotron self - absorption , or free - free absorption in ionized ambient nuclear gas .",
    "this source may be a low - luminosity , nearby example of the class of compact , symmetric , gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio galaxies .",
    "component  shows substructure at 8  ghz that is suggestive of a jet lobe .",
    "component  is somewhat more compact , but also exhibits structure at 8 and 22  ghz . a third continuum component ( )",
    "was identified at 5  ghz ; it lies 4  pc se of  along the  axis , appears to have a flatter spectrum than  or , given its non - detection at 8  ghz .",
    "the detection of a third component along the continuum axis lends support to the idea that these represent features in a nuclear jet rather than , for instance , physically unconnected starburst regions .",
    "it appears that none of these three sources marks the nuclear engine of ngc  3079 , which may be heavily absorbed . a more extended source ( )",
    "was detected at 22  ghz only ; it may in fact be weak water maser emission that is amplifying undetected background continuum .",
    "water maser features in ngc  3079 trace a roughly north - south extended structure , consistent with the emission arising in a nearly edge - on disk aligned with the kiloparsec - scale molecular disk .",
    "the distribution of red- and blue - shifted maser features is consistent with rotation in the same sense as the larger disk , with a binding mass on the order of @xmath94 .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion of clumps within the distribution , and the suggestion of internal velocity gradients within the clumps , indicate that non - rotational , possibly turbulent motions are significant",
    ". the masers may arise in shocks driven by a wide opening - angle nuclear wind .",
    "two additional features were observed along the axis of the nuclear jet , and may represent a second population of maser emission .",
