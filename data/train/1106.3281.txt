    "up to date , the set of planetary systems discovered orbiting around single stars , similar to the sun , in the solar neighborhood , ascends to 315 ( http://exoplanets.org/ ) , of which 237 are apparently single - planet systems , while the remaining 78 are multiple - planet systems .",
    "the first multiple planetary system discovered orbiting a single star , was the one around @xmath0 , which up to date harbor two confirmed planets of masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 jupiter masses ( @xmath3 ) and semi - major axis @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively @xcite and one inferred planet of @xmath6 located at @xmath7 from the central star @xcite , which means that this planetary system host three giant planets located at distances greater than @xmath8 from the central star . on the other extreme , another example is the system @xmath9 , which houses four planets ( two giant planets , one neptune and one super - earth ) located at distances less than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "there are also examples of systems with a hot - jupiter and another giant planet , located away from the central star at a distance greater than @xmath8 , as the system @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "as seen in these examples , the planetary systems population is remarkably diverse .",
    "it displays a wide range of architectures with properties that reflects the environment where they were born and the different mechanisms of formation and evolution and are of special interest to test theoretical models of planetary system formation .",
    "all the information provided by the observations of planetary systems has not still been analyzed by theoretical models , although in recent years there have been a few works dealing with planetary systems formation and evolution , that intend to explain some of the observed trends of planetary systems .",
    "such is the work of @xcite , who present self consistent numerical simulations of planetary systems formation and study specifically how the properties of a mature planetary system map to those of its birth disc .",
    "@xcite developed a semi - analytical code for planetary systems formation , where they include the effect of resonant capture between embryos during type i migration and the calculation of embryos orbital and mass evolution after the gas depletion .",
    "their aim was to show that the formation of super - earths close to the star is possible and that they are more common than hot - jupiters .",
    "nevertheless , questions as : how common are the planetary systems like our own in the solar neighborhood ?",
    ", what factors influence the architecture of planetary systems ?",
    ", what are the differences and similarities between planetary systems ? and which is diversity of planetary systems expected to be find in the solar neighborhood ?",
    ", remain uncertain .    with these questions in mind , is our main objective to explore the importance of several factors in defining the architecture of a planetary system .",
    "we also intend to explain the observed diversity of planetary systems and link them to their birth environment .",
    "we explore different gas and solids disc profiles , as well as different planetary migration rates , to find out which factors reproduce the different planetary systems observed . according to this , and based on the protoplanetary discs observational data , we predict the systems that will be the more common and thus those expected to be found in the solar neighborhood . in this way",
    ", we intend to unveil , whether our solar system is a rarity or more planetary systems like our own are expected to be found in the near future .",
    "we also analyze which is the more favourable environment for the formation of habitable planets .",
    "based on the most accepted scenario for explaining the formation of planetary systems , our semi - analytical model adopts the core instability model for giant planet formation . in this scenario ,",
    "the mass distribution in the protoplanetary disc is important , since it defines the number and location of the final giant planets that would define the architecture of the planetary system .",
    "so we consider a large range of discs sizes and masses according to recent protoplanetary discs observations @xcite and assume a nebula with a surface density profile motivated by similarity solutions for viscous accretion discs @xcite , which intend to be simple but is a computationally feasible description , consistent with protoplanetary discs observations .",
    "our embryos start growing in the oligarchic growth regime @xcite and if they are able to accrete gas , their gaseous envelope will grow according to a prescription found from results obtained by @xcite . as the embryos are embedded in a gaseous disc",
    ", we also include the effects of their mutual interaction , considering type i and ii regimes of planetary migration .",
    "we found that those planetary systems that host small rocky planets are the most common in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "these `` low mass planet systems '' are the only ones that form in a low metallicity environment and represent the best site for the formation and developing of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone .",
    "the final number of embryos that harbor these planetary systems is strongly dependent on the initial disc profile and migration rate assumed .",
    "another striking result is that planetary systems similar to our solar system are expected to be common in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "these systems are formed in massive discs , whith no preferential areas for the accumulation of solids .",
    "finally , we found that those planetary systems with only hot ( @xmath11 ) and warm ( @xmath12 ) jupiter planets , need a very massive , metal - rich disc to be formed and also a fast migration rate .",
    "our results are consistent with the observational trend and show that most of these systems harbor only one giant planet .",
    "we have developed a semi analytical model for planetary systems formation .",
    "this model was explained in detail in our previous work @xcite , in this section we will summarize it for completeness .      the minimum mass solar nebula model ( mmsn ) of @xcite is usually used for modeling the protoplanetary nebula .",
    "as was explained in previous works @xcite this model suffers from multiple limitations . in order to avoid these limitations",
    ", we adopt a different model to represent the initial protoplanetary disc structure .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the gaseous surfece density of the disc is ,    @xmath13    expression based on the work of @xcite . in the equation , @xmath14 is a parameter introduced to smoothly end the disc and is fitted from the observations , the @xmath15 exponent indicates how the material is distributed on the disc and @xmath16 is a constant value , which is calculated from the disc s mass and also depends on the characteristic radius , and on the adopted disc profile .    in a similar way",
    "the solid surface density distribution , @xmath17 , is    @xmath18    with @xmath19 a function which is @xmath20 inside the snow line and @xmath21 outside it , representing the change in the solids due to water condensation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the relation between the gas and solids surface density distribution gives the abundance of heavy elements . for the case of a disc orbiting a star with metallicity @xmath22 $ ]",
    ", it is @xcite ,    @xmath23}= z_0 10^{[fe / h]}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the primordial abundance of heavy elements in the sun that was found to be @xmath25 by @xcite . in this work",
    "we will assume that the stellar metallicities follow a log - normal distribution fitted from the results of the coralie sample @xcite .",
    "recent protoplanetary discs observations show that the exponent in the inner part of the disc ( @xmath15 ) takes values between @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite . following these observations and with the end of comparing with the minimum mass solar nebula case ,",
    "we explore three different values for this exponent : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the sample of discs generated , have masses that follows a log - gaussian distribution fitted from recent protoplanetary discs observations @xcite .",
    "since gravitational instabilities can occur in any region of the disc if it becomes cool enough or the mass distribution is really high , then we check the stability of the discs generated . in the linear regime ,",
    "the gravitational instability limit is given by the toomre - parameter @xcite ,    @xmath30    with @xmath31 the epicyclic frequency of the disc .",
    "when the discs are keplerian , then @xmath32 and the q parameter is    @xmath33    where a value of @xmath34 represents an unstable disc .    as shown in the equation , the disc stability depends on the initial disc profile , so discs with the same mass could be stable or unstable depending on the value of @xmath15 adopted .",
    "those discs characterized by @xmath35 are much more massive in the outer disc than those characterized by larger values of @xmath15 . as a consequence , discs with relatively small mass and @xmath35",
    "could develop gravitational instabilities , while discs with higher values of @xmath15 require a larger disc mass in order to undergo gravitational instabilities . as a result , we found that when the highest value of @xmath15 is considered ( @xmath36 ) , there are discs with masses up to @xmath37 that present vaues of @xmath38 in the entire disc",
    ". these extremely massive discs should not be consider as keplerian . in order to avoid these discs ,",
    "we add another condition for the stability .",
    "we assume that a disc is stable if @xmath38 and its mass do not exceed the @xmath39 of the mass of the central star @xcite .",
    "the location of the inner boundary of the dust disc was found by @xcite , through observations of young stellar objects and is ,    @xmath40    with @xmath41 the dust sublimation temperature taken as @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the stellar and sun luminosity respectively . though @xcite found that this is the inner radius of the dust disc , we adopt this value to represent the end of both discs .",
    "we locate one initial embryo at the inner radius and the others are separated a distance @xmath45 from each other until the end of the disc is reached .",
    "this outer edge is the one that contains @xmath46 of the total disc mass , so it is not always the same and as result the initial number of embryos , @xmath47 , will be different according to the disc initial properties .",
    "as was shown in our previous work @xcite , the greater the mass of the disc , the lower the initial number of embryos .",
    "this is because the separation between the embryos of mass @xmath48 is    @xmath49    this separation is greater as the larger is the initial mass of the embryo and as a result masive discs have a less @xmath47 .",
    "finally our discs are not time invariant .",
    "we model the evolution of the gaseous disc with a very simple exponential decay model , which empties the gaseous disc everywhere in time - scales between @xmath50 and @xmath51 years in agreement to observation of circumstellar discs @xcite .",
    "the discs of solids change locally due to the accretion of the embryos .      in the beginning",
    "there are @xmath47 initial embryos embedded in a swarm of planetesimals in a gaseous disc .",
    "these embryos will grow due to the accretion of solids , gas and also due to the merger with other embryos .",
    "the relative velocity between the embryo and the neighbors planetesimals is an important factor in determining different regimes of embryo growth .",
    "our model begins when the cores have enough mass for increasing the velocity dispersion of the surrounding planetesimals , fact that leads to a slow regime that will dominate the embryo growth .",
    "this is the oligarchic growth regime @xcite .",
    "the initial mass necessary for exciting the neighbor planetesimals and turn on the oligarchic growth regime was found by @xcite and is given by ,    @xmath52    with m the effective planetesimal mass .",
    "the solid accretion rate in this regime of growth depends on the radius ( @xmath53 ) and total mass of the planet and the velocity dispersion ( @xmath54 ) which in turn depends on the planetesimals eccentricity .",
    "following @xcite the embryo eats planetesimals on a rate :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the kepler frequency .",
    "as the solid accretion rate depends on the planetesimals eccentricity , we assume that they reached an equilibrium value due to the balance between the protoplanets gravitational perturbations and the gas drag effect @xcite .",
    "the accretion of solids ends when the solid surface density is equal to zero , it means that the embryos consume most of the planetesimals available in their feeding zone and scattered the others @xcite .    up to",
    "now we assume that the only mechanism for the growth of the embryos is the accretion of small planetesimals , but they also can grow due to collisions with other embryos .",
    "this is a very important effect that suffer most of the embryos @xcite and determines their final characteristics .",
    "the giant impacts between embryos result in the merger of the cores and therefore represent a sudden and big increase in the mass of the embryo .",
    "we assume that when two cores are located at a distance less than 3.5 hill radius they will collide and merge @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we consider that when the embryos have enough mass to be able to retain a gaseous atmosphere , this gas increases the collision cross section of the embryo and the solid accretion rate is enhanced . at first , this gaseous envelope is able to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium , but when the core reaches a critical mass , the envelope can no longer be maintain by hydrostatic equilibrium and the gas accretion onto the core begins @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we assume a simplified formula for this critical mass given by ,    @xmath57    the gaseous envelope contracts on its own , on a time - scale given by the following formula that we obtained by fitting the results of the self - consistent code develop by @xcite ,    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the mass of the surrounding envelope and @xmath60 is its characteristic kelvin - helmholtz growth time - scale given by ,    @xmath61      while the embryos are managed to form , their are embedded in a gaseous disc which interacts with the cores , leading to a orbital evolution of the embryos called planetary migration .",
    "there are different regimes of planetary migration .",
    "we assume that our cores migrate due to type i and ii planetary migration as is explained in the following .",
    "[ [ migration - type - i . ] ] migration type i. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this regime acts on low mass planets , which are treated as a small perturbation and the linearized hydrodynamic equations are solved for the disc response .",
    "this regime was studied by @xcite and leads to an orbital motion of the embryos towards the central star .",
    "following @xcite the migration rate is ,    @xmath62 \\bigg(\\frac{m_t}{m_{\\star}}\\bigg ) \\frac{\\sigma_g\\ , a^2}{m_{\\star}}\\bigg(\\frac{a\\omega_k}{c_s}\\bigg)^2 a\\ , \\omega_k\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 as the time scale for type i migration can be shorter than the disc lifetime , the factor @xmath64 is introduced for considering effects that might stop or slow down migration ( e.g.,@xcite ) without introducing a mayor degree of complexity to the model .",
    "[ [ migration - type - ii ] ] migration type ii + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when we are in the presence of a very massive embryo the problem can no longer be treated as linear and then the disc response should be treated as a non linear case .",
    "this is the type ii migration regime @xcite , which for a disc with a viscosity characterized by @xmath65 , is @xcite ,    @xmath66    @xmath67    where , @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the gaseous disc depletion time - scale .",
    "the embryos stop migrating when they reach the inner edge of the disc .",
    "our main objective is to know which is the typical composition and architecture that is expected to be found in a planetary system . to accomplish this goal and following earlier work of @xcite",
    ", we performed a series of monte carlo numerical simulations .",
    "we assume different unknown parameters , such as the density profile and the type i migration rate , in order to compare with the observations and find out which suits better the observational sample of planetary systems .",
    "following recent results in observations in protoplanetary discs @xcite , we assumed that the exponent which characterizes the distribution of mass in the inner part of the disc adopts three values : @xmath70 and @xmath29 . on the other hand",
    "we suppose that the type i migration rate can be slow down 10 and 100 times , but we also analyze the cases when it is not delayed and when planetary migration is not considered .",
    "furthermore , we are also interested in finding out which are the parameters that link a planetary system with its birth disc and define the planetary system main characteristics . in order to study this problem ,",
    "in each simulation we generate 1000 planetary systems , where the initial conditions for each birth disc are taken random from :    * the time - scale for the gas depletion , has a uniform log distribution between @xmath50 and @xmath51 years . *",
    "the stellar mass has a uniform distribution in log scale in the range of @xmath71 . *",
    "the distribution of metallicities of solar - like stars in the solar neighborhood follows a gaussian distribution with @xmath72 and dispersion 0.22 @xcite . * the total mass of the disc is well approximated by a log - gaussian distribution with mean @xmath73 and dispersion @xmath74 .",
    "we obtained this value by assuming a log - gaussian distribution and performed a non - linear least square fit to the sample observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* the characteristic radius , @xmath14 is also well approximated by a log - gaussian distribution with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this distribution was obtained with the same procedure described in the previous item .",
    "we want to know how many of these planetary systems generated in our simulations match with an observed one .",
    "so , with the aim of comparing with the observations , we assumed that an observed planetary system matches quantitatively with an artificial one , when the masses and semi - major axis of its giant planets are the same to less than 10% . up to date",
    ", there are 315 planetary systems found orbiting a single star , similar to the sun , 66% of them could be reproduced quantitatively by our simulations .",
    "the remaining 33% are multiple planetary systems , where we could not find artificial systems whose planets match exactly the mass and semi - major axis than observed , although we have found qualitatively similar systems , that will be shown in the next section , where we also analyze the different architectures found , the characteristics of the simulated planetary systems , and how this final characteristics map the discs where they were born .",
    "so far , more than 300 planetary systems have been found orbiting a single star .",
    "these planetary systems present different characteristics and with the end of understanding their formation , composition and relation with their birth disc , it is appropriate to classify them according to their architecture .",
    "since most of the observed planets are giant planets , we use them for the planetary systems classification . in order to determine which mass is the appropriate for separating planets into giant planets and low mass planets , we look from the theoretical point of view .",
    "planets with masses larger than @xmath77 have reached the crossover mass , which means that the runaway gas accretion process has began .",
    "this process ends only when there is no residual gas in the disc or a gap form near planet s orbit , so planets with masses larger than @xmath78 are giant planets or failed giant planets ( = neptunes ) .",
    "these are the planets considered for our classification .    on the other hand , based on the observations , we note that these planets are located either near the central star ( at distances less than @xmath8 ) , in an intermediate zone or far away ( at a distances larger than @xmath79 ) , a fact that is the basis of our classification .",
    "then we separate all the planetary systems according to the following classification :    * * `` hot and warm jupiter systems '' * : these planetary systems host planets with masses larger than @xmath78 at a distance less than @xmath8 . *",
    "* `` solar systems '' * : a planetary system is an analog of our solar system if it harbors giant planets or neptunes located between @xmath21 and @xmath79 . *",
    "* `` combined systems '' * : these planetary systems harbor at least one giant planet within @xmath8 and at least one in the middle part of the disc , between @xmath21 and @xmath79 . *",
    "* `` cold - jupiter systems '' * : if the giant planets are located further from @xmath79 then it is a cold - jupiter system .",
    "* * `` low mass planet systems '' * : these systems have only planets with masses less than @xmath78 .    in the table [ estadistica - observados ]",
    "we show the statistics of the population of planetary systems observed . in order to compare with our population of artificial planetary systems we eliminate of the observational sample those planetary systems formed around binary or multiple stars , as well as those where the mass of the central star is less than @xmath80 or greater than @xmath81 .",
    "the total number of observed planetary systems analyzed in the table is 315 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that most of the planetary systems are hot and warm jupiters systems , but we also found a large percentage of planetary systems analogs to the solar system , although these do not harbor planets like the earth , or these were not detected yet .",
    "it must be noticed that this sample is biased towards those planets that are easier to be detected with the current observational techniques , but we hope that in the near future planets like our own will be easier to be detected and this will improve the statistics , but in the meantime some predictions can be made about what we hope to find .    to this end , in the following we will explore the statistics of the population of planetary systems found in our simulations .",
    "tables [ estadisticagama05 ] , [ estadisticagama1 ] and [ estadisticagama15 ] , show the percentage of different kinds of planetary systems found when assuming different initial disc profiles : @xmath35,@xmath21 and @xmath29 respectively . in each table , we show the statistics when different migration rates are considered . we perform simulations without migration and adopting different type i migration rates , which are indicated in the different columns .    _",
    "the first striking result is that in all cases , speaking of all discs ( @xmath35 , @xmath21 or @xmath29 ) and all the migration rates ( without migration and when @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath21 ) , it is always the planetary systems with small planets which are the vast majority .",
    "_ this means that these systems are the invisible majority , because none of them has been detected yet .",
    "but if the observational techniques allowed it , a lot of them would be detected and this is what we expect to find in the close future .",
    "we also noticed that we found zero cold - jupiters systems in all the analyzed cases .",
    "this is because the core instability model allows the formation of giant planets close to the star , being the snow line the preferred zone @xcite , which is believed to be initially located in the inner part of the disc .",
    "this model for planetary formation can not explain the formation of planets as far as @xmath79 .",
    "another possibility could be that the planet migrates outward , which could occur if it shares a resonance with another giant planet and the inner one is significantly more massive than the outer one @xcite .",
    "finally , we should consider the possibility that the planet may have formed in the inner planetary system and then ejected outwards .",
    "nevertheless , none of these hypotheses are addressed in our study .",
    "therefore , we need a different scenario to explain the origin of these giant planets , as could be a different mechanism of formation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or migration , or consider the formation and subsequent ejection of the planets towards the outer system @xcite",
    ".    finally we point out that as we note in tables [ estadisticagama05 ] , [ estadisticagama1 ] and [ estadisticagama15 ] , there are failed planetary systems . these systems were born in very low mass discs , which did not allow the formation of objects with masses larger than planet mercury s mass .",

    "different columns show the results when different parameters for delaying type i migration are considered . in the first column",
    "the migration was not considered , in the second column @xmath92 , in the third column @xmath93 and the last case shows the histograms when migration is not delayed .",
    "we note that the number of giant planets that harbor a hot and warm jupiter system is strongly dependent on the type i migration rate assumed .",
    "when the migration is not considered ( first column ) , all the hot and warm jupiter systems harbor only one giant planet . these are planets that were formed in situ and , as seen in the previous section , these systems are very rare",
    ".    when migration is considered but delayed 100 times ( second column ) , there are hot and warm jupiter systems which harbor two giant planets , but only those systems that were formed assuming an steeper disc profile ( @xmath87 or @xmath29 ) .",
    "a disc characterized by a profile with an exponent in the inner part given by @xmath87 or @xmath36 , is a disc that favors the formation of giant planets and because planets form closer to the star than when @xmath35 , the migration push them towards the star and the system becomes a hot and warm jupiter system .    in the third column",
    "the migration is delayed only 10 times , and we note that when the migration is faster , all the explored disc profiles formed hot and warm jupiter systems with two giant planets .    finally , the last column shows the results when the migration is not reduced .",
    "we note that @xmath35 is the only case when two giant planets are allowed to form .",
    "this is because the giant planets are formed further from the central star than in the other cases , and although the fast migration inhibits the growth , they could grow by colliding with other embryos on its path .",
    "nevertheless , in this case the percentage of planetary systems with two giant planets is really small , less than @xmath94 .",
    "then a fast migration rate does not favour the formation of several giant planets either .",
    "we see that a migration so fast inhibits the embryo s growth , which is why several giant planets in the same system are not allowed to form and as a result all the hot and warm jupiter systems host only one giant planet .    as a general conclusion ,",
    "we note that in all cases analyzed , most of the hot and warm jupiter systems are composed by only one giant planet , which is also a tendency of the current observational data @xcite .",
    "so far , 99 of the observed planetary systems around single stars , could be classified as solar systems .",
    "these 99 systems represent @xmath95 of all the planetary systems found , as was shown in table [ estadistica - observados ] .",
    "figure [ compara - ss ] shows a qualitative comparison between some examples of observed solar systems , which are shown in the first column and where only the giant planets are plotted , and some generated with our simulations , shown in the second column . in the figure ,",
    "the semi - major axis of the planets are indicated in the x - axis , while their mass is represented with the different sizes of the black circles and printed above each planet .",
    "as seen in the figure the observational sample of solar systems can be reproduced qualitatively by our simulations .        in the figure ,",
    "the artificial solar system shown in the first row , was formed considering that @xmath87 and @xmath93 . in the second row ,",
    "the solar system was generated assuming @xmath35 and @xmath93 .",
    "as seen in both cases , a flat disc is needed , in order to form these systems .",
    "this is because a small value of @xmath15 , favors the formation of several giant planets further from the central star .",
    "if a solar system was born from a disc with a great accumulation in the inner disc , as is the case when @xmath36 , which is also the case most similar to the minimum mass solar nebula model of @xcite , a very slow or zero migration is required in order to the giant planets formed in the ice line to stay there and do not become hot - jupiters .",
    "that is precisely what is observed in the artificial system formed in the third row , which was generated assuming a disc profile characterized by @xmath36 and where the planetary migration was not considered .",
    "finally , the planetary system formed in the fourth row , was born in a disc characterized by @xmath87 and where the embryos do not migrate , which is consistent with the preferred scenario for the formation of these systems .",
    "we can not ignore our own solar system , so a qualitatively comparison of our planetary system compared to a generated one is shown in figure [ sistemasolar ] .",
    "the distance between the planet and its central star is shown in the x - axis and its mass is shown with the different size of the circle and it is also written for each planet .        in the figure only jupiter and saturn are shown , because we do not found any artificial planetary system with the exact mass and location of all the giant planets in our solar system .",
    "then , the solar system shown in the figure , harbors only two giant planets that match with our solar system . for the formation of the artificial solar system",
    "we assume that @xmath35 and the planetary migration is not considered .",
    "as was said , a system with a very large value of @xmath15 do not favor the formation of several giant planets in the same system and located further away from the central star . on the other hand",
    "a faster migration rate would locate the planets in the inner disc and the system would became a hot and warm jupiter system .",
    "so a small value of @xmath15 and a slow migration rate are the best conditions when trying to reproduce our solar system .",
    "looking at the architecture of the 100 solar systems detected so far ( where we include our solar system ) , it can be noticed that only five of them have more than one giant planet , in addition , and with the exception of our solar system , all of them harbor two giant planets .",
    "since we do not know if this sample is representative of all solar systems or is due to an observational bias , we analyze statistically our numerical results .",
    "figure [ histo - ss ] displays histograms showing the percentage of solar systems that harbor one , two or three planets with masses larger than @xmath96 .",
    "this figure is analog to the figure [ histo - hj ] , where the columns show the results when diferent migration rates are considered and the three rows show the results when different disc profiles are assumed .",
    "the figure shows that solar systems with 2 giant planets are pretty common and those with three giant planets are very rare .",
    "this is because according to the core instability model , to form two giant planets , a large amount of solid material is needed .",
    "this allow the rapid formation of very massive cores , which start the gas accretion , becoming a giant planets .",
    "this usually occurs in the snow line region , which is the preference formation zone for these planets .",
    "if the disc is very massive and has a high metallicity , another giant planet could be formed , which does not ocurr in most cases .",
    "the first row shows the results when the initial density profile of the disc is characterized by an exponent of @xmath35 .",
    "the density profile in these discs is very smooth and there is no accumulation of gas and solids in the inner disc . as a consequence ,",
    "the formation of giant planets may occur farther from the central star than in the case of steeper profiles .",
    "the migration move them towards the star but it is not enough to locate them inside @xmath8 and for these reason these systems remain as solar systems . since in this case",
    "the formation of several planets further from the central star is favored , in some cases there are more solar systems with two giant planets , than those formed with a sinlge one .",
    "when the density profile is a bit steeper , @xmath87 , we note that , there are still several planetary systems with two giant planets , even with three in some few cases , so this disc profile also allows the formation of several giant planets per disc .",
    "finally , in the case of the steepest profile ( @xmath36 ) we see that the overall percentage of systems with multiple giant planets have fallen compared with previous cases , because a larger amount of solids in the inner part of the disc promotess the formation of a single giant planet per disc @xcite .",
    "these systems represent an intermediate class between the hot and warm jupiter systems and those analogous to the solar system .",
    "since belonging to this class implies the presence of at least one planet within @xmath97 and at least one outside , all these systems have two or more planets with masses greater than @xmath78 .",
    "our results agree with the observations regarding the frequency of these systems , although it could be a coincidence due to an observational bias . according to the observations ,",
    "@xmath98  % of planetary systems discovered so far belong to this class , while our simulations show that in no case combined systems generated exceed the @xmath99  % of the artificial sample .",
    "figure [ mixtos - cualitativo ] is analogous to figure [ compara - hj ] , but in this case we show a comparison of combined systems .",
    "as seen in the figure , the combined systems generated in our simulations match qualitatively with the observed systems , so that the architecture of these systems can be explained by the core accretion model and the current models of planetary migration .",
    "it is also noticed that while these systems belong to the same class , they are qualitatively different , because multiple factors determine the final architecture of a planetary system .",
    "some of these factors are the initial mass of the disc , the metallicty , the gaseous disipation time - scale , the distribution of gas and solids along the disc and the migration time scale .",
    "the first row shows a system with two giant planets in which the mass of the inner planet is smaller than the mass of the exterior one .",
    "the artificial system was created with a disc characterized by a profile with @xmath87 and a slow migration rate ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "this system was formed in a disc with a smooth profile , where the more massive planet was formed in the region of greatest accumulation of solids ( the snow line ) , while the lower mass planet was formed closer to the central star , inside the snow line .",
    "since the migration was delayed 100 times , these planets did not move too far from the region where they were born .",
    "we also found systems such as the one shown in the second row , where the mass of the planets also grows outward but in this case the difference between the mass of the inner and outer planet is much greater than in the previous case .",
    "the artificial system was created with a profile characterized by @xmath36 and slow migration ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this disc profile is characterized by a great accumulation of solids in inner disc , specially at the snow line , causing the rapid formation of the most massive planet in this region .",
    "the lower mass planet was formed closer to the central star and as the profile allows a higher concentration of solids in the interior compared to the case of lower @xmath15 profiles , migration is also faster , so this planet migrate towards the star , on its path it collide with other embryos and increase its core s mass , being able to accrete gas before it is depleted and form a large gaseous envelope .",
    "the planetary systems shown in the third row also shows that the mass grows outward , but in this case the systems harbor 4 planets with masses larger than @xmath78 and all of them have masses less than @xmath101 .",
    "the simulated system was generated assuming that @xmath87 and a migration rate faster than in previous cases ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the flat disc profile allows the formation of several giant planets in the same disc , but the growth is slower with this disc profile and the planets have smaller masses when compared to the previous case .",
    "finally we found systems as those shown in rows 4 and 5 , where in both cases the mass grows inwards and the artificial systems where formed assuming a disc profile of @xmath87 and a faster migration rate of @xmath93 . in the case of planetary system generated in row 4 ,",
    "the most massive planet was born at the snow line and migrates inwards and the less massive planet was formed in outer regions with less gas and solids available to accrete .",
    "the system generated in the last row is a system where the embryos acquire most of its cores mass due to collisions with other embryos .",
    "then the more massive planet migrates until the end of the disc and accrete more solids than the others .",
    "we also noticed that in rows 3 and 5 , the systems were formed under identical parameters ( @xmath87 , @xmath93 ) , but they have an opposite correlation of mass and distance .",
    "this implies that other factors must lead to this difference .",
    "the sinthetic system in row 3 was formed in a disc with @xmath102 , @xmath103 and metellicity of @xmath104 .",
    "the system formed in row 5 was born in a @xmath105 disc , @xmath106 and metallicity@xmath107 .",
    "this means , that the system in row 5 had more solids and gas available to form the giant planets . in this masive disc ,",
    "the migration rate is faster ( because of the larger amount of solids ) and therefore the inner giant planet formed in the ice line and then migrated quickly , eating the other planets that might have formed there . in the meantime , the other giant planets formed farther from the star and migrated towards regions with a major solid surface density , growing in the process . on the other hand ,",
    "the system in row 3 have a lower disc mass and most important , the characteristic radius is much larger as in the previous case .",
    "this implies that the solids are spread over a much larger area and as a consecuence , the planetary migration was not so fast and the planets remained where they were born . as a conclusion we note that while the initial disc profile and the migration rate have a strong influence on the final architecture of the system , there are also other important parameters in defining it .",
    "this will be studied in section [ definiendo ] .",
    "low mass planet systems are those who does not host planets with masses larger than @xmath78 .",
    "although none of these systems was observed yet , as seen in tables [ estadisticagama05 ] , [ estadisticagama1 ] and [ estadisticagama15 ] , the majority of stars would not host giant planets , so this kind of planetary systems represent a substantial fraction of planetary systems which were not deeply studied yet .    in the standard scenario of rocky planets formation ,",
    "the finally stage is the giant impact regime . with our model",
    "we are able to study the firsts stages of rocky planets growth in the context of a disc where several cores are formed simultaneously . studying the last stage of rocky planets growth , implies a dynamic monitoring of phenomena such as resonant interactions important during last stages of their growth ( eg . , @xcite ) , which are not analyzed with our model .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our studies are an important complement to numerical dynamical studies that analyze last phases of growth , since we provide the initial conditions for these studies .    with the aim of analyzing the final number of planets found in a low mass planet system as a function of the initial mass of the protoplanetary disc ( @xmath108 )",
    ", we divide the planetary systems in three types and analyze the final number of planets found per system in each class .",
    "the first group are those low mass planet systems formed in low mass discs ( @xmath109 ) , which are the most common low mass planet systems .",
    "the second group are those formed in intermediate mass discs ( @xmath110 ) and the last group are the ones originated in very massive discs ( @xmath111 ) , which are the less common systems , that are characterised by small metallicities .",
    "these low mass planet systems formed in very massive discs are most common when the migration rate is faster , because this inhibit the growth of the embryos",
    ".    figures [ histo - pchicos - sinmig ] show histograms representing the final number of embryos per planetary system .",
    "these plots where made based on the results found when the planetary migration is not considered . in the figures ,",
    "the solid line shows the histogram for those planetary systems formed from a low mass disc , the gray dotted line represent the histogram for the systems that were born in an intermediate mass disc , and the black dotted line are the resulting histogram for very massive discs .",
    "as the planetary systems evolution is different when assuming different values for the @xmath15 exponent , figure [ histo - pch - gama05 ] shows the results when @xmath35 , figure [ histo - pch - gama1 ] show the histograms resulting when @xmath87 and when @xmath36 we found the results shown in figure [ histo - pch - gama15 ] .",
    "the most massive discs have a lower initial number of embryos because the separation between them is larger .",
    "this causes that , in massive discs , embryos must be more massive in order to collide with a neighbor core . when the disc profile is characterized by an exponent in the inner disc given by @xmath35 , it is a rather flat disc and the growth slows much more on the inside than it increases on the outside , when compared to discs with a larger @xmath15 . as a result",
    "the final number of embryos in these discs is greater than the number reached in low mass discs , as could be seen in figure [ histo - pch - gama05 ] .",
    "we note in the figure that most of the planetary systems formed in massive discs have between 20 and 25 final embryos , while those formed in low mass discs have between 10 and 20 rocky planets at the end of the simulation .",
    "when the profile is a bit steeper , @xmath112 this trend continues ( figure [ histo - pch - gama1 ] ) , but when the disc is characterized by a density profile of gas and solids with an exponent in the inner region of @xmath36 , the growth of the embryos is really fast , so the merger between the embryos is more frequent , and as a result the final number of embryos in massive discs is smaller than the final number in low mass discs ( figure [ histo - pch - gama15 ] ) .",
    "as seen in figures [ histo - pch - gama05 ] , [ histo - pch - gama1 ] and [ histo - pch - gama15 ] the final number of embryos is strongly dependent on the initial disc profile .",
    "nevertheless , this is not the only important factor , we are also interested in the effect of planetary migration in the final number of embryos .",
    "figure [ histo - pchicos ] shows which is the final number of planets per planetary system , when considering different migration rates and disc profiles .",
    "the columns represent different type i migration rates , where the first column shows the simulation results when @xmath92 , the second show the resulting histogram when the migration was delayed 10 times , and the last column represent the histograms when @xmath86 .",
    "the histograms in different rows , are the simulation results when different initial disc profiles are assumed ( in the first @xmath35 , in the second @xmath87 and in the last one @xmath36 ) .",
    "the interaction between an embryo and the surrounding gas , move the embryos towards the central star .",
    "this produces a higher number of collisions and the result of these mergers will be a smaller number of embryos at the end of the simulation .",
    "while this effect is important in determining the final number of embryos per planetary system , the migration rate depends on the disc profile , and as we note in previous figures , the separation between the embryos also depends on the value of @xmath15 adopted , so the final number of embryos depends on the migration rate considered , but also on the initial disc profile .",
    "when considering a profile characterized by @xmath35 , we note that when @xmath113 the histogram is similar to the case without migration , although in this case the majority of planetary systems formed in very massive discs host @xmath114 planets .",
    "when the migration is faster , @xmath115 , we note that the majority harbor between 15 and 20 final planets and when the migration is not delayed , most of planetary systems harbor less than 15 planets at the end of the simulation .    when the initial disc profile is characterized by @xmath87 and @xmath116 , we note that the majority of planetary systems formed from low massive discs harbor between 15 and 20 final planets , while most of the low mass planet systems formed from very massive discs end up with a number of planets between 5 and 10 . when the migration rate is faster , the disc mass is less important and most of the systems ( formed from any disc ) , harbor less than 15 planets at the end of the simulation . finally , when the migration is not slowed down , we see that the majority harbor less than 10 planets at the end of the simulation ( 20 million years ) .    the last row shows the histograms resulting when @xmath36 . in this case",
    "we note that even a slow migration ( @xmath113 ) , cause that most of systems formed from very massive discs harbor five planets at the end of the simulation . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of final planets formed in systems with low mass discs , remains larger .",
    "when the migration is faster ( @xmath117 , ) , most of the planetary systems formed from any disc host 10 planets at the end of the simulation . finally , when @xmath118 we observe that most of the systems formed in intermediate and low mass discs harbor between 5 and 10 planets while the vast majority of systems formed in very massive discs harbor less than 5 planets at the end of the simulation .",
    "this is a consequence of fast planetary migration .",
    "the migration is still more effective when the disc mass and solid surface density is higher , which is the case of this last figure .",
    "considerations of stellar flux and planet climate lead to the definition of the habitable zone as the region where an earth - like planet could support liquid water on its surface @xcite . according to this definition , for the range of stellar masses considered in this work",
    ", the habitable zone lies between @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "but the evolution of earth - like habitable planets is a complex process and locate a planet in the habitable zone is no guarantee for its habitability .",
    "although the potential habitability of an earth - like planet depends on many factors as the tidal heating @xcite , its geophysical environment and atmospheric evolution @xcite , the host star s activity and the planets intrinsic magnetic field @xcite , it is possible that planets in the habitable zone may contain water and host some life form . for this reason , missions that search for exoplanets intend to find small planets located in the habitable zone and the characterization of the stars and planetary systems that harbor them is important @xcite .    on the other hand gas giant planets are far easier than terrestrial planets to detect around other stars , and most of the planetary systems detected",
    "so far are formed mostly by giant planets .",
    "should we continue to monitor these systems in the search for planets like earth , or the presence of a gas giant inhibits the formation of a small planet in the habitable zone ? .",
    "when speaking of hot and warm jupiter systems , it is fairly clear that a migrating giant planet will cause any preexisting low - mass planets or planetesimals at smaller radii to be lost , either by accretion or scattering .",
    "what is not clear is whether a subsequent generation of planetesimals could form from the remnant disc after the giant path or if rocky planets formed farther out in the disc , subsequently migrate inward and locate at smaller radii and perhaps in the habitable zone .",
    "recent studies dealing with these issues present varying results . on the one hand in @xcite",
    ", he developed a simple model for the evolution of gas and solids in the disc and analyzed what remains after a massive planet migration .",
    "he found that the replenishment of solid material in the inner disc following giant planet inward migration , is generally inefficient and would not allow the formation of a second generation of habitable planets . on the other hand @xcite ,",
    "investigate the dynamics of post - migration planetary systems considering only one giant planet migrating and found that terrestrial accretion can occur during and after giant planet migration .",
    "as seen this issue is not settled yet , and depends on many factors such as the time - scale of gas dissipation and the rates of accretion and planetary migration .",
    "with our model we are not able to analyze the subsequent formation of small planets , but we can analyze if it is possible that earth - like planets formed at a larger radii could end in the habitable zone due to a subsequent migration . according to our model ,",
    "when a giant planet migrates towards the star the smaller embryos that found on its path are accreted or scattered into external orbits . according to this ,",
    "if we find an earth - like planet located in the habitable zone in a hot and warm jupiter system , this means that it was born at a larger radii ( further than the giant planet formation zone ) and a subsequent migration located it in the habitable zone .",
    "tables [ habitablesgama05 ] , [ habitablesgama1 ] and [ habitablesgama15 ] show the percentage of planetary systems found in our simulations that host planets woth masses less than @xmath78 , located between @xmath119 and @xmath120 , in all the cases analyzed .",

    "since the higher the density of gas in the disc , the faster the migration rate , those discs with softer density profiles , require a faster migration rate in order to move low mass planets in the habitable zone .",
    "for this reason , when @xmath35 habitable planets are only found in hot and warm jupiter systems when @xmath86 .",
    "when the disc density profile is sharper ( @xmath87 ) , low mass planets in the habitable zone are found also when @xmath93 and when @xmath36 , there are planets who reach the habitable zone even for a migration rate as slow as the case which was delayed 100 times .    on the other hand we note that low mass , potentially habitable planets are found preferably in planetary systems analogs to ours and also in low mass planet systems .",
    "these are the most favorable environments for the development of habitable planets .",
    "one of the key questions regarding planetary systems is how their properties reflect the conditions of their parent nebula .",
    "there are many key parameters which act for defining the architecture of a planetary system , here we explore the relevance of the initial disc mass , the characteristic radius , the metallicity , the time - scale of gas disc dissipation , the disc density distribution and migration rate .",
    "the mass of the disc and how it is distributed through the disc determines the material available for the growth of embryos .",
    "a low mass disc will form low mass planetary systems , while a massive disc will favor the formation of planetary systems with giant planets .",
    "the characteristic radius and exponent @xmath15 of the density profile , are important because they say where most of the disc mass is distributed .",
    "a disc with a large @xmath14 and small value of @xmath15 , is more extended and allows the formation of cores further form the central star , but since the mass is distributed over a larger radius in a flat disc , this do not favor the mass concentration and therefore the frequency of giant planetary formation decreases .",
    "figure [ md - rc ] shows the initial disc mass versus the characteristic radius of the disc , where each point represents a planetary system and we show the resulting planetary systems in all the cases considered in this work .",
    "the gray big dots are those planetary systems analogs to our solar system , the big black dots are the hot and warm jupiter systems and the small black dots show the low mass planet systems .",
    "we noticed that both the characteristic radius and the disc s mass come from certain distributions , as was seen in section [ resultados ] .",
    "this fact is folded into the graphics and should be taken into account .    according to our results shown in the figures , in the case of a disc with a profile characterized by an exponent @xmath35 on the inside ( shown in the first row of graphs )",
    ", a mass of at least @xmath121 is needed to allowing the formation of solar systems and their formation is favored when considering a slow migration rate .",
    "we also note that in this case there are very few hot and warm jupiter systems when the migration is slow and it increases when considering faster migration rates , but anyway , mass of at least @xmath122 is needed in order to allow the formation of this kind of systems .",
    "we note , however , that in the case of a migration rate delayed only 10 times , there are some systems that become hot and warm jupiter systems with small initial discs , so a rapid migration rate allows the formation of these systems even for a relatively small @xmath108 .",
    "it is also point out that in general , the formation of hot and warm jupiters and solar systems occurs preferably with a quite small @xmath14 , which is due to the fact that a lower @xmath14 favors the concentration of gas and solids and therefore the formation of giant planets .        in the second row",
    "we show the resulting planetary systems when @xmath87 is considered . in this case",
    "the disc present a larger density of solids and gas in the inner disc and as result a mass of @xmath123 is enough to form solar systems and there is no preferential @xmath14 to allow the formation of these systems .",
    "a larger population of hot and warm jupiter systems is found even when the migration is not acting , which implies that there are some initial discs which allow the formation in situ of these planets , but they are very rare .    finally in the last row the planetary systems found when @xmath36 are shown , where we note that these discs , which present a high abundance of gas and solids in the inner part , allow the formation of hot and warm jupiters and solar systems even when the disc mass is @xmath124 and for all @xmath14 .",
    "in general , it can be noticed that the disc s mass has a huge influence on defining the planetary system architecture , while the characteristics radius of the disc is not generally a relevant factor .",
    "precise spectroscopic studies biased toward high - metallicity stellar samples @xcite , those surveys who monitor stellar samples with low metallicities @xcite and other results with no bias @xcite , have demonstrated that stars with giant planets tend to be particularly metal - rich when compared to the average local field dwarfs .",
    "the physical mechanism for these correlation is of particular interest .",
    "one possible explanation could be that a high - metallicity protostellar cloud forms a metal - rich star and disc , and as an increased surface density of solids would facilitate the growth of embryonic cores then gas giant planet formation is greatly enhanced around more metal - rich stars .",
    "alternatively , enhanced stellar metallicity may be a by - product of late - stage accretion of gas - depleted material and then a high metallicity star does not necessarily imply that the initial disc was rich in solids .",
    "most evidences today suggest that the metallicity excess has a \" primordial  origin @xcite , and for this reason we assume that metal - rich star implies metal - rich discs , and thus the metal content of the cloud giving birth to the star and planetary system is indeed a key parameter to form a giant planet and determine the architecture of the planetary system .",
    "@xcite studied through numerical simulations the giant planet formation in metal rich discs .",
    "they found that since the solid accretion rate increases with the surface density of dust in the disc , the formation of gas giants tend to be more prolific in a metal rich environment .",
    "other authors find similar results @xcite .",
    "our results support this idea , but we also extend this study to the role of high metallicities on the diversity of planetary systems . in figure [ md - metal ] each dot represent a planetary system ( gray dots are the solar systems , big black dots are hot and warm jupiter systems and small black dots are low mass planet systems ) , with a characteristic disc mass and stellar metallicity .",
    "the rows show the resulting planetary systems for the different density profiles considered in this work and the columns show the results with different migration rates .        as seen in the figures , when @xmath35 ( first row ) a massive disc also needs a metallicity of at east @xmath125 in order to form solar systems and it has to be larger than @xmath126 to allow the formation of hot and warm jupiter systems .",
    "then a massive disc is not the only important feature when forming planetary systems with giant planets , a high metallicity disc is also needed .",
    "there are planetary systems formed in massive discs , but as they are characterized by low metallicities , they were not able to form giant planets and remained as low mass planet systems .    when @xmath87 , the density profile is steeper and this allow the formation of solar and hot and warm jupiter systems at lower metallicities . in this case",
    "the lower limit for solar systems formation is @xmath127 and the formation of hot and warm jupiter systems is allowed when @xmath22 \\ge -0.4 $ ] .    finally in the last case , when @xmath36 , the solid surface density profile of the disc are the sharpest , and this leads to a large concentration of solids in the inner disc , which allows the formation of hot and warm jupiter systems even for discs with metallicities of @xmath127 , while the lower limit for allowing the formation of solar systems is almost @xmath128 .",
    "a general result that we found , is that in most of the low metallicity discs , low mass planet systems are the most common systems , independently on the disc mass",
    ". this result could be in agreement with spectroscopic analysis found by @xcite and also with the results of surveys biased to low metallicity stars , which do not found giant planets on stars with low metallicities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we note that these observational results could mean that there are low mass planets around all these stars which were just not yet detected ( which is in agreement with our results ) or that these stars have be no planets at all .",
    "we also note that the higher the @xmath15 , the lower the metallicity limit for allowing the formation of giant planets . as a conclusion ,",
    "a density profile characterised by @xmath129 is in better agreement with the observations .",
    "loss of the gaseous component of protoplanetary discs is due to a combination of the accretion onto the central star @xcite , photoevaporation i.e. escape of the gaseous disc as a result of illumination by external @xcite or internal @xcite ionizing radiation .    according to observations in protoplanetary discs , the time - scales for the depletion of the gaseous component , ranges between 1 and 10 million of years @xcite .",
    "this time - scale is a key parameter in planetary systems formation because it sets a limit for the end of gas giant formation , affects the environment for terrestrial planet formation and determines the planetary migration as well .",
    "figure [ md - taugas ] is an analogous to figure [ md - metal ] , but in this case the gaseous disc characteristic time - scale vs disc mass is ploted .",
    "we note that when the density profiles is @xmath35 ( first row ) , there is no accumulation of solids in the disc , which leads to a lower accretion rate and the time scale for the depletion of the gaseous disc is essential in determining the architecture of the planetary system . as a result",
    ", we note that a low disc mass combined with a faster depletion of the gaseous disc leads to low mass planet systems . on the other hand a high disc mass combined with a slow depletion of the gas leads to solar and hot and warm jupiter systems .    when @xmath87 and @xmath36 ( second and third row , respectively ) , the solid surface density profiles are steeper , as a result solids accumulate in the inner disc , promoting the rapid formation and migration of giant planets .",
    "therefore , in this case of rapid formation , the gas dissipation timescale is not a relevant parameter in defining the architecture of the planetary system .",
    "these results are in agreement with those previously found by @xcite which performed numerical simulations with a self consistent code with the aim of addressing how the properties of a mature planetary system map to those of its birth disk . to this end , they performed simulations covering a range of disc parameters and generated 100 planetary systems .",
    "regarding the relevance of gaseous disc disipation time scale , they found similar results as we did , but with a more detailed code .",
    "the ensemble of more than 300 planetary systems discovered orbiting single stars , displays a wide range of architectures that show the planetary systems diversity .",
    "this diversity is related with the environment where the planets were formed and evolve .    in order to study this diversity of extrasolar planetary systems , in the present work we have developed a semi - analytical code for computing planetary systems formation which is based on the core instability model for the gas accretion of the embryos and the oligarchic growth regime for the accretion of the solid cores .    as our model is based on the core instability model ,",
    "the mass distribution in the protoplanetary disc is important , since it defines the number and location of the final giant planets that would define the architecture of the planetary systems .",
    "following protoplanetary discs observations , we explore different models for the initial protoplanetary nebula structure .",
    "based on the similarity solutions for a viscous accretion disc , we assume that the gas and solid surface density are characterized by a power - law in the inner part of the disc , with an exponent @xmath15 which take the values @xmath35 , @xmath87 and @xmath36 , and an exponential decay in the outer part .    in our model",
    "we also assume that the embryos have an orbital evolution due to their interaction with the gaseous disc which leads to type i and ii planetary migration .",
    "type i is very fast and a factor for delaying this migration rate is assumed , in order to represent the effects that could slow down or even stop it .",
    "we assume that the migration rate is delayed 100 and 10 times and also analyze the cases where it is not delayed and in some simulations the migration is not considered .    with this model",
    "we perform 12 simulations , in each one we explore the 3 different gas and solids disc density profiles considered and also the different planetary migration rates . in each simulation 1000 planetary systems are formed , whose initial conditions ( mass and size of the disc , metallicity , mass of the central star and time - scale of gaseous disc dissipation ) are taken randomly from distributions generated according to recent observational data .",
    "we analyze this artificial sample statistically , comparing with the observed planetary systems .",
    "we also present a new classification of planetary systems based on the location of giant planets and characterize each class exploring how they reflect the disc where they were born , analyzing the importance of key factors as disc size and mass , stellar metellicity , gas depletion time - scale and planetary migration rate .",
    "we show the main characteristics of each class and the number of giant planets that we expect to find in those systems which harbor giant planets , and the final number of small planets expected per low mass planet systems .",
    "finally we analyze which are the best environment for the formation of small , potentially habitable planets and in which class of planetary system they are expected to be found .",
    "one of the striking results , is that in all cases analyzed it is always the planetary systems with small planets which are the vast majority , being the only planetary systems formed when considering low metallicity discs ( when comparing with the solar metallicity ) .",
    "low mass planet systems are also the preferred planetary systems formed when a low mass disc is combined with a faster depletion of the gaseous disc , result also found by @xcite .",
    "the final number of embryos per planetary system is strongly dependent on the initial disc profile and migration rate assumed .",
    "planetary systems analogous to our solar system are preferentially formed in massive discs , in a high metallicity environment and where the disc profile that defines the gas and solid density in the inner disc is small .",
    "in addition , it also requires that the migration rate is not too fast , in order to avoid that the planets are pushed toward the inner edge of the disc .",
    "we found solar systems with more than one giant planet , even with three , but in no case with more than three giant planets .    assuming the sharpest disc profile , characterized by the largest value of @xmath15 assumed in this work , implies that the solids are accumulated in the inner regions of the disc , while they fall rapidly beyond the characteristic radius of the disc .",
    "this accumulation in the inner disc , favors the formation of hot - jupiter planets , which are preferably formed in very massive discs combined with a slow depletion of the gas and a metal rich environment .",
    "also a fast migration rate is required in order to form these systems . according to our results , most of the hot and warm jupiter systems",
    "are composed by only one giant planet , which is also a tendency of the current observational data .",
    "we also analyze which are the most favorable environments for the formation of low mass , potentially habitable planets and found that they are preferably formed in planetary systems analogs to our solar system and also in low mass planet systems , which are the best environments for the developing of these systems .",
