    "as a simplest example to study this mechanism , we consider the case with * @xmath33*. in this case , the rate equation in the continuum limit has a stable fixed point @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath7 is large , each @xmath35 fluctuates around this fixed point .",
    "the average concentration @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : average11a ] . with the decrease of @xmath7 , the difference between the pair @xmath36 and @xmath37 and the pair @xmath38 and @xmath39 is amplified , and there is clear deviation from the continuum limit case .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this amplification can be understood as follows .",
    "as @xmath7 is decreased , we have found that the 1 - 3 rich state , with extinction of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , appears when the increase of @xmath36 and @xmath37 occurs . to realize @xmath11 , it is necessary for the inflow interval of @xmath24 or @xmath42 to be longer than the time scale of the reaction .",
    "the inflow interval of @xmath3 molecules is @xmath29 , while the time scale for the reaction is @xmath30 .",
    "since we set @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the 1 - 3 rich state appears for @xmath45 , while the 2 - 4 rich state appears for @xmath46 .",
    "thus in the present case , the 1 - 3 rich state is first observed as @xmath7 is decreased . in the range of values of @xmath7",
    "for which the relations @xmath47 are satisfied , the 1 - 3 rich state is realized often , while the 2 - 4 rich state is not ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dist - a1 ] ) .",
    "once the 1 - 3 rich state is realized , an @xmath24 molecule and an @xmath42 molecule must enter the system almost simultaneously for the system to break out of this state .",
    "thus the ` rate of interruption ' of the 1 - 3 rich state is roughly proportional to @xmath48 , the product of the rates of @xmath24 inflow and @xmath42 inflow .",
    "the expected residence time in the 1 - 3 rich state is the reciprocal of the rate of interruption .",
    "thus the ratio of the expected residence times in the 1 - 3 rich and 2 - 4 rich states is @xmath49 .    from the above considerations , we expect that for some @xmath50",
    ", there appears a transition to the 1 - 3 rich state , leading to a drastic increase of the 1 - 3 concentration .",
    "the validity of this conclusion has been confirmed by several simulations , one of whose results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : average11a ] .",
    "the transition discussed above can create a stronger effect on the concentrations . as an example , consider the case * @xmath52*. in this case , as in case i , the 1 - 3 rich state is stable . while in this state , the system switches from a condition of @xmath53 to one of @xmath54 due to @xmath24 inflow and from @xmath54 to @xmath53 due to @xmath42 inflow .",
    "since the latter event is less frequent for @xmath55 , the condition @xmath54 is satisfied for a greater amount of time in the 1 - 3 rich state .",
    "hence , it is expected that @xmath56 .",
    "this is confirmed by the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : average11b ] .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the result in the continuum limit , where @xmath57 if @xmath58 ( i.e. , the time scale of the reactions is much shorter than that of the inflow ) .",
    "the significant difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 found here appears only when the 1 - 3 rich state is realized through the effect of the discreteness of the flow of @xmath42 molecules . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : average11b ] , there is amplification of the difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath7 decreases that occurs simultaneously with the transition to the 1 - 3 rich state .",
    "when @xmath59 is small enough to insure the existence of both 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states , the preference of states can depend on the concentrations @xmath6 .",
    "the preferred state is selected through another dit caused by outflow rather than inflow of a particular chemical .    as an example , we consider the case * @xmath60*. here again , the rate equation in the continuum limit has a stable fixed point . if @xmath58 , then @xmath61 and @xmath62 at the fixed point .    as discussed above ,",
    "1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states appear for small @xmath63 . in the 2 - 4 rich state , it is likely for @xmath41 to decrease as a result of the outflow of @xmath42 and the reaction @xmath64 facilitated by the inflow of @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath65 , it may be the case that all @xmath42 molecules flow out , and @xmath41 becomes @xmath9 .",
    "the time required to realize @xmath66 from @xmath67 should be @xmath68 when @xmath69 and @xmath70 . however , if @xmath71 is large , @xmath42 will be consumed by the reaction caused by @xmath23 , and for this reason , @xmath41 will decrease to @xmath9 more rapidly .",
    "the time required to use up @xmath42 may also depend on @xmath71 . in this case ,",
    "the 1 - 3 rich state is favoured by the mechanism described below .",
    "when @xmath72 , @xmath41 can increase again as a result of @xmath73 inflow , which leads to switch from the @xmath74 condition to the @xmath75 condition .",
    "the inflow interval for @xmath73 is @xmath76 .",
    "if this interval is much shorter than the time required for @xmath41 to reach @xmath9 , @xmath41 may increase again , causing the 2 - 4 rich state to be preserved .",
    "however , if the interval is longer , @xmath41 may decrease to @xmath9 , in which case , the 2 - 4 rich state can be readily destroyed by the inflow of an @xmath73 molecule , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts ] .",
    "when the system is in the 1 - 3 rich state , on the other hand , switches from a condition of @xmath53 to one of @xmath54 due to @xmath24 inflow , cause @xmath77 to remain large ( as in case i@xmath51 ) .",
    "the system therefore tends to maintain the condition @xmath54 ( as long as @xmath78 is not too large ) .",
    "however , @xmath79 only rarely decreases to @xmath9 , unlike @xmath41 , because @xmath71 is relatively large .",
    "thus the 1 - 3 rich state is more stable than the 2 - 4 rich state , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dist - c1 ] and [ fig : dist - c2 ] .    hence , when @xmath7 is decreased sufficiently to satisfy @xmath65 , and the time interval @xmath80 is sufficiently long to allow @xmath41 to decrease to @xmath9 , the 2 - 4 rich state loses stability , and the residence time in the 1 - 3 rich state increases , due to the discreteness of @xmath42 . as a consequence , @xmath37 increases as @xmath7 decreases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : average11c ] .",
    "summarizing the findings discussed above , differences among the ` degrees of discreteness ' of the chemicals lead to novel dit .",
    "the average chemical concentrations are greatly altered by this dit . indeed , as the system size ( the volume @xmath7 ) changes",
    ", there is a sharp transition to a state qualitatively different from that found in the continuum limit .",
    "there are two key parameters with regard to discreteness : one is @xmath81 ( investigated in case i ) , the inflow time interval for @xmath3 , and the other is @xmath82 ( investigated in case ii ) , the number of species @xmath3 molecules in the system when it is at equilibrium with the reservoir .",
    "if the interval @xmath81 is longer than the time scale of the reaction , @xmath83 , the discreteness of the @xmath3 inflow is relevant .",
    "in such a situation , the @xmath3 molecules present in the system may be completely consumed by the reaction before any new @xmath3 molecules flow in , so that @xmath8 may reach @xmath9 .",
    "then , if the condition @xmath84 is satisfied in addition to the above stated condition , @xmath8 can become @xmath9 as a result of all @xmath3 molecules flowing out of the system . in this case , the relation between the time necessary to realize a switch that increases @xmath8 and the time necessary for @xmath8 to decay to @xmath9 is also important .    with the above two conditions satisfied for each species @xmath3 ,",
    "there appear several switches to different states as @xmath7 is changed . as an example , we considered the case in which @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . in this case , the average concentration @xmath27 exhibits three transitions as @xmath7 is decreased , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : average ] .    first , in the continuum limit , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are very small , as resulted from the fact that @xmath89 . around @xmath90 ,",
    "the discreteness of @xmath73 becomes significant , and the 2 - 4 rich state appears .",
    "then the reactions @xmath91 and @xmath92 take place only sporadically .",
    "contrastingly , the flow of @xmath23 molecules is fairly steady .",
    "thus , while the system is in the 2 - 4 rich state , @xmath74 is satisfied for most of the time , as shown in case i@xmath51 .",
    "figure [ fig : dist - x2 ] displays the distribution of @xmath93 .",
    "double peaks corresponding to the 2 - 4 rich state appear in this situation .",
    "in the 2 - 4 rich state with @xmath74 , @xmath24 molecules flowing into the system raise @xmath40 to the level of @xmath94 , establishing equilibrium with the reservoir . at the same time",
    ", @xmath42 molecules flow out , and @xmath41 decreases to the level of @xmath95 , as seen in case ii .    as seen in case ii , the difference between @xmath40 and @xmath41 increases with further decrease of @xmath7 , since the switching rate decreases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist - x2 ] , the gap between the two peaks in the distribution of @xmath24 is seen to become larger as @xmath7 decreases .",
    "around @xmath96 , finally , the imbalance between @xmath40 and @xmath41 destabilizes the 2 - 4 rich state . for this reason ,",
    "the 1 - 3 rich state becomes almost as stable as ( or more stable than ) the 2 - 4 rich state , in spite of the relation @xmath89 .",
    "the residence time in the 1 - 3 rich state increases sharply , causing @xmath37 to increase ( as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ts ] and [ fig : average ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath37 increases to approximately @xmath97 , which is _ more than 30 times larger _ than its value in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "for very small @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath98 ) , @xmath79 and @xmath77 decrease to @xmath9 quite readily , and thus the 1 - 3 rich state is also easily destroyed . in this situation , for most of the time only one chemical exists in the container . here",
    ", only @xmath38 has a large value , with all of the others near or at @xmath99 .    in the manner described above , non - trivial alteration of chemical concentrations as a result of dit was observed .",
    "it has been found that those molecule species whose numbers vanish are determined not only by the flow rates but also by the network and dynamics of the reactions .",
    "for example , when @xmath7 is relatively large ( @xmath100 ) , @xmath37 decreases as @xmath101 increases .",
    "in conclusion , we have reported a dit that leads to a strong effect on the average concentrations of the chemicals .",
    "although we have studied a simple case with only four chemicals here , we have found that this type of dit appears in more complex reaction networks of a more general nature .",
    "in fact , we have randomly chosen a catalytic reaction network consisting of few hundred species , and studied the population dynamics of each chemical species with the scheme of stochastic simulation adopted here . for some reaction networks",
    "we have observed the dit as the volume is decreased . in such cases",
    ", we have found that the combination of the two mechanisms we studied here leads to a variety of transitions and alterations of molecular concentrations .",
    "although the example reported in the present paper is quite simple and may look special , the mechanism found in the example gives a basis for dit in complex reaction network .    generally speaking , dit and its effects on molecular concentrations are likely to be observed with chemical networks containing autocatalytic reactions .",
    "however , in some examples they are observed even without autocatalytic reactions .",
    "when some part of reaction networks works as an autocatalytic sub - network as a set , as seen in hypercycles @xcite , the dit of the present mechanism is possible .",
    "it is now experimentally feasible to construct a catalytic reaction system in a micro - reactor , and to design other types of systems with small numbers of molecules .",
    "also , there was great advance in techniques for detection of small numbers ( on the order of @xmath102 to @xmath103 ) of molecules using fluorescence or other new methods such as thermal - lens microscopy @xcite .",
    "in such systems , experimental verification of dit should be possible .",
    "also , we believe that the alterations of chemical concentrations resulting from dit that we found will have practical applications , since quite high accumulation of dilute chemical species is possible as we have shown here .    since the number of molecules in a biological cell is often small , the relevance of dit to cell biology is obvious .",
    "for example , in cell transduction , the number of signal molecules is often less than 100 , and even a single molecule can switch the biochemical state of a cell @xcite . in our visual system , a single photon in retina is amplified to a macroscopic level @xcite .",
    "transmission of signals through neurons via synapses also often involves a small number of molecules @xcite .",
    "chemical reaction network consisting of several autocatalytic reaction is widely seen in a cell , and such autocatalytic process provides a candidate for amplification of an effect of a single molecule .",
    "since the dit we reported here is generally observed in autocatalytic reaction networks , it is expected that it may be used in a biochemical reaction network in a cell .",
    "indeed , according to our results , the non - trivial accumulation of dilute molecules and switching among several distinct states with different chemical compositions may be realizable by , for example , the control of flow by receptor . additionally , in some preliminary simulations with large reaction networks , some sub - networks can be effectively activated or inactivated by dit . in such cases ,",
    "transitions between several states characterized by active sub - networks can be observed , which will be relevant to switching between cellular states by a few signal molecules .",
    "switching the expression of genes on and off is a focus of interest in bioinformatics .",
    "this digital behavior is also connected with the concentration of proteins present . as is pointed out @xcite , genetic regulation is under stochasticity coming from smallness in the number of associated molecules . as we have seen in our model",
    ", one chemical species can exhibit both an on / off switch and continuous regulation of other chemicals , even if the number of molecules of this species is small .",
    "we believe that the switching of chemical states facilitated by our dit plays a role in the regulation of genetic and metabolic processes in cells .    throughout the paper we have adopted stochastic particle simulations .",
    "of course master equation approach is also equivalently possible , which is especially useful if some analytic tools for it are developed .",
    "for example , use of fokker - planck equations derived in the limit of large volume ( molecule numbers ) , is a powerful tool @xcite . since our dit occurs when the volume ( the number of molecules ) is quite small , such tools are so far not available . in future",
    "it will also be important to develop some analytic tools for a system where the discreteness in the number is essential .",
    "this research was supported by grants - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology of japan ( 11ce2006 ) .",
    "we assumed that the chemicals are well stirred in the container and the molecules have no volume .",
    "thus the rate of the reaction @xmath1 is given by @xmath104 [ concentration / time ] , where @xmath18 is the reaction constant and @xmath35 is the concentration of the chemical @xmath3 . by rewriting it with the use of @xmath8 , the number of @xmath3 molecules , the rate of the reaction is given by @xmath105 [ reactions / time ] . in the same way , the rate of the @xmath3 inflow is given by @xmath4 [ molecules / time ] , corresponding to @xmath106 [ concentration / time ] , whereas that of the @xmath3 outflow is given by @xmath107 [ molecules / time ] , corresponding to @xmath108 [ concentration / time ] .",
    "we also assumed that the area of the surface of the container is proportional to the volume @xmath7 , and thus the rate of the @xmath3 flow is proportional to @xmath111 , to have this well - defined continuum limit for @xmath110 .",
    "one might assume that the area of the surface should be @xmath112 , and the rate of the @xmath3 flow should be proportional to @xmath113 . this change of setting alters just the parameter values . by suitably adjusting parameters @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 , the same transitions to the switching states and the alteration of average concentrations",
    "are observed , even with such settings .    with the rates of the reactions and the flows above",
    ", we carried out the stochastic simulation . in principle",
    ", one can carry out the simulation , by randomly selecting two molecules , and transforming one of them to other molecule , according to the reaction rule , with the probability proportional to the rate of reaction , when these molecules react . here , as an efficient simulation method , we adopt gillespie s direct method , instead .      in our system ,",
    "the state of the system is determined by @xmath8 , the number of molecules , and is changed only when one reaction or one molecular flow occurs .",
    "thus the rate of the reactions and the flows do not change until the next event ( one reaction or one molecular flow ) occurs , so that the lapse time to the next event decays exponentially .",
    "gillespie s direct method @xcite stands on this fact .",
    "first , we determine the lapse time to the next event by exponentially - distributed random numbers , and set the time forward .",
    "next , we determine which event occurs , with the proportion to the rate of the event .",
    "we change the state according to the event , and re - calculate the rate of the reactions and the flows .",
    "these steps are executed repeatedly , until the specified time elapses .    in some cases , especially with complicated reaction networks ,",
    "there are more efficient methods ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here , for simplicity , we adopted the gillespie s direct method .",
    "our result discussed above does not depend on which method to use .",
    "the choice of this method is only for efficiency .",
    "the numerical result by the method agrees with that of the direct simulation , as long as the time resolution and the resolution of the random number generator is sufficient .    the amplification rate , i.e. the ratio of the maximum @xmath114 , to @xmath37 at the continuum limit , depends on the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath6 .",
    "at the continuum limit , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , if @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath7 is moderately small and the 1 - 3 rich states are more stable than the 2 - 4 rich states , @xmath117 holds , as described already . in this case , @xmath118 because @xmath119 .",
    "thus the maximum value of @xmath37 is around ( or more than ) half of the total concentration @xmath120 ( @xmath121 , if @xmath58 ) .",

    "<S> the peak position of the distribution is changed with a finite jump , as the volume is decreased ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dist - x3 ] , while see later sections for the description of the model and simulation ) . </S>",
    "<S> borrowing the term of thermodynamics , the dit reported previously is regarded as a _ </S>",
    "<S> second order _ transition involving symmetry breaking , while the dit reported here corresponds to the _ first order _ transition without symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> this result is biologically significant as providing a possible description of the alteration of the concentrations of some molecules within cells . </S>",
    "<S> note in a cell , the number of molecules of each chemical species is not necessarily huge , and the discreteness effect is not always negligible .    to investigate this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we again use an autocatalytic reaction loop of chemicals , but here we consider the case in which @xmath5 , @xmath18 or @xmath6 is dependent on the chemical species @xmath19 , where @xmath18 is the reaction constant of the reaction @xmath1 . to study the effects of discreteness , we investigated the reaction model by using a stochastic particle simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed that the chemicals are well stirred in the container . at each simulation step , </S>",
    "<S> two molecules in the container are randomly chosen </S>",
    "<S> . then we judge if the molecules react or not , by checking if one of the two acts as a catalyst for the other as a substrate . to carry out the simulation efficiently here , we adopted gillespie s direct method @xcite ( see appendix ) @xcite .    note that for there to be a dit to a 1 - 3 or 2 - 4 rich state </S>",
    "<S> , it is necessary that the time interval for inflow of molecules be longer than the time scale of the reactions . </S>",
    "<S> this time interval for @xmath3 inflow should be @xmath20 . in our previous study , in which we considered the case of identical parameter values for all @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> , the discreteness of the molecular concentration has the same effect for all the molecule species , and the transition occurs near @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realize that the relevance of the discreteness of the molecular concentration depends on the reaction and flow rates of each molecule when the parameter values are not identical . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if @xmath22 , the inflow time interval for @xmath23 molecules is longer than that for @xmath24 molecules , so that the discreteness of the @xmath23 flow has a greater effect on the behavior of the system . in general , @xmath7 may determine the species that become extinct , and the average concentration of each molecule can be greatly changed by the discreteness effect .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the case in which @xmath6 is species dependent , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are identical for all species , for the autocatalytic loop introduced above . with this choice , the discreteness effect of each chemical @xmath3 depends on @xmath19 . in this system </S>",
    "<S> , we find discreteness effects that result in changes of the average concentrations @xmath27 , with the temporal average of the concentration @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> although this result is obtained with this simple example , the mechanism we find would appear to be quite general , and hence there is reason to believe that the dit we find exists in a wide variety of real systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the effect of the discreteness of the inflow of chemicals and how this depends on the relation between the reaction rate and the inflow rate . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the inflow interval of @xmath3 is @xmath29 , and the time scale of the reaction is @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> when the former time scale is larger than the latter , the reaction from @xmath19 to @xmath31 can proceed to completion before the inflow of species @xmath19 occurs . then @xmath8 becomes @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> as long as @xmath32 , no reaction to produce chemical @xmath3 occurs , and the average density may be decreased radically from the continuum limit case . </S>"
