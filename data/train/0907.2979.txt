    "study of ce - intermetallics have drawn significant attention during past few decades due to the observation of many unusual properties such as valence fluctuations , kondo screening , heavy fermion superconductivity in these systems .",
    "such properties arise due to the proximity of ce 4@xmath3 level to the fermi level leading to strong hybridization between the ce 4@xmath3 states and the conduction electronic states.@xcite a lot of success has been achieved to describe these systems within the anderson impurity models . here , the parameters defining the hybridization between 4@xmath3 states and valence electronic states are often estimated using band structure calculations based on local density approximations ( lda).@xcite however , the scenario can be significantly different if these materials contain transition metals ; the @xmath0 electrons contribute to the conduction band and the finite correlation strength among them leads to non - applicability of the band structure results within lda .    here , we report the results of our investigations on the electronic structure of ce@xmath1cosi@xmath2 using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy and _ ab initio _ band structure calculations .",
    "ce@xmath1cosi@xmath2 crystallizes in a alb@xmath1 derived hexagonal structure ( space group @xmath5 ) and is a mixed valent ( kondo lattice ) compound.@xcite the electrical transport measurements revealed temperature dependence@xcite typical of a mixed valent system.@xcite no signature of magnetic ordering was observed in the magnetic susceptibility measurements down to 0.5 k.@xcite interestingly , gradual substitution of rh at co sites leads to plethora of interesting features due to increasing dominance of indirect exchange interaction.@xcite for example , @xmath6 = 0.6 composition in ce@xmath1rh@xmath7co@xmath8si@xmath2 exhibits quantum critical behavior .",
    "intermediate compositions having higher rh concentration exhibit signature of spin density wave ( sdw ) state.@xcite thus , the @xmath0 electronic states corresponding to the transition metals plays a key role in determining the electronic properties in this interesting class of compounds .",
    "therefore , ce@xmath1cosi@xmath2 could be one of the ideal ones where the correlation among the electronic states other than ce 4@xmath3 states is important .",
    "high energy resolution employed in our measurements enabled us to reveal kondo - resonance feature and the corresponding spin orbit satellite .",
    "the comparison of the experimental spectra and the calculated ones indicate that the correlation strength among co 3@xmath0 electrons is strong ( @xmath9 3 ev ) .",
    "the contribution of the co 3@xmath0 partial density of states ( pdos ) is small in the vicinity of the fermi level , where ce 4@xmath3 contributions are dominant .",
    "ce@xmath1cosi@xmath2 was prepared by melting together stoichiometric amounts of high purity ( @xmath10 99.9% ) ce , co and si in an arc furnace .",
    "the single phase was confirmed by the absence of impurity peaks in the @xmath6-ray diffraction pattern .",
    "the specimen was further characterized by scanning electron microscopic measurements and energy dispersive @xmath6-ray analysis.@xcite the photoemission measurements were performed using a gammadata scienta ses2002 analyzer and monochromatic laboratory photon sources .",
    "the energy resolutions were set to 0.4 ev , 5 mev and 5 mev at al @xmath11 ( 1486.6 ev ) , he ii@xmath12 ( 40.8 ev ) and he i@xmath12 ( 21.2 ev ) photon energies , respectively .",
    "the base pressure in the vacuum chamber was 3 @xmath13 10@xmath14 torr .",
    "the temperatures variation down to 20 k was achieved by an open cycle he cryostat ( lt-3 m , advanced research systems , usa ) .",
    "the sample surface was cleaned by _ in situ _ scraping using a diamond file and the surface cleanliness was ensured by the absence of o 1@xmath15 and c 1@xmath15 features in the @xmath6-ray photoelectron ( xp ) spectra and the absence of impurity features in the binding energy range of 5 - 6 ev in the ultraviolet photoelectron ( up ) spectra .",
    "the reproducibility of the spectra was confirmed after each trial of cleaning process .",
    "the electronic band structure of ce@xmath1cosi@xmath2 was calculated using _ state - of - the - art _ full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method using wien2k software@xcite within the local density approximations , lda .",
    "the convergence for different calculations were achieved considering 512 @xmath16 points within the first brillouin zone .",
    "the error bar for the energy convergence was set to @xmath17  0.2  mev per formula unit ( fu ) . in every case , the charge convergence was achieved to be less than 10@xmath18 electronic charge .",
    "the lattice constants used in these calculations are determined from the @xmath6-ray diffraction patterns considering alb@xmath1 derived hexagonal structure and are found to be @xmath19  =  8.104    and @xmath20 =  4.197  .@xcite the muffin - tin radii ( @xmath21 ) for ce , co and si were set to 2.5 a.u . , 2.28 a.u . and 2.02 a.u .",

    "( c ) the ce 4@xmath3 spectral function obtained by subtracting he i spectrum from the he ii spectrum . ]    the valence band in ce@xmath1cosi@xmath2 consists of ce 5@xmath0 , ce 4@xmath3 , co 3@xmath0 and si 3@xmath4 electronic states . since the transition probability of the photoelectrons in the photo - excitation process strongly depends on the excitation energies , a comparison of the photoemission spectra collected at different excitation energies would help to identify experimentally the character of various features constituting the valence band . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we show the valence band spectra collected at 20 k using al k@xmath12 photon energy and the he ii@xmath12 and he i@xmath12 spectra are shown in fig .",
    "each spectrum exhibits two distinct features , a and b at about 1 ev and 2.3 ev binding energies , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the relative intensity of these features does not change with such a large change in photon energies .",
    "this is unusual as the photoemission cross sections corresponding to ce 5@xmath0 , ce 4@xmath3 , co",
    "3@xmath0 and si 3@xmath4 electronic states have significantly different excitation energy dependence.@xcite    to verify the change in lineshape with better clarity , we have broadened the he ii spectrum by convoluting a gaussian of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) = 0.4 ev to make the resolution broadening comparable to that of the xp spectrum . the broadened spectrum is shown by solid line superimposed over the xp spectrum in fig .",
    "the lineshapes of both the spectra are almost identical . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the he i and he ii spectra are superimposed over each other to investigate the change in lineshape when the energy resolution broadening is the same ( @xmath9  5  mev ) .",
    "the spectra in the binding energy range beyond 1 ev are found to be almost identical .",
    "all these observations suggest that the binding energy range @xmath10 1 ev of the valence band is dominantly contributed by one kind of electronic states .    the intensity close to the fermi level , @xmath22 , exhibit significantly different behavior as a function of excitation energy ( see fig .",
    "he ii spectrum exhibits large intensity and two distinct features c and k near @xmath22 , which are not visible in the other spectra .",
    "the high energy resolution employed in the he i and he ii measurements helped to resolve distinct signature of the features in the vicinity of @xmath22 .",
    "the photoemission cross section for ce 4@xmath3 states at he ii excitation energy is about 3 times larger than that at he i photon energy while it is almost the same for si 3@xmath4 states and double for co 3@xmath0 states.@xcite thus , the features c and k can be attributed to the photoemission signal primarily from the ce 4@xmath3 states .",
    "we have subtracted the he i spectrum from the he ii spectrum to delineate the ce 4@xmath3 contributions . the subtracted spectrum representing ce 4@xmath3 band is shown in fig .",
    "the distinct features , c and k corresponding to the spin orbit satellite of the abrikosov - suhl resonance ( asr ) and the main peak of asr , respectively , could clearly be identified.@xcite     partial density of states ( pdos ) , ( b ) ce 4@xmath3 pdos , ( c ) co 3@xmath0 pdos and ( d ) si 3@xmath4 pdos .",
    "the thick solid line in ( b ) represents the ce 4@xmath3 pdos rescaled by 25 times to show the weak intensities at lower energies . ]    in order to verify the character of the features theoretically , we have calculated the electronic band structure using flapw method .",
    "the calculated partial density of states ( pdos ) are shown in fig .",
    "the dominant contribution in this energy range arises from the ce 5@xmath0 , ce 4@xmath3 , co 3@xmath0 and si 3@xmath4 pdos as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , 2(b ) , 2(c ) and 2(d ) respectively . all the other contributions are negligible in this energy range .",
    "evidently , ce 5@xmath0 contributions are small and almost equally distributed over the whole energy range shown .",
    "ce 4@xmath3 band is intense and narrow as expected . in order to provide clarity ,",
    "we have rescaled the ce 4@xmath3 partial density of states ( pdos ) by 25 times and shown by thick solid line in fig .",
    "clearly , the 4@xmath3 pdos contribute essentially in the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath17 1 ev binding energy ) .",
    "the intensity of ce 4@xmath3 band is significantly weak at higher binding energies .",
    "this is consistent with the observation in fig .",
    "co 3@xmath0 states also have finite contributions in this energy range due to the hybridization between co 3@xmath0 and ce 4@xmath3 states .",
    "co 3@xmath0 and si 3@xmath4 electronic states also exhibit significant hybridization effect and appears dominantly in the binding energy range larger than 0.5 ev .",
    "the bonding states contribute in the energy range higher than 2 ev binding energy , where the si 3@xmath4 pdos has large contributions .",
    "the antibonding features appear in the energy range 0.5 to 2 ev , where co 3@xmath0 contributions are dominant .",
    "this suggests that the feature b in fig .",
    "1 has dominant co 3@xmath0 character and the intensities corresponding to si 3@xmath4 photoemission contribute to feature a. the dominance of co 3@xmath0 contributions in this whole energy range shown presumably leads to unchanged spectral lineshape with the change in photon energy as observed in fig 1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "in order to compare the experimental spectrum with the calculated results , we have calculated the xp spectrum in the following way : the ce 5@xmath0 , ce 4@xmath3 , co 3@xmath0 and si 3@xmath4 pdos per formula unit were multiplied by the corresponding photoemission cross sections at al @xmath11 energy .",
    "the sum of all these contributions was convoluted by the fermi distribution function at 20 k and broadened by the lorentzian function to account for the photo - hole lifetime broadening .",
    "the resolution broadening is introduced via further broadening of the spectrum by a gaussian function of fwhm = 0.4 ev .",
    "the calculated spectrum is shown by dashed line in fig .",
    "1(a ) after normalizing by the total integrated area under the curve .",
    "the intensities near @xmath22 in the experimental spectrum appears to be captured reasonably well in the calculated spectra .    in the higher binding energy region ; the intensity around 1 ev is overestimated and that around 2.5 ev is underestimated .",
    "since this energy range contains dominant contribution from the co 3@xmath0 states , it naturally indicates that co 3@xmath0 pdos region is not well described and correlations among co 3@xmath0 electrons may be important in determining the electronic structure in this energy range . in order to verify this",
    ", we have calculated the electronic density of states considering finite electron correlation , @xmath23 , among co 3@xmath0 electrons .",

    "3 represent the spectral functions for different @xmath23 values which are superimposed on the experimental xp spectrum represented by open circles . in fig .",
    "3(a ) we show the calculated spectra without ce 4@xmath3 contributions and the ones including ce 4@xmath3 contributions are shown in fig .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the signature of the feature around 2.3 ev ( feature b ) becomes more and more prominent with the increase in @xmath23 .",
    "subsequently , the intensity of feature a reduces .",
    "thus , the feature b can be attributed to the photoemission signal from electron correlation induced co 3@xmath0 bands ( lower hubbard band ) in addition to the si 3@xmath4 contributions .",
    "it is clear that the calculated spectral functions corresponding to @xmath23 @xmath9 3 ev is closest to the experimental spectrum compared to all other cases . for higher values of @xmath23 ,",

    "the results corresponding to the whole energy range is shown in ( a ) and that near fermi level is shown in ( b ) . ]",
    "the comparison of fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) establishes that the intensities near @xmath22 essentially arise due to the photoemission from the occupied part of the ce 4@xmath3 band .",
    "co 3@xmath0 contributions are small in this energy range and the co 3@xmath0 correlation induced effects has negligible influence on the spectral intensity at @xmath22 .",
    "consideration of ce 4@xmath3 bands in the spectral function calculation leads to a better description of the spectral intensities at the fermi level . in order to investigate the role of correlation among ce 4@xmath3 electrons in the electronic structure",

    "the unoccupied part of the spectral function exhibits large redistribution .",

    "the signature of electron correlations can also be observed in the co 2@xmath4 core level spectra.@xcite in fig . 5",
    ", we show the co 2@xmath4 spectrum collected at 20 k using al @xmath11 radiation .",
    "the spectrum consists of two spin orbit split features co 2@xmath26 and co 2@xmath27 at 778 ev and 792.9 ev binding energies , respectively ( energy separation of about 14.9 ev ) .",
    "these binding energies are identical to those found in elemental co metals.@xcite this indicates that the valence state of co is very similar to the elemental co metals .",
    "in addition , every spin orbit split feature exhibits a weak but distinct shoulder at higher binding energies .",
    "this has been shown more clearly by rescaling and shifting this energy region in the same figure .",
    "the energy separation between the main peak and the satellite is about 4 ev .",
    "finite intensity of the satellite feature again establishes the presence of electronic correlations among co 3@xmath0 electrons.@xcite thus , our results establish that the electron correlation strength among co 3@xmath0 electrons are significant and needs consideration to describe the electronic structure of these systems .",
    "in summary , we have studied the electronic structure of ce@xmath1cosi@xmath2 using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy and _ ab initio _ band structure calculations .",
    "the experimental results indicate the dominance of co 3@xmath0 contributions in the valence band .",
    "si 3@xmath4 states appear at higher binding energies ( 2 - 3 ev ) .",
    "the ce 4@xmath3 contributions appear essentially in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "high resolution employed in this study helped to probe the kondo resonance feature appearing at the fermi level .",
    "although the contribution of the co 3@xmath0 states at @xmath22 is weak , co 3@xmath0 states are found to be hybridized with the ce 4@xmath3 states .",
    "the comparison of the experimental results with the calculated ones indicate that co 3@xmath0 electrons are strongly correlated .",
    "these results thus , establish that in addition to the electron correlations among ce 4@xmath3 electrons , correlation among @xmath0 electrons needs to be considered to derive the electronic properties of these systems .",
