    "the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics assumes the existence of a classical domain outside the observed quantum system .",
    "the necessity of a classical domain comes , according with von neumann s approach , from the way it solves the measurement problem ( @xcite ) : in order to explain why a unique eigenvalue of some observable is measured out of all possible outcomes , it is postulated that the wave function suffers a real collapse , a process that can not be described by the unitary schrdinger evolution but must occur outside the quantum world , in a classical domain . in a quantum theory of the whole universe",
    ", there is no place for a classical domain .",
    "hence , the copenhagen interpretation can not be used in quantum cosmology .",
    "however , there are some alternative solutions to this quantum cosmological dilemma .",
    "one can say that the schrdinger evolution is an approximation of a more fundamental non - linear theory which can accomplish the collapse of the wave function @xcite , or that the collapse is effective but not real , in the sense that the branches related to unmeasured eigenvalues of the observable which appear in the splitting of a wave function in an impulsive measurement disappear from the observer but do not disappear from existence . in this second category",
    "we can cite the many - worlds interpretation @xcite and the bohm - de broglie ( bdb ) interpretation @xcite@xcite@xcite . in the former , all the possibilities in the splitting",
    "are actually realized . in each branch",
    "there is an observer with the knowledge of the corresponding eigenvalue of this branch , but she or he is not aware of the other observers and the other possibilities because the branches do not interfere . in the latter , a point - particle in configuration space describing the observed system and apparatus",
    "is supposed to exist , independently on any observations .",
    "it follows a trajectory in configuration space which is not the classical one due to the action of a quantum potential which arises naturally from the schrdinger equation . in the splitting of the wave function in a measurement ,",
    "this point particle will enter into one of the branches ( which one depends on the initial position of the point particle before the measurement , which is unknown ) , and the other branches will be empty .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the empty waves can neither interact with other particles , nor with the point particle containing the apparatus .",
    "hence , no observer can be aware of the other branches which are empty .",
    "again we have an effective but not real collapse ( the empty waves continue to exist ) , but now with no multiplication of observers .",
    "of course these interpretations can be used in quantum cosmology .",
    "schrdinger evolution is always valid , and there is no need of a classical domain outside the observed system .    the bdb interpretation has been sucessfully applied to quantum minisuperspace models @xcite and even to full superspace models @xcite @xcite . in the first case",
    "it was discussed the classical limit , the singularity problem , the cosmological constant problem , and the time issue .",
    "it was shown in scalar and radiation models for the matter content of the early universe that quantum effects driven by the quantum potential can inhibit the formation of a singularity by producing a repulsive quantum force that counteract the gravitational field , yielding inflation .",
    "the quantum universe usually reach the classical limit for large scale factors",
    ". however , it is possible to have small classical universes and large quantum ones : it depends on the state functional and on initial conditions @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the quantum evolution of homogeneous hypersurfaces form the same four - geometry independently on the choice of lapse function @xcite .",
    "for the case of a general superspace model ( i.e. the full theory ) a bdb picture of quantum geometrodynamics was constructed @xcite .",
    "as the bdb interpretation admits the notion of quantum trajectories ( in this case , the evolution of spacelike geometries in superspace , the space of all spacelike geometries ) , called bohmian trajectories , we were able to construct a hamiltonian formalism with constraints which generates such orbits .",
    "this hamiltonian formalism differs from the classical one only by the presence of the quantum potential in one of its terms which deviates the bohmian trajectory from the classical one . in this framework",
    ", it was possible to study the structures generated by the quantum evolution of spacelike 3-geometries using the theory of constrained hamiltonians developed by dirac @xcite for the case of geometrodynamics @xcite . in this way it was shown that , irrespective of any regularization and factor ordering of the wheeler - de witt equation , the bdb interpretation of quantum cosmology yields basically two possible scenarios : in the first one , the constraints which generates the quantum bohmian evolution of the geometry of the spacelike hypersurfaces obey an specific algebra , the dirac - teitelboim s algebra @xcite , which assures a consistent evolution that form a non degenerate 4-geometry with two possibilities : the usual hyperbolic classical spacetime and an euclidean spacetime where the change of signature from lorentzian to euclidean is driven by the quantum potential . in the second scenario ,",
    "the constraints are still conserved in time but they form an algebra different from the dirac - teitelboim s algebra yielding a consistent quantum evolution that form a degenerate 4-geometry .",
    "for example , in the case of real solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation , we have a structure satisfying the carrol group connected with the strong gravity limit .",
    "another example with a non - local quantum potential was also studied .    in that same paper",
    "@xcite we left open the possibility of an inconsistent evolution : a complicated non - local quantum potential would avoid the closure of the algebra , whatever it would be ( dirac - teitelboim or another alternative algebra ) , implying that the constraints are not conserved in time .",
    "as noted by dirac , it would imply an inconsistent hamiltonian evolution of the spacelike geometries .",
    "soon we realized that such possibility could also happen in quantum field theory .",
    "if this would be the case , then the subquantum reality of the bdb interpretation would be imposing selection rules on possible quantum states which are absent in other interpretations , either for quantum geometrodynamics as for quantum field theory .",
    "this could be used to find ways to distinguish experimentally between interpretations and/or impose new boundary conditions which could be used in quantum cosmology .",
    "in the case of quantum field theory , which is more accessible to experimental investigations , if one realize in nature quantum states which presents this patological bohmian behaviour , it would be a serious drawback of the bdb interpretation .",
    "on the contrary , if one finds impossible to realize such states in practice , this would be a strong point in favour of the bdb interpretation because it would give a reason for this impossibility which is not present in other interpretations .    in the present work",
    "we show that this is not the case : the algebra of the constraints is closed for any quantum potential when restricted to the quantum bohmian trajectories and hence there is no inconsistency in the sense of dirac , neither for quantum geometrodynamics , nor for quantum field theory .",
    "hence , the subquantum world of the bohm - de broglie interpretation is not imposing any restriction at all to the possible quantum states of a field theory : the admissible quantum states are the same as in any other interpretation .",
    "we begin the present paper with the application of the formalism developped in @xcite to a parametrized quantum field theory in flat background .",
    "we obtain analogous results as in quantum geometrodynamics , namely , the break of dirac - teitelboim s algebra and the consistency of the theory , in the sense of dirac , for any quantum potential . in this case , the break of dirac - teitelboim s algebra means a loss of lorentz invariance of individual events , a result already known in the literature @xcite@xcite but which is presented here in a different way . note",
    "that this break of lorentz invariance appears only at the level of individual quantum trajectories , the bohmian trajectories or the subquantum world , a notion which is absent in other interpretations of quantum mechanics .. an experiment in times shorter than this relaxation time might reveal this discrepancy , yielding in general results which are not lorentz invariant .",
    "in such situation , relativity would hold only as a statistical approximation valid for a distribution close to equilibrium in the stochastic process of the subquantum world that underly quantum mechanics . ]",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in the next section we revisit the parametrized scalar field theory in minkowski spacetime and we synthesize the teitelboim s result about the spacetime structure reflected in the constraint s algebra .",
    "in section iii we apply the bohm - de broglie interpretation to a parametrized scalar quantum field theory and we show that the bohmian evolution of the fields , irrespective to any regularization and factor ordering of the functional schrdinger equation , can be obtained from a specific hamiltonian which is , of course , different from the classical one . we prove that this hamiltonian formalism is consistent for any quantum potential .",
    "we then use this approach to rederive , in a concrete example , the well known loss of lorentz invariance of individual events in bdb theory in terms of the break of the dirac - teitelboim s algebra of the constraints .",
    "in section iv we consider quantum geometrodynamics in the bdb interpretation following the approach of our previous work , and we prove the consistency of the theory for any quantum potential , completing the possible scenarios for the bdb view of quantum cosmology presented in @xcite .",
    "section v is for discussion and conclussions .",
    "the appendix shows an alternative way to compute a relevant poisson bracket ( pb ) .",
    "an essential feature of geometrodynamics is the existence of the super - hamiltonian and super - momentum constraints which are present due to the invariance of general relativity ( gr ) under general coordinate transformations @xcite .",
    "we find an analogous situations in systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom and in field theory in flat spacetime when they are expresed as _",
    "parametrized _ theories ( see @xcite and @xcite cap vi ) . to parametrize a system with a finite number of degrees of freedom , with canonical coordinates @xmath0 depending on the physical time @xmath1 and with lagrangean @xmath2 , we simply promote @xmath3 as being one of the canonical coordinates @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) and depending on an arbitrary label time @xmath6 : @xmath7 . in defining the conjugate momenta @xmath8 of @xmath1",
    "a constraint appears : @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the hamiltonian in the old coordinates and @xmath11 is the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath12 ) .",

    "for the case of a relativistic field theory we have four parameters @xmath17 , instead of one @xmath1 .",
    "we will introduce them as canonical coordinates , together with the fields @xmath20 , by expressing them in terms of an arbitrary set of curvilinear coordinates @xmath21 as @xmath22 . in this manner ( see below ) , we can build the field theory with the states defined on a general spacelike hypersurface , which plays the role of time .",
    "we have a manifiest relativistic invariant hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the parametrized form of the action of a field in flat spacetime will help us in the implementation of the bdb interpretation to quantum gravity where the action is , from the beginning , parametrized .",
    "in fact , up to now , it is imposible to deparametrize gr in general by separating the dynamical ( i.e relevant ) degrees of freedom from the kinematical ( i.e. redundant ) ones . in gr",
    "we are forced to use redundant variables as canonical coordinates , and then constraints appears .",
    "specifying , let @xmath23 be a scalar field propagating in a @xmath24-dimensional flat spacetime with minkowskian coordinates @xmath25 .",
    "greek indices run from 0 to 3 and latin indices from 1 to 3 .",
    "let us consider curvilinear coordinates @xmath26 and a transformation @xmath27 for @xmath6 fixed , this equation defines a hypersurface with a spatial coordinate system @xmath28 defined on it .",
    "we will have a family of hypersurfaces for different values of the parameter ( label ) @xmath6 .",
    "the action in minkowskian coordinates is @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the lagrangean density in minkowskian coordinates . writing the action in curvilinear",

    "@xmath35 represents the lagrangean density in curvilinear coordinates .",

    "the lagrangean density is given by    @xmath47    we can define the ` kinematical ' momentum as @xmath48 which yields the constraint    @xmath49    i.e.    @xmath50    in such a way , it is posible to write the action linearly in the dynamical velocities @xmath51 and in the kinematical velocities @xmath46    @xmath52    in order to vary freely the action without worrying about the contraint ( [ vice ] ) , we must add the term @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are lagrange multipliers , yielding    @xmath55    it is possible to make a deeper analysis by projecting the constraints ( [ vice ] ) onto the normal direction and onto the paralell ( or tangential ) directions to the hypersurfaces @xmath56 :    @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath59 are the components of the tangent vectors in the basis @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the normal vector is defined by    @xmath62    @xmath63    ( @xmath64 for hyperbolic signature and @xmath65 for euclidean signature ) .",
    "hence , the general form of the constraints is given by the sum of a kinematical part plus a dynamical or field part :    @xmath66    @xmath67    the constraint @xmath68 is known as super - hamiltonian and the contraint @xmath69 as super - momentum .",
    "expanding @xmath54 in the basis @xmath70 , @xmath71 , we get the action in parametrized form :    @xmath72    the canonical variables @xmath73 are varied independently .",
    "the hamiltonian equations resulting from this variation will determine the evolution in time @xmath6 of the canonical variables .",
    "varying with respect to the lagrange multipliers @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath74 , we obtain the constraints :    @xmath75    we write the last equations in dirac s notation and terminology : the constraints are _ weakly _ zero , which means that the poisson brackets between a functional of the canonical variables @xmath76 and a weakly zero constraint are not necessarily zero @xcite . for consistency of the theory ,",
    "the constraints must be preserved in time , which means that their pb with the hamiltonian must be weakly zero .",
    "the hamiltonian is    @xmath77    and the constraints @xmath68 and @xmath78 will be conserved in time only if all the pb between them , evaluated on two points @xmath79 e @xmath80 of the hypersurface , are weakly zero .",
    "dirac made this computation ( with @xmath81 ) , and he showed that these brackets can be written as a linear combination of the original constraints ( i.e. new constraints do not arise ) satisfying the following algebra ( known as ` dirac - teitelboim s algebra')@xcite@xcite :    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    where upper indices of the supermomentum are raised by the metric tensor @xmath85 induced on the hypersurface @xmath56 , given by @xmath86 .",
    "( we take an usual convention in which we write the derivatives of the delta function with respect to the first argument every time : @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "dirac found this result with the constraints given in the form ( [ vice ] ) .",
    "it is appropiate at this point to remind a result that will be of fundamental importance to our approach , which was obtained by claudio teitelboim @xcite .",
    "he obtained this algebra ( but with the signature of spacetime appearing explicitily ) in a general form that is independent of the form of the constraints and without assuming a minkowski spacetime .",
    "he studied the deformations of spacelike hypersurfaces embedded in a riemannian spacetime .",
    "intuitively , a labeled hypersurface can be deformed in general according to two operations : leaving it fixed in the embedding spacetime and relabeling its points or keep fixed its labels and deform it into another hypersurface .",
    "the first operation represents a deformation @xmath89 tangential to the hypersurface , generated by some @xmath90 .",
    "the second operation represent a deformation @xmath91 ortogonal to the hypersurface , generated by some @xmath92 .",
    "( for the previous case we have @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "any functional @xmath95 of canonical variables ( fields and kinematical variables ) defined on the hypersurface will change , according to the hamiltonian given by @xmath96 in such a way that @xmath97 which we write as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "teitelboim follows a purely geometrical argument founded in the ` path independence ' of the dynamical evolution : the change in the canonical variables during the evolution from a given initial hypersurface to a given final hypersurface must be independent of the particular sequence of intermediary hypersurfaces along which the change is actually evaluated .",
    "then , assuming that the 3-geometries are embedded in a 4-dimensional non - degenerate manifold and consistency of the theory , he showed that the constraints @xmath101 and @xmath102 obey the following algebra ( ` dirac - teitelboim s algebra ' )    @xmath103\\ ] ]    @xmath104    @xmath105    where indices of supermomentum are raised with the metric @xmath85 induced on the hypersurface , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 is the metric of the embedding spacetime .",
    "the constant @xmath108 in eq.([algebra1 m ] ) can be @xmath109 depending if the 4-geometry where the hypersurfaces are embedded is euclidean ( @xmath110 ) or hyperbolic ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "this analysis can be applied to a field evolving in a prescribed riemannian background or when the embedding spacetime is generated by the evolution , as in gr . in the first situation ( and in a flat background ) the algebra imposes conditions for preserving the local lorentz invariance . in the case of gr",
    "the algebra provides the conditions for the existence of spacetime : the evolution of a 3-geometry can be viewed as the ` motion ' of a 3-dimensional cut in a 4-dimensional spacetime ( embeddability conditions ) .",
    "this result , when applied to the case of a parametrized field theory in a flat spacetime , means that the constraints obey the algebra given in ( [ algebra1c ] ) ( [ algebra2c ] ) ( [ algebra3c ] ) .      we will consider a scalar field in a flat spacetime , with a lagrangean given by    @xmath112    where @xmath113 . computing the energy - momentum tensor given by eq.([tensorme ] ) , and substituting it in ( [ vinculop0 ] ) and ( [ vinculopi ] )",

    "hence the dirac - teitelboim s algebra is not satisfied in this particular example . according to ref.@xcite",
    ", the bohmian trajectories are generating a new structure which does not correspond to a relativistic field propagating in minkowski spacetime .",
    "in other words , we have shown the breaking of lorentz invariance in terms of the breaking of the dirac - teitelboim s algebra of the constraints .",

    "the constraints are present due to the invariance of gr under spacetime coordinate transformations .",

    "the canonical momentum of the scalar field is now @xmath233 the quantity @xmath234 is the intrinsic curvature of the hypersurfaces and @xmath235 is the determinant of @xmath85 .",
    "the quantities @xmath236 and its inverse @xmath237 ( @xmath238 ) are given by @xmath239 @xmath240 which is called the dewitt metric .",

    "after quantizing this theory following the dirac procedure , we obtain the wheeler - dewitt equation and , in order to construct the bdb interpretation , the wave functional is written in polar form @xmath246 yielding two equations for @xmath138 and @xmath137 which of course depend on the factor ordering we choose .",
    "however , in any case , one of the equations will have the form    @xmath247    where @xmath227 is the classical potential given in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "contrary to the other terms in eq .",
    "( [ hj ] ) , which are already well defined because they do not need any regularization , only the precise form of @xmath198 depends on the regularization and factor ordering procedures which are prescribed for the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "( [ hj ] ) is like the hamilton - jacobi equation for gr , suplemented by an extra term @xmath198 , the quantum potential .",
    "the trajectories of the 3-metric and scalar field ( which in this interpretation always exist by assumption ) can be obtained from the guidance relations @xmath248 @xmath249 these are first order differential equations which can be integrated to yield the 3-metric and scalar field for all values of the @xmath6 parameter .",
    "these solutions depend on the initial values of the 3-metric and scalar field at some initial hypersurface",
    ". the evolution of these fields will of course be different from the classical one due to the presence of the quantum potential term @xmath198 in eq .",
    "( [ hj ] ) .",
    "what kind of structure do we obtain when we integrate this equations in the parameter @xmath6 ? does this structure form a 4-dimensional geometry with a scalar field for any choice of the lapse and shift functions ? note that if the functional @xmath137 were a solution of the classical hamilton - jacobi equation , which does not contain the quantum potential term , then the answer would be in the affirmative because we would be in the scope of gr .    in order to answer the questions formulated above , we moved from this hamilton - jacobi picture of quantum geometrodynamics to a hamiltonian picture , where strong results concerning geometrodynamics exist @xcite@xcite . in this way we have constructed a quantum geometrodynamical picture of the bohm - de broglie interpretation of canonical quantum gravity and we found that once the bohm s guidance relations , given by eqs .",

    "the quantum potential does not break the dirac - teitelboim s algebra , and the most important quantum effect is the change of signature yielding an euclidean spacetime .    * b*. a consistent but degenerate four - geometry indicating the presence of special vector fields and the breaking of the spacetime structure as a single entity .",
    "the constraints satisfy an algebra different from dirac - teitelboim s algebra .",
    "we left open the possibility of a third structure that would correspond to an inconsistent bohmian evolution in which the algebra of the constraints does not close i.e. one of the pb would not be zero ( the constraints would not be conserved in time ) .",
    "the relevant pb is @xmath252 ( the other two pb are weakly zero for any quantum potential as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . some complicated non - local quantum potential could make this pb weakly different from zero . in the present section",
    "we show that the pb @xmath252 , when restricted to the bohmian trajectories , is weakly zero for any quantum potential .",
    "hence there is no inconsitency : quantum geometrodynamics in the bohm - de broglie interpretation is always a consistent theory for any quantum state . in order to show this fact , we calculate    @xmath253    2    our steps are similar to the ones followed in the previous section .",
    "we write the quantum potential as follows from the modified hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ hj ] )    @xmath254    and replace it into ( [ pbqgd ] ) yielding    @xmath255    2    where @xmath256 means the same expression with @xmath79 and @xmath257 interchanged . in the rhs ,",
    "the terms proportionals to @xmath258 ( these terms come from the functional derivatives @xmath259 and @xmath260 ) were cancelled with the terms that come from the term @xmath261 .",
    "the four terms that follows after @xmath262 will produce exactly @xmath263 and they will be cancelled out . substituting the momenta expressed according bohm s guidance relations    @xmath264    @xmath265    it is easy to see , using the symmetry properties of @xmath236 , that all terms that are not weakly zero will be cancelled by pairs .",
    "at last we have    @xmath266    2    the rhs of this equation is weakly zero because of the bohm s guidance relations and , then    @xmath267    this prove the consistency .",
    "note that it was very important to use the guidance relations to close the algebra .",
    "it means that the hamiltonian evolution with the quantum potential ( [ hjerrata ] ) is consistent only when restricted to the bohmian trajectories . for other trajectories",
    ", it may be inconsitent .",
    "this is an important remark on the bdb interpretation of canonical quantum cosmology , which sometimes is not noticed .",
    "we would like to remark that all these results were obtained without assuming any particular factor ordering and regularization of the wheeler - dewitt equation . in the canonical approach that we follow ,",
    "the problems of renormalization and regularization appear in the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation because of the appearance of second order functional derivatives at the same point .",
    "some ways to attack this problem are described in @xcite @xcite , and in all of them the kinetic part of the hamilton - jacobi equation associated with the wdw equation is not affected . as we said above , only the quantum potential term",
    "is affected .",
    "as our results are independent of the explicit form of the quantum potential , our results are not affected by renormalization and values of coupling .",
    "we have studied a hamiltonian description of the bdb interpretation of quantum field theory and canonical quantum gravity .    in the first case ,",
    "we have examined certain state functionals where the quantum potential have such a form that the dirac - teitelboim s algebra of the classical constraints of the hamiltonian picture is broken , and the structure of the background spacetime becomes different from the minkowski one .",
    "this implies the break of lorentz invariance of individual events .",
    "we exhibited a concrete example given by the ground state of a free scalar field presenting this property .",
    "this is a well known result ( see @xcite @xcite ) , but we have shown it in terms of the break of dirac - teitelboim s algebra . in this manner , the bdb view of quantum field theory expressed in a hamiltonian approach can give a nice picture of the loss of lorentz invariance of the bohmian subquantum world : when dirac - teitelboim s algebra is broken , then lorentz invariance of individual events is lost .",
    "we should remember that the statistical properties of the quantum field , which are the same in the bdb interpretation as in the conventional one , continue to be lorentz invariant .",
    "we have shown that both quantum field theory and canonical quantum gravity have a consistent bohmian hamiltonian formulation , in the sense of dirac , for any quantum potential , i.e. , any state functional , when restricted to the bohmian trajectories . in the case of canonical quantum gravity , this complete the quantum geometrodynamical picture of quantum cosmology in the bdb view which was constructed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the importance of this result can be seen as follows : supose there were states which had inconsistent quantum evolution in the bdb interpretation , in the sense we have described .",
    "then , the subquantum reality of the bdb interpretation would be imposing selection rules on possible quantum states which are absent in other interpretations .",
    "this could be used to find ways to distinguish experimentally between interpretations and/or impose new boundary conditions which could be used in quantum cosmology .",
    "however , we have shown that this subquantum world is not imposing any restriction to the possible quantum states of a field theory : the admissible quantum states are the same as in any other interpretation .",
    "we would like to thank _ conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico _ ( cnpq ) of brazil and _ centro latinoamericano de fsica _ ( claf ) for financial support .",
    "we would also like to thank ` pequeno seminario ' of cbpf s cosmology group for useful discussions .",
    "we present here the computation of @xmath268 for the parametrized field theory .",
    "even though it is a well known result , we compute it in a new way .",
    "the superhamiltonian is given by ( eq . [ shc ] ) @xmath269 which we write , for simplicity , as            using the fact that @xmath273 , which comes from ( [ nu ] ) , and the basic properties of the @xmath274 , it is possible to show that each of the last two brackets of the rhs of this equation are identically zero .",
    "next , using the same argument and the fact that the potential @xmath275 does not contain derivatives of the metric , the last equation becomes :                            99 n. pinto - neto and e. sergio santini , phys.rev .",
