    "the fact that uv radiation and x - rays can alter the atmospheres of stars has been recognized for more than thirty years @xcite .",
    "irradiation by a source like an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) will produce an increase in the atmospheric temperature and in the mass loss rate @xcite .",
    "even a modest level of irradiation from a low - luminosity agn , like the one currently at the center of the milky way , can be sufficient to destroy molecules formed in the atmosphere of cool giant stars , thus transforming their spectrum without inducing significant mass loss .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out detailed computations of the atmospheric structure of an m dwarf irradiated by a hot stellar companion ( a pre - cataclysmic variable ) . however , up to now , and despite recent advances in the calculation of molecular opacities @xcite and in stellar modeling algorithms , no detailed computations of the atmosphere of a cool giant star that is irradiated by an external source have been performed .    in this paper , for the first time",
    ", we compute the stellar spectrum and atmospheric structure of a cool ( @xmath3 k ) giant ( both carbon and oxygen rich ) star in the presence of an agn .",
    "our stellar atmosphere code includes a complete frequency dependent description of the atomic and molecular lines that dominate the infrared ( ir ) spectrum .",
    "our computational approach is general , but we focus here on the spectrum of a star that is irradiated by a source at the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "we are motivated by the recent discovery @xcite that the gc may have been a low - luminosity agn ( @xmath4 erg s@xmath1 ) as recently as a couple of hundred years ago .",
    "in addition , recent estimates of the rate of stellar tidal disruptions by the gc supermassive black hole ( sbh ) @xcite suggest a rate of order one event per @xmath5 yr or higher for solar - mass stars .",
    "tidal disruption of a star by a sbh is expected to produce an extremely luminous event , @xmath6 erg s@xmath1 , with a duration of weeks or months ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the gc sbh was recently found to be surrounded by a cluster of apparently young stars .",
    "for one of these stars , s0 - 2 , an ir spectrum showed no co absorption , and possible hei ( @xmath7 @xmath8 m ) absorption @xcite .",
    "the latter indicates that the star can not have an effective temperature less than about @xmath9 k @xcite .",
    "the orbit of s0 - 2 has a pericenter distance of @xmath10 au and an apocenter distance of @xmath11 au .",
    "the presence of the hei line and the absence of co point to s0 - 2 being young , with spectral class in the domain o and b. the case for hot stars so close to the gc has been further reinforced by @xcite who obtained high s / n spectra of 17 s - cluster stars .",
    "for the brightest stars in this sample , spectra clearly show the presence of the hei line at @xmath12 m .",
    "however for stars with @xmath13 the line is not present .",
    "hence , the spectral properties of the s - cluster stars are not uniform .",
    "if these stars are actually young ( a few myr ) , their formation so close to gc sbh is a serious theoretical challenge @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that these stars are not young but old , and that their atmospheres have been modified by some physical mechanism : stellar collisions , tidal stripping or external radiation ( e.g. @xcite , see also the review by @xcite and references therein ) .    in this work ,",
    "we compute the detailed spectrum of giant stars irradiated by an agn in the luminosity range @xmath14 erg s@xmath1 integrated over the range @xmath15 kev ( hereafter we denote the luminosity in this range by @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , we show how these old giants are affected by low - luminosity agn ( @xmath17erg s@xmath1 ) like the one that may have been present at the gc in the recent past , and also by the high luminosity ( @xmath18 erg s@xmath1 ) that is believed to accompany the tidal disruption of a star by the sbh .",
    "we find that the spectrum of an irradiated old giant star is similar to that of the faintest s - cluster stars ( @xmath13 ) observed by @xcite . however , we are unable to transform the spectra of cool giants such that they resemble those of the brightest s - cluster stars for a low luminosity agn ( @xmath19 erg @xmath20 ) .",
    "higher luminosities though , as the one from a tidally disrupted star are sufficient to heat up the stellar atmosphere above @xmath9 k , and therefore produce the hei line",
    ". however , the total destruction of molecular lines in the spectra of these giants seems to point out that the deficiency of giants in the gc @xcite might not be such .",
    "we show that , within our model , irradiation explains the decreasing co band intensity observed as a function of radius from sgr a@xmath21 .",
    "the other main result of our study is that we find a double layer inversion in the atmospheres of irradiated giants for irradiation fluxes @xmath22 erg s@xmath1 @xmath23 on the surface of the star .",
    "we demonstrate that even if the agn was shining at or near the eddington luminosity for @xmath24 years , due to the high eccentricity of the s - cluster stars orbits , the amount of irradiation is most likely not sufficient to make the hei line appear .",
    "on the other hand , stars on more circular orbits could potentially be sufficiently transformed to reproduce the spectral properties of the brightest s - cluster stars ( including the hei line ) .",
    "if the atmosphere of the star is sufficiently irradiated , the energy deposited in the atmosphere will heat up the outer layers and produce a wind .",
    "@xcite constructed a semi - analytic model to account for the effects of irradiation on a stellar atmosphere .",
    "the most obvious consequence of irradiation is that the temperature of the area of the star facing the agn increases by @xmath25 . at the microscopic level the x - rays photo - ionize he i , he ii and o , c , ne , n , fe and its ions . below @xmath26",
    "k the main source of opacity is due to photo - detachment of @xmath27 , while above this temperature opacity is dominated by photo - ionization of oxygen and carbon .",
    "@xcite find that in their models the envelope develops a significant wind , although most of the energy is re - radiated . by integrating the hydrodynamic equations ,",
    "@xcite calculated the rate at which mass is lost from the envelope of red super - giants .",
    "we use their work to estimate the mass loss rate from giant atmospheres in  [ section : mass_loss ] .",
    "however , in order to compare with the observations of @xcite , we are interested in computing detailed spectra of irradiated stars . for this purpose",
    "we have used a stellar atmosphere code @xcite , which is based on the marcs code @xcite .",
    "the models are computed in hydrostatic equilibrium , with radiative and convective energy transport included .",
    "plane parallel and spherical geometry are considered where appropriate .",
    "the radiative transfer includes neutral and one time ionized atomic lines from the vald data base and molecular opacities from co , c2 , cn , cs , hcn , c2h2 , c3 , sio , tio , h2o , and several diatomic hydrates ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all opacities are treated by the opacity sampling technique @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric structure and the spectra are computed separately ( in order to allow studies of the contribution of various species to the spectra individually ) , but consistently and based on the same linelists .",
    "a new feature of the version of the code used for the present paper is the treatment of external illumination , which we have based on the inclusion of an improved version of the subroutines developed and described by @xcite .    for reference",
    ", we first compute the spectra of non - irradiated oxygen - rich ( c / o@xmath28 , t@xmath29 k , log g=2.0 , @xmath30 ) and carbon - rich ( c / o@xmath31 ) stars .",
    "we then consider an irradiated star .",
    "the irradiation source is taken to be the gc with an agn spectral shape as given by @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use their eq .",
    "14 for the energy range @xmath32 and their eq . 8 for @xmath33",
    "kev and 23 for @xmath34 ev . the total flux for sgr a@xmath35 , assuming a mass of @xmath36 m@xmath37 is @xmath38 erg s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "although the @xcite spectral energy distribution is for typical qso s we use it here as a good approximation to describe the agn at the gc .",
    "our results are not sensitive to moderate changes on the parameters that describe the spectral energy distribution of qso s in @xcite . for @xmath39",
    "the luminosity of the agn at the gc corresponds roughly to the estimate by @xcite for the luminosity of the gc a few hundred years ago .",
    "k. the upper panel shows the atomic lines , the second panel the co lines , the third panel other molecules while the bottom panel shows the total spectrum .",
    "note that the strong co bands start at about @xmath40 , usually beyond the range observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note also the presence in the total spectrum of molecular - band absorption lines but also of the br@xmath41 atomic line at @xmath42 . ]    the ir spectrum ( @xmath43 ) for the non - irradiated case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : o ] for the oxygen - rich model .",
    "the top panel shows the atomic lines , the second panel the co bands , the third panel other molecular bands and the bottom panel is the total spectrum .",

    "note that there are no emission lines .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that there are no co lines in the @xmath44 range ; they appear only at wavelengths beyond @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , these strong bands would not be observed in the spectra of @xcite or @xcite . while the molecular bands are somewhat stronger than those observed in the faintest s - cluster stars , the spectrum of a non - irradiated oxygen - rich giant is not too dissimilar from the ones observed for the faint stars in the s - cluster sample ( see fig .  1 in @xcite and fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",

    "but for a star with an illumination flux @xmath45 .",
    "note the extreme transformation of the spectrum with now only atomic lines in emission and no molecules , including co. ]     structure of the relevant model atmospheres : solid line is for @xmath46 , dashed line is for @xmath47 and dotted line is for @xmath48 .",
    "note the inversion temperature layer that takes places at illumination fluxes of @xmath49        we then irradiate the star as described above , assuming different incident fluxes .",

    "[ fig : cirr2 ] assumes a flux of @xmath53 , corresponding to a star illuminated by sg @xmath2 during a more active state when @xmath54 , still smaller than the luminosity estimated by @xcite for the luminosity of the gc a few hundred years ago .",
    "our illuminated atmospheric models are static and we are not able to compute models with larger illumination fluxes that @xmath55 . for this dynamic models",
    "are required , which we are currently constructing .",
    "however , even for @xmath55 the transformation of the spectrum is significant .    the first thing to note from fig .  [",
    "fig : cirr ] is the decrease in the strength of the molecular lines even for @xmath56 .",
    "note also the reduction of the co band intensity .",
    "if we examine the spectrum of the star for @xmath57 , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cirr2 ] ) , we notice even more significant changes .",
    "as expected , all the molecular bands are gone , including the co bands .",
    "however , now some of the atomic lines are in emission due to the stronger irradiation . in particular , the br@xmath41 line at 2.1661",
    "@xmath8 is now in emission . at this small distance , irradiation results in a rise in the temperature of the atmosphere at @xmath58 from @xmath59 k to @xmath60 k.",
    "however , the hei line at 2.11 @xmath8 is clearly not present , and more importantly , no other line in the irradiated star appears at the same wavelength .",
    "it is clear that s - cluster stars irradiated at their present orbits ( @xmath61 to @xmath62 pc ) by a low - luminosity agn a few hundred years ago do not resemble the spectra of any of the observed s - cluster stars seen today @xcite .",
    "their spectra would be totally dominated by emission lines . on the other hand , if we look at fig .",
    "[ fig : cirr ] , which is equivalent to a star irradiated at a distance of a few hundred au but with a luminosity of @xmath63 erg s@xmath1 the similarity with the faintest stars of the @xcite sample is striking . in this case",
    ", the hei line is absent and the deepest absorption feature in the spectrum is dominated by the br@xmath41 line .",
    "it is clear that after the level of irradiation suggested by @xcite has ceased , the star will cool down and readjust to its previous equilibrium situation in a few years ( as soon as the temperature is low enough , about @xmath64k , molecules will form immediately on a time scale of seconds ) .",
    "however , the presence of illumination will stop convection on the atmosphere .",
    "it takes of the order of a few hundred years for convection to be restored and therefore the temperature in the outer layers to decrease enough for molecules to be allow to reform .",
    "this argument also assures that the time - scale of molecule formation is longer than the rotation time - scale of the stars assuring that molecules will be wiped out over the whole surface of the star .",
    "note however that the present @xmath65-ray flux from the gc is sufficient to destroy molecules , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cirr ] .    figure 5 shows the temperature versus gas pressure model structure for a oxygen - rich giant for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the moderately irradiated model @xmath56 from the gc ( as well as in the non - irradiated model ) ,",
    "the upper layers are relatively dense ( @xmath68 100 dyn/@xmath69 ) .",
    "therefore the absorption of radiation from the sbh at the gc is substantial already in the top of the atmosphere . as a result",
    ", the model structure resembles a photospheric - chromospheric atmosphere with a slowly rising , almost flat , chromospheric temperature distribution .",
    "the inner part of the atmosphere is almost unaffected by the illumination at @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath70 the radiation is strong enough that the atmosphere is heated at all optical depths in the atmospheric model , and the chromospheric temperature rise is substantial . as a result , the degree of ionization increases , making the continuous opacity increase , whereby the atmosphere expands ( considerably ) .",
    "figure 6 shows the relative fraction of neutral ( ci ) and one time ionized ( cii ) carbon ( the two right panels ) for the three models in fig .",
    "5 . other atoms , including h , n , o , al , si , s , ca , and ni , behave qualitatively similarly ( whereas ca , mg , cr and fe are substantially double ionized in the top - layers , and he is neutral throughout the atmosphere ) .",
    "the main contributer of free electrons is hydrogen , and the total abundance and pressure of electrons are shown in the two left panels .",
    "it is seen that the degree of ionization ( and the abundance of free electrons ) increases rapidly outward from @xmath71 0 to @xmath722 .",
    "this is the region of temperature rise in the strongly irradiated model ( @xmath73 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 ) . from @xmath76 and outward hydrogen",
    "is fully ionized , and the electron density and pressure therefore now again decreases outward . as a consequence",
    "the opacity decreases in the outermost layers , and the energy deposition due to external illumination also decreases outwards from log @xmath77 onwards .",
    "the temperature therefore decreases toward the surface from this point onwards , just like in a normal photospheric model .",
    "this feature is not seen in any chromospheric model heated from below .",
    "it is particular to strongly irradiated atmospheres .",
    "in this section , we consider whether the heat input from agn irradiation is sufficient to evaporate the stellar envelope of a star , causing an observable change in its spectrum .",
    "we consider much larger agn luminosities than in the previous section , up to @xmath78 .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the very high luminosities believed to accompany stellar tidal disruptions @xcite , and the estimated high rate of such events @xcite , one per @xmath79 yr or so .",
    "this is a radiative rather than a gravitational ( e.g. , @xcite ) mechanism for stripping stellar envelopes off stars near the gc . if the effective temperature is only raised to about @xmath80 k ( which is high enough to produce the observed hei line ) , then these modified stars could explained the observed s - cluster stars , though stars with higher effective temperatures will have lifetimes which are too short to account for the number of stars observed ( see eq .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "note that stripping the envelope is a different mechanism than the one proposed in the previous sections of this work where the temperature of the stellar atmosphere was raised due to illumination without mass loss .",
    "it is this constant illumination that keeps the stellar atmosphere hot . in the stripping scenario",
    "there is no source of heating and the star will cool down to a new equilibrium configuration .",
    "regardless , it is still interesting to explore the consequences of the mass loss as it will be a useful marker of the past activity of sgr @xmath2 .",
    "this mechanism will clearly predict a characteristic dependence of the number of `` hot '' stars on pericentric radius . stripping the envelope off a star",
    "exposes its hotter core , and thus increases its effective temperature .",
    "however , the luminosity of the star will be unaffected , since the conditions in the stellar core are effectively decoupled from the conditions in the envelope . with numerical stellar models @xcite , we compute the effective temperature @xmath81 of the stripped star , and its new radius @xmath82 , assuming @xmath83=const .    can the entire envelope be stripped due to a close encounter with an agn ? @xcite consider the @xmath65-ray induced mass loss from stars near agn .",
    "they consider mass loss due to two mechanisms : thermal winds driven by x - ray heating , and stellar ablation by radiation pressure . for thermally driven winds",
    ", they directly integrate the hydrodynamic equations , and find that the formula : @xmath84 reproduces their results very well , as well as the previous analytic results of @xcite . here",
    "@xmath85 is the agn luminosity , @xmath86 is the distance of the star from the agn , and @xmath87 is the stellar radius .",
    "note that this calculation assumes that emission line cooling is quenched in the wind , and is therefore potentially an overestimate .",
    "they find that ablative mass loss ( which is independent of emission line cooling ) , is @xmath88 for @xmath89 , where @xmath90 we will approximate the suppression for @xmath91 via @xmath92 .",
    "since the orbital distance @xmath93 , the stellar mass @xmath94 and the stellar radius @xmath95 are all time - dependent , we find the total mass loss by integrating equations ( [ eqn : mdot_thermal ] ) or ( [ eqn : mdot_ablation ] ) numerically .",
    "for the agn luminosity assumed , @xmath96 for a @xmath97 sbh , the stellar envelope will be stripped from a star after @xmath98 of its main sequence lifetime , or @xmath99 years , if the star remains at @xmath10 a.u . from the sbh throughout this time .",
    "proper motion observations of gc stars have managed to pin down their orbital parameters : specifically , their eccentricity @xmath100 and pericenter distance @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the orbits are all highly eccentric ; typically @xmath101 , while pericenter distances are of order @xmath102 a.u . given these parameters",

    "this gives the relative reduction in flux compared to a circular orbit at pericenter distance.,width=321 ]    the mass loss can be a significant amount of the star s mass , but is still insufficient to boost the effective temperatures to sufficiently high values .",
    "this is because the orbits are highly eccentric , and spend most of their time at large radii , far from pericenter @xmath51 .",
    "we can compute the suppression factor compared to a purely circular orbit by considering the flux - weighted fraction of time an object spends close to pericenter in a single orbit : @xmath110 ( it is acceptable to average over a single orbit since the typical orbital period @xmath111 years is much less than the main sequence lifetime ; we are estimating the cumulative mass loss over many orbits ) .",

    "it has been argued in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) that the observed spectra of the s - cluster stars , are in agreement with standard spectra of type b8 or earlier , indicating that the stars are young , which is a puzzle because at such distances the tidal force by the central bh is far to great to be overcome by densities in normal molecular clouds .",
