    "the bright evolved star @xmath15  cephei ( @xmath16 , spt = k1  iii ",
    "iv , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , j2000 ; also known as hd  222404 , hr  8974 , hip  116727 ) is among the first objects to be subjected to high - precision radial - velocity measurements in an effort to discover substellar - mass companions around nearby stars @xcite .",
    "this group of investigators @xcite pioneered the use of a hydrogen fluoride gas absorption cell on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and achieved internal errors around 13  for bright stars , inaugurating the era of doppler searches that has been so successful in finding extrasolar planets in the last 10 years .",
    "small radial - velocity variations in  were indeed seen by @xcite suggesting the presence of a jupiter - mass object in a @xmath02.5-yr orbit . those variations with a semi - amplitude of only about 25  were superimposed on a much larger variation caused by a previously unnoticed stellar companion with a period of decades . however , the interpretation of the residual 2.5-yr variation as due to a planetary object was subsequently put in doubt by the same group ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they argued that changes with a similar period were observed in a chromospheric activity indicator in  ( the @xmath198662 emission line index ) , and thus that the velocity variations were spurious and probably due only to changes in the spectral line profiles caused by surface inhomogeneities ( spots ) driven by stellar rotation .",
    "more recently the planetary interpretation was reinstated by @xcite on the basis of new high - precision velocity observations at the mcdonald observatory .",
    "they showed convincingly that the 2.5-yr variation is coherent in phase and amplitude throughout the entire 20-yr interval covered by the merged cfht and mcdonald data sets , as would be expected for keplerian motion , and that no changes were observed in the spectral line bisectors . on the other hand",
    ", a careful re - analysis of the changes in the activity indicator reported by @xcite revealed that the periodicity of the @xmath198662 measurements ( 2.14 yr ) is not only slightly different from that in the velocities , but it is transitory in nature , thus ruling out a connection .    also carries the distinction of being among the first planet host stars to be found in a binary system , which raises interesting issues related to the dynamical stability of such configurations .",
    "a recent study by @xcite points out that among the known planet host stars  happens to be the system with the smallest ratio ( @xmath011 ) between the size of the binary orbit and the planetary orbit . however , the outer orbit is at present poorly known , and the secondary star is presumably very faint and has never been seen .",
    "reported values for the binary period have ranged between 29.9  yr @xcite and 66  yr @xcite , and have been based on only part of the data available , in some cases spanning much less than a full cycle .",
    "a number of authors have carried out numerical investigations of the gravitational influence of the secondary star on the orbit of the planet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but have used rather different parameters for the binary or have pointed out the uncertainty in those elements as a limiting factor .",
    "the motivation for this paper is thus threefold : @xmath20 ) to improve the determination of the orbit of the secondary star ( including for the first time an estimate of the inclination angle , and of the mass of the secondary ) in order to allow more definitive dynamical studies of the stability and evolution of the system .",
    "we do this by using all available radial velocity data for  including new measurements reported here and other historical observations not previously used .",
    "we incorporate also astrometric measurements from the _ hipparcos _ mission (  abscissa residuals  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as transit circle and other positional information spanning more than a century .",
    "@xmath21 ) to carry out a critical review of previous studies of the physical properties of the primary star and use all available information to estimate its absolute mass , a key parameter influencing the mass of the substellar companion .",
    "@xmath22 ) to place firm dynamical upper limits on the mass of this companion by taking advantage of the high - precision _ hipparcos _ intermediate data and modeling the reflex motion of the primary star on the plane of the sky .",
    "we show that this modeling allows us to confirm the substellar nature of the companion , although it is not yet possible to rule out a mass in the brown dwarf regime .",
    "we describe here all spectroscopic and astrometric measurements of  of which we are aware that have a bearing on the motion of the star , with the goal of combining them into a global orbital solution in  [ sec : orbit ] .",
    "the high - precision doppler measurements of  have been described in detail by @xcite .",
    "they consist of 4 separate data sets corresponding to different instrument configurations : three from the mcdonald observatory ( referred to below as mcdonald  i , mcdonald  ii , and mcdonald  iii , following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and one from the cfht , which is the data set of @xcite .",
    "the nominal precision of these measurements ranges from about 8  to @xmath030  , and they are all differential in nature as they rely on the use of telluric o@xmath23 lines as the velocity metric , or on lines of hydrogen fluoride or iodine gas that play the same role . taken together these velocities cover the interval 1981.42002.9 , which includes periastron passage in the binary orbit .",
    "@xcite combined these data and solved simultaneously for the outer orbit and the orbit of the planet .",
    "the time span of the observations is less than half of their estimated binary period of 57  yr .    beginning in the late 1970",
    "s  was monitored spectroscopically using more traditional means by @xcite . to their own observations with several different instruments in cambridge ( england ) , haute - provence ( france ) , and victoria ( canada ) , they added a subset of the high - precision velocities mentioned above as well as other velocities collected from the literature in an effort to extend the time coverage and better constrain the outer orbit .",
    "these include measures published by @xcite made in 19781980 , and most importantly the velocities obtained at the lick observatory in 18961921 @xcite .",
    "all these measurements were placed by @xcite on the same zero point ( corresponding to their cambridge instrument ) , and have formal uncertainties ranging from 0.2  to 0.9  .",
    "we adopt these 77 measurements as published .",
    "these authors noted an unfortunate gap of some 50 years in the velocity coverage for  that complicates the determination of the orbital period ( see also  [ sec : period ] ) . in order to distinguish between two possible periods ( 66  yr and 77  yr ) allowed by the radial velocity data they used",
    ", they considered also other measurements from the literature in the interval 19021907 @xcite .",
    "they found that those velocities favored the 66-yr period , although they did not actually make use of them in their orbital solution because of their uncertain zero point .    our own contribution to",
    "the observational material is twofold . on the one hand",
    "we have derived 3 new velocities for  based on archival spectra collected at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) using an echelle spectrograph on the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the f.  l.  whipple observatory .",
    "the nominal precision of these measurements is around 0.3  for a bright and sharp - lined star such as this . for details on the reduction procedures",
    "we refer the reader to the description by @xcite .",
    "while this contribution is modest by comparison to the material described earlier , it does extend the time coverage to the end of 2004 , and the velocities are on a well - defined system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the poor spectroscopic coverage prior to 1978 , we carried out a careful search of the literature for additional measurements that might help constrain the outer orbit .",
    "aside from the 19021907 sources mentioned above that were used only as supporting evidence by @xcite , a number of other velocity sources were found but their zero points are generally unknown , so the measurements can not be combined at face value .",
    "thus as a second contribution we relied on the extensive cfa database of @xmath0@xmath24 spectra to place all of those scattered measurements of  onto a uniform frame of reference .",
    "this was accomplished by using measurements for other stars also reported in each of these sources , and comparing them with newly derived velocities for those same `` standards '' from cfa spectra obtained at one time or another over the past 25 years .",
    "details of this procedure are provided in the appendix .",
    "of particular relevance are the  measurements by @xcite made in 1977 , @xcite in 19721974 , @xcite in 1955 , and @xcite in 1921 .",
    "the precision of those velocities ranges from 0.5  to about 1.9  .",
    "we list them in table  [ tab : rvcfa ] along with our own measurements , all on the cfa system .    despite our attempts to establish their zero points ,",
    "two of the sources of historical velocities showed large discrepancies when compared with other data taken at similar times , or presented other problems .",
    "the series of measurements by @xcite contains only 5 other stars usable as standards , and the offset required to place those velocities on the cfa system has the largest uncertainty ( @xmath01  ) .",
    "the corrected  velocities from 1903 are some 3  too high . three velocities measured at mt .",
    "wilson observatory in 19151917 @xcite show the largest spread of any data set ( 4  ) .",
    "the zero point of those measurements is very difficult to establish because of the variety of instruments and telescopes used , which are not always indicated in the original publication .",
    "the average of the corrected velocities for  shows a discrepancy of 5  relative to others made within a few years .",
    "we have therefore not made use of either of these two data sets in our orbital solution described in ",
    "[ sec : orbit ] .",
    "several high - dispersion plates of  were obtained by @xcite in 19631964 , a critical time in the observational history of this object , but unfortunately the authors appear not to have measured radial velocities . finally , @xcite published a velocity measurement for  made in 1979 , but all of the other stars reported in their paper happen to be variable , and so can not be used as standards .      was observed by the _ hipparcos _",
    "satellite between 1989 and 1993 @xcite .",
    "these accurate one - dimensional astrometric measurements were used by the science team to derive the position , proper motion , and trigonometric parallax of the object ( @xmath25  mas ) as reported in the main catalog .",
    "the astrometric solution revealed a measurable acceleration on the plane of the sky ( proper motion derivatives ) in the amount of @xmath26  mas  yr@xmath27 in right ascension and a more significant @xmath28  mas  yr@xmath27 in declination .",
    "this acceleration is of course due to the binary nature of the object , and was accounted for in deriving the parallax .",
    "as we demonstrate below , the binary motion at the epoch of the _ hipparcos _ observations is such that we expect some curvature on the plane of the sky that should be detectable in the measurements .",
    "we have therefore made use of these observations ( available in the form of `` abscissa residuals '' ) in our orbital solution described below , since they are complementary to the spectroscopic observations and provide new information .",
    "a total of 76 such measurements were obtained by the two independent data reduction consortia @xcite , and the median error for a single measurement is 1.9  mas .    because of the relatively short time span of these observations compared to the binary orbital period , it is almost certain that part of the orbital motion has been absorbed into the proper motion components reported by _",
    "this is in fact a way in which many long - period binaries have been discovered in the past , on the basis of the apparent variability of their proper motions when computed at different epochs ( see , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "precisely this effect was pointed out for  by @xcite , who noticed a significant change mostly in @xmath29 over several decades .",
    "therefore , to make proper use of the _ hipparcos _ intermediate data to extract information on the binary orbit it is necessary to constrain the proper motion by other means in order to model the orbital motion without risking systematic errors .",
    "initially we considered using the proper motion for  reported in the tycho-2 catalog @xcite , which relies on ground - based positional measurements made over many decades and is constrained at the recent epoch by the tycho-2 position .",
    "this long baseline presumably averages out any perturbations due to orbital motion if the period is significantly shorter than this .",
    "the tycho-2 proper motion is in fact quite different from the _ hipparcos _ determination , which is effectively `` instantaneous '' at the mean epoch @xmath01991.25 . in the case of , however , the orbital period is not negligible compared to the time span , and we were concerned that @xmath30 and @xmath29 might be biased .",
    "evidence that the orbital motion is detectable in the individual positional measurements from transit circle observations was indeed presented by @xcite , who inferred from them a period of about 45  yr for the binary .",
    "we therefore chose to make use of the individual positions from ground - based catalogs going back to 1898 , kindly provided by s.  urban of the u.s .",
    "naval observatory ( usno ) .",
    "additional measurements from the carlsberg meridian catalogs ( cmc ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were provided by g.gontcharov ( pulkovo observatory ) or obtained from the literature .",
    "all of these measurements have been reduced to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) , effectively represented in the optical by the _ hipparcos _ catalog , and",
    "their nominal precision varies between about 50 and 500  mas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we list them in table  [ tab : astrometry ] .",
    "the combination of the radial velocity mesurements and the astrometry makes it possible to derive the complete set of elements describing the binary orbit in .",
    "the inclination angle is of particular interest because when combined with the spectroscopic mass function it provides the information needed to compute the mass of the secondary star , given an estimate of the primary mass .",
    "the substellar companion to the primary introduces additional components of motion that we model simultaneously .",
    "given that the outer orbit is an order of magnitude larger than the inner orbit ( see  [ sec : introduction ] ) , to first order we assume here that they are decoupled , i.e. , that the outer one may be treated as corresponding to a `` binary '' composed of the secondary star ( b ) and the center of mass of the inner pair ( a ) .",
    "orbital elements that refer to the outer orbit are indicated below with the subindex `` ab '' , and those pertaining to the inner orbit are distinguished with a subindex `` a '' . the primary star itself is referred to as `` aa '' following the traditional spectroscopic notation , and the planet ( indistinctly called also ` substellar companion ' ) as `` @xmath31 '' , for simplicity .    the radial velocities allow us to solve for the period , center - of - mass velocity of the ( triple ) system , eccentricity , velocity semi - amplitude , longitude of periastron , and time of periastron passage in the outer orbit : \\{@xmath32 , @xmath15 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36}. the high - precision velocities constrain the spectroscopic elements of the inner ( planetary ) orbit : \\{@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41}. because the high - precision velocities are differential , an offset must be determined to place them on the frame of the absolute velocities , for which we have chosen the griffin data set as the reference .",
    "we therefore solved for 4 additional parameters representing these offsets , one for each data set : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for the groups referred to as mcdonald  i , mcdonald  ii , and mcdonald  iii ( see  [ sec : velocities ] ) , and @xmath45 for the cfht data set .",
    "the cfa velocities and other historical data sets placed on the cfa system were considered as a single group , and one additional parameter @xmath46 was included to represent the shift relative to griffin .",
    "preliminary estimates suggested the secondary star is very small compared to the primary , and we may assume here that it contributes no light .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ observations therefore refer strictly to the primary as opposed to the center of light , and provide a constraint on the orientation of the outer orbit ( inclination angle @xmath47 and position angle of the ascending node @xmath48 , referred to the equinox of j2000 ) as well as on the angular scale of the orbit of the inner binary relative to the barycenter ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we show below that the astrometric measurements do not , however , resolve the wobble of the primary star caused by the planet .",
    "we point out also that there are no available measurements of the relative position between the two stars , since the secondary has never been resolved .",
    "the use of the _ hipparcos _ measurements in the global solution introduces several other parameters that must be solved for , including corrections to the catalog values of the position of the barycenter ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) at the mean reference epoch of 1991.25 , and corrections to the proper motion components ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 . ] . in principle",
    "we also need to solve for a correction to the _ hipparcos _ parallax .",
    "however , the fact that the spectroscopic elements of the outer orbit are solved for at the same time introduces a redundancy , and the parallax ( which in this case would be termed an `` orbital '' parallax ) can be expressed in terms of other elements as @xmath55 where the period is given in days and @xmath34 in .",
    "we have therefore chosen to eliminate the parallax correction as an adjustable parameter .    by combining complementary observations of different kinds",
    "the global solution is strengthened .",
    "the ground - based positional measurements provide the tightest constraint on the proper motion and position of the barycenter .",
    "this breaks the strong correlation between proper motion and orbital motion in the _ hipparcos _ observations , and enables those measurements to provide a constraint on the angular scale and orientation of the outer orbit , even though their coverage is only a small fraction of the orbital period .",
    "some information on the scale and orientation , as well as on the outer period , is provided also by the positional measurements , while the velocities contribute most of the weight to the period , shape , and linear scale of the binary orbit .",
    "the elements of the inner orbit are constrained only by the high - precision velocity measurements , and are only weakly dependent on the outer orbit .",
    "light - travel effects in the inner orbit are negligibly small .",
    "the formalism for incorporating the abscissa residuals from _ hipparcos _ into the fit follows closely that described by @xcite and @xcite , including the correlations between measurements from the two independent data reduction consortia @xcite . in using the ground - based catalog positions",
    "the parallactic motion was accounted for in our model , given that the precision of some of the more recent measurements is comparable to the parallax .",
    "altogether there are 23 unknowns that we solved for simultaneously , using standard non - linear least - squares techniques @xcite .",
    "the solution converged quickly from initial values of the elements chosen from preliminary fits or by an extensive grid search , and experiments in which we varied the initial values within reason yielded the same results .",
    "a total of 446 individual observations were used from 10 different data sets , as follows : 107 classical radial velocities ( 77 from griffin , 30 from cfa and other literature sources ) , 199 high - precision velocities ( 68 from cfht , 43 from mcdonald  i , 49 from mcdonald  ii , and 39 from mcdonald  iii ) , 76 one - dimensional _ hipparcos _ measurements , and 64 ground - based catalog coordinates ( split into two data sets of 15 and 17 pairs of right ascension and declination measurements ) .",
    "weights were assigned to the measurements according to their individual errors . since internal errors are not always realistic , we adjusted them by applying a scale factor in such a way as to achieve a reduced @xmath56 value near unity separately for each data set .",
    "this was done by iterations .",
    "these scale factors were all close to unity for most of the velocity sets , and somewhat larger for some of the ground - based catalog positions .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : elements ] , along with derived quantities such as the position of the barycenter at the mean epoch of the _ hipparcos _ catalog ( 1991.25 ) , the parallax and proper motion components , and the mass function of the stellar binary .",
    "other derived quantities are described below .",
    "the elements of the planetary orbit are not significantly different from those reported by @xcite since that orbit depends essentially only on the high - precision velocities , for which we used the same data they used .",
    "the parallax is also not appreciably different from the _ hipparcos _ value , although our uncertainty is somewhat smaller .",
    "the proper motion components , on the other hand , are considerably different from their catalog values , as anticipated above .",
    "the radial velocity measurements are represented graphically in figure  [ fig : rvs1 ] .",
    "the top panel shows only the classical measurements .",
    "the small undulations in the computed curve are produced by the wobble of the primary star with the 2.47-yr period of the substellar companion .",
    "although the phase coverage in the outer orbit is incomplete , the period of the binary is fairly well established thanks in part to the very high precision of the mcdonald and cfht data ( see also  [ sec : period ] ) .",
    "these are shown separately in the lower panel , where the error bars are smaller than the size of the points .",
    "the reflex motion of the primary due to the substellar companion is shown as a function of orbital phase in figure  [ fig : rvs2 ] , where the motion in the outer orbit has been subtracted from the individual data sets .",
    "the residuals from the new cfa velocities and from other values from the literature sources placed on the same system are given in table  [ tab : rvcfa ] .",
    "the path of  on the plane of the sky is represented in figure  [ fig : hiporb3 ] , where the axes are parallel to the right ascension and declination directions .",
    "the solid curve is the result of the contributions from the annual proper motion ( arrow ) , the parallactic motion , and the motion in the binary .",
    "the wobble due to the substellar companion is negligible on the scale of this figure ( see also  [ sec : planet ] ) .",
    "the predicted location of the one - dimensional _ hipparcos _ observations is indicated by the dots on the curve .",
    "as stated earlier , their typical uncertainty is 1.9 mas . for illustration purposes , the dotted line in the figure starting at the location of the first _ hipparcos _",
    "observation shows the path the star would follow _ without _ the perturbation from the orbital motion in the binary .",
    "the orbit of the primary star in  around the center of mass of the binary is shown in figure  [ fig : hiporb2 ] , with a semimajor axis of about 325 mas .",
    "the direction of motion is retrograde ( arrow ) .",
    "the intersection between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky ( line of nodes ) is represented by the dotted line . the section of the orbit covered by the _ hipparcos",
    "_ mission is indicated with filled circles , and the open circle labeled `` p '' represents periastron .",
    "a close - up of the area around the _ hipparcos _ observations is shown in figure  [ fig : hiporb2e ] .",
    "because these measurements are one - dimensional in nature , their exact location on the plane of the sky can not be shown graphically .",
    "the filled circles represent the predicted location on the computed orbit .",
    "the dotted lines connecting to each filled circle indicate the scanning direction of the _ hipparcos _ satellite for each measurement , and show which side of the orbit the residual is on .",
    "the short line segments at the end of and perpendicular to the dotted lines indicate the direction along which the actual observation lies , although the precise location is undetermined . occasionally more than one measurement was taken along the same scanning direction , in which case two or more short line segments appear on the same dotted lines .",
    "the motion of  a in the binary orbit is discernible in the ground - based catalog measurements taken over the last century , although only in the declination direction .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : wobble1 ] .",
    "the amplitude of motion in the r.a.direction is much smaller because of the orientation of the orbit , which is mostly north - south .",
    "the more recent measurements since 1980 are much more precise .",
    "that section of the orbit is shown on a larger scale in figure  [ fig : wobble2 ] .",
    "the residuals of all ground - based measurements from our orbital solution are given in table  [ tab : astrometry ] .",
    "the poor observational coverage of  prior to 1980 has made it difficult to establish the period of the outer orbit in previous studies , particularly since the secondary star has never been resolved .",
    "@xcite gave a rough estimate of 29.9  yr based on only 10  yr of high - precision velocity coverage .",
    "@xcite used the ground - based catalog positions spanning a little less than six decades and inferred a period of 45  yr . a re - reduction of those same data ( g.  gontcharov 2006 , private communication ) does not show that periodicity as clearly , however .",
    "the radial - velocity study by @xcite took advantage of some of the historical measurements going back more than 100  yr , and found that a 50-yr gap in the data near the middle of the last century allowed two possible periods giving fits of similar quality : @xmath066  yr and @xmath077  yr . on the basis of other observational evidence they chose the short orbital period .",
    "@xcite used 20  yr worth of high - precision velocity measurements and derived a period of 57  yr .",
    "the simultaneous use of all of the above measurements , and the addition of other observations ( including more recent velocities as well as historical velocities , and the _ hipparcos _ measurements ) , have allowed us to finally constrain the binary period without ambiguity to a value of 66.8  yr , thus proving @xcite essentially correct . to illustrate the improvement brought about by the added observations , we have recreated the fit by @xcite by using the same set of observations they used , ignoring the velocity perturbation from the substellar companion , as they did . in figure",
    "[ fig : period ] we show the reduced @xmath56 of the fit for a range of fixed orbital periods , with the remaining orbital elements adjusted as usual to minimize @xmath56 .",
    "we then repeated this exercise using the data that went into our own solution , this time accounting properly for the planetary companion .",
    "the dashed curve corresponding to the solution by @xcite shows two local minima at @xmath066  yr and @xmath077  yr , as found by those authors .",
    "the solid curve corresponding to the solution in this paper that includes all available observations has a single minimum at 66.8  yr .",
    "the formal uncertainty in this value is 1.4  yr , or 2% .",
    "in order to take full advantage of the orbital solution presented above and estimate the mass of the unseen secondary star , as well as to place limits on the mass of the substellar companion , we require an estimate of the mass of the primary star itself ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "mass estimates in the literature for  have varied by more than a factor of two ( between @xmath00.8  m@xmath5 and @xmath01.7  m@xmath5 ) , which is somewhat surprising for such a bright and well - studied star but may perhaps be explained by its present evolutionary state and other uncertainties ( see below ) .",
    "we wish to constrain it to much better than this to avoid propagating the uncertainty to other quantities that depend on the mass . in this section",
    "we therefore examine the available observational material carefully and critically , making use of current stellar evolution models to arrive at the best possible estimate for @xmath57 .",
    "we discuss some of the other estimates as well in an attempt to understand the differences .",
    "the brightness of  has made it an easy target for spectroscopic studies to determine both the effective temperature and chemical composition of the star .",
    "these , along with other properties , are essential in order to estimate its absolute mass . in table",
    "[ tab : specmet ] we have collected the results of nearly two dozen separate investigations carried out over the past 40 years .",
    "we consider here only determinations of @xmath58 and [ fe / h ] that are purely spectroscopic . our own temperature estimate from the spectra described in ",
    "[ sec : velocities ] is listed as well ( see  [ sec : appendix ] for the details of our procedures ) . for the most part",
    "the 22 independent metallicity determinations show reasonable agreement within the errors , and yield a weighted average of [ fe / h ] = @xmath59 , or very nearly solar .",
    "further comments on this value are given below .",
    "the weighted average effective temperature is @xmath60  k from 9 spectroscopic measurements including our own .",
    "the uncertainties given here are statistical errors that account for the different weights as well as the scatter of the individual [ fe / h ] and @xmath58 measurements , but not for possible systematics . in the following we adopt for these averages more conservative errors of 0.05 dex and 100  k , respectively .",
    "temperature estimates for the star have been derived on numerous occasions also from color indices in a variety of photometric systems . in order to bring homogeneity to this information we have compiled the available photometry for  in eight different systems ( johnson , strmgren , vilnius , geneva , cousins , ddo , 2mass , and tycho ) mostly from the photometric database maintained by @xcite , and we have used the color / temperature calibrations for giant stars from @xcite for 13 different photometric indices .",
    "interstellar reddening has been ignored here in view of the close distance to the star ( 13.8  pc ) , but we have accounted for the very small metallicity correction in each calibration based on the discussion above .",
    "the results are collected in table  [ tab : photometry ] , where the uncertainty of each temperature estimate includes the contribution from photometric errors as well as the statistical uncertainty of the calibration , added in quadrature .",
    "the weighted average of these determinations is @xmath61  k , although we prefer 100  k as a more realistic error to account for unquantified systematics .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric temperature estimates thus differ by only 100  k , and we adopt here the compromise value of @xmath62  k.    two additional properties of the star that can be determined very accurately are the absolute visual magnitude and the linear radius .",
    "the absolute magnitude follows from @xmath63 @xcite and our parallax for the system ( table  [ tab : elements ] ) , and is @xmath64 .",
    "the angular diameter of  has been measured directly with high precision by @xcite using the navy prototype optical interferometer , and is @xmath65  mas ( limb - darkened value ) .",
    "combined once again with our parallax , this measurement yields the linear radius as @xmath66  r@xmath5 , which has a formal precision just over 1% .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tracks1 ] we compare the measured temperature and absolute visual magnitude of the star with evolutionary tracks from the series by @xcite and @xcite for the composition established above .",
    "tracks are labeled with the mass in solar units .",
    "the star is seen to be in the first ascent of the giant branch .",
    "the shaded error box is shown more clearly in the inset , which suggests a mass for  slightly over 1.2  m@xmath5 and an uncertainty in that value determined almost entirely by the temperature error at this fixed metallicity .",
    "if the radius is used instead of the temperature , the constraint on the mass is considerably improved because of the smaller relative error of @xmath67 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : tracks2 ] , which indicates a mass also close to 1.2  m@xmath5 , consistent with the previous figure . in both cases",
    "the uncertainty in the metallicity is also important , as a change in [ fe / h ] shifts the tracks essentially horizontally .",
    "the optimal value of the mass is one that yields the best simultaneous match to the four measured quantities ( @xmath58 , [ fe / h ] , @xmath68 , and @xmath67 ) within their stated errors . to determine this value , as well as its uncertainty , we computed by interpolation evolutionary tracks in a fine grid for a range of masses and also a range of metallicities within the observational uncertainty of [ fe / h ] . at each point along the tracks we compared the predicted stellar properties with the measurements , and recorded all models that agree with the observations within their errors .",
    "all such models are displayed in figure  [ fig : agemass ] in a mass / age diagram .",
    "it is seen that at each mass the range of allowed ages is very narrow .",
    "the best match is for a mass of @xmath69  m@xmath5 , and the corresponding evolutionary age is @xmath70  gyr .",
    "all four measured quantities are reproduced to well within their errors ( better than 0.3@xmath13 ) , an indication that they are mutually consistent .",
    "the surface gravity predicted by the best model is @xmath71 .",
    "an independent age estimate was obtained by @xcite based on the chromospheric activity indicator @xmath72 .",
    "their result ( 6.39  gyr ) using the calibration by @xcite agrees very well with ours formally , although chromospheric ages for older objects tend to be rather uncertain .",
    "there are significant differences between our mass and other recent estimates .",
    "almost all of them rely on evolutionary models and use different combinations of observational constraints .",
    "for example , @xcite derived a value of 1.59  m@xmath5 with a formal error less than 10% , from a fit to the effective temperature and bolometric magnitude ( derived using the _ hipparcos _ parallax ) for a fixed metallicity that is higher than ours ( see table  [ tab : specmet ] ) .",
    "this mass estimate was adopted by @xcite to infer the minimum mass of the substellar companion to .",
    "@xcite obtained an even larger primary mass of 1.7  m@xmath5 ( no uncertainty given ) from a fit to their own @xmath73 and @xmath68 ( also based on the _ hipparcos _ parallax ) , using their [ fe / h ] determination that is again higher than ours . @xcite",
    "used @xmath68 and @xmath74 directly and inferred @xmath75  m@xmath5 , but apparently made no use of any measured metallicity . a lower mass than ours ( @xmath76  m@xmath5 ) was derived by @xcite from the luminosity and temperature they determined for , along with their [ fe / h ] value , which is close to solar .",
    "@xcite obtained 1.5  m@xmath5 employing a similar method , but adopted a metallicity much lower than ours . except for the latter study ,",
    "the evolutionary models used by most of these authors are similar enough that the differences in mass must be due in large part to the observational constraints , particularly the temperature and metallicity .",
    "we note also that none of these studies have made use of the measured angular diameter of the star , which appears to be very accurate .",
    "an entirely different approach was followed by @xcite , who inferred a mass from their spectroscopic @xmath77 determination along with a linear radius derived from surface brightness relations ( @xmath78  r@xmath5 ) .",
    "their value is @xmath79  m@xmath5 .",
    "the larger estimates of @xmath57 tend to be those based on hotter temperatures and also higher metallicities .",
    "furthermore , a look at table  [ tab : specmet ] shows that while most of the metallicity determinations for  are close to solar , all the higher values have been reported only in the last few years , and they tend to go together with hotter temperatures ( see figure  [ fig : teffmet ] ) .",
    "we note in this connection that  has been considered a member of a group of evolved stars displaying cn bands that are stronger than usual (  strong - cn stars  , or",
    " very - strong - lined stars  ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was classified by the latter authors as k1  iii - iv  cn  1 , which corresponds only to a marginal strong - cn star .",
    "these objects have had a controversial history , occasionally having been considered to be super - metal - rich .",
    "other studies have disputed this , however .",
    "for example , some of the giants in the open cluster m67 have been found to have strong cn features even though the chemical composition of this cluster is believed to be essentially solar ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we refer the reader to the latter work ( and references therein ) for an excellent summary of the subject and a list of possible explanations for the cn phenomenon .    as tempting as it may be to place higher confidence in some of the more recent [ fe / h ] studies that have found a metal - rich composition for , it is difficult to ignore the large body of equally careful determinations yielding a composition closer to solar .",
    "this includes the recent work of @xcite , which not only gives a slightly subsolar metallicity but also happens to have the smallest formal uncertainty ; their result is [ fe / h ] = @xmath80 . as a test we repeated the comparison with stellar evolution models described earlier , but adopting the spectroscopic temperature and metallicity determinations of each of the recent studies that give super - solar abundances . in no case",
    "did we find a model that is simultaneously consistent with all four of the quantities @xmath73 , [ fe / h ] , @xmath68 and @xmath67 , within their uncertainties .",
    "we are led to conclude , therefore , that the chemical composition of  is _ not _ significantly higher than solar , and we adopt in the following the mass we determined above with the most conservative of the asymmetric error bars : @xmath81  m@xmath5 .    with this value and the mass function from our orbital solution",
    "the mass of the unseen stellar companion is @xmath82",
    "m@xmath5 , where the error is computed from the full covariance matrix resulting from our fit ( including cross - terms ) and accounts also for the primary mass uncertainty , which represents the dominant contribution .",
    "thus the secondary is most likely a late - type star of spectral type approximately m4 .",
    "the angular semimajor axis of the relative orbit between the primary and secondary becomes @xmath83 arcsec , which corresponds to @xmath3 au .    with the secondary mass known ,",
    "it is of interest to compute its brightness relative to the primary in order to assess the chance of detecting it directly , most likely in the infrared .",
    "the brightness measurements of the primary itself in the near infrared are rather uncertain because the star saturated the 2mass detectors ( see table  [ tab : photometry ] ) . from our best model",
    "fits we derive absolute magnitudes of @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the johnson system , which are actually consistent with the values inferred from the 2mass photometry within their large errors .",
    "the brightness of the secondary star may be estimated also from stellar evolution models .",
    "for this we have used the calculations by @xcite , since those of @xcite are not intended for low - mass stars . for the age we established above",
    "we obtain @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , which we have placed on the same photometric system as @xcite following the prescription by @xcite .",
    "thus , the secondary is expected to be @xmath08.4 mag fainter than  a in @xmath9 , @xmath06.6 mag fainter in @xmath89 , and @xmath06.4 mag fainter in @xmath10 . may be overestimated by up to 0.5 mag due to the possibility of missing opacities in the models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would affect the optical the most .",
    "]    the orbital elements in table  [ tab : elements ] allow the relative position of the unseen secondary to be predicted .",
    "we note , however , that the scale of the relative orbit still depends critically on the assumed primary mass as @xmath90 , in which the secondary mass itself scales as @xmath91 .",
    "as seen earlier @xmath57 is quite sensitive to the adopted temperature and metallicity . a dynamical ( hypothesis - free ) estimate of the masses of both stars and a direct measure of the semimajor axis @xmath92 will be possible once  b is detected and its path around the primary measured over at least a portion of the orbital cycle .",
    "the reflex motion of the primary star along the line of sight in response to the putative substellar companion leads to a mass function of @xmath93  m@xmath5 from our orbital fit . with the adopted value of @xmath57 this corresponds to @xmath94  m@xmath12 , which is only slightly smaller than the value @xmath95",
    "m@xmath12 reported by @xcite .",
    "the difference is due almost entirely to the choice of primary mass , for which they used @xmath96  m@xmath5 .    the perturbation on the primary star on the plane of the sky caused by the substellar companion is expected to be small , although it depends obviously on the unknown inclination angle @xmath97 ( and through it on @xmath98 ) .",
    "given that the _ hipparcos _ measurements are fairly precise , we attempted to determine this astrometric wobble simultaneously with the other elements by incorporating additional adjustable parameters into the model .",
    "four of the elements of this astrometric orbit are already known from spectroscopy ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ) .",
    "the remaining three are the angular scale ( semimajor axis ) of the orbit of the primary around its center of mass with the planet ( @xmath99 ) , the inclination angle of the planetary orbit ( @xmath97 ) , and the position angle of the ascending node ( @xmath100 , j2000 ) .",
    "since spectroscopy gives the projected linear semimajor axis ( @xmath101 ) , and the parallax is a known function of other elements ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] ) , we take advantage of the redundancy to eliminate the angular semimajor axis @xmath99 as an adjustable parameter , given that it can be expressed as @xmath102 a solution with a total of 25 adjustable parameters did not yield a statistically significant detection of the astrometric wobble : the best fit corresponded to an inclination angle 19  from face - on , implying a semimajor axis @xmath103  mas and a planet mass around 4  m@xmath12 .    in order to place a meaningful upper limit on @xmath98",
    "we explored the full range of possible values of @xmath97 and @xmath100 to identify the area of parameter space where the solutions become inconsistent with the observational errors . for each pair of fixed values of @xmath97 and @xmath100 we solved for the other 23 parameters of the fit as usual .",
    "a false alarm probability can be attached to the @xmath104 ( increase in @xmath56 compared to the minimum ) associated with each of these solutions . in this way",
    "we may determine the minimum value of @xmath105 ( highest value of @xmath98 ) for a given confidence level .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : planetmass ] , where we show the region of parameter space in the two variables of interest along with confidence contours .",
    "the light gray area corresponds to solutions that can only be ruled out at confidence levels up to 1@xmath13 ( @xmath068% ) , and includes our best fit mentioned above ( indicated with a plus sign ) .",
    "the middle gray area is the region between 1@xmath13 and 2@xmath13 , and the dark gray area corresponds to confidence levels between 2@xmath13 and 3@xmath13 . at the 2@xmath13 level ( @xmath095% confidence ) the observations rule out companion masses larger than 13.3  m@xmath12 ( or inclination angles less than @xmath106 from face - on ) , which would induce reflex motions on the primary with a semiamplitude of at least 1.5  mas .",
    "this mass corresponds roughly to the conventional boundary between planetary and brown - dwarf masses . at a higher confidence level of 3@xmath13 ( 99.73% )",
    "the mass limit is 16.9  m@xmath12 ( or @xmath107 ) , which would produce a wobble with a semiamplitude of about 1.8  mas .",
    "there is little doubt , therefore , that the companion is substellar .",
    "in their paper @xcite attempted to place limits on the mass of the substellar companion in a different way by using their measured projected rotational velocity for  ( @xmath108  ) along with the period they determined for the variation of the  @xmath198662 emission - line index ( @xmath109  days ) and the estimated radius of the star ( @xmath110  r@xmath5 , adopted from * ? ? ?",
    "they relied on two assumptions : that the spin axis of the star is parallel to the axis of the planetary orbit , and that the period of variation of the index represents the true rotation period of the star .",
    "the comparison between the measured @xmath111 and the expected equatorial rotational velocity ( @xmath112 ) then gives limits on @xmath113 ( or @xmath105 in our notation ) . as it turns out , however , there is a mathematical error in their calculation of @xmath112 : they reported @xmath114  , while the correct value is 0.3  ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since this is _ smaller _ than their @xmath115 , no limits can be placed on @xmath105 in this way .",
    "their statement on the probable mass range of the planetary companion is therefore not valid .",
    "either the measured @xmath111 is overestimated , or the period of the variations is not the true rotation period of the star .",
    "the former explanation is perhaps supported by a measurement by @xcite , who gave @xmath116  ( along with a sizeable radial - tangential macroturbulence of @xmath117  , which can effect rotational velocity measurements if not properly accounted for ) .",
    "the study by @xcite reported @xmath118  .",
    "alternatively , the rotation period would have to be considerably shorter than 781 days ( @xmath119100500 days ) , and another explanation would have to be found for the variations in the emission - line index .",
    "our dynamical constraint on @xmath98 thus shows for the first time that the companion is substellar in nature , although a mass in the brown dwarf regime ( as opposed to the planetary regime ) can not be completely ruled out with the present observations .",
    "is one of more than two dozen examples of substellar companions found in stellar binaries ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such systems have attracted considerable interest in recent years , and numerical studies have been carried out specifically for the case of  to assess not only the dynamical stability of the orbit of the substellar companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also the stability of the orbits of other ( possibly earth - like ) planets that might be present in the habitable zone of the primary star .",
    "@xcite have also investigated the conditions under which the substellar companion may form through core accretion in the binary environment . with a relative semimajor axis for the planet orbit of @xmath120  au ( for an adopted primary mass @xmath81  m@xmath5 ) ,",
    "the size of that orbit is only 9.8 times smaller than the size of the binary orbit ( 19.02  au ; see table  [ tab : elements ] ) , currently the lowest value among the known exoplanets in binaries11 given by @xcite is largely due to the significant improvement in the elements of the binary orbit in the present work . ] .",
    "orbit stability depends quite strongly on the parameters of the binary system , in particular the semimajor axis and eccentricity , as well as on the masses of the components .",
    "the dynamical studies mentioned above have all had to make do with the rather poorly determined binary properties and also often inconsistent results from various authors .",
    "@xcite have derived a simple empirical formula for computing the maximum value of the semimajor axis of a stable planetary orbit ( `` critical '' semimajor axis , @xmath121 ) in a coplanar s - type planet - binary system .",
    "@xcite pointed out in his study that the uncertainty in the binary orbital elements made for a very large parameter space to be explored numerically for .",
    "furthermore , the inclination of the binary orbit was unknown at the time and therefore so was the mass of the secondary star .",
    "as a result , he was only able to provide a rather wide range of critical semimajor axes as a function of the adopted binary eccentricity ( see his figure  1 ) . with the present study that situation has changed , and the critical semimajor axis can now be computed directly with a relatively small formal uncertainty .",
    "we obtain @xmath122  au , which is considerably larger than the semimajor axis of the planet orbit , implying the latter is stable if coplanar with the binary .",
    "the combination of classical as well as high - precision radial velocity measurements of  with ground- and space - based astrometry have allowed a significant improvement in the binary orbital elements ( and a first determination of the inclination angle ) as well as a better knowledge of the stellar masses .",
    "nevertheless , the secondary star remains unseen . even though the predicted angular separation of  b ( 084 for 2007.0 ; 099 for 2009.0 ) is not particularly challenging , the 8-magnitude brightness difference in the visual band relative to the glaringly bright primary explains all negative results ( e.g. , the speckle interferometry attempts by mason et al .",
    "2001 , as well as the imaging by hatzes et al .",
    "we expect the contrast to be much more favorable in the near infrared ( @xmath123 in @xmath10 ) , and that this detection should not be very difficult at those wavelengths with adaptive optics on a large telescope",
    ". such measurements of the relative position would allow a dynamical determination of the mass of both stars , free from assumptions .",

    "the historical sources containing radial velocity measurements of  typically include other stars observed either as standards or for other purposes .",
    "the likelihood that many of those stars have been observed multiple times at the cfa is fairly high given that the spectroscopic database at cfa contains tens of thousands of stars and about a quarter of a million spectra to date .",
    "this common ground enables us to place the measurements of each of the sources on the cfa velocity system . in each case",
    "we selected all stars with no obvious signs of velocity variation that have been observed at least 3 times at the cfa .",
    "radial velocities were derived from the available cfa spectra in the same way as those for , by cross - correlation using synthetic templates based on model atmospheres by r.  l.  kurucz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the optimal template for each star was determined from grids of cross - correlations against a large number of synthetic spectra over broad ranges in the template parameters ( mainly the effective temperature and rotational velocity ) , in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "solar metallicity was assumed throughout .",
    "many of the stars are giants but there are some dwarfs as well , so the optimal surface gravity for the template in each case was determined by repeating the procedure above for a range of values of @xmath77 , and selecting the one giving the highest correlation averaged over all exposures of the star .",
    "the radial velocities derived with these templates were then compared with those from each literature source .    some of these sources have relatively few stars that can be used as standards , and rejecting objects that have not been observed at cfa leads to the loss of potentially useful comparison stars in some cases , which can compromise the determination of the offset .",
    "those stars can still be used so long as they are included in another of the data sets , which then provides the link to the cfa system .",
    "thus , instead of separately comparing each source with cfa to determine the corresponding velocity offset , as might commonly be done , we have followed a procedure by which we determine the velocity offsets of all sources simultaneously by minimizing the scatter of the velocities for all standard stars taken together . in this way",
    "any star that is included in at least two of the data sets ( whether or not one of them is cfa ) can be used to strengthen the solution .",
    "the quantity we seek to minimize is @xmath156 where the sums are performed over all data sets ( @xmath157 ) , all stars in each data set ( @xmath158 ) , and all observations of each star ( @xmath159 ) .",

    "table  [ tab : offsets ] presents the results for each data set from our least - squares solution .",
    "we list the derived offset along with its uncertainty , the number of standard stars in each group , the number of observations of , and the interval of those observations . with a few exceptions the total number of standard star observations used in each data set is typically a few dozen , while the overall number of cfa observations used for those same standards is @xmath03300 .",
