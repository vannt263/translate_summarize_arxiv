    "it can also provide further insight into the dynamics of solar system shocks and the nonrelativistic astrophysical shocks , like the supernova remnant shocks @xcite .",
    "an obstacle to an in - depth investigation of the laser - generated shocks has been so far , that the frequently used optical probing techniques could not resolve the shock structure at the required spatio - temporal resolution .",
    "the now available proton imaging technique @xcite helps us overcoming this limitation .",
    "this method can provide accurate spatial electric field profiles at a high time resolution , as long as no strong magnetic fields are present . the nonrelativistic flow speed of the laser - generated shock , e.g. that in ref .",

    "the availability of electric field data at a high resolution serves as a motivation to perform related numerical simulations and to compare their results with the experimental ones .",
    "the experimental observations from ref .",
    "@xcite , which are most relevant for the simulation study we perform here , can be summarized as follows .",
    "the ablation of a solid target consisting of aluminium or tungsten by a laser pulse with a duration of @xmath0 470 ps and an intensity of @xmath1 w/@xmath2 results in a plasma with a density @xmath3 @xmath4 and with an electron temperature of a few kev .",
    "this plasma expands into an ambient plasma with the density @xmath5 @xmath4 .",
    "the ambient plasma has been produced mainly by a photo - ionization of the residual gas .",
    "the dominant components of the residual gas , which consists of diluted air , are oxygen and nitrogen .",
    "electrostatic structures , which move through the ionized residual gas , are observed .",
    "their propagation speeds suggest that one is an electrostatic shock @xcite with a thickness of a few electron debye lengths , which is expanding approximately with the ion acoustic velocity @xmath6 m / s .",
    "ion - acoustic solitons are trailing the shock .",
    "another structure moves at twice the shock speed , which is probably related to a shock - reflected ion beam .",
    "the electron - electron , electron - ion and ion - ion mean free paths for the residual gas have been determined for this particular experiment .",
    "they are of the order of cm and much larger than the shock width of a few tens of @xmath7 m . the shock and the electrostatic structures are collision - less",
    ".    the experiment can measure the electric fields , the propagation speed of the electric field structures and it can estimate the electron temperature and density .",
    "the bulk parameters of the ions , such as their temperature , mean speed and ionization state , are currently inaccessible , as well as detailed information about the spatial distribution of the plasma .",
    "we can set up a plasma simulation with the experimentally known parameters , and we can introduce an idealized model for the unknown initial conditions . the detailed information about the state of the plasma , which is provided by vlasov simulations @xcite or by particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite , can then provide further insight into the expansion of this plasma .    here",
    "we investigate a mechanism that could result in the shock observed in ref .",
    "we model with pic simulations the interplay of two plasmas with a large difference in the thermal pressure , which are initially spatially separated .",
    "we aim at determining the spatio - temporal scale , over which a shock forms under this initial assumption , and we want to reveal the structures that develop in the wake of the shock .",
    "the temperature and density of the hot laser - ablated plasma both exceed initially that of the cold ambient plasma by two orders of magnitude . the density ratio is less than that between the expanding and the ambient plasma in ref . @xcite .",
    "however , the density will not change in form of a single jump in the experiment and realistic density changes will probably be less or equal to the one we employ .",
    "selecting the same jump in the density and temperature is computationally efficient , because both plasmas have the same debye length that determines the grid cell size and the allowed time step .",
    "the ion temperature in the experiment is likely to be less than that of the electrons .",
    "the electron distribution can also not be approximated by two separate spatially uniform and thermal electron clouds , because the plasma generation is not fast compared to the electron diffusion .",
    "we show , however , that the shock forms long after the electrons have diffused in the simulation box and reached almost the same temperature everywhere .",
    "a change in the thermal pressure by a factor @xmath8 should imply a plasma expansion that is similar to that into a vacuum .",
    "this process has received attention in the context of auroral , astrophysical and laser - generated plasmas and it has been investigated analytically within the framework of fluid models @xcite or vlasov models @xcite .",
    "it has been modelled numerically using a cold ion fluid and boltzmann - distributed electrons @xcite and with kinetic vlasov and pic simulations @xcite .",
    "the plasma expansion of hot electrons and cool ions into a tenuous medium has also been examined with pic simulations , such as the pioneering study in ref .",
    "@xcite , which reported the formation of a double layer @xcite that can not form if the plasma expands into a vacuum .",
    "our simulation examines also the dynamics of protons as a first step towards a simulation of the mix of oxygen and nitrogen ions that constitute the residual gas in the physical experiment .",
    "notable differences between the expansion of the hot and dense plasma into the ambient plasma and the expansion into a vacuum are observed .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following .",
    "we describe the pic method in section 2 and we give the initial conditions and the simulation parameters .",
    "section 3 models the initial phase of the plasma expansion at a high phase space resolution , revealing details of the electron expansion and of the quasi - equilibrium , which is established for the electrons .",
    "a double layer develops at the thermal pressure jump , which drags the electrons from the tenuous plasma into the hot plasma in form of a cool beam .",
    "the electrons from the hot plasma leak into the cool plasma , which reduces the temperature difference between both plasmas .",
    "section 4 examines the proton dynamics .",
    "the ambient plasma modifies the proton expansion .",
    "the thermal pressure jump evolves into a shock , which moves approximately with the proton thermal speed of the hot plasma .",
    "if the plasma expands into a vacuum , then a plasma density change can only be accomplished by ion beams @xcite , while the plasma is here compressed by the shock . the fastest protons in our simulation form a beam that outruns the shock .",
    "it interacts with the protons of the ambient medium to form phase space holes in the electron and proton distributions .",
    "the proton phase space holes develop into a secondary shock ahead of the primary one .",
    "this process may result in secondary shocks in experiments , similar to the radiation - driven ones @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "a pic code approximates a plasma by an ensemble of computational particles ( cps ) , each of which is representing a phase space volume element .",
    "each cp follows a phase space trajectory that is determined through the lorentz force equation by the electric field @xmath9 and the magnetic field @xmath10 . both fields are evolved self - consistently in time using the maxwell s equations and the macroscopic current @xmath11 , which is the sum over the microcurrents of all cps .",
    "the standard pic method considers only collective interactions between particles , although some collisional effects are introduced through the interaction of cps with the field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "collision operators have been prescribed for pic simulations @xcite .",
    "the structures in the addressed experiment form and evolve in a plasma , in which collisional effects are not strong and such operators are thus not introduced here .",
    "we may illustrate this with the help of the electron collision rate @xmath12 and the ion collision rate @xmath13 @xcite for a spatially uniform plasma with the number density @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and the temperature @xmath16 ( ev ) .",

    "the mean - free path has been estimated to be of the order of a cm @xcite and the ion beam with the speed @xmath23 m / s crosses this distance during the time @xmath24 .",
    "this presumably forms the upper time limit , for which we can neglect collisions .",
    "the presence of particles with kev energies and the preferential expansion direction of the plasma in the experiment imply , that multi - dimensional pic simulations should be electromagnetic in order to resolve the potentially important magnetic weibel instabilities , which are driven by thermal anisotropies @xcite .",
    "such instabilities can grow in the absence of relativistic beams of charged particles , but they are typically weaker than the beam - driven ones @xcite . here",
    "we restrict our simulation to one spatial dimension @xmath25 ( 1d ) and we set @xmath26 .",
    "the plasma expands along @xmath25 and all particle beams will have velocity vectors aligned with @xmath25 .",
    "the magnetic beam - driven instabilities have wavevectors that are oriented obliquely or perpendicular to the beam velocity vector and they are not resolved by a 1d simulation .",
    "the wavevectors , which are destabilized by the weibel instability , can be aligned with the simulation direction , but only if the plasma is cooler along @xmath25 than orthogonally to it .",
    "such a thermal anisotropy can probably not form .",
    "our electromagnetic simulation confirms that no magnetic instability grows .",
    "the ratio of the magnetic to the total energy remains at noise levels below @xmath27 .",
    "a 1d pic simulation should provide a reasonable approximation to those sections of the expanding plasma front observed in ref .",

    "all plasma species have initially a maxwellian velocity distribution , which is at rest in the simulation frame .",
    "the ablated target material drives the plasma expansion but its ions are probably not involved in the evolution of the shock and of the other plasma structures .",
    "these structures are observed already 100 - 200 ps after the laser impact at a distance of about 1 mm from the target .",
    "aluminium ions , which are with a mass @xmath36 the lightest constituents of the target material , would have the thermal speed @xmath37 m / s for @xmath38 = 1 kev .",
    "hundred times this speed or a temperature of 10 mev would be necessary for them to propagate 1 mm in 0.1 ns .",
    "we thus assume here that the shock and the other plasma structures involve only the ions of the residual gas , which is air at a low pressure .",
    "if we assume that these ions have a high ionization state and comparable charge - to - mass ratios , then the protons may provide a reasonable approximation to their dynamics .",

    "@xcite , that considered the plasma expansion into a vacuum . there",
    ", the electron temperature exceeded that of the protons by a factor @xmath180 , while we consider here the same temperature of electrons and protons .",
    "our results are summarized as follows .",
    "an electric field grows almost instantly at the boundary between both plasmas , because the ion expansion of the hot plasma is slower than the electron expansion .",
    "the electric field forms irrespective of the ambient medium .",
    "it accelerates only the ions , if the plasma expands into a vacuum and it has a cusp in its spatial profile .",
    "the acceleration of the electrons of the ambient medium triggers in our simulation the formation of a double layer @xcite with a smooth electric field profile .",
    "this double layer redistributes the momentum between the individual plasma species @xcite . a tenuous hot beam of electrons streams from the hot plasma into the cool plasma , while all the electrons of the cool plasma are dragged into the hot plasma .",
    "these beams thermalize through electrostatic two - stream instabilities , which equilibrate the electron temperatures of both plasmas on electron time scales .",
    "this rapid thermalization will cancel any significant proton acceleration by hot electrons already at the relatively low density of the ambient medium we have used .",
    "proton acceleration is , however , still possible because a thermal pressure gradient is provided by the density jump .",
    "most electrons merely follow after their thermalization the motion of the protons to conserve the quasi - neutrality of the plasma .",
    "they maintain their maxwellian velocity distribution , which would not be the case for an expansion into a vacuum @xcite .",
    "the protons at the front of the hot plasma are accelerated by the electric field of the double layer to about 5.5 times the proton thermal speed , while the maxwellian distribution is represented up to 3 - 4 times the proton thermal speed .",
    "the expansion of the protons from the hot into the cool plasma is dominated by the free streaming of the fastest protons ( diffusion ) .",
    "the effects of the ambient medium on the proton expansion are initially negligible .",
    "eventually the interaction of the expanding and the ambient plasma results in the formation of shocks .",
    "we have observed one shock at the position , where the protons of both plasmas merge .",
    "this shock did not result in the acceleration of electrons or in the modification of their phase space distribution .",
    "the protons of the hot plasma expand farther than the position of this shock and they can interact with the protons of the cool plasma through ion beam instabilities .",
    "the interval , in which the protons of both plasmas co - exist , resembles qualitatively the upstream region of an electrostatic shock @xcite .",
    "however , the density and the speed of the beam of expanding protons of the hot plasma are both higher than what we expect for a shock - reflected ion beam",
    ". we have observed in the simulation the growth of a phase space structure in the upstream proton distribution that gave rise to an electron phase space hole .",
    "the proton structure evolved into a second shock ahead of the primary one .",
