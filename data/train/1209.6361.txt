    "most implementations of thermoelectric devices utilize highly doped semiconductors with linear ( ohmic ) current - voltage characteristics . in such materials ,",
    "the thermoelectric efficiency is determined by the figure of merit @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath2 the electrical conductivity , @xmath3 the temperature , and @xmath4 the thermal conductivity .",
    "the @xmath5 factor has governed much of the research in developing approaches to improve thermoelectric efficiency ; however , the intimate relationship between transport quantities places constraints on the possible paths towards efficiency improvements .",
    "thus , new approaches where the thermoelectric efficiency does not depend on @xmath5 would open new routes for scientific exploration .",
    "an example of such an approach is thermionic cooling and power generation , which was originally considered for injection into vacuum@xcite , and then into semiconductors@xcite .",
    "these thermionic devices are often considered different from thermoelectric devices due to the presence of an injection barrier and because the channel length is shorter than the electronic mean - free path , giving ballistic electron transportnolas , ulrich , mahan2 . however , as the channel length increases beyond the mean - free path , thermionic devices become equivalent to thermoelectric devices@xcite , which has led to new proposals to engineer multilayer semiconductor materials@xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we explore an alternative approach that does not rely on ohmic transport or thermionic emission , but instead exploits space - charge - limited ( scl ) electronic transport in a semiconductor .",
    "we derive an expression for thermoelectric efficiency in this regime , and show that it depends on a new dimensionless figure of merit that replaces @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , we apply the theory to bulk , thin film , and nanowire materials , and conclude that nanowires are the most promising to harness scl transport for thermoelectrics .        the term `` space - charge - limited '' originated from the consideration of charge injection into a region where electronic transport is ballistic . in that case ,",
    "space - charge effects are detrimental because they create an additional barrier for injection compared with the reference space - charge - free system@xcite .",
    "this situation is relevant to _ thermionic _ devices where space - charge effects have been shown to reduce efficiency@xcite .",
    "the issue of space - charge is different if one considers semiconductor - based _ thermoelectric _ devices .",
    "there , the reference system is a highly - doped semiconductor with two ohmic contacts . in that case ,",
    "space - charge effects are minimal because the high doping immediately screens the injected charge . however ,",
    "if the doping in the semiconductor is lowered , space charge effects become dominant , and the current becomes larger than the ohmic current because electronic transport is no longer determined by the free - carrier relaxation time , but by the shorter carrier transit time@xcite .",
    "this situation , which has been observed experimentally in a broad range of materials , is the one that we consider in this manuscript .",
    "figure 1 shows the system under consideration : a low - doped semiconductor between two ohmic contacts .",
    "band diagrams are shown in figs 1a , b for the case relevant to electron injection : the metal fermi level contacts the semiconductor in the conduction band creating a large density of carriers in the near - interface region .",
    "band - bending away from the metal / semiconductor interface creates a barrier for electron injection at zero bias . under bias ,",
    "a maximum in the potential is created near the injecting electrode , defining the so - called `` virtual cathode''@xcite .",
    "modeling has demonstrated that in the presence of this virtual cathode , scl transport dominates as soon as the applied bias @xmath6 exceeds a few @xmath7@xcite .",
    "this leads to a current - voltage relationship @xmath8 as discussed further below .",
    "this relationship differs from the exponential @xmath9 characteristics usually considered for thermionic systems@xcite ; the transitions between the thermionic and scl regimes and the role of schottky barriers has been studied in detail@xcite , demonstrating that scl dominates even when small schottky barriers are present .",
    "to be specific , we consider the thermoelectric power generation efficiency of the system of fig . 1 ,",
    "but the approach should apply to cooling as well .",
    "the efficiency of a thermoelectric material for power generation is given by@xcite@xmath10where @xmath11 is the thermoelectric power generated , @xmath12 is the electrical power dissipated , and @xmath13 is the thermal power supplied .",
    "here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the cold and hot side temperatures and @xmath16 is the local potential .    usually , one considers a highly doped semiconductor of length @xmath17 between ohmic contacts . for a bias voltage @xmath6",
    ", there is a linear drop of the potential along the channel due to the free - carrier screening ; this leads to @xmath18 , giving @xmath19 and the dependence of the efficiency on @xmath5@xcite . for scl transport ,",
    "the transport equations need to be solved self - consistently with the poisson equation due to the unscreened space - charge@xcite ; in the simplest model with diffusive electronic transport@xcite , this gives an electrostatic potential that depends on position as @xmath20this nonlinear spatial dependence of the potential leads to the current - voltage relationship @xcite @xmath21thus , in the scl regime , the current is no longer linear in @xmath6 , but is quadratic instead .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath22 depends on the dimensionality of the material , and to some extent on the shape of the electrodes , as will be discussed further below .",
    "the quadratic form of the @xmath9 behavior implies that @xmath23 ; the interest in this transport regime for thermoelectrics is illustrated in fig . 1c , where @xmath12 for the ohmic and scl regimes are compared .",
    "there , @xmath24 in the scl regime is below that of the ohmic regime at sufficiently high voltage , suggesting a potentially new regime of operation for thermoelectrics .",
    "( the cross - over between ohmic and scl transport occurs at @xmath25 , as shown in the fig .",
    "this sets a condition for when ohmic contributions should be negligible compared to scl transport . )    to derive the thermoelectric efficiency in this regime , we utilize the approach described in ref . @xcite . from the above equations we obtain for the local efficiency    @xmath26    where we used @xmath27 , and where the prefactor @xmath28 indicates that the efficiency is limited by the carnot efficiency .",
    "the temperature @xmath3 depends on position through the heat equation@xcite@xmath29the first term on the right hand side is the usual thomson effect , while the second term is the local joule heating in the material @xmath30 .",
    "this equation applies for scl transport because both the electronic and phononic transport are diffusive , and thus both the electronic and phononic thermal conductivities are well defined ( this has been demonstrated for scl transport in nanowires@xcite ) .    the total efficiency of a segment is obtained from@xcite    @xmath31 .\\ ] ]    noticing that @xmath32/[st+\\kappa \\nabla t / j]$ ] and assuming that the coefficients are independent of temperature and position we arrive at    @xmath33    thus , the efficiency depends only on quantities evaluated at the cold and hot sides@xcite .",

    "since this is the current state - of - the - art in thermoelectric materials , we can use it as a comparison with the scl regime ; in that case one would need @xmath59 to achieve the same efficiency at this given @xmath51 .",

    "high @xmath39 requires large @xmath1 , low @xmath4 and large @xmath65 ; but it also needs large @xmath64 , a criterion not usually required for high @xmath74 .",
    "this arises because large @xmath64 serves to screen the injected charge , and reduces the repulsive coulomb interaction that opposes charge injection .",
    "this is beneficial because dielectric screening maintains the scl transport regime , in contrast to free - carrier screening that would make the current ohmic .",
    "two advantages of the scl regime are that the maximum values of @xmath1 and @xmath75 can be exploited .",
    "indeed , ohmic materials are usually operated at high doping where both @xmath1 and @xmath65 are reduced from their maximum values .",
    "but at low doping @xmath1 attains a maximum at a value@xcite @xmath76 while @xmath65 saturates to its intrinsic value @xmath77 .",
    "we can thus write the maximum value of @xmath39 as@xmath78where @xmath79 is a geometry - dependent factor that can be obtained from eq",

    "we note that the @xmath39 factor depends linearly on @xmath65 , just like an ohmic material where @xmath81 ; however , the difference is that the mobility in @xmath5 is the high - doping mobility , which is smaller than @xmath82 .",
    "to evaluate the practicality of the scl approach for thermoelectric power generation , we apply the theory to the bulk , thin film , and nanowire geometries for @xmath83 k and @xmath84 = 300k .",
    "we consider gaas at low doping as an example material since scl has been observed in this material@xcite , and because material properties are readily availableblakemore : at @xmath85 @xmath86k and low doping , @xmath871.35 ev , @xmath88 , @xmath89 @xmath90 , and @xmath91 30 w / mk .",

    "the case of thin films ( fig .",
    "4b ) is slightly more promising with larger efficiencies at longer lengths , but this requires small film thicknesses .",
    "also note that the large @xmath84 over the small lengths @xmath17 where reasonable efficiency is observed in fig . 4a and 4b would lead to very large heat fluxes that further limit the usefulness of these geometries . thus , for the bulk or thin film geometries to be useful",

    "scl currents are enhanced due to the scaling @xmath96 ; in fact , @xmath39 becomes independent of length , and scales as @xmath97 , with @xmath68 being naturally small for nanowires .",
    "this leads to a large efficiency which exceeds the 10% value for nanowires less than 20 nm in radius .",
    "this efficiency could be even larger if other effects predicted and measured for nanowires were included ; for example , from eq .",
    "@xmath98 , @xmath39 depends sensitively on the bandgap , which increases with decreasing diameter .",
