    "the structure of complex systems across various disciplines can be abstracted and conceptualized as complex networks of nodes and links to which many quantitative methods can be applied so as to extract any characteristics embedded in the system@xcite .",
    "there exist many types of networks and characterizing their topology is very important for a wide range of static and dynamic properties .",
    "recently , c. song _ _ et al.__@xcite applied a least box number covering algorithm to demonstrate the existence of self - similarity in many real networks .",
    "they also studied and compared several possible least box number covering algorithms , by applying them to a number of model and real - world networks@xcite .",
    "they found that the least box number covering optimization is equivalent to the well - known vertex coloring algorithm which is a np - hard problem .",
    "it implied that any least box number covering algorithms are heuristic algorithms .",
    "can we avoid the np - hard problem and simplify the network fractal dimension calculation ? in this paper we modify the random sequential box - covering algorithm@xcite and presented a random ball coverage algorithm .",
    "the relative error smallest upper bound ( supremum ) is given theoretically .",
    "the simulation experiments shows that no matter how large the network diameter is , this upper bound tends to @xmath1 .",
    "so we develop another algorithm for calculating dimension which employ only two random ball coverages .",
    "we also yield the smallest relative error upper bound of this algorithm , which tend to @xmath0 when the network diameter is large enough . in this point of view , for a proper acceptable error range , the random ball covering algorithm is equivalent to the least box number covering algorithm in statistic sense when a network is large enough .",
    "there is no need to focus on the least box number covering optimization problem when we want to calculate dimension of a large diameter network .",
    "the least box number coverage@xcite and random ball coverage were defined as following . for a given network @xmath2 ,",
    "a box with diameter @xmath3 is a set of nodes where all distances @xmath4 between any two nodes @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the box are smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "the least box number coverage is the box coverage with the minimum number of boxes required to cover the entire network @xmath2 . in order to correspond to the fractal network",
    "definition@xcite we use open ball to cover the network .",
    "so our random ball coverage is little difference with the random sequential box - covering algorithm@xcite .",
    "a ball with radius @xmath3 and center node @xmath7 is the set of nodes which satisfy the shortest path length from the center @xmath7 to each of them is smaller than @xmath3 . the random ball coverage with radius @xmath3 as : at each step",
    ", we randomly choose a node which has not been covered as a center , and cover all the nodes within the distance @xmath3 to the center .",
    "the process is repeated until all the nodes in the network were covered .",
    "theorem @xmath8 : @xmath9 @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of boxes in a lest box number coverage with diameter @xmath3 and @xmath12 denotes the number of balls in a random ball coverage with radius @xmath3 .",
    "proof :    @xmath13 can be regarded as the number of boxes in a random box number coverage with diameter @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15    suppose @xmath16 denote all the boxes in a lest box number coverage , where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "then we have @xmath19 for all @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes empty set .    according to the above definition of random ball coverage with radius @xmath3 , without loosing any generality",
    "suppose the center of the first ball in a random ball coverage process is @xmath22 , then @xmath23 is covered by the first ball and the second random ball s center must lies out of @xmath23 . without loosing any generality",
    "we also can assume @xmath24 is the center of the second ball , then @xmath25 is covered by the second ball .",
    "in this way , we can get that : @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath26    @xmath27 @xmath10    theorem @xmath28 : suppose @xmath2 is a fractal network , the available box diameter range is @xmath29 and we employ linear lest squares regression to get the dimension .",
    "then the smallest upper bound of the relative error of dimension calculated by random ball coverage is    @xmath30}{(r - m+1)\\sum_{i = m}^{r}{(\\log{i})^{2}}-(\\log\\frac{r!}{m!})^2}$ ]    where , @xmath31 and satisfy : @xmath32 proof :    @xmath33 network @xmath2 is fractal in range @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath34 there must exist a proper @xmath35 for any @xmath36 such that @xmath37 @xmath38    then @xmath39\\ ] ] where , @xmath40 is the dimension of the network .",
    "suppose @xmath41 @xmath42    @xmath43    then @xmath44    and @xmath45}{(r - m+1)\\sum_{i = m}^{r}{(\\log{i})^{2}}-(\\log\\frac{r!}{m!})^2}$ ]    @xmath34 the relative error is @xmath46}{(r - m+1)\\sum_{i = m}^{r}{(\\log{i})^{2}}-(\\log\\frac{r!}{m!})^2}$ ]    employing linear programming , the upper bound of the relative error    is:@xmath30}{(r - m+1)\\sum_{i = m}^{r}{(\\log{i})^{2}}-(\\log\\frac{r!}{m!})^2}$ ]    where , @xmath31 and satisfy : @xmath32 fig.[relative_error_plot ] show the relationship among @xmath47 .",
    "it is not easy to get any conclusion directly about the upper bound from the above expression .",
    "so we have done some numerical calculations .",
    "it seems that for a given @xmath48 when @xmath49 becomes large , it has a limit .",
    "for instance , when @xmath48=1 or 2 , its limit is about @xmath1 .",
    "it implies that no matter how large the network diameter is , the relative error never be lower than @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , we could only use two points @xmath50 and @xmath51 to estimate dimension @xmath40 which is named twice - random ball coverage algorithm .",
    "the corresponding upper bound of relative error will be tend to @xmath0 when the fractal network diameter tend to infinite .",
    "theorem @xmath52 : suppose @xmath2 is a fractal network , the available box diameter range is @xmath29 .",
    "we just use @xmath50 and @xmath51 to estimate network dimension",
    ". then the estimated dimension value is @xmath53 and the smallest relative error upper bound is @xmath54 .",
    "proof :    obviously , @xmath55 and    @xmath56 , then @xmath57    more details are shown in fig.[relative_error_plot ] .    employing random ball coverage algorithm ( twice - random ball coverage algorithm ) , we get the fractal dimension of the world - wide web is @xmath58 , @xmath59diameter , @xmath60 , which is corresponding to the dimension obtained by c. song _",
    "et al._(dimension is @xmath61)@xcite . from our empirical results ,",
    "we find for many networks , @xmath62diameter and @xmath63 is more reasonable .",
    "when @xmath63 we get www network dimension is @xmath64 .",
    "sometimes , the available box diameter @xmath49 is not sufficient enough , we can calculate @xmath12 many time and get the dimension .",
    "we also test this method in the @xmath65 cellular networks@xcite . for each network @xmath66=diameter , @xmath67 and each @xmath12 ,",
    "we perform random coverage @xmath68 times .",
    "then we get the average dimension of the whole cellular networks is @xmath69 which is perfect corresponding to the dimension obtained by c. song _",
    "et al._(dimension is @xmath70)@xcite and w. zhou _ et al . _",
    "( dimension is @xmath71)@xcite .",
    "because we calculate each @xmath72 times , for any one of the @xmath65 cellular networks , we can get @xmath68 different dimensions . for each cellular network",
    "we can get an average variance .",
    "the maximum average variance of @xmath65 cellular network dimensions is @xmath73 , the average variance @xmath74 .",
    "if we use the network dimension which is obtained by @xmath68 times calculation to substitute its real fractal dimension @xmath40 in our above discussion , we get the maximum relative error of @xmath68 time calculations of the @xmath65 cellular networks is @xmath75 .",
    "the average maximum relative error is @xmath76 and the average relative error is @xmath77 .",
    "the relative errors of empirical results are far less than the theoretical upper bounds respectively .",
    "the interesting thing is that , in our theoretical discussion , the upper bound of twice - random ball coverage is less than the upper bound of random ball coverage algorithm .",
    "but the empirical results always show the random ball coverage algorithm is better than twice - random ball coverage algorithm .",
    "so , we think the random ball coverage algorithm is better than twice - random ball coverage algorithm in practice .",
    "moreover , our theorems also can be used to estimate a network s diameter .",
    "denotes the diameter of a network , @xmath78 denote the relative errors of random ball coverage algorithm and twice - random ball coverage algorithm.,width=302 ]",
    "in this paper , we strictly present the upper bound of the relative error of random ball coverage method in fractal network dimension calculation .",
    "and we also yield a simple relative error upper bound @xmath54 of twice - random ball coverage method . for many real - world networks ,",
    "when the network diameter is sufficient enough this kind of relative error upper bound will tend to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , if the network is sufficient enough , twice - random ball coverage is equivalent to the leat box number coverage in fractal dimension calculation and calculating fractal network dimension is not a np - hard problem . for the networks which is",
    "not sufficient enough , we can calculate random ball number many times and get the dimension , which is also very effective and accuracy .",
    "the above discussions can lead another problem naturally .",
    "we also can define random full box coverage .",
    "a full box with diameter @xmath3 is a set of nodes , such that any other nodes out of the box is added to the box will make the box diameter larger or equal to @xmath3 .",
    "the random full box coverage algorithm with diameter @xmath3 can be defined as@xcite : at each step we randomly choose a uncovered node @xmath79 as the first node of the box , and select the uncovered nodes to the box until the box become full .",
    "we guess the random full box coverage algorithm is equivalent to the least box number covering algorithm in statistic sense . in the future",
    "we will do some deep researches about this problem .",
