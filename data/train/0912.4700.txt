    "thermopower , @xmath1 , is an important transport coefficient that offers valuable information about the electronic structure , the scattering processes and the mechanisms of carrier - phonon coupling in a system . in the last few years",
    "there has been growing experimental interest in @xmath1 of single wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) .",
    "several groups have reported thermopower measurements on bulk swcnt materials ( e.g. , mats , fibers , films ) @xcite and on individual swcnts  @xcite .",
    "however , only modest progress has been made up to now in understanding the unique features of @xmath1 in these systems .",
    "interesting issues concerning the large positive thermopower ( @xmath2 80  @xmath3v / k ) in pristine samples @xcite , the change of sign of @xmath1 upon exposure to oxygen  @xcite and the effect of carrier - phonon coupling @xcite on @xmath1 still remain open .",
    "@xmath1 consists of two additive contributions which are diffusion , @xmath4 , and phonon - drag , @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath4 is due to the carrier diffusion in the presence of a temperature gradient and for degenerate systems varies linearly with @xmath5 according to mott s expression .",
    "@xmath0 originates from the interchange of momentum between acoustic phonons and carriers via the carrier - phonon interaction .",
    "the first theoretical models for the study of the phonon drag in metals  @xcite and semiconductors  @xcite were developed half a century ago .",
    "more recently , extensive theoretical and experimental work has been carried out on @xmath0 of low - dimensional semiconductor structures  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on @xmath1 in p - doped swcnt films and fibers  @xcite provided clear evidence for the presence of @xmath0 at @xmath6  k. on the theory level , however , there is still an ongoing discussion about the role of @xmath0 in measured thermopower  @xcite .",
    "so far , the theoretical studies of @xmath0 are confined to metallic armchair ( 10,10 ) tubes  @xcite . however , in perfect metallic tubes with mirror electron - hole symmetry both @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath0  @xcite are expected to be negligibly small compared to the experimental data , due to the competition between the opposite contributions of electrons and holes .",
    "we note that the accuracy of the existing theoretical models  @xcite for @xmath0 in metallic tubes has been questioned recently by mahan  @xcite . also , a recent theoretical work  @xcite pointed out that thermopower vanishes in one - dimensional conductors with a linear energy dispersion ( as in the case of metallic tubes ) due to electron - hole symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we propose a theoretical model for the phonon - drag thermopower in semiconducting swcnts that are characterized by a non - linear energy dispersion .",
    "( a brief discussion on the behavior of @xmath0 in this kind of nanotubes appears in [ ] . )",
    "we suggest that the measured thermopower in doped samples is due to the contribution of degenerate semiconducting nanotubes . in our model",
    "@xmath0 originates from carrier - phonon intraband scattering within the first 1d subband . as we discuss below , the dominant contribution to @xmath0",
    "is made by long - wavelength acoustic phonons that backscatter carriers across the fermi surface . in this case",
    "the carrier - phonon coupling is much weaker in metallic tubes than in semiconducting tubes  @xcite and , consequently , @xmath0 is expected to be substantially larger in the latter ones .",
    "we note that upon chemical or electrostatic doping the fermi level can be pushed into the conduction or valence band and the degenerate semiconducting tubes can be considered as one - dimensional metals .",
    "therefore the terms metallicand semiconductingrefer only to the different electronic structure in the two types of tubes ( see , for example , ref .",
    "there are two equivalent theoretical approaches to the problem of phonon drag@xcite . in the first approach phonons",
    "are perturbed in the presence of a weak temperature gradient @xmath7 .",
    "non - equilibrium phonons transfer part of their momentum to carriers due to the carrier - phonon coupling . then the phonon - drag contribution to the thermoelectric current @xmath8 is calculated by solving the coupled boltzmann equations for carriers and acoustic phonons @xcite .",
    "the phonon - drag thermopower is readily obtained by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the carrier conductivity . in the second approach carriers",
    "are accelerated isothermally in the presence of a weak electric field @xmath11 and impart some of their momentum to phonons due to the carrier - phonon coupling .",
    "then the resulting phonon heat current and the phonon - drag contribution to the peltier coefficient is calculated @xcite .",
    "this method of evaluating @xmath0 is referred as @xmath12-approach  @xcite because it provides a direct estimation of the peltier coefficient .",
    "the equivalence of the above two approaches is secured by onsager s symmetry relation . in this paper",
    "we follow the second approach which is more general and it can be applied even in systems where carriers do not behave semiclassically  @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce the theoretical model for the calculation of @xmath0 in the semiclassical transport regime . an explicit expression for @xmath0",
    "is derived in sec.iib and in sec.iic we derive a simple approximate expression for @xmath0 for the case of a highly degenerate semiconducting tube . numerical results for @xmath0 as a function of temperature , tube radius and position of fermi level are presented in sec.iii . in the same section",
    "we discuss the effect of screening . in sec.iv",
    "we compare our theory with available experimental data for acid - doped bulk swcnt samples .",

    "then , the carrier energy is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the carrier effective mass and @xmath24 denotes the position of the first van hove singularity .    in carbon",
    "nanotubes phonons also exhibit 1d character .",

    "where , @xmath26 is the polarization vector , @xmath27 is the phonon wave vector in the axial direction and @xmath28 denotes the phonon modes associated with phonon confinement along the circumference . due to the conservation of angular momentum only the three low - energy acoustic modes with @xmath29 ( the so - called twisting , stretching and breathing modes ) contribute to the carrier - phonon intraband scattering .",
    "the phonon frequencies and polarization vectors have been calculated within the continuum model proposed by suzuura and ando @xcite .",
    "the carrier - phonon interaction in carbon nanotubes has been studied in several texts within the tight - binding approximation  @xcite or a continuous elastic theory  @xcite . here",
    "we follow the continuous model of suzuura and ando @xcite according to which the carrier - phonon coupling is described via the acoustic deformation potential @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the deformation potential constant .",
    "the deformation potential approximation provides a good description of the carrier interaction with long - wavelength acoustic phonons . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) accounts for the nonzero curvature of the nanotube @xcite .",
    "the twisting mode does not participate to carrier - phonon scattering via the deformation potential coupling .",
    "moreover , in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath32 ) , which is the regime of our interest , the breathing mode is dispersionless and does not contribute to @xmath0 .",

    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "we assume a small electric field @xmath40 in the axial direction of the nanotube .",
    "the presence of @xmath40 creates a net flux of carriers along the axis of the tube which results in a momentum transfer to phonons through the carrier - phonon coupling .",
    "we calculate the resulting phonon heat flux @xmath41 and obtain the phonon - drag contribution to the transport coefficient @xmath42 to get @xmath0 we utilize the onsager s",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     concerning the consistency of the fitting parameters @xmath165 and @xmath126 we should make the following remarks . by using the values for @xmath126 shown in table i and a simple tight binding model for the estimation of the first van hove singularity ( see , for example , ref .  [ ] ) the values we get for @xmath21 are in good agreement with those determined from reflectivity and raman measurements  @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath165 varies inversely with @xmath180 in agreement with mott s expression for @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the values we extract for @xmath126 support recent arguments according to which h@xmath174so@xmath175 is a stronger dopant than hno@xmath162 @xcite .",
    "namely , according to our estimation for the fermi wave numbers , the fermi level is shifted by 94 and 155  mev below the top of the valence band for the plv+hno@xmath162 and hipco+h@xmath174so@xmath175 samples , respectively .    in order to show clearly the effect of phonon drag in fig.6 we have plotted the ratio @xmath176 as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the circles and the squares are the measured values for the samples plv+hno@xmath162 and hipco+h@xmath174so@xmath175 , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines are the theoretical estimates for @xmath0 and the solid lines are the calculated values for the total thermopower .",
    "the peaks at @xmath181 are associated to phonon - drag thermopower .",
    "the shift between the experimental and the theoretical values for @xmath182 is due to the logarithmic term in @xmath4 .",
    "the position of the peak moves towards to higher temperatures as doping increases .",
    "this dependence can be understood by maximizing the ratio @xmath183 using eq .",
    "( [ appr1 ] )",
    ". then we get the following dependence @xmath184    it is important to add that the exponential suppression of @xmath0 at low temperatures is unique for 1d systems . in higher dimensions",
    "@xmath0 exhibits a power - law @xmath5 dependence at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the observed peak in @xmath176 , which is ascribed to phonon drag , underlies the 1d character of thermopower .",
    "this adds another confirmation that thermopower in bulk carbon nanotube - based materials is a property of the individual tube rather than a property of the network .",
    "in summary , we have presented a rigorous model for the calculation of the phonon - drag thermopower in degenerately doped semiconducting swcnts . by using the derived model we investigated the dependence of @xmath0 on temperature , tube radius and position of the fermi level .",
    "we found that @xmath0 decreases with the increase of the tube radius following approximately a @xmath161 law at high temperatures . in the degenerate limit",
    ", we derive a simple expression for @xmath0 which can be used as a probe for the estimation of the free carrier density in doped tubes .",
    "according to this expression @xmath0 shows an activated @xmath5 dependence at low temperatures .",
    "screening effects of the carrier - phonon coupling reduce the magnitude of @xmath0 severely and result to a quasi - linear @xmath5-dependence of phonon drag at high @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we have compared our model with available data in acid - doped bulk samples  @xcite and we found a very good agreement in a wide temperature range .",
