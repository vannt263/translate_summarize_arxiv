    "since the first achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in atomic gases , techniques for the production of quantum degenerate gases ( qdgs ) from laser cooled atoms have been continually improved , refined and simplified . because the phase space density achievable with laser cooling is limited by light - induced , density - dependent collisional losses and by the temperature limits of laser cooling , qdgs are typically made in a two step process .",
    "the only exception to this is sr which has been directly laser cooled to degeneracy @xcite .",
    "after laser cooling , the ensemble is transferred into a conservative potential formed by an off - resonant magnetic or optical field and forced evaporative cooling is performed to achieve the requisite temperatures and densities .",
    "efficient evaporative cooling relies on rapid thermalization of the atoms in the trap and requires that the evaporation time be shorter than the lifetime of a particle in the trap .",
    "since the speed of evaporation is limited by the elastic collision rate , @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the atomic density , @xmath2 is the elastic collision cross section , and @xmath3 is the average collision velocity ) , this requirement places simultaneous constraints on the minimum initial atom number loaded into the conservative trap and on the quality of the vacuum system because the density of room - temperature , background - gas particles sets an upper bound on the trap lifetime .",
    "these two constraints are in conflict since the atom number available for the initial stage of laser cooling is proportional to the partial pressure of those atoms , and it is the presence of this atomic vapor that also ultimately limits the trap lifetime . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that these requirements can be met for the production of qdgs of lithium by a magneto - optic trap loaded from a simple effusive atomic source .",
    "this apparatus does not require a separated cold atom source such as a zeeman slower @xcite or a 2d mot @xcite or an additional 3d mot from which the atoms are transferred @xcite .",
    "nor does it require any separation or differential pumping between the effusive atom source and the science chamber .",
    "the result is a small and inexpensive vacuum system ideal for miniaturization .",
    "we fully characterize our system and demonstrate with it the production of a mbec , and we use it to observe evidence of the pairing gap in a strongly interacting two - component dfg in the bec - bcs crossover regime .",

    "[ fig : ovencurrentdata ] shows the behavior of this oven loaded lithium mot at a field gradient of 35  g@xmath5 .",
    "the loading rate ( @xmath6 ) , the lifetime or inverse loss rate ( @xmath7 ) of both the mot and odt , and the steady state atom number ( @xmath8 ) in the mot are shown as a function of the oven temperature .",
    "these parameters were determined by fitting the loading curve of the mot to the solution , @xmath9 of the differential equation @xmath10 .",
    "the steady state number is then the product of the loading and inverse loss rates , @xmath11 .",
    "this model does not include a two - body loss term to model particle loss due to light assisted collisions between cold atoms within the mot , and therefore the loss term we report is an overestimate of the mot losses due only to collisions with the residual background vapor or atoms from the hot atomic beam .",
    "in addition , because the li  li@xmath12 collision cross section ( with one atom in the excited state ) is much larger than for ground state collisions , the loss rate for the excited state atoms in the mot will be significantly larger due to collisions with fast moving li atoms in the atomic beam .",
    "these two effects make the mot lifetime only an estimate of the expected lifetime for the ensemble in the @xmath13 .    for comparison , the inverse loss rate ( i.e.  lifetime ) of a 50  @xmath14k deep @xmath13",
    "is also provided for a few of the oven current settings .",
    "since the mot is significantly deeper than the @xmath13 , the mot trap loss rate due to background vapor collisions is expected to be smaller @xcite .",
    "in addition , residual losses from the @xmath13 will occur due to spontaneous emission and evaporation losses .",
    "thus the lifetime in a shallow @xmath13 will always be an overestimate of the total background collision rate .    at low oven current settings where the loss rate is dominated by collisions with atoms or molecules other than li atoms ,",
    "the mot lifetime is , as expected , much larger than the lifetime in the @xmath13 . whereas at high oven current settings where the loss rate is primarily determined by the collisions with fast moving atoms in the li atomic beam , the mot lifetime is similar to the @xmath13 lifetime .",
    "the longest inverse loss rate measured for the @xmath13 was on the order of 40  s ( at an oven current of 8  a and a temperature of 550  k ) corresponding to a background vapor pressure of approximately @xmath15  torr @xcite .",
    "as the temperature of the oven increases so does the captured flux and the loss rate . at a current of @xmath16 ( corresponding to an oven temperature of 680  k ) ,",
    "the steady state atom number is maximized .",
    "there exists a clear tradeoff between the inverse loss rate of the lithium mot and the steady state atom number , and by running the oven at 625  k ( with @xmath17 ) instead of 680  k , the inverse loss rate can be increased by more than a factor of four with only a factor of two reduction in the trapped number .",
    "we note that the mot performance is similar to that previously reported in ref .",
    "the primary difference is that here the oven aperture is 30% larger and a portion of the mot light is sent counter propagating to the oven flux .",
    "this additional slowing beam enhances the loading rate by a factor of two .      in this experiment , a high power but broad linewidth laser creates an optical dipole trap ( 200 w total power ) that is loaded from the mot .",
    "a large power and small beam waist is necessary to achieve a 3.5  mk odt depth required to capture the atoms from the mot .",
    "the atoms are then transferred to a shallow , narrow linewidth , low power @xmath13 ( 18  w total power ) .",
    "this is done because an eventual goal is to confine the atoms in a 1d optical lattice formed by the narrow linewidth odt .",
    "however , we note that this procedure is not optimal in terms of the final atom number at degeneracy since the transfer between the odts is only 25% efficient .",

    "total power is turned on and , in less than 10  ms , up to 10% of the @xmath20li atoms are transferred into the @xmath13 .",
    "fine adjustments of the mot position to optimize its overlap with the @xmath13 are essential to achieving efficient transfer and are made by adding a small ( 5 to 10  g ) homogeneous magnetic field that shifts the magnetic quadrupole center during the compression phase .",
    "this field is generated by three pairs of large ( 30  cm diameter )  compensation \" coils for independent control of the field along each of the three orthogonal spatial axes .",
    "we observe extremely rapid trap losses ( with trap lifetimes on the order of a few ms ) due to light assisted collisions and hyperfine relaxation , and we therefore optically pump to the lower hyperfine state ( @xmath21 ) during the transfer by extinguishing the repump light 400  @xmath14s before the pump light .",
    "this procedure produces an almost equal population of the two sub - levels of the lower hyperfine state : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the light for the @xmath13 is derived from a multi - longitudinal mode , 100  w fiber laser ( spi lasers , sp-100c-0013 ) operating at 1090 nm with a spectral width exceeding 1 nm . the @xmath13 is comprised of two nearly co - propagating beams crossing at an angle of 14@xmath24 .",
    "each beam has a maximum power of 100  w ( for a total power of 200 w achieved by recycling the first beam ) and is focused to a waist ( @xmath25 intensity radius ) of @xmath26  @xmath14 m and @xmath27  @xmath14 m . after the mot light is extinguished ,",
    "the @xmath13 beam power is ramped down linearly in time to 100 w total ( 50 w per beam ) in 100  ms while applying a homogenous magnetic field of 300  g produced by the same coils used to generate the quadrupole magnetic field for the mot .",
    "the output power of this spi laser is varied by an analog input controlling the pump diode current of the post amplifier stage .",
    "rapid thermalization occurs because of the large collision rate between the @xmath28 and @xmath29 states at 300  g @xcite . at the end of this forced evaporation stage , there are approximately @xmath30 atoms remaining at a temperature of @xmath31  @xmath14k ( verified by a time - of - flight expansion measurement ) .",
    "we observe thermal lensing effects which produce beam aberrations of our high power @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , we observe the position of the beam waists of the @xmath13 arms moving at approximately 780  @xmath14 m  s@xmath32 when the high power @xmath13 is initially turned on with 100  w per beam.m in the first 500  ms and 280  @xmath14 m in the next 500  ms due to thermal lensing ] these thermal effects were worse with a vacuum cell made from borosilicate glass .",
    "for this reason , we are now using a quartz cell . not only does quartz have a higher transmission in the near ir ( e.g.  at 1090 nm ) , but the thermal expansion coefficient of quartz is ten times smaller than that of borosilicate glass .",
    "at the end of the pre - evaporation stage the atoms are transferred into a lower - power @xmath13 whose intersection is aligned to the crossing of the high - power @xmath13 .",
    "the light for this second @xmath13 is generated by a single frequency , narrow - linewidth ( @xmath33 khz ) , 20 w fiber laser operating at 1064  nm ( ipg photonics ylr-20 - 1064-lp - sf ) .",
    "this transfer is done to avoid ensemble heating observed in the spi laser @xmath13 and allows further forced evaporative cooling to much lower powers and thus ensemble temperatures .",
    "in addition , as mentioned already , this narrow line - width laser trap can be used to realize an optical lattice .",
    "the disadvantage of this step is that the transfer is not yet well optimized and we only retain 25% of the atoms .",
    "further optimization of this transfer stage by aligning the trapping beams to be co - linear ( in order to increase the spatial overlap of the trapping potentials due to each laser ) is expected to produce significant improvement in the final atom number at the transition to quantum degeneracy .",
    "the ipg @xmath13 is comprised of two beams in the horizontal plane and crossing at an angle of 60@xmath24 and with a total power of 18  w ( 9  w per beam ) .",
    "the beams are focused to a waist ( @xmath25 intensity radius ) of @xmath34  @xmath14 m and @xmath35  @xmath14 m .",
    "the polarization of the two beams ( which have the same frequency ) is chosen to lie in the horizontal plane to minimize reflections at the cell ( the cell is uncoated but the beams enter the cell close to brewster s angle ) .",
    "unexpected heating and loss was observed when the polarization of the second beam was fixed perpendicular to the first ( i.e.  perpendicular to the horizontal plane and parallel to the magnetic field axis ) .",
    "the ipg @xmath13 beam power is controlled by a water cooled aom ( intraaction atd-1153da6 m ) .",
    "the diffraction efficiency of the aom is 60% . due to the experimental constraints",
    "the polarization of the ipg @xmath13 is perpendicular to the polarization that , according to the manufacturer of the aom , would lead to the diffraction efficiency of 75% .",
    "after the transfer of atoms into the ipg @xmath13 further evaporation is done at a field specific to a given experiment ( below @xmath36 to create molecules and above @xmath36 to create a strongly interacting fermi gas ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that the power of the ipg laser is not actively stabilized .",
    "over the past decade , quantum degenerate fermi gases of either @xmath37li or @xmath38k atoms have enabled the experimental study of the so - called bardeen - cooper - schrieffer  bose - einstein condensation crossover physics ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the following , we present data obtained with this apparatus showing evidence of both bose einstein condensation of molecules and pairing in a strongly - interacting , degenerate fermi gas .",
