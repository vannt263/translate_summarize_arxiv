    "in general , higher energy levels , having more extended wave functions , undergo larger broadening at a given flux value .",
    "conversely , bands become narrower with increasing field , as their wave functions become more spatially localized , tending to landau levels in the limit of high field intensities . in the tb model , the main effect of increasing the second- and third - nearest neighbor hoppings is a distortion of the butterfly that opens a gap at flux strengths of @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , indicated by the vertical ( red ) dotted lines in the butterflies in fig .",

    "the gap widens for higher - energy bands , consistent with the tb approximation , where such bands need to be modeled by larger hopping integrals to more distant neighbors .",
    "the gap decreases again with increasing field due to the stronger localization of the wave functions , an effect that is not included in the tb description with @xmath56-independent hopping .",
    "band crossings , which are not described within the single - band peierls approximation , are an interesting subject for future studies : the narrow third fd band seems to disrupt the butterfly pattern of the broader bands it crosses in regions ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) , but does not seem to exert any noticeable effect in region ( 9 ) . at higher energies [ see region ( 10 ) ] , where multiple bands cross , the resulting fractal spectrum can assume a form that is very different from the original hofstadter butterfly .",

    "the intermediate stages of this evolution are not accessible to the approximate methodologies hitherto employed .",
    "we use the square lattice potential with the parameters given in eq .  , but change the well depth  @xmath57 .",
    "we start with a very shallow potential ( @xmath58 ) , which corresponds to a landau - like system with nearly - free electrons in a magnetic field . the resulting spectrum is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sbatmovie]a ) ; it exhibits the typical `` landau fan '' form , with slightly broadened landau levels ( lls ) that display an internal fractal structure of minigaps ( most evident in the lowest level , @xmath59 ) .",
    "the hall conductance between lls increases monotonically in steps of @xmath49 , consistently with the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "furthermore , an emerging white gap ( @xmath60 ) can be observed at low field ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) . when the potential modulation is increased to @xmath63 [ fig .",
    "( [ fig : sbatmovie]b ) ] this gap is seen to widen further , practically cutting off a low - energy triangular section ( marked `` t '' in the figure ) from all lls @xmath64 with @xmath65 . at @xmath66",
    "the upper - right tip of this triangular cluster of states retains a tenuous link to the broadened @xmath67 landau band , at the position indicated by the blue arrow . at the same time , the minigaps at @xmath68 in the lowest landau band @xmath59 have broadened further , to the point where the band is only held together by a narrow sub - band at @xmath66 , indicated by the red arrow .",
    "the hall conductance in the gap between @xmath59 and @xmath67 at @xmath69 is still @xmath70 .",
    "but upon further increasing the modulation strength , the gap first closes and then reopens with the above links reversed : at @xmath71 [ fig .",
    "( [ fig : sbatmovie]c ) ] , the tip of the triangular cluster is now connected to the lowest miniband of @xmath59 ( blue arrow ) , while the rest of the @xmath59 miniband is connected to @xmath67 ( red arrow ) .",
    "at the same time , the gap has changed its character to @xmath60 , resulting in the first clearly discernible fd - like band @xmath72 , separated from all higher energy states by an unbroken white gap .",
    "most of @xmath72 is formed from the lowest miniband of the ll @xmath59 , except for the triangular cluster of states in @xmath73 , which originates from higher lls . the process of formation of the first fd band ( @xmath72 ) that is incipient at @xmath74 in fig .",

    "( [ fig : sbatmovie]d ) ] .",
    "the gradual transformation from lls to fd - like bands thus proceeds by the re - connection of minibands from one broadened ll to those of neighboring lls .",
    "this rearrangement process fragments the large triangular gaps between lls in the weak potential limit into minigaps encapsulated by the emerging fd - like bands . as a result , the fd states @xmath72 , @xmath76 , @xmath78 in fig",
    ".  [ fig : sbatmovie]d are composed of a low - field section that originates from higher lls ( triangle t in case of @xmath72 , one hofstadter butterfly segment plus a triangular cluster in case of @xmath76 , etc . ) , and a high - field section that is one miniband of the lowest ll @xmath59 .",
    "the above results show that with the method presented here it is possible to perform exact calculations of the spectrum of independent electrons in a 2d  periodic potential and constant perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the same technique is readily applicable to solve the kohn - sham equations of density functional theory  ( dft ) which are expected to provide a reasonable description at least for weakly correlated electron systems .",
    "experimental techniques have recently become available to directly probe the local dos in 2degs on surfaces in a perpendicular magnetic field using scanning tunneling spectroscopy , making possible the detection of spatial features of some lls  @xcite , and even measuring their response to a 1d  periodic potential due to surface buckling  @xcite .",
    "such developments may presently bring about additional possibilities of experimentally determining the spectral features of the 2deg subject simultaneously to a periodic potential and a perpendicular magnetic field , contrasting them with the predictions reported herein .",
    "the hofstadter butterfly is not unique to the system discussed here .",
    "the basic principle underlying the fractal energy spectrum is the presence of two competing symmetries ( in the case studied here , the periodicity of the lattice and the symmetry of the landau orbits , which is governed by the area required by one magnetic flux quantum ) .",
    "similar patterns have been observed or predicted to occur in a variety of very different systems , such as microwaves transmitted through a waveguide with a periodic arrangement of scatterers  @xcite , the electronic  @xcite and vibrational  @xcite spectra of incommensurate crystals , ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , and photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "the topological protection of the quantum hall phase has been shown to improve the performance of optical delay lines and to overcome limitations related to disorder in photonic technologies @xcite .",
    "we hope that the method presented here will also prove beneficial in these related fields .",

    "<S> the problem of two - dimensional , independent electrons subject to a periodic potential and a uniform perpendicular magnetic field unveils surprisingly rich physics , as epitomized by the fractal energy spectrum known as hofstadter s butterfly . </S>",

    "<S> we then go on to analyze the evolution of the fractal spectrum from a landau - like nearly - free electron system to the hofstadter tight - binding limit by tuning the amplitude of the modulation potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the motion of electrons in a crystalline solid subject to a magnetic field has been considered since the early days of quantum mechanics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the field splits the crystal s electronic bands into sub - bands and internal minigaps ; the energetic arrangement of these sub - bands forms a fractal structure reminiscent of a butterfly when plotted as a function of the field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> significant experimental effort has been devoted to detecting signatures of this energy spectrum in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs )  @xcite . for independent electrons , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is described by the single - particle schrdinger equation , @xmath0 \\psi({\\mathbf{r } } ) = e \\psi({\\mathbf{r}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian , @xmath2 is an eigenstate with energy @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the dynamical momentum operator and @xmath5 is the vector potential corresponding to the magnetic field , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we take the field to be uniform and oriented along the @xmath7-direction , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons are restricted to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath9-plane , and the external potential @xmath10 is periodic on a bravais lattice defined by vectors @xmath11 to date , this problem has been chiefly approached by approximations starting from two complementary limits , considering either the influence of a weak magnetic field on the band structure resulting from a strongly varying potential @xmath12 @xcite , or the influence of a small modulation potential on the landau - quantized electrons in a strong field @xcite . in the strong potential limit , </S>",
    "<S> one typically starts with a tight - binding ( tb ) approximation for a single band of the zero - field ( @xmath13 ) problem , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the crystal momentum . </S>",
    "<S> then , an effective hamiltonian for the magnetic field problem is generated from @xmath14 through the peierls substitution @xmath16  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure was used , among others , by hofstadter in his seminal article for a nearest - neighbor ( nn ) tb model of the 2d square lattice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of simplifications inherent to this approach : ( i ) the tb approximation of the zero - field band structure , ( ii ) the restriction to electrons in a single band , ( iii ) the neglect of the diamagnetic energy of the tb orbitals and the field dependence of the tb hopping integrals . </S>",
    "<S> this has been shown to lead to quantitative as well as qualitative errors for both nearly free and tightly bound two - dimensional electrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generalization of the effective hamiltonian approach has turned out to be difficult , see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the strong field approach is closely related to the strong potential one : if potential - induced coupling between different landau levels is neglected , the same secular equation results , but with the magnetic field replaced by its inverse @xcite . including such coupling has a profound effect on the calculated energy spectrum @xcite , even for weak coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting rearrangement of the hofstadter butterfly has recently been confirmed by experiments @xcite ; we take this as a strong indication that experiments can only be fully understood by going beyond the approximate schemes described above . </S>"
