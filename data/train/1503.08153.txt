    "in spite of its apparently limited scope the study of the electroweak corrections ( ewc ) has played a crucial role in three different directions :    * provide evidence for the consistency at the quantum level of the gauge and the higgs sectors of the standard model ( sm ) ; * give significant information , although indirect , on the existence and the mass of the top quark and the higgs boson before their direct discovery ; * constrain and orient the search for possible new physics beyond the sm .",
    "although not making justice to important earlier works on the subject , in order to recall the progressive role of the ewc it makes sense , as we do in the following , to set the @xmath0 time in 1971 , when t hooft proved the renormalizability of the electroweak sector of the sm@xcite . since then , this means more than forty years of progress until the discovery of the higgs boson , which offers new opportunities for precision physics .",
    "a few papers of veltman in 1977 played a key role both in establishing the program of computing the ewc to physical observables in the sm and in pointing out their possible sensitivity to physics in the 100 gev range or above , even by measurements of lower energy processes@xcite .",
    "the relevant physical observables are determined at tree level by three parameters : the two gauge couplings in the electroweak sector , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the vacuum expectation value of the higgs boson doublet @xmath3 . to fix these parameters ,",
    "three basic observables may be chosen , which is equivalent to a renormalization procedure . since the beginning of the electroweak correction program ,",
    "two such observables have emerged : the electromagnetic fine structure constant , @xmath4 , as measured by the josephson effect or the electron @xmath5 , and the fermi constant , @xmath6 , as determined from the muon lifetime . in the seventies",
    "the third observable was more often coming from the @xmath7-@xmath8 or the @xmath7-hadron cross sections , in particular the ratio @xmath9 between the neutral and the charged current processes , with a determination , at that time , of the weak mixing angle @xmath10 at about @xmath11 level . the emergence from @xmath12 and @xmath13 processes of a @xmath14 parameter close to unity , as predicted at tree level by the sm , was recognized by veltman as evidence for the isodoublet nature of the higgs boson and later , more generally , as a consequence of an approximate _ custodial symmetry_@xcite . at the same time",
    "the finding of @xmath14 close to unity motivated to establish the ewc program .",
    "the absence of any other precisely measured observable , as the same relatively large error on @xmath10 itself from neutrino scattering , could not allow any significant quantitative comparison with the ewc . yet , as already mentioned , the sensitivity to heavy non - decoupled particles was identified and relevant one loop effects calculated both due to a split fermion doublet or to the higgs boson . a first calculated one loop effect was the correction to the @xmath14-parameter , the ratio @xmath15 between the neutral - current fermi constant @xmath16 , defined in analogy with @xmath6 from the elastic electron - neutrino scattering amplitude at @xmath17 , and the charged - current fermi constant itself .",
    "the deviation from unity of @xmath14 was calculated from a charged lepton of mass @xmath18 , split from a massless neutrino in the same isodoublet@xcite @xmath19 this is the same correction as for a heavy top , of mass @xmath20 , and a quasi massless bottom up to the extra colour factor of @xmath21 that has to be introduced .",
    "the neutrino data mentioned above allowed to set an upper bound on @xmath22 of 800 gev , or - knowing now that the top is also heavy - of about 450 gev on the top mass .    somewhat later came the calculation in the sm of the two independent one loop corrections growing like the logarithm of the higgs mass , @xmath23@xcite .",
    "as recalled later on , these corrections affect in a precisely defined way every observable .",
    "for example one has @xmath24 @xmath25 veltman called `` screening theorem '' the observation of the mild logarithmic dependence on the higgs mass , taken much larger than @xmath26 , of all the one loop corrections .",
    "the root of this theorem is in the absence in the unitary gauge of any coupling of the w and the z to the higgs boson proportional to the quartic higgs coupling @xmath27 .",
    "although clear evidence for the ewc had to wait for the @xmath29 data at the z - pole , new more precise measurements came in the eighties from various sources : the direct measurements of the w and z masses at hadron colliders , @xmath7-@xmath30 and @xmath7-hadron scattering , atomic parity violation and @xmath29 collisions at various energies below the z - boson mass .",
    "this quickly led the focus on the constraints that could be inferred from these data on the top quark mass and , at least indirectly , on the higgs boson mass , which was rapidly recognized as relevant to the constraint on the top mass itself . at the summer conferences in 1989 , with the lep operation",
    "just about to start , it was possible to quote the following allowed ranges for the top mass@xcite : @xmath31 @xmath32 the fit leading to these constraints had already incorporated as well the fresh first measurement of the z mass by slc , @xmath33 gev , close to _ per mille _ precision@xcite . at the same summer conferences",
    "ua1 , ua2@xcite and cdf@xcite were quoting lower bounds on the top mass in the @xmath34 gev range .    with the same motivations in mind several calculations",
    "were also made , among which : i ) the one loop heavy - top correction to the @xmath35 coupling@xcite @xmath36 ii ) the two loop heavy - top corrections to the @xmath14-parameter@xcite and iii ) the corrections , again to the @xmath14-parameter , growing linearly with @xmath37 and occurring at two loops@xcite .",
    "a comprehensive and efficient calculation of all these effects was made possible by the observation that they come from the so called _ gaugeless limit _ of the sm , through a loop expansion controlled only by the top yukawa coupling , @xmath38 , and by the quartic higgs boson coupling , but they also have nothing to do with the gauging of the electroweak interactions and , as such , are relatively simple to calculate.]@xcite . as an example the corrections to the previously defined quantities , the only ones that grow like powers of @xmath39 , take a simple form up to two loop order @xmath40 @xmath41 these equations hold for @xmath42 , but simple closed forms can be given for any value of @xmath23 and @xmath28 . to get these corrections the w and",
    "the z bosons only enter in loops through their goldstone boson components with couplings controlled by @xmath38 and @xmath27 .",
    "similarly observables with w and z bosons as external legs are immediately related , via simple ward identities , to amplitudes for the corresponding goldstone bosons .",
    "these and other two loop calculations@xcite , quickly incorporated in programs like zfitter , topaz0 or similar , made possible a comparison at the _ per mille _ level of the sm with a number of precision observables measured at the z pole in the early nineties .",
    "consequently the constraint on the top mass became increasingly precise .",
    "in the winter conferences of 1994 an indirect determination of the top mass was quoted as@xcite @xmath43 with the second error due to the higgs mass scanning the @xmath44 gev range .",
    "alternatively one had @xmath45 these numbers can be compared with the value of @xmath46 in the cdf paper , published a few months later , that provided the first evidence for direct @xmath47 production@xcite .    a pretty analogous story for the higgs boson mass had to wait twenty years more to be accomplished . in july 2012",
    "the higgs boson discovery was announced with a mass @xmath48 gev ( atlas@xcite ) and @xmath49 gev ( cms @xcite ) , against an indirect determination from the electroweak fit of @xmath50 gev .",
    "the indirect sensitivity of the electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) to physics at higher energies has not only played a role in constraining @xmath28 and @xmath23 , but has also been seen from the beginning as a possible search for signals of new physics . as a matter of fact , until the discovery of at least the top , the separation between the two issues was to some extent not easy to achieve .",
    "there are three different ways that can be used to try to identify the sensitivity of the ewpt to new physics , with relations to each other : i ) the examination of effects in specific models ; ii ) the identification of effective parameters or of effective observables relevant in specific contexts ; iii ) the use of effective field theory ( eft ) . for clarity , to describe them it is better not to follow a strict chronological order .      inspired by the early work on heavy higgs and top in the sm , as already described , and in preparation for the @xmath29 colliders working at the @xmath51 pole , attention was drawn to the contributions to precision observables from the electroweak vacuum polarizations amplitudes@xcite @xmath52 \\eta^{\\mu\\nu } + ( q^\\mu q^\\nu\\mathrm{\\small -terms})\\ ] ] with @xmath53 or possibly @xmath54 for the @xmath55 or the @xmath56 bosons respectively .",
    "of particular relevance in this context are two quantities @xmath57@xcite @xmath58 whenever an expansion in @xmath59 is meaningful , @xmath60 is the leading parameter describing `` custodial symmetry '' breaking , since @xmath61 , whereas @xmath62 is the leading term that respects it .",
    "we shall see in a moment how @xmath62 and @xmath60 relate to physical observables .",
    "although @xmath62 and @xmath60 are normally defined as due to new physics only , in the sm they are the only terms receiving the one loop logarithms in a large @xmath23 expansion that we have already encountered , @xmath63    after electroweak symmetry breaking there are four non vanishing vacuum polarization amplitudes , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which , expanded up to first order in @xmath59 , are determined by eight coefficients .",
    "three of them are absorbed in the definition of the parameters @xmath66 and two are related by gauge invariance of unbroken electromagnetism : @xmath67 . as a consequence , other than @xmath62 and @xmath60 , it is useful to introduce a third quantity@xcite @xmath68 which",
    ", however , while also breaking `` custodial symmetry '' , is subleading with respect to @xmath60 in a @xmath59 expansion and , as such , does not contain any `` large '' @xmath69 term . at second order in @xmath59 four more parameters appear@xcite .",
    "unlike @xmath70 , two of these four extra parameters respect the electroweak gauge group , but , as @xmath70 , they are also calculable in the sm , since they are related to operators of dimension 6 .",
    "as already mentioned , observables at the @xmath51 pole have played and are still playing a major role in the comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "this rapidly led to realize that every new physics respecting quark - lepton and flavour universality could affect the @xmath51 pole observables and the w - mass only via three effective parameters @xmath71 , defined in terms of @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ deltar ] ) and of the effective couplings @xmath73 to the @xmath51 boson of a fermion @xmath74 of non zero charge @xmath75 and third component of the weak isospin @xmath76",
    "as@xcite @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 a few comments on these parameters are useful to make .",
    "eq.s ( [ ga ] ) and ( [ gvga ] ) refer to any light charged fermion except the @xmath80-quark , where already in the sm there is the flavour non - universal correction ( [ z->bb ] ) due to top loops . to incorporate it together with any other possible new physics effect of the same kind , thus breaking flavor universality",
    ", one has to include another parameter @xmath81 in the effective couplings of the @xmath80 quark@xcite : @xmath82    in the parameters @xmath83 there is no reference to a @xmath59 expansion nor any restriction to vacuum polarization corrections only .",
    "an explicit expression for the vacuum polarization contributions to @xmath84 is @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 @xmath87 with new physics in oblique corrections only and a characteristic scale @xmath88 such that an expansion in @xmath89 is meaningful , a comparison of these equations with eq.s ( [ st]-[u ] ) shows that @xmath84 may be approximated by @xmath90 respectively and @xmath60 contain the leading @xmath91 terms , the full dependence of the ewc on @xmath92 is only included in the @xmath83@xcite ] .",
    "two - dimensional probability distributions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 at @xmath95 ( the dark region ) and @xmath96 ( the light region ) with all four @xmath97 floating ( upper left ) or fixing @xmath98 ( upper right),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=44.0% ]   two - dimensional probability distributions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 at @xmath95 ( the dark region ) and @xmath96 ( the light region ) with all four @xmath97 floating ( upper left ) or fixing @xmath98 ( upper right),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=44.0% ]   two - dimensional probability distributions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 at @xmath95 ( the dark region ) and @xmath96 ( the light region ) with all four @xmath97 floating ( upper left ) or fixing @xmath98 ( upper right),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=44.0% ]      note finally that with the definitions ( [ ga]-[eps_b ] ) the @xmath83 include every electroweak correction , both from the sm and from possible new physics , so that it is useful to define the separation @xmath100 .",

    "it depends on a specific model of new physics which one among fig.s 1 has to be used to constrain it .    as one can see from these figures",
    ", the size of the error on the @xmath83 is currently at the @xmath104 level , which means , comparing with ( [ eps_i_sm ] ) , that the electroweak radiative corrections in the sm have been seen at about the @xmath105 level of their typical value .",
    "interestingly this is about the same level of precision at which the loops in flavour changing neutral current processes are currently tested .",
    "so far no deviation from the sm has emerged in either case .",
    "it is customary to view the sm as an effective low energy approximation of a more fundamental theory involving the same low energy degrees of freedom and already valid at shorter distances . as a consequence",
    "a more complete lagrangian describing physics at any scale below a cutoff @xmath106 is @xmath107 in terms of any gauge invariant operator @xmath108 of dimension @xmath109 , made of the sm fields .",
    "while the presence of these extra operators has in itself nothing to do with the ewc , the study of their effects has proven effective in describing the implications of the ewpt . in turn",
    "such effects typically arise from the interference of these operators with radiatively corrected sm amplitudes .",
    "this approach has indeed been pursued already in the nineties during the first decade of lep operation and is receiving further recent attention through the measurements of the higgs boson properties .",
    "the relative drawback of this approach is in the large number of independent operators that are involved and can affect many different observables .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to recall the most significant bounds on the scale @xmath106 that were first obtained after a decade of lep operation@xcite and compare them with the corresponding current bounds@xcite .",
    "they are shown in table 1 at @xmath96 c.l .. the bounds are obtained by considering one operator at a time with the relative coefficient @xmath110 , since what counts is the interference with the radiatively corrected sm amplitudes . furthermore , in the columns from the data in the year 2000 , the higgs boson mass was taken at 115 gev , consistent with the direct bound and corresponding to the indirect indication of the ewpt at that time .",
    "the first operator in table 1 contributes as well to correct the higgs boson width into a pair of photons , which is loop suppressed in the sm . from current data on this width one",
    "obtains the bounds@xcite @xmath111 these are the strongest bounds obtainable to date from the higgs boson coupling measurements .",
    "the bounds on @xmath106 in the year 2000 , compared with the `` naturalness '' estimate of the radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass @xmath112 and the already mentioned indication for a light higgs boson in the same year 2000 , motivated the title `` lep paradox '' of ref . @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the identification of the two @xmath106 parameters entering in eq.s ( [ lbsm ] ) and ( [ naturalness ] ) has to be taken with a grain of salt , since in suitable extensions of the sm the squares of these parameters are related to each other by a loop factor .    . @xmath96 lower bounds on @xmath113tev for the individual operators .",
    "the first two columns are from the year 2000 data @xcite , whereas the third and fourth columns are from the currently available data@xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     all the content of sections 3 and 4 rests on the high precision that has been achieved so far in computing the ewc in the sm",
    ". some key quantities like the w mass ( or @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ deltar ] ) ) and the effective leptonic mixing angle @xmath114 have been computed in the sm to full two loop order , which consists of many different contributions@xcite due to the several coupling constants and particles involved , and including as well some relevant 3 loops , going e.g. like @xmath115 or @xmath116@xcite . as a result the current theoretical uncertainty from the missing higher order terms , as inferred for example from comparing the calculations in different renormalization schemes , is estimated for @xmath117 at about @xmath118 mev and on @xmath119 at about @xmath120 . to these uncertainties",
    "one has to add the parametric errors of 9 mev for @xmath117 and of @xmath121 for @xmath119 , obtained with @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124@xcite .",
    "this has to be compared with the current experimental errors of 15 mev for @xmath117 and @xmath125 for @xmath119 .",
    "all these numbers are collected in table 2 .",
    "while the theoretical uncertainties look adequate to compare with current precision measurements , significant improvements will be necessary to make full use of the precision foreseen at future facilities like , e.g. , fcc - ee@xcite , also shown in table 2 .",
