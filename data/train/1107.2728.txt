    "the seminal work of oppenheimer and snyder led to the establishment viewpoint that the end state of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse is a black hole which have an event horizon to external observers @xcite . hawking and penrose proven",
    "that , according to general relativity , there must be a singularity of infinite density of matter and space - time curvature formed by gravitational collapse @xcite . at the singularity , the laws of science and the ability to predict the future would break down .",
    "this led penrose to propose the ( weak and strong ) cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch ) @xcite , which to date remain unproven .",
    "the weak cch asserts that there can be no singularity visible from future null infinity , light from singularity is completely blocked by the event horizon , while the strong cch prohibits singularity s visibility by any observer . despite almost 40 years of effort we still do nt have a general proof of cch @xcite . on the contrary , it was shown that the work of oppenheimer and snyder @xcite which forbidden the formation of the naked singularity is not a typical model , and the singularities formed in generic collapse are naked and observable @xcite .",
    "recently , virbhadra , ellis , keeton , etc showed that black holes and naked singularities can be observationally differentiated through their gravitational lensing effects .",
    "they classified naked singularities into 3 categories : weakly naked , marginally strongly naked , strongly naked singularities @xcite , and hypothesize a new cosmic censorship : generically , marginally and strongly naked singularities do not occur in a realistic gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "they conjecture that in case the weak cch of penrose turns out to be incorrect , the new cosmic censorship will hold good .    in recent years ,",
    "superstring / m theory caused a renewed interest about higher order gravity in more than @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the most extensively studied model in the effective low - energy action of superstring theory @xcite is so - called einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity ( egb ) @xcite .",
    "an interesting question will be , how does gauss - bonnet term change the collapse of a massive body ?",
    "recently , maeda considered the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of a inhomogeneous dust with the @xmath2-dimensional action including the gauss - bonnet term without finding the explicit form of the solution @xcite .",
    "then , jhingan and ghosh presented a exact model of the gravitational collapse of a inhomogeneous dust in five dimensional egb @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to extend their work to a more general case .",
    "we investigate the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of an incoherent dust cloud by considering a lemaitre - tolman - bondi type space - time in egb without the cosmological constant , and give three families of ltb - like solutions , which are hyperbolic , parabolic and elliptic , respectively . in order to find the final fate of the collapse",
    ", we discuss the formation of singularities , and analyze the nature of them .",
    "in particular , we consider that whether such singularities would be hidden or be visible to outside observers . we also investigate the gravitational strength of naked singularities , and discuss that whether the naked singularities in egb theory is a serious threat to cch .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec [ 22s ] , we give the field equations in egb without a cosmological constant , and derive the ltb - like solutions . in sec [ 33s ] , we investigate the formation of the singularity of the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse , and analyze the global structure of space - time . the strength of the singularity is demonstrated in sec [ 55s ] .",

    "( [ eq:8a ] ) . notice that the expression for function @xmath41 is similar to ltb and ltb - like ( in the space - time with more than @xmath1 dimensions ) solutions in general relativity @xcite .",
    "now , we return to discuss the above ltb - like solution attached at the boundary of a dust cloud to the outside vacuum region .",

    "first , we consider the formation of the singularity . there are two kinds of singularities which are shell crossing singularities and shell focusing singularities , defined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the characteristic of a singularity in space - time manifold is the divergence of the riemann tensor and the energy density @xcite . in our case , the kretschmann invariant scalar @xmath55 for the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq:4a ] ) is @xmath56}{r'^2r^4},\\label{eq:15a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and can be shown to be finite on the initial data surface .",
    "the energy density of the fluid dust sphere is @xmath57 .",
    "it is clear that both kretschmann scalar and energy density diverge when @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "hence , we have the shell crossing and shell focusing singularities .",
    "shell crossing singularities can be naked , and has been shown to be gravitationally weak in the ltb case , which can not be consider seriously in the context of the cch @xcite . on the other hand , in general relativity , shell focusing singularities can also be naked and gravitationally strong as well . henceforth , shell focusing singularities are considered to be the genuine singularities in space - time manifold @xcite .",
    "here we only limit in the shell focusing singularities .",
    "it is known that the gravitational collapse in the 5d egb with the marginally bound case @xmath37 leads to a shell focusing singularity , and positive @xmath58 delays the formation of the singularity @xcite . in higher dimensional egb",
    ", one can easily find @xmath59 that is , the collapsing of the shell @xmath60 from the finite initial data @xmath61 is accelerated .",
    "thus , @xmath15 will vanish in finite proper time for the comoving observer , the shell focusing singularity is inevitably formed in the three cases @xmath37 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , using eq .",
    "( [ eq:14a ] ) we obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "apparently we have @xmath67 , and then the velocity of collapsing decreases with increasing @xmath68 .",
    "this result indicates that positive @xmath58 delays the formation of the shell crossing singularity for @xmath37 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 in higher dimensional @xmath0 space - times .    in the homogeneous collapse , the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq:4a ] ) takes the form as the robertson - walker metric @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a constant . in order",
    "to satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq:8a ] ) , we can normalize the radial coordinate @xmath13 so that @xmath71 .",
    "it is clear that the time when the shell hits shell focusing singularity is completely determined by @xmath72 .",
    "therefore it is independent on @xmath13 , as in the general relativity case .",
    "we can check such a consequence by using eq .",
    "( [ eq:14a ] ) . in the homogeneous case , @xmath73 is written in the form @xmath74 considering eq .",
    "( [ eq:18a ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq:19a ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq:14a ] ) , we get @xmath75 this equation does not contain the variable @xmath13 , that is , @xmath76 is a function of @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that every shell collapse into the shell focusing singularity at the same time .",
    "maeda proved that in the homogeneous collapse with the marginally bound case @xmath37 , the shell crossing singularity is ingoing null for @xmath77 and is space - like for @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "more generally , we can extend such a consequence to cases @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "considering eq .",
    "( [ eq:20a ] ) we have @xmath79 since the energy density @xmath80 have a finite non - negative value , we find that the factor @xmath81 behaves as @xmath82 near the singularity @xmath83 .",
    "we take the line element of the frw solutions with the factor @xmath84 to the conformally flat form as @xmath85 where @xmath86 the range of @xmath87 for @xmath88 is @xmath89 and @xmath90 , for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , where @xmath91 is a constant .",
    "thus , the shell focusing singularity is ingoing null for @xmath77 , while it is space - like for @xmath78 , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "next , we consider whether such a shell focusing singularity is naked or covered by an event horizon .",
    "an important constructions in general relativity is that of the apparent horizon , which is the outermost marginally trapped surface for the outgoing null geodesics @xcite .",
    "the apparent horizon is local in time and can be located at a given space - like hypersurface , while the event horizon coincides in case of static or stationary space - time and is non - local .",
    "moreover , the event horizon is a outer covering surface of apparent horizons , that is , without the presence of apparent horizons there is no event horizon .",
    "the condition for the existence of the apparent horizon with outward normals null is @xmath92 using eq .",
    "( [ eq:6a ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq:13a ] ) , the apparent horizon condition becomes @xmath93 then we obtain @xmath94 clearly , the coupling constant @xmath58 produces a change in the location of these horizons .",
    "jhingan and ghosh found that , in 5d case the positive @xmath58 forbids apparent horizon from reaching the coordinate center thereby making the singularity massive and eternally visible , which is forbidden in the corresponding general relativistic scenario @xcite .",
    "we will show , in the @xmath78 space - time , the naked singularity would not be formed except at the coordinate center .",
    "it is easy to find the condition that eq .",
    "( [ eq:25a ] ) could not be satisfied before the formation of the singularity is @xmath95 , in the 5d space - time , and the apparent horizon hits the singularity when @xmath96 . in these cases",
    ", the shell focusing singularity can be visible from infinity with certain initial data of energy density and leave open even the weak form of cch @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the shell focusing singularity is forever visible from future null infinity after it has been formed if @xmath97 in the 5d case , where @xmath98 is the boundary of the collapsing dust cloud . in other words",
    ", there is no black hole can be formed if the mass function @xmath99 takes sufficiently small value .",
    "however , it can be seen obviously that in the @xmath0 space - time the apparent horizon lies in front of the singularity unless @xmath100 , thus the solution forbids the formation of the naked singularity except the singular point at the center , as same as in the general relativity @xcite .    for the homogeneous collapse , it is easy to find @xmath101 obviously , @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath103 is negative , the shell with greater coordinate value @xmath13 reaches @xmath104 earlier , hence the singular shells which hit the singularity at the same time could not be visible from infinity with the presence of apparent horizons .",
    "as demonstrated above , our solution can be attached to the outside vacuum solution at the boundary of the dust cloud .",
    "hence , using the conclusions of the global structure of space - time mentioned in @xcite , we get that in the outside vacuum region , the singularity is outgoing time - like if it is eternally visible , is outgoing space - like if the apparent horizon lies backward it , and is outgoing null if the apparent horizon hits it",
    ". we can give penrose diagrams for the homogeneous collapse as shown in fig.1 .",
    "in addition , it can be noted that eq .",
    "( [ eq:24a ] ) takes the same form for cases @xmath62 ,",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath37 , therefore the discussion about the apparent horizon in the case @xmath37 which is given by jhingan and ghosh can be applied to cases @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we consider whether cch is violated by naked singularities formed in the gravitational collapse in egb .",
    "first we discuss the new cch propose by virbhadra , ellis , keeton , etc .",
    "this group classified naked singularities into 3 categories by their gravitational lensing effects : weakly naked , marginally strongly naked , and strongly naked singularities .",
    "naked singularities contained within at least one photon sphere are termed weakly naked singularities .",
    "marginally strongly naked and strongly naked singularities are not covered within any photon spheres , and strongly naked singularities can produce images of gravitational lensing with negative time delays @xcite .",
    "the new cch is that only weakly naked singularities can be formed in the realistic gravitational collapse .",
    "the photon sphere equation obtained by them is applied to a general static spherically symmetric metric .",
    "since the naked singularities formed in @xmath0 egb is visible for only one moment and the metric is not static in this moment , so we only consider observational classification of naked singularities which formed in 5d egb .    for",
    "a static spherically symmetric space - time @xmath105 the photon sphere equation take the form of @xcite @xmath106 since our solution can be attached to the outside vacuum solution , after all shells collapse into the singularity , the space - time can be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq:00a ] ) , and the photon equation eq .",
    "( [ eq:000a ] ) becomes @xmath107 the positive real solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:010a ] ) is @xmath108^{\\frac{1}{4 } } , \\quad \\frac{2m}{3\\omega_3}>\\tilde{\\alpha}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to that @xmath109 . under such condition , however , the shell focusing singularity is not naked in 5d egb as shown in the penrose diagram .",
    "hence , the photon equation have no real solution while the naked singularity has been formed in 5d egb",
    ". consequently , naked , massive and uncentral singularities formed in 5d egb are marginally strongly or strongly naked singularities , which is a counter example of the new cch suggested by virbhadra @xcite .",
    "physically , the gravitation collapse is a dynamical procedure .",
    "one should apply the dynamical photon sphere equation given in @xcite to analyze the collapse .",
    "the equation takes the form @xcite @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 . since our concern is the final fate of the collapse rather than the dynamic process , we are regretful to abandon the discussion of this equation .",
    "next , we consider the strength of the singularity @xcite .",
    "the importance of the strength of the singularity lies in the fact that even if a naked singularity occurs , if it is gravitationally weak in some suitable sense , it may not have any physical implications and it may perhaps be removable by extending the space - time @xcite .",
    "a sufficient condition for a strong curvature singularity is that in the limit of approach to the singularity , we must have along at least one causal geodesic @xmath113 @xcite , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the tangent vector to the geodesic .",
    "the idea captured here is that in the limit of approach to such a singularity , the physical objects get crushed to a zero size , and so the idea of extension of space - time through it would not make sense , characterizing this to be a genuine space - time singularity .",
    "jhingan and ghosh pointed out that in the 5d space - time the central singularity which can be naked may be gravitational weak @xcite .",
    "we will prove that although the gauss - bonnet term weakens the strength of singularity , the central singularity in the case @xmath78 which can also be visible is gravitational strong .",
    "we consider radial time - like causal geodesics @xmath116 with the marginally bound case @xmath37 , here the affine parameter @xmath117 is the proper time along particle trajectories .",
    "according to such definition , @xmath118 satisfies @xmath119 that is , @xmath120 using the geodesic equation , we have @xmath121 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq:28a ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:29a ] ) , we obtain that radial time - like geodesics must satisfy @xmath122 = 0.\\label{eq:30a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the simplest solution is the worldline of a freely falling particle , which is @xmath123 . in terms of proper time",
    "we can describe it as @xmath124 we consider the expansion of @xmath125 near @xmath100 @xmath126 it specifies that @xmath41 behaves as @xmath127 near the coordinate center , where @xmath128 is a function of @xmath14 and vanishes at @xmath129 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath130 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq:16a ] ) , we obtain that @xmath131,\\label{eq:34a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 is defined as @xmath133 therefore has finite value . in the limit @xmath134",
    "we have @xmath135 thus , @xmath136 consequently , @xmath137 the strong curvature condition is satisfied in the case @xmath78 and is not satisfied in the case @xmath77 .",
    "hence , the central shell focusing singularity is gravitational strong in the @xmath78 space - time while it may be gravitational weak in the 5d space - time .",
    "the difference between two cases is that the singularity can be eternally visible in the 5d case while it is disallowed in the @xmath78 case .",
    "therefore , the singularity is gravitational strong when the solution represents the black hole formation for arbitrary initial data .",
    "if a naked singularity is gravitational weak , it may not have any significant physical consequences and so may not be a serious threat to the weak cch of penrose and the new cch of ellis s group .",
    "thus , the naked singularity in the @xmath0 case violates the cch , as in the general relativity @xcite , while the naked singularity may not be regarded as an essential counter example to the cch seriously in the 5d case .",
    "furthermore , such a central singularity in the 5d case is gravitational strong in the general relativistic limit . in the limit @xmath21 , in @xmath138 space - time , eq .",
    "( [ eq:34a ] ) takes the form @xmath139.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq:35a ] ) becomes @xmath140 thus , @xmath141 the strong curvature condition is satisfied in the 5d space - time .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq:37a ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq:36a ] ) , we find that high order lovelock terms weaken the strength of the singularity .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric dust cloud in the egb without a cosmological constant , and extended works of maeda , jhingan and ghosh to a more general case .",
    "as we demonstrated , the final fate of the collapsing dust cloud is a shell focusing singularity which can be either hidden or naked .",
    "we analyzed the global structure of the space - time and gave the penrose diagram for the homogeneous case .",
    "it turns out that , the contribution of gauss - bonnet curvature corrections alters the course of collapse and the time of formation of singularities , modifies apparent horizon formation and the location of apparent horizons , and changes the strength of singularities . unlike the 5d case",
    ", there is a serious threat to the cch caused by the naked , gravitational strong singularity in the @xmath0 case .",
