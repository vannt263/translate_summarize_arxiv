    "the spectroscopic properties of galaxies in the wavelength range 2.512  are much less well known than in the optical regime , where stellar emission dominates , and in the far - infrared , where thermal continuum emission from cool interstellar dust dominates .",
    "prior to the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ; kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) mission , spectroscopic information on this wavelength region was available for only a few of the brightest galaxies and galaxy nuclei , which were observed with ground - based telescopes through a few spectral windows ( e.g. ,  roche et al .",
    "1991 ) , or with the _ iras _ low - resolution spectrometer ( e.g. ,  cohen & volk 1989 ) .",
    "however , this relatively unexplored spectral region contains important signatures of interstellar dust particles , in particular the broad emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3  ( gillett et al .  1973 ) which in the past were often called the `` unidentified infrared '' or uir features .",
    "these features are now known to be ubiquitous in the ism of our galaxy : they are seen in and pdr regions ( e.g. ,  csarsky et al .",
    "1996 ; roelfsema et al .  1996",
    "; verstraete et al .  1996 , 2001 ) ; planetary nebulae and circumstellar regions ( e.g. ,  beintema et al .",
    "1996 ) ; reflection nebulae ( e.g. ,  boulanger et al .",
    "1996 , uchida , sellgren , & werner 1998 ) ; and diffuse cirrus clouds ( e.g. ,  mattila et al .",
    "1996 ; lemke et al .  1998 ; chan et al .",
    "2001 ) . taken together",
    ", they radiate a significant fraction of the total ir emission from these regions ( e.g. ,  puget & lger 1989 ) .",
    "while the exact identity of the carriers of the uir features is still unresolved , it is generally agreed that the features arise from vibrational modes of a carbon - based , aromatic material , so we will refer to them hereafter as aromatic features in emission , or `` afes . ''",
    "possible candidate materials range from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( hereafter pahs ; lger & puget 1984 ; allamandola , tielens , & barker 1985 , 1989 ; puget & lger 1989 ) to hydrogenated amorphous carbon grains ( duley & williams 1981 , 1988 ) .",
    "the current picture is that the particles responsible for the emission , whether present as free molecules or being attached to larger grains , are transiently heated by the absorption of single uv photons to @xmath5k .",
    "the carriers of the afes may also play an important role in regulating the physical conditions in the ism by contributing significantly to photoelectric heating of the gas ( bakes & tielens 1994 ; helou et al .",
    "2001 ; however , for an alternate point of view , see chan et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the spectral region also hosts a possible near - infrared , non - stellar continuum emission with a color temperature of @xmath0k , which was first detected in galactic reflection nebulae ( andriesse 1978 ; sellgren , werner , & dinerstein 1983 ; sellgren 1984 ) .",
    "recent observations with _",
    "cobe _ and _ irts _ hint that this near - ir continuum may also be present on larger scales in our galaxy ( bernard et al .",
    "1994 ; tanaka et al .",
    "1996 ) , but it has not been previously reported in external galaxies .    with its unprecedented sensitivity and contiguous wavelength coverage , _ iso _ made it possible to obtain 2.511.6  spectra of large numbers of galaxies that were too faint to observe previously .",
    "as part of an _ iso _ key project to study the physical properties of the ism in galaxies ( helou et al .  1997 ; dale et al .",
    "2000 ) , we obtained 2.511.6  spectra using the pht - s mode of iso - phot ( lemke et al .",
    "1996 ) for 45 galaxies .",
    "this survey covered the full range of morphological types of disk galaxies , s0 to i m , that are powered by star formation . similar _",
    "spectra of other types of galaxies can be found elsewhere : e.g. ,  agns ( clavel et al .  2000 ) , ultraluminous ir galaxies ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; rigopoulou et al .",
    "1999 ) , and galaxies of moderately low surface brightnesses such as the magellanic clouds ( reach et al .",
    "2000 ; sturm et al .",
    "2000 ; vermeij et al .",
    "the afes are seen in the spectra of most of these objects , but are absent or too weak to detect in elliptical galaxies ( lu & hur 2000 ; 2003 ; athey et al .",
    "2002 ) and extremely metal deficient dwarfs ( e.g. ,  thuan , sauvage , & madden 1999 ) .    in paper",
    "i ( helou et al .",
    "2000 ) , we presented spectra for a subsample of 7 galaxies , highlighted the detections of the afes and a near - infrared , non - stellar continuum emission , and suggested that the averaged spectrum of a number of galaxies could provide a useful template for redshift determinations of distant star - forming galaxies . in the present paper , we explore more fully the diversity of the 2.512  spectra of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we present and compare the individual spectra of all the 45 observed galaxies , provide a quantitative analysis of various spectral components , evaluate variations from galaxy to galaxy and possible statistical correlations with galaxy properties at other wavelengths , and discuss possible reasons for these trends . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use nir and mir to refer to the 2.54.9   and 5.811.6  spectral regions respectively , and afe(3.3 ) , afe(6.2 ) , afe(7.7 ) , afe(8.6 ) and afe(11.3 ) for the corresponding individual features .",
    "the galaxies studied in this paper are a subset of a larger sample observed for the key project .",
    "this parent sample consists of 69 `` normal '' galaxies selected to capture the great diversity in the properties of galaxies in the local universe , especially in terms of the ratio of current to past star - formation rate . for each galaxy in this project we obtained at least one of the following : iso - cam images at 7 and 15  ( see dale et al .",
    "2000 ) , a sparsely sampled iso - lws spectrum between 43 and 200   targeting fine - structure lines ( malhotra et al .  2001 and",
    "references therein ) , and a pht - s 2.511.6  spectrum as presented here .",
    "table  1 lists the 45 key project galaxies for which we obtained a pht - s spectrum .",
    "the position of each observation in the table was reconstructed from the _ iso _ pointing history ( iiph ) file , which in most cases was the same as the intended position .",
    "nearly all of the observations were taken at the galaxy optical center , except for two off - center positions in ngc  1569 which correspond to emission peaks on the cam images ( hunter et al .",
    "2001 ) . from table  1",
    "it can be seen that the blue luminosity @xmath6 ranges from 2 @xmath7 to @xmath8 , the fir - to - blue luminosity ratio  from 0.2 to 15 , and the _ iras _",
    "60-to-100  color index @xmath2 from 0.3 to 1.3 .",
    "the heliocentric velocities [ col .",
    "( 10 ) ] were used to shift all spectra to a common ( rest ) frame for easier comparison .",
    "the median velocity of the sample is about 1800 .",
    "1 shows the distribution of the galaxies in a plot of @xmath9 _ vs. _ @xmath2 .",
    "most of the galaxies fall along a rough diagonal from the lower left to upper right corner of the diagram , a trend which we attribute to an increasing ratio of present - day star forming activity to the time - averaged star - formation rate in the past ( e.g. ,  helou 1986 ) . in this paper",
    "we assume that both axes in fig .",
    "1 are statistically valid measures of the global amount of current star - formation activity in a galaxy , and thus of the uv - to - optical spectral shape of the radiation field .",
    "we define three galaxy subsamples : an `` fir - quiescent '' subsample , represented by open squares in fig .  1 ; an `` fir - active '' group , represented by filled squares ; and an intermediate subsample , shown as crosses .",
    "the few outliers in fig .  1 include the compact galaxy ngc@xmath14418 , which has higher @xmath2 than 99% of the galaxies in the _ iras _ bright galaxy sample ( soifer et al .",
    "1989 ) , and the low - metallicity irregular galaxy ngc@xmath11569 which has low .",
    "most of the outliers also show peculiarities in their pht - s spectra ; we comment on these individually in  3.2 .",
    "the pht - s spectrometer has two 64-element linear si : ga detector arrays .",
    "the ss array covers the wavelength range 2.54.9  with spectral resolution element 0.04 while the sl array covers the interval 5.811.6  with a resolution element of 0.1 .",
    "the instrument has a @xmath10 aperture on the sky , pointed with an accuracy @xmath11 ( kessler et al .",
    "for each galaxy , the ss and sl spectra were obtained simultaneously , through an aperture placed at the position given in table  1 .",
    "sky reference observations were taken at symmetrically placed offsets of @xmath12 from the galaxy center along a direction determined by the spacecraft roll angle at the time of the observation .",
    "integration times were 512 seconds , split evenly between the galaxy and sky positions , with a duration of 64 sec per chopper step , except for the faint object ic@xmath1860 , for which we increased the total integration time to 2048 seconds .",
    "the spectra were derived from the edited raw data using standard procedures in the phot interactive analysis package ( pia version 7 ; gabriel et al .",
    "1997 ) , including deglitching at both ramp and signal levels , ramp slope fitting , signal averaging per chopper position , and sky subtraction of the average signal for the two sky reference positions .",
    "the flux calibration was performed using a signal - dependent `` detector response function '' obtained from chopped observations of calibration stars with known sed s .",
    "this `` direct calibration , '' which was later incorporated into pipeline version 8.4 , included an empirical correction for the signal loss due to a detector transient induced by the chopper switching between the source and the reference positions .",
    "since we used point - source flux standards , our spectra represent the effective emission corresponding to the integration of a normalized pht - s beam profile over the surface brightness distribution of the source , divided by @xmath13 , the fraction of the point - source spread function within the pht - s aperture ( see appendix a ) . for the ss detector pixels , the median flux uncertainty @xmath14 @xmath15mjy and depends only weakly on the source flux .",
    "in contrast , @xmath16 varies from 15 mjy to 45 mjy over the sample and scales roughly linearly with source brightness . according to the data validation report from pipeline version 8.4 ,",
    "the absolute and relative flux uncertainties are on order of 10% for point sources .",
    "as described in appendix a , we performed an independent check on the flux calibration by comparing our pht - s data with the cam imaging data of dale et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; these agree to better than 18% for 58.5  and @xmath17 25% for the 45   region .",
    "we used near - infrared images from the large galaxy atlas of the 2-micron all sky survey , 2mass ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) to derive integrated @xmath18 ( 1.25 ) , @xmath19 ( 1.65 ) , and @xmath20 ( 2.17 ) magnitudes for each galaxy , appropriate to the placement of the pht - s aperture on the sky during the _ iso _ observations . since there is not yet a finalized conversion formula from the 2mass magnitude scale to flux densities , we normalized our 2mass magnitudes to the multi - aperture observations of four early - type galaxies ( ngc 4374 , ngc 3379 , ngc 5866 , and ngc 1326 ) published by frogel et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and persson , frogel , & aaronson ( 1979 ) , using the magnitude - to - flux conversions of wilson , schwartz , & neugebauer ( 1972 ) . to adjust our 2mass photometry to the magnitude scale in these references",
    ", we found it necessary to add the following offsets : ( 0.028 @xmath21 0.009)@xmath22 at @xmath18 , ( 0.052 @xmath21 0.004)@xmath22 for @xmath19 , and ( 0.079 @xmath21 0.010)@xmath22 to convert from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( 2.2 ) .",
    "the resulting 2mass fluxes are used to normalize our pht - s spectra in  3 and  4 to unveil the nir excess continuum in disk galaxies .",
    "this requires no significant zero - point offset between the 2mass and pht - s flux scales .",
    "we show in appendix  b that this is indeed the case .",
    "the sky - subtracted , rest - frame pht - s spectra are presented in figures  2@xmath25 - 2@xmath26 .",
    "table  2 summarizes the pht - s aperture coverage factor @xmath27 ( see appendix a ) , the mean continuum flux density at 4 , and a mean flux density for each of the afes .",
    "these mean flux densities , defined in the footnotes to table  2 , are derived after shifting the spectrum to the rest frame and resampling the data at the pht - s detector wavelengths by a linear interpolation between the two nearest data points .",
    "note that the mean flux density for afe(11.3 ) is basically taken over only the blue side of the feature , since part of the red side fell outside our wavelength coverage .",
    "the last 2 lines in table  2 provide information on two elliptical galaxies , ngc  3379 and ngc  4374 , whose pht - s spectra were discussed by lu & hur ( 2000 ; 2003 ) , and which served as comparison objects for the disk galaxies (  4.1 ) .",
    "the great majority of the observed galaxies show qualitatively similar pht - s spectra . the mir part of the spectra is typically dominated by the prominent afe features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3 , which have relative strengths and profiles similar to those of `` type  a '' galactic sources as described , for example , by geballe ( 1997 ) and tokunaga ( 1997 ) .",
    "these features are superposed on a nir continuum dominated by the emission from stellar photospheres .",
    "of all the spectra , only that of ngc@xmath14418 display mir structures that are qualitatively different from a type  a spectrum .",
    "we discuss in more detail this unique spectrum and a few others in  3.2 .",
    "the similarity of most of the spectra in the range 5.811.6  suggests that it is useful to derive an averaged spectrum to serve as a template for normal , star - forming galaxies .",
    "we derived such an average spectrum from 40 of the 45 galaxies in this study , omitting only the atypical galaxies ngc  4418 and ngc  1569 ( see above , and  3.2 ) , and the three galaxies with the lowest s / n ratios in their spectra ( ngc@xmath13705 , ngc@xmath14519 , and ngc@xmath17418 ) .",
    "the average spectrum was obtained on a wavelength pixel - by - pixel basis from the resampled , rest - frame individual spectra ( see  2.4 ) normalized at some fiducial wavelength . no correction for redshift was made to the _ jhk _ points described in  2.3 , since the effects are negligible for these broad photometric bands .",
    "the averaged spectra resulting from two choices of the fiducial wavelength for normalization are shown in fig .",
    "the open squares depict the spectrum obtained by normalizing the individual spectra at _",
    "j _ , while the thick solid curve corresponds to normalizing by the integrated flux of afe(7.7 ) .",
    "in both cases we used @xmath28-weighted averaging , where @xmath29 is either @xmath14 or @xmath16 depending on which detector array segment the pixel under consideration belongs to ; the _ jhk _ data points were averaged using the same @xmath29-weights as used for the pht - ss data .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "3 represent @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the standard deviation of the normalized fluxes and @xmath32 is the number of galaxies included in the average ( due to the redshifts of individual galaxies , @xmath33 for some points near the array edges ) . for a given pixel ,",
    "@xmath31 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the flux density and weight from the @xmath37th sample galaxy , and @xmath38 is the average flux of the pixel .",
    "therefore , these error bars reflect mainly the variation of spectral shape within the sample .",
    "note that the two normalization methods have different biases : normalization at 7.7  gives greater weight to individual spectra which are more dominated by emission from the ism ( e.g. ,  the afes ) , whereas normalization at _ j _ gives greater weight to galaxies with a larger proportional contribution of starlight .",
    "the averaged spectra in fig .",
    "3 can be compared with the `` template '' spectrum presented in fig .  2 of paper",
    "i. the latter was a straight average [ i.e. ,  with @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] over a subset of 28 galaxies .",
    "in addition , a different phot calibration and a different normalization parameter ( the strength of the 6.2  afe ) was used .",
    "the main differences are limited to @xmath40 ; the mir region of the template spectrum from paper i is very similar to those derived here if they are all normalized in the same way .",
    "we also compare our average disk galaxy spectra with those of the two elliptical galaxies , ngc@xmath13379 and ngc@xmath14374 .",
    "the pht - s spectra of these two e1 galaxies , reduced from the _ iso _ archive data by lu & hur ( 2003 ) , are shown in fig .  3 as a thin solid line and dotted line respectively .",
    "at a heliocentric redshift of @xmath41 , ngc  3379 ( m@xmath1105 ) is one of the nearest normal giant elliptical galaxies , with a classical r@xmath42 profile ( de vaucouleurs & capaccioli 1979 ) .",
    "ngc  4374 ( m@xmath184 ) , at @xmath43 , is known to host a central radio source ( cf . bridle & perley 1984 ) , and contains at least some interstellar matter , indicated by the presence of dust lanes and _ iras _ detections at 60 and 100 .",
    "nevertheless , these two ellipticals have quite similar pht - s spectra , nearly featureless and falling roughly as a rayleigh - jeans law from 1.25 to @xmath44 7 .",
    "an apparent flattening beyond 8  may be due to circumstellar dust emission ( knapp , gunn , & wynn - williams 1992 ; athey et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "3 that the spiral galaxies show clear excess emission compared to the ellipticals at all wavelengths @xmath45 2.2 . in table  3",
    ", we list the numerical values of the two average disk - galaxy spectra in fig .  3 , as well as the average for the two e galaxies . these averaged spectra , because of their high s",
    "/ n , offer a more sensitive way to study the profiles of the brighter afes and to look for weak features that might be buried in noise in individual spectra .",
    "table  4 summarizes the features that are identifiable in the averaged spectra in fig .",
    "3 and were discussed in paper i. the equivalent widths of some of weaker features were estimated on the afe(7.7)-normalized spectrum and are given in the last column of table  4 .",
    "the 3.3  feature , which is not apparent in most of the individual galaxy spectra , is easily recognized in the averaged spectrum , and the narrow feature at around 4.03  is probably br@xmath46 .",
    "the hump near 7.0   could be either [ ] 6.99  and/or the 6.9dust feature discussed by bregman et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and cohen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , with possibly a small contribution from h@xmath47 6.910  @xmath48=00 s(5 ) .",
    "the small bump at around 10.6  could arise from [ ] , which is seen most distinctly in the post - starburst galaxy ngc@xmath11569 .",
    "finally , the asymmetric appearance of afe(7.7 ) is probably a result of the blending of two unresolved peaks at 7.6 and 7.8 ; such substructure has been seen in some galactic sources ( e.g. ,  bregman 1989 ; roelfsema et al .",
    "1996 ) , and is partially resolved in some of the highest - s / n spectra in this study ( e.g. ngc@xmath14194 and ic@xmath1883 , see fig .  2 ) .    in order to assess whether the the mir spectral shape varies with star - formation activity , we compared the average spectra for the fir - quiescent and fir - active subsamples defined in  2.1 , which include 14 galaxies each .",
    "the average spectra for the @xmath18-band normalization described above , aligned at _",
    "j _ for comparison , are shown in fig .",
    "4@xmath25 as the solid curve ( fir - quiescent ) and open squares ( fir - active ) .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that both the nir continuum and afes for the fir - active galaxies lie well above those of the fir - quiescent subsample . on the other hand , when the averages are normalized by afe(7.7 ) and aligned at 7.7  ( fig .",
    "4@xmath49 ) , the fir - quiescent spectrum lies above the fir - active one only in the nir region .",
    "( the small difference between the two spectra in fig .",
    "4@xmath49 in the region 910  is significant only at the @xmath50 level . )",
    "note that the apparent `` dips '' around 3.2 , 3.7 and 4.1  seen in fig .",
    "4@xmath49 are probably not real , but are due to the afe(7.7 ) normalization , which yields an overly strong weighting for the ( noisy , and in some cases negative ) short - wavelength data points of galaxies with strong afes and faint nir continua .",
    "these plots demonstrate that the only significant spectral difference between the two subsamples lies in the nir , and can be attributed to different contributions from starlight . in other words ,",
    "the spectral shape of the mir afes in galaxies remains largely independent of star - formation activity .",
    "ngc@xmath1520 ( arp 157 ) , classified as an intermediate - stage merger by hibbard & van gorkom ( 1996 ) , is as radio- and infrared - bright as ngc@xmath14038/4029 ( arp 244 ; the antennae ) .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that ngc@xmath1520 is a merger remnant resulting from two disk galaxies which began colliding about 300 million years ago ( stanford & balcells 1991 ) .",
    "our pht - s aperture was placed on the main optical ridge , @xmath44 @xmath51 north of the emission peak in the 10  image of bushouse , telesco , & werner ( 1998 ) .",
    "this peak is presumably the dust - obscured nucleus of the brighter galaxy in the pair ( see fig .",
    "6 of stanford & balcells 1990 ) .",
    "the pht - s spectrum therefore included both this obscured nucleus and parts of the disks of both galaxies .",
    "the most striking aspect of the spectrum of ngc@xmath1520 is the weakness of afe(8.6 ) and afe(11.3 ) relative to afe(7.7 ) . on the other hand , afe(6.2 )",
    "has normal ( type  a ) strength relative to afe(7.7 ) . in the context of the pah model , both afe(8.6 ) and afe(11.3 )",
    "arise primarily from c - h bending modes , while afe(6.2 ) and afe(7.7 ) come from c - c modes .",
    "thus , a plausible conjecture is that the compression of the ism due to the interaction of the merging galaxy disks might have led to a high degree of dehydrogenation of pahs , resulting in relatively weak 8.6 and 11.3  features .",
    "ngc@xmath11569 is a nearby magellanic - type irregular galaxy with a metallicity @xmath44 30% of solar .",
    "it experienced a strong burst of star formation as recently as a few million years ago ( israel 1988 ; israel & van driel 1990 ; greggio et al .",
    "we obtained pht - s spectra at three positions on the galaxy disk .",
    "position  c ( see table  1 ) is on the nucleus , which also hosts one of the two superluminous young star clusters in this galaxy , cluster b ( ables 1971 ; arp & sandage 1985 ) .",
    "positions nw and se are located ( @xmath52 w , @xmath53 n ) and ( @xmath54 e , @xmath55 s ) of the nucleus respectively .",
    "these correspond respectively to the nw and se peaks on our cam lw2 image ( hunter et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as to regions no .  2 and no .  7 in table  3 of waller ( 1991 ) .",
    "all three spectra show a strong , unresolved emission line at 10.55 ( @xmath56 ) , which presumably is [ ] 10.51 .",
    "we may also have detected [ ] 8.99 , in the nw and se spectra . if present , it is a factor of 510 weaker than [ ] 10.51 , indicating a relatively high effective temperature for the illuminating radiation field ( e.g. ,  rank et al .",

    "2001 ) .",
    "the unusual strength of the ionic lines relative to the dust emission in ngc  1569 carries over to longer wavelengths .",
    "its value of l ( [ ] 88)/ , where l ( [ ] is the luminosity in the [ ] 88  line emission , is higher by an order of magnitude or more ( 1.01.5 dex ) than that of nearly all of the other galaxies in the key project sample ( see fig .",
    "6@xmath25 of malhotra et al .  2001 ) . the only other galaxy with such high - contrast ionic line emission is ic  4662 , for which , unfortunately",
    ", we did not obtain a pht - s spectrum .",
    "recall also that ngc  1569 was an outlier in fig .  1 , having unusually low  for its _ iras _ color index @xmath2 .",
    "whether this is due to the recent starburst or is a consequence of low metallicity is unclear , but the weak dust compared to the gas emission suggests a low dust - to - gas ratio in ngc  1569 , and therefore possibly a high mean free path for far - uv photons as well as a hard uv radiation field .",
    "the pht - s spectrum of ngc@xmath14418 is markedly different from those of nearly all the other sample galaxies : the afes are not seen , and the mir spectrum is dominated by an apparent emission plateau extending from 69 , which has been interpreted as arising from a broad continuum upon which is superposed a deep 10  silicate absorption feature ( roche et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "ngc  4418 was previously noticed to be an extreme object by malhotra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who pointed out its extreme deficiency in the [ ] 157  line .",
    "it is a good example of the now well - established trend , that l ( [ ] 157)/   to  decreases as the fir luminosity and intensity of the dust - heating radiation field increases ( malhotra et al .",
    "1997 ; luhman et al .",
    "the nature of the illuminating radiation field in ngc  4418 is unclear , although its fir color index , @xmath58 , is the highest ( `` warmest '' ) in the full key project sample ( see table  5 of malhotra et al .",

    "1990 ) , so our pht - s spectrum enclosed most ( 84% ) of its mir emission .",

    "2000 ) shows that the emission at 7  arises mainly from the edge - on disk of the galaxy .",
    "our pht - s aperture was centered roughly on the nucleus , and enclosed about 60% of the total flux of the galaxy .",
    "the pht - s spectrum of ngc  5866 shows a strong continuum rising towards shorter wavelengths , consistent with the picture that the global emission from this galaxy is strongly dominated by stellar photospheric emission .",
    "there appears to be a broad emission feature that peaks at 7.9 , instead of the usual afe(7.7 ) feature .",
    "the 8.6  feature is weak , if present , and the 11.3  feature is much wider than usual . taken together , these afes are unusually weak relative to the fir dust emission as compared to the other fir - quiescent galaxies in the sample ( see  4.3 below ) .",
    "spectral synthesis models indicate that as long as the luminosity of a galaxy is dominated by relatively old stellar populations ( i.e. ,  older than a few gyrs ) , the shape of its stellar continuum spectrum in near - infrared remains largely independent of the details of its star formation history ( e.g. ,  bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "this is supported by results from 2mass , which show that normal galaxies display a much smaller color dispersion in the near - infrared than in the optical ( e.g. ,  jarrett 2000 ) .",

    "it is uncertain whether the circumstellar dust emission longward of 8  can also be scaled in this way , but for disk galaxies , the emission is much fainter than the ism emission in this spectral region .",

    "the galaxies are coded according to their degree of fir - activity in the same way as in fig .  1 , and the elliptical galaxies are shown as open circles .",

    ", we used a near - infrared reddening law of @xmath69 , after mathis ( 1990 ) .",
    "we assumed zero reddening for the ellipticals .",
    "the tick marks indicate a@xmath70 = 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath22 respectively , for the dust screen model ; in the star / dust mixed case , one requires about 3 times as much total dust column density in order to produce the same amount of reddening as for the foreground screen .",
    "apart from this scale factor , the two cases produce very similar trends in fig .  5 within the parameter space occupied by our galaxies .",
    "as one can see from the figure , most of the galaxies lie above the reddening lines , particularly in the lower panel , f(4)@xmath68 _ vs_.",
    "@xmath67 . therefore",
    ", it appears that dust reddening can not account for the color differences between our sample of disk galaxies and the reference elliptical galaxies .",

    "we set out to reconstruct the character of this `` nir excess continuum '' as follows .",
    "we assumed that the _ j _ and _ h _ emission in the disk galaxies arises only from stars .",
    "next , we subtracted the averaged elliptical galaxy spectrum in table  3 from the data for each disk galaxy , after reddening it to the @xmath67 color of the latter using the foreground screen case .",
    "( for the few cases where the observed @xmath67 color is slightly bluer than that of the ellipticals , we take a@xmath70 = 0 . ) finally , to increase the s / n ratio , we averaged the residual spectra for the entire galaxy sample . the result is shown in fig .",
    "6@xmath25 . also shown is a modified black - body curve for @xmath71k and a @xmath72 emissivity law , which fits the general shape of the curve quite well .",
    "the emission is clearly much broader and stronger than afe(3.3 ) , and therefore is unlikely to be simply the wings of this feature .    the residual spectrum shown in fig .",
    "6@xmath25 represents a lower limit to the typical intensity of this nir excess continuum , because of our assumption that it does not contribute at h. in order to set an upper limit to such a contribution , we considered the effects of assuming that only the @xmath18-band flux has no contribution from non - stellar sources , and derived the residual spectrum that results from subtracting the elliptical galaxy spectrum uncorrected for different reddening between the disk and e galaxies .",
    "this yields the average residual spectrum shown in fig .  6@xmath49 , which is well fit by a modified black - body curve with @xmath73k and a @xmath72 emissivity , only slightly hotter than the curve in fig .",
    "both approaches therefore indicate that the color temperature of the non - stellar nir continuum is close to @xmath74k .",
    "the fractional energy contained in the nir spectral region is about 10% in fig .",
    "6@xmath25 and about 17% in fig .",
    "6@xmath49 .",
    "next we consider whether the nir excess continuum is correlated with afe emission . in fig .  7",

    "( the two methods of removing the stellar continuum , discussed above , lead to more or less the same 4  fluxes . ) the strength of afe(7.7 ) relative to the @xmath18-band flux increases by nearly an order of magnitude within the sample ( see table  2 ) , as  increases . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no net trend in fig .  7 , indicating that the nir excess correlates strongly with the mir emission for galaxies with a wide range in dust content and luminosity",
    ". we view this as strong evidence that the nir excess continuum originates in the ism , as opposed to being ( scattered ) starlight from late - type stars or circumstellar dust emission .",
    "however , the scatter in fig .  7 is greater than can be accounted for by measurement errors , suggesting that there are some real variations among galaxies in the ratio of the nir excess to afe(7.7 ) .",
    "the most deviant point is the early - type galaxy ngc  5866 , which , as mentioned in  3.2.5 , has very weak afe features .",
    "this non - stellar dust continuum is probably the same component that has been detected in reflection nebulae and the large - scale ism of our own galaxy ( see  1 ) .",
    "in fact , sellgren et al .",
    "( 1985 ) showed that , for the reflection nebulae ngc@xmath17023 and ngc@xmath12023 , the 4  emission surface brightness is between 1/6 to 1/10 of that at the peak of afe(7.7 ) .",
    "this range is quantitatively consistent with our results in fig .",
    "it has been suggested that such a nir continuum might be due to electronic fluorescence or a quasi - continuum of overlapping bands of pah molecules ( e.g. ,  allamandola , tielens , & barker 1989 ) .",
    "while further work is needed in order to determine whether the afes and nir continuum emission arise from exactly the same macromolecules or material , it seems clear that the carriers of these two components are closely related .    in table  5",
    "we summarize the luminosity in the nir region relative to the fir dust emission , for each of the three subsamples defined in  2.1 .",
    "the total nir luminosity is @xmath75 and arises mostly from stellar photospheres .",
    "if we correct for the stellar contribution using the two methods described above , the non - stellar nir continuum contributes @xmath76 for the most quiescent galaxies in our sample , and @xmath77 for the most fir - active ones .",
    "these estimates are on the same order as the _ cobe _ results for our own galaxy ( bernard et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "some variations have been observed among galactic sources in the profiles of the afes ( e.g. ,  roelfsema et al .",

    "2000 ; chan et al .",
    "2001 ) . likewise , while we find similar variations in the afes in our sample of galaxies , we have not found any statistically significant correlation between these variations and , @xmath2 , optical morphology , the 7-to-15  flux density ratio ( dale et al .",
    "2000 ) , or the mean surface brightness at 7 or 15  within an isophotal ellipse containing 50% of the infrared flux .    in fig .",
    "8 we plot the ratios of the strengths of the 6.2 , 8.6 , and 11.3  afes to afe(7.7 ) against  for the 40 galaxies , which all show clearly discerned afes .",
    "we hereafter abbreviate the mean @xmath78 of a feature by its wavelength , e.g. ( 6.2 ) for the mean flux of afe(6.2 ) .",
    "there is some indication of a slight decreasing trend in these plots .",
    "however , these trends are weak and probably not statistically significant .",
    "we computed the median feature strength ratios separately for the fir - quiescent , intermediate , and fir - active subsamples defined in  2.1 .",
    "the values are given in table  6 and plotted as large crosses in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the median values decline by less than 1 @xmath79 from fir - quiescent to fir - active , where @xmath79 is the r.m.s .",
    "dispersion of the entire sample ( see the last row of table  6 ) .",
    "this differs from the conclusion of lu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that the ratio ( 11.3)/(7.7 ) decreases with increasing . that earlier study was based on an older pht - s calibration , but more importantly , the stellar continuum was removed in a more simplistic way , by subtracting a power - law fit to the spectral intervals 3.55  and 9.510.5 .",
    "that procedure had the effect of undersubtracting the continuum underlying the 11.3  feature in galaxies with a strong stellar component , thus producing an apparent trend .",
    "the scatter in fig .",
    "8 is significantly greater than the statistical error bars , implying that there are intrinsic galaxy - to - galaxy variations in the relative feature strengths . according to table  6 , the spread in the afe ratios is @xmath80 for ( 6.2)/(7.7 ) and ( 8.6)/(7.7 ) , and @xmath81 for ( 11.3)/(7.7 ) . within the framework of the pah hypothesis ,",
    "variations in the relative feature strengths have been attributed to the presence of different fractions of pahs that are ionized and/or hydrogenated , as a consequence of differences in the ambient uv radiation field ( e.g. ,  jourdain de muizon et al .  1990 ; de frees et al .",
    "1993 ; schutte et al .  1993 ; langhoff 1996 ) . however , our data suggest that the situation may be more complex than a simple dependence on the uv radiation field .",
    "it is plausible that chemical processing may also play an important role in determining the local abundance and emission properties of the pahs ( e.g. ,  boulanger et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the spectra in fig .",
    "2 also show some galaxy - to - galaxy variations in the afe profiles . in appendix c ,",
    "we quantify one aspect of these variations by defining a `` logarithmic slope '' @xmath82 that measures the steepness of the feature profile on the short- or long - wavelength side .",
    "as we show in table  c1 , the galaxy - to - galaxy variations in @xmath82 range from 1530% for all the afes , except for the short - wavelength side of afe(8.6 ) which shows possibly much greater variations relative to the median value .",
    "this could either be due to intrinsic variations in the profile of afe(8.6 ) , or to a contribution from a weak feature around 8.2  that varies from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "such a shorter - wavelength feature was invoked by verstraete et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to fit high - s / n iso - sws spectra of galactic sources , and an emission feature at @xmath44 8.2  has also been observed in some post - agb stars ( peeters et al .",

    "it was previously known that the afes are depressed in regions ( e.g. ,  csarsky et al .  1996 ) .",
    "this has been widely attributed to the preferential destruction of the small afe carriers relative to larger dust grains in these regions .",
    "_ iras _ data also indicate an afe depression over galaxy scales , with the afes being more severely depressed in galaxies with warmer @xmath2 colors ( helou , ryter , & soifer 1991 ) .",

    "we indicate galaxies with values of @xmath84 ( for which the aperture correction is large and therefore less certain ) by filled symbols , in order to distinguish them from the others ( open symbols ) .",
    "for some of these galaxies , malhotra et al .",
    "( 2001 , table  c1 ) have derived @xmath85 , the intensity of the far - uv interstellar radiation field in units of the radiation field in the solar neighborhood , based on a pdr model that depends on the observed fluxes in [ ] 158  and [ ] 63and the flux of the total infrared emission .",
    "these galaxies are plotted as squares of three different sizes , where the smallest corresponds to @xmath86 , the intermediate size to @xmath87 , and the largest to @xmath88 .    for comparison , we also show in fig .",
    "9 the _ iras _ results of werner , gautier , & cawlfield ( 1994 ) for multiple spatial positions in two galactic regions , the rosette and california nebulae ( indicated by a dashed line ) , and the reflection nebula in the pleiades ( indicated by a solid line ) .",
    "these lines actually represent the logarithmic ratio of the _ iras _ 12  flux ( assumed to be proportional to our integrated afe flux ) to the fir flux , and are shifted vertically in order to bracket most of the galaxy data points .",
    "the average trend of our galaxy points is steeper than that characteristic of the reflection nebula , but shallower than the trend for the regions .",
    "this comparison suggests that both regions and reflection nebulae contribute to the total afe and fir emission of galaxies .",
    "in table  7 we list median ratios of several different measures of the afe overall intensity to the fir flux , for the three subsamples .",
    "it can be seen from the table that the depression of afes relative to the fir emission becomes significant only for the most fir - active subsample ; for the latter galaxies , /  has a value only 60%  that of the other two subsamples .",
    "furthermore , from fig .  9 it can be seen that this afe depression is more related to the hardness than the intensity of the radiation field : at a given @xmath2 , galaxies with higher values of @xmath85 tend to lie closer to the dashed line .",
    "since the flux ratio of [ ] to the afes has very little dispersion in this sample of galaxies ( helou et al .",
    "2001 ) , one does expect such a linkage between the diagnostics based on the fine - structure lines and the afes . however , this is unlikely just a mathematical linkage , for the two reference lines in fig .",
    "9 clearly suggest that the ( uv - hard ) hii regions have a lower /  than the ( uv - soft ) reflection nebulae at any given @xmath2 .",
    "if the photodestruction process that weakens the afes in galactic regions is also responsible for depressing the afe emission on galaxy scales , our results imply that the mass spectrum of the dust particles could differ significantly between quiescent and starburst galaxies .",
    "as shown in  3.1 , the mir emission from disk galaxies is dominated by strong afe emission over a wide range in such physical characteristics as the intensity of the interstellar uv radiation field , fir luminosity , and temperature of the fir - emitting dust .",
    "the few exceptions we find may be indicative of the extreme conditions required for the afes to fade from view . representing the high - radiation - field limit , we have objects such as ngc  4418 ( which may be an agn ) , ic  860 , and ngc  1569 ( which , if plotted in fig .  9 despite its small value for @xmath27 , would lie near the position of ic  860 ) . for these objects",
    ", it is reasonable to explain the weakness of the afes as being the consequence of destruction of the afe carriers by hard uv photons ( or shocks ) , by analogy with the galactic sources discussed above .",
    "it is less clear what causes the deficiency in afe emission in the fir - quiescent galaxy ngc  5866 .",
    "this is the earliest type galaxy in key project sample for which we have a pht - s spectrum ; unfortunately , we did not obtain pht - s observations for the other three e / s0 galaxies in our program ( malhotra et al .",
    "the lack of strong afe emission in ngc  5866 could be due either to an actual deficiency of the afe carriers or to a lack of energetic uv photons capable of exciting the features , or both .",
    "note that our lws observations of the [ ] 158  and [ ] 63 lines indicate a particularly weak and soft uv radiation field in this galaxy ( malhotra et al .",
    "we present new _ iso _ pht - s spectra ( 2.511.6 ) , extended to 1.25  using _ jhk _ data from the 2mass survey , for a sample of 45 disk galaxies that span the typical range in global properties of galaxies energetically dominated by star formation .",
    "pht - s aperture coverage factors are also provided for most of the galaxies .",
    "we decompose the spectra into three constituents : ( 1 ) stellar continuum emission , which dominates at the shortest wavelengths ( 2.54.9 ; nir ) ; ( 2 ) a weaker and redder nir `` excess continuum '' ; and ( 3 ) the well - known aromatic dust emission features ( afes ) at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3 which dominate the long - wavelength half of the pht - s spectra ( 5.811.6 ; mir ) .",
    "most of the galaxy spectra appear similar to each other , especially in the mir region , and to an averaged `` template '' spectrum shown in fig .",
    "the most striking exceptions are ngc@xmath14418 , which shows no afes but instead has a broad mid - infrared continuum upon which is superposed a strong 10  silicate absorption feature ; and ngc@xmath11569 , which has a very weak infrared continuum but an unusually strong [ ] 10.5  line from ionized gas .",
    "the non - stellar nir excess continuum has an average color temperature of @xmath0k and a luminosity of a few percent of , where  is the far - infrared ( 40120 ) luminosity attributed to large dust grains .",
    "this nir continuum scales more or less linearly with the strength of the afes , suggesting that the nir excess continuum originates in the ism of galaxies ( and not , for example , in late - type stars or circumstellar dust ) ; and that the afes and nir excess continuum arise from similar carriers .",
    "the profiles and relative strengths of the afes in the disk galaxies match those of `` type a '' mid - infrared spectra , by far the most predominant type of mid - infrared dust emission pattern in the ism of our own galaxy .",

    "we interpret this as indicating that other factors , in addition to the present - day radiation field , affect the strengths and shapes of the afes .",
    "the ratios of both the afes and non - stellar nir continuum to the fir flux decrease systematically from the most quiescent galaxies to the most actively star - forming galaxies in the sample .",
    "we show that this is more related to the hardness than the intensity of the heating radiation field , likely a result of the afe / nir carriers being preferentially destroyed , relative to the larger dust grains responsible for the fir emission , in regions of active star formation and intense uv radiation fields .",

    "for each afe , we define a `` logarithmic slope '' parameter @xmath82 that measures the steepness of the feature profile on the short or long- wavelength side , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the flux density of the detector pixel nearest the peak of the emission feature in the rest - frame , and @xmath109 is the flux density of a detector pixel down one side of the feature . for @xmath108 we used the pixel corresponding to 6.216  in table  3 for afe(6.2 ) , 7.616  for afe(7.7 ) , 8.540  for afe(8.6 ) and 11.263  for afe(11.3 ) . for simplicity",
    "we chose @xmath109 at one of the detector pixels that was used to define the wavelength range of the feature ( see table  2 ) .",
    "two slopes can be defined for each afe , @xmath110 for the short - wavelength side and @xmath111 for the long - wavelength side , except for afe(11.3 ) , for which only @xmath112 can be defined .    in table",

    "( 3 ) to ( 4 ) can be used to gauge whether this is significant .",
    "the ratio of cols .",
    "( 3 ) to ( 2 ) ranges from @xmath44 1530% for both slopes of afe(6.2 ) and afe(7.7 ) and for @xmath114 , to 40% for @xmath112 , to 130% for @xmath115 .",

    "<S> the galaxies were selected to span the range in global properties of normal , star - forming disk galaxies in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra can be decomposed into three spectral components : ( 1 ) continuum emission from stellar photospheres , which dominates the near - infrared ( 2.54.9 ; nir ) spectral region ; ( 2 ) a weak nir excess continuum , which has a color temperature of @xmath0k , carries a luminosity of a few percent of the total far - infrared dust luminosity , and most likely arises from the ism ; and ( 3 ) the well - known broad emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3 , which are generally attributed to aromatic carbon particles . </S>",
    "<S> these aromatic features in emission ( afes ) dominate the mid - infrared ( 5.811.6 ; mir ) part of the spectrum , and resemble the so - called type - a spectra observed in many non - stellar sources and the diffuse ism in our own galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the few notable exceptions include ngc@xmath14418 , where a dust continuum replaces the afes in mir , and ngc@xmath11569 , where the afes are weak and the strongest emission feature is [ ] 10.51 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relative strengths of the afes vary by 1525% among the galaxies . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the nir excess continuum and afe emission are correlated , suggesting that they are produced by similar mechanisms and similar ( or the same ) material . on the other hand , as the current star - formation activity increases , the overall strengths of the afes and the nir excess continuum drop significantly with respect to that of the far - infrared emission from large dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the summed luminosity of the afes falls from @xmath3  for the most `` ir - quiescent '' galaxies to @xmath4  for the most `` ir - active '' galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely a consequence of the preferential destruction in intense radiation fields of the small carriers responsible for the nir / afe emission . </S>"
