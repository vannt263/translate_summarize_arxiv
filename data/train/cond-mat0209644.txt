    "shortly after the seminal work of imry and ma@xcite on the effects of random fields in ferromagnets , it was pointed out by halperin and varma@xcite that similar ideas could be used to understand the effects of atomic disorder in perovskite ferroelectrics .",
    "halperin and varma showed that atomic disorder which coupled linearly to the ferroelectric order parameter behaved in an equivalent fashion to the random field in a ferromagnet , and thus could cause the ferroelectric phase transition to become smeared .",
    "they seem to have been unaware , however , that ferroelectrics displaying such smeared transitions had been discovered long before.@xcite these materials , now called relaxor ferroelectrics , were originally referred to as ferroelectrics with diffuse phase transitions .",
    "the random - field ideas of halperin and varma did not immediately become popular in the field . in the 1984 review of isupov@xcite the diffuse phase transitions were modeled using only random - bond disorder .",
    "however , by the early 1990 s it was generally recognized that random - bond disorder was not enough to explain all of the observed effects , and models including both random bonds and random fields became widely used.@xcite until now it has been assumed@xcite that in the presence of a strong cubic crystal - field anisotropy one could treat the different ising components independently . in this work we will show that for a certain type of random field new phenomena occur which can not be understood without including coupling between the components .",
    "the identification of relaxor ferroelectrics as a broad class of materials in which electric dipoles behave in a manner analogous in many respects to the magnetic dipoles in spin - glasses was made forcefully by burns and dacol,@xcite who generalized and extended ideas of courtens.@xcite it is essential , however , to note that , as shown by halperin and varma,@xcite in the case of electric dipoles it is almost inevitable that the disorder which is an essential feature of these materials will produce random fields .",
    "the presence of these random fields limits the development of long - range spin - glass order in three dimensions.@xcite therefore , it is not expected that the glassy behavior which is seen in the disordered electric dipole materials represents a true phase transition into a state with long - range spin - glass - type order .",
    "we would like to study the development of spatial correlations among the electric dipoles . in order to do this",
    ", we will work with a model which does not retain all of the atomic details . in the model studied here , we crudely represent each perovskite unit cell by only one dynamical variable .",
    "we will refer to this variable as a spin , although it actually represents atomic displacements in the unit cell .",
    "the model includes a cubic crystal anisotropy , a nearest - neighbor two - spin interaction , and a random field .",
    "as discussed by pirc and blinc,@xcite if we assume that the cubic crystal anisotropy is so strong that each spin points along one of the [ 111 ] directions and the random field is represented by a simple vector coupling linearly to the spin , then the different components of the spin act independently.@xcite thus the model reduces to a set of decoupled random - field ising models .",
    "we may also include randomness in the bonds .",
    "( to perform this decoupling on eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we use a coordinate system rotated by 45@xmath6 . )",
    "this model has been studied in detail over a number of years .",
    "it is believed to be generally well - understood , although there remains some controversy about the values of the critical exponents.@xcite    similar models have been studied in which the spin components do not act independently . then the behavior does not reduce to that of an ising model . for example , there are the three - state potts model with a random field,@xcite and the four - state potts model with a random field,@xcite which are still qualitatively similar to the random - field ising model .",
    "when the random field becomes strong enough , the ground state of the system breaks up into imry - ma domains , and the long - range order is destroyed .",
    "there is also the cubic model with random anisotropy,@xcite which , when the randomness is strong , shows a new type of domain phase with long - range order .",
    "this phase may be thought of as one in which each of the spin components orders independently , but different parts of the lattice are dominated by different components .",
    "thus , in this phase , there is a network of 90@xmath6 domain walls embedded in the ordered phase .",
    "a somewhat similar domain state was found by kartha , castan , krumhansl and sethna@xcite in a model of shape - memory alloys .",
    "the existence of such a domain state with long - range order has been proposed@xcite as the explanation of relaxor ferroelectric behavior .",
    "further , egami@xcite has emphasized that the network of 90@xmath6 domain walls is probably an essential element leading to the large piezoelectric response of relaxor ferroelectrics .",
    "therefore , we would like to study a random - field model which has such a phase .",
    "the simplest model which has the desired properties is a four - state vector potts model ( four - state clock model ) with a random potts field , on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is @xmath7 each spin @xmath8 is a dynamical variable which has four allowed states : ( 1,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) , ( -1,0 ) and ( 0,-1 ) .",
    "each @xmath9 is an independent quenched random variable which assumes one of these four allowed states with equal probability .",
    "the @xmath10 indicates a sum over nearest neighbors of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the extension to three - component spins is conceptually straightforward , but will not be discussed in detail here .",
    "the sign of @xmath11 is chosen so that for large positive values the probability of spin @xmath8 in state @xmath12 is strongly suppressed .",
    "density - functional calculations for a typical relaxor ferroelectric alloy@xcite have shown that the most significant interactions created by the alloy disorder are repulsive and short - ranged .",
    "thus we believe that this is a reasonable first approximation to the interactions produced by the disorder .",
    "when @xmath11 is negative , the random potts field favors one state on each site , just as a vector field would . in that case",
    "there is no qualitative difference between the random potts field and the random vector field.@xcite thus we will not present any calculations for negative @xmath11 here .    when @xmath11 is large and positive , we can approximate the random field term as a projection operator which forbids @xmath8 from occupying the state @xmath12 .",
    "then within mean - field theory it becomes simple to calculate the approximate ground states .",
    "there are eight of these mean - field ground states .",
    "for example , in one such ground state 75% of the spins are in state ( 1,0 ) , and the other 25% of the spins , which are prevented from being in this spin state by their local @xmath12 are in state ( 0,-1 ) .",
    "the energy of this state for a simple cubic lattice is easily calculated to be @xmath13 per spin .",
    "additional details of the mean - field theory are discussed in the appendix .",
    "as we will see , the energies of the ground states found by computer calculation are less than @xmath14 , and they differ qualitatively from the mean - field ground states .",
    "the problem with the mean - field ground states is easy to understand .",
    "if we consider the above example , on a simple cubic lattice the 25% of spins in the state ( 0,-1 ) are broken up into finite clusters .",
    "if we move all of the spins in such a finite cluster into the state ( 0,1 ) , the total energy does not change .",
    "one might expect , therefore , that for large @xmath11 , the long - range order in the ground state would still be along one of the four [ 1,0 ] directions , since the 25% of the spins in the finite clusters should not be able to exhibit long - range order .",
    "however , a true ground state on the simple cubic lattice actually has a very different structure .",
    "it turns out to be possible to find states with , for example , 50% of the spins in state ( 1,0 ) and 50% of the spins in state ( 0,-1 ) which have a much lower energy than the mean - field ground states . as we will show , to find states which look like the true ground states for large @xmath11 within mean - field theory , we need to add another term to eq .",
    ".    the author finds it helpful to compare the model studied here to the results for the three dimensional ashkin - teller model,@xcite whose hamiltonian is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are ising variables .",
    "( note that our notation and normalization differ from those of ditzian _",
    "et al._@xcite )    each of the three linearly independent components of a random field of a four - state model can now be identified with one of the terms of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and thus one of the mean - field order parameters . expressing the random - field term using the @xmath18 and @xmath19 variables , and adding it to eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we get @xmath20   \\ , .\\ ] ] if we set @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then eq .  ( 3 ) becomes just eq .",
    "( 1 ) expressed in the coordinate system defined by @xmath23 and @xmath19 .",
    "if we then set @xmath24 , the random potts field term is replaced by the usual random vector field term .    in a real alloy",
    "we would not expect that exactly one of the local states was blocked on each site .",
    "instead , we would expect to find a random distribution , with some sites having no blocked states , some with one blocked state , etc .",
    "it would be straightforward to generalize the random field term to allow this , by letting @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) become a function of _",
    "i_. for example , we could use a probability distribution for @xmath26 which had weight at @xmath27 .",
    "such a generalization is likely to be useful in modeling the properties of specific alloy systems .",
    "however , a more general model has more parameters .",
    "exploring its entire parameter space would be tedious , and seems premature at this time .",
    "if @xmath28 is chosen to be an integer , then the energy of any state is an integer multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "then it becomes straightforward to design a heat bath monte carlo computer program to study eq .",
    "( 1 ) which uses integer arithmetic for the energies , and a look - up table to calculate boltzmann factors .",
    "this substantially improves the performance of the computer program , and was used for all the calculations reported here .",
    "( if desired , one could do almost as well for half - integer values of @xmath29 . )",
    "lattices with periodic boundary conditions were used throughout .",
    "two different linear congruential random number generators were used : one to choose the random @xmath12 and one to choose the boltzmann factors for the monte carlo spin flips .",
    "a series of @xmath30 samples of various lattice sizes and values of @xmath11 was studied to map out the phase diagram , which is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for @xmath31 the behavior of the random potts field model remains generally similar to the behavior of the random vector field model . at low temperature",
    "the system develops long - range order , with the order parameter aligned along one of the spin - coordinate axes .",
    "it is not required , however , that the critical exponents for the phase transition here will be those of the random - field ising model , as happens for the vector random - field case .",
    "the @xmath32 phase found by ditzian , banavar , grest and kadanoff@xcite has many of the features of the domain fe phase which we find in our model for large @xmath11 and low @xmath33 . the @xmath32 phase of eq .  2 only occurs for @xmath34 .",
    "this indicates that one of the effects of the random potts field in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is to generate a negative effective value of the @xmath35 coupling .",
    "this effect was also seen in the random - anisotropy cubic model.@xcite it is the random - anisotropy part ( the @xmath25 term of eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) which generates the @xmath35 effective coupling under rescaling , and prevents the decoupling of eq .",
    "( 1 ) into two ising models . if we want to study a mean - field theory for eq .",
    "( 1 ) we should include a @xmath35 term , thus arriving at eq .",
    "the effective value of @xmath35 will depend on @xmath11 . in this way we can obtain a mean - field theory which reproduces the phase diagram of fig .  1 .",
    "a necessary condition for the existence of stable long - range [ 1,1 ] domain fe order is that there be infinite connected clusters of both of the two dominant spin states .",
    "since it becomes impossible to fulfill this condition when the amount of long - range order is small , the transition from the domain fe phase to the paraelectric phase must be first order .",
    "this , however , is specific to our model with only first neighbor interactions on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "it is possible that this phase transition could become continuous if , for example , second neighbor exchange is included in the hamiltonian .    as discussed by ditzian _",
    "et al._@xcite , even in the absence of randomness the details of what happens as we move from the @xmath32 phase to the baxter phase are not clear",
    ". there may be a small area in the region of the [ 1,0 ] fe to [ 1,1 ] domain fe phase boundary in which an intermediate phase is stable .",
    "this would be similar to the intermediate phase which has recently been found experimentally.@xcite we have indicated the uncertainty about what is going on in this region of the phase diagram by the question mark in fig .  1 .",
    "a generalization of the @xmath32 phase also exists for the three - component ashkin - teller model in three dimensions.@xcite    the dotted line in fig .",
    "1 represents the approximate location of the onset of thermal hysteresis . above the dotted line",
    ", the system will quickly relax to a state which is independent of initial conditions , but below this line the system retains a memory of initial conditions for a long time .",
    "this line does not represent any true thermodynamic singularity .",
    "its precise location depends somewhat on the size of @xmath36 and the length of the monte carlo runs .",
    "thus the dotted line should be identified as the glass temperature , @xmath37 . for small values of @xmath36",
    "the system can develop order on the scale of @xmath36 above @xmath37 . for @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "it is not possible to find the ground states in a reasonable time by cooling the system from high temperature .",
    "in fig .  2 we display the specific heat for eq .",
    "( 1 ) using four different values of @xmath11 .",
    "these curves were calculated by numerically differentiating and averaging monte carlo data for the energy of runs for four @xmath38 lattices for each value of @xmath11 , starting at high temperature and cooling slowly . for each run , the temperature was changed in steps of @xmath40 .",
    "40,960 monte carlo passes through the lattice were performed at each value of @xmath33 , with data being collected after each 20 passes .",
    "the first 248 data points at each temperature were discarded , and the remaining 1,800 data points were averaged .",
    "a similar procedure was used for heating runs .",
    "note that for @xmath41 ( not displayed ) , the specific heat for eq .",
    "( 1 ) reduces to a that of an ordinary ising model on the simple cubic lattice , with @xmath42 .",
    "this model has a very sharp singularity at @xmath43 , whose height diverges to infinity with @xmath36 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "2 that as @xmath11 increases , the peak in the specific heat broadens and shifts to lower energy , with approximately half of the change occurring by @xmath44 . by comparing with fig .",
    "1 , it is seen that for @xmath45 the peak in the specific heat is centered above the region of glassy behavior .",
    "the average heights and widths of the peaks shown in fig .  2 are essentially the same for @xmath46 ( not shown ) as for @xmath38 .",
    "as one would expect , there is more variation from sample to sample for the smaller lattices .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare data from the cooling runs with @xmath47 with heating runs on the same lattices .",
    "the initial condition for each heating run was a state with long - range order .",
    "the temperature at which the long - range order collapses is identified as @xmath37 .",
    "we see that below @xmath48 there is a region of @xmath33 where the specific heat is slightly higher for the cold - start sample .",
    "the crossing of the two curves near @xmath49 gives us a crude estimate for the ordering temperature @xmath43 .",
    "it is often possible to estimate @xmath43 for a first - order phase transition with high precision . in order to do this with a computer simulation , however , it is necessary to run the simulation close to @xmath43 , with @xmath36 larger than the correlation length , for a time which is long enough so that the sample can spontaneously order and disorder several times .",
    "we are far from being able to satisfy that condition here , due to the glassy dynamics for @xmath50 .",
    "the integrated area between the cooling curve data and the heating curve data gives us an estimate of the value of the latent heat at @xmath43 .",
    "we can also look directly at the difference in energy between the heating run and the cooling run at @xmath51 .",
    "thus we find that the latent is about @xmath52 .",
    "the fact that the slope of the heating curve is so similar to that of the cooling curve and the latent heat at @xmath43 is so small indicates that there is very little difference in the local structure of this model between the ordered states of the [ 1,1 ] domain ferroelectric phase and the metastable states which are found by slow cooling .",
    "a small latent heat is a natural consequence of a large ( but finite ) correlation length at @xmath43 .",
    "in order to obtain information about the two - spin correlations , we calculate the angle - averaged structure factor @xmath4 . in fig .  4 we display a log - log plot of @xmath4 , obtained by averaging over the data from the cooling runs for the @xmath38 lattices , as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "we see that for all these values of @xmath39 , the qualitative behavior of a sample cooled from high @xmath33 without any external ordering field is the same . as we lower",
    "@xmath33 , the peak near @xmath54 first grows and then saturates .",
    "the rate of growth of this peak is maximal at the temperature where the specific heat has its maximum . as @xmath11 decreases , the height of the peak and the value of the correlation length increase . for @xmath44 , the correlation length at low",
    "@xmath33 becomes larger than our sample size .",
    "however , these zero - field - cooled samples never show true long - range order . with true long - range order , the size of the small-@xmath5 peak would decrease as @xmath33 decreases below @xmath43 , because the intensity in the long - range - order @xmath55-function will not appear on the log - log plot .    in fig",
    "5 we show data for @xmath4 from the heating runs , where the samples begin in an ordered state . under these conditions ,",
    "the size of the small-@xmath5 peak continues to grow as @xmath33 is increased above @xmath43 , until @xmath33 reaches @xmath37 and the sample can equilibrate . in fig .",
    "5(c ) we show data from runs which are ten times longer than the standard runs .",
    "the @xmath56 samples are able to equilibrate at @xmath57 during the long run ( _ i.e. _ they become indistinguishable from the data from the corresponding cooling run ) , but the changes at @xmath58 are small . by @xmath59 increasing the length of the run by a factor of ten has a negligible effect on the observed state of the sample .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it turned out to be possible to find approximate ground states of the @xmath60 samples by a simulated annealing procedure . in fig .  6 we show @xmath4 for the approximate ground states of the @xmath38 lattices with @xmath61 , averaging over each of the four [ 1,1 ] directions for each of the four samples .",
    "the data shown in the figure are fit quite well with by a lorentzian line shape , with a correlation length of about 10 lattice units .",
    "this diffuse - scattering part of @xmath4 contains about 54% of the spectral weight .",
    "the other 46% of the weight is in the @xmath55-function at @xmath54 , which is due to the long - range [ 1,1 ] order .",
    "what this means in detail is that for large @xmath11 a ground state contains approximately 49% each of the two majority spin states , and about 1% each of the two minority states .",
    "the energy per spin of the lowest ground states found for each sample was about @xmath62 , with the energies of the `` ground states '' of the same sample in the other three [ 1,1 ] directions lying typically about @xmath63 higher .",
    "since @xmath38 is large compared to a correlation length of 10 , this result for the ground state energy should represent the large @xmath36 limit , while the differences in energies between alternate ground state directions of the same sample should scale like @xmath64 .",
    "note that these actual ground state energies are substantially below the energy of the simple mean - field ground state of the @xmath60 model .    for @xmath38 and @xmath60",
    "the energy of a zero - field - cooled state at @xmath65 , which has no long - range order , is only about @xmath52 higher than the energy of a true ground state .",
    "thus for lattices smaller than about @xmath46 the energy differences between the ground states of different [ 1,1 ] directions become larger than the energy difference between a zero - field - cooled state and a true ground state . under these conditions",
    "the zero - field - cooled sample is able to reach a long - range - ordered state .",
    "the zero - field - cooled @xmath38 samples can be decomposed into domains of different [ 1,1 ] ground states , with 90@xmath6 walls between the domains .",
    "the probabilities of having effective fields of magnitude 6 , 5 , ... and 0 in a ground state , averaged over the four ground states for each of these @xmath38 @xmath60 samples are 0.1121 , 0.2780 , 0.3148 , 0.1685 , 0.0751 , 0.0383 , and 0.0131 , respectively .",
    "thus , in a ground state only about one spin in nine is surrounded by fully aligned nearest neighbors .",
    "more than 1% of the spins are in zero effective field .",
    "some of the spins can flip freely between two positions in a ground state with no cost in energy .",
    "since the spins in this model are discrete and two - dimensional , being in zero effective field is not a necessary condition for a spin to be `` free '' in this way .",
    "the bulk of these free spins are flipping between the two majority spin states for that particular ground state .",
    "it is easy to find that the fraction of free spins in a particular ground state is about 6.5% .",
    "however , a spin which is not free in one ground state may become free by the flipping of other free spins .",
    "the fraction of spins which can become free by the flipping of other free spins , one at a time , is 11.9% . since 0.119",
    "is much less than the critical concentration for uncorrelated site percolation on a simple cubic lattice , it is not surprising that a set of free spins defined in this way consists of small isolated clusters .",
    "the probability that a free spin may occupy all three of its allowed spin states with no energy cost is negligible to this level of accuracy . thus a lower bound on the ground state entropy per spin for large @xmath11 is @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is an upper bound .",
    "calculating the ground state entropy of this model is a complex problem , because it requires finding all of the ground states .",
    "thus each of the four `` [ 1,1 ] ground states '' of a sample is actually a cluster of ground states in the phase space of the model .",
    "the simulated annealing procedure works because , if we use one of the simple mean - field ground states , which has 75% of the spins in one spin state and 25% of the spins in a second spin state , as an initial condition , the direction of the order parameter will rapidly relax to the closest of the [ 1,1 ] energy minima , even at temperatures well below @xmath43 .",
    "the fact that this is possible is partly due to the large number of spin rearrangements which can be made with no energy cost .",
    "this prevents the system from being easily trapped in a metastable minimum of the free energy which is close to the initial mean - field ground state .",
    "although a ground state energy of @xmath68 means that about 33% of nearest neighbor spin pairs are oriented at 90@xmath6 from one another , the fraction of nearest neighbor spin pairs which are pointing in opposite directions in one of these ground states is only 0.00011 .",
    "the small number of spins in the minority states exist in compact blobs whose diameter is approximately the correlation length of 10 lattice units .    for @xmath28 = 3 ,",
    "every sample studied had four ground states , each one fully aligned along one of the four [ 1,0 ] spin states .",
    "there is an exponentially small probability of having an unusual local configuration of the @xmath12 which would misalign a small cluster of spins in a ground state , but this was never observed .",
    "thus , ignoring the statistical fluctuations in the sample average of @xmath12 , the ground state energy in the [ 1,0 ] ferroelectric phase is found to be @xmath69 . the value of @xmath70 for any value of @xmath11 can not be greater than @xmath68 , its value for @xmath71 . from this",
    "we expect that the boundary between the [ 1,0 ] phase and the [ 1,1 ] domain phase should be at @xmath28 slightly less than 4 , as observed .",
    "in the past , various kinds of evidence have been presented to argue that relaxor ferroelectrics represent a distinct class of materials , and are not merely the inevitable consequence of adding some alloy disorder to any ferroelectric .",
    "de yoreo , pohl and burns@xcite studied the low - temperature properties of a variety of ferroelectric alloys , and found that they could be separated into two classes .",
    "relaxor ferroelectrics showed glassy low temperature behavior and normal ferroelectrics did not , even when the normal ferroelectrics were random alloys .",
    "recently , viehland _",
    "et al._@xcite have argued that in some materials they find a well - defined transition between a normal ferroelectric phase and a relaxor ferroelectric phase .",
    "it would be remarkable if the low temperature thermal properties of such a crystal could be switched from glassy behavior to crystalline behavior by poling the sample . to the author s knowledge",
    ", this experiment has not yet been tried .",
    "for the two - spin exchange interaction of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , a 180@xmath6 domain wall has twice the energy of a 90@xmath6 domain wall . as a result of this ,",
    "180@xmath6 domain walls become rare at low temperature in this model . as pointed out by brgel ,",
    "kleemann and bianchi,@xcite ferroelastic interactions raise the energy of 90@xmath6 walls , but do not have much effect on the energy of 180@xmath6 walls .    to incorporate this effect into our model",
    ", we would add a biquadratic term to eq .",
    "( 1 ) of the form @xmath72 .",
    "when @xmath73 becomes large , the structure of the domain state will change,@xcite because 180@xmath6 domain walls now have a lower energy than 90@xmath6 domain walls .",
    "it is difficult to study this brgel , kleemann , bianchi domain state with computer simulations if the size of a ferroelastic domain is large . a sample which is the size of a single ferroelastic domain ( or smaller )",
    "will behave essentially as a random - field ising model .",
    "in this work we have used monte carlo computer simulations to study a simple model of a ferroelectric alloy . in this model",
    ", the alloy disorder causes some of the positions of the polarizable ions to be strongly disfavored .",
    "we have found that this model displays a type of ferroelectric domain phase which does not exist in the model of pirc and blinc.@xcite this phase may be thought of as resulting from the addition of a random field to the @xmath32 phase@xcite of an ashkin - teller model .",
    "it seems likely that this model , and some natural generalizations of it , will help in the understanding of relaxor ferroelectric behavior .",
    "the presence of the random field greatly complicates the mean - field theory for eq .",
    "it is necessary to distinguish the four classes of spins corresponding to the four different allowed values of @xmath74 .",
    "label the four directions ( 1,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) , ( -1,0 ) and ( 0,-1 ) as direction 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , respectively . define @xmath75 to be the probability that a spin of class @xmath76 points in the @xmath77 direction .",
    "then @xmath78 for any @xmath76 .",
    "but , in the general case , we have to deal with twelve independent variables in the mean - field theory .",
    "if we take the limit that @xmath79 becomes infinite , there are only eight independent variables , because we can then set @xmath75 to 0 when @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 be the number of neighbors of any spin .",
    "then the mean - field expression for the energy per spin is @xmath82 in addition to the usual factor of 1/2 to avoid double - counting , there is factor of 1/16 arising from the assumption that each value of @xmath76 ( _ i.e. _ each @xmath74 ) is equally weighted .",
    "the entropy per spin is @xmath83 and the free energy is , as usual , @xmath84 .",
