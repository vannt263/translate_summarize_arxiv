    "<S> the bec is well suited for this purpose because the absence of thermal motion allows for long storage times , the large optical depth allows for high write - read efficiencies , and excellent internal - state preparation allows for high - fidelity storage of a qubit in atomic spin states . </S>",

    "<S> the atomic spin state is @xmath5 with hyperfine quantum numbers @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the single - photon pulse is controlled by the shape of the trigger laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> it is chosen such that the total duration of a single - photon pulse is @xmath7 @xmath0s ( full width at half maximum : @xmath8 @xmath0s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the emitted photons exhibit sub - poissonian statistics with @xmath9 .    the photon is transported in a 30 meter long optical fiber to a different laboratory , where it is absorbed in an @xmath1rb bec using raman transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this eit - type scheme converts the single photon into a single magnon , which is a quasi - particle of a collective spin - wave excitation in the bec . </S>",
    "<S> the single magnon is described by the state vector @xmath10 where @xmath11 describes the state of the @xmath12-th atom in the bec and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are spatial wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 are the hyperfine quantum numbers of the atom that underwent the raman transfer . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the bec atom number . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization - qubit states @xmath3 and @xmath4 are mapped onto the magnon states @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes the entangled atom - bec state @xmath17 all atoms in the bec participate in the collective excitation , so that the single atom is entangled with an enormous number of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the bec serves as a quantum memory for one particle of an einstein - podolsky - rosen pair @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement is shared between two stand - alone experiments in different laboratories , with a physical separation of 13 m between the bec and the single atom . </S>",
    "<S> interfacing these two different atomic systems poses many experimental challenges . </S>",
    "<S> for example , optimizing the performance of each subsystem produces quite different values for the optimal light frequency , both on a coarse scale of @xmath18 line versus @xmath19 line and on a fine scale of tens of mhz . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , loading of a single atom must be synchronized with the production of a bec and many write - read cycles must be performed on each bec , to achieve sufficient average count rates . the large number of write - read cycles reduces the bec atom number and along with it the average write - read efficiency .    in searching for the optimal photon wavelength , </S>",
    "<S> one challenge is off - resonant photoassociation driven by the eit control laser because it gradually reduces the bec atom number @xmath15 . for @xmath20 write - read cycles per bec </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath15 drops from @xmath21 to @xmath22 when operating near the atomic @xmath18 line at @xmath23 nm . in principle , working at the @xmath19 line at @xmath24 nm would be favorable , because here larger dipole matrix elements would result in larger optical depth of the bec as well as higher efficiency @xmath25 of the single - photon generation in the cavity . in practice , however , the photoassociation rates are much higher at 780 nm , causing the atom number to decay 50 times faster . </S>",
    "<S> this forces us to work at 795 nm . </S>",
    "<S> for laser pulses at 795 nm , we still achieve a write - read efficiency of @xmath26 in the bec , exceeding the 48% reported previously @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the eit control photons scattered off the bec pose another problem , namely that a noticeable fraction of them reaches the photo detectors , producing such a large background that detecting the entanglement becomes impossible . </S>",
    "<S> we solve this problem by placing the photo detectors behind a single - mode fiber for transverse mode filtering and a filter cavity with a finesse of 180 for spectral filtering . </S>",
    "<S> the light retrieved from the bec is so well collimated that we manage to couple @xmath27 of it into the single - mode fiber .    </S>",
    "<S> yet another challenge arises from the fact that the optical dipole trap which holds the single atom inside the cavity shifts the atomic resonance by 130 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> attempting to store photons at this shifted frequency would reduce the bec write - read efficiency @xmath28 . by tuning the trigger laser and the cavity , we produce photons with a blue detuning of 70 mhz relative to the free - space resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is a tradeoff between reduced production efficiency @xmath25 and reduced bec write - read efficiency @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the production efficiency @xmath25 is @xmath29 on resonance with the @xmath19 line , exceeding previous results in a similar system @xcite by a factor of 6 . </S>",
    "<S> operation at 70 mhz detuning from the @xmath18 line reduces @xmath25 to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the bec write - read efficiency is reduced to @xmath31 for laser pulses and to @xmath32 for single photons . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of these two values for @xmath28 shows that possible noise on the carrier phase of the single - photon pulse is low enough to have negligible effect on @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we typically observe @xmath33 coincidences per experimental shot . for further experimental details </S>",

    "<S> , we retrieve the single photon from the bec . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we generate a second single - photon pulse in the cavity , thereby mapping the atomic spin state onto the photon polarization . the generation of the second photon can be performed before , during , or after retrieving the first photon from the bec . </S>",

    "<S> on one hand , increasing the atom - cavity coupling , e.g.  by reducing the cavity volume , would help to create single photons at the free - space resonance more efficiently . on the other hand , choosing a different alkali atom might result in a much lower scattering rate of eit control photons , thus allowing for the use of the @xmath19 line with larger matrix elements and for more shots per bec . </S>",
    "<S> long - term opportunities lie in quantum networks @xcite and in quantum logic gates based on magnon - magnon interaction in the bec @xcite . </S>",
