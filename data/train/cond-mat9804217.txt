    "block copolymers ( bcps ) , comprising chemically distinct polymers permanently linked together , are interesting because of the diverse array of ordered phases to which both polymer theory and experiment have been directed.@xcite the phase behavior of diblock copolymer melts is a competition between the entropic tendency to mix the two species into an isotropic melt , and an energetic penalty for having unlike species adjacent , which induces transitions into ordered phases of many symmetries , depending on the topology and composition of the polymers . near the order - disorder transition ( weak incompatibility ) entropy effects dominate , and the individual polymers retain ( within mean field ) their gaussian coil conformation through the transition,@xcite , while at much higher incompatibilities the chains are strongly stretched .",
    "it is this strongly stretched regime which we address here .",
    "leibler developed the first complete theory of ordered phases in bcp melts@xcite , and predicted the by - now classical phases of lamellar ( l ) , cylindrical ( c ) and spherical ( s ) symmetry using the random phase approximation to derive an effective landau free energy in terms of composition modulations in fourier space .",
    "the strong segregation regime was studied by helfand and co - workers @xcite and semenov @xcite , who predicted the same series of phases with increasing asymmetry , denoted by the fraction @xmath1 of polymer a in an @xmath2 diblock .",
    "( in this work we always use a to denote the minority block ) .",
    "this treatment balances the stretching energy of a polymer chain with the interfacial energy between a and b regions . by assuming an incompressible melt , minimization of the free energy gives a preferred domain size which scales as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the degree of polymerization .",
    "in the strong segregation limit the free energies of all microphases scale the same way with chain length and interfacial tension , so the phase boundaries become independent of the strength of the repulsion @xmath5 between a and b monomers and depend only on the composition @xmath6 .",
    "semenov s calculation in effect gave a lower bound to the free energy of the l , c , and s phases because the phases he constructed did not fill space , but were micelles of the corresponding topology @xcite .",
    "this approximation treats the @xmath2 interface and outer block surface as having the same circular or spherical shape , and is sufficient for understanding the qualitative aspects of the transitions between the phases .",
    "experiments followed the theories of leibler and semenov and quickly discovered a new phase,@xcite , originally thought to be ordered bicontinuous double diamond ( here denoted d ) , of @xmath7 symmetry , but recently shown to be of @xmath8 symmetry @xcite and related to the minimal surface known as the gyroid ( g).@xcite the g phase occurs for compositions between those of the l and c phases , can occur directly from the disordered phase upon increasing the incompatibility @xmath9 , and is found to be unstable to the l or c phases at high enough @xmath9.@xcite    although several groups attempted to describe this transition theoretically,@xcite using variations on leibler s theory , the first successful theory is due to matsen and schick @xcite , who developed a method for computing the free energy of any crystalline structure by expanding the partition function in the basis functions for the symmetry of the desired mesophase , rather than the fourier mode expansion of leibler .",
    "they found a stable gyroid phase for @xmath10 , where the upper limit was determined by extrapolation from the phase boundaries at lower @xmath9.@xcite this was followed by careful application of leibler s method,@xcite to include higher harmonics and calculate the stability of the g phase in weak segregation analytically .",
    "roughly concurrent to the calculations of matsen and schick , methods were developed to calculate the free energy of essentially arbitrary structures in the strong segregation regime ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "these methods use the results for polymer brushes,@xcite , supplemented by an ansatz about the geometry of the relevant phase and an assumption about the chain paths . olmsted and milner assumed straight paths through the @xmath2 interface and locally specified the volume fraction per molecule,@xcite , while likhtman and semenov relaxed the assumption of straight paths @xcite but enforced the constraint of constant @xmath1 per molecule only globally .",
    "the former approach corresponds to an upper bound on the free energy ( see below ) , while it is not clear that the likhtman - semenov calculations corresponds to any bound , or indeed to any systematic approximation , because the local constraint of constant composition is relaxed . by comparing upper bounds between bicontinuous , c , and",
    "l phases ( obtained for the cylindrical phase by assuming hexagonal symmetry and imposing straight paths ) , we showed that the bicontinuous phases are unstable , when comparing upper bounds , to the l and c phases .",
    "later , xi and milner extended this work to calculations with kinked polymer paths , and found an upper bound to the hexagonal phase which lies very close to the lower bound using round unit cells.@xcite    experiments have found an additional phase at @xmath5 values between the g and l phases @xcite , a hexagonally - perforated lamellae ( hpl ) phase , which consists of majority lamellae connected through a minority matrix by hexagonal arrays of tubes.@xcite the stacking has been suggested to be @xmath12 @xcite or @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "theoretical attempts to justify this phase have failed in both the strong segregation limit , where fredrickson chose a catenoid as a candidate base surface;@xcite and in the weak - segregation limit by self - consistent field calculations @xcite .",

    "we present the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite in more detail .",
    "we show that the g geometry is the most stable of the candidate bicontinuous phases , followed by the d and p geometries , and that the g phase can be stable for block - copolymers with sufficient conformational asymmetry .",

    "it is evident that there are shape factors @xmath37 which have lower free energy than the straight- and kinked - path hexagonal upper bounds ( figure [ fig : wedgeshape ] ) , so it is not unreasonable to hope that a judicious packing configuration can be a stable thermodynamic phase .",

    "consistent with experiments and self - consistent field theory , we do not find a stable g phase . at the lamellar  kinked - path - hexagons free energy crossing ( @xmath126 )",
    "the free energy of the @xmath121 phase is of order @xmath127 larger , while at the lamellar  straight - path - hexagons free energy crossing ( @xmath128 ) the free energy of the @xmath121 phase is only a few tenths of a percent ( @xmath129 ) greater .",
    "this , we have argued , may be the fairer comparison , since both calculations use straight paths .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know how to perform a kinked - paths estimate for the bicontinuous phases .",
    "note , however , that we do not expect to gain as much energy from a kinked - path calculation for the bicontinuous phases as for the cylindrical topologies .",
    "consider the hexagonal calculation .",
    "the boundaries of the wigner - seitz cell , and hence the @xmath2 dividing surface , have sharp corners into which the chains must stretch .",
    "presumably a large part of the gain in the kinked - path calculation comes from relieving the strain associated with this stretch , and relaxing the inner block to its preferred circular structure .",
    "bicontinuous phases , on the other hand , have smooth `` wigner - seitz boundaries '' ( _ i.e. _ the minimal surface ) , and expensive stretching occurs mainly at the junctions of the skeleton lattice .",
    "hence , the anomalous stretching that may be relieved by a kinked - path calculation occurs along points in the structure , rather than along lines .",
    "so we expect that our straight - path estimate is not likely to differ greatly from a kinked - path estimate , and that the free energy of the g phase remains well above that of the kinked - path hexagons .",
    "the stretching of the chains at the junctions presumably contributes to the relative stability of the @xmath130 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 structures , which have 6- , 4- , and 3-fold coordinated bond lattices .",
    "the more highly - coordinated lattices require more chain stretching to accommodate the space , which suggests that @xmath130 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 occur in increasing order of stability .",
    "this picture is corroborated by recent work of matsen and bates @xcite , who quantitatively examined the packing frustration in the g , d , and hpl phases .",
    "= 7.0truein    2 our results apply to the strong - segregation limit , which is attained in the limit of large @xmath5 .",
    "because the phase boundaries shift away from @xmath131 as @xmath5 increases from weak segregation @xcite , we expect our phase boundaries to be further from @xmath131 than experimental values , which is indeed the case .",
    "figure  [ fig : asym ] shows free energy crossings for various values of the conformational asymmetry parameter @xmath105 .",
    "relative to a conformationally symmetric melt , conformational asymmetry stabilizes phases with a stiff minority species and destabilizes phases with a stiff majority species , moving boundaries to larger @xmath132 for @xmath106 .",
    "recall that for @xmath133 the inner @xmath72-block is more flexible , while the @xmath73-block is stiffer and better able to stretch .",
    "we find that @xmath133 reduces the relative stability of the g phase , while the stability is enhanced for @xmath106 , and becomes stable for rather large asymmetries @xmath134 ( figure  [ fig : asymg ] ) .",
    "= 3.5truein    previous calculations of phase diagrams of conformationally - asymmetric diblocks have been done in the weak segregation regime,@xcite and , for the generic symmetric wedge as a model bicontinuous structure , in the strong segregation regime.@xcite matsen and bates @xcite found , as we do , that conformational asymmetry stabilizes the g phase with a stiff minority phase , widening the composition window and moving the lamellar - g and g - cylinder boundaries to higher stiff compositions ; and destabilizes the g phase with a stiff majority phase , both narrowing the composition window and shifting it to a higher stiff fraction .",
    "their calculations are limited to @xmath135 , and it is inconclusive whether the @xmath136 limit of this calculation yields a stable g phase .",
    "the same qualitative behavior was found for the generic symmetric wedge in the strong segregation regime.@xcite    table  [ table2 ] summarizes asymmetry parameters from recently collected data @xcite . while none of these diblocks have the large conformational asymmetry required to test our prediction of a stable phase in strong segregation , @xmath137 starblock copolymers have asymmetry factors larger , by a factor of @xmath138 , than those due to intrinsic chain stiffness effects alone .",
    "for example a @xmath139@xmath140 starpolymer has an asymmetry factor @xmath141 .",
    "we have attempted to calculate energies for the hpl @xcite phase , which is now accepted as a metastable phase @xcite .",
    "the minimal crystal phases d , p , and g have obvious candidate minimal surfaces to act as an intermaterial dividing surface towards which the majority - phase ends stretch ; and the minority - phase ends stretch towards the skeletal bond lattice . on the other hand",
    ", the majority - phase ends in the hpl phase stretch towards a combination of lines ( in the hexagonally - arranged perforating tubes ) and surfaces ( within the majority - phase layer ) .",
    "similarly , it is not obvious how to partition the minority - phase ends between lines and surfaces .",
    "the result is a non - analytic mapping which is difficult to minimize over .",
    "our attempts have thus far yielded quite high energies , of order that of the @xmath130 phase .",
    "we have outlined a general method for computing the free energy of block copolymer phases in the strong segregation regime .",
    "the procedure consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "choose a candidate geometry and an associated partitioning surface that divides space into disjoint interpenetrating regions ( the majority blocks from the two regions stretch towards this surface ) .",
    "2 .   divide the enclosed volume into infinitesimal wedges , defined by straight paths connecting the partitioning surface to a skeleton of bonds ( the minority blocks stretch towards this bond skeleton ) .",
    "the a - b interface in each wedge is located such that the fraction of wedge volume filled by a blocks is locally equal to @xmath1 . the interfacial contribution to the free energy",
    "is the area of the a - b interface times the a - b surface tension .",
    "4 .   compute the stretching free energy per chain for each wedge within the approximation of straight paths .",
    "calculations for straight paths involve slight adjustments to the wedges whose contributions vanish in the limit of small wedges .",
    "5 .   optimize the free energy per chain with respect to the overall scale of the mesophase ( _ e.g. _ , the dimension of the unit cell ) .",
    "optimize the mapping from the partitioning surface to the bond skeleton to minimize the overall free energy .",
    "in certain structures ( _ e.g. _ hpl ) the majority phase ends lie on both lines and surfaces , in which case the procedure above must be suitably generalized .",
    "we have also shown how to calculate the free energy for geometries where the shape of the @xmath2 interface is specified , for phases of cylindrical topology .",
    "this requires polymer chain paths which are kinked at the @xmath2 interface .",
    "the infinitesimal wedges are described by the relative area function @xmath142 ( eq  [ eq : area ] ) which is parametrized by a single scalar @xmath37 ( eq  [ eq : p ] and table  [ table1 ] ) that roughly gauges the local gaussian curvature of the partitioning surface . for the classical phases",
    "all wedges are identical , while bicontinuous phases have different distributions of shape factors @xmath37 . for symmetric stars",
    "we find a metastable bicontinuous ( gyroid , or g ) phase which is most stable near the lamellae - hexagonal cylinder transition . for sufficiently asymmetric copolymers ( @xmath134 )",
    "we predict a _ stable _ g phase .            in a weakly segregated mesophase ,",
