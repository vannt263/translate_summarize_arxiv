    "as one of fundamental theories for interactions in nature , the classical einstein theory of gravity , which plays an essential role in the standard model of modern cosmology ( @xmath6cdm ) , should be realized in the scaling - invariant domain of a fixed point of its quantum field theory , analogously to other renormalizable gauge field theories in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that the quantum field theory of gravity regularized at an ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff might have a non - trivial uv - stable fixed point and asymptotic safety , namely the renormalization group ( rg ) flows are attracted into the uv - stable fixed point with a finite number of physically renormalizable operators for the gravitational field .",
    "the evidence of such uv - stable fixed point has been found in the different short - distance regularization frameworks of dimensional continuation @xcite , the large @xmath12 ( the number of matter fields ) approximation @xcite , lattice methods @xcite , the truncated exact renormalization group @xcite , and perturbation theory @xcite , as well as our approach to the quantum gravity @xcite that will be discussed below .",
    "the regularized and quantized gravitational field theory , see for example the bare action @xmath13 of eq .",
    "( [ pact ] ) below , must be well - defined in a space - time and gauge independent regularization ( cutoff ) scheme for controlling quantum field fluctuating modes at short distances . in the scaling - invariant domain of the uv - stable fixed point ,",
    "the operators of @xmath13 obey rg - equations , the irrelevant operators are suppressed by the cutoff , whereas the relevant operators become renormalizable operators at long distances .",
    "it is expected that the classical einstein theory would be realized as an effective theory with two relevant and renormalizable operators @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the cosmological and gravitational constant , and `` @xmath16 '' stands for matter fields and possible high - dimensional operators ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is a nature and important issue to study the asymptotic safety of quantum gravitational field and their applications to the universe evolution .",
    "some attempts have been made @xcite .",
    "we present our preliminary study of this issue in this article .",
    "by the analogy of quantization of non - abelian gauge field theories , we adopted @xcite the diffeomorphism and local ( lorentz ) gauge - invariant regularization scheme , which is a background - independent simplicial complex with a unique space - time running cutoff @xmath17 , to regularize and quantize the einstein - cartan field theory for gravitational field , massless fermion and gauge fields .",

    "we have to confess that the result ( [ cmc ] ) bases on the dimensional analysis . the rigorous calculations by both analytical and numerical approaches are necessarily required to obtain the cosmological term ( [ vol ] ) .",
    "this is a difficult task of the theory .",
    "nevertheless we argue that because the fundamental operators in the theory @xmath13 of eq .",
    "( [ pact ] ) are the dimension-2 area operators , rather than dimension-4 density operators , the dependence of the cosmological constant on the correlation length has the form of eq .",

    "( [ pact ] ) and ( [ part ] ) .",
    "the regularized action ( [ pact ] ) at the space - time cutoff @xmath0 is actually the ratio of activation energy per the fundamental area operator @xmath63 and squared gravitational gauge coupling @xmath64 , the latter acts as if it is a `` temperature '' .    in the weak coupling limit @xmath65 ,",
    "all quantum fields of gravity and matter are asymptotically decoupled . moreover , quantum fields @xmath66 are frozen to the configurations of completely randomly fluctuating and uncorrelated fields at the cutoff scale @xmath0 and the fundamental operators @xmath63 have activation energies at the cutoff scale @xmath67 .",
    "this `` random '' configuration is a maximal - entropy configuration .",
    "it corresponds to the @xmath68 , where the expectational value @xmath69 is evaluated with respect to the partition function ( [ part ] ) .",
    "the reasons are that the partition function ( [ part ] ) , i.e. , the amplitude of configurations @xmath66 , is dominated by the `` random '' configuration @xmath68 , and other configurations with @xmath70 are exponentially suppressed by their weight @xmath71 for @xmath65 .",
    "this implies @xcite that ( i ) there is a disorder phase @xmath68 at @xmath65 , where the fundamental operators @xmath63 are suppressed by their activation energies @xmath72 , and ( ii ) the correlation between two fundamental operators @xmath63 is limited in their neighborhood and the correlation length @xmath73 .    as the coupling @xmath27 deviates from @xmath65 and increases for @xmath74 , the more and more fundamental area operators @xmath63 start to activate and correlate each other . as a result",
    "the long - ranged order @xmath51-configurations of @xmath75 are excited by the probability @xmath76 .",
    "this means that in a length scale larger than the cutoff @xmath0 , more and more degrees of freedom of quantum fields @xmath66 are correlated and the activation energy ( per @xmath63 ) decreases .",
    "this implies the occurrence of a phase transition at the critical coupling @xmath77 on the other hand , as the coupling @xmath27 increases and moves away from the critical coupling @xmath9 , the ratio ( @xmath78 ) of the correlation length @xmath44 and uv - cutoff @xmath0 increases , indicating that the critical coupling @xmath9 should be a uv - unstable fixed point .",
    "this feature can also be seen from the perturbation result @xcite of positive one - loop @xmath79-function @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a small dimensionless newton constant in the effective theory of gravitational field with the uv - cutoff",
    ".    however , we know neither the exact @xmath9-value ( @xmath82 ) , nor the measure and properties of the @xmath9-domain .",
    "instead of being a scaling - invariant domain , the part of @xmath9-domain is expected to be a crossover domain where the correlation length @xmath44 is not much larger than the uv - cutoff @xmath0 so that @xmath44 does not decouple from @xmath0 variation .",
    "therefore , in addition to operators in the effective einstein action ( [ ec0 ] ) , there are unsuppressed high - dimension operators of the regularized action ( [ pact ] ) following the rg flows in the crossover domain . in this article , we postulate that the measure ( @xmath27-range ) of the crossover in the @xmath9-domain is small , namely , the ratio @xmath78 rapidly increases for a small @xmath27-increase , corresponding to the positive @xmath79-function @xmath83 .",
    "this postulation implies that for some small @xmath27-values in the @xmath9-domain , we would be allowed to make some approximate calculations by an expansion in the powers of @xmath84 .",
    "we will come back to this point in the last section .",
    "moreover , at the critical coupling @xmath9 , the phase transition possibly occurs from the planck phase ( @xmath85 ) , where all fundamental interactions including gravity are unified , to the phase ( @xmath86 ) of grant unification theory of gauge interactions to matter - fields .",

    "the first , in a renormalizable field theory in the scaling - invariant domain of a non - trivial fixed point , the removal of the cutoff @xmath0 means that renormalized physical operators at the scale @xmath5 do not depend on quantum field fluctuations at the cutoff @xmath116 , the irrelevant operators are suppressed by the powers of @xmath110 .",
    "the second , the physical correlation length @xmath5 and coupling @xmath27 have to be determined by comparing final results with observations and experiments carried out at the known scales .    since fixed points and their scaling - invariant domains",
    "are universal , i.e. , independent of different regularization schemes at the uv - cutoff , we expect that the nontrivial uv - stable fixed point @xmath10 of gravitational gauge coupling should relate to the non - gaussian fixed point @xmath117 of @xmath118 for energy @xmath119 obtained in refs .",
