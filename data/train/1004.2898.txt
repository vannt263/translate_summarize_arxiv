    "the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) is the time required for an ensemble of identical systems starting from a given initial distribution of configurations to reach a fixed criterion . being able to obtain",
    "the mfpt is important in a wide array of physical applications .",
    "these include the mfpt when a star of a certain mass goes supernova , to neuron firing dynamics , spreading of diseases , chemical kinetics , folding processes of polymers , the death of living creatures , and the decay of metastable states via nucleation and growth processes @xcite .",
    "the projective dynamics ( pd ) method to calculate mfpt for systems with a discrete state space @xcite mapped the mfpt problem for metastable decay of magnetic states associated with ising - type ( discrete spin states ) models onto a nearest - neighbor coupled master equation .",
    "however , the pd method has not previously been shown to be valid for other dynamical systems , for example for systems with continuous state spaces @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the mfpt for systems with long time scales has previously required that the dynamic system satisfy certain conditions .",
    "for example , for the milestoning method @xcite to work the system must be close to equilibrium or have separation of time scales or committer surfaces .",
    "we prove in this letter that the pd method has no such constraints , and hence it is generally applicable to obtain the mfpt of _ any _ dynamical system .",
    "we prove that for any mfpt problem ( with a finite mfpt ) there exists a discrete master equation with nearest - neighbor coupling that has the same mfpt as the original system .",
    "this master equation has time - independent rates , even if the underlying system is non - markovian .",
    "every point in phase space in the original system must be mapped onto a state in the discrete master equation .",
    "we show that _ any _ mapping that leads to only nearest - neighbor coupling in the master equation preserves the mfpt provided the growing ( @xmath2 ) and shrinking ( @xmath3 ) rates between all master equation states @xmath4 are correct .",
    "therefore , whether the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are known theoretically or are measured , the correct mfpt is obtained . for metastable decay in the ferromagnetic @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 ising case such knowledge enabled calculations of mfpt of about @xmath8 monte carlo steps per spin @xcite .",
    "it is anticipated that the knowledge that the pd method gives the correct mfpt will enable long - time - scale simulations for other physical models .",
    "an example of where the pd method may be useful for long - time simulations is studies of the intercalation time of li ions in molecular dynamics studies modeling charging of batteries @xcite .",
    "consider any ensemble of systems evolving in phase space @xmath9 under some dynamic .",
    "they start with some given distribution , and we desire to calculate the mfpt until each system stops after it meets some fixed stopping criterion .",
    "the dynamics of the ensemble can be mapped onto a set of discrete non - overlapping states @xmath0 , with @xmath10@xmath11@xmath4@xmath11@xmath12 , which cover the entire domain .",
    "we impose the restriction that the states @xmath13 can make transitions only to the states @xmath1 .",
    "this condition can be met for many systems by adjusting the ` length ' @xmath14 of the states , so that no transitions within a single time step @xmath15 further than to the neighboring states exist .",
    "the states that form the stopping citerion will all be mapped to @xmath16 .",
    "the time - evolution of the system can be described by a master equation with nearest neighbor coupling , which describes the change of occupation @xmath17 of state @xmath4 by the probability flows between adjacent states .",
    "namely , @xmath18   p_k(t)+s_{k-1}p_{k-1}(t ) \\mbox { , } \\label{master1}\\ ] ] where the growing @xmath2 ( shrinking @xmath3 ) rates represent the directional rates at which the system transits from state @xmath4 to state @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the initial conditions @xmath21 are specified by the ensemble of initial conditions of the original system .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the number of times the system makes a transition from state @xmath4 to its neighboring states ( @xmath23 ) in the time interval @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 the number of times the system resides in state @xmath4 at time @xmath26 .",
    "then the growing rate for the time interval @xmath27 $ ] can be obtained by measuring the system at time intervals @xmath15 .",
    "explicitly @xmath28 a similar expression exists for the shrinking rate @xmath3 . assuming that the ensemble of systems has been fully absorbed at @xmath29 after starting at @xmath30",
    ", we write in shorthand the master equation @xmath31 where the elements of @xmath32 are the growing and shrinking rates , which have been measured from @xmath30 up to some point in time when all systems in the ensemble are fully absorbed . by using the fundamental relation @xcite @xmath33 the general expression for the mfpt @xmath34 for a system starting fully in state @xmath35",
    "can be obtained as @xmath36 \\label{001}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 denotes the starting state and @xmath12 the total number of states within the domain .",
    "we prove that eq .",
    "( [ 001 ] ) gives the same mfpt independent of the particular choice of the states .",
    "for this purpose , let @xmath37 be the joined interval of state @xmath4 and @xmath20 , then for a single time step it follows that the transitions from state @xmath38 to @xmath19 ( @xmath39 ) in the new system are equal to the transitions from state @xmath4 to @xmath19 ( @xmath20 to @xmath39 ) in the old system namely @xmath40 and @xmath41 , whereas the probability of occupation of state @xmath38 rescales as @xmath42/\\sum_k n_k(t)$ ] .",
    "thus the growing rate at time @xmath26 in the old and new system are related as @xmath43 and similarly for the new shrinking rate @xmath44 .    that this procedure leaves the mfpt unchanged",
    "can be understood by noting the effect of joining two states on the master equation .",
    "the joining of adjacent states corresponds to the addition of terms of the master equation of the same adjacent states , namely @xmath18   p_k(t)+s_{k-1}p_{k-1}(t ) \\mbox{. } \\label{master2}\\ ] ] and @xmath45   p_{k+1}(t)+s_{k}p_k(t ) \\mbox{. } \\label{master3}\\ ] ] it is easily seen that the cross terms vanish and we are left with an expression of the form @xmath46 using ( [ gres ] ) and similarly for @xmath44 in ( [ masterend ] ) for a single time step , leads to @xmath47   \\tilde{p}_{m}(t)+s_{k-1}p_{k-1}(t ) \\mbox{.}\\ ] ] hence the general form [ compare eq .",
    "( [ master1 ] ) and ( [ master2 ] ) ] is restored in the reduced system of equations . performing this joining repeatedly ,",
    "finally only one state is left .",

    "the structure of the individual chain is maintained by three interatomic potentials : a bond - stretching potential , a bond - angle bending potential , and a rejecting potential avoiding an overlap of @xmath85 or @xmath86 monomers .",
