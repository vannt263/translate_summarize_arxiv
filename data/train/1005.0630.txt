    "the mid - infrared ( @xmath11 ) sed is a complex interplay of broad emission features thought to arise from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules , silicate absorption features at 9.7 and 18  @xmath0 , and a mid - infrared continuum from very small grains @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared luminosities measured near @xmath38  @xmath0 have been found to correlate with the total infrared ( ir ; @xmath12 ) luminosities of galaxies in the local universe @xcite , which itself is a measure of a galaxy s sfr .",
    "while a correlation is found , there does exist a large amount of scatter @xcite and systematic departures for low metallicity systems @xcite .",
    "it is therefore uncertain if these empirical relations between mid - infrared and total ir luminosities ( @xmath13 ) for galaxies in the local universe are applicable for galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "recently , data from deep far - infrared surveys such as the far - infrared deep legacy survey ( fidel ; pi : m. dickinson ) are confirming the same redshift evolution of the sfr density seen in the mid - infrared and do not show any evolution in the sed of infrared luminous galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , @xcite have provided evidence that the high redshift lensed mid - infrared selected galaxies might show a factor of @xmath32 stronger rest - frame 8  @xmath0 emission compared to their total ir luminosities . using mid - infrared spectroscopy for 22 sources selected at 24  @xmath0 in the goods - n field ,",
    "along with existing 850  @xmath0 and additional 70  @xmath0 imagery obtained as part of fidel , we aim to improve our understanding of the star formation and agn activity within a diverse group of @xmath14 galaxies .",
    "this is done through a more proper estimate of ir luminosities and the ability to decompose these measurements into star - forming and agn components . for the full study",
    ", please see @xcite .",
    "by plotting the @xmath15 mid - infrared regions of the four different @xcite fits ( see caption ) for each galaxy in the left panel of figure [ fig-1 ] , one easily sees that by using 24  @xmath0 flux densities alone the equivalent widths of the aromatic features observed in the irs spectra are underestimated by the @xcite templates , resulting in highly discrepant estimates ( i.e. overestimates ) of ir luminosity . the range of ir luminosities derived by fitting the 24  @xmath0 photometry alone span a range between @xmath16 ( i.e. nearly two orders of magnitude ) with a median of @xmath17 .",
    "looking at the best - fit estimates for the ir luminosities among the entire sample , we find that they range between @xmath18 ( i.e. a factor of @xmath335 ) having a median of @xmath19 .",
    "the 24  @xmath0-derived ir luminosity is a factor of @xmath34 larger than that for the best - fit estimates , on average .    using our best - fit ir luminosites",
    ", we also note that 16 out of the 22 sample galaxies are classified as ulirgs while the remaining 6 are lirgs .",
    "looking at the differences between the 24  @xmath0 to our best - fit ir luminosities , the discrepancy is found to be much larger among the ulirgs than for the lirgs . the 24  @xmath0-derived ir luminosities are larger than the best - fit ir luminosities by a factor of @xmath35 , on average , for the ulirgs while being only @xmath31.2 times larger , on average , for the lirgs .",
    "in the right panel of figure [ fig-1 ] we plot agn luminosity versus the difference between the 24  @xmath0 and best - fit estimate ir luminosities . a clear trend of increasing agn luminosity with increasing overestimation of the ir luminosity using 24  @xmath0 photometry alone is observed ; or , in other words , agn luminosity appears to scale with increasing mid - infrared luminosity . performing an ordinary least squares fit to the data , we find that @xmath20 while the differences between the 24  @xmath0 and best - fit ir luminosities are large for galaxies having large ( i.e. @xmath2160% ) mid - infrared agn fractions , we find these quantities to be unrelated for galaxies having smaller mid - infrared agn fractions .",
    "we also find that the agn luminosity accounts for only 16% of the difference between the 24  @xmath0 derived and best - fit ir luminosities , on average .",
    "this indicates that the agn contribution to the mid - infrared excesses , which would result in overestimates of ir - based sfrs , is close to negligible when compared to the improper bolometric correction applied when estimating total ir luminosities by fitting local sed templates with 24  @xmath0 data alone .",
    "sfrs derived by subtracting the agn fraction from the 24  @xmath0 photometry are larger than the agn corrected best - fit ir sfrs by a factor of @xmath31 to @xmath33.3 , on average for redshifts below and above @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the agn - corrected 24  @xmath0 sfrs are factors of @xmath31 to @xmath368 times larger than the corresponding uv - corrected sfrs for sample galaxies at redshifts above @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the agn is not the dominant source of the inferred  mid - infrared excesses \" ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) among these systems .",
    "in the present study we have used observations from the mid - infrared to the submillimeter to properly characterize the ir luminosities for a diverse sample of 22 galaxies spanning a redshift range of @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , we have used the mid - infrared spectra of these sources to estimate the fractions of their ir luminosities which arise from an agn .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "ir ( @xmath6 ) luminosities derived by sed fitting observed 24  @xmath0 flux densities alone are well matched to those when additional mid - infrared spectroscopy and 16 , 70 , and 850  @xmath0 photometry are included in the fits for galaxies having @xmath24 and @xmath25 values typically @xmath26@xmath27 . in contrast , for galaxies lying in a redshift range between 1.4 and 2.6 with @xmath25 values typically @xmath21@xmath27 , ir luminosities derived by sed template fitting using observed 24  @xmath0 flux densities alone overestimate the true ir luminosity by a factor of @xmath35 , on average , compared to fitting all available data .",
    "a comparison between the observed mid - infrared spectra with that of the seds chosen from fitting 24  @xmath0 photometry alone and from fitting all available photometric data demonstrates that local high luminosity sed templates show weaker pah emission by an average factor of @xmath35 in this redshift range and do not properly characterize the contribution from pah emission .",
    "2 .   after decomposing the ir luminosity into star forming and agn components",
    ", we find the agn luminosity to be increasing with increasing difference between the 24  @xmath0-derived and our best - fit ir luminosities .",
    "such a trend suggests that the agn power increases with mid - infrared luminosity .",
    "however , we also find that the median fraction of the agn to the difference between the 24  @xmath0-derived and best - fit ir luminosities is only 16% suggesting the agn power is almost negligible compared to the bolometric correction necessary to properly calibrate the 24  @xmath0-derived ir luminosities .",
