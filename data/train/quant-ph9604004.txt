    "therefore its arbitrary subseries , including @xmath197 , converge at @xmath193 , which is a contradiction .",
    "now we prove that the operator @xmath13 ( see ( [ dadef ] ) ) is ill - defined for @xmath200 for the discrete representation ( [ reps ] ) .",
    "to do this we first consider the operator @xmath201 and take the expectation value @xmath202 since only the even power terms are non - vanishing we get @xmath203 among the @xmath204 terms in the expansion of @xmath205 we take the middle term @xmath206 only and consider the following subseries of ( [ quadev ] ) @xmath207 which can be easily evaluated : @xmath208 from this we can easily find that its radius of convergence @xmath209 is given by @xmath210 thus we find from corollary 2 that the operator @xmath201 diverges for @xmath211 .    secondly , taking into account of the algebraic isomorphism of su(1,1 ) @xmath212 and replacing @xmath213 , with real @xmath52 , we find that the operator @xmath13 is ill - defined for @xmath16 , @xmath28 .",
    "it is interesting that each exponential operator in the right side of the identity @xmath214 is well - defined for all real values of @xmath52 because @xmath215 is always true .",
    "one might be tempted to use the above identity to define the left side @xmath216 for all real value of @xmath52 . however , in the proof of this identity , differentiation on the left - side is used @xcite .",
    "that means the proof is valid only in the parameter range in which @xmath13 converges absolutely . outside of this region",
    "the operator itself is ill - defined and the termwise differentiation is not allowed .",
    "a similar remark applies to the squeeze operator @xmath217 of the simple - mode electromagnetic field @xcite @xmath218 we believe the above formula is ill - defined for @xmath211 .    by using the same argument",
    "we can show that the `` unitary '' operators @xmath219 , @xmath220 , have zero radii of convergence .",
    "this fact has already been noted in paper @xcite .",
    "the proof can be generalized further to any `` unitary '' operator @xmath221 , in which @xmath222 is a hermitian operator consisting of a polynomial in @xmath223  and @xmath224 .",
    "if @xmath222 contains a term @xmath225 , @xmath220 , where @xmath226 is an arbitrary function of the number operator @xmath227 , then the `` unitary '' operator @xmath221 has a zero radius of convergence .",
    "these hermitian operators form an infinite dimensional lie algebra , @xmath17 algebra , which is a symmetry algebra of the electron states of the lowest landau level in a very strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the above remark also implies that the @xmath17-group , to be obtained by the exponentiation of these @xmath17 generators , is simply _ ill - defined_.",
    "let us differentiate @xmath77 @xmath228 as before ) with respect to @xmath52 @xmath229 on the other hand , @xmath77 can be also expressed by using ( [ bchform ] ) @xmath230 from this we get @xmath231 by equating ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b4 ] ) we get @xmath232 multiplying ( [ b5 ] ) by @xmath233 and moving the second term on the right side to the left , we immediately obtain the equation ( [ 228 ] ) .",
