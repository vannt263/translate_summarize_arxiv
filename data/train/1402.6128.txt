    "when dealing with heavy - tailed insurance claims , it is a classical problem to consider and quantify the influence of the largest among the claims on their total sum , see e.g. ammeter ( 1964 ) for an early reference in actuarial literature .",
    "this topic is particularly relevant in non - proportional reinsurance applications when a significant proportion of the sum of claims is consumed by a small number of claims .",
    "the influence of the maximum of a sample on the sum has in particular attracted considerable attention over the last fifty years ( see ladoucette and teugels @xcite for a recent overview of existing literature on the subject ) .",
    "different modes of convergence of the ratios sum over maximum or maximum over sum have been linked with conditions on additive domain of attractions of a stable law ( see e.g. darling @xcite , bobrov @xcite , chow and teugels ct79 and bingham and teugels @xcite ) .    it is also of interest to study the joint distribution of normalized smallest and largest claims when the number of claims over time are described by a general counting process .",
    "this has an impact on the design of possible reinsurance strategies and risk management in general . in this paper",
    "we consider a homogeneous insurance portfolio , where the distribution of the individual claims has a regularly varying tail .",
    "the number of claims is generated by a near mixed poisson process .",
    "for this rather general situation we derive a number of limiting results for the joint laplace transforms of the smallest and largest claims , as the time @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "these turn out to be quite explicit and crucially depend on the rule of what is considered to be a large claim as well as on the value of the tail index .",
    "let @xmath1 be a sequence of independent positive random variables ( representing claims ) with common distribution function @xmath2 . for @xmath3 , denote by @xmath4 the corresponding order statistics .",
    "we assume that the claim size distribution satisfies the condition @xmath5where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a slowly varying function at infinity .",
    "the tail index is defined as @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the tail quantile function of @xmath2 . under , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is again a slowly varying function . for textbook treatments of regularly varying distributions and/or their applications in insurance modelling ,",

    "one particular example of a renewal process is the homogeneous poisson process , which is very popular in claims modelling and plays a crucial role in both actuarial literature and practice .",
