    "an s-(or z- ) shaped morphological symmetry has been observed for many extragalactic radio sources , for example , for 39 of 365 extended radio sources collected by florido , battaner , & sanchez - saavedra ( 1990 ) , for more than 30% of quasars with redshifts less than 1 and with a two - sided radio structure ( hutchings , price , & gower 1988 ) .",
    "this phenomenon has generally been attributed to precession in the orientation of the radio jet . with precessing jet models",
    ", it is indeed possible to fit apparently more complex image maps of many extended radio sources ( e.g. gower et al .",
    "jet precession was also invoked to account for other phenomena , such as the bending and misalignment of parsec scale jets in compact radio sources ( e.g. linfield 1981 ; appl , sol , & vicente 1996 ) , and the variability of either continuum or line emissions observed in active galactic nuclei ( e.g. rieger 2004 ; caproni , mosquera cuesta , & abraham 2004 ; but see  4 ) .    presumably , the jet material is ejected along the axis of a spinning black hole at the center of a galactic nucleus",
    ". there have been basically two models on what causes the central black hole to precess .",
    "begelman , blandford , & rees ( 1980 ) first proposed that the precession of the black hole could be due to the existence of another hole in the same nucleus .",
    "later , lu ( 1990 ) suggested that a surrounding , titled accretion disk could also do the job , on the basis of the model of sarazin , begelman , & hatchett ( 1980 ) for the galactic object ss433 .",
    "both the models predicted that there should be a tendency for the brighter sources to present the shorter precession periods , but the predicted precession period  luminosity relations in the two models were quantitatively different ( roos 1988 ; lu 1990 ) . while the idea of binary black holes is indeed interesting and",
    "has been applied in recent years to a number of extragalactic sources with precessing jets ( e.g. lobanov & roland 2005 and references therein ) , the scenario of a single black hole with an accretion disk surrounded seems to be simpler and more commonly applicable to active nuclei .",
    "in fact , the disk - caused jet precession model has received meaningful observational supports since it arose .",
    "for instance , veilleux , tully , & bland - hawthorn ( 1993 ) reported their detailed observational results of the seyfert galaxy ngc 3516 , and this source follows the theoretical precession period  luminosity relation of lu ( 1990 ) ; peck & taylor ( 2001 ) revealed that the compact source 1946 + 708 has radio jets with a tilted , circumnuclear disk , and stated that such an observed morphology is consistent with the scenario of lu ( 1990 ) .",
    "most previous studies of jet precession in galactic nuclei were for individual sources .",
    "in this letter we try to do the job in a more general sense .",
    "we first describe the model of jet precession caused by an accretion disk , which is an improvement of that proposed by lu ( 1990 ) ; and then collect all extragalactic sources to date with needed observational data available to test our model .",
    "a spinning ( kerr ) black hole has angular momentum @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the black hole mass , and @xmath2 is the dimensionless specific angular momentum , @xmath3 . consider an accretion disk surrounding the hole .",
    "the disk is tilted in the sense that its rotation axis is misaligned with that of the hole . a ring with width @xmath4 in the disk",
    "has angular momentum @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the surface density of the disk , and @xmath7 is the rotational velocity of the disk material , so the angular momentum per logarithmic interval of radius is @xmath8",
    ". there exists a critical radius @xmath9 in the disk defined by @xmath10 . due to the lense - thirring effect",
    ", disk material interior to @xmath9 will be aligned with the equatorial plane of the black hole , while the outer portion of the disk ( @xmath11 ) with sufficiently large angular momentum will maintain its orientation , and will cause the central hole along with the inner disk to precess ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ) .",
    "some material of the inner disk is assumed to be ejected out along the hole s spin axis , forming a precessing jet .",
    "the precession rate of the central black hole and the inner disk is equal to @xmath12 ( sarazin et al .",
    "1980 ) . since only regions @xmath11 in the disk contribute to this precession and @xmath13 decreases as @xmath14 increases ,",
    "the fastest precession rate @xmath15 is produced by the ring at @xmath16 with @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 . introducing the mass accretion rate @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the radial inflow velocity of the disk material , @xmath15 can be expressed as    @xmath21    the best known model of accretion disks is that of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , in which @xmath7 is keplerian , @xmath22 , and for the outer region of the disk + @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the critical accretion rate corresponding to the eddington luminosity , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the gravitational radius , and @xmath30 ( kato , fukue , & mineshige 1998 , p. 88 ) . substituting the expressions of @xmath7 and @xmath20 into equation ( 1 ) , the precession period @xmath31 can be calculated numerically ,    @xmath32    the mass accretion rate @xmath33 is related to the luminosity of the source @xmath34 as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the efficiency of energy conversion .",
    "note that here @xmath34 should be the optical luminosity of the galactic nucleus , rather than the radio luminosity of the jet , because the jet material is likely to derive its energy from the spinning black hole or from the disk via electro - magnetic processes , the jet luminosity does not reflect directly the accretion rate . by using the definition @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the absolute magnitude of the nucleus in the @xmath39 band , and @xmath40 is @xmath41 of the sun , a relationship between @xmath42 and @xmath38",
    "is obtained finally ,    @xmath43    this equation improves significantly equation ( 5 ) of lu ( 1990 ) , which is @xmath44 , as not only the slope @xmath45 has been recalculated to be @xmath46 , but also the previously unclear constant in the formula has been explicitly expressed .    the critical radius @xmath9 in the disk can be calculated as    @xmath47    which is about several thousand times of the black hole s gravitational radius @xmath48 . a similar result for @xmath9 has been obtained in the model for accretion disks in active galactic nuclei given by collin - souffrin & dumont ( 1990 ) .",
    "the theoretical @xmath49 relationship of equation ( 3 ) is practically testable , as @xmath42 and @xmath38 are observational quantities , and the ranges of values of the four parameters are all known , namely @xmath50 , @xmath3 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . as mentioned in  1 , many extragalactic radio sources show phenomena which are suggestive of jet precession .",
    "unfortunately , for most of those sources no precession periods have been measured , the number of sources with both the jet precession period and the nucleus magnitude data available is still rather small .",
    "we collect from the literature 41 such sources to our knowledge , and list them in table 1 .",
    "the following comments are in order . concerning the precession period , it is usually too long to be observed directly .",
    "the best way known to evaluate this period for a source is by fitting its ( s - shaped or apparently more complex ) radio map with a precessing jet model , like what was done by gower et al .",
    "this is indeed the case for most sources listed in table 1 .",
    "not surprisingly , the precession period obtained this way is by no means definite and accurate , it should be regarded as estimation of the order of magnitude only .",
    "for a few cases ( 3c 196 , 3c 305 , m 84 , and oj 287 ) the method of map fitting could not be ( or has not yet been ) used , the precession period was estimated by some other arguments . as to the sources optical absolute magnitudes",
    ", they are in general quite inaccurate and inhomogeneous in the literature . for most of our collected sources we have made use of the leda database and the simbad database , where the @xmath41 values can either be found directly or be calculated from given visual magnitudes @xmath53 and redshifts @xmath54 .",
    "we have made corrections so that all magnitudes in table 1 are in the @xmath39 band , and with @xmath55 .",
    "with all these uncertainties in mind , it seems that the data in table 1 tend to support an inverse correlation between the jet precession period and the optical luminosity of the galactic nucleus as equation ( 3 ) predicted , i.e. the brighter the nucleus is , the faster the jet precesses , as shown more clearly in figure 1 . for a quantitative comparison ,",
    "we draw in the figure the theoretical @xmath56 correlation of equation ( 3 ) by three straight lines .",
    "the middle solid line corresponds to the most typical values of the four constant parameters , i.e. @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "this line fits the observational data quite well .",
    "the upper and the lower dashed lines are also for @xmath61 , but for larger values @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ; and smaller values @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that all the 41 sources are located within the region bounded by these two reasonable limit lines . thus at this point the observational data are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction of the model .",
    "_ precession cone opening angle . _",
    "another physical component of the jet precession model is the half - opening angle @xmath67 of the precession cone along which the black hole s spin axis rotates . unlike the precession period @xmath42 ,",
    "@xmath67 has not been calculated and predicted theoretically in our model , nor in the binary black hole model .",
    "the only system in which @xmath67 is known ( @xmath68 ) by observations is the galactic object ss433 . for extragalactic sources ,",
    "the only way known to evaluate @xmath67 is by fitting a precessing jet model to the observed morphology and kinematics of the jet . in this",
    "fitting , @xmath67 is deduced as a free parameter along with others such as the precession period , viewing angle , and speed of the jet ( e.g. the early work gower et al .",
    "1982 that ignored the physical cause of jet precession , and the most recent one lobanov & roland 2005 that adopted the binary black hole model ) .",
    "table 1 lists values of @xmath67 available in the literature , all obtained this way . for the inner disk with angular momentum",
    "much smaller than that of the black hole , one can expect that the hole s spin axis almost coincides with the total angular momentum vector along which both the hole and the disk precess , i.e. the hole s precession cone opening angle is very small ( or the hole even does not precess at all ) .",
    "but for the case we consider here , the outer disk has angular momentum comparable to or larger than that of the hole , and gas accretion is likely to occur at random angles , thus initially the two angular momentum vectors can make any angle , i.e. @xmath67 can be of any value . in a very recent paper , king et al .",
    "( 2005 ; most clearly figure 1 there ) showed that , whatever the initial angle between the two angular momentum vectors ( the hole s and the disk s ) is , the hole suffers a torque which always acts to align the hole s spin with the total angular momentum , i.e. @xmath67 is always made to decrease with time .",
    "it is seen from table 1 that the values of @xmath67 are indeed random , and 20 of the total 33 values there are relatively small ( 1@xmath69  16@xmath69 ) .",
    "a small @xmath67 could be a feature of the initial configuration of a source , or it could be a result of evolution from a larger initial @xmath67 due to the alignment torque .",
    "some insight about @xmath67 may be gained from the study of a test particle orbiting a black hole .",
    "the off - equatorial plane motion of a test particle is characterized by the carter constant @xmath70 .",
    "to very high accuracy , @xmath70 can be treated as the square of the particle s specific ( per unit mass ) angular momentum projected into the equatorial plane ( perpendicular to the hole s spin ) .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath71 of the particle s circular orbit is defined as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the particle s specific angular momentum parallel to the hole s spin ( hughes & blandford 2003 ) . for large @xmath14",
    ", hughes ( 2001 ) gave a formula ( in @xmath74 units ) : @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "it is seen that depending on the values of two constants @xmath73 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 can be of any value ( note that @xmath71 corresponds to @xmath76 in our model since we consider a ring with angular momentum @xmath77 equal to that of the hole @xmath78 ) , and that whatever the value of @xmath71 is , the particle s whole specific angular momentum @xmath79 approaches the keplerian value @xmath80 as @xmath14 increases .",
    "_ short term precession ? _ as seen from equation ( 2 ) , the jet precession period is generally very long in our disk - caused precession model .",
    "appl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have also shown that the typical precession period of a supermassive black hole caused by a tilted massive torus is of the order of @xmath81 years .",
    "therefore we include in table 1 only those sources with precession periods ranging from @xmath82 to @xmath83 years .",
    "we notice that for a number of extragalactic sources the periodicity of about 10 years in the light curves has been observed , and this phenomenon has also been attributed by some authors to precession of jets and/or accretion disks ( e.g. caproni et al .",
    "2004 ) . in our opinion , such a short periodicity is most likely not related to the precession .",
    "it is due to either flaring activity in the disk , or geometry and non - linear motion of the jet .",
    "at least in some cases , setting such a short precession period has led to unrealistic results in the model fitting .",
    "for example , caproni & abraham ( 2004 ) assumed the period of 10.1 years observed in the @xmath39-band light curve of 3c 345 to be the jet precession period , and claimed that 3c 345 has two black holes with masses of @xmath84 and an orbital separation @xmath85 cm .",
    "such a separation is smaller than @xmath86 , then there would be no room for a stable accretion disk to exist at all !",
    "this is of course not to argue against the binary black hole model itself . also applying the binary black hole model to 3c 345 ,",
    "lobanov & roland ( 2005 ) obtained a precession period of 2570 years , black hole masses of @xmath87 , and an orbital separation @xmath88 in their model fitting , and these parameters seem to be more reasonable .",
    "similar problems may exist for objects 3c 120 , 3c 273 , and oj 287 , for which precession with periods @xmath89 10 years was also assumed ( see table 1 of caproni et al .",
    "2004 ) , while more plausible precession periods have been deduced by other authors ( table 1 here ) .",
    "_ summary_. the observational evidence is likely to be in favor of the disk - caused jet precession model according to the data in table 1 , at least at a statistical level , but it is still far from reaching a definite conclusion in the following senses . first , except that it does not require binary supermassive black holes to present in a large number of active nuclei , our model does not offer an explanation of the observational data which is conceptually different from that offered by the binary black hole model . some sources , namely 1928 + 738 , oj 287 , mrk 501 , pks 0420 - 014 , and 3c 345 , though being included in table 1 to support our model , were studied by corresponding authors in the framework of binary black hole model .",
    "second , that the black hole s precession cone angle can be of any value should be regarded as a hypothesis . in particular , it is not clear whether this angle as large as several tens degrees is physically possible . further investigations addressing this specific question on a fundamental basis are required .",
    "third , reasons for a large scale misalignment between the accretion disk and the black hole are also unclear .",
    "the misalignment may be created through gas accretion which is driven for example by minor mergers of galaxies with satellite galaxies and is likely to occur at random angles , then it is still a problem whether and how this misalignment can be preserved over timescales long enough to be reconciled with the extent of kpc - scale jets showing clear signs of precession .",
