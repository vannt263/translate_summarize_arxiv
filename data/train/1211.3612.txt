    "in 1905 , in the most meaningful article entitled _  on the electrodynamics of moving bodies \" _ , einstein solved the old incompatibility between classical mechanics and maxwell theory , leading to a reformulation of our conception of space and time . in order to do that",
    ", he tried to preserve the symmetries of maxwell equations by postulating the speed of light ( @xmath0 ) as invariant under any change of reference frame . at the end of his life , he continued searching in vain for the beauty of new symmetries in order to unify gravitation with electromagnetism , from where there would emerge a more fundamental explanation for the quantum phenomena by means of a theory of quantum gravity .    still inspired by the seductive search for new fundamental symmetries in nature@xcite , the present article attempts to implement a uniform background field into the flat space - time .",
    "such a background field connected to a uniform vacuum energy density represents a preferred reference frame , which leads us to postulate a universal and invariant minimum limit of speed for particles with very large wavelengths ( very low energies ) .",
    "the idea that some symmetries of a fundamental theory of quantum gravity may have non trivial consequences for cosmology and particle physics at very low energies is interesting and indeed quite reasonable .",
    "so it seems that the idea of a universal minimum speed as one of the first attempts of lorentz symmetry violation could have the origin from a fundamental theory of quantum gravity at very low energies ( very large wavelengths ) .    besides quantum gravity for the planck minimum length @xmath1 ( very high energies )",
    ", the new symmetry idea of a minimum speed @xmath2 could appear due to the indispensable presence of gravity at quantum level for particles with very large wavelengths ( very low energies ) .",
    "so we expect that such a universal minimum speed @xmath2 also depends on fundamental constants as for instance @xmath3 ( gravitation ) and @xmath4 ( quantum mechanics)@xcite . in this sense , there could be a relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 since @xmath5 .",
    "the origin of @xmath2 and a possible connection between @xmath2 and @xmath1 shall be deeply investigated in a further work@xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of the lowest non - null limit of speed for low energies ( @xmath6 ) in the space - time results in the following physical reasoning :    - in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the plane wave wave - function ( @xmath7 ) which represents a free particle is an idealisation that is impossible to conceive under physical reality . in the event of such an idealized plane wave , it would be possible to find with certainty the reference frame that cancels its momentum ( @xmath8 ) , so that the uncertainty on its position would be @xmath9 .",
    "however , the presence of an unattainable minimum limit of speed emerges in order to prevent the ideal case of a plane wave wave - function ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) .",
    "this means that there is no perfect inertial motion ( @xmath12 ) such as a plane wave , except the privileged reference frame of a universal background field connected to an unattainable minimum limit of speed @xmath2 , where @xmath13 would vanish .",
    "however , since such a minimum speed @xmath2 ( universal background frame ) is unattainable for the particles with low energies ( large length scales ) , their momentum can actually never vanish when one tries to be closer to such a preferred frame ( @xmath2 ) . on the other hand , according to special relativity ( sr ) , the momentum can not be infinite since the maximum speed @xmath0 is also unattainable for a massive particle , except the photon ( @xmath14 ) as it is a massless particle .",
    "this reasoning allows us to think that the photon ( @xmath14 ) as well as the massive particles ( @xmath15 ) are in equal - footing in the sense that it is not possible to find a reference frame at rest ( @xmath16 ) for any speed transformation in a space - time with both maximum and minimum speed limits .",
    "therefore , such a deformed special relativity was termed as symmetrical special relativity ( ssr)@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of particles in the presence of a universal background reference frame connected to @xmath2 is within a context of the ideas of sciama@xcite , schrdinger@xcite and mach@xcite , where there should be an  absolute \" inertial reference frame in relation to which we have the inertia of all moving bodies .",
    "however , we must emphasize that the concept used here is not classical as machian ideas , since the lowest ( unattainable ) limit of speed @xmath2 plays the role of a privileged ( inertial ) reference frame of a universal background field instead of the  inertial \" frame of fixed stars .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the idea of universal background field was sought in vain by einstein@xcite , motivated firstly by lorentz@xcite .",
    "it was einstein who coined the term _ ultra - referential _ as the fundamental aspect of reality to represent a universal background field@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "based on such a concept , let us call _ ultra - referential _ @xmath17 to be the universal background field of a fundamental inertial reference frame connected to @xmath2 ( see reference@xcite ) .    the present theory ( ssr )",
    "is a kind of deformed special relativity ( dsr ) with two invariant scales , namely the speed of light @xmath0 and a minimum speed @xmath2 .",
    "dsr was first proposed by camelia@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it contains two invariant scales : speed of light @xmath0 and a minimum length scale ( planck length @xmath1 of quantum gravity ) .",
    "an alternate approach to dsr theory , inspired by that of camelia , was proposed later by smolin and magueijo@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "another extension of special relativity ( sr ) is known as triply special relativity , which is characterized by three invariant scales , namely the speed of light @xmath0 , a mass @xmath18 and a length @xmath19@xcite .",
    "still another generalization of sr is the quantizing of speeds@xcite , where barrett - crane spin foam model for quantum gravity with positive cosmological constant was considered , encouraging the authors to look for a discrete spectrum of velocities and the physical implications of this effect , namely an effective deformed poincar symmetry .    in a more recent paper@xcite",
    ", it was shown that the existence of a minimum ( non - zero ) speed @xmath2 connected to a background field with minimum energy leads to a tiny positive cosmological constant , being in agreement with observations ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in fact , such an original physical result@xcite also encourage us to search for a deformed poincar symmetry with the presence of an invariant minimum speed @xmath2 .",
    "the classical notion we have about the inertial ( galilean ) reference frames , where the system at rest exists , is eliminated in ssr where @xmath21 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "however , if we consider classical systems composed of macroscopic bodies , the minimum speed v is neglected ( @xmath22 ) and so we can reach a vanishing velocity ( @xmath23 ) , i.e. , in the classical approximation ( @xmath24 ) , the ultra - referential @xmath17 is eliminated and simply replaced by the galilean reference frame s connected to a system at rest .    symmetrical special relativity ( ssr ) should contain three postulates , namely :    \\1 ) the constancy of the speed of light @xmath0 .",
    "\\2 ) the non - equivalence ( asymmetry ) of the reference frames , i.e. , we can not exchange the speed @xmath25 ( of @xmath26 ) for @xmath27 ( of @xmath17 ) by the inverse transformations , since we can not find the rest for @xmath28 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "such an asymmetry was explored by means of speed transformations of ssr in a previous paper@xcite .",
    "\\3 ) the covariance of the ultra - referential @xmath17 ( background frame ) connected to an unattainable minimum limit of speed @xmath2 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "let us assume the reference frame @xmath28 with a speed @xmath25 in relation to the ultra - referential @xmath17 according to fig",
    ". 1 .     moves with a velocity @xmath25 with respect to the background field of the covariant ultra - referential @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath24 , @xmath17 is eliminated and thus the galilean frame @xmath30 takes place , recovering lorentz transformations . ]    hence , to simplify , consider the motion at only one spatial dimension , namely @xmath29 space - time with background field @xmath17 .",
    "so we write the following transformations :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , being @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 for @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38    being @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a vector given in the direction of @xmath44 . in fig.1 ,",
    "we consider , for instance , the motion to right in the direction of @xmath44 ( @xmath29 space ) . the @xmath45 case will be explored in the next subsection .    at first sight",
    ", @xmath46 can be negative , however as it will be shown in section 4 , the limit @xmath2 forms an inferior energy barrier according to a new dynamical viewpoint of ssr , and so @xmath46 must be positive in physical reality .",
    "we have @xmath47 to be justified later . if @xmath48 ( @xmath49 or @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 would be imaginary , that is to say it is a non - physical factor .",
    "so we must have @xmath52 to be justified in section 4 .",
    "if we make @xmath24 ( @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) , we recover lorentz transformations , where the ultra - referential @xmath17 is eliminated and simply replaced by the galilean frame @xmath30 at rest for the classical observer .    in order to get the transformations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above ,",
    "let us consider the following more general transformations : @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are factors ( functions ) to be determined .",
    "we hope all these factors depend on @xmath60 , such that , for @xmath53 ( @xmath61 ) , we recover lorentz transformations as a particular case ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) . by using those transformations to perform",
    "@xmath65 $ ] , we find the identity : @xmath66= \\theta^2\\gamma^2[c^2t^2 - 2\\epsilon_1vtx+2\\epsilon_2vtx-\\epsilon_1 ^ 2v^2t^2+\\frac{\\epsilon_2 ^ 2v^2x^2}{c^2}-x^2]$ ] . since the metric tensor is diagonal , the crossed terms must vanish and so we assure that @xmath67 . due to this fact , the crossed terms ( @xmath68 ) are cancelled between themselves and finally we obtain @xmath65=   \\theta^2\\gamma^2(1-\\frac{\\epsilon^2 v^2}{c^2})[c^2t^2-x^2]$ ] . for @xmath53 ( @xmath69 and @xmath62 ) , we reinstate @xmath65=[c^2t^2-x^2]$ ] of sr .",
    "now we write the following transformations : @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where we assume @xmath72 and @xmath73 , so that @xmath74 for @xmath24 , which implies @xmath69 .",
    "so from such transformations we extract : @xmath75 and @xmath76 , from where we obtain @xmath77 . as @xmath78 is a dimensionless factor",
    ", we immediately conclude that @xmath79 and @xmath80 , so that we find @xmath81 . on the other hand",
    ", we can determine @xmath57 as follows : @xmath57 is a function of @xmath60 ( @xmath82 ) , such that @xmath62 for @xmath83 , which also leads to @xmath69 in order to recover lorentz transformations .",
    "so , as @xmath78 depends on @xmath60 , we conclude that @xmath57 can also be expressed in terms of @xmath78 , namely @xmath84 $ ] , where @xmath85 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath86=[f(\\alpha)(1-\\alpha)]^k$ ] , where the exponent @xmath87 .",
    "such a positive value must be justified later within a dynamical context ( section 4 ) .",
    "the function @xmath88 and @xmath18 will be estimated by satisfying the following conditions :    \\i ) as @xmath62 for @xmath83 ( @xmath22 ) , this implies @xmath89 .",
    "\\ii ) the function @xmath90^k}{(1-\\beta^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}=\\frac{[f(\\alpha)(1-\\alpha)]^k } { [ ( 1+\\beta)(1-\\beta)]^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$ ] should have a symmetrical behavior , that is to say it approaches to zero when closer to @xmath2 ( @xmath37 ) , and in the same way to the infinite when closer to @xmath0 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "in other words , this means that the numerator of the function @xmath92 , which depends on @xmath60 should have the same shape of its denominator , which depends on @xmath93 . due to such conditions",
    ", we naturally conclude that @xmath94 and @xmath95 , so that @xmath96^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{[(1+\\beta)(1-\\beta)]^{\\frac{1}{2}}}= \\frac{(1-\\alpha^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{(1-\\beta^2)^\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{1-v^2/v^2}}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}=\\psi$ ] , where @xmath97 . in order",
    "justify the positive value of @xmath18 ( @xmath98 ) , first of all we will study the dynamics of a particle submitted to a force in the same direction of its motion , so that the new relativistic power in ssr ( @xmath99 ) should be computed to show us that the minimum limit of speed @xmath2 works like an inferior energy barrier , namely @xmath100 .",
    "so when we make such a derivative ( @xmath101 ) of the new momentum @xmath102 ( eq.34 ) , we are able to see an effective energy barrier of @xmath2 , where a vacuum energy of the ultra - referential @xmath17 takes place , governing the dynamics of the massive particles ( section 4 ) .",
    "the transformations shown in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are the direct transformations from @xmath17 [ @xmath103 to @xmath28 [ @xmath104 , where we have @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , so that we obtain the following matrix of transformation :    @xmath107    such that @xmath108 ( lorentz matrix of rotation ) for @xmath53 ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "we should investigate whether the transformations ( 3 ) form a group .",
    "however , such an investigation can form the basis of a further work .",
    "we obtain @xmath110 $ ] , where @xmath111 . since @xmath2 ( @xmath17 ) is unattainable ( @xmath112 , this assures that @xmath113 and therefore the matrix @xmath114 admits inverse ( @xmath115 @xmath116 ) .",
    "however @xmath114 is a non - orthogonal matrix ( @xmath117 ) and so it does not represent a rotation matrix ( @xmath118 ) in such a space - time due to the presence of the privileged frame of background field @xmath17 that breaks strongly the invariance of the norm of the 4-vector of sr ( section 3 ) .",
    "actually such an effect ( @xmath119 for @xmath120 ) emerges from a new relativistic physics of ssr for treating much lower energies at ultra - infrared regime closer to @xmath17 ( very large wavelengths ) .",
    "we notice that @xmath121 is a function of the speed @xmath25 with respect to @xmath17 . in the approximation for @xmath122 ( @xmath123 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath124 and so we practically reinstate the rotational behavior of lorentz matrix as a particular regime for higher energies .",
    "if we make @xmath24 ( @xmath53 ) , we exactly recover @xmath125 .",
    "the inverse transformations ( from @xmath28 to @xmath17 ) are    @xmath126    @xmath127    in matrix form , we have the inverse transformation @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) , so that the inverse matrix is    @xmath130    where we can show that @xmath131=@xmath132 $ ] , so that we must satisfy @xmath133 .",
    "indeed we have @xmath134 and therefore @xmath135 .",
    "this non - orthogonal aspect of @xmath114 has an important physical implication . in order to understand such an implication ,",
    "let us first consider the orthogonal ( e.g : rotation ) aspect of lorentz matrix in sr . under sr , we have @xmath83 , so that @xmath136 .",
    "this symmetry ( @xmath137 , @xmath138 ) happens because the galilean reference frames allow us to exchange the speed @xmath25 ( of @xmath28 ) for @xmath27 ( of @xmath30 ) when we are at rest at @xmath28 .",
    "however , under ssr , since there is no rest at @xmath28 , we can not exchange @xmath25 ( of @xmath28 ) for @xmath27 ( of @xmath17 ) due to that asymmetry ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) . due to this",
    "fact , @xmath17 must be covariant , namely @xmath2 remains invariant for any change of reference frame in such a space - time .",
    "thus we can notice that the paradox of twins , which appears due to the symmetry by exchange of @xmath25 for @xmath27 in sr should be naturally eliminated in ssr , where only the reference frame @xmath28 can move with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "so @xmath17 remains covariant ( invariant for any change of reference frame ) .",
    "we have @xmath139\\rightarrow   [ ( det\\omega)\\psi^{-2}]=[1-\\beta^2(1-\\alpha)^2]$ ] .",
    "so we can alternatively write @xmath131=@xmath132=\\psi^{-1}/[(det\\omega)\\psi^{-2 } ] = \\psi / det\\omega$ ] . by inserting this result in ( 6 ) to replace @xmath131",
    ", we obtain the relationship between the inverse matrix and the transposed matrix of @xmath114 , namely @xmath140 .",
    "indeed @xmath114 is a non - orthogonal matrix , since we have @xmath117 .    according to fig.1 , it is important to notice that a particle moving in one spatial dimension ( @xmath44 ) goes only to right or to left , since the unattainable minimum limit of speed @xmath2 , which represents the spatial aspect of the space - time in ssr , prevents it to stop ( @xmath23 ) in the space .",
    "so it can not return in the same spatial dimension @xmath44 .",
    "on the other hand , in a complementary and symmetric way to @xmath2 , the limit @xmath0 , which represents the temporal aspect of the space - time , prevents to stop the marching of the time ( @xmath141 ) , and so avoiding to come back to the past ( see eq.29 ) . in short , we perceive that the basic ingredient of the space - time structure in ssr , namely the @xmath29 space - time presents @xmath44 and @xmath142 in equal - footing in the sense that both of them are irreversible once the particle is moving to right or to left .",
    "such an equal - footing  @xmath143 \" in ssr does not occurs in sr since we can stop the spatial motion in sr ( @xmath144 ) and so come back in @xmath44 , but not in @xmath142 .",
    "however , if we take into account more than one spatial dimension in ssr , at least two spatial dimensions ( @xmath145 ) , thus the particle could return by moving in the additional ( extra ) dimension(s ) @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "so ssr is able to provide the reason why we must have more than one ( 1 ) spatial dimension for representing movement in reality @xmath45 , although we could have one ( 1 ) spatial dimension just as a good practical approximation for some cases of classical space - time as in sr ( e.g.:a ball moving in a rectilinear path ) .",
    "the reasoning above leads us to conclude that the minimum limit @xmath2 has deep implications for understanding the irreversible aspect of the time connected to the spatial motion in @xmath148 .",
    "such an irreversibility generated by ssr just for @xmath29 ( @xmath143 ) space - time really deserves a deeper treatment in a future research .      in order to obtain general transformations for the case of @xmath45 space - time",
    ", we should replace the one dimensional coordinates @xmath149 and @xmath150 by the @xmath151-vectors @xmath152 and @xmath153 so that we write : @xmath154 , being @xmath155 given in the direction of the motion and @xmath156 is given in the transversal direction of the motion @xmath157 .    at the frame",
    "@xmath28 with velocity @xmath157 , we have the vector @xmath153 , where we generally write : @xmath158 .    in the classical @xmath45 space - time of sr , of course we should have @xmath159 since there is no boost for the transversal direction , so that the modulus of @xmath156 is always preserved for any reference frame .",
    "however , for @xmath45 space - time of ssr , there should be a transformation of the transversal vector such that @xmath160 .",
    "so let us admit the following transformation : @xmath161 , where @xmath34 .",
    "such a non - classical effect occurs only due to the existence of a minimum speed @xmath2 given for any direction in the space , so that even the transversal direction could not be neglected , i.e. , in ssr there should be a transformation for the vector at the transversal direction of the motion .",
    "therefore , only if the speed @xmath25 is closer to @xmath2 , a drastic dilation of @xmath162 occurs , that is to say @xmath163 when @xmath36 .",
    "such a transversal dilation that occurs only close to the ultra - referential @xmath17 shows us the 3-dimensional aspect of the background frame connected to @xmath17 , which could not be simply reduced to 1-dimensional space since @xmath2 should remain invariant for any direction in the space .",
    "so , at the frame @xmath28 , we have    @xmath164    where @xmath165 .    as the direction of motion ( @xmath155 )",
    "transforms in a similar way to the equation ( 1 ) for 1-dimensional case , we simply write ( 7 ) , as follows :    @xmath166,\\ ] ]    where we simply have @xmath167 , being @xmath155 parallel to @xmath157 .",
    "we have @xmath168 and @xmath34 .    from ( 8)",
    ", we can see that @xmath57 appears as a multiplicative factor .",
    "of course , if we make @xmath83 ( @xmath22 ) in ( 8) , this implies @xmath62 and so we recover the well - known lorentz tranformation of the 3-vector .",
    "we write @xmath169 .",
    "so by introducing this information into ( 8) and performing the calculations , we find :    @xmath170\\ ] ]    we have @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the unitary vector in the direction of motion , i.e. , @xmath173 .",
    "angle @xmath174 is formed between the direction of @xmath152 and @xmath172 . on the other hand , we can write : @xmath175 .",
    "finally we get @xmath176 .",

    ", we can verify that , if we consider @xmath157 to be in the same direction of @xmath152 , being @xmath178 , we obtain @xmath179 . so the transformation ( 10 )",
    "is reduced to @xmath180=\\theta\\gamma(x - v(1-\\alpha)t)$ ] , where @xmath168 .",
    "such a transformation is exactly the transformation ( 1 ) for the case of @xmath29 space - time .",

    "actually the dilatation factor @xmath221 appears due to the presence of the privileged frame @xmath17 as a background field being inherent to the deformed metric @xmath233 .",
    "thus the transformations in such a space - time of ssr do not necessarily form a group .",
    "this subject will be treated in a further work .",
    "the presence of the dilatation factor @xmath221 affects directly the proper time of the moving particle at @xmath28 , which becomes a variable parameter in ssr , in the sense that , just close to @xmath2 , there emerges a dilatation of the proper time interval @xmath215 in relation to the improper one @xmath234 , namely @xmath235 . in short ,",
    "such a new relativistic effect in ssr shows us that the proper time interval becomes a variable and deformable parameter connected to the motion @xmath25 , as well as the improper time interval is deformable , namely the so - called _ time dilatation_.    in ssr , due to the connection between the proper time interval and the motion , let us call @xmath236 ( at @xmath28 ) to represent an intrinsic variable of proper time interval depending on the motion @xmath25 .",
    "of course for @xmath122 , we expect that such a dependence can be neglected , recovering the proper time of sr .",
    "but , close to @xmath2 , the new effect of the dilatation of @xmath236 in relation to @xmath234 ( @xmath237 ) emerges , and it is due to the dilatation factor @xmath238 .",
    "so according to ( 23 ) we find the following equivalence of dilated space - time intervals :    @xmath239\\equiv ds_v^{\\prime 2}=c^2d\\tau_v^2,\\ ] ]    being @xmath240 . here",
    "we have made @xmath241 .",
    "if we make @xmath24 ( no ultra - referential @xmath17 ) or even @xmath122 ( @xmath227 ) , we recover the well - known equivalence ( invariance ) of intervals in sr ( see ( 21 ) ) .",
    "as the deformed metric @xmath242 of ssr depends on velocity , it seems to be related to a kind of finsler metric , namely a finslerian ( non - riemannian ) space with a metric depending on position and velocity , that is , @xmath243@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "of course , if there is no dependence on velocity , the finsler space turns out to be a riemannian space .",
    "such a possible connection between @xmath242 and finslerian geometry should be investigated .    from ( 25 ) we obtain    @xmath244    which finally leads to    @xmath245    equation 27 reveals a perfect symmetry ( @xmath246 ) in the sense that both intervals of time @xmath234 and @xmath215 can dilate , namely @xmath234 dilates for @xmath216 and , on the other hand , @xmath215 dilates for @xmath36 .",
    "but , if @xmath24 , we break such a symmetry of ssr and so we recover the well - known time equation ( eq.22 ) of sr , where only @xmath234 dilates .    for the sake of simplicity , we simply use the notation @xmath215 ( @xmath247 ) for representing the proper time interval in the time equation of ssr ( eq.27 ) .    from ( 27 )",
    "we notice that , if we make @xmath248 ( a geometric average between @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) , we exactly find the equality @xmath249 , namely a newtonian result where the time intervals are the same .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath250 represents a special intermediate speed in ssr ( @xmath251 ) such that , if :    \\a ) @xmath252 ( or even @xmath216 ) , we get @xmath253 . this is the well - known _ improper time dilatation_.    \\b ) @xmath254 ( or even @xmath36 ) , we get @xmath255 .",
    "let us call such a new effect as _ improper time contraction _ or _",
    "dilatation of the proper time interval @xmath215 in relation to the improper time interval @xmath234_. this effect is more evident only for @xmath36 , so that we have @xmath256 for @xmath234 fixed ( see eq.27 ) . in other words",
    "this means that the proper time elapses faster than the improper one closer to @xmath2 .    in ssr , it is interesting to notice that we restore the newtonian regime when @xmath257 , which represents an intermediary regime of speeds so that we get the newtonian approximation from equation 27 , i.e. , @xmath258 .",

    "the hypotenuse of the triangle is @xmath262 representing the spatio - temporal speed of any particle .     ,",

    "when @xmath23 , the horizontal leg vanishes ( no spatial speed ) and so the vertical leg becomes maximum ( @xmath266 ) .",
    "however , according to ssr , due to the existence of a minimum limit of spatial speed ( @xmath2 ) , we can never nullify the horizontal leg , so that the maximum temporal speed ( maximum vertical leg ) is @xmath267 . on the other hand @xmath263 ( the vertical leg )",
    "can not be zero since @xmath14 is forbidden for massive particles .",
    "so we conclude that a rectangular triangle is always preserved since both temporal and spatial speeds can not vanish and so they always coexist , providing a strong symmetry of ssr . ]",

    "if we make @xmath24 and @xmath308 in ( 38 ) , we simply recover the power obtained in newtonian mechanics , namely @xmath309 .",
    "now , if we just consider @xmath24 in ( 38 ) , we recover the well - known relativistic power ( sr ) , namely @xmath310 .",
    "we notice that such a relativistic power tends to infinite ( @xmath311 ) in the limit @xmath216 .",
    "we explain this result as an effect of the drastic increase of an effective inertial mass close to @xmath0 , namely @xmath312 , where @xmath313 .",
    "we must stress that such an effective inertial mass is the response to an applied force parallel to the motion according to newton second law , and it increases faster than the relativistic mass @xmath314 .",
    "the effective inertial mass @xmath315 we have obtained is a longitudinal mass @xmath316 , i.e. , it is a response to the force applied in the direction of motion . in sr , for the case where the force is perpendicular to velocity , we can show that the transversal mass increases like the relativistic mass , i.e. , @xmath317 , which differs from the longitudinal mass @xmath318 .",
    "so in this sense there is anisotropy of the effective inertial mass to be also investigated in more details by ssr in a further work .",
    "the mysterious discrepancy between the relativistic mass @xmath319 ( @xmath320 ) and the longitudinal inertial mass @xmath316 from newton second law ( eq.38 ) is a controversial issue@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "actually the newtonian notion about inertia as the resistance to acceleration ( @xmath316 ) is not compatible with the relativistic dynamics ( @xmath320 ) in the sense that we generally can not consider @xmath321 .",
    "the dynamics of ssr aims to give us a new interpretation for the inertia of the newtonian point of view in order to make it compatible with the relativistic mass .",
    "this compatibility will be possible just due to the influence of the background field that couples to the particle and  dresses \" its relativistic mass in order to generate an effective ( dressed ) mass in accordance with the newtonian notion about inertia ( from eqs.37 and 38 ) .",
    "this issue will be clarified in this section .    from ( 38 ) , it is important to observe that , when we are closer to @xmath2 , there emerges a completely new result ( correction ) for power , namely :    @xmath322    given in the approximation @xmath323 .",
    "so we notice that @xmath311 when @xmath323 .",
    "we can also make the limit @xmath36 for the general case ( eq.38 ) and so we obtain an infinite power ( @xmath311 ) .",
    "such a new relativistic effect deserves the following very important comment : although we are in the limit of very low energies close to @xmath2 , where the energy of the particle ( @xmath324 ) tends to zero according to the approximation @xmath325 with @xmath94 ( make the approximation @xmath323 for eq.33 ) , on the other hand the power given in ( 39 ) shows us that there is an effective inertial mass that increases to infinite in the limit @xmath36 , that is to say , from ( 39 ) we get the effective mass @xmath326 , where @xmath327 .",
    "therefore , from a dynamical point of view , the negative exponent @xmath328 ( @xmath329 ) for power at very low velocities ( eq.39 ) is responsible for the inferior barrier of the minimum speed @xmath2 , as well as the exponent @xmath313 of the well - known relativistic power is responsible for the top barrier of the speed of light @xmath0 according to newton second law .    in order to see clearly",
    "both exponents @xmath327 ( inferior inertial barrier @xmath2 ) and @xmath313 ( top inertial barrier @xmath0 ) , let us write the general formula of power ( eq.38 ) in the following alternative way after some algebraic manipulations on it , namely :    @xmath330    where @xmath327 and @xmath313 .",
    "now it is easy to see that , if @xmath323 or even @xmath6 , eq.40 recovers the approximation ( 39 ) . as @xmath331 , the ratio @xmath332 in ( 40 ) is a very small dimensionless constant@xcite .",
    "so it could be neglected .    from ( 40 )",
    "we get the effective inertial mass @xmath333 of ssr , namely :    @xmath334    we must stress that @xmath333 in ( 41 ) is a longitudinal mass @xmath316 . the problem of mass anisotropy will be treated elsewhere , where we will intend to show that , just for the approximation @xmath323 , the effective inertial mass becomes practically isotropic , that is to say @xmath335 .",
    "this important result will show us the isotropic aspect of the vacuum-@xmath17 so that the inferior barrier @xmath2 has the same behavior of response ( @xmath327 ) for any direction in the space , namely for any angle between the applied force and the velocity of the particle .    we must point out the fact that @xmath333 has nothing to do with the  relativistic mass \" ( relativistic energy @xmath289 in eq.33 ) in the sense that @xmath333 is dynamically responsible for both barriers @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the discrepancy between the  relativistic mass \" ( energy @xmath324 of the particle ) and such an effective inertial mass ( @xmath333 ) can be interpreted under ssr theory , as follows : @xmath333 is a dressed inertial mass given in response to the presence of the vacuum-@xmath17 that works like a kind of  fluid \" in which the particle @xmath336 is immersed , while the  relativistic mass \" in ssr ( eq.33 ) works like a bare inertial mass in the sense that it is not considered to be under the dynamical influence of the  fluid \" connected to the vacuum-@xmath17 .",
    "that is the reason why the exponent @xmath94 in eq.33 can not be used to explain the existence of an infinite inferior barrier at @xmath2 , namely the vacuum-@xmath17 barrier is governed by the exponent @xmath327 as shown in ( 39 ) , ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) , which prevents that @xmath337 .",
    "the difference betweeen the dressed ( effective ) mass and the relativistic ( bare ) mass , i.e. , @xmath338 represents an interactive increment of mass @xmath339 that has purely origin from the vacuum energy-@xmath17 , mamely    @xmath340\\ ] ]    we have @xmath341 , being @xmath342 given in eq.41 and @xmath319 ( @xmath320 ) given in eq.33 .    from ( 42 )",

    "the approximation ( 44 ) shows that the whole dressed mass has purely origin from the energy of vacuum-@xmath17 , being @xmath347 the pure increment @xmath339 , since the bare ( relativistic ) mass @xmath319 of the own particle almost vanishes in such a regime ( @xmath323 ) , and thus an inertial effect only due to the vacuum (  fluid\")-@xmath17 remains .",

    "in such a regime the particle practically loses its locality (  identity \" ) in the sense that it is spread out isotropically in the whole space and it becomes strongly coupled to the vacuum field-@xmath17 , leading to an infinite value of @xmath339 .",
    "such a divergence has origin from the dilatation factor @xmath361 for this regime ( @xmath323 ) , so that we can rewrite ( 44 ) in the following way : @xmath362 .",

    "<S> such a limit , unattainable by the particles , represents a preferred inertial reference frame associated with a cosmological background field that breaks lorentz symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> so there emerges a modified relativistic dynamics with a minimum speed related to the planck length of the early universe , which leads us to search for a quantum gravity at low energies . </S>"
