    "[ secint ]    odd - even staggering of isotope shifts is a common phenomena observed in many isotopic chains @xcite .",
    "the results are interpreted as due to changes in the charge radii of these isotopes , i.e. , charge radii of odd - neutron nuclei are smaller than the average radii of their even neighbors @xcite .",
    "probable mechanisms so far presented for odd - even staggering of isotope shifts are ; core polarization by valence neutrons @xcite , and mean field effects of a three - body ( or a density - dependent ) pairing force .",
    "core polarization effects were first investigated by talmi @xcite as a possible mechanism for producing odd - even staggering of isotope shifts .",
    "he could show a remarkably good fitting to changes in the charge radii of ca isotopes , though it is not certain whether the shell model calculation with a realistic force can reproduce absolute magnitude of isotope shifts .",
    "an alternative mechanism was suggested by zawischa et al .",
    "they have demonstrated the importance of a density dependent pairing as well as mean field effects of the pairing on the odd - even staggering of isotope shifts .",
    "they could obtain good fitting to changes in the charge radii of ca , ba , sn , and pb isotopes .    in this paper",
    "we investigate in detail the latter possibility employing the hfb theory with axially - symmetric deformation .",
    "we assume the skyrme sly4 parameterization@xcite and the delta - force pairing with linear density dependence @xcite .",
    "we solve hfb equations in the canonical basis@xcite .",
    "odd nuclei are treated in the blocking approximation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review some theoretical formalism useful for our purposes . in section 3",

    "summary and conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "[ secfor ]    we follow the hfb scheme prescribed by reinhard et al @xcite .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian ,    @xmath0    @xmath1    here @xmath2 is the skyrme force and @xmath3 is the density - dependent delta - force pairing @xcite .",
    "the pairing force involves two parameters , i.e. , @xmath4 sets the strength of the force and @xmath5 determines its spatial dependence .",
    "the bcs ansatz for the wave function of a pairing many - body system    @xmath6    requires that the single particle states are orthonormalized and that occupations add up to the total particle number @xmath7 .",

    "it is always repulsive and arises only from the density dependent pairing . on the other hand ,",
    "the gap potential depends on the charge state _",

    "depends on the state _ i_. it is not hermitian in contrast to hf + bcs calculations .",

    "the parameters were specifically devised to reproduce correct incompressibility modulus for the symmetric nuclear matter and to improve the isospin property of the force away from the @xmath39-stability line .",
    "these features of the sly4 force are especially favorable to the calculation of charge radii along a long isotopic chain .",
    "however , the sly4 paramaters were determined without the pairing correlation and therefore they would have to be modified when they are used in hfb calculations . with the pairing parameters discussed in the next paragraph , it turns out that pair mean - fields contribute to hf + bcs results of sn , pb , ba , and yb isotopes by an order of ten kev and the gap potentials by an order of hundred kev .",
    "gap potentials have non - negligible effects on the odd - even mass difference of isotopes .",

    "we take into account all bound levels with energies lower than @xmath43 + 1@xmath44 , where @xmath43 is the fermi energy and 1@xmath45 = 41a@xmath46 mev . with this prescription , however , we have encountered a problem of convergence . in each step of iterations ,",
    "some of the highest levels go in and out from the active pairing space , which give rise to an oscillation of the binding energy .",
    "thus for the first few hundred iterations , we excluded the gap potential from the mean field hamiltonian and solved the equation by diagonalization .",
    "after having had a pretty good convergence , we fixed the number of single - particle levels of the active pairing space and solved the full mean - field equation by employing the gradient step .",
    "we have also studied the cut - off prescription of bonche et al . @xcite . with their prescription , however , we could not reproduce odd - even staggering in light ba isotopes if we included the positive evergy levels in the active pairing space . except for this difficulty ,",
    "our cut - off prescription gives similar results to those of bonche et al .",

    "indeed , we can not predict odd - even staggering of charge radii within a framework of ordinary hf + bcs theory , even if we employ the density dependent pairing in the calculation . we need to take into account mean fields of the pairing to explain the phenomena .",

    "the potential works especially well for heavy sn isotopes . reminding that fig .",
    "1(c ) is the full hfb calculation where the pair mean - field and the gap potential are both included in the hamiltonian , we may conclude that the pair mean - field as well as the gap potential are both responsible for the occurence of odd - even staggering of sn isotopes .",

    "2(e ) shows the neutron gap potentials of the same nuclei . in these figures",
    "we show monopole radial shapes of the potentials in the legendre expantion . from fig .",
    "2(d ) we see that the pair mean - field is repulsive inside a nucleus .",
    "the repulsive potential causes a shallow hf field and thus the nucleus expands .",
    "since an even nucleus has a stronger pair mean - field than its odd neighbors , the charge radius of the even nucleus expands more than its odd neighbors .",
    "the same is true for the gap potential .",
    "2(e ) shows that the gap potential is repulsive inside a nucleus while it is attractive at the nuclear surface .",
    "the potential too , expands the nucleus .",
    "the potential is also stronger for an even nucleus than its odd neighbors , leading to a larger charge radius for the even nucleus than its odd neighbors .",
    "it is noted that the pair mean - field has a larger effect than the gap potential on the odd - even staggering of isotope shifts . this is because that the pair mean - field exists in the proton hf field even for proton closed - shell nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "the proton gap - potential vanishes for the proton closed - shell nuclei . for such nuclei",

    ", in contrast to sn isotopes , the isotopic chain of pb extends beyond the neutron shell closure at n=126 . at the shell closure",
    "we see in fig .",
    "3(b ) an abrupt change of charge - radius differences , which is called a `` kink '' .",
    "we have also investigated mean field effects of the pairing on the kink of pb isotopes .",
    "mean fields of the pairing get stronger as an isotope goes away from @xmath66pb and strong mean fields could give rise to a larger charge radius . if this is the case , changes in the charge radii of pb isotopes would be small for nuclei lighter than @xmath66pb , while they would be large for nuclei heavier than @xmath66pb .",
    "3(b ) shows isotopic shifts of pb nuclei from our calculation , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory @xcite , and experiment .",
    "our calculation could not predict large enough isotope shifts for nuclei beyond @xmath66pb . indeed",
    "our calculation is very similar to the hf + bcs calculation without the mean field effects of the pairing .",
    "mean fields of the pairing seem to have only marginal effects on the occurence of the kink around @xmath66pb .",
    "the kink around @xmath66pb may be primarily due to the shell structures in this region of nuclei .",
    "the 2g@xmath67 neutron level lying close to the continuum seems to be the key to the occurence of the kink .",
    "indeed the kink is well reproduced with the rmf calculation@xcite .",
    "the kink is also reproduced with a nonrelativistic skyrme calculation by omitting the fock term of the spin - orbit interaction@xcite or by assuming the isospin dependence in the spin - orbit energy functional@xcite .",

    "4(c ) shows odd - even staggering of ba isotopes .",
    "agreement with experiment is in general good .",
    "the kink in ba isotopes may be due to changes in the nuclear deformation .",
    "proton shells of ba nuclei are not closed and therefore most ba nuclei are soft against nuclear deformation .",
    "4(d ) shows calculated quadrupole moments which agree well with experiment @xcite .",
    "as seen from this figure , the deformation decreases as the neutron number increases toward @xmath68ba and then the deformation increases beyond @xmath68ba .",
    "thus changes in the charge radii are small for nuclei lighter than @xmath68ba , while they are large for nuclei heavier than @xmath68ba .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "4(b ) that our calculation reproduces the kink fairly well , though the deviation from experiment becomes appreciable in the region of light ba isotopes .    at this point",
    "we wish to mention the reason why we have employed a small density parameter = 0.140 @xmath42 for the pairing instead of the saturation density = 0.160 @xmath42 . fig .",

    "6 , we show neutron separation energies of yb isotopes .",
    "agreement with experiment is good . figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) show changes in the charge radii of yb isotopes . in this case",
    ", however , agreement with experiment is rather poor especially for nuclei lighter than @xmath70yb .",
    "our calculation suggests that odd - even staggering in the charge radii of yb isotopes might be related to the odd - even staggering of nuclear deformation of these nuclei . for nuclei lighter than @xmath70yb ,",
    "a larger deformation is calculated for an even isotope than its odd neighbors .",
    "the difference is enough to explain the odd - even sttagering of charge radii of these nuclei . for nuclei heavier than @xmath70yb , however , a larger deformation is calculated for an odd nucleus than its even neighbors .",
    "mean fields of the pairing and nuclear deformation have opposite effects on the charge radii , leading to a rather complicated behavier of isotopic shifts in this region of nuclei .",

    "one is the pair mean - field which comes from the density dependent part of the pairing .",
    "the pair mean - field does not depend on the charge state and therefore the same form of the pair mean - field appears in the hf fields of protons and neutrons . in addition , the potential exists even for proton closed - shell nuclei .",
    "the other is the gap potential which arises from the variation of the pairing density in the pairing energy functional .",
    "therefore the gap potential arises also from the density independent pairing .",
