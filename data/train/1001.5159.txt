    "with the quantum theory , as it was called at the time , nearing it first centennial anniversary , it is a rare opportunity to study an one - dimensional ideal oscillator which has not been solved long ago .",
    "the motion of a ( non - relativistic ) quantum particle with a linear dispersion , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the momentum and @xmath3 is a parameter , in a linearly confining potential @xmath4 again a parameter , however , appears to provide an example .",
    "while the problem may look trivial at first , it is not .",
    "the usual method of quantization by replacing either @xmath5 or @xmath6 can not be applied directly , as one can not sensibly define the absolute value of a differential operator .",
    "the problem is not just of academic interest , but even of relevance to a recent experiment  @xcite .",
    "spinons , the fractionally quantized and elementary excitations in antiferromagnetic spin chains , are well known to disperse linearly at low energies , with @xmath3 proportional to the antiferromagnetic exchange constant @xmath7 along the chains  @xcite .",
    "spinons carry the spin of an electron but no charge .",
    "since the antiparticle for a spinon is just another spinon with its spin reversed , the spectrum has only a positive energy branch .",
    "an one couples two chains antiferromagnetically  @xcite , the coupling @xmath8 will induce a linear confinement potential between pairs of spinons , as the rungs between two spinons become effectively decorrelated  @xcite . to a very first approximation , the energy gap in the spin ladder is hence given by the ground state energy of the bi - linear oscillator @xmath9 which we study in this article .",
    "the ground state is symmetric under one - dimensional parity @xmath10 and corresponds to a spinon pair in the triplet channel , while the first excited state is antisymmetric under @xmath10 corresponds to the lowest singlet excitation in the spin ladder .",
    "it the context of this problem , it is hence desirable to know what the lowest eigenvalues of are . from dimensional considerations , it is immediately clear that they must scale like @xmath11 .",
    "even though the usual method of quantization can not be applied directly , the problem can still be approached quasi - classically . applying the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition  @xcite @xmath12 where we are supposed to integrate over the entire classical orbit , results with @xmath13 in @xmath14 carrying out the integration yields @xmath15 we expect this to constitute a reasonable approximation for the higher energy levels , but probably not for the low lying ones .",
    "indeed , this is what we will find as we solve the problem numerically below .",
    "before proceeding with the numerical solution , let us rewrite the eigenvalue equation @xmath16 as a differential ( and integral ) equation in position space . for convenience , we consider the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath17 which is obtained from by rescaling @xmath18 let us denote the eigenvalues of by @xmath19 and the eigenfunctions by @xmath20 . with @xmath21 we may write @xmath22\\nonumber    & = & -i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x }     \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\text{sign}(k)\\ ,    \\tilde\\phi(k)e^{ikx}dk \\\\[3pt ]    & = & -i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x }    \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\tilde s(x - x')\\,\\phi(x ' ) dx',\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the sign function and @xmath24    & = & \\frac{2i}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{x}{x^2+\\epsilon^2 }    \\,=\\frac{2i}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\,\\mathcal{p}\\frac{1}{x},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the principal part , is the fourier transform thereof .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath20 with eigenvalues @xmath19 of are hence the solutions of @xmath26 while provides a clear mathematical formulation of the problem , we are not aware of any method to solve it analytically , nor consider it a viable starting point for numerical work .",
    "to solve numerically , we exactly diagonalize a finite hamiltonian matrix we obtain through discretization of position space with a suitably chosen cutoff .",
    "let this discrete hilbert space consist of @xmath27 sites , with the positions @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the lattice constant .",
    "the cutoff @xmath31 in real space implies a cutoff @xmath32 for the potential energy in , which must be chosen significantly larger than the largest eigenvalue @xmath33 we wish to evaluate reliably .",
    "( from , we expect @xmath33 to be of order @xmath34 . ) on the other hand , the classically allowed part of the hilbert space will contain only of the order of @xmath35 sites for the ground state , which implies that we must further require @xmath36 .",
    "the lattice provides us simultaneously with a cutoff in momentum space , @xmath37 .",
    "we may hence expand @xmath38 in a fourier series , @xmath39 with @xmath40 as one may easily verify through integration by parts .",
    "we proceed by writing in second quantized notation , @xmath41 where @xmath42 since @xmath43 we obtain @xmath44 with @xmath45      - \\frac{n}{2\\lambda_c}\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\frac{1}{(i - j)^2}&i - j\\ \\text{odd}\\\\[3pt ]      0                            & \\text{otherwise } ,    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where we have substituted @xmath46 for @xmath30 .",

    "comparisons of these fits to the numerically obtained eigenfunctions are shown in figure [ fig : psi - approx ] .",
    "the fits are not as good an approximation as figure [ fig : psi - approx ] may suggest , however , as they fall off as @xmath62 while the true eigenfunctions @xmath63 fall off as @xmath64 for @xmath52 even and as @xmath65 for @xmath52 odd as @xmath66 .    this asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions can be understood physically through second order perturbation theory .",
    "if we consider a small region around a point @xmath67 ( very far away from the classically allowed region for the eigenstate with energy @xmath19 ) , the amplitude there will be governed by scattering into this region from the classically allowed region , which contains almost the entire amplitude of the state . from , this scattering is proportional to @xmath68      \\frac{1}{x^3 }   & n\\ \\text{odd } ,    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a cutoff to insure that we include the tail immediately surrounding the classically allowed region in the integral ( from figs .",

    "a few thoughts on this problem , however , are possibly worth mentioning .",
    "as the hamiltonian maps onto itself under fourier transformation , and all the eigenstates are non - degenerate , the eigenfunctions @xmath20 must likewise map into itself under fourier transformation , @xmath76 this condition is directly fulfilled by certain functions , like the gaussian eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator @xmath77 , @xmath78 or the function @xmath79 the eigenfunctions of , however , do not need to be of any such particular form .",

    "it is conceivable that the function @xmath82 displays the required asymptotic behavior mentioned above , while the fourier transform @xmath83 falls off more rapidly . a first guess for the ground state along these lines might be @xmath84 with its fourier",
