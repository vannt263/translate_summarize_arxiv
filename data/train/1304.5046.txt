    "a large proportion of fish species are characterized by elongated bodies that swim forward by flapping sideways .",
    "these sideways oscillations produce periodic propulsive forces that cause the fish to swim along time - periodic trajectories ,  @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the flapping motion and the resulting swimming performance , as well as their relationship to the swimmer s morphology , have been the subject of numerous studies , see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "however , little attention has been given to the stability of underwater locomotion .",
    "the importance of motion stability and its mutual influence on body morphology and behavior is noted in the work of weihs , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "weihs uses clever arguments and simplifying approximations founded on a deep understanding of the equations governing underwater locomotion to obtain  educated estimates \" of the stability of swimming fish without ever solving the complicated set of equations .",
    "the swimming motion is said to be unstable if a perturbation in the conditions surrounding the swimmer s body result in forces and moments that tend to increase the perturbation , and it is stable if these emerging forces tend to reduce such perturbations or keep them bounded so that the fish returns to or stays near its original periodic swimming .    stability may be achieved actively or passively .",
    "active stabilization requires neurological control that activate musculo - skeletal components to compensate for external perturbations acting against stability . on the other hand , passive stability of the locomotion gaits requires no additional energy input by the fish . in this sense",
    ", one can argue that stability reduces the energetic cost of locomotion .",
    "therefore , from an evolutionary perspective , it seems reasonable to conjecture that stability would have a positive selection value in behaviors such as migration over prolonged distances and time .",
    "however , stability limits maneuverability and body designs / flapping motions that are adapted for stable swimming are not suitable for high maneuverability and vice versa ,  @xcite .    in this work , we study stability of periodic swimming using a simple model consisting of a planar elliptic body undergoing prescribed flapping motion in unbounded potential flow . by flapping motion ,",
    "we mean periodic heaving and pitching of the body as shown in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "we formulate the equations of motion governing the resulting locomotion and examine its efficiency .",
    "we then investigate the stability of this motion using floquet theory ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we find that stability depends in a non - trivial way on the body geometry ( aspect ratio of the ellipse ) as well as on the amplitudes and phases of the flapping motion .",
    "most remarkable is the ability of the system to transition from stability to instability and back to stability as we vary some of these parameters .",
    "this model is reminiscent of the three - link swimmer used by kanso _",
    "_ to examine periodic locomotion in potential flow , see  @xcite .",
    "the three - link swimmer undergoes periodic shape deformations that result in coupled heaving , pitching and locomotion . here",
    ", we ignore body deformations for the sake of simplicity and prescribe the heaving and pitching motion directly .",
    "note that the three - link swimmer was also used by jing & kanso to study the effect of body elasticity on the stability of the coast motion of fish ( motion at constant speed ) .",
    "they found that elasticity of the body may lead to passive stabilization of the ( otherwise unstable ) coast motion , see  @xcite .",
    "the present model consisting of a single elliptic body is mostly similar to the system studied by spagnolie _",
    "( 2010 ) both experimentally and numerically , see  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "an elliptic body undergoes passive pitching ( via a torsional spring ) subject to prescribed periodic heaving in viscous fluid , whereas in our model both the pitching and heaving motions are prescribed and the fluid medium is inviscid . despite these differences , the two models exhibit qualitatively similar behavior as discussed in section  [ sec : discussion_and_conclusion ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : problem_setup ] , we formulate the equations of motion governing the locomotion of a periodically flapping body in unbounded potential flow .",
    "we analyze the body s locomotion and efficiency when subject to small amplitude flapping motion in section  [ sec : small_amplitude_actuations ] , and consider the more general case of finite amplitude flapping in section  [ sec : locomotion ] . in section  [ sec : stability_of_periodic_solution ] , we assess the stability of the periodic locomotion using floquet theory . the main findings and their relevance to biolocomotion are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion_and_conclusion ] .",

    "<S> we obtain closed - form solutions for the locomotion and efficiency for small flapping amplitudes , and numerical results for finite flapping amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we then study the stability of the ( finite amplitude flapping ) periodic locomotion using floquet theory . </S>",
    "<S> we find that stability depends nonlinearly on all parameters . </S>",
    "<S> interesting trends of switching between stable and unstable motions emerge and evolve as we continuously vary the parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , for live organisms that control their flapping motion , maneuverability and stability need not be thought of as disjoint properties , rather the organism may manipulate its motion in favor of one or the other depending on the task at hand . </S>"
