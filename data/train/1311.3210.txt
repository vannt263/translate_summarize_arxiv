    "the calculation of properties of an inhomogeneous interacting quantum system requires adequate care regarding a proper description of its spatial structure : for a lattice model the resolution of a potential landscape , without generating additional finite size effects , typically requires an extension of @xmath2 sites per spatial dimension .",
    "if , in addition , the strength of interactions can not be regarded as ` weak ' , a reasonable approximation scheme must involve detailed information about higher order correlations .",
    "this usually demands a huge effort for modern computers , both in memory and speed .",
    "thus , for a system with non - trivial spatial structure any approximation scheme necessarily involves a tradeoff between computational feasibility and accuracy . in ref .",
    ", we introduced such a scheme , both reasonably fast and accurate up to intermediate interaction strength , within the framework of the one - particle irreducible version of the functional renormalization group ( frg).@xcite the goal of this paper is to supply a detailed description of this approximation scheme , called the coupled - ladder approximation ( cla ) , which is implemented within the context of generic , third - order - truncated frg . in the latter , the flow of the three - particle vertex is set to zero , while the flow equation of the two - particle vertex ( which we will call `` vertex flow '' in the following ) is fully incorporated .",
    "this vertex flow has to be incorporated if interactions can not be considered small . in general",
    ", this constitutes a computational challenge , since the vertex generated by this flow involves a large number @xmath3 of independent functions , each depending on three frequencies , where @xmath1 is the number of sites of the interacting region . as a result ,",
    "the flow equations involve @xmath4 independent variables , where @xmath5 is the number of discrete points per frequency used in the numerics .",
    "previous schemes that included the vertex flow for models with large @xmath1 made use of an additional symmetry , e.g. ref .   described systems with a weak spatial inhomogeneity ( either changing adiabatically with position , or confined to a small region ) , which could be treated as a perturbation , so that its feedback to the vertex could be neglected . the resulting equations for the vertex",
    "were solved in the momentum basis , exploiting the fact that the single - particle eigenstates could approximately be represented by plane waves . however",
    ", this is not possible for models with strong inhomogeneities .",
    "our cla scheme was developed to include the vertex flow for such models .",
    "it extends the idea of refs .  and  , where the cla was introduced to parametrize the frequency dependence of the vertex for the single - impurity anderson model , i.e. @xmath6 , which reduces the number of independent variables for that model to @xmath7 .",
    "we show that the cla can be applied to parametrize the spatial dependence of the vertex for models with a purely local interaction .",
    "the number of independent variables that represent the spatial dependence of the vertex then reduces to @xmath8 , and the total number of independent variables representing the vertex to @xmath9 .",
    "the cla scheme is exact to second order@xcite and effectively sums up diagrams of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) of all three interaction channels .    to illustrate the capabilities of our cla scheme",
    ", we apply it , as in ref .  , to a one - dimensional chain modeling the lowest submode of a quantum point contact ( qpc ) , a short constriction that allows transport only in one dimension .",
    "its conductance is famously quantized@xcite in units of @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to this quantization , measured conductance curves show a shoulder at around @xmath11 . in this",
    "regime quantities such as electrical and thermal conductance , noise and thermo - power have anomalous behavior@xcite .",
    "these phenomena are collectively known as the `` 0.7-anomaly '' in qpcs .    in ref .",
    "we showed that the 0.7-anomaly is reproduced by a one - dimensional model with a parabolic potential barrier and a short - ranged coulomb interaction .",
    "we presented a detailed microscopic picture that explained the physical mechanism which causes the anomalous behavior .",
    "its origin is a smeared van hove singularity in the density of states ( dos ) just above the band bottom which enhances effects of interaction causing an enhanced backscattering .",
    "we presented detailed results for the conductance at zero temperature , obtained using frg in the cla .",
    "these numerical data were in good qualitative agreement with our experimental measurements and showed that the model reproduces the phenomenology of the 0.7-anomaly . in this paper",
    "we set forth and examine the approximation scheme in detail .",
    "we present additional numerical data to verify the reliability of the method for the case where it is applied to the model of a qpc . for this",
    "we present and compare data obtained by different approximation schemes within the frg , showing that the phenomenology is very robust , and can even be obtained by neglecting the vertex flow .",
    "however including the vertex flow using the cla reduces artifacts and gives an insightful view on the spin susceptibility .",
    "for the latter , we finally present a detailed quantitative error analysis .",
    "the approximation scheme presented in this paper can be applied to any model hamiltonian that can be written in the following form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a real , symmetric matrix , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath16 with spin @xmath17 ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 , with @xmath20 ) , and",
    "@xmath21 counts them ( in general @xmath16 can represent any quantum number , however for simplicity we refer to it as a site index throughout the paper ) . in order to apply the cla",
    "the necessary property of this hamiltonian is a short - ranged interaction . in principle",
    "the approximation scheme can be set up for an interaction with finite range ( over several sites ) , however since the structure then becomes very complicated we will only discuss the case of a purely local , i.e. , on - site interaction in this paper as given by eq .  .",
    "whereas the system can extend to infinity , it is crucial that the number of sites @xmath1 where @xmath22 is nonzero is finite and not too large , as discussed in section  [ secnumericimplementation ] .",
    "if the system is extended to infinity , the effect of the noninteracting region can be calculated analytically using the projection method ( see appendix sec .  [ secprojection ] and refs .  and  ) .",
    "an extension to a hamiltonian that is complex hermitian and non - diagonal in spin space , needed , e.g. , to include spin - orbit effects , is straightforward .",
    "in contrast applying the scheme to spin less models , for which the interaction term has to be non - local to respect pauli s exclusion principle , is more complicated .",
    "in this section we describe the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach that we have employed to treat a translationally nonuniform fermi system with onsite interactions , such as described by eq .  .",
    "we use the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) version of the frg@xcite .",
    "its key idea is to approximately sum up a perturbative expansion , in our case in the interaction , by setting up and numerically solving a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , the _ flow equations _",
    ", for the system s 1pi @xmath23-particle vertex functions , @xmath24 .",
    "this is typically done in such a way that the effects of higher - energy modes , lying above a flowing infrared cutoff parameter @xmath25 , are incorporated before those of lower - energy modes lying below @xmath25 .",
    "this yields a systematic way of summing up parquet - type diagrams for the two - particle vertex and for calculating the self - energy .",
    "@xmath25 serves as _ flow parameter _ that controls the rg flow of the @xmath25-dependent vertex functions @xmath26 from an initial cutoff @xmath27 , at which all vertex functions are known and simple , to a final cutoff @xmath28 , at which the full theory is recovered .",
    "this idea is implemented by replacing , in the generating functional for the vertex functions @xmath24 , the bare propagator @xmath29 by a modified propagator @xmath30 , @xmath31 constructed such that @xmath32 is strongly suppressed for frequencies below @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath25-dependence of the resulting vertex functions @xmath26 is governed by an infinite hierarchy of coupled odes , the _ rg flow equations _",
    ", of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the self - energy and @xmath35 the two particle vertex . at the beginning of the rg flow ,",
    "the vertex functions are initialized to their bare values , @xmath36 while their fully dressed values , corresponding to the full theory , are recovered upon integrating eqs .",
    "( [ eq : general - flow - equations ] ) from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "the infinite hierarchy of odes ( [ eq : general - flow - equations ] ) is exact , but in most cases not solvable . in the generic , third - order - truncated frg",
    "all @xmath23-particle vertex functions with @xmath37 are neglected @xmath38 and the resulting flow equations for @xmath39 and @xmath40 are integrated numerically . due to this truncation , frg is in essence an `` rg - enhanced '' perturbation expansion in the interaction , that will break down if @xmath41 becomes too large .",
    "in fact , the flow equations can be derived by a purely diagrammatic procedure , without resorting to a generating functional , as explained in ref .  .",
    "the diagrammatic structure is such that the flow of the self - energy and three different parquet channels ( i.e.  three coupled rpa - like series of diagrams ) are treated simultaneously , feeding into each other during the flow ( as discussed in more detail below ) .",
    "this moderates competing instabilities in an unbiased way .",
    "we also mention that this approach has been found to be particularly useful to treat models where infrared divergences play a role@xcite ( though the latter do not arise for the present model ) .",
    "the following statements in this chapter hold for most , however not for every flow parameter .",
    "for that reason we explicitly define the @xmath25-dependence at this point .",

    "the natural choice , as will become apparent later on , is to parametrize it in terms of three bosonic frequencies :    @xmath67    note that due to their definition in terms of purely imaginary frequencies , the bosonic frequencies are imaginary too .",
    "conversely , the fermionic frequencies can be expressed in terms of the bosonic ones :    @xmath68      for the purpose of treating the inhomogeneous model of equation , we take the quantum number that labels green s functions and vertices to denote a composite index of site , spin and matsubara frequency , @xmath69 , etc . since the bare propagators are non - diagonal in the site - index , the number of independent variables @xmath70 generated by eq .",

    "the simplest way to avoid this complication is to neglect the flow of the two - particle vertex : @xmath72 this scheme , to be called frg1 , yields a frequency - independent self - energy , which , for the case of local interaction , is site diagonal .",

    "[ figmodprop](a ) ] the ldos is enhanced [ dark region in fig .",

    "+      having discussed the properties of the noninteracting model , we continue with the frg - results at finite interaction . for this",
    "we first define the spatial dependence of the interaction @xmath22 , which , for the one - dimensional model is an effective one - dimensional interaction resulting from integrating out two space dimensions .",
    "its strength depends on the geometry , and is larger if the spatial confinement perpendicular to the one - dimensional system is smaller .",
    "we assume that this confinement is independent of the position in the transport direction in the center of the qpc , with @xmath203 .",
    "this is a fair assumption for a saddle point approximation of the two - dimensional qpc potential . for @xmath204 ,",
    "@xmath22 drops smoothly to zero , describing the adiabatic coupling to the two - dimensional electron system , represented by the semi - infinite tight binding chain .    in ref .",
    "we showed that the 0.7-anomaly is caused by the van hove ridge in the ldos discussed above .",
    "its apex crosses the chemical potential when the qpc is tuned into the sub - open regime , i.e. the regime where the conductance takes values @xmath205 .",
    "this high ldos at the chemical potential enhances effect of interactions by two main mechanisms : first , the effective hartree barrier depends nonlinearly on gate - voltage and magnetic field , causing an enhanced elastic backscattering ; and second , due to the high ldos inelastic backscattering is enhanced once a phase space is opened up by a finite temperature or source - drain voltage .",
    "both effects reduce the conductance in the sub - open regime , causing the 0.7-anomaly . since interactions are enhanced by the ldos , the relevant dimensionless interaction strength is @xmath206 , which scales like @xmath207 in the sub - open regime .",
    "in this paper we will concentrate on examining how the reliability of the method depends on the interaction , without explaining the physical mechanism underlying the 0.7-anomaly in detail ( for the latter we refer to ref .  ) . for the model eq .",
    "no reliable results are availible from other methods to which we could have compared our own .",
    "instead , we here compare the results of the different frg - schemes frg1 , sfrg2 and dfrg2 .",
    "these schemes differ in the prefactor of the perturbative expansion of terms in order @xmath208 and higher .",
    "if these terms are important the three approximation schemes will deviate from each other .",
    "hence , the qualitative and quantitative reliability can be deduced from the qualitative and quantitative deviations between these schemes .",
    "the first observable we discuss is the linear response conductance at zero teperature@xcite : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the density of states at the boundary of a semi - infinite tight - binding chain , representing the two - dimensional leads ( for a derivation of the boundary green s function , see appendix sec .",
    "[ secprojection ] ) .    particularly interesting in studying the 0.7-anomaly in qpcs",
    "is the shape of the conductance trace as a function of applied gate voltage in the region where its value ( in units of @xmath211 ) changes from zero to one , and how this shape changes with external parameters , such as applied magnetic field .",
    "first of all , we emphasize the good qualitative agreement of all three approximation schemes with each other as well as with experimental results , compare figs .",
    "[ figfrg1vsdfrg ] ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) with ref .",
    "( a direct comparison of dfrg2 with experiment is given in ref .  ) .",
    "this confirms that the method qualitatively captures the physical mechanism with respect to the conductance at zero temperature very well .    for a more quantitative analysis",
    "we first consider the position of the conductance step , say @xmath212 ; even though the actual position of the step is of minor interest experimentally , it gives information about how accurate hartree - type correlations are treated .",
    "[ figfrg1vsdfrg ] ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show the conductance at @xmath213 for increasing values of interaction @xmath41 for frg1 , dfrg2 , and sfrg2 respectively .",
    "while for dfrg2 and for sfrg2 @xmath212 decreases with interaction , its behavior for frg1 is non - monotonic : @xmath212 decreases slightly at small values of interaction , and increases strongly at larger values of interaction .",
    "hence the conductance at large interaction is higher than the bare , @xmath214 , value .",
    "this behavior is unphysical : whenever the density is nonzero , an increase in @xmath41 should cause an increase in the effective barrier height due to coulomb repulsion , and hence a decrease in the conductance .",
    "this artifact is significantly reduced by the vertex - flow of both dfrg2 and sfrg2 . for the latter ,",
    "interactions suppress the conductance more strongly than for the former . due to these deviations between the three schemes",
    ", we can not make a quantitative statement about the exact position of the conductance step @xmath212 .",
    "the deviations just discussed make quantitative comparisons between these methods ( or with others , such as rpa ) difficult if interactions are large .",
    "the reason for the difficulty is that the @xmath215-position of the conductance step depends sensitively on the precise way in which hartree - type correlations are treated and hence differ for each of the above schemes .",
    "hence it would not be meaningful to compare their predictions for physical quantities calculated _ at a given value _",
    "of @xmath181 ; instead , it is only meaningful to compare the shape of their evolution with @xmath181 .",
    "actually , the same is true for physical quantities that are dominated by fock - type correlations , since internal propagators have to be dressed by hartree diagrams . doing this is crucial for inhomogeneous systems such as ours , since an inhomogeneous density causes these hartree contributions to have a significant dependence on position and gate voltage . in the frg approach the feedback of the self - energy eq .",
    "always guarantees that internal lines are dressed in a self - consistent way .",
    "let us now compare the shapes of the @xmath215-dependent conductance curves for dfrg2 and sfrg2 . to this end , replotted the dfrg2 data from fig .",
    "[ figfrg1vsdfrg ] ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ figfrg1vsdfrg ] ( c ) , with a @xmath41-dependent shift @xmath216 in @xmath181-direction ( red lines ) .",
    "it can be seen from comparison with sfrg2 data , that the shapes of the conductance curves are almost identical .",
    "next we analyze the shape of the conductance step at finite interaction , and how it develops with magnetic field .",
    "the effect of an increasing magnetic field is qualitatively similar for the three approximation schemes [ see figs .",
    "[ figfrg1vsdfrg ] ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) ] : the conductance step develops into a spin resolved double step , in an asymmetric way : while the curves hardly change for @xmath215 values where @xmath217 , they are strongly suppressed in the sub - open regime , where the ldos is large . for frg1 the @xmath215-range where the lowest magnetic field , @xmath218 , significantly reduces the conductance w.r.t .",
    "the conductance at @xmath219 , is larger than for dfrg2 and sfrg2 .",
    "this is related to the fact , that the magnetoconductance , the change of conductance with magnetic field , within frg1 is negative even for @xmath215 values where conductance is close to zero [ this effect is too small to be visible in fig .",
    "[ figfrg1vsdfrg ] ( d ) ] .",
    "since this is not the case for dfrg2 and sfrg2 it is not possible to make a reliable statement about the sign of the magnetoconductance in the tunnel regime .",
    "again we reproduced the dfrg2 data from fig .",
    "[ figfrg1vsdfrg ] ( e ) in fig .",
    "[ figfrg1vsdfrg ] ( f ) with a shift @xmath216 in @xmath215 ( red line ) in order to compare their shape with the sfrg2 data ( black dashed line ) .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the conductance within sfrg is slightly larger for small fields and slightly smaller for large fields , than for the dfrg2 results .",
    "based on the facts , that , first , the deviations between dfrg2 and sfrg2 are small and , second , sfrg2 is computationally much cheaper than dfrg2 , we conclude that for preliminary studies , or when scanning a large parameter space , one should favor sfrg2 whenever it is sufficient to know the static part of vertex functions .      as explained in reference  , the 0.7-anomaly",
    "is related to an enhanced spin susceptibility in the sub - open regime of the qpc .",
    "for this quantity an estimate of the error is available within the dfrg2 approximation scheme .",
    "we note that the spin - susceptibility defined in equation   can be calculated in two ways : by numerical differentiation of the magnetization for a small magnetic field , @xmath220 , or via equation  , @xmath221 . like the conductance",
    ", the value of @xmath222 is not known exactly .",
    "thus we argue here as in the previous section .",
    "@xmath220 and @xmath221 are both exact to second order in the interaction , as can easily be checked , but they differ in terms that are of order @xmath223 and higher . if the difference of @xmath220 and @xmath221 is significant , the higher order terms are non - negligible , and the results can not be trusted .",
    "in reference   we showed that @xmath224 is enhanced due to the inhomogeneity of the qpc potential and in addition amplified by interactions .",
    "it has a strong @xmath215-dependence , and is maximal when the qpc is tuned into the sub - open regime . in this regime , at @xmath225 , we compare @xmath220 ( fig .  [ figsus ] black lines ) with @xmath221 ( fig .",
    "[ figsus ] red lines ) for different values of interaction . for intermediate values of interaction @xmath226",
    "both results are essentially identical , while for a larger value of interaction @xmath227 deviations are clearly visible , however still not too large .",
    "the qualitative features that the susceptibility strongly increases with interaction , and that it is enhanced in the center of the qpc , emphasized in ref .  , are confirmed by both results .",
    "furthermore they coincide in their spatial structure , i.e. two maxima in the center and a decaying oscillating behavior .",
    "this spatial structure is mainly given by the ldos at the chemical potential ( see sec .",
    "[ secresutsmodel ] ) and enhanced by interactions .    for a better quantification",
    "we define the relative error : @xmath228 this error is shown on a log - log scale in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figsus ] ( dots ) .",
    "the relative error scales like @xmath223 , since dfrg2 , and thus @xmath220 and @xmath221 are exact to second order in @xmath41 . for the larger value of interaction , @xmath229 , the relative error of about @xmath230",
    "is quite significant and thus the value of @xmath222 is quantitatively not reliable .",
    "the reason for this is that the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath231 is already close to one .",
    "nevertheless the error is still dominated by the third order term , implying that it is controlled .",
    "finally we note that the spin - susceptibility in the rpa approximation @xmath232^{-1 } \\right]_{ij } \\ ; .\\ ] ] diverges at an interaction strength for which frg is still well - behaved .",
    "for example , if bare internal propagators are used to calculate @xmath233 , @xmath234 turns out to diverge at @xmath235 . moreover , the value of @xmath236 and thus also the @xmath41-value for which it diverges depends on how one chooses to treat interactions for internal propagators of @xmath233 .",
    "however rpa itself gives no recipe how to do this .",
    "in contrast , the frg approach gives a systematic framework for computing the two - particle vertex , the self - energy , and their feedback into each other , in a way that moderates competing instabilities in an unbiased way ( as mentioned in section iii ) .",
    "we have derived a frg based approximation scheme , called the coupled - ladder approximation ( cla ) , for spin - full fermionic tight binding models with a local interaction and an arbitrary potential .",
    "the main applications are systems with a significant spatial dependence , in particular , models where the electron density significantly changes with the position in real space .",
    "the cla is formulated within the context of third - order - truncated frg schemes , in which the three particle vertex is set to zero , while the flow of the two particle vertex is fully incorporated .",
    "the cla retains two of the main properties of third - order - truncated frg : it is exact to second order , and sums up diagrams of the rpa in all channels . since the cla is based on a perturbative argument , it is reliable only if interactions are not too large .",
    "we analyzed in detail the reliability of this approach for a one - dimensional tight binding model with a parabolic potential barrier representing a qpc .",
    "for this we compared results for the conductance and the spin susceptibility calculated using different approaches within the frg for different interactions up to @xmath237 .",
    "we identified the magnetic field dependence of the conductance and the enhanced susceptibility related to the 0.7 anomaly,@xcite as robust properties of the model .    finally , let us comment briefly on the prospects of using the cla approach presented here to obtain finite - temperature results .",
    "while the formulas for the local density @xmath23 and the local susceptibility @xmath222 , eq .  , are valid for arbitrary temperature @xmath47 , the conductance formula eq .   holds only for the case of zero temperature .",
    "the generalization of this formula to finite temperature@xcite involves an analytic continuation to the real axis for both self - energy and vertex w.r.t .",
    "their frequency arguments .",
    "however , performing such an analytic continuation for numerical data is a mathematically ill - defined problem and turns out to be especially difficult for matrix - valued functions .",
    "one possibility to avoid this complication is to formulate our cla scheme on the keldysh contour , in which case there are several different possibilities for introducing the frg flow parameter @xcite .",
    "( for a frg treatment of the single impurity anderson model see ref .  ) .",
    "when using keldysh frg to treat equilibrium properties , the number of independent correlators can be reduced by exploiting the kubo - martin - schwinger conditions.@xcite moreover , keldysh frg in principle also allows non - equilibrium properties to be calculated . the actual implementation of keldysh frg for our model will be nontrivial , though , in particular since numerical integrations along the real axis , where green s functions can have poles , can be challenging .",
    "another problem at finite temperature is the violation of particle conservation due to the frg truncation , @xcite .",
    "the extent of this violation might be reduced by by implementing the modified vertex flow suggested by katanin .",
    "@xcite we believe that it would be worth pursuing work in these directions .",
    "we thank sabine andergassen , severin jakobs , volker meden , and herbert schller for very helpful discussions .",

    "nanosystems initiative munich_.",
    "the propagator in the frg flow eqs .",
    "and , in general , lives on an infinite - dimensional chain .",
    "however , since the interacting region has finite extent , we only need to evaluate it on an @xmath1-dimensional subspace .",
    "furthermore , for the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eqchifinal ] ) we need to calculate the sum over all site indices @xmath16 , including the infinite number of sites in the leads . to this end",
    "we perform a standard projection procedure@xcite . with this method",
    "the influence of the leads on the propagator and their contribution to the sum can be calculated analytically if the diagonalization of the leads is known analytically .",
    "therefore we define projection operators @xmath238 and @xmath239 , with @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 which divide the hilbert space into the part that describes the leads , @xmath239 , and the finite dimensional part that describes the central region where interaction is non - zero , @xmath238 .",
    "furthermore , we define for a given quadratic hamiltonian @xmath243 ( for an interacting system @xmath243 is replaced by @xmath244 ) , @xmath245 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath249 and write the hamiltonian in the basis defined by the projections : @xmath250 consequently the greens function in the same basis reads @xmath251 with      in the following we will only use @xmath253 and @xmath254 as well as @xmath255 and @xmath256 expressed in terms @xmath253 and @xmath254 , so we use the shorthands @xmath257 and @xmath258 ( whether @xmath259 lives on the infinite - dimensional hilbert space , or on the subspace of the central contact , will be clear from its site indices ) .",
