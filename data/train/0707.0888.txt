    "[ intro ]    compactifications of string theory give rise to many potential cosmic strings , including the fundamental strings themselves , d - strings and wrapped d - branes , solitonic strings and branes in ten dimensions , and magnetic and electric flux tubes in the four - dimensional effective theory . in various models of inflation in string theory or",
    "grand unified theories a network of such strings will form .",
    "thus it is interesting to ask , what are the prospects for future discovery of these strings if they exist , and , what are the prospects for distinguishing different microscopic models ?    in between the microscopic theories and the observations , the strings have a variety of macroscopic parameters and properties , including :    * their tension , @xmath0 . *",
    "their intercommutation probability @xmath1 .",
    "when two strings collide , they either pass through each other , with probability @xmath2 , or intercommute ( reconnect ) , with probability @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 is a function of the velocity and angle of the collision , but to first approximation one can consider the value averaged over the kinematics . * their gapless degrees of freedom : are these just the collective coordinates for the motion in three - dimensional space , or are there additional bosonic or fermionic modes ? * their interactions with low energy fields : are these gravitational only , or axionic or gauge as well ?",
    "* the number of kinds of string : one or many ? * the existence , or not , of multi - string junctions .",
    "one would hope to proceed from the observation of cosmic strings to a determination of their macroscopic properties , and from there to possible microscopic models .",
    "this requires the ability to calculate with some degree of precision the signatures of a given macroscopic model .",
    "in fact , this is quite challenging .    here",
    "we will focus on the most vanilla type of cosmic string : a single species with @xmath3 , no long - ranged interactions besides gravity , and no multi - string junctions or extra degrees of freedom .",
    "even for these , major uncertainties remain .",
    "1 shows a simulation of the network , with one side of the box being about a quarter of the hubble length .",
    "this simulation is for the radiation era ; the matter era simulations have the same general features but some quantitative differences .",
    "one sees several long strings crossing the simulation volume , and a gas of string loops .",
    "as will be explained in more detail in the next section , the original expectation was that the hubble length ( which is the same order as the horizon length , and the frw time ) would be the only relevant scale in the problem  @xcite .",
    "if this were true , then simulations , beginning with refs .",
    "@xcite , should have readily produced good quantitative descriptions of the networks .",
    "however , inspection of fig .",
    "1 shows that the long strings are not smooth at short distance , but have a kinked structure , which persists down to the cutoff scale of the simulations .",
    "further , it appears that the loops are rather smaller than the hubble scale .",
    "indeed , in the early simulations the loop distribution seemed to peak near the short distance cutoff scale of the simulations .",
    "subsequent work has failed to produce a clear picture , and in fact the estimates of the typical size at which the loops are produced range over more than _ fifty _ orders of magnitude .",
    "this is rather remarkable , when one considers that the entire span from the planck scale to size of the visible universe is just sixty orders of magnitude . moreover ,",
    "the problem is completely well - posed : the limitation is only in our ability to solve the equations .",
    "the problem with the simulations is that they are limited to just a few orders of magnitude in length scale , and even more limited in time scale : for the latter not only is there the direct cost , but the expansion of the universe means that increased time also costs increased simulation volume .",
    "much of the work is based on an expansion factor that is only of order 5 , and it is difficult to distinguish transient effects from real ones .",
    "analytic methods are difficult because of the nonlinearities of the problem .",
    "one can write down the evolution equations for an ensemble of strings  @xcite , but before long one must begin to approximate , and in the end most analytic treatments reduce to somewhat coarse models in terms of a few parameters . on the other hand",
    ", one might have expected that the nature of the problem , the existence of a large ratio of scales , would lend itself to something like a renormalization group treatment .",
    "roughly speaking , one would use the simulations to treat the strongly nonlinear behavior at the hubble scale , and then evolve down to shorter scales analytically .",
    "this was the motivation for the recent work of refs .",
    "thus far , things are not as systematic as for the renormalization group .",
    "the difficulty is evidently that for the string network the flow is not from short distances to long but the other way around .",
    "the hubble length , against which all things are scaled , increases more rapidly than the comoving length ( during the matter and radiation eras ) , so comoving structures move to smaller effective scales over time . in this respect",
    "the problem is like turbulence , and has been similarly frustrating .",
    "nevertheless , it has been possible to proceed by making approximations that are not precisely controlled but perhaps well - motivated .",
    "in particular , this has allowed us to understand why structures appear at scales far below the hubble length .",
    "the simulations are still essential , but the analytic model enables us to distinguish real effects from transient ones , and to extrapolate beyond the scales that can be simulated .",
    "combined with recent simulations that use a trick to get beyond the limitation on expansion times , it may be that a consistent and fairly quantitative picture is emerging .    in sec .  2 we review the basic features of network evolution , defining the problem . in sec",
    "3 we discuss some aspects of the gravitational wave signatures , focussing on the sensitivity to loop size . in sec .  4 we present the analytic model of the short distance structure . in sec .  5",
    "we attempt to compare the model with the simulations , and discuss the current picture .",
    "in this section we review the basics of network evolution , focusing on the issues that will be relevant later . aside from some recent work ,",
    "this is standard material , on which the reader can find more detail in the excellent book by vilenkin and shellard  @xcite .",
    "the relevant processes for vanilla strings are :    1 .   the formation of an initial string network , such that a finite fraction of the string goes into infinite random walks .",
    "2 .   the stretching of the string network with the expansion of the universe .",
    "3 .   the intercommutation of long strings , producing kinks .",
    "4 .   the emission of gravitational radiation from long strings . 5 .   the self - intercommutation of long strings , producing loops , which may fragment further into smaller loops . 6 .",
    "the decay of the loops via emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "we will discuss each of these processes in turn , and then the key issue of the scaling property of the network .      any gauge theory with a broken @xmath4 symmetry has a string soliton solution .",
    "moreover , such strings will actually form in any phase transition in which a @xmath4 symmetry _ becomes _ broken  @xcite . at the transition , the higgs field rolls from the origin to one of the symmetry - breaking vacua , and unless the transition takes place infinitely slowly , causality implies that the phase will uncorrelated over long distances .",
    "thus defects - strings - will form .",
    "causality implies that over long distances the strings form random walks .",
    "a random walk has a finite probability not to return to its starting point , so some of the string will be in infinite random walks ; this conclusion is supported by simulations .",
    "these infinite strings are the seeds of the later network , because any loops that form in the transition will rapidly decay .",
    "subsequently , sarangi and tye  @xcite made the remarkable observation that d - strings would be produced by d - brane annihilation at the end of brane inflation , since the low energy dynamics is again described by @xmath4 symmetry breaking .",
    "in fact , regardless of the microscopic structure of the strings , there is be some dual version of the kibble process , such that if the strings can exist only after some phase transition , they will actually form during that transition .",
    "we must assume that the processes of breakage and string confinement  @xcite are either absent or sufficiently suppressed so as to be negligible on cosmological time scales .",
    "cosmic strings are long compared to their thickness , and so can be treated as idealized one - dimensional objects . for vanilla strings ,",
    "the relevant action is just the nambu action in the frw metric @xmath5 the equation of motion governing the evolution of a cosmic string is @xmath6 here @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 these equations hold in the transverse gauge , where @xmath9 .",
    "dots and primes refer to derivatives relative to the conformal time @xmath10 and the spatial parameter @xmath11 along the string , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the parameter @xmath7 follows from equation ( [ eom ] ) , @xmath12 the equation of motion implies that on scales long compared to the horizon length , which is of the order of the frw time @xmath13 , the string is frozen in the comoving coordinates @xmath14 , and so just expands with the universe .",
    "when a scale comes inside the horizon , the modes begin to oscillate ; the energy begins to redshift away , and the string straightens .    from the second derivative terms it follows that signals on the string",
    "propagate to the right and left with @xmath15 .",
    "thus the structure on a short piece of string at a given time is a superposition of left- and right - moving segments . in an expanding spacetime",
    "the left- and right - moving waves interact  they are not free as in flat spacetime . in terms of left- and right - moving unit vectors",
    "@xmath16 , the equation of motion  ( [ eom ] ) can be written as @xmath17 , \\label{eom2}\\ ] ] so that in the limit that we can ignore the time derivative of the scale factor we recover independent left- and right - moving waves .",
    "when two straight strings intercommute , the resulting strings have a kink , which separates into left- and right - moving kinks . under the flat spacetime nambu equations ,",
    "the kinks would move indefinitely in the two directions .",
    "the curved spacetime equations imply that the kinks persist but their angle slowly decreases  @xcite .",
    "the decrease is sufficiently slow that the kinkiness is potentially very large : if one considers the total root - mean - square kink angle in a length of long string ( which is what would be relevant if the kink directions were uncorrelated ) , one finds that it diverges , so there is the potential for having structure on very small scales in the network .",
    "the oscillations of the long string will emit gravitational radiation , and so are damped below a certain length scale .",
    "a naive estimate would lead to the same scale that we will find below for the loop decays , something of order the dimensionless string tension @xmath18 times the frw time @xmath13 .",
    "however , things are more subtle for long strings .",
    "emission of gravitational radiation requires that a right- and left - moving mode meet . there is a nonlinear suppression when these have very different wavelengths , because the short - wavelength modes essentially perceives a straight string  @xcite , so that the actual damping scale is @xmath19 times a larger power of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "we will be more quantitative about this in secs .  4 and  5 .      when a long string intercommutes with itself , a loop breaks off",
    ". the loop may then self - intercommute and fragment into smaller loops .",
    "this happens rapidly , within one period , so we are interested in the size distribution of the ultimate non - self - intersecting loops .",
    "of course a loop may collide with a long string ( or each other ) and reattach ; for loops close to the frw scale this is likely , but smaller loops have a high probability never to rejoin .",
    "dimensionally , a loop of length @xmath20 emits gravitational radiation power of order @xmath21 .",
    "since its total energy is of order @xmath22 , we conclude that the lifetime is @xmath23 where the numerical factor @xmath24 is found to be of order 50 for typical loops .",
    "in other words , loops smaller than @xmath25 will decay in a hubble time .",
    "now let us put the preceding ingredients together .",
    "a key concept is _ scaling , _ the idea that the statistical properties of the network should be constant when measured in units of the frw time @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "for example , the mean separation between long strings should grow as @xmath13 .",
    "if the network simply expanded with the universe , this separation would grow as the scale factor @xmath26 , which increases more slowly than @xmath13 .",
    "scaling requires that the processes discussed above reduce the amount of string , and that they do so as fast as causality allows , since the horizon distance is also linear in @xmath13 . for a network that scales ,",
    "the energy in strings in a box of side @xmath13 is linear in @xmath13 , so the density is proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "thus it is a fixed multiple of the dominant energy in each epoch , which also is proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "if the energy density did not scale , the strings would eventually come to dominate , unless the string tension were very low .",
    "in fact , it appears that string networks scale under rather general conditions , so that the scaling solution is an attractor .",
    "if the string density exceeds the attractor value , the rate of long - string collisions increases , resulting in more kinks and more loop formation ; if it is smaller , than the opposite occurs .",
    "a simple _ one - scale model _ captures this behavior  @xcite .",
    "suppose that there is a single length scale @xmath29 that governs the network , that is , the long - string separation , the correlation of structure along the long string , and the formation of loops .",
    "a convenient definition is in terms of the energy density in long strings , @xmath30 .",
    "the energy of long strings in a comoving volume would then satisfy @xmath31 the first term is from the expansion of the universe : the 1 in parentheses is just the growth of the length with the scale factor , while the @xmath32 is from the redshifting away of energy below the horizon scale .",
    "the latter follows from the definition  ( [ epsilon ] ) , which implies that the total energy in a string is simply @xmath33 , together with the equation of motion  ( [ epsev ] ) .",
    "the second term is from loop formation , with @xmath34 a constant and the scale @xmath29 inserted by dimensional analysis .",
    "the average @xmath35 plays an important role in the properties of the network .",
    "if the universe were not expanding , the virial theorem would imply that @xmath36 .",
    "the expansion of the universe reduces this to around @xmath37 in the radiation era and @xmath38 in the matter era , according to the simulations  @xcite .",
    "inserting @xmath39 , and defining @xmath40 and @xmath41 , one finds that @xmath42 since @xmath35 is less than 0.5 , the first term is less than 1 in both the matter and the radiation eras , and so @xmath43 is driven to a fixed point value @xmath44r)$ ] .",
    "in fact this model is overly crude and has been superseded by more elaborate models with multiple scales and other parameters , but it captures the basic feedback that is operating .",
    "the scaling property means that the initial conditions from the formation of the network , in particular the initial density of strings , are washed out in time .",
    "thus there are only three processes that enter : expansion , intercommutation , and gravitational radiation .",
    "however , there are some important questions that remain open : does the scaling property apply only to the gross features of the network , or to all details including the loop distribution ? and",
    ", does gravitational radiation only play the role of removing the loops from the network , or is gravitational smoothing of long strings important as well ?",
    "note that if long - string gravitational radiation can be ignored , then the problem has no parameters : the processes of expansion , intercommutation , and loop removal are purely geometric ( the string tension @xmath0 scales out of the equations of motion , and @xmath1 has been set to 1 ) .    as we have noted in the introduction , there is still uncertainty about the small scale properties of the network .",
    "for example , the estimates of the characteristic size @xmath45 at which loops form range over    * @xmath46 . a loop size near the hubble scale was the initial expectation in this subject , as embodied in the one - scale model , and in fact this is also the conclusion of some of the most recent simulations  @xcite . * @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "other recent simulations  @xcite point to a loop size that still scales as a pure number times the frw time , but rather smaller than the above .",
    "* @xmath49 .",
    "these loops still scale , but only with the inclusion of gravitational backreaction to smooth the long strings  @xcite . * @xmath50 .",
    "again this length scales , but as noted earlier backreaction is less efficient than originally thought  @xcite . *",
    "@xmath51 string thickness .",
    "this length does not scale , but remains at a fixed physical size  @xcite .",
    "this has been a contentious subject , and indeed in the references a number of names are attached to more than one estimate . in the end this will not be surprising , as we will argue that more than one of these estimates is correct .",
    "since vanilla strings have only gravitational long - range interactions , the key parameter is @xmath18 , which determines the typical metric perturbation produced by a long string . in models of brane inflation , this is related to the scale of cmb fluctuations @xmath52 , but in a way that depends on the geometry so that one obtains as an interesting range  @xcite @xmath53 this is probably also relevant to more general models in which strings are produced at the end of inflation .",
    "possible gravitational signatures include    * dark matter . * effect on cmb and galaxy formation . * gravitational lensing . * gravitational radiation .",
    "we can immediately eliminate this .",
    "we have noted that the string density is a fixed fraction of the dominant energy density in a scaling regime .",
    "the ratio is proportional to the string tension , in the dimensionless combination @xmath18 ; the simulations give approximately @xmath54 in the matter era and @xmath55 in the radiation era . since the current upper bound on @xmath18 is around @xmath56 , this is rather less than one . of course , if the network does not scale and if the string tension is just right , then the strings could become dominant at some late time  but then they would not redshift like matter . the effective value of the equation of state parameter would be between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , so they are also not the dark energy .",
    "the cmb perturbations come primarily from the long strings , since their fields extend coherently over long distances .",
    "thus they depend on network properties that are reasonably well understood .",
    "the scaling property implies that this perturbation spectrum is scale invariant , but the power spectrum does not match observations : there are no acoustic peaks , because the perturbations are generated after the modes reenter the horizon rather than ( as with inflation ) before they leave .",
    "this translates into an upper bound  @xcite @xmath59 .",
    "bounds from non - gaussianities are currently less sensitive than those from the power spectrum .",
    "the strongest bound , around @xmath60 comes not from limits on string - like features , but from limits on doppler deviations from a black body spectrum that would be introduced by the transverse motion of the strings  @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum bound is argued to be approaching the cosmic variance limit , but bounds from polarization  @xcite or pattern search will improve one or two orders of magnitude with time .",
    "if the loops are large enough , they can act as seeds for early galaxy formation and so lead to early reioniziation  @xcite .",
    "if the largest estimates of loop size are correct , this leads to a stronger bound @xmath61 , with some uncertainties .      both long strings and loops",
    "( if they are large enough ) can lens more distant objects .",
    "the deficit angle at a string is @xmath62 , or around @xmath63 arc - second at the current cmb bound .",
    "the separation for a given object will be somewhat larger or smaller than this , depending on the geometry and the string velocity  @xcite .",
    "occasional lens candidates have been reported , but have thus far always proven to be binary galaxies . to obtain bounds from lensing",
    "requires a large survey , because a string network lenses only a small fraction of the sky .",
    "optical surveys may reach @xmath64  @xcite , and radio frequency surveys may eventually be sensitive down to @xmath65  @xcite .    for lensing , there is the issue of how straight the string is at short distances .",
    "most phenomenology has considered two extremes : a straight string , which simply translates a strip of the background and so produces identical double images , or a random walk , which produces complex multiple images .",
    "further , with the straight string any additional lensed objects would be on a line through the lens axis ; with the random walk they will be distributed more irregularly .",
    "it will be one of our results to resolve this for the real networks .",
    "this seems the most likely route by which cosmic strings will be discovered , or the bounds tightened to an interesting degree .",
    "again , we refer the reader to vilenkin and shellard  @xcite for a detailed treatment , as well as ref .",
    "@xcite , and also refs .",
    "@xcite for recent updates .",
    "in contrast to the signatures above , the gravitational radiation comes predominantly from the loops , because these are smaller and so have higher frequencies .",
    "thus the issue of loop size is particularly important .    for vanilla strings ,",
    "all of the energy going into loops ends up as gravitational radiation .",
    "we can get the total energy going into loops from energy conservation . as in sec .",

    "smaller loops decay essentially at once on the cosmological time scale , so this energy goes directly into gravitational waves .",
    "loops that form at larger sizes persist for a while before decaying .",
    "we consider the latter case first .      once a loop forms ( below the hubble scale )",
    ", it stops redshifting , so the energy density in loops behaves like matter . during the matter era , this is not so interesting , but during the radiation era it implies that the energy density in a set of string loops grows relative to the dominant energy @xmath71 .",
    "a large loop that forms at size @xmath72 will decay at @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",

    "however , as the loops begin to decay via gravitational radiation , these curves smooth , because the higher harmonics decay faster than the lower . thus the large loops will develop cusps as they decay .",
    "however , a factor of 10 is lost to the small loops ( since large loops decaying today formed during the radiation era ) so these are unlikely to be seen at ligo except in very favorable parts of parameter space ( such as small @xmath1 ) .",

    "the effect of @xmath238 is to increase by a factor @xmath239 the event rate for @xmath18 greater than @xmath92 , and decrease it by a factor @xmath240 below this tension  @xcite .",
    "however , the relativistic loop velocities lead to two additional effects .",
    "first , the number of cusp events is controlled by @xmath241 , which is smaller by a factor of order 50 ; the rate is increased by this factor .",
    "second , the observed periodicity of a loop is set by @xmath242 : for @xmath243 the periodicity is one year , but for @xmath244 it drops to two weeks .",
    "a one - year run will therefore see 25 cusps if it sees one , and so the mean event rate is not a good measure of the likelihood of seeing at least one event .",

    "@xcite suggests that these small - loop cusps are within reach of advanced ligo only for tensions very close to the current upper limit , but again it is clear that a more precise understanding of the networks is essential .",
    "thus , of the four cases ( large loops versus small and low harmonics versus high ) , the low harmonic stochastic radiation from large loops seems to be the most promising signature , with sensitivity to @xmath18 improving by several orders of magnitude in the next decade , both in pulsar observations and at advanced ligo .",
    "assuming a vanilla string network , observation of the stochastic radiation would determine the string tension via  ( [ stoch ] ) , _ assuming _ that the large loop size and velocity distribution is accurately known , in particular the mean values of @xmath245 and the fraction of string going into long loops .    in the approximation used in sec .  3.4.1",

    "the slope of the spectrum ( and , ideally , the observation of the stochastic radiation in both the pulsar band and the ligo band ) give some check on the cosmic string interpretation .",
    "it is interesting to go beyond the vanilla model and allow for a general value of @xmath1 .",
    "the simplest argument would predict that the signals scale as @xmath249 , because one would need to increase the long string density by this factor in order to get the same intercommutation rate .",
    "however , inserting a factor of @xmath1 into the loop production in the one - scale model  ( [ 1sm ] ) one finds that the model predicts that the density scales as @xmath250 .",
    "this is because one needs to _ increase _ the rate of long string intercommutations , to produces more kinks , so that the loop production ( which only comes from self - intersections ) stays at the @xmath3 value . on the other hand , simulations  @xcite",
    "show a dependence more like @xmath251 : evidently , the reduction of @xmath1 is partly offset by multiple crossings of the colliding strings .",
    "there is some degeneracy in the determination of @xmath18 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that the low frequency stochastic radiation  ( [ stoch ] ) and the high frequency stochastic radiation  ( [ hstoch ] ) depend on @xmath18 approximately as @xmath252 , and so on @xmath18 and @xmath1 only through @xmath253 .",
    "thus , measurement of the overall normalization of the stochastic radiation does not break the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath18 even if both the low harmonic and high harmonic contributions are seen ( unless @xmath247 , as discussed above ) .",
    "ultimately , lisa will be sensitive to low - harmonic gravitational radiation from large loops , and individual cusps from large and small loops , over the most or all of the range of tensions that arise in brane inflation .",
