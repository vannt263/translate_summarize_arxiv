    "it improves the above theorem [ bminvol ] since we now require a lower bound on the ricci curvature instead of a pinching of the sectional curvature ; moreover , under the hypothesis , we prove that if the volume of @xmath13 is close to the volume of @xmath14 then these two manifolds are diffeomorphic .",
    "more precisely ,    [ main - theorem ] given any integer @xmath19 and @xmath25 , there exists @xmath26 such that the following holds .",
    "suppose that @xmath8 is an @xmath2-dimensional closed hyperbolic manifold with diameter @xmath27 and that @xmath13 is a closed manifold which dominates @xmath14 .",

    "the authors prove the existence of closed n - dimensional manifolds @xmath13 which are homeomorphic to a closed n - dimensional hyperbolic manifold @xmath1 but not diffeomorphic to it .",
    "an immediate corollary of the above theorem is the following .    with the above notations ,",
    "there exists @xmath30 depending on @xmath2 and on the diameter of @xmath14 with the property that for any such @xmath13 and any riemannian metric @xmath10 on @xmath13 whose ricci curvature is bounded below by @xmath31 one has , @xmath32    to be more precise in @xcite the manifold @xmath13 is obtained as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an exotic sphere .",
    "not every closed hyperbolic manifold @xmath14 gives rise to such a @xmath13 that is ( obviously ) homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , we may have to take a finite cover of @xmath14 .",
    "but when we get one construction that works , it does on any finite cover @xmath35 of @xmath14 as well .",
    "the authors also prove that by taking covers of arbitrary large degree we can put on @xmath13 a metric whose sectional curvature is arbitrarily pinched around , say @xmath36 .",
    "the stronger the pinching , the larger the degree . now assume that @xmath37 could be taken independent of the diameter of @xmath14 ; applying the results of @xcite one could show that the volumes of the two manifold are very close when the pinching on @xmath13 is very sharp ( close to @xmath36 ) .",
    "the volume of @xmath13 endowed with this pinched metric could then be taken smaller than @xmath38 , by choosing a covering of large degree ; the manifolds though are not diffeomorphic .",
    "this gives a contradiction and shows that `` size '' of @xmath14 has to be involved in the statement of the theorem , for example its diameter .",
    "we argue by contradiction .",
    "suppose that there is a sequence @xmath39 of closed hyperbolic manifolds with diameter @xmath27 and a sequence of closed manifolds @xmath40 , of degree one continuous maps @xmath41 and metrics @xmath42 on @xmath40 satisfying the hypothesis ( [ e0.1 ] ) and ( [ e0.2 ] ) for some @xmath43 going to zero .",
    "since @xmath44 is of degree one and @xmath45 is hyperbolic , it is equivalent to say ( thanks to mostow s rigidity theorem ) that @xmath44 is homotopic to a diffeomorphism or simply that @xmath45 and @xmath40 are diffeomorphic .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath40 and @xmath45 are not diffeomorphic .",
    "one then shows that up to a subsequence , for large @xmath46 , @xmath40 is diffeomorphic to a closed manifold @xmath13 , @xmath45 is diffeomorphic to a closed manifold @xmath14 , and @xmath14 and @xmath13 are diffeomorphic .",
    "one argues as follows : by the classical finiteness results we get the sub - convergence of the sequence @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , the curvature is @xmath36 , the diameter is bounded by hypothesis , and there is a universal lower bound for the volume of any closed hyperbolic manifold of a given dimension , thanks to margulis lemma ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finiteness theorem then applies .",
    "moreover , on a closed manifold of dimension @xmath48 , there is at most one hyperbolic metric , up to isometry .",
    "we can therefore suppose that @xmath49 is a fixed hyperbolic manifold .",
    "the inequality proved in theorem [ minvol ] provides a lower bound for the volume of @xmath40 as it is explained below .",
    "we have no a priori bounds on the diameter of @xmath50 , but we can use cheeger - colding s theory to obtain sub - convergence in the pointed gromov - hausdorff topology to a complete metric space @xmath51 with small singular set . to obtain more geometric control ,",
    "the idea is to use the natural maps between @xmath40 and @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one can show that they sub - convergence to a limit map between @xmath52 and @xmath14 , which is an isometry .",
    "then @xmath14 is an @xmath2-dimensional smooth closed riemannian manifold which is the gromov - hausdorff limit of the sequence @xmath50 of riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath2 satisfying the lower bound ( [ e0.1 ] ) on ricci curvature , therefore @xmath14 and @xmath40 are diffeomorphic for large @xmath46 by a theorem of j. cheeger and t. colding .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the construction and the properties of the natural maps are given in section 2 . in section 3 , we construct the limit space @xmath52 and the limit map @xmath53 . in section 4 , we prove that @xmath54 is an isometry and conclude .      for two closed manifolds @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 we said above that @xmath13 dominates @xmath14 if there exists a map of degree one from @xmath13 onto @xmath14 .",
    "we could have required that there exists a map @xmath55 of non - zero degree .",
    "the main theorem of @xcite was stated and proved in this set up .",
    "more precisely , the following statement holds    @xcite let @xmath8 be an @xmath2-dimensional closed hyperbolic manifold and @xmath13 a closed manifold such that there exists a map @xmath56 with non - zero degree denoted deg(f ) .",
    "then , for any metric @xmath10 on @xmath13 such that @xmath20 , one has @xmath57 , and equality happens if and only if @xmath29 is homotopic to a riemannian covering ( _ i.e. _ locally isometric ) of degree |deg(f)| from @xmath16 onto @xmath8 .    with the technique developed in this article , the following result can be proved    [ degree ] given any integer @xmath19 and @xmath25 , there exists @xmath26 such that the following holds .",

    "the proof is essentially the one described above ; it uses the technique described below and the treatment of an arbitrary degree given in @xcite . the fact that the degree can be , in absolute value , greater than one yields extra technicalities . for the sake of clarity",
    "we shall omit this proof in the present article and leave it to the reader .",
    "a corollary is ,    let @xmath1 be a closed @xmath2-dimensional hyperbolic manifold , then there exists @xmath30 , such that , for any metric @xmath10 on the connected sum @xmath60 satisfying that its ricci curvature of @xmath10 is not smaller than @xmath31 , @xmath61    we may now ask whether such a result could be true with a lower bound on the scalar curvature instead of a lower bound on the ricci curvature .",
    "the situation in dimension @xmath62 , completely clarified by perelman s work , shows that the answer to this question is negative .",
