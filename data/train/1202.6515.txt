    "genetical genomics experiments have now been routinely conducted to measure both the genetic variants and the gene expression data on the same subjects .",
    "such data have provided important insights into gene expression regulations in both model organisms and humans [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "gene expression levels are treated as quantitative traits and are subject to standard genetic analysis in order to identify the gene expression quantitative loci ( eqtl ) . however , the genetic architecture for many gene expressions may be complex due to possible multiple genetic effects and gene  gene interactions , and poorly estimated genetic architecture may compromise the inferences of the dependency structures of genes at the transcriptional level [ @xcite ] . for a given gene , typical analysis of such eqtl data",
    "is to identify the genetic loci or single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) that are linked or associated with the expression level of this gene .",
    "depending on the locations of the eqtls or the snps , they are often classified as distal _",
    "trans_-linked loci or proximal _ cis_-linked loci [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "although such a single gene analysis can be effective in identifying the associated genetic variants , gene expressions of many genes are in fact highly correlated due to either shared genetic variants or other unmeasured common regulators .",
    "one important biological problem is to study the conditional independence among these genes at the expression level .",
    "eqtl data provide important information about gene regulation and have been employed to infer regulatory relationships among genes [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "gene expression data have been used for inferring the genetic regulatory networks , for example , in the framework of gaussian graphical models ( _ ggm _ ) [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "graphical models use graphs to represent dependencies among stochastic variables .",
    "in particular , the _ ggm _ assumes that the multivariate vector follows a multivariate normal distribution with a  particular structure of the inverse of the covariance matrix , called the concentration matrix . for such gaussian graphical models",
    ", it is usually assumed that the patterns of variation in expression for a given gene can be predicted by those of a small subset of other genes .",
    "this assumption leads to sparsity ( i.e. , many zeros ) in the concentration matrix and reduces the problem to well - known neighborhood selection or covariance selection problems [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "in such a concentration graph modeling framework , the key idea is to use partial correlation as a  measure of the independence of any two genes , rendering it straightforward to distinguish direct from indirect interactions . due to high - dimensionality of the problem",
    ", regularization methods have been developed to estimate the sparse concentration matrix where a sparsity penalty function such as the  @xmath0 penalty or scad penalty is often used on the concentration matrix [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] . among these methods ,",
    "the coordinate descent algorithm of @xcite , named _ glasso _ , provides a computationally efficient method for performing the lasso - regularized estimation of the sparse concentration matrix .",
    "although the standard _ _ ggm__s can be used to infer the conditional dependency structures using gene expression data alone from eqtl experiments , such models ignore the effects of genetic variants on the means of the expressions , which can compromise the estimate of the concentration matrix , leading to both false positive and false negative identifications of the edges of the gaussian graphs .",
    "for example , if two genes are both regulated by the same genetic variants , at the gene expression level , there should not be any dependency of these two genes .",
    "however , without adjusting for the genetic effects on gene expressions , a link between these two genes is likely to be inferred . for eqtl data",
    ", we are interested in identifying the conditional dependency among a set of genes after removing the effects from shared regulations by the markers . such a graph can truly reflect gene regulation at the expression level .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a sparse conditional gaussian graphical model ( _ cggm _ ) that simultaneously identifies the genetic variants associated with gene expressions and constructs a sparse gaussian graphical model based on eqtl data .",
    "different from the standard _",
    "_ ggm__s that assume constant means , the _ cggm _ allows the means to depend on covariates or genetic markers .",
    "we consider a set of regressions of gene expression in which both regression coefficients and the error concentration matrix have many zeros .",
    "zeros in regression coefficients arise when each gene expression only depends on a very small set of genetic markers ; zeros in the concentration matrix arise since the gene regulatory network and therefore the corresponding concentration matrix is sparse .",
    "this approach is similar in spirit to the seemingly unrelated regression ( sur ) model of @xcite in order to improve the estimation efficiency of the effects of genetic variants on gene expression by considering the residual correlations of the gene expression of many genes . in the analysis of eqtl data",
    ", we expect sparseness in both the regression coefficients and also the concentration matrix .",
    "we propose to develop a regularized estimation procedure to simultaneously select the snps associated with gene expression levels and to estimate the sparse concentration matrix .",
    "different from the original sur model of @xcite that focuses on improving the estimation efficiency of the regression coefficients , we focus more on estimating the sparse concentration matrix adjusting for the effects of the snps on mean expression levels .",
    "we develop an efficient coordinate descent algorithm to obtain the penalized estimates and present the asymptotic results to justify our estimates .    in the next sections we first present the formulation of the _ cggm _ for both the mean gene expression levels and the concentration matrix .",
    "we then present an efficient coordinate descent algorithm to perform the regularized estimation of the regression coefficients and concentration matrix .",
    "simulation experiments and asymptotic theory are used to justify our proposed methods .",
    "we apply the methods to an analysis of a yeast eqtl data set .",
    "we conclude the paper with a brief discussion .",

    "we use @xmath57 .",
    "we present an algorithm for the optimization problem ( [ objadap ] ) with lasso penalty function for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "a similar algorithm can be developed for the adaptive lasso penalty with simple modifications . under this penalty function ,",
    "the objective function is then @xmath58 the subgradient equation for maximization of the log - likelihood ( [ loglik ] ) with respect to @xmath27 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath11 is known , @xcite and @xcite have cast the optimization problem ( [ loglik ] ) as a block - wise coordinate descent algorithm , which can be formulated as @xmath6 iterative lasso problems . before we proceed , we first introduce some notation to better represent the algorithm .",

    "we partition @xmath61 and @xmath62 as @xmath63 @xcite show that the solution for @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 which by convex duality is equivalent to solving the dual problem @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "then the solution for @xmath64 can be obtained via the solution of the lasso problem and through the relation @xmath68 .",
    "the estimate for @xmath27 can also be updated in this block - wise manner very efficiently through the relationship @xmath69 [ @xcite ] .",
    "after we finish an updating cycle for @xmath27 , we can proceed to update the estimate of @xmath11 .",
    "since the object function of our penalized log - likelihood is quadratic in @xmath11 given @xmath27 , we can use a direct coordinate descent algorithm to get the penalized estimate of @xmath11 . for",

    "note that when @xmath86 , this algorithm simply reduces to the _ glasso _ or the adaptive _ glasso _ ( _ aglasso _ ) algorithm of @xcite . a similar algorithm was used in @xcite for sparse multivariate regressions .",
    "proposition 2 in the supplementary material [ @xcite ] proves that the above iterative algorithm for minimizing @xmath97 with respective to @xmath11 and @xmath27 converges to a stationary point of @xmath97 .",
    "while the iterative algorithm reaches a stationary point of @xmath97 , it is not guaranteed to reach the global minimum .",

    "there are potentially many stationary points due to the high - dimensional nature of the parameter space .",

    "since we focus on estimating the sparse precision matrix and the sparse regression coefficients , we use the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) to choose these two parameters .",
    "the bic is defined as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the dimension of @xmath4 , @xmath102 is the number of nonzero off - diagonal elements of @xmath90 and @xmath103 is the number of nonzero elements of @xmath94 .",

    "sections 4 and 5 in the supplementary material [ @xcite ] state and prove theoretical properties of the proposed penalized estimates of the sparse _ cggm _ : its asymptotic distribution , the oracle properties when @xmath6 and @xmath9 are fixed as @xmath104 and the convergence rates and sparsistency of the estimators when @xmath105 and @xmath106 diverge as @xmath104 . by sparsistency , we mean the property that all parameters that are zero are actually estimated as zero with probability tending to one [ @xcite ] .",
    "we observe that the asymptotic bias for @xmath90 is at the same rate as @xcite for sparse _",

    "we have presented a sparse conditional gaussian graphical model for estimating the sparse gene expression network based on eqtl data in order to account for genetic effects on gene expressions . since",

    "we used the gaussian graphical models for studying the conditional independence among genes at the transcriptional level .",
    "such undirected graphs do not provide information on causal dependency .",

    "although genetical genomics data can indeed provide opportunity for inferring the causal networks at the transcriptional level , these causal graphical model - based approaches can often only handle a small number of transcripts because the number of possible directed graphs is super - exponential in the number of genes considered [ @xcite ] .",
