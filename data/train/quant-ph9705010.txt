    "gamow vectors in rigged hilbert spaces ( rhs ) were introduced  @xcite to describe resonances , since they possess all the features usually attributed to resonance states , in particular , they obey an exponential decay law and have a breit - wigner energy distribution .",
    "they can be constructed from the first order poles of the analytically continued s - matrix on the second riemann sheet of the complex energy plane , and are generalized eigenvectors of a self - adjoint hamiltonian with complex eigenvalues ( energy and lifetime ) . considering the s - matrix poles on the second riemann sheet of higher order , e.g. order @xmath0 , one can construct in the same way @xmath0 gamow vectors of orders @xmath1 .",
    "these higher order gamow vectors are jordan vectors of degree @xmath2 ,  @xcite and they span an @xmath0-dimensional subspace of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the space of generalized vectors ( functionals ) of the rigged hilbert space @xmath5 . for the self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath6 one",
    "obtains in the space @xmath4 a matrix representation which , when restricted to the subspace @xmath7 , form a jordan block of degree r.  @xcite    jordan block matrices for the hamiltonian were already investigated by katznelson  @xcite who based his work on the well established ideas of horwitz  @xcite . however , their hamiltonians are non - self - adjoint , and their matrices are a generalization of the standard finite dimensional complex diagonalizable matrices for `` effective '' non - hermitian hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "this approach can not be implemented in a quantum theoretical framework using the hilbert space .",
    "in contrast , the gamow - jordan vectors that are derived from higher order s - matrix poles have , like ordinary gamow vectors representing breit - wigner resonances , a natural place in the rigged hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics .    in section  [ sec : resonances ] , we will give a brief introduction to rigged hilbert spaces , ordinary and higher order gamow vectors , and their time evolution .",
    "in section  [ sec : uniqueness ] , we will define the exponentially decaying higher order gamow state operator which was conjectured in reference  @xcite and discuss its generalization .",
    "we argue that these higher order gamow state operators are of this form because ( with certain qualifications ) this is the only way to reconcile them with the exponential law .",
    "conventionally , a resonance is described by a pair of first order poles of an analytically continued s - matrix  @xcite .",
    "these poles lie on the second sheet of the two - sheeted riemann surface of complex energy at the complex conjugate positions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the resonance energy and @xmath11 is the lifetime of the resonance . the pole in the lower half - plane can be associated with a state that decays exponentially ( for @xmath12 ) , while the pole in the upper half - plane can be associated with a state that grows exponentially ( for @xmath13 ) . while in hilbert space there are no such states that have an exponential time evolution and distinguish a direction of time , in the rigged hilbert space ( rhs ) one describes such states by antilinear continuous functionals , the gamow vectors .",
    "the rigged hilbert space consists of a triplet of spaces  @xcite : @xmath14 the best known example is the rhs where @xmath15 is the space ( schwartz space ) of `` well - behaved '' functions , i.e. functions , that have derivatives , which are all continuous , smooth , and rapidly decreasing .",
    "@xmath16 is the space of lebesgue square integrable functions , and @xmath4 ( the space of continous antilinear functionals on @xmath15 ) is the space of tempered distributions .    in quantum theory ,",
    "if one distinguishes between preparations and registrations  @xcite , one can further specify the rhs , and is led to a pair of rhs s : one for the preparations and one for the registrations  @xcite .",
    "a scattering experiment can be subdivided into a preparation stage and a registration stage .",
    "the in - state @xmath17 that evolves from the prepared in - state @xmath18 outside the interaction region is determined by the preparation apparatus ( the accelerator ) .",
    "the out - state @xmath19 , detected as the `` out - state '' @xmath20 outside the interaction region , is determined by the registration apparatus ( detector ) . according to the physical interpretation of the rhs formulation , `` real '' physical entities connected with the experimental apparatuses ,",
    "e.g. the ensemble @xmath21 describing the preparation apparatus ( the energy distribution of the beam ) or the observable @xmath22 describing the registration apparatus ( the energy resolution of the detector ) are described by the `` well - behaved '' vectors @xmath23 .",
    "one denotes the space of state vectors @xmath17 by @xmath24 and the space of `` observable vectors '' @xmath19 by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath24 is the space of `` well - behaved '' hardy class vectors from below and @xmath25 is the space of `` well - behaved '' hardy class vectors from above , i.e. they fulfill even stronger properties connected with their analytic continuation , than the elements of the schwartz space  @xcite .",
    "we will call these elements `` _ very _ well - behaved '' vectors . in place of the single rigged hilbert space we therefore have a pair of rigged hilbert spaces : @xmath28 here the hilbert space @xmath16 is the same for both triplets .    on the level of @xmath15 or @xmath16 one can not talk of single microsystems , and there are no mathematical objects in hilbert space quantum mechanics to describe a single microsystem or a single experiment which prepares and observes a single microsystem .",
    "still , it is intuitively attractive to imagine that the effect by which the preparation apparatus acts on the registration apparatus is carried out by single physical entities , the microphysical systems . the energy distribution for a microphysical system does not have to be a `` well - behaved '' function of the physical values of energy @xmath29 .",
    "hence , for the hypothetical entities connected with microphysical systems , like dirac s `` scattering states '' @xmath30 or gamow s `` decaying states '' @xmath31 , the rhs formulation uses elements of @xmath4 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the decaying gamow vector associated with the complex energy @xmath8 is a continuous antilinear functional over the vectors @xmath34 , and its time evolution is defined for times @xmath35 .",
    "they are generalized eigenvectors of ( the extension of ) a self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath6 with complex eigenvalue @xmath36 @xmath37 ( where the @xmath38 denotes the conjugate operator acting on the functionals ) .",
    "these gamow vectors can be obtained from the first order poles of the analytically continued s - matrix at the position @xmath36 on the lower half - plane of the second riemann sheet , @xmath39 here @xmath40 can determined from the unitarity of the s - matrix to be @xmath41  @xcite . in the same way one can define the exponentially growing gamow vector associated with the complex energy @xmath42 , which is a continuous antilinear functionals over the vectors @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 order gamow vector associated with the complex energy @xmath36 is a generalization of the gamow vector above in the following way :    \\1 ) there are @xmath0 generalized vectors ( functionals ) of order @xmath45 .",
    "they are associated with a pole of the order @xmath0 at the position @xmath36 on the second riemann sheet of the analytically continued s - matrix , @xmath46 where the coefficients @xmath47 can be determined from the unitarity of the s - matrix  @xcite and are complex numbers with dimension [ energy]@xmath48 .",
    "one starts from the s - matrix elements , i.e. the matrix elements of the incoming prepared state @xmath49 at @xmath50 and the outgoing detected observable @xmath51 at @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the mller wave operators .",
    "one can now deform the contour of integration from the cut ( positive real axis and spectrum of @xmath6 ) , into the lower half - plane of the second sheet .",
    "then one obtains a `` background integral '' term , independent of the poles , along the negative real axis of the second sheet and a residue term for the pole : @xmath55 for every residue term of the s - matrix pole at @xmath36 one obtains : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath58-th derivative of the `` well - behaved '' ( continuous , analytic , smooth , rapidly decreasing ) function @xmath59 at the position @xmath36 , and is therefore analytic in the lower half - plane , and @xmath60 is the @xmath61-th derivative of the `` well - behaved '' analytic function @xmath62 at the position @xmath36 in the lower half - plane .",
    "the s - matrix  ( [ s ] ) is thus associated with a set of @xmath0 generalized vectors , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the ordinary gamow vector .",
    "( the same generalization can be carried out for the growing higher order gamow vectors with complex energy @xmath65 which we shall not discuss here . )",
    "\\2 ) it can be shown that the higher order gamow vectors are generalized eigenvectors of the self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath6 in the following sense @xmath66 omitting the arbitrary @xmath19 one writes this as @xmath67 from this it follows that @xmath68 is a jordan operator of degree @xmath0 , and the @xmath61-th order gamow vector @xmath69 is a jordan vector of degree @xmath2  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath70    \\3 ) the time evolution of the decaying @xmath61-th order gamow vector is given by [ 2 ] @xmath71 the @xmath61-th order gamow vector evolves into a superposition containing gamow vectors of the same and all lower orders and the space spanned by the set ( 2.10 ) is thus invariant under the action of the time evolution operator .",
    "it follows from ( 2.14 ) that the time evolution of the dyadic product of a @xmath61-th order gamow vector with an @xmath72-th order gamow vector , @xmath73 , has terms with additional powers of @xmath74 multiplying the overall exponential factor @xmath75 .",
    "such non - exponential time evolution is really no surprise in view of the previous results [ 14 ] .",
    "a more surprising fact is that certain linear combinations of the dyadic products , e.g. , @xmath76 have a purely exponential time evolution [ 7 ] : @xmath77",
    "we now wish to determine to what extent the requirement of exponential time evolution restricts the form of an operator constructed as a linear combination of dyadic products of vectors in @xmath7 .",
    "the most general linear combination of dyadic products of vectors in @xmath7 is given by @xmath78 with arbitrary coefficients @xmath79 .",
    "we will show that @xmath80 decays according to the pure exponential @xmath75 if and only if the coefficients are restricted by @xmath81 where the coefficients @xmath82 remain arbitrary , that is , if and only if @xmath80 is restricted to the form @xmath83 with arbitrary coefficients @xmath84 . since the vectors @xmath85 have the dimension @xmath86^{-{1\\over2}-k}$ ] , the sums over @xmath61 in ( 3.3 ) have the dimensions @xmath87^{-1-n}$ ] so that , if @xmath88 is to be dimensionless , then the coefficients @xmath84 must have the dimensions @xmath86^n$ ] as in ( 2.15 ) .    for the proof it is convenient to consider the most general linear combination of dyadic products @xmath89 for which the sum @xmath90 of the orders does not exceed a finite integer @xmath91 ;",
    "this is given by @xmath92 with arbitrary coefficients @xmath93 .",
    "the operator ( 3.1 ) is obtained as a special case of the operator ( 3.4 ) by setting @xmath94 the time dependence of @xmath95 is given , using ( 2.14 ) , by @xmath96 changing the order of the summations , @xmath97 allows the dyadic products , which are linearly independent operators , to be factored out of the sums over terms in which they appear as common factors : @xmath98    the operator @xmath99 will decay according to the pure exponential @xmath75 if and only if all terms involving additional powers of @xmath74 cancel .",
    "all terms involving additional powers of @xmath74 will cancel if and only if the coefficients @xmath93 satisfy the conditions @xmath100 the simplest of these conditions are those for which @xmath101 , i.e. , those for which @xmath102 , because they are the only conditions that involve sums over only two values of @xmath61 : @xmath103 or , replacing @xmath104 with @xmath105 , @xmath106 or , using the definition @xmath107 , @xmath108 these conditions relate pairs of coefficients @xmath93 having the same values of @xmath109 and successive values of @xmath61 . for fixed @xmath110 , they may be used recursively to show that @xmath93 must equal @xmath111 multiplied by @xmath112 : @xmath113    \\left[{(n\\!-\\!k\\!+\\!2)!(k\\!-\\!2)!\\over ( n\\!-\\!k\\!+\\!1)!(k\\!-\\!1)!}\\right ]    \\cdots    \\left[{(n\\!-\\!1)!1!\\over ( n\\!-\\!2)!2!}\\right ]    \\left[{n!0!\\over ( n\\!-\\!1)!1!}\\right ]    a_{n,0 }    \\\\    & = &    { n!0!\\over ( n\\!-\\!k)!k ! }    a_{n,0 }    =    { n\\choose k }    a_{n,0 }    \\hspace{1cm}\\hbox{for}\\hspace{1 cm }    \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l }      n\\in\\{1,\\cdots , j\\ } , \\\\",

    "the coefficients @xmath111 , for @xmath116 , and also the coefficient @xmath117 , remain completely arbitrary .",
    "we conclude that a linear combination of dyadic products @xmath89 for which the sum @xmath90 of the orders does not exceed @xmath91 decays according to the pure exponential @xmath75 if and only if it is of the form @xmath118 with arbitrary coefficients @xmath111 . equation ( 3.3 ) , i.e. , ( 3.1 ) with the restrictions ( 3.2 ) , follows by applying the special case ( 3.5 ) to the result ( 3.8 ) .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "in the conventional hilbert space quantum mechanics , resonance states can not be described by state vectors .",
    "therefore the most common definition of a resonance is as a pole of the s - matrix at the complex energy @xmath8 ( actually , a pair of poles at @xmath119 ) .",
    "there is no theoretical reason to exclude poles of order higher than one , and poles of any order will lead to the typical resonance phenomena for cross - section and phase shift , in particular , the time delay and therewith formation of a quasi - stationary state  @xcite . but",
    "higher order poles have been scorned , because they were somehow associated with a time evolution that in addition to the exponential had also a strong ( of order @xmath120 ) polynomial time dependence  @xcite for which there exists no experimental evidence . in the rigged hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics ,",
    "a vector description of resonances is possible , and gamow vectors and gamow states were defined from the first order pole of the s - matrix element .",
    "their hamiltonian time evolution was shown to be exactly exponential and given by a semigroup  @xcite .",
    "this procedure was generalized to an @xmath0-th order pole at @xmath121 which led to the definition of @xmath0 gamow vectors of order @xmath122 .",
    "@xcite   the gamow vectors of order @xmath123 were shown to have indeed a polynomial time evolution in addition to the exponential  @xcite .",
    "however , one can find a non - reducible state operator in the @xmath0-dimensional space @xmath7 spanned by the @xmath0 gamow vectors , e.g. the operator  ( [ con0 ] ) , which has a purely exponential time evolution  @xcite . in the paper at hand we investigated the question , to what extend the requirement of a purely exponential time evolution with a lifetime",
    "@xmath124 determines the form of the state opeerator . from rather plausible assumptions we concluded that this must be a `` mixture '' of operators like  ( [ con0 ] ) with arbitrary coefficients @xmath111 as given by  ( [ con2 ] )"
