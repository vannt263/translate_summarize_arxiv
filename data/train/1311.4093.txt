    "during the last few decades , considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the solar atmosphere due to the increased availability of observational data and the development of analytical and numerical models of the solar wind .",
    "one aspect of this development is the construction of complex three - dimensional ( 3d ) models .",
    "these models can be validated with observations and further refined to improve the comparison .",
    "important in the further progress of these models is a better understanding of the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration problem .",
    "improvements in the theories of the coronal heating scenarios may result in more realistic models that are more reliable in predicting the solar wind conditions .",
    "eventually , this may further improve the numerical forecasting of space weather events .",
    "recent hinode observations suggested that there is more than enough energy in the chromospheric magnetic field fluctuations , which propagate away from the sun , to heat the solar corona and maintain the temperatures at @xmath0mk @xcite . with the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ) these waves were shown to be ubiquitously present in the transition region and low corona @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that it is therefore appealing to develop a 3d solar corona and inner heliosphere model that is based on alfvn wave turbulence and check if such a theoretical model reproduces emission features seen in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) images . in our previous corona model @xcite , we demonstrated that alfvn wave turbulence can indeed capture the overall observable euv emission , with the exception of some of the details such as the emission around active regions .",
    "there is a long history of alfvn wave turbulence in the solar wind that dates back to the pioneering work of @xcite , who concluded that turbulence is important in the solar wind near @xmath0au based on _ mariner 2 _ measurements .",
    "the earliest solar wind models that incorporated alfvn wave turbulence were presented in @xcite and @xcite , followed by 2d global corona models by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite constructed a self - consistent 1d alfvn wave turbulence model from the photosphere to inner heliosphere that included wave reflection and mode conversion from alfvn to slow waves .",
    "this model was generalized to 2d by @xcite to account for turbulent cascade .",
    "alfvn waves that propagate outward from the sun are partially reflected by gradients due to stratification , which produces waves propagating in opposite directions , see for instance @xcite .",
    "counter - propagating waves are essential for the classical incompressible cascade @xcite and hence the coronal heating .",
    "the reflection due to strong magnetic field gradients may be important in close proximity of the active regions , further intensifying the dissipation and the observable euv emission . in the present paper , we will determine if this enhanced wave reflection does improve our model comparison with the observed euv images .",
    "remote observations from the ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ) have shown that the perpendicular ion temperature is much larger than the parallel ion temperature in the corona holes @xcite .",
    "similarly , helios observations have shown that the ion temperature in the inner heliosphere is anisotropic as well @xcite .",
    "several models have been constructed that take the ion temperature anisotropy into account , see for instance @xcite for 1d analysis and @xcite for 2d analysis .",
    "the ion temperature anisotropy has , to the best of our knowledge , not yet been incorporated in a 3d solar wind model .    in recent years",
    ", our solar wind efforts in the space weather modeling framework ( swmf , @xcite ) were focused on creating an alfvn wave turbulence - driven solar corona and inner heliosphere model with a two - temperature approach for the electrons and ions .",
    "our goal is to develop a single validated model that can produce realistic synthesized line - of - sight ( los ) images in the multi - wavelength euv , and accurate @xmath0au prediction of the solar wind properties .",
    "this model will also produce realistic background solar wind for simulations of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "@xcite constructed a solar wind model that has an inner boundary in the @xmath0mk corona and has separate electron and ion temperatures .",
    "it incorporated the collisional electron heat conduction and alfvn wave transport and dissipation along the open field lines .",
    "this model was validated in @xcite , while @xcite enhanced the model by including surface alfvn waves .",
    "the two - temperature approach is important in producing a correct cme shock , otherwise a strong and unphysical heat precursor can appear ahead of the cme due to the heat conduction @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite developed a lower corona model that was able to reproduce synthesized euv images , but for the coronal heating the model did still rely on ad hoc coronal heating functions .",
    "@xcite combined the aforementioned efforts into a single two - temperature model with alfvn wave turbulence by incorporating the concept of balanced turbulence at the apex of the closed field lines , and via a concise analysis , the model was able to numerically resolve the upper chromosphere and transition region .",
    "this model was able to reproduce the overall morphology of coronal holes and active regions in the euv images .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that it was also able to capture the charge state evolution , while @xcite compared the model output to in - situ ulysses observations .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a 3d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) lower corona model based on a combination of ad hoc coronal heating functions and with heat conduction was able to well reproduce many features in the observed euv images .",
    "@xcite showed that the enlil inner heliosphere mhd model prescribed by the empirical wang  sheeley  arge ( wsa ) model @xcite was able to capture the @xmath0au observations , while @xcite used the wsa to prescribe the coupled corona and inner inner heliosphere simulations to obtain @xmath0au results .    in the approach taken in the alfvn wave solar model ( awsom ) described in the current paper ,",
    "we no longer rely on ad hoc heating functions . the physics incorporated into the awsom model",
    "allows us to produce realistic los images and @xmath0au solar wind predictions in one single model .",
    "we present the theoretical approach and results in two companion papers .",
    "the present paper is the first one and describes the coronal heating methodology and electron heat conduction and presents the resulting synthesized images of the multi - wavelength euv emission .",
    "we also demonstrate the newly implemented low dissipation mp5 limiter @xcite in the bats - r - us model .",
    "the reduced numerical dissipation allows us to clearly resolve the fine details in the solution , and allow a better comparison with observations . our second paper , x. meng et al . ( in preparation ) , describes the impact of these changes on the solar wind acceleration and the @xmath0au comparisons .    the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ]",

    "we provide the derivation of the alfvn wave propagation , reflection , and dissipation . in section [ sec : aniso ]",
    ", we generalize this model to three temperatures by using anisotropic ion temperatures and the isotropic electron temperature .",
    "the implementation is described in section [ sec : setup ] . in section [ sec : results ] , we demonstrate the performance of this model for carrington rotation ( cr ) 2107 by comparing euv images with observations .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] and provide details of the derivations in the appendices .",
    "we now present the equations of the awsom model .",
    "we first describe the two - temperature mhd equations for the electrons and ions to demonstrate the incorporation of the alfvn wave turbulence and collisionless heat conduction .",
    "the details of the derivation of the alfvn wave equations are presented in section [ sec : turbulence ] . in section [ sec : aniso ] , these equations are generalized to ion temperature anisotropy . in section [ sec :",
    "setup ] , we give some details of the numerical implementation .",
    "we finalize this section with a discussion on the boundary conditions ( section [ sec : bc ] ) .",
    "the starting point of our model is the mhd equations , which well describe the large - scale , low - frequency phenomena of the solar corona and inner heliosphere plasma . in the inertial frame ,",

    "we smoothly transition between these formulations @xmath32 here , the fraction of spitzer heat flux is defined as a function of @xmath10 @xmath33 where @xmath34 similar to @xcite .",
    "the spitzer form is in this way the dominant heat flux contributor near the sun where the density is high enough so that the electron temperature length scale @xmath35 is much larger than the collisional mean free path of the electrons ( this is not correct for part of the transition region , but we ignore that fact in the present paper ) , while far away from the sun the collisionless heat flux is more significant . in appendix",
    "[ sec : collisionless ] , we describe the numerical implementation of the collisionless heat flux .",
    "the electron and ion heating functions are denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",

    "equation ( [ eq : elsasser1 ] ) for @xmath79 demonstrates that even in a linear approximation , the wkb approach dismisses the correlations between inward and outward propagating waves .",

    "this direction is under the imcompressibility condition , @xmath59 , transverse to the magnetic field .",
    "such surface reflection can for instance arise at coronal loop boundaries and streamer boundaries , ultimately resulting in enhanced heating near these locations . in the present paper",

    "now , we apply this transformation in equation ( [ eq : wpmfull ] ) and repeat the above procedure to check how equation ( [ eq : etotal ] ) is modified .",
    "second , if we admit a non - zero correlator @xmath96 , then we should use the full magnetic pressure ( [ eq : wavepreslong ] ) in the momentum equation .",

    "one can find that in the equation analogous to ( [ eq : etotal ] ) the wave pressure is changed for @xmath99 and the non - divergent term breaking the energy conservation appears in the left hand side as follows : @xmath100 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\nabla\\cdot\\left[\\left(w_++w_-+p_a^{\\rm full}\\right){\\bf    u}+\\left(w_+-w_-\\right){\\bf v}_a\\right]+q_{\\rm noncons}= -\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf q}_e - q_{\\rm rad } -\\rho\\frac{gm_\\sun}{r^3}{\\bf",

    "we also accounted for the term @xmath116 , which we omitted while deriving equation ( [ eq : wpmfull ] ) under the assumption of @xmath58 .",
    "we omitted all terms related to the ion and electron pressures and their variations .",

    "the non - convervative source , @xmath117 appears to come with the opposite sign to the newly derived equation , meaning that this source describes the energy non - linear conversion from transverse alfvn waves to the compressible mode with @xmath118 , i.e. magnetosonic waves .",
    "we arrive at an important conclusion : the model of equation ( [ eq : wpmfull ] ) allowing a correlation between the oscillations in the oppositely propagating waves is not closed unless the model for compressible turbulence is included .",

    "the neglect can be justified only if the reflection coefficient is limited in such way , that the maximum admissible value , corresponding to the equality case in the following estimate : @xmath132\\cdot[\\nabla\\times{\\bf      u}]+ ( { \\bf z}_+\\cdot{\\bf z}_-)({\\bf v}_a\\cdot\\nabla)\\log v_a\\right|}{|{\\bf z}_-||{\\bf z}_+|}\\le \\sqrt{\\left({\\bf b}\\cdot[\\nabla\\times{\\bf      u}]\\right)^2+\\left[({\\bf v}_a\\cdot\\nabla)\\log      v_a\\right]^2},\\ ] ] can be only achieved if one of the waves dominates over the opposite , so that @xmath133 . in this case , the amplitude and polarization of the minor wave are imposed by those for the dominant wave , the sign of the correlator is governed by the requirement that , in the course of reflection , the dominant wave should decrease , the oppositely propagating `` reflected '' wave should grow . if the oppositely propagating waves are comparable , they are assumed to be non - correlated .",

    "we additionally omit the time derivate as we focus in this paper on the steady state solar wind , and hence , equation ( [ eq : electron ] ) can be simplified as @xmath231 + q_e.\\ ] ] the first term on both the left hand side and the right hand side can be combined , resulting in @xmath232 where we have introduced a new polytropic index @xmath233 for the electrons in the collisionless regime : @xmath234 for our standard values @xmath31 ( taken from @xcite ) and @xmath21 , we obtain @xmath235 . by reintroducing the missing terms of equation ( [ eq : electron ] ) , we obtain our final evolution equation for the electron pressure : @xmath236 where @xmath237 interpolates the electron polytropic index @xmath238 between the collisional regime where @xmath239 and the collisionless regime where @xmath240 and the interpolation function @xmath241 is taken to be the same as equation ( [ eq : interpolation ] ) .",
    "the @xmath242 in @xmath243 indicates that we set @xmath244 in the electron heat flux ( [ eq : heatflux ] ) , i.e. @xmath245 , since it is now parameterized via a spatially varying @xmath238 .",
    "the main difference between equation ( [ eq : electronpressuregamma ] ) and ( [ eq : electron ] ) is the use of @xmath238 instead of @xmath246 in the time derivative , and hence , the time evolution of both ( ad hoc ) formulations is different . as a final note , we mention that a spatially varying electron polytropic index does not negatively impact the shock evolution of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "since the electron speed of sound is much larger than the cme speeds , only the ions will be heated by the cme shock .",
    "the ion fluid still uses the standard polytropic index @xmath21 .",

    "<S> we present a new version of the alfvn wave solar model ( awsom ) , a global model from the upper chromosphere to the corona and the heliosphere . the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration are addressed with low - frequency alfvn wave turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the injection of alfvn wave energy at the inner boundary is such that the poynting flux is proportional to the magnetic field strength . </S>",
    "<S> the three - dimensional magnetic field topology is simulated using data from photospheric magnetic field measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this model does not impose open - closed magnetic field boundaries ; those develop self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the physics includes : ( 1 ) the model employs three different temperatures , namely the isotropic electron temperature and the parallel and perpendicular ion temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the firehose , mirror , and ion - cyclotron instabilities due to the developing ion temperature anisotropy are accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the alfvn waves are partially reflected by the alfvn speed gradient and the vorticity along the field lines . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting counter - propagating waves are responsible for the nonlinear turbulent cascade . </S>",
    "<S> the balanced turbulence due to uncorrelated waves near the apex of the closed field lines and the resulting elevated temperatures are addressed . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) to apportion the wave dissipation to the three temperatures , we employ the results of the theories of linear wave damping and nonlinear stochastic heating . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) we have incorporated the collisional and collisionless electron heat conduction . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the simulated multi - wavelength euv images of cr2107 with the observations from _ stereo_/euvi and _ sdo_/aia instruments . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the reflection due to strong magnetic fields in proximity of active regions intensifies the dissipation and observable emission sufficiently . </S>"
