    "modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) was proposed by milgrom ( 1983 ) that gravitational field needs modifications when the field strength @xmath0 is weaker than a critical value @xmath1 .",
    "this has been shown to be a good candidate as an alternative to cosmic dark matter ( sanders 2001 ) .",
    "the phenomenological foundations for mond are based on two observational facts : ( 1 ) flat asymptotic rotation curve , ( 2 ) the successful tully - fisher ( tf ) law , @xmath5 ( tully & fisher 1977 ) for the relation between rotation velocity and luminosity in spiral galaxies . here",
    "@xmath6 is close to 4 .    in this paper , one proposes a different view of mond by looking at the physics related by the mass distribution and the coordinate scale of the system .",
    "in addition , one finds it useful to separate the effective gravitation field @xmath2 into a small scale ( or short - distance ) @xmath3 field and a large scale ( or a long - distance ) @xmath4 field that should be helpful for a better understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "the effective potential is obtained .",
    "possible relation with the induced gravity model is also discussed .",
    "if dark matter does not exit , rotation curve observations indicate that @xmath0 behaves as @xmath7 , a typical @xmath8-dimensional attraction field , at large distance greater than the galactic scale around @xmath9 lightyears . at short distance",
    ", @xmath0 goes like @xmath10 , a typical behavior of a @xmath11-dimensional attraction field .",
    "therefore , it is also very interesting to study the changing pattern of the _ effective dimension _ @xmath12 which will be defined as a function of the physical scale @xmath13 .",
    "one will plot this @xmath12 functions hoping for a better understanding of the changing pattern of the _ effective dimension_. possible speculation with the kaluza - klein theory will be discussed in this paper too .",
    "we will start by showing how to simplify the expression of mond field strength by writing it with suitable scale parameters .",
    "our aim is to write all physical quantities in dimensionless form with suitable physical units .",
    "first of all , it was pointed out ( milgrom 1983 ) that there exists a critical acceleration parameter @xmath14 characterizing the turning point of the effective power law associated with the gravitational field in mond .",
    "gravitational field of the following form was suggested @xmath15 with a function @xmath16 considered as a modified inertial . here",
    "@xmath17 is the newtonian gravitational field produced by certain mass distribution .",
    "milgrom argues that @xmath18 provides a best fit with many existing observation data including the rotational curve of many spiral galaxies .",
    "observations are selected mostly from the most reliable @xmath19 cm hydrogen line measurements .",
    "the 21 cm hydrogen line is the photon emission due to the superfine energy difference resulting from the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions between the cored proton and orbiting electron .",
    "the existing neutron hydrogen all around the invisible region of spiral galaxies provides better estimates on the rotation curves beyond the visible region of spiral galaxies .",
    "milgrom also points out that the critical parameter @xmath1 is close to the value of @xmath20 .",
    "it is also the gravitational field produced by an @xmath21 massive particle at its compton surface .",
    "indeed , one finds that @xmath22 .",
    "milgrom hence speculates that mond could have to do with the quantum theory of the universe .",
    "milgrom s original idea is that the gravitational field needs modification when @xmath0 is weaker than critical field strength @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to find that @xmath23 if we define the scale length @xmath24 via the following equation @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the solar mass .",
    "note that one takes @xmath28 close to the order of magnitude of a typical galaxy similar to our milky way .",
    "taking a different value of @xmath28 will only change the value of @xmath24 . selecting different value of @xmath28 and",
    "hence @xmath24 will not affect our arguments in this paper .",
    "one chooses @xmath28 and hence the corresponding @xmath24 simply to set them as units of scale .",
    "physics will not be affected by the choice of unit .",
    "one observes , however , that @xmath24 is pretty close to the radial size of the visible boundary of our milky way if @xmath28 is chosen close to the total visible mass of milky way .",
    "this is certainly true as modification is needed only at large scale according to mond . starting next section",
    ", one will try to write the modified field strength @xmath0 in a dimensionless form with the help of the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath24 and @xmath1 .",
    "the idea is to write @xmath29 , @xmath13 and @xmath0 in units of @xmath28 , @xmath24 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "milgrom argues that one can take the effective inertial @xmath16 as @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , one obtains @xmath31 by dividing both sides of the equation [ [ gm ] ] by the critical parameter @xmath1 .",
    "one can therefore write above equation as @xmath32 with @xmath0 and @xmath17 written in unit of @xmath1 .",
    "this makes @xmath0 and @xmath17 dimensionless from now on .    throughout this paper , we will focuss on the study of the system with a newtonian attraction of the form @xmath33 .",
    "this is the field strength at a radial distance @xmath13 from a spherical distributed matter with total mass @xmath34 .",
    "system with different mass distribution can be obtained straightforwardly .",
    "note that @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath36 if @xmath17 , @xmath13 and @xmath34 are written in unit of @xmath1 , @xmath24 and @xmath28 respectively . therefore , the modified field strength @xmath0 can be written as @xmath37 one can further suppress the parameter @xmath34 by defining @xmath38 and write @xmath13 as a dimensionless coordinate variable in unit of @xmath39 instead of @xmath24 . as a result , one can write above equation in a very compact form @xmath40 in terms of above dimensionless parameters . to emphasize again , one writes @xmath41 in order to simplify the expression of the modified equation and make @xmath0 , @xmath17 , and @xmath13 dimensionless for convenience .",
    "it is straightforward to restore all dimension parameters when one needs to evaluate any corresponding physical values .",
    "first of all , eq . (",
    "[ 1 ] ) can be solved to write @xmath2 as a function of @xmath13 : @xmath42 .\\ ] ] one can plot the functions @xmath2 and compare it with the functions @xmath7 and @xmath10 for a better picture of its small scale and large scale behaviors .",
    "indeed , figure [ fig1 ] shows the behavior of @xmath43 , and @xmath10 together for comparison .",
    "because the difference at short distance scale is too small for comparison , one also plot it in logarithmic scale .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] was plotted as logarithm of these functions to enlarge the small difference among these functions in the short distance region .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath2 goes like @xmath10 at short distance scale where @xmath44 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath2 goes like @xmath7 at large distance scale where @xmath45 .",
    "one can also easily tell from the figures that they agree with our analytic approximation at both the regions @xmath44 and @xmath45 one obtained earlier .    more importantly , writing @xmath2 as a function of @xmath46 clearly shows that the newtonian gravitational field receives significant modification only when @xmath47 , or equivalently , @xmath48 .",
    "this is in fact equivalent to the assumption made by milgrom that significant modification is required when @xmath49 .",
    "the picture looking at the physics related to the physical scale is however easier for a better understanding of possible underlying physics .",
    "indeed , one easily finds that , if eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is the correct gravitational field for all scales , the effective dimension of the system seems to decrease from 3 to 2 as the scale @xmath13 increases .",
    "geometric dimension seem to decrease if one increase the physical scale of interest .",
    "the major difference is that the critical scale depends not only on @xmath50 but also proportional to @xmath51 , the square - root of the total mass of the system .",
    "one recalls that kaluza - klein theory proposes that observable physical dimension of a system increases as the physical length scale decreases , or equivalently , the energy scale increases .",
    "one will be able to observe higher dimensional effect at shorter distance scale according to kaluza - klein s original idea .",
    "the situation here is quite similar .",
    "when the physical length scale increases , the effective physical dimension appears to decreases from 3 to 2 .",
    "moreover , the critical length scale @xmath52 depends on the total mass of the system .",
    "if @xmath34 increases , equivalent to the increasing of total energy of the system , mond modification is only apparent at larger scale .",
    "imagine one approaches a system from a large distance area .",
    "one will be able to see the effect of one more dimension as one approaches closer to the center of the system . increasing @xmath34 will make one easier to see the differences at the same physical length scale .",
    "this agrees with the central idea of kaluza - klein approach .",
    "one can possibly say that energy or mass opens up more dimensions if eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , or any similar expression of the mond field strength , is the correct equation for the gravitational field .",
    "note that one can also tell from eq .",
    "[ 2 ] that one can expand the effective theory in @xmath13 if one needs analytic form of the theory either at short or large scale .",
    "the expansion in @xmath13 is in fact the expansion in @xmath53 .",
    "when the scale length @xmath53 is small , it returns to the conventional newtonian model .",
    "it will receive significant modification when @xmath13 is large compared to @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , attention should be addressed to the physical origin of the parameter @xmath39 .    in order to take a more close look at the changing pattern of the above @xmath0 , one can split it into two different parts : @xmath54 note that the first term is @xmath4 that goes like @xmath7 when @xmath55 , while the second term is @xmath3 that goes like @xmath10 when @xmath56 .",
    "therefore it is easy to see that @xmath4 and @xmath3 represents the long distance and short distance field strength of the @xmath0 respectively .",
    "one is hoping that successful separation of @xmath0 may shed more light in the search of the underlying theory .",
    "in fact , one can show that @xmath57 and hence , @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "this indicates that the first order correction to the short - range gravitational field @xmath0 is @xmath60 in comparison to the @xmath10 newtonian interaction .",
    "hence the first order correction is fourth order in @xmath13 .",
    "this correction is very tiny if one takes the mass @xmath34 to be the solar mass @xmath27 . in this case",
    "the critical radius @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the first order correction @xmath62 at a distance from our sun near @xmath63 au , would be around a small difference near @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 denotes the newtonian gravitational field at a distance @xmath63 au from our sun .",
    "this would probably large enough to be measured in the near future .    in figure [ fig3 ] one plots @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for comparison .",
    "we also plot the logarithm of these functions in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in order to signify the small difference in short distance .",
    "in addition , one can also compute the changing rate of the gravitational field for the following equation of running gravitational field @xmath68 if we define @xmath69 as a parameter simulating the effect of the conjugated momentum , one can also show that the changing rate @xmath70 obeys the following equation @xmath71 these equations play the role similar to the renormalization group equation for a quantum field theory .",
    "in addition , eq . [ [ rg ] ] also states that @xmath2 decreases monotonically as @xmath13 increases .",
    "similarly , eq . [ [ rgk ] ] indicates that @xmath72 increases monotonically as @xmath73 increases .",
    "one can integrate @xmath0 for the effective potential . after some algebra",
    ", one can show that the effective potential @xmath74 and similarly for @xmath75 can be evaluated directly to give @xmath76 and @xmath77 one can verify directly that @xmath78 and @xmath79 and prove that above equations are indeed correct up to an irrelevant integration constant .",
    "in fact , it is difficult to specify this constant of integration in the conventional approach which take @xmath80 .",
    "this is because the effective potential in fact diverges at spatial infinity due to the logarithm behavior of the dominating 2d - like potential .    in order to take a look at the form of these effective potential , one plots @xmath81 and @xmath82 together in fig .",
    "it is easy to find that @xmath83 has a flat plateau area when @xmath59 indicating that @xmath4 contributes little to @xmath0 at short distance .",
    "similarly , one finds that the slope of @xmath82 becomes constant as @xmath84 indicating that @xmath3 is significant only at short distance scale .",
    "note that , the series sum in @xmath82 converges quickly .",
    "one takes @xmath85 when we plot fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "one knows that the four dimensional space time is modified when the physical scale becomes small in the kaluza - klein theory .",
    "recent evidences in mond research seems to imply that the effective dimension of our universe decreases as the length scale increases .",
    "it is possible that kaluza - klein approach could play an important , but quite different , role for large scale system .",
    "the observed rotation curve of spiral galaxies indicates that the gravitational attraction goes as @xmath7 in all directions without the existence of any cosmic dark matter .",
    "this is , however , quite different from the conventional geometry of any two dimensional space .",
    "but the success of mond seems to indicate a new direction of dimensional effect .",
    "it is then very interesting to study how the effective dimension decreases as the observation scale increases .",
    "therefore , one manages to define an effective dimension in this paper hoping to find our way to the discovery of the underlying theory .",
    "indeed , one can define the effective dimension @xmath12 by the definition @xmath86 such that @xmath87 as @xmath59 and @xmath88 as @xmath89 .",
    "this is a naive way to define an effective dimension such that @xmath90 will signify the geometric dimension as @xmath11-dimension and @xmath8-dimension respectively in a close way .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that @xmath91 and hence , @xmath92 note , however , that this definition of @xmath12 fails to tell us anything when @xmath93 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath90 is ill - defined at @xmath94 which is an obvious result of eq .",
    "one resolution to this problem is to introduce a @xmath95-shaped smooth function @xmath96 that peaks at @xmath94 reaching the value @xmath97 and reaching @xmath98 both at @xmath99 and @xmath89 such that @xmath100 renders @xmath12 well defined at @xmath94 .",
    "indeed , one can show that @xmath101 in short , the prescribed @xmath95-shaped function @xmath96 absorbs the discrepancy of the function @xmath12 at @xmath94 in order to make the @xmath90 function well - defined everywhere including @xmath94 . for simplicity , one will choose @xmath102\\sqrt{r } \\exp [ 1-\\sqrt{r } ] .\\ ] ]",
    "one can easily show that this function peaks at @xmath94 reaching the value @xmath103 and reaches @xmath98 both at @xmath99 and @xmath89 as required . and",
    "it has little effect elsewhere .",
    "this is exactly the function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig41 ] .",
    "in addition , figure [ fig9 ] shows @xmath96 and @xmath2 together for comparison .",
    "therefore , one can plot the function of effective dimension @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]    note that the effective dimension function @xmath12 does not represent the physical dimension of the theory .",
    "it only tells us roughly and effectively how the gravitational field @xmath0 varies as @xmath13 increases . in one aspect",
    ", one could view the potential as distortion of the geometry and the effective potential as the stiffness of the distorted geometry .",
    "since the @xmath7 effect holds in all direction at large scale , not just along the disk plane , this behavior is quite different from simple geometric and dimensional deformation .",
    "all evidences indicate this sort of geometry deserves more attention .",
    "in this paper , one proposes a different view of mond by looking at the physics related by the mass distribution and the coordinate scale of the system .",
    "in addition , one finds it useful to separate the effective gravitation field @xmath2 into a small scale ( or short - distance ) @xmath3 field and a large scale ( or a long - distance ) @xmath4 field that should be helpful for a better understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "the effective potential is obtained accordingly .",
    "we have also studied the changing pattern of the _ effective dimension _ @xmath12 which will be defined as a function of the physical scale @xmath13 .",
    "one plots this @xmath12 functions hoping for a better understanding of the changing pattern of the _ effective dimension_. possible speculation with the kaluza - klein theory is also discussed in this paper too .",
