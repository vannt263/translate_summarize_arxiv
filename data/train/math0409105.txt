    "the number of domino tilings of the @xmath0 square with a centered hole of size @xmath1 , a figure known as the _ holey square _ and denoted @xmath2 , was conjectured by edward early to have the form @xmath3 .",
    "although the conjecture has remained unsolved until now , specific cases were known , for example see @xcite . in this paper , we answer the general conjecture in the affirmative , primarily via a theorem about tiling parity that has applications beyond the problem of the holey square .",
    "we also give combinatorial meaning to the odd factor @xmath4 in early s conjecture , and demonstrate other consequences of the parity theorem .    as this paper",
    "solely concerns domino tilings , all tilings discussed can be assumed to be domino tilings .",
    "following pachter s notation in @xcite , we write @xmath5 for the number of tilings of the region @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for the parity of the number of tilings of @xmath6 .",
    "when we are only concerned with the configuration of part of a region , we may only draw this portion , indicating that the undrawn portion is arbitrary .",
    "in this section , we present a theorem regarding the parity of the number of domino tilings of a region .",
    "this result depends only on a very local property of the region , and makes no further assumptions regarding symmetry , planarity , or any other aspect of the region .",
    "say that a region @xmath6 has an _ @xmath8-corner _ if there is a convex corner in @xmath6 where the segments bounding this corner have lengths @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "say that @xmath6 has an _ @xmath13-corner _ if there is a @xmath14-corner , a @xmath15-corner , and @xmath16 distinct @xmath17-corners configured as in figure  [ stp ] .",
    "[ stp ]    if one of the segments , say the segment of length @xmath9 , in an @xmath18-corner forms an @xmath19-corner at its other endpoint for some @xmath20 and @xmath21 , say that each of these corners is _ walled _ at @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath22-strip _ be a subregion of @xmath23 squares that has an @xmath22-corner .",
    "for @xmath24 , say that an @xmath18-corner in a region @xmath6 is _ complete up to @xmath25 _ if that corner is @xmath26-complete for @xmath27 , where an @xmath18-corner is _ @xmath28-complete _ if @xmath29 , and _ @xmath26-complete _ for @xmath30 if the following inductive definition is true .    1 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the @xmath32-strip in the @xmath18-corner .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be the two squares adjacent to the ends of @xmath31 but not along the edges forming the @xmath18-corner . if either @xmath33 or @xmath34 is in @xmath6 , then the @xmath35-strip between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , inclusively , all of whose squares are adjacent to @xmath31 , must also be a subregion of @xmath6 .",
    "2 .   consider the @xmath36-corner formed by removing @xmath31 from @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath37 , then this corner must be complete up to @xmath38 .",
    "3 .   the subregion of squares examined at each step of this definition must be the dual of a grid graph .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 has an @xmath39-corner that is complete up to @xmath40 , then this corner must have one of the following forms .",
    "@xmath41    similarly , if @xmath6 has an @xmath42-corner that is complete up to @xmath40 , the possibilities for this corner are as follows .",
    "@xmath43    the different tilings of @xmath6 can be categorized by the manner in which an @xmath18-corner is tiled .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 has an @xmath44-corner , then @xmath45    suppose @xmath6 has an @xmath39-corner where @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath46    where the corner drawn in each of the above figures is the particular @xmath39-corner in @xmath6 . if @xmath6 does not include the entire region tiled in one of these figures , that term is zero .",
    "notice that the first two of these figures tile the same subregion of @xmath6 , so in fact , @xmath47    suppose that a region @xmath6 has an @xmath18-corner .",
    "for any @xmath24 , if this corner is complete up to @xmath25 , then @xmath48    if @xmath49 , then also holds for @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , for any @xmath51 , if @xmath52 , the corner is complete up to @xmath9 , and the corner is walled at @xmath9 , then @xmath53    we prove the theorem by first inductively showing that for a particular @xmath51 , the statement is true for all @xmath18-corners complete up to @xmath54 .",
    "then we induct on @xmath51 . for any @xmath51",
    ", if holds for a particular @xmath25 , then certainly holds if there is a wall at @xmath55 , since one of the tilings pictured in the statement of is impossible because of the wall at @xmath9 , so this term is zero .",
    "suppose first that @xmath56 . that holds for @xmath50 is trivial , and",
    "the case @xmath57 was shown above .",
    "suppose that the theorem holds for all @xmath58 .",
    "suppose that an @xmath39-corner of @xmath6 is complete up to @xmath59 .",
    "this corner must also be complete up to @xmath60 , so we can apply for @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62    consider the first of these regions , and look at the possible ways to tile the square next to the shorter leg of the removed region .",
    "@xmath63    the latter of these creates a @xmath64-corner walled at @xmath65 , and this corner is complete up to @xmath65 because of the inductive definition of @xmath59-completeness .",
    "thus we can apply for @xmath66 to get @xmath67    there is an analogous equation for the second region on the right - hand side of , and the last term in also appears in this . since we are considering parity , these terms cancel , leaving @xmath68    which proves for @xmath69 , and consequently for @xmath69 .",
    "thus the result holds for all @xmath39-corners .",
    "now suppose that the theorem is true for all @xmath70 .",
    "suppose that a region @xmath6 has a @xmath71-corner where @xmath29 .",
    "first we must show that the result holds for this corner for @xmath57 , and then we can induct on @xmath25 .",
    "consider the @xmath72-corner in this @xmath71-corner .",
    "we can either place a vertical domino or a horizontal domino in this corner , which gives the following .",
    "@xmath73    observe that the first of these possibilities creates a @xmath74-corner which is necessarily complete up to @xmath28 .",
    "the second possible tiling creates a @xmath75-corner . to the former ,",
    "apply the theorem for @xmath76 and @xmath57 , and apply the theorem for @xmath56 and @xmath50 to the latter .",
    "both of these results are already known by the induction hypothesis .",
    "thus @xmath77    the second and third of these tile the same region , so when we consider @xmath7 , we see that the theorem is true for @xmath57 .",
    "now suppose that for this @xmath78 , the theorem holds for all @xmath79 , and that there is an @xmath71-corner of @xmath6 complete up to @xmath59 .",
    "as in the case of a @xmath39-corner , this corner must also be complete up to @xmath60 , so we can apply for @xmath61 .",
    "the remainder of the proof follows from methods that are entirely analogous to the case when @xmath56 .",
    "this completes the proof for all @xmath18-corners complete up to @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "counting the number of tilings of the holey square can be simplified using two known results , both of which rely on the holey square s symmetries .",
    "a result of jockusch , see @xcite , indicates that @xmath81 is either a square or twice a square . in @xcite",
    ", ciucu defines a klein - symmetric graph as a bipartite graph with @xmath82-degree rotational symmetry and a reflective axis of symmetry that separates the graph .",
    "say that a region in the plane is klein - symmetric if its dual is a klein - symmetric graph .",
    "the region @xmath2 is klein - symmetric with each diagonal serving as a reflexive axis of symmetry , so we can apply the factorization theorem in @xcite to conclude that @xmath83 for a region @xmath84 defined as follows . consider the @xmath0 square , coordinatized so that the lower left corner is at the origin and the upper right corner has coordinates @xmath85 .",
    "divide the square into two congruent halves by the two - unit segments    @xmath86 \\times \\{2n - ( 2t+1)\\ } : t = 0 , \\ldots , n-1\\big\\}$ ]    @xmath87 : t = 1 , \\ldots , n-1\\big\\}.$ ]    now remove the center @xmath1 square from the region .",
    "this leaves two congruent regions , denote each by @xmath84 .",
    "notice that in any tiling of @xmath84 , one particular domino must always be in place . in figure  [ halfhs",
    "] , this is the domino occupying the two bottom - rightmost squares .",
    "let @xmath88 be @xmath84 with these two squares removed .",
    "there is an obvious bijection between tilings of @xmath84 and tilings of @xmath88 , so @xmath89 , and in particular these numbers have the same parity .",
    "[ halfhs ]    to prove the conjecture we need to prove that @xmath90 .",
    "our proof is inductive for fixed @xmath91 , with base case @xmath92 .",
    "this base case is trivial , as it is easy to see that @xmath93 and @xmath94 can be tiled in two ways .    for all @xmath91 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , where the factor @xmath4 is equal to @xmath97 .",
    "assume that @xmath90 .",
    "as discussed above , it remains to show only that @xmath98 .",
    "consider the region @xmath99 which has a -corner walled at @xmath100 , and this corner is complete up to @xmath100 .",
    "therefore we can apply the parity theorem to this corner , specifically .",
    "the subregion indicated by the right - hand side of is actually @xmath84 reflected across the line @xmath101 .",
    "therefore @xmath102 .",
    "this completes the proof since @xmath103 , answering affirmatively the question posed by early , and giving a combinatorial meaning to the odd factor in @xmath81 .",
    "analogous to @xmath2 , let @xmath104 be the @xmath105 square with a centered hole of size @xmath106 .    for all @xmath91 and @xmath95 , @xmath107 .",
    "the proof is analogous to the proof of the previous corollary , and once again the odd factor @xmath108 is the number of domino tilings of a particular region .",
    "in addition to determining the number of domino tilings of the holey square , the parity theorem can be applied to other regions .",
    "one easy consequence is the following .          for another application ,",
    "let @xmath110 be the @xmath111 rectangle , and notice that each corner is complete up to @xmath112 .",
    "we can repeatedly apply the parity theorem to @xmath113 to obtain the following result .        to describe",
    "the process more precisely , suppose that @xmath113 is oriented so that the sides of length @xmath116 are vertical .",
    "the upper left corner is complete up to @xmath116 , so apply the parity theorem to remove the -strip from this corner . similarly ,",
    "if the values of @xmath25 and @xmath114 are sufficiently large , we can remove the -strip from the upper right corner , the -strip from the lower right corner , and the -strip from the lower left corner ( where each of these corners are of subsequent subregions of @xmath113 ) .    the process of removing each strip can be summarized in the following table describing how many squares are removed from the sides of the region , starting with @xmath113 , after each application of the parity theorem .",
    "we can continue to apply the parity theorem until the @xmath117-strip we remove is actually from an @xmath117-corner . to determine when this might happen , we need to solve any of the following equations , where the term subtracted from the left side of each refers to the squares occupied by previously removed corners .",
    "@xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121    these equations correspond to the final @xmath117-strip being removed from the lower left corner , the upper left corner , the upper right corner , and the lower right corner , respectively .",
    "the solution to is @xmath122 or @xmath123 , the solution to is @xmath124 or @xmath125 , the solution to is @xmath122 or @xmath126 , and the solution to is @xmath124 or @xmath127 . since @xmath114 , @xmath25 , and @xmath128 are positive integers , several of these cases are impossible .",
    "thus the applications of the parity theorem cease in the manner described above when @xmath129 or when @xmath130 or @xmath131 , depending on the parity of @xmath25 .",
    "suppose that @xmath132 , and let @xmath25 be even .",
    "set @xmath128 to be @xmath133 .",
    "after removing the @xmath134 strip from @xmath113 , it is not hard to see that we are left with the subregion of @xmath113 formed by removing the top @xmath128 rows , the bottom @xmath128 rows , the left @xmath135 columns , and the right @xmath128 columns .",
    "the remaining region is @xmath136 , so @xmath137    if , on the other hand , @xmath25 is odd , let @xmath138 . after removing the @xmath134 strip from @xmath113",
    ", we likewise find that the resulting subregion of @xmath113 is @xmath113 with the top @xmath128 rows , the bottom @xmath139 rows , the left @xmath128 columns , and the right @xmath128 columns removed . since @xmath126 , this once again gives .",
    "it should be noted that there are other ways to obtain this result , for example using kasteleyn s formula or determinants of particular matrices .",
    "however , these methods tend to be much more analytic , and thus somewhat less intuitively clear , than the combinatorial proof presented here .    in corollary  [ kncor ] , we studied @xmath39-corners .",
    "we conclude this section by considering more general types of corners .",
    "let @xmath145 be the region with rows , whose rows from top to bottom consist of the following number of squares : @xmath128 , , @xmath146 , , @xmath146 , , where there are @xmath26 rows of boxes .",

    "in each of these regions , the centers of the rows are aligned along a vertical line .",
    "we can use the parity theorem to determine the parities of many different @xmath145 and @xmath147 .",
