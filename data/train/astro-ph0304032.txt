    "markarian 6 ( mrk  6 , ic  0450 ; @xmath8 ; 77  mpc distant for @xmath9 ) is one of a handful of intermediate seyferts of type  1.5 , including ngc  4151 and mrk  766 , showing evidence for an ` ionization cone ' rather than the ` ionization halo ' expected for a type  1 viewing geometry ( meaburn , whitehead , & pedlar 1989 ; kukula et  al .  1996 ) .",
    "a torus ` atmosphere ' along the line of sight has been suggested to explain the presence of the ionization cone ( e.g. , evans et al .",
    "the torus atmosphere is thought to be optically thick for ionizing radiation between the lyman edge and soft x - rays , but it allows radiation outside of this spectral range ( e.g. , broad optical line emission from the broad line region ) to pass through with only moderate obscuration .",
    "mrk  6 shows significant optical line profile variations on time - scales of months to years , suggesting that at least some of the gaseous material creating the lines can undergo coherent variations ( e.g. , rosenblatt et  al .  1992 ; eracleous & halpern 1993 ) .",
    "x - ray investigations of seyfert galaxies are well suited to probing matter along the line of sight toward their central black hole regions .",
    "prominent examples of intermediate seyferts that have been well studied in x - rays include the ` cousins ' of mrk  6 , ngc  4151 ( e.g. , weaver et  al .",
    "1994 ; ogle et  al .",
    "2000 ; yang , wilson , & ferruit 2001 ; schurch & warwick 2002 ) and mrk  766 ( e.g. , leighly et  al .",
    "1996 ; page et  al .   1999 , 2001 ;",
    "matt et  al .  2000 ; branduardi - raymont et  al .  2001 ) .",
    "in contrast , the only published x - ray study of mrk  6 is that of feldmeier et  al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter f99 ) using 0.69.5  kev  data .",
    "these data revealed heavy and complex x - ray absorption that was best fit by a double partial - covering model with large column densities [ @xmath10@xmath11 , likely due to the torus atmosphere .",
    "however , detailed x - ray spectral modeling was limited by modest photon statistics and the fact that the absorption in mrk  6 dominates the x - ray spectrum throughout most of the  bandpass .",
    "we capitalized on the superior throughput ( about an order of magnitude higher than ) and good spectral resolution of the instruments onboard   to investigate further the x - ray emission and absorption properties of mrk  6 .",
    "we also used the  data to perform sensitive searches for temporal and spectral variability during the observation and in comparison with earlier  and  observations .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    mrk  6 was observed with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) onboard  ( jansen et  al .",
    "2001 ) with on - source exposure times of 31.8  ks ( epic p - n ) and 30.8  ks ( epic mos  1 and mos  2 ) .",
    "it was also observed with the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) for 46.4  ks ( rgs  1 ) and 37.9  ks ( rgs  2 ) .",
    "the epic data allow sensitive imaging spectroscopy with moderate spectral ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) and angular ( @xmath14 fwhm ) resolution .",
    "the parameters of the individual observations are listed in tab .",
    "[ obs_tab ] .",
    "both the p - n and mos data were acquired in ` full - frame mode ' using the medium filter .",
    "the data were reduced using the science analysis system ( sas ) v5.3.3 with the latest calibration products . due to background flares at the end of the observation period , 7% of the",
    "p - n and 31% of the mos  1 and mos  2 data were rejected .",
    "after inspection of a source - free background spectrum extracted from ccd 1 on the p - n and mos detectors , we selected data only in the 0.312  kev energy range due to enhanced background at low photon energies ( up to a factor of @xmath15 ) .",
    "we furthermore excluded bad and hot pixels from the data .",
    "since the cleaned rgs data did not yield enough photon statistics for spectral analysis , they were not used further .",
    "source counts were extracted for the p - n and mos detectors within @xmath16-radius circular regions ( the 85% encircled - energy radius at 7.5  kev ) .",
    "the background was extracted locally from source - free regions . for the p - n we used a rectangular region of size @xmath17 close to mrk  6 on the same p - n chip , and for the mos we used an annulus with inner and outer radii of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . given the observed count rates of @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the p - n and mos detectors ,",
    "the pile - up fractions and dead times are estimated to be @xmath22% .",
    "the source counts were binned with a minimum of @xmath13 counts per bin to allow @xmath23 spectral fitting .",
    "we also constructed background - corrected light curves of mrk  6 in the soft ( 0.32  kev ) , hard ( 212  kev ) , and broad ( 0.312  kev ) bands by binning the events into 250  s intervals and excluding telemetry dropouts .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    archival  mecs 2 + 3 ( medium energy concentrator spectrometer ) and lecs ( low energy concentrator spectrometer ) data are also used in the analyses below ( see tab .  [ obs_tab ] ) ; these data cover the 1.310  kev ( mecs ) and 0.54.5  kev ( lecs ) energy bands . to extend the spectral range of our analyses to higher photon energies , which is useful to constrain the underlying power - law continuum , we furthermore used the  pds ( phoswich detection system ) data in the energy range 18120  kev .",
    "we checked for contamination of the pds data due to other x - ray sources within its field of view ( @xmath24 fwhm ) .",
    "no strong x - ray source other than mrk  6 is found within the @xmath25-diameter epic field of view in high - energy ( @xmath26  kev ) images .",
    "the  all - sky survey broad - band source catalog shows only two other x - ray sources ( ngc  2256 and ngc  2258 ) located within the pds field of view at large off - axis angles ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "both of these sources have 210  kev mecs fluxes much lower ( only @xmath5@xmath29 ) than that of mrk  6 .",
    "since the pds effective area decreases sharply with increasing off - axis angle , their contamination to the mrk  6 pds spectrum is negligible .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using xspec v11.2 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "all errors are quoted at the @xmath30 level of confidence for one parameter of interest ( @xmath31 ; avni 1976 ) and galactic absorption ( @xmath32 ; stark et al .",
    "1992 ) is always implicitly included .",
    "the previous  observation has shown that mrk  6 is an intrinsically absorbed system ( @xmath33@xmath34 ; f99 ) .",
    "we therefore used the 18120  kev  pds data , which should be much less affected by absorption , to determine the shape of the underlying x - ray continuum . fitting a power - law model to the pds data ( model  1 in tab .",
    "[ spec_tab ] ) gives a best - fit photon index of @xmath0 and an unabsorbed 20100  kev flux of @xmath35 .",
    "we then fitted the  and  pds spectra simultaneously . due to uncertainties in the cross - calibration of the instruments ( p - n and mos : @xmath36 ; snowden 2002 ) as well as possible variability between the  and  observations , we left all normalizations for the spectral components free .",
    "all other spectral parameters were tied together .",
    "we first tried fitting a power - law model with simple ( fully covering ) intrinsic absorption .",
    "such absorption could arise in the host galaxy , perhaps in gas associated with the irregularly distributed dust seen in the  image of malkan , gorjian , & tam ( 1998 ) .",
    "it could also arise on smaller scales in the nuclear region .",
    "this model is statistically rejected ( @xmath37 ; @xmath38 ) .",
    "it also gives a photon index ( @xmath39 ) well below that derived from our  pds analysis and expected intrinsically for a seyfert galaxy ( @xmath40@xmath41 ; e.g. , nandra et  al .  1997 ; risaliti 2002 ) .",
    "we next tried fitting a power - law model with a single partial - covering absorption component . partially covering",
    "absorption could arise from electron scattering of x - rays in the nucleus of mrk  6 ( see f99 ) , and such absorption has been used successfully to explain the x - ray spectra of other intermediate seyferts .",
    "this model also includes the simple intrinsic absorption used in the previous model , since again there could be absorption in the host galaxy after the x - rays have escaped the nucleus ( this simple intrinsic absorption will be implicitly included in all of the following spectral fits ) .",
    "finally , we added a gaussian emission line to model fe  k@xmath2 emission visible in the spectrum .",
    "this model is marginally acceptable ( @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ) although it leaves clear systematic residuals below @xmath5  kev and above @xmath44  kev .",
    "furthermore , like the previous model , it requires an implausibly low photon index of @xmath45 .",
    "if we constrain the photon index to lie in the range 1.62.2 , the fit is statistically unacceptable .    given the failures of the two previous spectral models , we tried a model consisting of a power law and two partially covering absorbers ( model  2 in tab .  [ spec_tab ] ) .",
    "this model was successfully used by f99 to describe the  data , and double partial covering could arise if electron scattering of x - rays provides several lines of sight into the nucleus .",
    "the photon index was fixed to the best - fit value derived from the  pds data ( @xmath46 ; our results are not changed materially if the photon index is left as a free parameter ) , and we also included a gaussian fe  k@xmath2 emission line . despite some small systematic residuals below @xmath47  kev , a good overall fit to the  and  data is found ( @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ; see fig .  [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "the absorption includes a high column density ( @xmath50 ) component covering @xmath51 of the emitting region , as well as a lower column density ( @xmath52 ) component with a higher covering percentage of ( @xmath53 . the best - fit rest - frame energy of the fe  k@xmath2 line is @xmath3  kev with an equivalent width of @xmath4  ev .",
    "there is no clear evidence for a broad fe  k@xmath2 line , and the fitted line properties are consistent with those from .",
    "given its properties , the observed line could originate via reprocessing in the outer part of the accretion disk ( e.g. , george & fabian 1991 ) or perhaps in broad line region clouds ( see equation  5 in eracleous , halpern , & livio 1996 ) .",
    "the fe  k@xmath2 line is fairly weak for a seyfert galaxy , suggesting that compton reflection is unlikely to make a dominant contribution to the x - ray spectrum . to examine any effects of compton reflection further , we replaced the simple power law in the previous fit with a power law plus neutral reflection ( the ` pexrav ' model in xspec assuming solar abundances ) .",
    "all other aspects of the model were unchanged .",
    "we obtain a relative reflection fraction ( defined as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the angle subtended by the reflector ) of @xmath56 , an inclination angle of cos  @xmath57 , and a cut - off energy of @xmath58  kev ( model  3 in tab .",
    "[ spec_tab ] ) . the fit quality",
    "is slightly improved compared to the previous fit ( @xmath59 ; @xmath60 ) , but there is no material change in the nature of the partially covering absorption . due to both statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with this model ,",
    "we do not consider the derived inclination angle to have clear physical significance .",
    "we also tested a model which assumes that the nuclear x - ray emission is attenuated by both partially ionized and neutral material , dispersed along the line of sight .",
    "this model was proposed by schurch & warwick ( 2002 ) to characterize the complex x - ray absorption of ngc  4151 , a seyfert with many similarities to mrk  6 ( see  1 ) .",
    "although the model gives a relatively good fit to the 2120  kev data , large residuals are visible below @xmath5  kev ( @xmath61 ; @xmath62 ; see fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "we obtain an ionization parameter of @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 the source ionizing luminosity in the 0.013613.6  kev band , @xmath65 the number of hydrogen atoms / ions per @xmath66 , and @xmath67 the distance from the central source to the photoionized region ) , an ionized column density of @xmath68 , and a neutral column density of @xmath69",
    ".    a slightly better fit ( @xmath70 ; @xmath71 ) is obtained if the simple power law in the previous fit is replaced with a power law plus neutral reflection ( model  4 in tab .",
    "[ spec_tab ] ) . as for the double partial - covering model ,",
    "the reflection is not a dominant spectral component and the best - fit absorption parameters do not change materially .",
    "we performed several additional fits to check the general robustness of our results .",
    "models with no intrinsic absorption and compton reflection can not provide acceptable fits .",
    "models with fully covering intrinsic absorption and compton reflection can at best provide marginally acceptable fits .",
    "these models also suffer from physical consistency problems since the energy region near the fe  k@xmath2 line is dominated by the reflection component .",
    "an fe  k@xmath2 line with a large equivalent width of @xmath72@xmath73  kev is then expected ( e.g. , matt , brandt , & fabian 1996 ) but not observed .    using the double partial - covering model ( model  2 in tab .",
    "[ spec_tab ] ) , we derive observed 0.32  kev and 210  kev  fluxes of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with those in",
    " 2.3.5 of f99 , given statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the absorption - corrected 210  kev flux and luminosity are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the absorption - corrected 0.32  kev flux and luminosity are less certain due to the large required absorption correction ; likely values are @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively . using the partially ionized and neutral absorption model ( model  4 in tab .",
    "[ spec_tab ] ) , we derive an absorption - corrected 210  kev flux and luminosity @xmath80 lower than from the double partial - covering model .      after fitting constant models to light curves and inspecting the residuals , we do not find any rapid , large - amplitude x - ray variability during the  or  observations . while constant - model fits are statistically inconsistent with the  p - n ,  mecs , and  lecs light curves , there are no strong , systematic variations about these fits ( the poor fit quality appears to be due to stochastic small - amplitude variability only slightly larger than the statistical noise ) .",
    "we can constrain the amplitude of any systematic variability to be @xmath81 for the",
    "p - n , @xmath82 for the  mecs , and @xmath83 for the  lecs . within the individual observations ,",
    "no evidence for spectral variability is found upon analysis of hardness ratios ( e.g. , 212  kev to 0.32  kev ) computed as a function of time .",
    "no variability was seen in the  data ( f99 ) , consistent with our results here .",
    "we have checked for inter - observation spectral variations via joint spectral fitting . a joint spectral analysis of the  and  data gives a fit with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "] this joint fit is statistically acceptable , indicating that we can not prove spectral variability between the  and  observations .",
    "if we use the  and  data , however , we obtain @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "this joint fit can be rejected with @xmath88% confidence , indicating spectral variability .",
    "simultaneous  and observations of the seyfert  1 galaxies ngc  5548 ( pounds et al .",
    "2003 ) and ic  4329a ( gondoin et al .",
    "2001 ) have shown that excellent fits can be found in joint spectral analyses , ruling out major cross - calibration errors .",
    "the spectral differences between the   and  data of mrk  6 are largest below @xmath89  kev where absorption dominates the spectral shape ( see fig .",
    "[ spectrum_sax ] ) , so absorption variability seems a likely explanation .",
    "we therefore analyzed the  data ( mecs , lecs and pds ) individually , which gives best - fit column densities a factor of @xmath47 smaller compared to  ( @xmath90 ; @xmath91 ) and covering fractions which are consistent with our  results [ @xmath92 ; @xmath93 .",
    "the observed and  fluxes are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "these values are significantly higher than during the  observation .",
    "the absorption - corrected 210  kev flux and luminosity are @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "the 210  kev luminosity of mrk  6 during the  observation was @xmath98% higher than during the  observation .",
    "the analyses above have substantially tightened the constraints upon the x - ray absorption and emission properties of mrk  6 .",
    "the  spectrum has @xmath99 times as many counts and a wider bandpass than the earlier  spectrum , and the 18120  kev  pds data have provided the first reliable determination of the underlying x - ray continuum shape ( a critical quantity for modeling of the x - ray absorption ) .",
    "the absorption measured in the new data can be fit acceptably with the same basic double partial - covering model used to fit the   data ( f99 ) , providing substantially improved support for the applicability of this model to mrk  6 .",
    "the measured column densities are large with @xmath100 up to @xmath101  @xmath102 , so absorption controls the shape of the x - ray spectrum up to @xmath103  kev .",
    "as discussed in  4.2.1 of f99 , the absorption seen in x - rays is substantially larger than expected from the optical reddening ; the x - ray absorbing material may be dust poor .",
    "the small 0.31  kev residuals left by the double partial - covering model may be due to @xmath104  ergs  s@xmath105 emission from ionized gas in the nucleus or host galaxy . these residuals are consistent with x - ray emission from the narrow line region , similar to that observed in ngc 4151 ( ogle et al .",
    "2000 ) and the seyfert 2 galaxies ngc 1068 ( ogle et al .  2003 ) and mrk 3 ( sako et al .",
    "the residuals around 0.80.9  kev could be fe  l emission , but this spectral complexity is difficult to model due to the limited low - energy photon statistics of the epic instruments and the insufficient signal - to - noise ratio of the rgs spectra .",
    "motivated by recent studies of ngc  4151 ( schurch & warwick 2002 ) , we also tried fitting the measured x - ray absorption with another physically plausible model consisting of both ionized and neutral columns of gas .",
    "this model provides an acceptable fit to the x - ray spectrum above 2  kev , but it leaves substantially larger residuals at lower energies than does the double partial - covering model ( visible in the lower panel of fig .  [ spectrum ] ) . again these residuals may be plausibly explained by emission from ionized gas in the nucleus or host galaxy .",
    "three pieces of evidence suggest that , at least at high energies , our x - ray observations have penetrated all the way to the black hole region of mrk  6 : ( 1 ) the 18120  kev continuum shape measured by the  pds is consistent with those of seyfert  1 galaxies ( compare with  3.2 of malaguti et  al .",
    "1999 ) , ( 2 ) the relatively small equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath2 line ( @xmath106  ev ) indicates significant dilution of the reflection continuum at 6.4  kev by direct power - law emission from the black hole region , and ( 3 ) the relative 210  kev , [ o  iii ] , and far - infrared luminosities are consistent with those of seyfert  1 galaxies ( see  4.1 of f99 ) .",
    "given these results , we can have confidence that the 210  kev ( @xmath107 from ) and 20100  kev ( @xmath108 from ) luminosities we have found for mrk  6 represent those of the intrinsic x - ray continuum ( rather than just scattered x - ray emission , for example ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of mrk  6 is @xmath109 times the average x - ray luminosity of ngc  4151 ( @xmath110 ; @xmath111 ; yang et  al .",
    "2001 ; schurch & warwick 2002 ; schurch 2002 ) .",
    "its lower x - ray flux arises only because it is @xmath112 times more distant .",
    "our analyses have also revealed significant x - ray absorption variability during the 1.5  yr between the  and  observations . in the double partial - covering model ,",
    "the column densities of both partial covering components drop by a factor of @xmath5 while the covering fractions do not change significantly .",
    "if the fitted partial covering in fact indicates that we have both direct , absorbed as well as electron - scattered , unabsorbed views of the nucleus , the observed changes seem physically plausible .",
    "the column densities along the direct line of sight could change due to gas motions in the torus atmosphere , while the scattered fraction would not change if scattering occurs on large spatial scales .",
    "the mechanism of absorption variability must allow the column density to undergo large fractional changes ; such changes could perhaps arise due to bulk rotation of a torus or poisson fluctuations in a relatively small number of obscuring ` clouds ' along the line of sight .",
    "our discovery of x - ray absorption variability from mrk  6 ( as well as the observed variability amplitude and timescale ) is generally consistent with the absorption variability seen from other absorbed seyferts ( e.g. , risaliti , elvis , & nicastro 2002 ; schurch & warwick 2002 ) .",
    "based on our results , further monitoring of the x - ray absorption variability of mrk  6 is merited to refine understanding of its amplitude and timescale .",
    "such monitoring could be significantly complemented by coordinated optical spectroscopy , given the known optical line profile variability ( see  1 ) .",
    "high - quality ultraviolet spectroscopy of mrk  6 would allow connections to be made between the x - ray absorption and any ultraviolet absorption .",
    "the archival _ iue _ data on mrk  6 suggest intrinsic mg  ii absorption , but higher quality data are required for a proper study .",
