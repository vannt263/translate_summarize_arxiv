    "the lense - thirring ( lt ) precession@xcite is a important phenomena in general relativity as well as in relativistic astrophysics . in this",
    "phenomena the locally inertial frames are dragged along the rotating spacetime due to the angular momentum of the stationary spacetime .",
    "lt precession rate is proportional to the curvature as well as the angular velocity of the rotating spacetime .",
    "thus , the effect will be larger for massive and rapidly rotating spacetime around which the curvature effect is maximum .",
    "it is perhaps majumdar and myself @xcite first to motivate investigation on the lt precession in strong gravity situation . without making any preliminary assumption",
    "we have derived the exact lt precession rate of a gyroscope in the kerr and kerr - taub - nut ( ktn ) spacetimes .",
    "now , it can easily be obtained the frame - dragging rate of a gyroscope@xcite just outside a kerr spacetime@xcite as well as a ktn spacetime@xcite .",
    "kerr and ktn spacetimes both are the vacuum solutions of einstein equation .",
    "kerr spacetime has two parameters : mass and kerr parameter ( angular momentum per unit mass ) but there are three parameters to describe the ktn spacetime .",
    "the parameters are : mass , kerr parameter and nut parameter .",
    "if the nut parameter vanishes the ktn spacetime reduces to the kerr spacetime and if the kerr parameter vanishes the ktn spacetime reduces to the taub - nut spacetime . in the absence of the nut parameter",
    ", the taub - nut spacetime reduces to pure schwarzschild spacetime which is non - rotating .",
    "the kerr spacetime is very well known to us and it is also physically reliable .",
    "we can describe the exterior geometry of many rotating astrophysical objects by the kerr spacetime only in the approximation when the multipole momenta of the rotating matter are negligible . otherwise , the metric receives corrections from higher gravitational multipole moments @xcite .",
    "thus , in the general sense the kerr spacetime is astrophysically relevant but the ktn spacetime is quite different than the kerr geometry . as it holds an additional parameter ( nut ) , this spacetime does not physically relevant till now .",
    "lynden - bell and nouri - zonoz @xcite are the first to motivate investigation on the observational possibilities for nut charges or ( gravito)magnetic monopoles .",
    "they have claimed that the signatures of such spacetime might be found in the spectra of supernovae , quasars , or active galactic nuclei .",
    "it has also been recently brought into focus by kagramanova et .",
    "al @xcite by a detail and careful analysis of geodesics in the taub - nut spacetime .",
    "a rigorous analysis in extremal and non - extremal ktn spacetimes for timelike and spacelike geodesics has already been done by myself @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the ( gravito)magnetic monopole spacetime with angular momentum ( basically the ktn spacetime ) admits relativistic thin accretion disks of a black hole in a galaxy or quasars @xcite .",
    "the accretion disks are basically formed just near the above mentioned astrophysical objects . in this sense",
    "the accretion phenomena takes place in a very strong gravity regime where the frame - dragging effect is expected to be very high .",
    "thus the frame - dragging effect should have greater impact on accretion disk phenomena .",
    "this provides us a strong motivation for studying the lt precession or frame - dragging effect in the ktn spacetime in more detail because it will affect the accretion in such spacetimes from massive stars , and might offer novel observational prospects .",
    "the ktn spacetime is a stationary and axisymmetric vacuum solution of einstein equation .",
    "this spacetime consists of the kerr and nut parameters .",
    "the kerr parameter is responsible for the rotation of the spacetime . in general sense",
    "the nut charge should not be responsible explicitly for the rotation of the spacetime but implicitly this nut charge can add a `` rotational sense '' in a non - rotating spacetime .",
    "the nut charge is also called as ` dual mass ' whose properties have been investigated in detail by ramaswamy and sen @xcite .",
    "they also called the nut parameter as the `` angular momentum monopole '' @xcite which is quite sound in this sense that it can give a `` rotational sense '' of the taub - nut spacetime even when the kerr parameter vanishes . in this",
    "regards , though the kerr parameter vanishes in the ktn spacetime , the taub - nut spacetime retains the rotational sense due to the nut parameter . due to",
    "the presence of the nut parameter the spacetime still remains stationary and violates the time reflection symmetry .",
    "time reflection changes the direction of rotation and thus does not restore one to the original configuration @xcite .",
    "thus , the failure of the hypersurface orthogonality ( it also means that the spacetime preserves the time translation symmetry but violates the time reflection symmetry ) condition implies that the neighbouring orbits of @xmath4 ( the timelike killing vector which must exist in any stationary spacetime ) `` twist '' around each other . in the kerr spacetime",
    ", the presence of the kerr parameter makes the spacetime stationary instead of static .",
    "similarly , in the case of the taub - nut spacetime the nut parameter compels the spacetime stationary instead of static .",
    "thus , the kerr and nut parameters both are responsible to make the spacetime in rotation .",
    "thus , it is needless to say that the ktn spacetime must be stationary .",
    "the strong gravity lt precession in ktn spacetime has already been highlighted in @xcite by majumdar and myself but we could not studied it in detail .",
    "though our target was to investigate lt precession in kerr and ktn spacetimes , it had taken a turn into the investigation of lt precession in taub - nut spacetime which was really very interesting in that situation .",
    "we were busy to shown that the lt precession could not vanish even in _ non - rotating _",
    "( as kerr parameter vanishes ) taub - nut spacetime . later",
    ", modak , bandyopadhyay and myself @xcite have discovered that frame - dragging curves are not smooth along the equator and its surroundings inside a rotating neutron star .",
    "rather , the frame - dragging effect shows an interesting _ anomaly _ along the equator inside the pulsars .",
    "the frame - dragging rate is maximum at the center and decreases initially away from the center , tends to zero ( not exactly zero but very small ) before the surface of the neutron star , rises again and finally approaches small value on the surface as well as outside of the pulsars .",
    "we think that this may not be the only case where we see this _ anomaly_. after that we start to hunt for this type of feature in other spacetimes which are the vacuum solutions of einstein equation and we get the almost similar _ anomaly _ in the ktn spacetime ( we note that there are many differences between the ktn spacetime and the spacetime of a rotating neutron star ; they are not same ) .",
    "previously , the strong gravity lt precession in plebaski - demiaski ( pd ) spacetimes ( most general axisymmetric and stationary spacetime till now ) has been investigated by pradhan and myself @xcite .",
    "but our close observation says that due to the presence of the nut charge this anomaly in the frame - dragging can also arise in the pd spacetime . in this present paper , we are now investigating only for lt precession in ktn spacetime as it may be astrophysically sound in near future .",
    "the paper is organized accordingly as follows : in section 2 , we review the lt precession in ktn spacetime .",
    "we also discuss a very special case of the ktn spacetime in a subsection of the section 2 .",
    "we discuss our result in section 3 and finally , we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the ktn spacetime is a geometrically stationary and axisymmetric vacuum solution of einstein equation .",
    "this spacetime consists mainly three parameters : mass @xmath5 , angular momentum @xmath6 per unit mass or kerr parameter @xmath7 and nut charge @xmath8 or dual mass .",
    "the metric of the ktn spacetime can be written as @xcite @xmath9 with @xmath10    the exact lt precession rate in the ktn spacetime is ( eq.(20 ) of @xcite ) @xmath11\\hat{r } + { \\frac}{a \\sin\\th}{p } \\left[{\\frac}{r - m}{\\rho^2 - 2mr - n^2 } -{\\frac}{r}{p^2}\\right]\\hat{\\th } \\label{kt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath12 .",

    "the lt precession rate along the pole is very high just outside the ergosphere and falls sharply and becomes zero , rises again and finally approaches to a small value after crossing the very strong gravity regime .",
    "we will now discuss an interesting situation in which the kerr parameter @xmath19 is equal to the nut parameter @xmath20 .",
    "+ * special case @xmath21 : * the horizons of the ktn spacetime are located at @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "there are two special cases in ktn spacetimes for which @xmath19 can take the value @xmath27 only and for the second case @xmath19 can take the value @xmath20 .",
    "for the first case the angular momentum of the ktn spacetime would be @xmath29 which is similar to the case of extremal kerr spacetime . in this case",

    "<S> exact lense - thirring ( lt ) precession in kerr - taub - nut spacetime is reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the lt precession does not obey the general inverse cube law of distance at strong gravity regime in kerr - taub - nut spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> rather , it becomes maximum just near the horizon , falls sharply and becomes zero near the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the precession rate increases again and after that it falls obeying the general inverse cube law of distance . </S>",
    "<S> this anomaly is maximum at the polar region of this spacetime and it vanishes after crossing a certain ` critical ' angle towards equator from pole . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight that this particular ` anomaly ' also arises in the lt effect at the interior spacetime of the pulsars and such a signature could be used to identify a role of taub - nut solutions in the astrophysical observations or equivalently , a signature of the existence of nut charge in the pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that if the kerr - taub - nut spacetime rotates with the angular momentum @xmath0 ( mass@xmath1dual mass ) , inner horizon goes to at @xmath2 and only _ event horizon _ exists at the distance @xmath3 .    </S>",
