    "quantum confinement of carriers in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) leads to numerous effects of fundamental character .",

    "the research is driven by both scientific curiosity and novel applications e.g. in optical quantum devices based on single photon emission @xcite .",
    "such photoluminescence relies on cascade process with a spectrally distributed multiexcitonic emissions and recombination of a single exciton as a final step of the sequence .",
    "although the single photon emission has been observed in several physical systems , its qds - realization promises an easy incorporation in optoelectronic semiconductor devices .",
    "the single photon emission in qds has been shown in several systems including e.g. inas / gaas self - assembled qds @xcite , cdse / zn(s , se ) @xcite , cdte / znte qds @xcite and _ naturally _ occurring qds with confinement resulting from monolayer width fluctuations of a thin gaas / gaalas @xcite quantum well . in this work",
    "we investigate a potential of _ natural _ qds present in a wetting layer ( wlqds ) , which accompanies inas / gaas self - assembled qds @xcite as single photon emitters .",
    "we report on correlation spectroscopy of excitonic complexes confined in the dots",
    ". experimental evidence of the radiative cascade between the biexcitonic and excitonic emission in the wlqds is presented .",
    "charged exciton - neutral exciton cross - correlation experiments confirm attribution of the excitons to the same wlqd .",
    "radiative lifetimes of the excitons have been measured and found to be of the same order as values usually observed in inas / gaas self - assembled qds .",

    "the sample investigated in this work was grown by molecular beam epitaxy using in - flush technique @xcite .",
    "it contains a single layer of inas qds grown at 524 @xmath2c , deposited on gaas substrate covered by 800 nm gaas buffer layer .",
    "the sample was capped with 100 nm gaas top layer .",
    "indium - flush was applied to the qds at 5 nm .    ,",
    "width=321 ]    the samples were investigated in a @xmath1pl setup presented schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) .",
    "all measurements were performed at low temperature with the sample immersed in superfluid helium ( @xmath3k ) inside an oxford spectromag bath cryostat .",
    "the cryostat was equipped with superconducting coils producing magnetic field up to 7 t either in faraday or voigt configuration .",
    "high spatial resolution was assured in the experiment by using specially design reflection - type microscope objective@xcite immersed together with the sample inside the cryostat .",
    "the diameter of the laser spot on the sample surface was below 1@xmath1 m .",
    "three different lasers were employed to excite the sample : non - resonant cw nd : yag ( 532 nm ) and led laser ( 650 nm ) or quasi - resonant femtosecond oscillator tuned at central wavelength of 760 nm .",
    "the photoluminescence was resolved using a 0.5 m diffraction spectrometer with a ccd camera and an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) for ultra - fast single photon detection .",
    "two different time - resolved techniques were used .",
    "measurements of radiative lifetime were carried out using a low jitter apd ( idquantique id50 ) .",
    "the overall temporal resolution in this measurement was up to 40 ps .",
    "the other time - resolved technique used in our experiment was a single - photon correlation measurement . in this case",
    "two independent monochromators with high efficiency perkin - elmer apds were used .",
    "the monochromators were tuned to pass photons from a single excitonic transition , set independently for each spectrometer .",
    "the setup was arranged in hanbury - brown  twiss@xcite configuration with a 50/50 non - polarizing beamsplitter .",
    "signals from the apds were recorded using multichannel picosecond event timer hydraharp400 .",
    "the timer was started by a photon detection in one apd and stopped by a photon detection in the other apd .",
    "a histogram of the events was built as a function of time delay between detection of two photons .",
    "total temporal resolution of the setup was estimated as 1.1 ns .",
    "accumulation time of a single correlation histogram was up to several hours , depending on the intensity of investigated emission lines .",
    "pl spectrum from the structure with wlqds .",
    "( b - c ) spatial mapping of pl intensity monitored at ( b ) 1412 mev and ( c ) 1417 mev .",
    "the range of the presented maps was equal to 20@xmath420 @xmath1m@xmath5 [ fig : pl ] ]    the pl spectrum from the investigated structure consists of the emission related to the gaas barrier ( 1.49 ev ) , self - assembled qds@xcite ( 1.251.30 ev ) , and the emission related to the wl ( 1.421.44 ev ) .",
    "the @xmath1pl spectrum in the energy range of the expected wl - emission consists of a broad peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pl](a ) ) with well - resolved sharp line structure .",
    "this pl has been attributed to recombination of electrons and heavy holes in the wl observed in similar qds systems @xcite .",
    "the structure of the peak shows that the wl is strongly disordered due to composition and strain fluctuations .",
    "the disorder leads to potential fluctuations , which localize excitons . at some spots on the sample",
    "several well - resolved lines emerge in the spectrum at lower ( by up to 10 mev ) energies .",
    "we attribute these emission lines from the low - energy tail of the wl - related band as being related to recombination of excitons in the wlqds .    in order to provide more comprehensive characterization of the wlqd emission we analyzed pl properties of several different dots .",
    "all of them were characterized by relatively low emission energy , which was necessary to resolve the qd signal from the much stronger wl emission .",
    "we found that different dots shared the same pl pattern , including the same spectral order and similar spacing between various pl lines .",
    "typical spectrum of a single wlqd is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : micropl](a ) .",
    "intensities of various pl lines present in the spectrum depend on parameters of excitation . with a weak pulsed excitation ( i.e. far from saturation of the qd emission ) at 760 nm ( 1.63 ev ) the pl spectrum features two main emission lines related to a neutral exciton ( x ) and charged exciton ( cx@xmath6 ) recombination .",
    "under stronger excitation additional lines emerge : a line related to a neutral biexciton ( xx ) and a few other weaker lines denoted for the sake of present study as l1 and l2 .",
    "detailed identification of these transitions is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "the identification of transitions x , xx , cx@xmath6 , cx@xmath7 is firmly supported by measurements of polarization - resolved pl and magnetophotoluminescence . in the former case we recorded pl spectra while changing the orientation of detected linear polarization . by fitting gaussian profiles to the analyzed spectral lines we extracted apparent energies of each transition .",
    "the energies of x and xx transitions exhibited clear sine - like oscillations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ident](a ) ) evidencing a splitting into two linearly polarized components@xcite not resolved within our experimental resolution .",
    "the splitting is related to anisotropic exchange electron - hole interaction , which is characteristic of neutral excitons in qds@xcite .",
    "the splitting pattern allows to attribute the x and xx emission lines to the neutral exciton and biexciton respectively . the value of anisotropic splitting for the dot presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ident](a ) yielded @xmath8 @xmath1ev .",
    "the relatively low anisotropy of the neutral exciton is similar to the values found in natural qds formed by interface fluctuations in thin quantum wells @xcite .    , width=321 ]    another important parameter of the excitation was the wavelength of the laser line . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : micropl ] wlqd emission can be strongly affected by this parameter , plausibly due to charge redistribution induced by higher - energy excitation , e.g. at 650 nm ( 1.91 ev ) .",
    "data in the figure were obtained with relatively weak excitation of higher energy  100 times lower than simultaneous low - energy excitation  evidencing the sensitivity of the pl spectrum to the induced charge redistribution .",
    "the main observed change is quenching of a charged exciton line cx@xmath6 accompanied with emerging of another line recognized as a charged exciton of the opposite sign cx@xmath7 .",
    "plots in the right - hand side panels present splitting pattern of ( b ) cx@xmath6 and ( c ) cx@xmath7 transition in magnetic field ( voigt configuration ) measured for another dot .",
    "black and red ( grey ) curves correspond to two perpendicular linear polarizations .",
    "[ fig : ident],width=321 ]    no effect of in - plane anisotropy was detected for lines cx@xmath6 and cx@xmath7 , which confirms their attribution to charged excitons .",
    "observation of both the neutral and the charged excitons is usually reported in spectroscopic studies of nonresonantly excited qds @xcite further confirmation of the charged - exciton lines identification was provided by measurements of pl in the magnetic field in voigt configuration ( fig . [ fig : ident](b - c ) ) . in such a configuration , a splitting into four components is expected for charged exciton transition as opposed to two bright components for the neutral exciton @xcite .",
    "our spectroscopic data confirm such a prediction for both cx@xmath6 and cx@xmath7 transitions ( fig.[fig : ident](b ) and fig.[fig : ident](c ) respectively ) . in both cases we observe symmetrical splitting into two pairs of lines linearly polarized along or perpendicularly to the field direction .",
    "the splitting of the inner doublet at 7 t is observable only as an increase in the linewidth while the splitting of the outer doublet is more pronounced ( 0.29 mev at 7 t as shown in fig .",

    "line , ( c ) cx@xmath7 line , and ( d ) xx line .",
    "solid lines demonstrate fits of single exponential decays convolved with the response function of the detection setup .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes ] ]    in order to verify feasibility of using wlqds as non - classical light emitters we investigated dynamical properties of wlqd pl by measurements of time - resolved photoluminescence and single photon correlations .    the results of the measurements revealed sub - nanosecond life - times of the excitons confined in the wlqds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes ] ) . for single excitons we found life - times of 0.57 to 0.85 ns depending on the charge state .",
    "the neutral biexciton xx line exhibited shorter life - time of 0.39 ns .",
    "measured life - times are two times shorter than life - time measured for an array of self - assembled inas / gaas qds in the same sample which yields about 1.6 ns@xcite .",
    "short life - time of the wlqds may be related to the weak lateral confinement@xcite .",
    "effective carrier recombination in the wlqds may have important implications for the dynamics of carrier trapping in self - assembled qds in optoelectronic structures .",
    "trapping electrons and holes in the wlqds may influence lateral carrier transport in the wl @xcite . a decreased efficiency of qds feeding with carriers may affect performance of optoelectronic devices .",
    "moreover , a possible in - plane energy transfer to lower energy dots@xcite would also have detrimental effect on devices based on self - assembled dots due to uncontrolled re - excitation from wlqd system .",
    "line , ( c ) crosscorrelation x - cx@xmath7 , and ( d ) crosscorrelation x - xx .",
    "cross - correlation between x and cx@xmath7 lines was measured with additional weak cw illumination . [",
    "fig : correlations ] ]    the ultimate demonstration of the qds single - photon emission was provided by means of single - photon correlation measurements .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] presents a set of correlation results as histograms of number of detected photon pairs of given temporal separation .",
    "all measured histograms consist of distinct peaks separated by laser repetition period of 13.2 ns .",
    "the width of each peak is governed by the relaxation time addressed in time resolved pl measurements and the temporal resolution of the setup .",
    "autocorrelation of the x line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] exhibits well pronounced suppression of a central ( @xmath9 ) peak related to a photon antibunching effect .",
    "the relative height of the central peak amounted to second order correlation parameter of @xmath10 .",
    "comparison of obtained @xmath11 parameter with its threshold value of 0.5 @xcite unequivocally proves the single - photon character of light emitted due to excitonic recombination in the studied wlqd .",
    "we exploited two independent monochromators in the hanbury - brown  twiss configuration to measure also cross - correlations between different lines of a single wlqd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations](b - d ) ) .",
    "strong correlation evidenced as increase or decrease of the intensity of the central peak confirmed our previous attribution of pl lines to the same single wlqd .",
    "each cross - correlation histogram reflects the relation between correlated transitions .",
    "specifically , in the case of cross - correlations between neutral and charged excitons we observed an antibunching effect comparable to the x - x autocorrelation discussed previously",
    ". a faint asymmetry of a side peak height may be related to processes of a single carrier capture @xcite , however low signal intensity did not allow us to elaborate on this effect .",
    "an interesting effect was observed for x - cx@xmath7 cross - correlation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations](c ) ) , which was measured using weak above - barrier illumination to increase the intensity of cx@xmath7 line .",
    "the mixed excitation regime ( pulsed excitation + cw illumination ) was reflected in correlation histogram , which featured both well - pronounced peaks at laser repetition period and recognizable cw background .",
    "the height of the peaks exhibited similar asymmetry to the one observed in case of x - cx@xmath6 correlation and attributed to the single carrier capture mechanism@xcite .",
    "a similar effect was observed also for the cw component of the correlation histogram .",
    "the photon count in the range between the central peak and the consecutive one was found much smaller then in the other sections of the histogram .",
    "the difference is easily interpreted in terms of the single carrier mechanism invoked earlier .",
    "directly after the recombination of the neutral exciton the dot is empty and the emission of the charged exciton require capturing of the three carriers .",
    "such a process is unlikely to occur using only the weak illumination .",
    "conversely , the next laser pulse can excite the dot to the dark exciton state and thus increase the probability of the creation of charged exciton by the illumination during the next inter - pulse period .",
    "the difference between these two scenarios ( 3 carrier vs 1 carrier capture ) accounts for the discussed effect in the correlation histogram .",
    "finally , we also demonstrated a cascade - type cross - correlation between xx and x lines , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations](d ) . in this case",
    "the central peak was more pronounced than the average peak by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "obtained value well corresponds to relatively strong excitation regime that was used in our experiment .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the wetting layer quantum dots coexisting with self - assembled qds can be used as a source of quantum light .",
    "we were able to determine basic properties of wlqd emission , including identification of all main pl lines .",
    "the results supporting presented identification include pl experiments with the external magnetic field and polarization - resolved pl measurements .",
    "fine structure splitting of the excitonic transition was found in range around 10@xmath1ev without any special processing of the sample .",
    "we also successfully demonstrated a variety of single photon correlations between emission lines of a single wlqd .",
    "our results unequivocally prove that observed emission lines originate from a single dot and further support their identification by asymmetry of the cross - correlation histograms .",
    "moreover , our demonstration of biexciton - exciton cascade in this system opens a possibility to pursue entangled photon pair generation from wlqds by further reduction of their in - plane anisotropy ."
