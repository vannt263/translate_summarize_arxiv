    "recent calculations of four - point scattering amplitudes in the maximally supersymmetric gravity theory of cremmer and julia  @xcite indicate the existence of novel ultraviolet cancellations at three and higher loops , which may even lead to the perturbative finiteness of the theory  @xcite .",
    "string dualities have also been used to argue for ultraviolet finiteness of @xmath0 supergravity  @xcite , though difficulties with decoupling towers of massive states may alter this conclusion  @xcite .    at one loop in the @xmath0 theory ,",
    "the corresponding novel cancellations are encapsulated in the `` no - triangle hypothesis ''  @xcite . in general , dimensionally regularized amplitudes in four dimensions can be expressed as a linear combination of scalar box , triangle and bubble integrals together with rational terms  @xcite .",
    "the no - triangle hypothesis states that all one - loop amplitudes in @xmath0 supergravity can be expressed solely in terms of scalar box integrals and that neither triangle integrals , bubble integrals nor additional rational terms appear .",
    "this hypothesis is surprising from the point of view of power counting , which  together with standard integral reduction formulas  would imply that triangle integrals should appear beginning at five points and bubble integrals at six points .",
    "the cancellation of triangle and bubble integrals were first observed in maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) amplitudes of the @xmath0 theory  @xcite .",
    "more recently , this observation was extended to the hypothesis that the same cancellations occur in _ all _ @xmath0 one - loop amplitudes , so that they are expressed solely in terms of scalar box integrals  @xcite .",
    "it has been confirmed for six - graviton amplitudes , by explicit computation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at seven points the infrared singularities have been shown to be consistent with the no - triangle hypothesis  @xcite . beyond six and seven points ,",
    "scaling and factorization properties of the amplitudes provide strong evidence that the no - triangle hypothesis holds for the remaining amplitudes in @xmath0 supergravity  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these one - loop cancellations were argued to lead to an improved ultraviolet behavior in classes of terms encountered in multi - loop calculations in the @xmath0 theory . at three loops , the improvement in the ultraviolet behavior due to these and",
    "related cancellations has been confirmed by the explicit calculation of the complete four - point scattering amplitude in the @xmath0 theory  @xcite .",
    "the consistency of the regge limit with improved ultraviolet behavior in @xmath0 supergravity has also been recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "supersymmetry , in particular , has long been studied for its ability to reduce the degree of divergence of gravity theories  @xcite .",
    "however , all superspace power counting arguments ultimately delay the onset of divergences only by a finite number of loops , depending upon assumptions regarding the types of superspaces and invariants that can be constructed .",
    "if the cancellations observed in the @xmath0 theory are only partly due to supersymmetry , then what might account for the remainder of the observed cancellations ? here",
    "we propose that _",
    "these extra cancellations are generic to any quantum gravity theory _ based on the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "these cancellations are not at all obvious in feynman diagrams which individually obey a naive power counting .",
    "rather , they will be manifest only in carefully chosen representations of the amplitudes .",
    "our proposal is that in supersymmetric theories , the supersymmetric cancellations are on top of these cancellations . at one loop when combined with the expected supersymmetric cancellations this implies that supergravity theories with @xmath2 supersymmetries should be fully `` cut constructible ''  @xcite , including rational terms , using cuts in four dimensions . for the @xmath0 theory at one loop it is again the combination of cancellations that leads to the `` no - triangle hypothesis '' .",
    "following the same line of reasoning as used in the @xmath0 theory  @xcite , suggests that the observed one - loop cancellations in non - supersymmetric pure gravity will lead to a softening of the ultraviolet behavior at higher loops .    for non - supersymmetric theories these additional cancellations",
    "are in general insufficient to render the theory ultraviolet finite . indeed ,",
    "explicit calculations show that gravity coupled to matter generically diverges at one loop  @xcite .",
    "pure einstein gravity in four dimensions possesses a cancellation at one loop , distinct from the ones being discussed here , due to the absence of a viable counterterm , delaying the divergence to two loops .",
    "this two - loop divergence was established by goroff and sagnotti through direct computation of that divergence  @xcite and later confirmed by van de ven  @xcite .    here , as a first step in checking the hypothesis that there are novel cancellations in non - supersymmetric gravity theories",
    ", we will investigate pure gravity at one loop . to carry out our investigation of cancellations we make use of the unitarity method  @xcite . in order to observe the cancellations we reduce the amplitudes to combinations of box , bubble and triangle integrals .",
    "the cancellations then manifest themselves in unexpectedly low powers of loop momentum in these integrals .",
    "the reduction to the basic integrals allows us to combine the contributions coming from the higher - point integrals to make the cancellations explicit .",
    "we do so using powerful new loop integration methods  @xcite , based on generalized unitarity  @xcite and complex momenta  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we make extensive use of the formalism introduced in ref .",
    "this will allow us to observe the hidden cancellations through simple scaling arguments .",
    "the unitarity method requires as input tree amplitudes , which we construct via kawai - lewellen - tye ( klt ) relations  @xcite and on - shell recursion relations  @xcite .",
    "for mhv tree amplitudes , we use the form obtained by berends , giele and kuijf @xcite via the klt relations .",
    "this is a particularly compact form , making apparent various useful properties of the amplitudes .",
    "the one - loop cancellations we observe rely on rather generic properties of gravity tree - level amplitudes .",
    "in particular , certain scaling properties of the tree amplitudes have to be independent of the number of scattering particles .",
    "these cancellations are quite reminiscent of ones that occur at tree level under the large complex deformations needed to prove the validity of on - shell recursion relations  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the connection of large complex deformations to the absence of scalar bubble integrals in @xmath0 supergravity has been already noted in ref .",
    "this connection suggests that the cancellations will be present in theories that are `` fully constructible '' from on - shell recursion relations , in the sense of ref .",
    "@xcite . in such theories",
    ", the tree amplitudes can be obtained using on - shell recursion using only three vertices as the input .",
    "remarkably , einstein gravity is in this class .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we review properties of gravity tree amplitudes , including the cancellations that are present under large complex deformations . then in we describe the methods we use to count the leading powers of loop momentum in the triangle and bubble integrals contributing in einstein gravity . in this section",
    "we also contrast these cancellations against the well known one which renders pure einstein gravity finite at one loop .",
    "we present the explicit power counting of the triangle and bubble integrals in . in",
    "we explain the relationship between the cancellations we observe at one loop and ones that were observed previously at tree level .",
    "we also give a heuristic explanation of observed one - loop cancellations , based on universal factorization properties of one - loop amplitudes .",
    "we conclude and comment on the outlook in .",
    "in this section , we first review some well known representations of tree amplitudes , used later for explicit computations , and then review cancellations in tree amplitudes needed for on - shell recursion relations .      to expose useful properties of scattering amplitudes in four dimensions we employ the spinor - helicity formalism  @xcite , with spinor products , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a massless weyl spinor with momentum @xmath5 and positive or negative chirality .",
    "it will also be convenient to use the bra - ket notation for the contractions of weyl spinors ; @xmath6 = 2k_j\\cdot k_l = s_{jl}$ ] .",
    "a useful identity is the schouten identity , @xmath7 valid for four arbitrary spinors @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the spinor - helicity formalism gluon ( spin @xmath10 )",
    "polarization vectors take the form , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the momentum carried by the particle and @xmath13 is a null reference momentum .",
    "the graviton polarization is , @xmath14 it is worth noting that the tracelessness condition @xmath15 is automatically enforced since @xmath16 is a complex null vector .",
    "a particularly useful representation for gravity tree amplitudes is based on the kawai , lewellen and tye relations  @xcite between open and closed string theory tree - level amplitudes , especially since this exposes the intimate connection between gauge and gravity amplitudes . in the low - energy limit",
    "these become relations between gravity and gauge theory amplitudes . not only",

    "for example ,",
    "using known expressions for the gauge theory amplitudes  @xcite , for @xmath28 the klt relations give us , @xmath29 although very useful , the klt form often makes all-@xmath19 analyses difficult due to large permutation sums and non - manifest factorization and scaling properties . for the specific case of mhv all-@xmath19 ( @xmath30 ) graviton amplitudes , berends , giele and kuijf ( bgk )  @xcite presented the more manageable expression , @xmath31 where all legs besides @xmath32 and @xmath33 are of positive helicity , and @xmath34 , and",

    "the  graviton amplitudes , which have two positive helicity graviton legs and the rest negative , are obtained simply by swapping angle with square brackets .",
    "the mhv tree amplitudes satisfy simple supersymmetry ward identities  @xcite , allowing us to replace two of the graviton legs with any pair of particles of lesser spin , @xmath39 where @xmath40 represents particle @xmath32 carrying helicity @xmath41 , while on the right hand side of this identity , we have a pure graviton tree amplitude . for gravitons",

    "this identity is rather useful , giving us a simple means of separating the cancellations due to supersymmetry from those that happen with no supersymmetry .",
    "a similar identity holds for the  amplitudes , except that angle brackets are replaced with square ones .",
    "2.0 truein    -.3 cm      one clue pointing to improved high energy behavior of gravity scattering amplitudes comes from considerations of on - shell recursion relations  @xcite for gravity amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "these recursion relations are constructed by deforming the amplitude via a complex shift of momenta .",
    "for example , we may shift two of the momenta , say those of legs @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a complex parameter . in terms of spinor variables ,",
    "the deformation ( [ shiftmomentum ] ) is equivalent to a shift of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 we will refer to this as an `` @xmath52 shift '' .",
    "the above shift maintains both momentum conservation and leaves legs @xmath45 and @xmath46 on shell , deforming the amplitude @xmath53 to become @xmath48 dependent . as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , if a shifted tree amplitude vanishes for large @xmath48 , it can be written as a sum over simple poles in @xmath48 , giving rise to an on - shell recursion relation .",
    "taking @xmath48 in large , corresponds to taking the momenta @xmath54 and @xmath55 large in a complex direction , which may be interpreted as a particular high - energy limit . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , for the case of gravity , it is not at all obvious from feynman diagrams that the shifted amplitude , @xmath56 , will in fact vanish for large @xmath48 .",
    "consider the single gravity feynman diagram displayed in , assuming we have @xmath57 vertices and thus @xmath58 propagators along the line connecting legs @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "each of these vertices scale as @xmath59 since two shift momenta appear at each vertex .",
    "the shifted propagators scale as @xmath60 , as can be easily checked using the fact that @xmath61 is null .",
    "if the shifted legs @xmath45 and @xmath46 are of negative and positive helicity respectively , the polarization tensors for these legs give factors of @xmath62 each , as can be seen by applying the shift ( [ spinorshift ] ) to .",
    "combining the various factors of @xmath48 gives us an overall scaling for the diagram of @xmath63 which for @xmath64 is badly behaved as @xmath65 . in an @xmath19-point amplitude feynman diagrams may have up to @xmath66 vertices , so the worst behaved diagrams scale as @xmath67 at large @xmath48 .",
    "this may be contrasted to the behavior of yang - mills feynman diagrams . in this case",
    ", there is at most one momentum at each vertex , leading to a large @xmath48 scaling in any diagram no worse than @xmath60 , after incorporating the behavior of the polarization vectors ( [ gluonpol ] ) of legs @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , gravity would appear to be much worse behaved at large @xmath48 than gauge theory , in line with the standard statements that gravity is badly behaved in the ultraviolet . for @xmath53 to vanish as @xmath68 there need to be hidden cancellations not apparent within individual feynman diagrams .",
    "indeed this is the case : various studies of on - shell recursion relations support this  @xcite and , more recently , benincasa , boucher - veronneau and cachazo  @xcite have given a general proof for the vanishing of @xmath19-graviton amplitudes under a @xmath69 shift , where the `` @xmath70 '' and `` @xmath71 '' labels refer to the helicities of the shifted legs in .",
    "in particular , for mhv amplitudes , supersymmetry ward identities give the scaling of mhv graviton amplitudes for generic shifts which we have collected in .",
    "this pattern has been conjectured to hold for any @xmath19-graviton tree amplitude  @xcite . by following similar reasoning as in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the @xmath69 shift , we have confirmed that under a @xmath72 shift @xmath19-graviton amplitudes behave as @xmath73 for any helicity configuration .",
    "we have also confirmed that is correct for _ all _ graviton helicity configurations through at least ten points , by numerically evaluating complex deformations of amplitudes constructed via on - shell recursion .",
    "the cases of @xmath74 and @xmath75 shift remain to be proven for @xmath76 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the power counting of the triangle integral of ( b ) is determined by the large-@xmath77 scaling of the three tree amplitudes composing the triple cut of ( b ) .",
    "for example , the contribution , where each tree amplitude has opposite helicity cut legs , is given by , @xmath78 where @xmath79 for an @xmath19-point amplitude .",
    "again , with mhv or  tree amplitudes appearing in the triple cuts , it is a simple matter to obtain the scaling pattern in from and their parity conjugates , by choosing the legs carrying loop momentum to be legs @xmath10 and @xmath19 . for all helicity configurations",
    ", we have numerically checked that the table is correct up to ten points , using the kinematics of .",
    "an all-@xmath19 proof for the particular helicity configurations @xmath80 crossing the cut will be outlined in .",
    "given the scalings in we see that no product of the three tree amplitudes in a triple cut can have worse scaling than , @xmath81 including contributions from integral reductions from higher - point integrals . again , this is significantly better than the behavior obtained from an @xmath19-gon feynman diagram which can generate triangles integrals with up to @xmath82 powers of loop momentum in their numerators .",
    "for the cases where the cuts are composed of purely mhv and amplitudes , we can easily compare to the results of @xmath0 supergravity , by making use of the supersymmetry identity  ( [ swiformhv ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "we obtain an overall scaling of @xmath83 , including any additional cancellations from supersymmetry , which means that triangle integrals are not present . as in our previous examples ,",
    "the key @xmath19-dependent cancellations are already present in the non - supersymmetric case .      in summary",
    "our checks confirm the cancellations for pure einstein gravity for all triangle and bubble contributions , when the tree amplitudes appearing the cuts used to determine the integrals are from among the following :    1 .",
    "an @xmath57-point mhv amplitude .",
    "2 .   an @xmath57-point  amplitude .",
    "3 .   any helicity configuration with up to ten gravitons .",
    "an @xmath57-point amplitude with loop - momentum helicities @xmath80 .",
    "this demonstrates that the one - loop cancellations hold through ten points in pure gravity for all helicity configurations and argues strongly that it continues to hold beyond this .",
    "one might be concerned that the results for the mhv and  amplitudes were derived using the bgk formula , which has been tested only up to 11 points .",
    "this is not a real restriction here , as the information we extract from the bgk formula is its scaling properties , which will be shown to hold for all @xmath57 by an independent line of reasoning in .    for cases with only mhv or  amplitudes in the cuts we analyzed the additional cancellations in @xmath84-extended supergravity theories by summing over the super - multiplet . when opposite helicities cross the cut , depending on whether @xmath84 is even or odd we have additional cancellations of @xmath84 or @xmath85 powers of loop momentum , respectively .",
    "in particular , for @xmath0 supergravity , the no - triangle hypothesis follows from a combination of cancellations , with at most eight powers of loop momentum in the numerator canceled by supersymmetry and the remaining cancellations already present in pure gravity .",
    "we now outline a proof , which will be presented in more detail elsewhere , that the one - loop cancellations described above are simply related to the tree - level large-@xmath48 cancellations under the shift ( [ spinorshift ] ) .",
    "we also present a heuristic argument using factorization to explain the pure gravity cancellations , similar to the one used to propose the `` no - triangle hypothesis '' for @xmath0 supergravity in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consider a generic tree amplitude , @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the helicities  for gravitons these take on the values of @xmath89 .",
    "we now observe some simple relations between the different scalings .",
    "suppose that after a @xmath90 shift ( [ shiftmomentum ] ) , and after accounting for all cancellations , we find that the tree amplitude scales in the large-@xmath48 limit as , @xmath91 where the value of @xmath57 depends upon the helicities .",
    "using , we see that the scaling of the flipped @xmath92 shift , at large @xmath48 , is related to the above by , @xmath93 similarly , consulting tables  ( [ shiftztable ] ) and ( [ twoparticlecuttable ] ) , we find that the large-@xmath94 scaling of the two - particle cut momentum parameterization  ( [ bubblecut4vector ] ) is given by , @xmath95 from tables  ( [ shiftztable ] ) and ( [ triplecuttable ] ) , we observe that under the loop - momentum parametrization for the triple cut  ( [ triplecutmomentum ] ) , @xmath96 this indicates that all the scalings are related up to universal helicity dependent factors . were these observed relations to hold on very general grounds , the non - trivial cancellations in the feynman diagrams in one of the scalings would necessarily imply non - trivial cancellations in the other scalings . in fact , this turns out to be the case , as we now argue .",
    "to establish the above scaling relations , we write the scattering amplitude ( [ generictree ] ) in an abstract form making the helicity weights manifest .",
    "the tree - level scattering amplitudes are rational functions in all spinor variables . using momentum conservation , @xmath97 , we trade momentum @xmath98 for @xmath99 , absorbing the spinor weight of the leg carrying momentum @xmath98 into factors of @xmath100 .",
    "this allows us to write an amplitude with the legs carrying the momentum @xmath99 and @xmath98 with the corresponding helicities @xmath87 and @xmath88 as @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are polynomials in spinors @xmath104 and @xmath105 , satisfying @xmath106 and we have suppressed the dependence on external momenta .",
    "the polynomials @xmath102 and @xmath107 have definite helicity weight  the number of @xmath104s minus the number of @xmath105s  denoted by subscripts @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "for the total amplitude to have proper helicity weight with respect to the @xmath104 and @xmath110 , the weights @xmath108 and @xmath109 must be related to the helicities by , @xmath111 in the scaling limits considered above , the polynomials are dominated by the highest degree monomials in the @xmath104 and @xmath105 variables , @xmath112 a priori , the values of @xmath113 and @xmath114 can be functions of the number of external legs and their helicities .",
    "this general form of the amplitude may now be probed in the various scaling limits . for the shift @xmath90 of the amplitude we have the scaling , @xmath115 where we introduced the variable @xmath116 to match . applying the @xmath77 and @xmath94 scalings to immediately gives us .",
    "similarly we obtain the flipped @xmath48-shift result ( [ flippedshift ] ) .",
    "notice that the value of @xmath57 does not follow from this analysis and has to be derived by other means .",
    "the relations between the various scalings thus hold on very general grounds and are applicable to a wide variety of cases including amplitudes with general matter content . in our analysis",
    "we assumed that the monomials in do not vanish in the scaling limits .",
    "as will be discussed elsewhere , this always holds for the scaling limits discussed here .",
    "the @xmath48-scaling for the shift @xmath69 in   has been proven rigorously for all @xmath19 in ref .",
    "@xcite . direct comparison with this",
    "then allows for an easy proof of the corresponding @xmath117 case of the @xmath94 and @xmath77 scaling . because the shift @xmath72 is the flipped version of the shift @xmath69 , the two are related by the constraints of spinor weight",
    "this then gives a proof of the large-@xmath48 scaling of the shift @xmath72 in   for all @xmath19 . in turn",
    "this can be used to prove the @xmath118 cases in and , as well .",
    "the @xmath119 and @xmath120 cases , however , remain unproven beyond ten points for non - mhv amplitudes . for mhv amplitudes , the supersymmetry identity ( [ swiformhv ] )",
    "allows us to apply the @xmath69 proof to these cases as well  @xcite .",
    "these results demonstrate that the bubble - triangle cancellations occur whenever all tree amplitudes composing a cut have loop - momentum helicity configurations @xmath80 .",
    "it also shows that if the @xmath75 and @xmath74 entries in are valid for any number of legs , the bubble - triangle cancellations also hold for any number of legs for the other helicity configurations of the cut legs .",
    "in addition , the bubble - triangle cancellations may be understood heuristically as a consequence of the stringent factorization properties of one - loop amplitudes .",
    "as any intermediate momentum @xmath121 goes on - shell ( @xmath122 ) , a one - loop amplitude factorizes into lower - point amplitudes ( along with a universal `` factorization function '' for infrared singular amplitudes  @xcite ) .",
    "as we demonstrated through ten points , for all helicities , no graviton amplitudes can have tensor triangle or bubble integrals with more than six or four powers of loop momentum in the numerators , respectively . therefore , in _ all _ factorization limits of higher - point amplitudes we can not encounter these integral functions or the results of reducing them to scalar integrals",
    ". moreover , the same type of argument holds for factorizations where two of the external momenta become collinear or where one of the external momenta becomes soft .",
    "although this does not constitute a proof that the unwanted tensor triangle and bubble integrals can not appear , we know of no counterexample , in either gravity or non - abelian gauge theory where this type of factorization bootstrap argument has failed to produce the correct result .    indeed , this argument is similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite to propose the no - triangle hypothesis for the @xmath0 theory . in that case",
    ", there were no bubble or triangle integrals at all at lower points , predicting that bubble or triangle integrals should not appear at higher points as well .",
    "in this paper we studied cancellations in pure gravity one - loop amplitudes , pointing to the existence of novel ultraviolet cancellations in generic gravity theories at higher loops . at one loop , without the novel cancellations , the two - derivative coupling of gravity would imply that under integral reductions of @xmath19-point amplitudes we naively would obtain bubble integrals with up to @xmath123 powers of loop momentum in their numerators .",
    "similarly , we would obtain triangle integrals with up to @xmath82 powers of loop momentum in their numerators .",
    "instead , under more careful scrutiny , we found that the triangle and bubble integrals resulting from integral reductions have no more than six or four powers of loop momentum , respectively .    by comparing the pure gravity case to @xmath84-extended supergravity in various examples",
    ", we disentangled the supersymmetric cancellations in these theories from the ones which are generic to gravity . assuming the universality of the gravity cancellations , one - loop @xmath124-extended supergravity amplitudes are cut - constructible  @xcite using only four - dimensional momenta in the cuts .",
    "that is , they are completely determined by their absorptive parts .",
    "similarly , the `` no - triangle hypothesis '' of the @xmath0 theory  @xcite may be thought of as a consequence of the combination of the pure gravity cancellations and supersymmetric cancellations .",
    "it is interesting to note that conventional superspace power counting is sensitive to only the latter types of cancellations .    the unitarity method , together with a new spinor - based integration method  @xcite , allows us to link directly cancellations occurring in one - loop amplitudes to cancellations in tree - level amplitudes .",
    "this follows an early version of scaling arguments , used to imply that bubble integrals should not appear in @xmath0 supergravity amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "our approach allows us to determine straightforwardly the maximum powers of loop momentum that appear in the triangle and bubble integrals , including all feed downs from integral reductions .",
    "although we have not constructed a complete proof of one - loop cancellations for all possible gravity amplitudes , we numerically demonstrated their existence up to ten points for _ all _ pure gravity helicity amplitudes , and analytically for special helicity configurations for all @xmath19 .",
    "we have also outlined a proof for all contributions to triangle and bubble integrals whose cuts are composed of tree amplitudes with opposite graviton helicities on the legs carrying loop momentum .",
    "the cancellations discussed here are connected to recently identified properties of gravity tree amplitudes . in the usual lagrangian formulation an infinite set of vertices",
    "are needed to construct the scattering amplitudes .",
    "this may be contrasted with on - shell recursion relations  @xcite which remarkably construct all gravity tree amplitudes in @xmath125 , starting _ only _ from three vertices .",
    "this property has been recently proposed as a means of classifying theories  @xcite . for the recursion relations to hold cancellations under certain large complex deformations of the amplitudes are necessary .",
    "the existence of these cancellations are rather obscure in feynman diagrams .",
    "a proof of the cancellations required to have valid on - shell recursion relations has recently been given in ref .",
    "here we showed that related cancellations exist at one loop .",
    "3.1 truein    unitarity implies lower - loop cancellations necessarily induce higher - loop cancellations .",
    "in particular , as shown in ( a ) , the cancellations in the @xmath126-point one - loop amplitude appearing in the @xmath127-particle cut of the @xmath127-loop amplitude , necessarily imply the existence of cancellations in the @xmath127-loop amplitude .",
    "moreover , as indicated in ( b ) any one - loop sub - amplitude isolated by cuts necessarily must have the cancellations found in our one - loop investigations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these cuts , together with the one - loop no - triangle hypothesis , were used to suggest that @xmath0 supergravity may be ultraviolet finite .",
    "these cancellations , as well as others not implied by the no - triangle hypothesis , were then confirmed by explicit calculation at three loops  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the results of this paper suggest that novel cancellations at higher loops should exist even in non - supersymmetric theories , though the cancellations will not be as strong as for @xmath0 supergravity .    in order to check this , it would be rather useful to carry out explicit higher - loop studies of gravity theories . of course",
    ", in pure gravity a two - loop divergence does exist  @xcite , but an open question is to determine the critical dimension in which the divergences first appear , with and without matter , as the loop order increases .",
    "it would also be helpful to translate any higher - loop cancellations into the language of effective actions .",
    "for example , for the case of @xmath0 supergravity , at three loops , 14 powers of external momenta can be extracted from the numerators of all loop momentum integrals , giving a contribution to the effective action of the generic form @xmath128 multiplied by integrals , instead of the generic form @xmath129 , which would have been obtained if additional cancellations had not been present  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath130 denotes an @xmath0 supersymmetric contraction of riemann tensors  @xcite , and @xmath131 denotes a generic space - time covariant derivative , with lorentz indices contracted appropriately .",
    "an important calculation that will help to answer the question of whether @xmath0 supergravity is finite , and to further constrain possible superspace explanations , is to evaluate the four - point four - loop @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "this would tell us whether it has the same power counting as @xmath132 super - yang - mills theory , as already established at one  @xcite , two  @xcite and three loops  @xcite .",
    "the four - loop calculation should be feasible , though non - trivial , following the same methods as used at three loops in ref .",
    "if @xmath0 supergravity can be shown to be finite , an obvious question is whether there are other such theories .",
    "the absence of bubble integrals at one loop hints at theories with @xmath133 supersymmetries as candidate ultraviolet finite theories .",
    "one may wonder whether finiteness in gravity theories is connected to the possible existence of topological string theory descriptions  @xcite .",
    "recent developments in constructing such a string for gravity may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are a number of other issues that would be interesting to explore .",
    "it would be important to complete a proof that any one - loop amplitude in any theory based on the einstein - hilbert action coupled to matter has no more than four powers of loop momentum in the numerators of bubble integrals , and no more than six powers in triangle integrals , including those generated via integral reductions . in this paper",
    "we studied only @xmath19-graviton one - loop amplitudes .",
    "moreover , we evaluated the cuts in @xmath125 where we have powerful spinor methods for generating amplitudes and for evaluating the resulting integrals .",
    "it would be useful to carry out a power counting analysis in @xmath134 dimensions .",
    "it would also be helpful to have a general one - loop analysis of the relative power counting behavior between supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric amplitudes .",
    "finally , it would be important to re - express the cancellations in terms of effective actions .    in summary , the results of this paper point to the existence of novel loop - level cancellations in generic point - like theories of quantum gravity based on the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "as we showed , these cancellation are related to previously identified tree - level cancellations in gravity amplitudes under large complex deformations  @xcite .",
    "the cancellations suggest that , in general , the perturbative ultraviolet properties of quantum gravity theories may be tamer than anticipated , pointing to an improved ultraviolet behavior in the wilsonian effective action as the cutoff is varied , independent of supersymmetry . as already suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 supergravity , the combination of these cancellations with supersymmetric ones may be sufficient to render the theory ultraviolet finite to all loop orders .",
    "further work will be required to confirm these proposals .",
