    "the aharonov - bergmann - lebowitz ( abl ) rule@xcite was proposed in 1964 to compute measurement result probabilities of systems that are both preselected and postselected .",
    "it was meant to provide a time - reversal invariant formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .    as long as a measurement",
    "is actually carried out between pre- and postselection , the abl  rule is a straightforward consequence of the born probability rule and usual assumptions on the quantum state following a measurement .",
    "attempts have been made , however , to interpret the abl  rule counterfactually , that is , to cases where no intermediate measurement is made .",
    "the resulting controversy is , i believe , partly due to the fact that proposed definitions of counterfactuals in the present quantum - mechanical context do not adequately capture the intuitive meaning of the notion .",
    "in this paper i first review the derivation of the abl  rule and some of its properties , in particular contextuality .",
    "next i analyze alleged proofs of the impossibility of interpreting the rule counterfactually , as well as various arguments supporting or opposing them .",
    "i attempt to clarify the meaning of a counterfactual interpretation , and point out circumstances in which the counterfactual assertion of the abl  rule is or is not correct .",

    ", we shall first assume that these observables are discrete and nondegenerate .",
    "suppose that at time @xmath7 , @xmath3 is prepared in an eigenstate @xmath8 of @xmath4 . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the observable @xmath5 is measured . according to the born rule , the probability of obtaining result @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the set of eigenvalues of @xmath5 ) is given by @xmath12 .",
    "suppose the result @xmath10 is indeed obtained upon measurement at @xmath0 .",
    "we assume the measurement interaction is such that immediately after @xmath0 , the system is in state @xmath13 . at a later time",

    "hence the probability of result @xmath10 and result @xmath15 , conditional on preparation @xmath8 , is equal to @xmath17 we are interested here in the probability of obtaining @xmath10 at @xmath0 , on the condition that @xmath3 is prepared in @xmath8 at @xmath1 and found in @xmath18 at @xmath2 .",

    "we obtain @xmath25 this is the abl  rule@xcite . in the right - hand side ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are projectors on states @xmath8 and @xmath18 .",
    "the operator @xmath28 projects on @xmath13 or , if the eigenvalue @xmath10 is degenerate , on the associated subspace .",
    "is then carried out on these subspaces . ]",
    "the abl  rule ( expressed in terms of projection operators ) also holds in that case , provided the intermediate measurement obeys the lders rule @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is a normalization constant ) .",
    "the abl  rule can also be written for multiple intermediate measurements or for selection by means of density matrices rather than pure states , but we wo nt need these generalizations here .",
    "a much discussed property of the abl  rule is its contextuality .",
    "let @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 be an orthonormal basis in a three - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "each of these kets can represent a state wherein a particle is in one of three disjoint boxes .",
    "take the initial and final states as         let the intermediate observable @xmath5 be so chosen as to have @xmath31 as one of its eigenvectors , corresponding to a nondegenerate eigenvalue @xmath34 .",
    "the abl  rule then yields @xmath35 it turns out that the right - hand side of this equation is not well - defined unless @xmath5 itself is well - defined .",
    "let @xmath34 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 be three different real numbers and define @xmath38 elementary algebra shows that @xmath39 .",
    "but if @xmath40 then @xmath41 .",
    "hence the abl probability of @xmath34 depends not only on the eigenspace associated with that eigenvalue , but also on the structure of the observable in the orthogonal eigenspace .",
    "this is contextuality . in terms of boxes , this means the following . if an observable ( @xmath42 ) distinguishes the first box from the other two taken together , then the abl probability of being in the first box is  1 .",
    "if another observable ( @xmath5 ) distinguishes the three boxes one from another , the abl probability of being in the first box is 1/3 .",
    "it is easy to check that if @xmath43 , @xmath44 likewise if @xmath45 , @xmath46 from  ( [ pa ] ) and  ( [ pb ] ) , albert , aharonov and damato have argued that noncommuting observables @xmath4 and @xmath6 must be simultaneously well - defined at @xmath0@xcite .",
    "this conclusion hinges on a counterfactual use of the abl  rule .",
    "it was indeed intended to apply specifically to the case where neither @xmath4 nor @xmath6 are measured between pre- and postselection .",
    "can the abl  rule be interpreted counterfactually ?",
    "that question was answered in the negative by sharp and shanks@xcite , cohen@xcite and miller@xcite , and much debated afterwards .",
    "the crux of the sharp and shanks argument ( as well as others ) can be stated rather succinctly .",
    "let @xmath47 and @xmath48 be the possible final states of a two - state system .",
    "suppose @xmath5 is not measured , and assume that the abl  rule correctly gives the probability of nondegenerate result @xmath34 , conditional on pre- and postselection , had @xmath5 been measured .",
    "the total probability of @xmath34 should then be given as a weighted sum on the possible final states , that is , @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the probability of final state @xmath18 when no intermediate measurement is made , and @xmath51 is the conditional probability of @xmath34 based on the counterfactual interpretation of the abl  rule . but according to standard quantum mechanics , @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 .",
    "hence we should have @xmath54 since this is not true in general ( counterexamples are easily found ) , sharp and shanks conclude that the counterfactual use is invalid .",
    "the validity of the counterfactual use and the relevance of the sharp and shanks argument were debated between vaidman@xcite and kastner@xcite .",
    "vaidman s objection to the proof consists in pointing out that the weight @xmath50 in ( [ ss ] ) is the probability of @xmath15 if no intermediate measurement occurs .",
    "since we are asking for the total probability of result @xmath34 , we must use the expression for the probability of @xmath15 if @xmath5 is measured at @xmath0 . that probability",
    "is given by @xmath55 .",
    "but then eq .  ( [ ss ] ) becomes    p(c_1 |a ) & = & _ j ( p_b p_c_j p_a p_c_j ) p(c_1 |a , b ) + _ j ( p_b p_c_j p_a p_c_j ) p(c_1 |a , b ) + & = & ( p_b p_c_1 p_a p_c_1 ) + ( p_b p_c_1 p_a p_c_1 ) + & = & ( p_c_1 p_a p_c_1 ) + & = & |c_1 |a |^2 , [ ss1 ]    in accordance with standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the significance of this calculation of @xmath52 is best brought out by quoting vaidman s definition of the counterfactual meaning of the abl  rule@xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if a measurement of an observable @xmath5 were performed at time @xmath0 , then the probability for @xmath56 would equal @xmath57 , provided that the results of measurements performed on the system at times @xmath7 and @xmath14 are fixed . _",

    "both this statement and vaidman s definition express the regularity of nature .",
    "both assert , on the basis of a general rule drawn from numerous experimental trials , that if the experiment were done over again in the same relevant conditions , the results would fall under the same general rule .",
    "hence vaidman s statement is ( presumably ) true , genuinely counterfactual , but not particularly illuminating , at least as far as specificities of quantum mechanics are concerned .",
    "in contrast with vaidman , kastner defended the sharp and shanks proof and argued that a nontrivial counterfactual assertion of the abl  rule ( i.e.  one that provides information about specific systems ) is false .",
    "kastner s analysis draws from both goodman s and lewis s theories of counterfactuals@xcite .",
    "her argument can be summarized as follows .",
    "a counterfactual @xmath58 ( read `` if it were that @xmath59 , it would be that @xmath60 . '' ) is true if @xmath59 is not true and the conjunction of @xmath59 with laws of nature @xmath61 and suitable background conditions @xmath3 implies @xmath60 , that is , @xmath62 now clearly , there must be restrictions on @xmath3 for , if @xmath3 includes the statement @xmath63 ( `` not @xmath59 '' ) , implication  ( [ pls ] ) will hold trivially .",
    "these restrictions usually state that @xmath3 should be `` cotenable '' with @xmath59 , a notion not so easy to define but essentially meaning that @xmath3 is independent of the truth of @xmath59 .",
    "suppose that in the real world , preparation @xmath8 is followed by postselection @xmath18 , with no intermediate measurement .",
    "then had there been an intermediate measurement , the intermediate state would have changed , and the final measurement result @xmath15 could no longer be expected to obtain . in other words ,",
    "result @xmath15 is not cotenable with measuring @xmath5 .",
    "does it follow from this argument that the nontrivial counterfactual assertion of the abl  rule is false ?",
    "the answer is affirmative if the background conditions must include the result @xmath15 .",
    "but this is not necessarily the case .",
    "the background conditions can be construed as encompassing everything that characterizes the state of the system at @xmath0 , including whatever might induce it to yield result @xmath15 upon measurement of @xmath6 at @xmath14 . with such a definition ,",
    "the result @xmath15 itself is not part of the background conditions .",
    "and although cotenability might be analyzed in that context , i shall use a different approach .",
    "i submit that the proper way of investigating the counterfactual validity of the abl  rule is to enquire about the `` true value '' of @xmath5 at @xmath0 .",
    "strict empiricists will no doubt quit reading right here , since it is absolutely impossible , in a situation where @xmath5 has not been measured between @xmath7 and @xmath14 , to empirically ascertain what the true value of @xmath5 was at the intermediate time @xmath0 .",
    "but that does nt prevent different theories or interpretations to make claims on what the true value is , as we will presently see .",
    "it is instructive to analyze the sharp and shanks argument in terms of true values .",
    "if , following standard quantum mechanics , @xmath52 is equal to @xmath64 , then the first equality in  ( [ ss1 ] ) holds identically .",
    "but sharp and shanks claim that the counterfactual meaning of the abl  rule is encapsulated in eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that ( [ ss ] ) and  ( [ ss1 ] ) will coincide if @xmath65 together with a similar equation with @xmath15 replaced by @xmath66 . in quantum mechanics , eq .",
    "( [ bcac ] ) does not hold in general .",
    "the left - hand side of ( [ bcac ] ) is the uncontroversial probability of @xmath15 when no intermediate measurement is performed , while the right - hand side is the uncontroversial probability of @xmath15 when @xmath5 is measured at the intermediate time . that the equality is false means that whichever true value @xmath5 does or does not have at the intermediate time @xmath0 , it can not be one that is simply revealed in and unaffected by an eventual measurement .",
    "it was pointed out in@xcite that ( [ bcac ] ) holds if @xmath67 makes up a consistent family of histories . indeed in that case one can maintain that @xmath5 has a well - defined value ( equal to one of its eigenvalues ) without running into contradictions .",
    "but of course one is not compelled to do so .",
    "associating or not associating true values to observables belonging to a consistent family of histories contributes in defining the interpretation of the theory .",
    "it is instructive to recall the example of sect .  2 , with @xmath8 and @xmath18 defined as in eqs .  ( [ ar ] ) and  ( [ br ] )",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath42 be defined as in  ( [ obsc ] ) and  ( [ obsc1 ] ) and let @xmath68 it is easy to check that @xmath69 and @xmath70 make up distinct consistent families of histories .",
    "the abl probability that @xmath71 is one , and so is the abl probability that @xmath72 .",
    "we wo nt run into contradictions if we maintain that the particle was surely in box  1 at  @xmath0 .",
    "likewise we wo nt run into contradictions if we maintain that it was in box  2 .",
    "of course both statements can not be held at once , since they are logically contradictory .",
    "note that the family of histories @xmath73 more refined than either ( [ h1 ] ) or  ( [ h2 ] ) , is not consistent .",
    "the families @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 stand for the set of eigenvalues of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , are always consistent .",
    "hence it can be maintained that @xmath4 has the true value @xmath78 at intermediate times , or that @xmath6 has the true value @xmath15 .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath20 .",
    "therefore @xmath18 and @xmath8 are not orthogonal .",
    "so it is not a priori logically inconsistent to assume that @xmath4 and @xmath6 both have true values at intermediate times .",
    "denotes the projector on the subspace spanned by @xmath8 and @xmath18 , then the family of histories @xmath79 is consistent . ]",
    "it is not clear whether a full - fledged interpretation can be implemented along these lines , for arbitrary observables @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the abl  rule is symmetric under permutation of preselection and postselection .",
    "this means that for the purpose of making probabilistic statements about intermediate measurement outcomes , the initial and final states @xmath8 and @xmath18 have exactly the same utility .",
    "this does not necessarily entail that they are equally useful for the purpose of making ontological statements . in von neumann s measurement theory@xcite , for instance ,",
    "a measurement is an interaction between a quantum system and an apparatus , followed by a collapse . from the time @xmath7 when the system is prepared in state @xmath8 to the time @xmath0 when an ontological statement is to be made ,",
    "no physical action occurs on the system .",
    "such is not the case , however , between @xmath0 and @xmath14 . indeed",
    "a physical interaction of the quantum system with an apparatus has to occur sometime before @xmath14 , for the system to collapse to @xmath18 at @xmath14 . in that context",
    ", it may be more natural to hold that @xmath8 , rather than @xmath18 , is the correct state at @xmath0 , and that @xmath80 , rather than @xmath81 , expresses a true value .    in some interpretations of quantum mechanics ,",
    "true values of observables can be assigned outside the context of consistent families of histories .",
    "their statistical distributions , however , will not obey the abl  rule .",
    "an example is bohmian mechanics , where the true value of position is defined at any intermediate time@xcite .",
    "but in general , @xmath82 does not make up a consistent family . in this context , the meaning of background conditions proposed at the end of the last section is particularly clear .",
    "suppose that @xmath83 and @xmath47 correspond to one - dimensional wave functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 , with @xmath86 a gaussian and @xmath87 a function uniform over some interval @xmath88 and zero elsewhere ( i.e.  @xmath47 postselects through a slit of width @xmath88 ) .",
    "all bohmian trajectories going through @xmath88 at @xmath14 have gone through some other interval @xmath89 at  @xmath0 .",
    "hence the background conditions associated with preselection @xmath83 and postselection @xmath47 are the wave function at  @xmath0 together with the interval @xmath89 of true positions .",
    "of course if position is measured at  @xmath0 , the wave function will change accordingly , and so will the measurement result probabilities at  @xmath14 .",
    "it was pointed out by vaidman@xcite that no hidden variable theory can reproduce the abl  rule in all situations .",
    "indeed take an ensemble of spin 1/2 particles prepared in the state @xmath90 .",
    "if there is no intermediate measurement , postselection in the state @xmath91 will in fact introduce no additional selection .",
    "hence if no backward causality is assumed , true values at @xmath0 must be the same whether postselection does or does not occur , irrespective of any hidden variables .",
    "but then the probability that a measurement at @xmath0 of the spin along @xmath92 yields @xmath93 must be equal to @xmath94 , which differs from the abl  value .    in the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics ( or at least in the most instrumentalistic versions of it ) , an observable @xmath5 has a value only when a measurement of @xmath5 indicates that value .",
    "this is also the case in mohrhoff s more recent interpretation@xcite , which incorporates the abl  rule explicitly .",
    "the fact that the abl  rule predicts a statistical distribution of values of @xmath5 implies , according to mohrhoff , an objective fuzziness of @xmath5 in the case where the experiment is not performed .",
    "i believe that statement is genuinely and nontrivially counterfactual .",
    "it asserts that no unmeasured observable of no individual system whatsoever has a true value in the interval between pre- and postselection .",
    "the noncounterfactual meaning of the abl  rule is not controversial .",
    "the validity of the rule is then a straightforward consequence of standard quantum mechanics and usual hypotheses on the state of a quantum system immediately after measurement .",
    "the rule is also true counterfactually if it simply expresses the reproducibility of experiments .",
    "a counterfactual meaning more relevant to the specificities of quantum mechanics refers to the true value of an observable at an intermediate time , when no observable is actually measured between pre- and postselection . in general",
    "the abl  rule is then counterfactually false .",
    "it can be true , however , when associated with a consistent family of histories or when asserting objective fuzziness or nonvaluedness of observables not being measured .",
    "although statements about true values between pre- and postselection may not have definite empirical meaning , they can fruitfully be viewed as contributing to define the interpretation of the quantum - mechanical theory .",
