    "the reproducibility of the fluctuations and their strong temperature dependence suggest a quantum origin .",

    "@xcite the corresponding local density of states ( ldos ) shows a peak at this value of @xmath50 , localized in between the scatterer and the center of the mb .",
    "this indicates that the mb acts as a repulsive scatterer which forms one mirror of a resonator for electron waves .",
    "further simulations ( not shown ) reveal that the position and the shape of such resonances depend sensitively on the position of the scatterer , and both peaks as well as dips in @xmath99 are observed as the position of the scatterer is varied .",
    "moreover , the character of the resonances does not change as the sign of the scattering potential is reversed .",
    "we note that this type of resonance is the only one we could identify in our simulations , suggesting that the magnetoresistance fluctuations originate from a superposition of such resonances .    with this interpretation in mind",
    ", it is insightful to return to the comparison of the magnetoconductance of quantum wires in homogeneous vs. localized perpendicular magnetic fields ( figs .",
    "[ mbcfinqwr_fig2 ] and [ mbcfinqwr_fig3 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "first of all , the negative magnetoresistance in homogeneous magnetic fields is absent in qwrs with a mb in its center .",
    "this is easily understandable since this effect originates from a magnetic field induced reduction of electron reflections at the entrance of the qwr .",
    "@xcite at these points , however , the magnetic field of the mb is negligible .",
    "second , the weak localization peak observed in homogeneous magnetic fields @xcite is not always observed in qwrs with mbs and has no characteristic shape .",
    "we speculate that the field of the mb acts as an x - dependent phase shifter for states which are weakly localized by scattering at the impurities .",
    "how exactly weak localization in qwrs exposed to localized magnetic fields modifies the conductance remains to be studied in future theoretical work .",
    "however , a heuristic argument delivers a plausible explanation for the width of the broad conductance dip . in homogeneous magnetic fields , the half width at half maximum @xmath104 of the weak localization dip corresponds to a characteristic area @xmath105 .",
    "@xcite we observe a conductance dip of width @xmath106 , corresponding to an average magnetic field in the qwr of @xmath107 .",
    "the characteristic area is thus @xmath108 . assuming a wire width of @xmath28 , a characteristic length of @xmath109 is obtained , which appears realistic for the average extension of a backscattering loop along the qwr .",
    "furthermore , the resistance fluctuation amplitude at identical sample mobilities and temperatures is enhanced in the samples with the mb .",
    "qualitatively , this can be understood along the same lines as cooldown - dependent , irregularly shaped weak localization dip : since the section of the qwr which is tuned by the mb is much shorter than its length , the averaging of the conductance fluctuations is reduced , leading to larger fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "after @xmath110 holding time in each point ( a ) and the time dependence of @xmath40 at points 1 to 3 ( b ) . ]    finally , we would like to dwell on the measured deviations from the expected symmetry relation @xmath111 . in the right inset in fig .",
    "[ mbcfinqwr_fig2 ] ( a ) , one observes resistance differences up to @xmath112 for some magnetic fields , while the main features are present in both up and down sweeps . in order to detect a possible time dependence of @xmath40 ,",
    "we have changed @xmath49 from @xmath113 to @xmath114 in @xmath115 steps , and measured @xmath116 up to a time of @xmath117 for each step .",
    "[ mbcfinqwr_fig6](a ) shows @xmath118 for @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "[ mbcfinqwr_fig6](b ) , the evolution of @xmath118 over time at three values of @xmath49 are reproduced .",
    "one point each was chosen to the right ( 1 ) and to the left ( 3 ) of a local resistance maximum , where the susceptibility to small variations of the magnetization is high , and one point ( 2 ) near a local resistance maximum .",
    "the resistance at point ( 1 ) increases by @xmath119 in @xmath120 , while at point ( 2 ) , the change in magnetization drives the wire resistance through the local maximum with a variation over time of @xmath121 only , and in point ( 3 ) , the resistance drops by @xmath122 over @xmath120 . since the time constant of the low - pass filter in our measurement setup",
    "is set to @xmath123 , these observations can not be explained by external effects .",
    "rather , we attribute them to changes in the film magnetization with time due to thermal activation over local energy barriers , also known as _ magnetic aftereffect _ , which are reported to show a similar time dependence in other co films .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , these time - dependent changes in @xmath40 can not be correlated to those observed in the hysteresis loop ( @xmath37 ) , since the qwr probes the edge of the co film locally , while the hall sensing averages over the edge on its opposite side .",
    "hence , even though magnetic relaxation effects do contribute to the asymmetry of @xmath40 , their amplitude in resistance is significantly smaller than the maximum deviations observed between up- and down - sweeps of @xmath49",
    ". therefore , we believe that the asymmetry originates from both background charge rearrangements in the semiconductor as well as from magnetic relaxation in the ferromagnet .",
    "in summary , we have presented experimental and numerical studies regarding the transport properties of a quasi - ballistic quantum wire exposed to a highly localized perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the magnetoresistance of this system differs distinctly from that one known from quantum wires exposed to homogeneous magnetic fields : the negative magnetoresistance is absent , while the amplitude of the conductance fluctuations is enhanced . in addition , a broad minimum in the magnetoconductance is observed and interpreted as an indication of weak localization . within a recursive green s function model , it is found that the conductance fluctuations originate from electronic interferences between electrostatic scatterers and the magnetic barrier .",
    "we hope that these findings will motivate further theoretical studies to elucidate the physics of this system in quantitative terms .",
