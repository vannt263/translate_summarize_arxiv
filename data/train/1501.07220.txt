    "high space velocities of ob runaway stars are explained by two independent mechanisms : dynamical ejection due to gravitational interactions of massive stars in cluster cores @xcite and binary disruption as a result of a supernova explosion of the initially more massive component @xcite . both scenarios are viable , but whether one of the mechanisms is dominant is still uncertain . according to the virial theorem , through a symmetric supernova explosion in a binary system ,",
    "if more than half of the total mass of the system is released , then the new born neutron star ( or black hole ) and the non  degenerate component are no more gravitationally bound @xcite .",
    "however , the energy stored in the orbit , in most cases , is not sufficient to produce the neutron star kick velocities that are typically in the range of 300500 @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry in supernova explosions is responsible for such high velocities .",
    "therefore , there are no pulsar companions to many of the ob runaway stars @xcite . in some cases",
    ", the compact object does not receive a significant kick and/or the majority of the total mass is stored on the secondary through conservative mass transfer , hence , the compact object remains bound to the companion star @xcite . the runaway high mass x ",

    "the kinematics of the binary disruption due to an asymmetric supernova explosion is widely discussed in . however , a sample of observationally confirmed ob runaway ",
    "ns couples is needed for a better understanding of the problem .",
    "the importance of searching for ob runaways inside snrs was first mentioned in @xcite .",
    "however , the kinematical study of known ob stars inside snrs was concluded with a lack of ob runaways due to the poor sample of snrs and ob stars . still , there is no known o or b  type runaway star that can be directly linked to an snr given in the literature .    in g05",
    ", the outcome of exploring runaway pairs from binary supernova disruption is broadly discussed .",
    "firstly , identifying the explosion centers more precisely will be useful for determining the velocities of young nss of which proper motion measurements have high uncertainties .",
    "thus , the kick that is gained by the ns due to the asymmetry of the sn can be determined more precisely .",
    "secondly , the distance to the remnant can be measured more accurately by studying the runaway star , as it can not move far away from the explosion center in the observational lifetime of the snr .",
    "finally , possible effects of a close binary system on the asymmetry of the sne can also be examined .",
    "additionally , it would be a direct evidence of the binary supernova scenario ( bss ) .",
    "the observational efforts are concentrated on runaway ",

    "were traced back in time by using 3d monte carlo simulations .",
    "they were found at the same position and the same time inside a young open cluster .",
    "the psrj0630 - 2834 ",
    "pair is thought to be ejected from very old snr antlia .",
    "there are considerable uncertainties in these cases as the supernova events took place more than yr ago .",
    "the separation between the objects is very large and the snr has faded away long ago and/or the components are outside of the snr ( the antlia case ) .",
    "other important observational evidence is the enhancement of @xmath6process elements in the hyper ",
    "velocity star hd271791 .",
    "the star is proposed to be ejected from a massive close binary system due to an sn that enriches its photosphere in elements which can be synthesized in large amounts during the evolution of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "the method followed in our work is a direct study of possible runaway stars inside snrs as described in g05 .",
    "briefly , assuming that the massive binary mass ratio is greater than 1:4 , ob ",
    "type star candidates are determined by a careful study of their bvjhk magnitudes obtained from the ucac4 catalog @xcite .",
    "the angular separation of the sources from the geometrical centers of the remnants are within the limits of the maximum angular distance that a runaway star can have in a lifetime of an snr .",
    "the distance moduli are calculated for all sources within this region , and the sources having extinctions and radial distances consistent with those of the snrs are considered as `` candidates '' . measuring the radial velocities and identifying the spectral types of these objects via spectroscopy reveal their runaway nature , their youth and the exact spatial relations with the snrs , in other words , the genetic connections .",
    "although the runaway stars arising from bss may also be late type stars , it is time consuming to check the possible runaway nature of all the stars inside each snr .",
    "also , the late type stars are too faint to observe at large distances . a star having the same age as a supernova progenitor must be young . as ob type stars evolve faster",
    ", they automatically satisfy this condition .",
    "furthermore , high mass stars are rare objects .",
    "an ob runaway star discovered inside an snr can be explained by the bss .",
    "considering the very short observable lifetimes of snrs and relatively short later evolution stages of stars , most probably , main sequence stars are expected as ob runaways connected to snrs .",
    "the space velocity of an ob runaway star is thought to be larger than 30@xmath740 @xcite .",
    "a more precise value is proposed in @xcite ; 28 in 3d and 20 in 2d .",
    "to summarize , a main  sequence ob type star of which at least one component of the velocity vector is greater than 20 is searched in selected snrs .",
    "the first criterion of the candidate selection is the restriction of the angular position .",
    "most of the ob runaways have peculiar velocities lower than 80 @xcite . as the shock wave velocity of the snrs",
    "are decelerated from roughly 10000 to several hundred , it is expected that the runaway star can not exceed one tenth of the angular diameter ( @xmath8 ) of the related snr .",
    "this value is somewhat relaxed to @xmath8/6 considering the uncertainties in the geometrical centers of the snrs .",
    "the stars in this region are expected to be consistent with the respective snr in terms of distance and reddening .    for this comparison ,",
    "the adopted distances of snrs given in @xcite , and values from @xcite were used .",
    "48 snrs within 5 from the sun were selected for investigation .         in this paper , the result of the runaway search in snr g180.0 - 1.7 ( s147 ) is given .",

    "supernova binary is constructed .",

    "it is 180 arcmin in diameter with a geometrical center ( gc ) at @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it was first mentioned as an snr candidate in @xcite .",

    "the shell structure is well defined and dominated by filamentary emission in .",
    "the emission is brighter in the north and south edges and mainly concentrated in the southern parts . despite of its old age",
    ", it conserves the spherical symmetry except for the blowout regions in east and west ( figure [ f : mosaic ] ) .",
    "the total absorption in the v band is = @xmath11 magnitude @xcite .",
    "radio observations reveal that the spectral index is unusually varying .",
    "the shell structure observed at radio wavelengths coincides with that in optical bands and is well defined .",
    "but , no x  ray emission is observed from the remnant . suggested distances vary from 0.6 to 1.9 in various publications ( table [ t : snr_distance ] ) .",
    "four of the measurements are based on relation which is useful to estimate the distance by using the surface brightness of the snr . in @xcite and , the model of @xcite",

    "the radius lower limit calculated through snr dynamics based on the model of @xcite sets another constraint on the snr distance .",

    "the runaway nature of hd37424 is clear .",
    "the chance projection of such a massive runaway star moving away from the gc of an snr in the galactic anti ",

    "in addition , combining with the central compact object after tracing back both objects at the same time shows that hd37424 is clearly the pre ",
    "supernova binary companion of the progenitor of snr s147 and psrj0538 + 2817 .",
    "bss is the favored explanation for its runaway nature .",
    "hd37424 is a b0.5v type star with a mass of @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "so , the progenitor of the pulsar must have a higher mass .",
    "based on the lack of o type stars in the field ( see table [ t:26_stars ] ) we set an upper mass limit of 2025 .",
    "it may even imply a twin binary .",
    "the roche lobe radii calculated for 15 , 20 and 25 vary between 91 and 311 which shows that the system might have been an interacting binary .",
    "hence , the progenitor star should be a naked helium star at the final stage of its evolution with a mass even as low as 2 @xcite , @xcite .",

    "this also makes a plausible explanation for the low density medium in which the snr expands symmetrically .",
    "but , an ejection of the pre - sn system is also possible .",
    "a membership to an ob association or to a cluster is important also regarding the distance determination . in this work ,",
    "the distance derived from pulsar parallax ( @xmath28 ) is accepted as the most reliable estimation .",

    "photometric distance is much larger by using absolute magnitudes from @xcite . yet , by using typical luminosities for b0.5v type suggested in @xcite , it is 1318@xmath0119 .",
    "hence , the distance to the star and the snr can be assumed to be 1.3 .",
    "however , the measured directly towards s147 is much lower than the towards the stars beyond 1 .",
    "furthermore , two stars , hd36665 and hd37318 , show highly shifted interstellar and lines related to the snr implying that these objects are background sources .",

    "today s kinematics of the stars are well known , further detailed calculations should be done to find the true kick vectors of the pulsar and a possible spin - kick alignment .    there is no known ob association reported close to the snr .",
    "19 ob type stars within 100from the snr geometrical center have very similar 2d velocities with the 5 runaway stars including hd37424 .",
    "this might be an old ob association having no bright o type stars .",
