    "if future long baseline neutrino experiments are to achieve systematic uncertainties of @xmath3  @xcite , our knowledge of the nucleus in neutrino interactions needs to be improved .",
    "uncertainties in the dynamics of the nucleus propagate through to oscillation analysis in two forms : neutrino energy reconstruction and in the evaluation of selection efficiencies for the respective signal and background  @xcite .",
    "isolating neutrino interactions on hydrogen  @xcite alleviates experimenters from many of these uncertainties , resulting in improved neutrino energy reconstruction and access to precise measurements of neutrino - nucleon interaction parameters such as the resonance axial mass .",
    "r0.5    dptt_3d.eps ( 175,-10 )    following on from  @xcite which outlined the selection and reconstruction of exclusive charged current final states containing a single muon , proton and @xmath2 ( cc1p1@xmath2 ) , and discussed the implementation of the double transverse momentum variable , @xmath4  @xcite , used to isolate interactions on hydrogen at t2k s near detector , nd280 , we present an update on the analysis . in  @xcite , we outlined a means of extracting the hydrogen signal by fitting functional forms to the signal and background , here , we discuss an alternative approach outlined in  @xcite for determining the signal component .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dptt_schem ] , in the absence of nuclear effects in which interactions take place on a free nucleon , @xmath5 , @xmath4  is balanced whereas bound nucleons , @xmath6 , have some initial isotropic fermi motion and can undergo final state interactions resulting in @xmath4  being imbalanced .",
    "a full discussion of @xmath4  can be found in  @xcite .",
    "given the variables ability to extract events on hydrogen , our focus here is on the signal extraction for an absolute cross section where flux , detector and model systematics are included .",
    "finally , the cc1p1@xmath2-hydrogen energy dependence is considered .",
    "the signal extraction technique is based on the likelihood method  @xcite that enables both model and detector systematic uncertainties to be included in the fit as nuisance parameters . in this approach",
    "we are fitting the number of selected events as a function of @xmath4  ( and @xmath7 for energy dependent case ) by minimising @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of observed and @xmath10 is the number of expected events in reconstructed bin @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the penalty term for the model and detector systematics . in the fit , the parameters of interest , @xmath13 , which are encompassed in the @xmath10 term are adjusted to best fit the mc hydrogen - cc1p1@xmath2cross section @xmath14 given the data .",
    "the @xmath10 term reads @xmath15 here @xmath16 runs over ` true ' @xmath4  ( and @xmath7 for energy dependent case ) bins prior to detector effects , @xmath17 considers all background reactions .",
    "theoretical uncertainties in the background predictions are included by the product of weighting functions , @xmath18 for a given @xmath17 background .",
    "these functions account for variations in ` true ' and reconstructed @xmath4  as a result in our knowledge of the theoretical model parameter @xmath19 .",
    "detector effects are described by the matrix , @xmath20 , which maps true ( i ) to reconstructed ( j ) bins .",
    "the nuisance parameter vectors for model ( @xmath19 ) and detector ( @xmath21 ) systematics are constrained by prior covariance matrices .",
    "the final term , @xmath22 encompass flux dependences associated to each true bin .",
    "presented is the outcome of mc data to mc data fits using the likelihood method defined above . in fig .",
    "[ fig : absxs ] , the inputs prior to fitting ( _ left _ ) and the fitted output ( _ right _ ) for the absolute cross section are given . here the ` true ' mc signal is shown along with its reconstructed counterpart and the full reconstructed mc .",
    "we include uncertainties from detector , model and flux systematics .",
    "unique to this technique of isolating nuclear effects is that there is only one signal bin in each @xmath4  distribution as seen in the mc signal , leaving only one @xmath13 to be determined .",
    "it is clear from the fitted result we are currently overestimating the signal , however this bias is expected to be removed once the implementation of model uncertainties are re - evaluated .",
    "one should note that the dominant uncertainties are coming from the detector systematics but these have not yet been optimised for this absolute cross section measurement",
    ".    outlined in  @xcite , is a method in which an energy dependent measurement on hydrogen can be achieved .",
    "we , for the first time , present such an energy dependent result where only statistical errors are considered .",
    "this reduces eqn .",
    "[ eqn : nexp ] to @xmath23 .",
    "one should note that , there are now two @xmath13 terms to match the number of energy bins .",
    "the outcome of the fit can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : enuxs ] , on the left , the @xmath4  fit for each energy bin shows good agreement between the true and fitted result .",
    "the reconstructed energy dependence of the cc1p1@xmath2-hydrogen signal is presented in the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : enuxs ] .",
    "the uncertainty on the @xmath24 energy bin is hidden by the bin width normalisation .",
    "the statistical approach defined here , for both an absolute and energy dependent cross section highlight the potential of the @xmath4  variable to isolate interactions in hydrogen .",
    "work towards understanding where biases arise when model systematics are included in the fit is ongoing and further evaluation of the dominant systematic , arising from the detector need to be considered .",
    "it is hoped that such uncertainties can be reduced by optimising the selection .",
