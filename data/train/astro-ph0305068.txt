    "over the last years , a considerable number of high quality observational data have transformed radically the field of cosmology .",
    "results from distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite combined with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite and dynamical estimates of the quantity of matter in the universe @xcite seem to indicate that the simple picture provided by the standard cold dark matter scenario ( scdm ) is not enough . these observations are usually explained by introducing a new hypothetical energy component with negative pressure , the so - called dark energy or _ quintessence _ @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , the existence of this dark component would also provide a definitive piece of information connecting the inflationary flatness prediction with astronomical data .",
    "on the other hand , it is also well known that not less exotic mechanisms like , e.g. , geometrical effects from extra dimensions may be capable of explaning such observational results .",
    "the basic idea behind these  braneworld cosmologies \" is that our 4-dimensional universe would be a surface or a brane embedded into a higher dimensional bulk space - time to which gravity could spread @xcite . in some of these scenarios",
    "the observed acceleration of the universe can be explained ( without dark energy ) from the fact that the bulk gravity sees its own curvature term on the brane acting as a negative - pressure dark component which accelerates the universe @xcite .",
    "a natural conclusion from these and other similar studies is that dark energy , or rather , the gravitational effects of a dark energy could actually be achieved from a modification of the friedmann equation arising from new physics .    following this reasoning ,",
    "several authors have recently investigated cosmologies with a modified friedmann equation from extra dimensions as an alternative explanation for the recent observational data .",
    "for example , sahni & shtanov @xcite investigated a new class of braneworld models which admit a wider range of possibilities for dark energy than do the usual quintessence scenarios . for a subclass of the parameter values",
    ", they showed that the acceleration of the universe in this class of models can be a transient phenomena which could help reconcile an accelerating universe with the requirements of string / m - theory @xcite .",
    "recently , dvali & turner @xcite explored the phenomenology and detectability of a correction on the friedmann equation of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the matter density parameter , @xmath8 is the hubble parameter ( the subscript  o \" refers to present time ) and @xmath9 is a parameter to be adjusted by the observational data .",
    "such a correction behaves like a dark energy with an effective equation of state given by @xmath10 in the recent past and like a cosmological constant ( @xmath11 ) in the distant future .",
    "also based on extra dimensions physics , freese & lewis @xcite proposed the so - called _ cardassian expansion _ , a model in which the universe is flat , matter dominated and currently accelerated . in the cardassian universe ,",
    "the new friedmann equation is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an arbitrary function of the matter energy density @xmath2 .",
    "the first version of these scenarios had @xmath14 , with the second term driving the acceleration of the universe at a late epoch after it becomes dominant ( a detailed discussion for the origin of this cardassian term from extra dimensions physics can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "although being completely different from the physical viewpoint , it was promptly realized that by identifying some free parameters cardassian models and quintessence scenarios parameterized by an equation of state @xmath15 predict the same observational effects in what concerns tests involving only the evolution of the hubble parameter with the redshift @xcite .",
    "more recently , several forms for the function @xmath13 have been proposed @xcite . in particular , wang _",
    "_ @xcite have studied some observational characteristics of a direct generalization of the original cardassian model .",
    "according to these authors , the observational expressions in this new scenario are very different from generic quintessence cosmologies and fully determined by two dimensionless parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "observational constraints from a variety of astronomical data have been also investigated recently , both in the original cardassian model @xcite and in its generalized versions @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting feature of these models is that although being matter dominated , they may be accelerating and can still reconcile the indications for a flat universe ( @xmath16 ) from cmb observations with the clustering estimates that point consistently to @xmath17 with no need to invoke either a new dark component or a curvature term . in these scenarios , it happens through a redefinition of the value of the critical density @xcite ( see also below ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore some observational consequences of these generalized cardassian ( gc ) scenarios .",
    "we mainly focus our attention on the constraints that can be placed on the free parameters of the model ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) from statistical properties of gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "we show that for a large interval of these parameters , this class of models are fully compatible with the current gravitationally lensed quasar data .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of other observational quantities like the deceleration parameter , age - redshift relation and the acceleration redshift on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii the field equations and distance formulas are presented .",
    "we also derive the expression for the deceleration parameter , age of the universe and discuss the redshift at which the accelerated expansion begins .",
    "we then proceed to analyze the constraints from lensing statistics and on these scenarios in sec .",
    "we end the paper by summarizing the main results in the conclusion section .",
    "the modified friedmann equation for gc models is @xcite @xmath18^{1/q},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two free parameters to be adjusted by the observational data , @xmath19 is the energy density at which the two terms inside the bracket are equal and @xmath20 is the present day matter density . note that for values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , gc scenarios reduce to cold dark matter models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath23cdm ) . as explained in @xcite , the first term inside the bracket dominates initially in such a way that the standard picture of the early universe is completely maintained . at a redshift @xmath24 ,",
    "these two terms become equal and , afterwards , the second term dominates , leading or not to an accelerated expansion ( note , however , that @xmath25 is not necessarily the acceleration redshift .",
    "see , for instance , the discussion below on the deceleration parameter ) .",
    "evaluating eq .",
    "( 1 ) for present day quantities we find @xmath26^{1/q}.\\ ] ] from this equation , we see that @xmath20 is also the critical density that now can be written as @xmath27^{-{1/q}},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the standard critical density and @xmath29 is the present day hubble parameter in units of 100 @xmath30 .",
    "note that for some combinations of the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 the critical density can be much lower than the one previously estimated . in other words",
    "it means that in the context of gc models it is possible to make the dynamical estimates of the quantity of matter that consistently point to @xmath31 compatible with the observational evidence for a flat universe from cmb observations and the inflationary flatness prediction with no need of a dark energy component ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show a generalized version of the figure 1 of @xcite in which the plane @xmath32 is displayed for selected values of @xmath4 . the contours are labeled indicating the fraction of the standard critical density for different combinations of @xmath25 and @xmath3 . in particular , the points inside the shadowed area delimited by the contours 0.2 - 0.4 are roughly consistent with the present clustering estimates @xcite .    from eq . ( 3 ) , we see that the observed matter density parameter in gc models can be written as @xmath33^{-{1/q}},\\ ] ] which , from now on , we will fix at 0.3 ( in accordance to dynamical estimates of @xmath2 @xcite ) in order to discuss the acceleration redshift below and the lensing versus redshift test in the next section .    0.1 in    for the gc expansion parameterized by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the deceleration parameter as a function of the redshift has the following form @xmath34 where an overdot denotes derivative with respect to time , @xmath35 is the cosmological scale factor and @xmath36 is given by eq .",
    "figure 2 shows the behavior of the deceleration parameter as a function of redshift for selected values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as discussed earlier , although completely dominated by matter , gc scenarios allow periods of accelerated expansion for some combinations of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "note that the present acceleration is basically determined by the value of @xmath3 and that the smaller its value the more accelerated is the present expansion for a given value of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , for @xmath37 and @xmath21 , gc models accelerate presently faster ( @xmath38 ) than flat @xmath23cdm scenarios with @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) although the acceleration redshift is almost identical ( @xmath41 ) while for the same value of @xmath4 and @xmath42 we find @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in order to make clear the difference between @xmath25 and @xmath45 , for the latter values of @xmath4 and @xmath3",
    ", we find directly from eq.(4 ) @xmath46 .",
    "it means that although becoming dominant at @xmath47 the second term of eq .",
    "( 1 ) will drive an accelerated expansion only @xmath48 gyr later , at @xmath44 .    from the above equations , it is straightforward to show that the age - redshift relation is now given by ( the total expanding age of the universe @xmath49 is obtained by taking @xmath50 ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a convenient integration variable and the dimensionless function @xmath53 , obtained from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) , is written as @xmath54^{1/q}\\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    0.1 in    the comoving distance @xmath55 to a light source located at @xmath56 and @xmath57 and observed at @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be expressed as @xmath60 in order to derive the constraints from lensing statistics in the next section we shall deal with the concept of angular diameter distance .",
    "for the class of gc models here investigated , the angular diameter distance , @xmath61 , between two objects , for example a lens at @xmath62 and a source ( galaxy ) at @xmath63 , reads @xmath64",
    "in this section we use statistics of gravitationally lensed quasars to place limits on the free parameters of gc scenarios .",
    "we work with a sample of 867 ( @xmath65 ) high luminosity optical quasars which includes 5 lensed quasars .",
    "our sample consists of data from the following optical lens surveys : hst snapshot survey @xcite , crampton survey @xcite , yee survey @xcite , surdej survey @xcite , not survey @xcite and fks survey @xcite . since the main difference between the analysis performed in this section and the previous ones that use gravitational lensing statistics to constrain cosmological parameters is the cosmological model that here is being considered , we refer the reader to previous works for detailed formulas and calculational methods ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in order to perform our analysis",
    "we use the schechter luminosity function with the lens parameters for e / so galaxies taken from madgwick _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    0.1 in    0.1 in    the total optical depth @xmath71 along the line of sight from an observer at @xmath50 to a source at @xmath63 is given by @xmath72^{3 } r_{o}^{3}. \\label{atau}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the angular diameter distance ( eq .",
    "9 ) from the observer to the source . in fig . 3 for the fixed value of @xmath74",
    "we show the normalized optical depth as a function of the source redshift for values of @xmath75 0.3 , 1.0 , 2.0 and 3.0 and @xmath76 -1.0 , -0.5 , 0.0 and 0.5 .",
    "note that a decrease in the value of @xmath3 at fixed @xmath77 and @xmath4 tends to increase the optical depth for lensing . for @xmath78 at @xmath79 , the value of @xmath80 for @xmath42 is down from that one for @xmath81 by a factor of @xmath82 , while the same values of @xmath3 and @xmath83 provides values for @xmath80 that are up from the previous ones only by a factor of @xmath84 1.1 and 1.25 , respectively .",
    "it clearly shows that the optical depth is a more sensitive function to the parameter @xmath3 than to the index @xmath4 .",
    "as commented earlier , this particular feature is also noted for the other analyses discussed in this paper .",
    "the likelihood function is defined by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the number of multiple - imaged lensed quasars , @xmath87 is the number of unlensed quasars , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are , respectively , the probability of quasar @xmath90 to be lensed and the configuration probability ( see @xcite for details ) .    0.1 in    figure 4 shows contours of constant likelihood ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) in the parameter space @xmath93 . from the above equation",
    "we find that the maximum value of the likelihood function is located at @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) which corresponds to a currently decelerated universe with @xmath97 , i.e. , apparently in contradiction to the sne results ( it is worth mentioning that a low - density decelerated model is not ruled out by sne ia data alone @xcite , although such a model is strongly disfavored in the light of the recent cmb data ) . at the 1@xmath98 level , however , almost the entire range of @xmath4 ( if we consider for example @xmath99 ) is compatible with the observational data for a fixed value of @xmath100 .",
    "as observed earlier , this result suggests that a large class of gc scenarios is in accordance with the current gravitational lensing data . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also note that the gc best - fit model obtained from our analysis and the one obtained for general quintessence scenarios with an equation of state @xmath101 ( xcdm ) are very alike .",
    "for example , for xcdm models a similar analysis shows that the maximum value of the likelihood function is located at @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xcite which corresponds to a decelerated model with a deceleration parameter @xmath104 and a total expanding age of @xmath105 gyr .",
    "the best - fit for gc model also corresponds to a decelerated scenario with @xmath106 and a total age of the order of @xmath107 gyr .",
    "we suspect that this similarity may be associated with the fact that the likelihood analysis is more sensitive to @xmath3 than to @xmath4 and , as commented earlier , the original cardassian scenario ( which depends only on @xmath3 ) and xcdm models predict very similar observational results @xcite .",
    "these particular values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 for the best - fit gc model provide a predicted age of the universe old enough to accommodate some recent age estimates of high-@xmath108 objects .",
    "for example , at @xmath109 and @xmath110 eq .",
    "( 6 ) provides for @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 gyr and @xmath114 gyr , respectively , i.e. , values that are in agreement with the age estimates for the radio galaxies lbds 53w091 and lbds 53w069 @xcite .",
    "for the recent discovery of the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 @xcite at @xmath115 , however , these values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 provide @xmath116 gyr while the age estimate for this object lies between 2.0 - 3.0 gyr ( a similar problem is also faced by the concordance @xmath23cdm model @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "5a we show the expected number of lensed quasars , @xmath117 ( the summation is over a given quasar sample ) , as a function of the index @xmath4 for some selected values of @xmath3 .",
    "as indicated in the figure , the horizontal solid line stands for @xmath118 , that is the number of lensed quasars in our sample . by this analysis",
    ", one finds that models with ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) = ( -1.0 , 0.13 ) , ( -0.5 , 0.17 ) , ( 0.0 , 0.28 ) and ( 0.5 , 0.65 ) predict exactly 5 lensed quasars . in fig .",
    "3b we display the contour for five lensed quasars in the parametric space @xmath5 . as a general result",
    ", this analysis shows that a large number of models can accommodate the current gravitational lensing data .",
    "the possibility of an accelerating universe from distance measurements of type ia supernovae constitutes one of the most important results of modern cosmology .",
    "these observations naturally lead to the idea of a dominant dark energy component with negative pressure once all known types of matter with positive pressure generate attractive forces and decelerate the expansion of the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the realization that dark energy or the effects of dark energy could be a manifestation of a modification to the friedmann equation arising from extra dimension physics has opened up an unprecedented opportunity to establish a more solid connection between particle physics and cosmology .",
    "braneworld scenarios \" have been proposed in the recent literature with most of them presenting interesting features which make them a natural alternative to the standard model .",
    "here we have analyzed some observational consequences of one of these scenarios , the so - called generalized cardassian expansion recently proposed in ref .",
    "we have studied the observational constraints on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 that fully characterize the model from statistical properties of gravitational lensing . from this analysis",
    "we have found that at @xmath119 level a large class of these scenarios is in agreement with the current lensing data with the maximum of the likelihood function located at @xmath94 and @xmath95 which corresponds to a decelerated model with @xmath106 and a predicted age of the universe of the order of @xmath120 gyr .",
    "naturally , only with a more general analysis , possibly a joint investigation involving different classes of cosmological tests , it will be possible to show whether or not this class of models constitutes a viable alternative to the standard scenario .",
