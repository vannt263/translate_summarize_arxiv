    "baryon - meson effective - field theory is one of the most important approaches of hadron phenomenology adopted to extract form factors from experimental data and to model @xmath3 dependencies of the form factors ( dispersion relation approach , chiral perturbation theory , etc . )",
    "@xcite . however , there are a number of barriers to describing higher - spin nucleon resonances as effective fields , with the major barrier being problems with physical and mathematical consistency of the interaction lagrangians .",
    "most of these problems originate from the fact that spin-@xmath7 baryon resonances ( @xmath8 is equal to or greater than 3 ) are commonly described in terms of the reducible rarita - schwinger ( rs ) representations of the lorentz group @xcite .",
    "the rs fields comprise a spin cascade of irreducible states , @xmath9 the lower - spin components should be eliminated by subsidiary conditions imposed on the field .    while convenient to maintain manifest lorentz invariance of the theory , the rs fields are mathematically complicated structures possessing nontrivial intrinsic symmetries .",
    "the symmetries are inextricably linked to the constraints that are imposed on the reducible rs field to do away with the redundant degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "this is , perhaps , the most troublesome aspect of dealing with baryon resonances given by the rs fields , because the symmetries and constraints can be broken in the presence of interactions , which consequently lead to the excitation of the lower - spin components .",
    "this may result in superluminal propagation of the resonance @xcite and make the quantization of the field impossible @xcite .    for decades",
    "many efforts have been directed towards construction of the consistent interactions of the rs fields .",
    "most of the works seek the physical interpretation for the lower - spin components of the field @xcite .",
    "however , the most theoretically appealing solutions @xcite to the problem follow another way ; these do not invoke additional dof and rely on the interaction lagrangians that possess the same symmetries as the free - field rs theory . in particular , peccei @xcite suggested that consistent interaction lagrangians should be invariant under point transformations of the rs field .",
    "however , it was shown @xcite that the suggestion by peccei still does not exclude all the components of the interacting rs fields .",
    "much later , pascalutsa @xcite proposed the interaction lagrangians that are invariant under gauge transformation of the rs fields .",
    "such interactions do not involve lower - spin components of the rs fields , although for a specific value of off - shell parameters .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to write lagrangians for the interactions of higher - spin fields with nucleons that are invariant under both gauge and point transformations of the field .",
    "thus , this work can be regarded as a synthesis of the ideas expressed by peccei @xcite and pascalutsa @xcite .",
    "this synthesis results in the most constrained interactions preserving the highest degree of symmetry of the free rs field .",
    "such interactions are valid and universal in any formulation of the rs theory ( in theories with @xcite or without @xcite an _ a priori _ tracelessness condition imposed on the field ; in the second - order formalism @xcite ) . the point- and gauge - invariant interactions do not modify free - field covariant constraints .",
    "this property might be important , because constructing consistent nonminimal electromagnetic couplings of the rs fields without adding new dof appears to require that the free - field @xmath10-tracelessness condition is preserved by interactions @xcite .",
    "the point- and gauge - invariant interactions were studied earlier for spin-@xmath11 and -@xmath12 in refs .  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we generalize the results of refs .",
    "@xcite to the case of arbitrarily high spin of the resonance .",

    "[ rs formulation ] we briefly review the canonical theory of the free rs field . for the simplest case of spin-@xmath11 , we rederive the well - known facts that ( 1 ) the free - field theory is generated by a one - parameter equivalent class of lagrangians @xmath13 , with the free - field parameter @xmath14 amounting to a sort of rotation between the lower - spin components @xcite ; ( 2 ) the theory is invariant under gauge transformations of the field in the massless limit @xcite ; ( 3 ) the point transformations form the symmetry group of the equivalent class of the lagrangians @xcite .    finally , in sec .  [ rs formulation ]",
    "it is shown that point and gauge invariance of the interactions result in the restrictions on the tensor - spinor source @xmath15 , so that the simple subsidiary conditions on the free rs field hold in the presence of the interactions .    in sec .",
    "[ lagrangians ] we proceed to explicitly write the lagrangians of point and gauge invariant interactions of higher - spin baryon resonances with nucleons . to this end",
    ", we study the general algebraic properties of coupling matrices preserving required symmetries . in secs .",
    "[ constraints on kernels ] a basis set of such tensor matrices is determined .",
    "it is shown that there are only three basis matrices for any spin of the resonance .",
    "then we construct minimally local lagrangians of the interactions of baryon resonances with nucleons and pions and with nucleons and vector fields such as photons and vector mesons .",
    "we find that the symmetry classifies three terms of the lagrangian in terms of the chiralities of the baryons involved .",
    "the classification and the definition of the nucleon - to - resonance form factors is in accord with perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) at asymptotic momentum transfers  the chirality ( non)conserving form factors are asymptotically proportional to corresponding helicity ( non)conserving amplitudes .",
    "this means that form factors exhibit simple power - law scaling , while form factors of lower symmetry can potentially mix different - scale helicity conserving and nonconserving contributions .",
    "section  [ fit section ] concerns the point and gauge interactions of baryon resonances on the mass shell .",
    "the @xmath3 dependencies of the lagrangian form factors are parametrized in the vector dominance model developed in the papers  @xcite .",
    "the point- and gauge - invariant form factors exhibit peculiar gross features in their @xmath3 behavior .",
    "in particular , the data for @xmath4 allow for low-@xmath3 scaling of the form factor ratios similar to the analogous phenomena observed in the case of elastic form factors @xcite .",
    "in addition , the form factors for the transitions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are proportional to each other .",
    "describing baryons of spin @xmath18 as the rs fields @xmath19 of the tensor rank @xmath20 , we have to deal with the problems arising from the reducibility of the rs representations .",
    "the field @xmath19 contains @xmath21 components , which exceeds the number of spin-@xmath22 dof @xmath23 : @xmath24 to eliminate redundant dof , we have to impose @xmath25 constraints on the field , four - transversality and @xmath10-tracelessness conditions",
    "@xcite : @xmath26 these constraints are linked to the symmetries of the rs theory that we illustrate by the simplest case of a vector - spinor field .",
    "the general lagrangian for a vector - spinor field @xcite can be written as @xmath27 \\psi^\\nu      { } - \\bar\\psi_\\mu j^\\mu + \\text{h.c.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here it is supposed that the interaction lagrangian is linear in the rs field ; i.e. , the source @xmath28 depends only on external fields .",
    "the matrices in the kinetic and mass terms of the lagrangian are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an arbitrary complex parameter .",
    "evaluating the euler - lagrange equation for the lagrangian gives the rs equation @xmath31 \\psi^\\nu = j_\\mu.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    operating now on eq .   by @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", we obtain constraints    [ constraints ] @xmath34 @xmath35    where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .      for the free field ( @xmath38 )",
    "solving constraints with respect to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we get the requisite conditions eliminating 8 redundant dof : @xmath41 these conditions recast eq .   into the dirac form",
    "@xmath42    we therefore are led to a well - known conclusion that the free rs theory is derived from a one - parameter equivalent class of lagrangians .",
    "the free - field parameter @xmath14 is shifted to a value @xmath43 by a field transformation @xmath44 where tensor matrix @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 the transformation is usually referred to as the  point \" or  contact \" transformation .",
    "such transformations form a non - unitary symmetry group of the equivalent class of the free - field lagrangians with the product law @xmath47 it should be stressed again that we use the definition of point transformations _ without _ a simultaneous change of the free - field parameter @xmath48 . therefore , the equivalent class of the lagrangians is point invariant , while a lagrangian for any particular @xmath14 is not point invariant .    besides , the free massless rs field admits the gauge transformation @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "introducing interactions to the theory complicates the issue of lower - spin states , because interaction lagrangians could bring the components of the field into nontrivial mixing , therefore violating off - shell the equivalence of the theories with different values of the parameter @xmath14 , breaking free - field constraints , and making nonphysical lower - spin states contribute to the observables @xcite .",
    "the most obvious way to prevent such inconsistencies is to impose free - field intrinsic symmetries on the interaction lagrangian .",
    "indeed , as we can see from eqs .",
    ", the constraints in the general case of the interacting theory involve the operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 depending on external fields .",
    "however , the requirement of the gauge and point invariance of the interactions makes these operators be identically zero : @xmath53 hereby for the point- and gauge - invariant interactions the free - field constraints remain unaffected and the field equation remains to be the dirac equation for every vector component of the vector spinor field , @xmath54    it should be emphasized again that the requirements could be considered redundant from the mathematical point of view .",
    "it can be shown that requiring the interaction lagrangian to be invariant under the gauge transformation solely still leads to a correct number of dof present in the theory @xcite . indeed , for the gauge invariant interactions ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 , a field redefinition @xmath57 recasts the free - field lagrangian into the form",
    "@xmath58 while the constraints become @xmath59 .",
    "the lagrangian does not contain any new contact terms that could be associated with the interactions of the spurious lower - spin components of the field @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gauge - invariant interactions do exclude spin-@xmath61 dof .",
    "we choose , however , to amplify the symmetry of the interaction lagrangian by the point invariance suggested by peccei @xcite .",
    "the point invariance is an additional symmetry that constrains ambiguities in the definition of the gauge - invariant interaction lagrangian and corresponding form factors .",
    "for example , consider the first possible differential order of the gauge - invariant @xmath62 lagrangian for spin-3/2 resonance .",
    "it can contain at least two invariants @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "arbitrary linear combinations of the invariants could be used as terms of the lagrangian . for higher spins and higher derivatives ,",
    "the number of invariants increases dramatically . at this point",
    ", we have two possibilities .",
    "the first one is to choose some couplings `` by hand . ''",
    "the second one is to expand the symmetry so that to constrain the invariants .",
    "the most obvious additional symmetry for rs fields is the point invariance , and it does leave only one invariant , as we will see .",
    "in addition to providing unambiguous definition of the lagrangian and form factors , the point invariance leads to a classification of the form factors in line with the theory of the elastic form factors .",
    "the theory of the free massive rs fields @xmath19 for @xmath66 was constructed by singh and hagen in ref .",
    "@xcite . to get the necessary constraints , it relies on introducing lower - spin auxiliary fields in the lagrangian , which is mathematically inevitable for @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the singh - hagen lagrangians imply that the @xmath10 tracelessness of the field ( @xmath68 ) does not follow from the field equation , but is an _ a priori _ condition .",
    "in such a formulation the point invariance means that the lagrangian is invariant under all nonsingular linear transformations of the auxiliary fields .",
    "since the interaction source @xmath69 is a variational derivative of the interaction part of the action , the @xmath10 tracelessness of the source follows directly from the @xmath10 tracelessness of the field : @xmath70    it should be noted that at least for the spin-@xmath12 we can construct free - field theory in lines with the spin-@xmath11 theory , with @xmath10 tracelessness of the field following from the field equation @xcite . in this case , to get the condition , we should again require the invariance of the interaction lagrangian under the point transformations of the rs field : @xmath71    finally , in any case the constraint @xmath72 is guaranteed by the gauge invariance of the interaction lagrangian and the kinematic term of the free lagrangian : @xmath73",

    "they are given by taylor expansions in the momentum space or derivative expansions and in the configuration space .",
