    "recently , the topological properties have been investigated extensively in condensed matter systems such as topological insulators ( tis ) @xcite , topological superfluids ( tsfs)/superconductors ( tscs ) @xcite .",
    "tsfs / tscs have a full pairing gap in the bulk and gapless majorana edge states at the boundary .",
    "these new quantum phases are described by topological order @xcite instead of the traditional landau symmetry breaking theory .",
    "the gapless majorana edge states are protected by the symmetry of bulk for the bulk - edge correspondence . for the application ,",
    "the gapless majorana edge states have significant application in topological quantum computation and attract considerable attention @xcite . in two dimensions(2d ) , there are two classes of tsfs / tscs , namely the chiral superfluids / superconductors and helical superfluids / supconductors .",
    "chiral superfluids / supconductors break the time - reversal symmetry and have chiral majorana edge states at the boundary @xcite . whereas the helical superfluids / supconductors are time - reversal invariant ( tri ) and have gapless helical majorana edge states at the boundary @xcite .",
    "they are classified by an integer and a @xmath0 invariant respectively @xcite .",
    "the helical superfluid phase can be stabilized in a two - band spin - orbit coupled system@xcite or a bilayer system@xcite with soc and repulsive interlayer interaction .    in ultracold fermonic system , tis / tsfs",
    "are proposed to be realized by utilizing spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "most recently , the effective soc has been successfully realized both in ultracold bosonic @xcite and fermonic @xcite systems and has generated a considerable amount of theoretical interests @xcite . with remarkable tunability and clean environment @xcite , ultracold fermi gases provide an ideal platform for investigating the interesting topological properties . for a spin - polarized fermi gas , the chiral superfluid phases can be stabilized in the presence of spin - orbit coupling and exhibit many new interesting physics @xcite .",
    "however , the study of the helical superfluid phase are destitute in ultracold fermonic system . in addition",
    ", a bilayer fermionic system exhibits many new interesting phenomena @xcite compared to the singlelayer case . with a soc ,",
    "the bilayer fermionic system can stabilize the helical superfluid phase without breaking the time - reversal symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a spin - orbit coupled fermi gas loaded in a bilayer optical lattice by using a bcs - type mean field theory at zero temperature .",
    "the interlayer hopping is included instead of the interlayer interaction .",
    "the ground state is self - consistently determined by minimizing the thermodynamic potential . due to the degeneracies on the fermi surfaces , we investigate the topological properties of the superfluid phases by a nontrivial application of the fermi surface topological invariant ( fsti ) .",
    "our main results are the followings .",
    "first , the superfluid phases are all topological trivial in the phase diagram of half filling case while there is a first - order phase boundary .",
    "second , the superfluid phase is topological nontrivial when the filling fraction deviate from the half filling . without breaking the time - reversal symmetry ( trs )",
    ", the topological nontrivial superfluid phase is helical superfluid phase .",
    "this state has a full pairing gap in the bulk and gapless helical majorana edge states counterpropagating at the boundary . in the phase diagram of filling fraction ,",
    "there are two helical superfluid phases which are separated by a gapless boundary .",
    "there is no difference between the two helical superfluid phases in topology .",
    "lastly , the effect of the trapping potential is discussed under local density approximation .",
    "our work provides a possible route to realize the helical superfluid phase in ultracold fermionic system in the future .",
    "we consider a system of bilayer fermi gas of isotropic spin - orbit coupling . in the mean field framework ,",
    "the system s hamiltonian can be given as the following : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is kinetic term , @xmath3 is isotropic soc term and @xmath4 is s - wave pairing term .",
    "the following are their detail expression @xmath5,\\\\ & & h_{s}= -\\sum_{i } ( \\delta a_{i \\uparrow}^{\\dag } a_{i \\downarrow}^{\\dag }   - \\delta b_{i \\uparrow}^{\\dag } b_{i \\downarrow}^{\\dag } + h.c.).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here,@xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 denoting the fermion annihilation ( creation ) operators for @xmath9 and @xmath10 layers , respectively .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath11 act on the spin and @xmath12 acts on the layer , @xmath13 is the strength of interlayer hopping . in the above forms",
    ", we have assumed that there is a @xmath14 phase shift between the socs of the two layers , @xmath15 is the strength of the soc .",
    "we have also assumed @xmath16 @xcite with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the strength of the attractive on - site interaction .",
    "we only consider the intralayer on - site interaction and the interlayer hopping for simplicity .",
    "therefore , by introducing @xmath20 with fourier transformations @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the number of the sites of the lattices ) , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 where , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here , the hamiltonian of two dimension bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) possess the partical - hole symmetry ( phs ) and trs .",

    "the topological invariant properties will be discussed in the next section .",
    "rigorous topological invariants of interacting insulators and superfluids / superconductors defined in terms of topological hamiltonian , which is the inverse of zero frequency green s function @xmath39 , have been proposed in ref.@xcite recently . in the mean - field approximation and weakly pairing limit , we can also use the fsti given by qi .",
    "et al in ref.@xcite , which takes the following form @xmath40^{m_{i}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the number of tri points enclosed by the @xmath42th fermi surface , @xmath43 is the sign of pairing gap on the @xmath42th fermi surface of single particle hamiltonian @xmath44 with @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are the eigenvectors of @xmath44 and @xmath47 .",
    "the 2d tri superfluid phase is topological trivial for @xmath48 and nontrivial for @xmath49 .",
    "the fsti shows that the topological properties of a superfluid phase is completely determined by the fermi surface properties in weakly pairing limit . for our system",
    ", the pairing gap can be larger than the strength of the hopping(@xmath50 ) , thus the fsti is not well defined in these regions .",
    "even though the fsti can only be applied to the narrow superfluid region near the boundaries of the normal and superfluid phases , the information is adequate for determining the topological invariants of the superfluid phases in the phase diagrams because we expect that topological properties should be the same for the same phase .",
    "the eigenvalues of the single particle hamiltonian are @xmath51 which are with twofold degeneracy . for a system with degenerate fermi surfaces",
    ", the above fsti can not work and some perturbations should be introduced to lift the degeneracy while preserving the phs and tri symmetry of the system . to lift the degeneracy , we can introduce an imbalance in chemical potential @xmath52 of the two layers with @xmath53 , then the single particle hamiltonian changes into @xmath54 with pauli matrix @xmath55 act on the layer part , hence the four eigenvalues of the imbalanced hamiltonian @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) have no degeneracy and the fsti can work well .",
    "the sign of the pairing gap on the fermi surfaces is @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath63 ( more details are included in the appendix ) .     in the first brillouin zone with @xmath64 for @xmath65 , @xmath66 with ( a ) @xmath67 , ( b ) @xmath68 , ( c ) @xmath69 and ( d ) @xmath70 .",
    "the number of tri points enclosed by fermi surfaces is two for ( a ) , ( b ) and one for ( c),(d ) respectively.,width=245,height=245 ]    for @xmath63 , the imbalanced hamiltonian can not adiabatically changes into the balanced case by taking the limit @xmath71 , this indicates that there exists topological phase transitions as @xmath72 increasing . in this work ,",
    "we only concentrate on the balanced case and leave the imbalance case for future discussion .    for @xmath60",
    ", the imbalanced hamiltonian can be adiabatically changed into the balanced case by taking the limit @xmath71 without changing any topological properties , thus the sign of the pairing gap on the fermi surfaces for the balanced case is the same as the imbalanced case .",
    "such that the fsti only depends on the number of the tri points enclosed by the fermi surfaces of the @xmath73 .",
    "fig.[fig.1 ] shows the fermi surfaces of @xmath73 for various cases .",
    "the number of the tri points enclosed by the fermi surfaces is @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "according to analysis of the relationship between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 amounts to @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath74 for @xmath83 and @xmath76 for @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the superfluid phases are topological nontrivial when the interlayer hopping satisfies the topological condition @xmath84 in the weakly pairing limit .",
    "and @xmath13 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 . ( right)the phase diagram as a function of filling fraction @xmath87 and the interlayer hopping @xmath13 with @xmath85 and @xmath88 .",
    "the dotted curve represents the gapless boundary and the dashed - dotted curve represents first - order phase boundary .",
    "the dashed curve represents topological phase boundaries .",
    "the superfluid phases are all topological nontrivial for @xmath86 .",
    "there are two topological superfluid regions separated by a dotted curve when the filling fraction deviates from the half filling.,width=321,height=151 ]     in a strip geometry for ( a ) @xmath89 , @xmath90 and ( b ) @xmath91 , @xmath92 ( c ) @xmath93 , @xmath94 ( d ) @xmath89 , @xmath94 with @xmath85 and @xmath95.,width=321,height=245 ]    the topological phase transition only occurs at the gapless points with the changing of the topological invariants .",
    "thus , the gapless conditions show the significance of determining the topological invariants of the superfluid phases in the phase diagram .",
    "since the superfluid phases are topological trivial in the absence of interlayer hopping ( @xmath96 ) , the topological invariant of the superfluid phase near the boundaries between the normal and superfluid phases can be determined by the fsti .",
    "therefore , the topological invariants of all the superfluid phases in the phase diagram can be determined .",
    "first , we show the phase diagram as a function of on - site interaction ( @xmath19 ) and interlayer hopping ( @xmath13 ) for half filling case in fig.[fig.2](a ) .",
    "the dotted curve represents the gapless boundary and the dashed - dotted curve represents first - order phase boundary along which the thermodynamic potential has two degenerate minima . by analyzing the relationship between @xmath97 and @xmath13 along the boundary between the normal and the superfluid phases , we have @xmath98 for all the superfluid phase which indicates that there is no topological nontrivial superfluid phase for the half filling case .",
    "second , in order to find the topological nontrivial superfluid phase , we investigate the case as deviating from the half filling . as the system has particle - hole symmetry at half filling , the phase diagram has an axial symmetry .",
    "fig.[fig.2](b ) shows the phase diagram as a function of filling fraction ( @xmath87 ) and the interlayer hopping ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the dashed and the dotted curves represent the gapless boundaries along which the gapless points are @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) and @xmath101 $ ] for @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) respectively . therefore , the chemical potential and the interlayer hopping satisfy the topological condition @xmath84 at the superfluid side of the normal - superfluid boundary which is above the dashed curve . without the interlayer hopping ,",
    "the system can be considered as two independent so coupled fermi gases in which the superfluid phases are all topological trivial . as the interlayer hopping increases",
    ", there exists a topological phase transition when the filling fraction deviates from the half filling . as shown in fig.[fig.2](b ) , there are two tsf phases .",
    "the two tsf phases are helical superfluid phases and have no difference in topology .",
    "the only difference between the two helical superfluid phases is that the tri points enclosed by the fermi surfaces are different in the weakly pairing limit .    as mentioned before ,",
    "the tsf phases are also characterized by the gapless boundary modes . for a 2d tri tsf phase ,",
    "the boundary modes are gapless helical majorana edge states , where time - reversal partners counterpropagate .",
    "accordingly , each tri topological defect of the tsfs carries a kramers pair of majorana fermions . to investigate the helical majorana edge states , we calculate the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) in a strip geometry where the edges are along the @xmath104 direction . due to breaking of translation symmetry along the @xmath104 direction , @xmath105 is not a good quantum number while @xmath106 is a good quantum number , and then we perform a fourier transformation along the @xmath107 direction only .",
    "fig.[fig.3 ] show the spectrum of the hamiltonian as a function of @xmath106 for various @xmath97 and @xmath13 with @xmath66 and @xmath108 .",
    "fig.[fig.3](a ) and ( d ) are the cases of the @xmath109 while the fig.[fig.3](c ) is the case @xmath110 .",
    "the three phases have a full gap in the bulk and gapless helical majorana edge states counterpropagating at the boundary .",
    "fig.[fig.3](b ) is the half filling case and there are two pairs of gapless majorana edge states at the boundary , which indicates that the phase is topological trivial .    at last , we consider the effects of a weakly harmonic trapping potential under lda . in the presence of harmonic trapping potential ,",
    "the global chemical potential ( @xmath111 ) and the pairing gap are the functions of spatial coordinates .",
    "the topological invariants of the superfluid phases depend on the spatial coordinates .",
    "therefore , the helical superfluid phase and topological trivial phases ( normal phase and topological trivial superfluid phase ) can coexist in the trapped region and a shell structure of topological phase separation emerges@xcite .",
    "the helical majorana edge states , which can be called helical majorana liquid , exists at the interfaces of the helical superfluid phase and topological trivial phases .",
    "the position of the helical majorana liquid is controlled by the parameters of the system .",
    "the existence of the helical majorana liquid will lead to nontrivial physical consequences@xcite .",
    "in addition , we only consider the interlayer hopping and the intralayer on - site attractive interaction for simplicity . when the interlayer interaction is taken into account ,",
    "the phase diagram will be enriched .",
    "furthermore , the helical superfluid phase with unconventional pairing like the @xmath112 might be stabilized when the on - site interaction is replaced by the nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "to conclude , we have constructed the phase diagram for a bilayer spin - orbit coupled fermi gas loaded in a square optical lattice .",
    "we have found that the tri superfluid phases are topological nontrivial when the filling fraction deviates from the half filling .",
    "there are helical edge states at the boundary of the tri topological superfluid phase .",
    "in addition , we also have discussed the effects of a harmonic trapping potential .",
    "there is a shell structure of topological phase separation phenomena in the trapped region .",
    "we expect our work can provide a possible route to realize the helical superfluid phase by ultracold fermionic system in the future .",
