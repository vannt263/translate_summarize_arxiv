    "spin glasses have been one of the most prominent models for disordered systems since the classical paper by edwards and anderson @xcite .",
    "they are built from simple degrees of freedom interacting via random couplings @xcite .",
    "the ensuing interplay between disorder and frustration gives rise to peculiar static and dynamic properties which made spin - glasses paradigms for complex systems with competing interactions .",
    "the concepts and techniques developed for their theoretical understanding became useful also in the quantitative analysis of problems from algorithmic complexity @xcite , game theory @xcite , artificial neural networks @xcite , and cryptography @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of spin glasses is so far possible on the mean - field level only .",
    "different models of mean - field spin glasses have been introduced and analyzed over the years .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite was designed as generalization of the weiss model of ferromagnetism .",
    "it is the most popular completely connected spin glass model in which each spin interacts with all @xmath0 other spins via _ weak _ couplings @xmath1 .",
    "the central limit theorem can then be invoked to determine the statistical properties of the local fields and in the simplest situation the distribution of these fields is gaussian and can be characterized by a single scalar order parameter .",
    "the details of the spin glass transition and the intricate nature of the low - temperature phase of this model have been thoroughly elucidated within the framework of the celebrated parisi solution @xcite .",
    "quite recently the main features of this solution were established in a mathematically rigorous way @xcite .",
    "the variety of mean - field models for spin glasses is , however , by far not exhausted by sk - like systems .",
    "the viana - bray ( vb ) model @xcite and , more generally , spin glasses on finite - connectivity graphs @xcite combine finite coordination number with mean - field behaviour . here",
    "each spin interacts with a finite number of randomly selected other spins through _ strong _ bonds @xmath2 . accordingly",
    "the distribution of local fields is not gaussian and has to be characterized by all its moments .",
    "the analysis of these systems is therefore technically more involved and already in the simplest ( replica symmetric ) description infinitely many order parameters ( or equivalently an order parameter function ) have to be introduced .",
    "models of this type often arise in the analysis of complex optimization problems with methods from statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "> from the technical perspective two different methods were developed to analyze spin glasses within the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics . the replica method @xcite centers around averages of integer moments of the partition function of the system .",
    "its crucial step consists in the analytical continuation of the results for the @xmath3-th moment of the partition function from integer to real @xmath3 and the final limit @xmath4 .",
    "complementary , the cavity method @xcite builds on the clustering property of equilibrium states and the stability of the thermodynamic limit @xmath5 .",
    "here one considers a system with @xmath6 spins , adds one additional spin with its couplings to the system and derives self - consistency relations that stem from the fact that the statistical properties of the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 spin system should be similar to each other . both the sk and the vb model have been analyzed using the replica as well as the cavity method .    also from the numerical point of view , spin glasses are a challenging problem . due to the frustrated interactions and since",
    "no efficient cluster algorithm exists , it is very hard to equilibrate samples at temperatures below the transition temperature .",
    "hence , other schemes like parallel tempering are used frequently , but still sizes of the order of @xmath8 spins are typically the maximum system size one can treat .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the replica - symmetric ( rs ) theory of an infinite range spin - glass model for which the couplings strengths are drawn from a levy distribution @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of these distributions are power - law tails resulting in diverging moments .",
    "spin glasses with levy couplings are interesting for several reasons . in real spin glasses with a random distribution of magnetic atoms in a non - magnetic host lattice",
    "the rkky - interaction give rise to a broad spectrum of interaction strengths , in particular for low concentration of magnetic impurities .",
    "the coexistence of couplings with vastly different strength is badly represented by a gaussian distribution as used in the sk model .",
    "also , it is interesting to see whether the concept of frustration which is central to the understanding of spin glasses has to be modified for broad distributions of coupling strengths .",
    "moreover , in a completely connected spin glass with levy distributed couplings each spin will establish @xmath9 strong bonds with other spins whereas the majority of couplings are weak , i.e. tend to zero for @xmath10 .",
    "levy spin glasses are hence intermediate between the classes represented by the vb and sk model respectively and it is interesting to see how the spin glass transition is influenced by the percolation of the strong bonds on the one hand and the collective blocking of the many weak bonds on the other hand .",
    "levy spin glasses also pose new challenges to the theoretical analysis because the diverging second moment of the coupling distribution invalidates the central limit theorem which is at the bottom of many mean - field techniques .",
    "related issues of interest include quantum spin glasses with broad coupling distribution @xcite , the spectral theory of random matrices with levy - distributed entries @xcite , and relaxation and transport on scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the peculiar properties of levy distributions may facilitate mathematically rigorous investigations of spin glasses . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to note that the properties of the cauchy - distribution have recently enabled progress in the mathematically rigorous analysis of matrix games with random pay - off matrices @xcite .",
    "the levy spin glass was investigated previously by cizeau and bouchaud using the cavity method @xcite .",
    "complementary , our main emphasis will be on the application of the replica method to the levy spin glass .",
    "as noted also by cizeau and bouchaud a straightforward implementation of the classical version of the replica method for infinite range models @xcite is impractical due to diverging order parameters .",
    "it is , however , possible to use a variant of the replica method that was developed to deal with non - gaussian local field distributions characteristic for diluted spin glasses and complex optimization problems @xcite . until now this approach was used only in situations where the local field distribution is inadequately characterized by its second moment alone and higher moments of the distribution are needed for a complete description .",
    "here we show that the method may also be adapted to situations where the moments may not even exist .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the precise definition of the model in the next section we recall in section [ cavity ] the main steps of the rs cavity treatment performed by cizeau and bouchaud .",
    "section [ replica ] comprises our replica analysis including the results for the spin glass transition temperature and the influence of a ferromagnetic bias in the coupling distribution . in section [ numerics ]",
    "we describe our numerical simulations and compare their results for the transition temperature with our analytical findings .",
    "finally , section [ discussion ] gives a short discussion of the results and points out some open problems .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath6 ising spins @xmath11 with hamiltonian @xmath12 where the sum is over all pairs of spins .",
    "the couplings @xmath13 are independent , identically distributed random variables drawn from a symmetric levy distribution @xmath14 .",
    "it is defined by its characteristic function @xcite @xmath15 with the real parameter @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "a gaussian distribution of couplings as in the standard sk model is obtained in the limit @xmath18 .",
    "levy distributions are stable distributions which roughly means the following .",
    "if @xmath19 are independent random variables drawn from a levy distribution @xmath20 their sum , @xmath21 , is distributed according to @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 is also levy distributed with the same parameter @xmath16 , albeit with a width increased by a factor @xmath24 . correspondingly the exchange fields @xmath25 in a levy spin glass are levy distributed and the scaling of the couplings with @xmath26 ensures that they are of order  1 for @xmath5 such that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) is extensive .",
    "> from the definition ( [ eq : defp ] ) we also find the asymptotic form of @xmath27 for large @xmath28 to be @xmath29 from this asymptotic behaviour and the interval of admissible values of @xmath16 it is clear that the second and higher moments of levy distributions do not exist .",
    "the long tail of the distribution also implies that the largest among @xmath6 independent levy variables is of order @xmath24 , i.e. of exactly the same order as their sum .",
    "the sum is hence dominated by its largest summands .",
    "each spin in a levy spin glass is therefore coupled to the majority of other spins by weak couplings of order @xmath26 and to a few ( @xmath30 for @xmath5 ) by strong bonds of order  1 .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the system are described by the ensemble averaged free energy @xmath31 with the partition function @xmath32 here @xmath33 denotes the inverse temperature and the overbar stands for the average over the random couplings @xmath34 .",
    "the first statistical mechanics analysis of the levy spin glass was performed 15 years ago by cizeau and bouchaud @xcite using a variant of the cavity method . in the traditional form of the cavity method for fully connected systems @xcite",
    "one considers a system of @xmath6 spins @xmath35 in a pure equilibrium state and adds @xmath6 new couplings @xmath36 between these existing spins and a _ cavity _ which will later accommodate the @xmath37-st spin @xmath38 .",
    "for both the couplings @xmath34 in the @xmath6-spin system and for the new couplings one particular realization is considered . the exchange field ( [ eq : defhex ] ) in the cavity @xmath39 is then a random variable due to the thermal fluctuations of the @xmath40 .",
    "the clustering property of pure states of an equilibrium system ensures that the connected correlation functions of the spins tend to zero for @xmath5 @xcite and therefore @xmath41 is a sum over many , asymptotically independent random variables .",
    "if all @xmath42 are of the same order of magnitude this implies a gaussian distribution of the cavity field uniquely characterized by its variance .",
    "further manipulations generate a self - consistent equation for this variance from which all replica symmetric properties of the system may be derived .    in the case of a levy spin glass",
    ", however , a typical realization of the couplings @xmath42 contains a few very large bonds .",
    "this invalidates the central limit theorem ( the lindeberg criterion is not fulfilled , see @xcite ) and the cavity field distribution is not gaussian .",
    "the traditional form of the cavity method for infinite range models is hence not applicable to the levy spin glass .",
    "as observed by cizeau and bouchaud it is however possible to employ a variant of the cavity method as later used also in the analysis of spin systems on locally tree - like graphs @xcite which is known to physicist as bethe - peierls approximation @xcite and to computer scientists as _ belief propagation _ @xcite .",
    "this method builds on the fact that with @xmath40 being a binary quantity its marginal probability distribution @xmath43 can be parametrized by a single variable which we take to be the _ local _ field @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 accordingly we find @xmath46 as well as @xmath47 the local field must not be confused with the exchange field ( [ eq : defhex ] ) . unlike the latter it is not thermally fluctuating .",
    "if the cavity distribution is gaussian the thermal average of the exchange field coincides with the local field @xcite .",
    "however , in the general case and in particular for the levy spin glass this does not hold .",
    "for the marginal distribution of the new spin @xmath38 we have @xmath48 as well as @xmath49 using the clustering property in the form @xmath50 a straightforward calculation yields @xmath51 as observed by cizeau and bouchaud one may be tempted to expand in the argument of the second @xmath52 for @xmath5 to find the familiar expression @xmath53 however , this would be unjustified since some of the @xmath54 are not small .",
    "the local field @xmath55 as given by ( [ eq : resh_0 ] ) is a random quantity both due to its dependence on the old couplings @xmath34 determining the @xmath44 and on the new couplings @xmath42 . as long as @xmath56 the non - linearity in ( [ eq : resh_0 ] ) suppresses the influence of the few large @xmath42 . as a consequence",
    "the second moment of the local field distribution @xmath57 exists : @xmath58 cizeau and bouchaud therefore argue that the central limit theorem may be applied and that @xmath57 is gaussian @xcite . using translational invariance of the ensemble averaged system ( [ h1 ] ) may then be written as a self - consistent condition for @xmath59 . using ( [ eq : defp ] ) this equation acquires the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a numerical constant .    solving ( [ eq : saddleq ] ) numerically one obtains @xmath62 from which the free energy and all thermodynamics properties may be derived .",
    "in particular one easily verifies that the paramagnetic state with @xmath63 is always a solution .",
    "it is stable for small @xmath33 and looses its stability at @xmath64 given by @xmath65",
    "within the replica approach we employ the replica trick @xcite to calculate the average in ( [ eq : deff ] ) , @xmath66 as usual we aim at calculating @xmath67 for integer @xmath3 by replicating the system @xmath3 times , @xmath68 , and then try to continue the results to real @xmath3 in order to eventually perform the limit @xmath4 .    according to ( [ eq : h ] ) and ( [ eq : defz ] ) the partition function is a sum of exponential terms with the exponents linear in the couplings @xmath34 . due to the algebraic decay @xmath69 of the distribution @xmath14 for large @xmath28 the average @xmath70 hence diverges for real @xmath33 and we can not proceed in the usual way .    on the other hand , for a purely imaginary temperature , @xmath71",
    ", we find from the very definition of @xmath14 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : defp ] ) @xmath72 note that the scaling of the interaction strengths with @xmath6 used in ( [ eq : h ] ) makes the replica hamiltonian extensive as it should be .    as characteristic for a mean - field system the determination of @xmath67 can now be reduced to an effective single site problem . to this end",
    "we use the notation @xmath73 for a spin vector with @xmath3 components .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce the variables @xmath74 describing the fraction of lattice sites that share one out of the @xmath75 realizations of the spin vector @xmath76 @xcite .",

    "the corresponding self - consistent equation determining the saddle - point values @xmath83 of the @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 where the lagrange parameter @xmath86 enforces the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) .",
    "within the replica symmetric approximation one assumes that the solution of ( [ eq : saddle ] ) is symmetric under permutations of the replica indices .",

    "the percolation temperature is always lower than the spin - glass temperature as expected since a percolating backbone of strong bonds is incompatible with a paramagnetic phase . on the other hand the two temperatures",
    "never coincide which means that also the many weak bonds contribute significantly to the spin - glass transition in levy spin glasses .",
    "the transition is therefore not a pure percolation transitions . as can be seen from fig .",

    "guided by the analytical result ( [ eq : defc ] ) for @xmath187 and @xmath188 we chose in both cases 19 temperatures in the range @xmath207 $ ] . the temperatures @xmath208 are determined such that for the largest system size @xmath184 the average acceptance rate of the exchange steps is at least 0.5 for all pairs of neighboring temperatures . for all system sizes , the same set of temperatures is used , which allows for a better comparison of the results .    at the beginning of the simulation",
    "all configurations are random .",
    "we equilibrate the system until the squared overlap @xmath209 as a function of time , averaged over the last half of the simulation , has become independent of the number of monte carlo sweeps for all temperatures .",
    "furthermore , we verify that the distribution of overlaps measured during this period is symmetric with respect to @xmath210 . for the case @xmath211 ,",
    "we have additionally employed the equilibration criterion from @xcite and verified that the above listed criteria are compatible with it .",
    "after equilibration , spin configurations are stored for later analysis at all temperatures every @xmath212 monte carlo sweeps .",
    "@xmath212 is chosen such that it corresponds to the typical time one configuration needs to walk in temperature space from the lowest temperature @xmath155 to the highest @xmath213 and back to @xmath155 .",
    "since at the highest temperature , well above the phase transition temperature , the configurations forget their history at low temperatures , the stored configurations are statistically independent .",
    "typical values for @xmath212 range from @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) to @xmath216 ( @xmath184 ) . for each realization , we sample 1000 configurations and average for each system size over 1000 realizations .",
    "the results for @xmath129 obtained in this way are compatible with the theoretical result as shown in fig .",
    "infinite - range spin glasses with levy - distributed couplings are interesting examples of disordered systems . due to the long tails in the distribution of coupling strengths they interpolate between systems with many weak couplings per spin as the sherrington - kirkpatrick model and systems with few strong couplings per spin as the viana - bray model .",
    "the broad variations in coupling strengths brought about by the power - law tails in the levy distribution violate the lindeberg condition for the application of the central limit theorem and give rise to non - gaussian cavity field distributions with diverging moments . in the present paper",
    "we have shown that it is nevertheless possible to derive the replica symmetric properties of the system in a compact way by using the replica method as developed for the treatment of strongly diluted spin glasses and optimization problems @xcite .",
    "this approach focuses from the start on the complete distribution of fields rather than on its moments .",
    "the central result of our analysis is the self - consistent equation for the distribution of local fields , @xmath90 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : resrs ] ) . from this equation",
    "the expression ( [ eq : t_c ] ) for the critical temperature of the spin glass transition may be derived . in levy spin glasses",
    "there is for all temperatures a fraction of strong bonds per site which can not be broken thermally .",
    "comparison of the spin - glass transition temperature with the temperature at which these strong bonds start to percolate through the system reveals that the spin - glass transition in a levy glass is not a pure percolation transition . the contribution of the many weak couplings can not be neglected and becomes increasingly important as the parameter @xmath16 in the levy distribution approaches the limit @xmath217 corresponding to the sk model .",
    "our results show similarities and differences with those of the cavity analysis of cizeau and bouchaud @xcite .",
    "the results for the critical temperature are the same because the expressions for the second moment of the local field distribution coincide .",
    "however , we do not find a gaussian distribution of local fields for @xmath218 as assumed by cizeau and bouchaud on the basis of the cavity expression ( [ eq : resh_0 ] ) . from the numerical solution of tap equations for the sk model",
    "it is known that for all @xmath218 a certain fraction of local magnetizations @xmath219 are extremely near to 1 @xcite .",
    "as this seems likely to be the case in levy spin glasses as well it is conceivable that the distribution of @xmath44 in ( [ eq : resh_0 ] ) is such that the lindeberg criterion is again violated and that the central limit theorem may not be applicable .",
    "several open questions may be addressed in forthcoming work in order to completely characterize the properties of levy spin glasses .",
    "first the self - consistent equation for @xmath90 should be solved , either numerically or analytically in limiting cases .",
    "building on these results the replica symmetric picture of the low - temperature phase may be completed and compared with the findings from the cavity approach . since",
    "replica symmetry is certainly broken at low temperature a stability analysis of the rs saddle point ( [ eq : saddle ] ) needs to be performed and it is to be checked whether the dealmeida - thouless temperature @xmath220 is indeed smaller than @xmath129 as found within the cavity approach .",
    "finally the structure of the solution with broken replica symmetry is to be elucidated . within the replica approach adopted in the present paper",
    "this is known to be very complicated such that for this task a cavity analysis looks more promising .",
    "finally , improved numerical simulations will contribute to a better understanding of the intricate properties of levy spin glasses .",
    "we would like to thank timo aspelmeier , daniel grieser , rmi monasson and martin weigt for clarifying discussions .",
