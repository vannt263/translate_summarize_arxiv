    "we transform into a wannier - stark basis which is diagonal along the floquet direction , and analyze the resulting eigenvalue problem . for large driving frequencies",
    "the equations reduce to uncoupled single channel ones , which are essentially equivalent to the undriven case . for small driving frequencies we obtain a multi - channel regime with a substantial increase of the localization length , and its divergence in the limit of vanishing frequency .",

    "it follows that for @xmath106 and @xmath72 we can trace a path in eq.([eq : am_newform ] ) where the onsite mismatch is of the order of the frequency @xmath107 and the hopping scales with the square root of the frequency @xmath108 for every @xmath32 .",
    "we call this the _ optimal path_. the optimal path is a one dimensional random walk within the two dimensional network . along that optimal path",

    "furthermore , paths neighboring the optimal one , are also strong links , as long as the energy detuning is not exceeding the matrix element . since the matrix element scales with @xmath111 , the number of strong links diverges as @xmath112 . using the dorokhov estimates ,",
    "we conclude that the localization length on the network is scaling as @xmath113 therefore the localization length diverges for vanishing frequency faster than in the weak driving case .",
    "the presence of random phases will suppress the optimal path through an increase of the minimal value of the driving strength :",
    "@xmath114    where @xmath115 .",

    "therefore , for uncorrelated phases @xmath16 , the square root term of eq.([eq : mu>1 general equivalent ] ) can be arbitrarily close to zero if @xmath119 and @xmath120 . as a consequence , @xmath84 has to diverge to infinity in order to satisfy eq.([eq : mu>1 general equivalent ] ) at every step @xmath32 and so , for given finite values of the driving strength , the optimal path is interrupted .",
    "this will lead to a slower divergence of the localization length , which however is still expected to be faster than in the weak driving regime , since there will be finite volume parts in which the optimal path will survive",
    ".      since @xmath6 and @xmath16 are random phases , the square root term of eq.([eq : sqrt_rphases ] ) can be arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "therefore , even deep in the multi - channel regime @xmath121 , there might exist one or more lattice sites @xmath32 such that the bessel function argument @xmath122 .",
    "in that case , the hopping @xmath123 as in the single channel regime . as a result , the multi - channel regime between site @xmath32 and @xmath118 becomes locally suppressed .    in the case of constant phases",
    "@xmath105 , this local suppression appears if @xmath124.the single channel then still shows an energy difference of the order of @xmath33 or less , similar to the optimal path .",

    ".    the previously obtained estimates on the localization length @xmath2 in either weak and strong driving regimes are therefore upper bounds .",
    "for the general case of eq.([eq : multicolor ] ) , the floquet expansion in the momentum space and the rotation of the eigenvalue problem in a basis of bessel functions for each frequency is a natural generalization of what we have previously described in sec.[sect : d=1 ] for one color @xmath4 ( see appendix ) . since",

    ". each frequency color will add to the total number of channels .",
    "let us assume that all frequency components satisfy the same condition for single or multi - channel ( either strong or weak driving ) regimes .",
    "then we conclude that the single channel regime will be applicable to multi - color driving as well , i.e. in the limit of large frequencies localization length corresponds to its value from the undriven case . in the multi - channel regime , using the above argument of dorokhov , the localization length @xmath142 will be of the order of @xmath143 with @xmath2 being the corresponding single color localization length discussed in the previous section .",
