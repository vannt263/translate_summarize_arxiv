    "the kinematics of lepton hadron scattering is described in terms of the variables @xmath0 , the invariant mass of the exchanged vector boson , bjorken @xmath1 , the fraction of the momentum of the incoming nucleon taken by the struck quark ( in the quark - parton model ) , and @xmath2 which measures the energy transfer between the lepton and hadron systems .",

    "the structure functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are directly related to quark distributions , and their @xmath0 dependence , or scaling violation , is predicted by pqcd . for low @xmath1 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 is sea quark dominated , but its @xmath0 evolution is controlled by the gluon contribution , such that hera data provide crucial information on low-@xmath1 sea - quark and gluon distributions . at high @xmath0 ,",
    "the structure function @xmath6 becomes increasingly important , and gives information on valence quark distributions .",
    "the charged current ( cc ) interactions also enable us to separate the flavour of the valence distributions at high-@xmath1 , since their ( lo ) cross - sections are given by , @xmath8,\\ ] ] @xmath9.\\ ] ]    parton density function ( pdf ) determinations are usually global fits  @xcite , which use fixed target dis data as well as hera data .",
    "in such analyses , the high statistics hera nc @xmath10 data have determined the low-@xmath1 sea and gluon distributions , whereas the fixed target data have determined the valence distributions .",
    "now that high-@xmath0 hera data on nc and cc @xmath10 and @xmath11 inclusive double differential cross - sections are available , pdf fits can be made to hera data alone , since the hera high @xmath0 cross - section data can be used to determine the valence distributions .",
    "this has the advantage that it eliminates the need for heavy target corrections , which must be applied to the @xmath12-fe and @xmath13 fixed target data .",
    "furthermore there is no need to assume isospin symmetry , i.e. that @xmath14 in the proton is the same as @xmath15 in the neutron , since the @xmath14 distribution can be obtained directly from cc @xmath10 data .",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations have both used their data to make pdf fits  @xcite . in section  [ sec : compare ] we review the published pdf analyses paying particular attention to the treatment of correlated systematic errors . in section  [ sec : combine ] we present the preliminary results of a combination of zeus and h1 data . in section  [ sec : jets ] we discuss the improvement in our knowledge of the gluon pdf , which comes from the addition of jet data to the pdf fits , and we present the measurements of @xmath16 which have been made using hera jet data . in section  [ sec : heraii ] we present preliminary fits using hera - ii data and in section  [ sec : future ] we conclude by looking at the propsects for the future .",
    "full details of the analyses are given in the relevant publications , in this contribution we examine the differences in the two analyses , recapping only salient details .",
    "for both hera analyses the qcd predictions for the structure functions are obtained by solving the dglap evolution equations  @xcite at nlo in the  scheme with the renormalisation and factorization scales chosen to be @xmath0 .",
    "these equations yield the pdfs at all values of @xmath0 provided they are input as functions of @xmath1 at some input scale @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting pdfs are then convoluted with coefficient functions , to give the structure functions which enter into the expressions for the cross - sections . for the zeus analysis",

    "the zero - mass variable flavour number scheme is used .",
    "the hera data are all in a kinematic region where there is no sensitivity to target mass and higher twist contributions , but a minimum @xmath0 cut must be imposed to remain in the kinematic region where perturbative qcd should be applicable . for zeus this is @xmath18  gev@xmath19 , and for h1 it is @xmath20  gev@xmath19 .",

    "the flavour structure of the light quark sea allows for the violation of the gottfried sum rule . however , there is no information on the shape of the @xmath33 distribution in a fit to hera data alone and so this distribution has its shape fixed consistent with the drell - yan data and its normalisation consistent with the size of the gottfried sum - rule violation",
    ". a suppression of the strange sea with respect to the non - strange sea of a factor of 2 at @xmath17 , is also imposed consistent with neutrino induced dimuon data from ccfr .",
    "parameters are further restricted as follows .",
    "the normalisation parameters , @xmath34 , for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 valence and for the gluon are constrained to impose the number sum - rules and momentum sum - rule .",

    "sec : jets ] .",
    "finally the zeus analysis has 11 free pdf parameters .",
    "zeus have included reasonable variations of these assumptions about the input parametrization in their analysis of model uncertainties .",

    "the normalisation , @xmath34 , of the gluon is determined from the momentum sum - rule and the @xmath52 parameters for @xmath49 and @xmath47 are determined from the valence number sum - rules .",
    "assuming that the strange and charm quark distributions can be expressed as @xmath1 independent fractions , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 type sea , gives the further constraint @xmath55 .",
    "finally there are 10 free parameters .",
    "h1 have also included reasonable variations of these assumptions in their analysis of model uncertainties .",
    "the strong coupling constant was fixed to @xmath56 and this is sufficiently similar to the zeus choice that we can rule it out as a cause of any significant difference .",
    "full account has been taken of correlated experimental systematic errors by the hessian method , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the different treatments of correlated experimental systematic errors deserves a little more dicussion since modern deep inelastic scattering experiments have very small statistical uncertainties , so that the contribution of systematic uncertainties becomes dominant and consideration of point to point correlations between systematic uncertainties is essential .    for both zeus and h1 analyses the formulation of the @xmath57 including correlated systematic uncertainties",
    "is constructed as follows .",
    "the correlated uncertainties are included in the theoretical prediction , @xmath58 , such that @xmath59 where , @xmath60 , represents the prediction from nlo qcd in terms of the theoretical parameters @xmath61 , and the parameters @xmath62 represent independent variables for each source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "they have zero mean and unit variance by construction .",
    "the symbol @xmath63 represents the one standard deviation correlated systematic error on data point @xmath64 due to correlated error source @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath57 is then formulated as @xmath66 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2 } + \\sum_\\lambda s^2_\\lambda   \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] where , @xmath67 , represents a measured data point and the symbol @xmath68 represents the one standard deviation uncorrelated error on data point @xmath64 , from both statistical and systematic sources .",
    "the experiments use this @xmath57 in different ways .",
    "zeus uses the offset method and h1 uses the hessian method .",
    "traditionally , experimentalists have used ` offset ' methods to account for correlated systematic errors .",
    "the @xmath57 is formulated without any terms due to correlated systematic errors ( @xmath69 in eq .",
    "[ eq : chi2 ] ) for evaluation of the central values of the fit parameters .",
    "however , the data points are then offset to account for each source of systematic error in turn ( i.e. set @xmath70 and then @xmath71 for each source @xmath65 ) and a new fit is performed for each of these variations .",
    "the resulting deviations of the theoretical parameters from their central values are added in quadrature .",
    "( positive and negative deviations are added in quadrature separately . )",
    "this procedure gives fitted theoretical predictions which are as close as possible to the central values of the published data .",
    "it does not use the full statistical power of the fit to improve the estimates of @xmath62 , and thus it is a more conservative method of error estimation than the hessian method .",
    "the hessian method is an alternative procedure in which the systematic uncertainty parameters @xmath62 are allowed to vary in the main fit when determining the values of the theoretical parameters .",
    "effectively , the theoretical prediction is not fitted to the central values of the published experimental data , but these data points are allowed to move collectively , according to their correlated systematic uncertainties .",
    "the theoretical prediction determines the optimal settings for correlated systematic shifts of experimental data points such that the most consistent fit to all data sets is obtained .",
    "thus , in a global fit , systematic shifts in one experiment are correlated to those in another experiment by the fit . in essence one",
    "is allowing the theory to calibrate the detectors .",
    "this requires confidence in the theory , but more significantly , it requires confidence in the many model choices ( such as the parametrization at @xmath17 ) which go into setting the boundary conditions for the theory .    to compare these two methods",
    "the zeus analysis has been performed using the hessian method as well as the offset method and fig .",
    "[ fig : offhess ] compares the pdfs , and their uncertainties , using these two methods .",
    "the central values of the different methods are in good agreement but the use of the hessian method results in smaller uncertainties , for a the standard set of model assumptions . however , model uncertainties are more significant for the hessian method than for the offset method . the pdf parameters obtained for",
    "different model choices can differ by much more than their experimental uncertainties , because each model choice can result in somewhat different values of the systematic uncertainty parameters , @xmath62 , and thus a different estimate of the shifted positions of the data points .",
    "this results in a larger spread of model uncertainty than is found in the offset method , for which the data points can not move .",
    "thus when the total uncertainty from both experimental and model sources is computed there is no great difference between these two aproaches .    fig .",
    "[ fig : h1zeus ] compares the results of the h1 and zeus analyses and illustrates the comparability of the zeus ( offset ) total uncertainty estimate to the h1 ( hessian ) experimental plus model uncertainty estimate .",
    "whereas the extracted pdfs are broadly compatible within errors , there is a noticeable difference in the shape of the gluon pdfs .",
    "this can be traced to small but significant differences in the @xmath0 slope of low-@xmath0 data .",
    "thus there could be an advantage in combining zeus and h1 data into a single data set  @xcite , not just in terms of reducing statistical errors , but also in reducing systematic errors by using each experiment to calibrate the other .",
    "essentially , since zeus and h1 are measuring the same physics in the same kinematic region , one can try to combine them using a theory - free hessian fit in which the only assumption is that there is a true value of the cross - section , for each process , at each @xmath72 point .",
    "the systematic uncertainty parameters , @xmath62 , of each experiment are fitted to determine the best fit to this assumption .",
    "thus each experiment is calibrated to the other .",
    "this works well because the sources of systematic uncertainty in each experiment are rather different .",
    "once the procedure has been performed the resulting systematic uncertainties on each of the combined data points are significantly smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "[ fig : hera ] shows the nc @xmath10 reduced cross - sections from the hera combination and compares the individual h1 and zeus results with those of the combination so that the scale of the improvement can be appreciated ..",
    "the gluon pdf contributes only indirectly to the inclusive dis cross sections , through the scaling violations .",
    "however it makes a direct contribution to jet cross sections through boson - gluon and quark - gluon scattering , so that measurements of these cross sections can constrain the gluon density .",
    "furthermore , the addition of the jet production data allows an accurate determination of @xmath74 to be made in a simultaneous fit for @xmath74 and the pdf parameters .    in the zeus - jets pdf fit ,",
    "zeus neutral current @xmath10 dis inclusive jet cross sections and direct photoproduction dijet cross sections have been used to constrain the gluon .",
    "the predictions for the jet cross sections were calculated to nlo in qcd using the programme of frixione and ridolfi  @xcite for photoproduced dijets and disent  @xcite for jet production in dis .",
    "these calculations are too slow to be used iteratively in the fit .",
    "thus , they were used to compute lo and nlo weights , @xmath75 , which are independent of @xmath16 and the pdfs , and are obtained by integrating the corresponding partonic hard cross sections in bins of @xmath76 ( the proton momentum fraction carried by the incoming parton ) , @xmath77 ( the factorisation scale ) and @xmath78 ( the renormalisation scale ) .",
    "the predictions for the nlo qcd cross sections are then obtained by folding these weights with the pdfs and @xmath16 according to the formula @xmath79 where the three sums run over the order @xmath80 in @xmath16 , the flavour @xmath81 of the incoming parton , and the indices ( @xmath82 ) of the @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 bins , respectively .",
    "this procedure reproduces the nlo predictions to better than @xmath83 .",
    "the cross - section predictions for photoproduced jets are sensitive to the choice of the input photon pdfs .",
    "the afg photon pdf  @xcite was used in the fits , but in order to minimise sensitivity to this choice , the analysis was restricted to use only the ` direct ' photoproduction cross sections .",
    "these are defined by the cut @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a measure of the fraction of the photon s momentum that enters into the hard scatter .",
    "fig  [ fig : jets ] shows that the jet data constrain the gluon mainly in the range @xmath86 , although the momentum sum - rule ensures that the indirect constraint of these data is still significant at higher @xmath1 .",
    "the decrease in the uncertainty on the gluon distribution is striking ; for example at @xmath87  gev@xmath19 and @xmath88 the uncertainty is reduced from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "a similar decrease in uncertainty by a factor of about two is found in this mid-@xmath1 range , over the full @xmath0 range .",
    "the value of @xmath74 is fixed in most pdf fits but a simultaneous fit for @xmath74 and the pdf parameters can be made .",
    "such fits to inclusive cross - section data do not yield accurate values of @xmath74 because of the strong correlation between @xmath74 and the gluon shape which comes from the dglap equations . however including jet data in the fit",
    "provides additional constraints . in the zeus - jets fit with free @xmath74 the value @xmath91 is obtained .",
    "figure  [ fig : chiprof ] illustrates the improved accuracy of the extraction of @xmath74 due to the inclusion of the jet data .",
    "the @xmath57 profile around the minimum is shown as a function of @xmath74 for the zeus - jets fit with @xmath16 free , and a similar fit in which the jet data are not included",
    ".    there have also been accurate determinations of @xmath74 using hera jet data independent of pdf fits and a combined zeus and h1 @xmath74 extraction has been made  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : heraalf ] compares this combined value to those of the individual experiments and to the world average , and also illustrates the running of @xmath16 with @xmath0 as determined from the hera experiments .",
    "the determinations of the valence pdfs from hera - i data are not as accurate as those from global fits , but this is rapidly improving with the addition of hera - ii data .",
    "fig  [ fig : zeuspol ] shows zeus @xmath11 nc data from the 2004 - 6 running period with polarised beams .",
    "there are @xmath92 of negatively polarised , @xmath93 , data and @xmath94 of positively polarised , @xmath95 , data .",
    "this data , and @xmath11 cc data from 2004 - 5 , have been input to the zeus - jets fit analysis framework and this new fit is called the zeus - pol fit  @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the data has been exploited to measure the neutral current vector and axial vector couplings  @xcite .",
    "the results of this zeus - pol fit are superimposed on the data in fig  [ fig : zeuspol ] .",
    "the pdfs extracted from the zeus - pol fit are compared to those of the zeus - jets fit in fig  [ fig : zppdf ] .",
    "the central values of the fit are very compatible with the zeus - jets fit , and the @xmath15-valence quark uncertainty is reduced significantly at large @xmath1 .",
    "the improvement is mostly in the @xmath15-valence quark at present because the @xmath11 data are @xmath15 quark dominated at large @xmath1 .",
    "we can expect improvements in the @xmath14-valence distribution when the final @xmath10 cc hera - ii data become available .",
    "we conclude with a look to the future .",
    "hera data will continue to improve our knowledge of pdfs for the next few years .",
    "firstly , there is more jet data both from hera - i  @xcite and from @xmath96 of hera - ii  @xcite analyses , as shown in fig  [ fig : morejets ] . inputting these data",
    "should improve determinations of the high-@xmath1 gluon .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the low-@xmath1 gluon , where the theoretical formalism of the nlo dglap equations may need extending to account for @xmath97 resummation  @xcite or even non - linear terms  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : jets ] shows the gluon and the sea pdfs predicted by the zeus - jets fit . for @xmath98gev@xmath19",
    "the gluon pdf is larger than and steeper than the sea pdf , but for lower @xmath0 it flattens and even becomes valence - like .",
    "this counter intuitive behaviour may come from the use of the dglap equations outside their region of applicability . at low @xmath1",
    "the form of the dglap equations is such that one has @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the determination of the gluon distribution is coming from the measurement of the scaling violations , @xmath101 , but these may be determined by either the gluon density or the splitting function .",
    "thus the odd behaviour of the gluon may in fact derive from use of an incorrect splitting function .",
    "the use of a calculation of the low-@xmath1 splitting functions which includes @xmath97 resummation results in a steeper gluon pdf  @xcite . to settle these ambiguities",
    "definitively we need a measurement of the gluon density at small @xmath1 which does not derive from the scaling violations of @xmath5 , for example a measurement of @xmath102 or @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "so far the addition of charm data to pdf fits has made little impact  @xcite but there is new data on @xmath105 from zeus , using @xmath106 production from @xmath107 of hera - i running  @xcite , and using @xmath108 ( and @xmath106 ) production from @xmath109  @xcite ( and @xmath110  @xcite ) of hera - ii running .",
