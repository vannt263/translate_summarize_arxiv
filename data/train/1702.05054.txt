    "<S> our analytical method shows that the presence of network dynamics boosts the prevalence ( and decreases the epidemic threshold @xmath60 ) when the concurrency @xmath7 is large and suppresses the prevalence ( and increases @xmath60 ) when @xmath7 is small , for a range of values of the network dynamic timescale @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this result lends theoretical support to previous claims that concurrency boosts epidemic spreading  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result may sound unsurprising because a large @xmath7 value implies that their exists a large connected component at any given time . </S>",
    "<S> however , our finding is not trivial because a large component consumes many edges such that other parts of the network at the same time or the network at other times would be more sparsely connected as compared to the case of a small @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm that monogamous sexual relationship or a small group of people chatting face - to - face , as opposed to polygamous relationships or large groups of conversations , hinders epidemic spreading , where we compare like with like by constraining the aggregate ( static ) network to be the same in all cases . for general temporal networks , immunization strategies that decrease </S>",
    "<S> concurrency ( e.g. , discouraging polygamy ) may be efficient . restricting the size of the concurrent connected component ( e.g. , size of a conversation group ) may also be a practical strategy .    </S>",
    "<S> another important contribution of the present study is the observation that infection dies out for a sufficiently large @xmath6 , regardless of the level of concurrency . as shown in figs .  3 and s1 , </S>",
    "<S> the transition to the `` die out '' </S>",
    "<S> phase occurs at values of @xmath6 that correspond to network dynamics and epidemic dynamics having comparable timescales . </S>",
    "<S> this is a stochastic effect and can not be captured by existing approaches to epidemic processes on temporal networks that neglect stochastic dying out , such as differential equation systems for pair formulation - dissolution models  @xcite and individual - based approximations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis methods explicitly consider such stochastic effects , and are therefore expected to be useful beyond the activity - driven model ( or the clique - based temporal networks analyzed in the supplemental material ) and the sis model .    </S>",
