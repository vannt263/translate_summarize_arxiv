    "below , we highlight some of the important effects of gas cooling and star formation on the properties of galaxy clusters :    * gas cooling induces condensation of gas in the cluster core region ( @xmath2kpc ) , and the baryon mass in the cluster core at @xmath3 is dominated by the stars associated with the central galaxy . *",
    "the condensation of baryons causes contraction of dark matter and steepens the dark matter profile in the central region from @xmath4 in the adiabatic runs to @xmath5 in the simulations with cooling . * gas cooling induces inflow of high - entropy gas from the outside and raises the level of entropy and gas temperature in the cluster core region . * stellar feedback and/or additional preheating",
    "suppress the effects described above by regulating gas cooling .",
    "the magnitude of the effects on the distribution of dark matter , entropy and temperature of gas is , therefore , sensitive to the total fraction of baryons which cooled to form stars and cold gas clouds .",
    "the cluster simulations with cooling and starformation revealed a significant problem : 35 - 55% of baryons within the virial radius are in the form of cold gas and stars at @xmath3 , which is significantly larger than the observed value of @xmath610 - 20% ( _ e.g. , _",
    "balogh 2001 ; lin , mohr & stanford 2003 ) .",
    "this problem was previously reported in the simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations ( _ e.g. , _ suginohara & ostriker 1998 ; lewis et.al . 2000 ; tornatore et.al .",
    "we find that the same problem exists in our higher - resolution eulerian simulations that include metallicity - dependent radiative cooling .",
    "moreover , we find that the cold and stellar mass fractions depend on the details of star formation implementation",
    ". however , we were not able to solve the overcooling problem by varying parameters of thermal stellar feedback within reasonable limits , as shown in figure  [ fcold ] .",
    "additional preheating can help resolve some of the discrepancies between cluster simulations and observations .",
    "such preheating , presumably associated with the epoch of vigorous starformation , is often advocated as the solution to the overcooling problem and the discrepancies between the predicted and observed cluster scaling relations ( _ e.g. , _ bialek et.al . 2001",
    "; muanwong et.al .",
    "2002 , da silva et.al .",
    "our results , however , indicate that the additional preheating results in starformation history significantly different from observations , as shown in figure  2 .",
    "if the preheating occurs relatively early ( @xmath7 ) the gas manages to cool back by z@xmath81 , and the resulting star formation rate remains high ( @xmath9 ) at @xmath10 .",
    "this results in incorrect star formation history : most of the cluster stars form in the last 7 - 10 billion years in stark contrast to observations , which indicate that less than 30% of cluster stars form during this epoch .",
    "if preheating occurs late , the amount of the required energy is unrealistic and the expected effect on the intergalactic medium is in contradiction to observations of the low - redshift lyman alpha forest .",
    "these results provide a strong argument against the simple uniform `` preheating '' scenario .",
    "= 2.5truein = 2.5truein",
    "the overcooling problem is a serious challenge for the cluster formation simulations .",
    "our analysis shows that the overcooling in a cluster as a whole is really the overcooling in its core . in other words ,",
    "the central cluster galaxies formed in simulations are too massive and bright compared to observations .",
    "analysis of cluster evolution indicates that the problem sets in early at high redshifts , and is not limited to a single object or region .",
    "this indicates that an additional heating mechanism is necessary for reproducing the observed cluster properties .",
    "these results lend support to the idea that feedback from active galactic nuclei is an important missing ingredient in the current simulations of cluster formation ."
