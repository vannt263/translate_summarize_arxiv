    "possible future measurements of the exclusive production of heavy vector mesons and @xmath2 bosons in @xmath6 collisions at the tevatron and @xmath7 collisions at the lhc should extend and complement the existing measurements from hera in terms of both the energy span and the precision .",
    "in particular , by the measurement of exclusive @xmath1 or @xmath0 production at the lhc through the detection of two rapidity gaps with the lepton pair from the meson decay identified in the central atlas or cms detectors , one could probe the gluon density down to @xmath8 for @xmath1 or @xmath9 for @xmath0 .",

    "the estimates of this paper are based on the equivalent - photon approximation combined with a dipole model used to compute the diffractive scattering of a quasireal photon on the proton . in the presence of a hard scale , such as the heavy quark ( or @xmath2 ) mass , the impact parameter dependent dipole saturation ( `` b - sat '' ) model @xcite incorporates the impact factor for the photon to heavy meson ( or @xmath2 ) transition in accordance with leading - order ( lo ) @xmath10-factorisation , together with lo dglap evolution of the gluon density .",
