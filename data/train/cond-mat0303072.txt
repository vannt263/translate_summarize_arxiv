    "electrochemical phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and technology . they play a fundamental role in many materials science problems of high practical relevance , such as corrosion , electrodeposition of parts and circuitry , and battery technology @xcite .",
    "electron transfer is also crucially involved in many biochemical reactions @xcite . for physicists ,",
    "electrodeposition is interesting because it can lead to the spontaneous formation of highly complex self - organized patterns .",
    "such branched aggregates that are often found on the surfaces of natural minerals have fascinated scientists for centuries because of their plant - like appearance @xcite .    under well - controlled laboratory conditions , a variety of different patterns can be generated , ranging from compact crystals to highly branched dendritic aggregates that can be fractals ( see figure [ figfleury ] ) or densely branched . while dendrites rarely appear in traditional applications of electrodeposition such as metalization and electroplating that take place close to equilibrium , they can be of practical importance far from equilibrium , for example in battery technology @xcite : figure [ figrosso ] shows the growth of dendrites in a lithium battery . since dendrites can perforate insulating layers and lead to shortcuts when they reach the counterelectrode , they must be eliminated as much as possible .",
    "to achieve this goal , a good understanding of the various phenomena occurring in electrochemical cells is necessary .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to develop a microscopic model for electrodeposition that can be used to elucidate some of the aspects of dendrite formation .",
    "solution ( sample size @xmath0 ) .",
    "only a small part of the sample is shown .",
    ", width=302 ]        to fix the ideas , let us consider the simplest possible situation that corresponds to the experimental setup of figs .",
    "[ figfleury ] and  [ figrosso ] : two electrodes made of the same metal are plunged in an electrolyte containing ions of the same metal . when a potential difference is applied by an external generator , as a response an ionic current flows through the electrolyte .",
    "close to the cathode , ions are reduced by electron transfer from the electrode and form a growing deposit .",
    "the inverse takes place at the anode : metal is dissolved , and new ions are formed . for liquid electrolytes ( such as used in fig .",
    "[ figfleury ] ) , the inhomogeneities in the ion concentrations lead to strong convective flows @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for gel - like electrolytes ( such as used in fig .",
    "[ figrosso ] ) , convection is suppressed @xcite , and the important ingredients for the description of the ion transport in the electrolyte are diffusion and migration of the ions . at the metal - electrolyte interface , there exists in general a charged double layer that is much thicker than the microscopic solid - electrolyte interface , but much smaller than a typical cell dimension .",
    "there is a considerable amount of work on electrochemical cells based on a macroscopic viewpoint @xcite in which the microscopic interface is replaced by a mathematically sharp surface .",
    "such models are generally unable to handle the geometrical complexity of a fully developed dendrite .",
    "in addition , this approach has to rely on phenomenological models to incorporate reaction kinetics at the interfaces .    in the statistical physics community , considerable interest in electrodeposition",
    "was spurned by the fact that the geometrical structure of fractal electrodeposits @xcite is strikingly similar to patterns generated by the diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) model @xcite , in which random walkers irreversibly stick to the growing aggregate .",
    "subsequently , many refinements of the dla model were developed to generate various patterns , for example by the inclusion of surface tension @xcite , anisotropic growth rules and noise reduction @xcite , introduction of a uniform drift to mimic an electric field @xcite , and combinations of discrete aggregation and continuous convection models to study the influence of fluid convection @xcite .",
    "however , these models greatly simplify the underlying physics ( for example , the charged double layers are not included ) and can hence not yield detailed information on the relation between growth conditions and characteristics of the growth structures such as growth speed , branch thickness , and overall structure .",
    "the same is true for a recent mean - field model that does not explicitly contain the charged ions @xcite .",
    "our goal is to build a simplified microscopic model for electrodeposition that includes enough of the salient physics to make contact with the macroscopic view of electrochemistry .",
    "the electrochemical mean - field kinetic equations ( emfke ) developed here are based on a lattice - gas model with simple microscopic evolution rules that contains charged particles , coupled to a discretized version of the poisson equation .",
    "lattice gas models have been used previously in the context of electrochemistry to simulate phenomena located on the electrode surfaces , such as adsorption or underpotential deposition @xcite , and for studies of ionic transport at liquid - liquid interfaces @xcite ; however , there exists , to our knowledge , no theoretical study of the behavior of an entire electrochemical cell based on a microscopic model .    to investigate the dynamics of the lattice model",
    ", we extend the formalism of mean - field - kinetic - equations ( mfke ) @xcite that has been used to study numerous transport and growth phenomena in alloys , including diffusion and ordering kinetics @xcite , spinodal decomposition @xcite and dendritic growth @xcite ; some preliminary results on the extension to electrochemistry have been published in refs .",
    "the key feature of this approach is that the microscopic particle currents can be written in the mean - field approximation as the product of a mobility times the gradient of chemical potentials , the latter being the appropriate thermodynamic driving forces .",
    "the formalism can be generalized in a natural way to charged particles .",
    "the driving forces for particle currents are then the gradients of the electrochemical potential . as a consequence",
    ", the resulting model displays the correct electrochemical equilibrium at the interfaces .",
    "while it obviously still contains strong simplifications , it is much closer to the basic microscopic physics and chemistry than the dla - type models and allows us to establish a direct link between a microscopic model and the well - established macroscopic phenomenological equations .",
    "quite remarkably , the equations of motion of our model also share many common features with a phase - field formulation of the electrochemical interface that was developed very recently @xcite .",
    "this indicates that mean - field equations of simplified models can also be useful to understand the connection between phase - field models and a more microscopic viewpoint .    in this paper",
    ", we will first present the lattice gas model and derive the electrochemical mean - field kinetic equations ( section 2 ) . in section 3 ,",
    "we carry out one - dimensional simulations to demonstrate that the model leads to the correct equilibrium at the electrode - electrolyte interface .",
    "we also calculate one - dimensional steady state solutions for moving interfaces that are in good agreement with the macroscopic continuous model of chazalviel @xcite .",
    "finally , we show some preliminary simulations of dendritic growth in two - dimensional cells .",
    "section 4 contains a brief discussion and conclusion .",
    "we consider an electrochemical cell made of a dilute binary electrolyte and two metallic electrodes of the same metal .",
    "no supporting electrolyte is included in the present study .",
    "these conditions correspond to the experimental situation in figs .",

    "it is convenient to represent the electrolyte by the same lattice , occupied by a solvent , cations , anions , or vacancies .",
    "although there is no physical lattice in the liquid , its presence here does not play a role due to the high dilution of the ions .    for simplicity ,",
    "we consider here a two - dimensional lattice gas on a square lattice with lattice spacing @xmath1 ( see figure [ figcell ] ) .",
    "the cations @xmath2 give metallic atoms @xmath3 after reduction , while the anions @xmath4 are supposed to be non electroactive . the solvent @xmath5 is neutral , but can interact through short - range interactions with the other species and with itself . we specify a microscopic configuration by the set @xmath6 of the occupation numbers @xmath7 on each site @xmath8 : @xmath9 if @xmath8 is occupied by species @xmath10 or a vacancy @xmath11 , and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "we suppose steric exclusion between the different species , that is , a given site can be occupied by only one species or it can be empty ( vacancy ) : @xmath13 finally , as will become clear below , it is convenient to introduce electrons in the metallic electrodes .",
    "they have a particular status that will be discussed later .",
    "two very different types of interactions have to be considered .",
    "the short - range interactions ( including , for example , van der waals forces , solvatation effects , and chemical interactions ) are modeled here by nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath14 between species @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( with the convention that a positive @xmath17 corresponds to an attractive interaction ) .",
    "interaction energies with vacancies are taken to be zero . to take into account the long - range electrostatic interaction ,",
    "it would be possible to introduce appropriate interaction energies with farther neighbors ; however , this procedure becomes cumbersome with increasing interaction range .",
    "instead , we consider a `` coarse - grained '' electrical potential @xmath18 defined on the lattice sites @xmath8 ( that is , a potential that has been smoothed over distances smaller than @xmath1 ) and that obeys poisson s equation with the simplest nearest - neighbor discretization for the laplace operator , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dielectric constant ( for simplicity , we take a constant that is the same for all species ) , @xmath21 is the electric charge of species @xmath15 , and @xmath22 the spatial dimension .",

    "this leads to more complicated kinetic equations and has not been considered here . to specify the jump rates",
    ", we assume that the atoms perform activated jumps .",
    "the height of the activation barrier depends on the local binding energy , that is , the number and type of bonds that need to be broken ( see fig .",

    "the derivation of the electrochemical mean - field kinetic equations follows the same procedure as for neutral particles @xcite .",

    "( [ diffmig ] ) is exactly the classical continuous description of ion diffusion and migration .",
    "so far , the mean - field equations are quite similar to the ones governing the evolution of multi - component alloys . however , two important new elements have now to be taken into account : ( i ) how to calculate the electric potential in the mean - field model , and ( ii ) the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes .",
    "the electric potential has to be obtained , as before , by resolving poisson s equation .",
    "however , some additional considerations are necessary , because it turns out that the treatment of the boundary conditions at the electrode surfaces becomes non - trivial in the mean - field context . to understand this , it is useful to start with some comments on the consequences of the mean - field approximation .",
    "the parameters of the model that control the phase diagram are the various interaction energies and the temperature .",
    "obviously , we want to create and maintain two distinct phases , namely the metallic electrodes and the electrolyte . hence",
    ", the interaction energies need to be chosen such that phase separation occurs . as usual for this kind of lattice models , there exists a critical temperature for phase separation .",
    "close below the critical point , the equilibrium concentrations of the two phases are close to each other , that is , there are many metal particles in the electrolyte phase , and vice versa .",
    "the concentration of these minority species decreases with temperature . in the original lattice gas model ,",
    "it is then possible for low enough temperatures to identify the geometry of the bulk phases with the connected clusters of metal and electrolyte species .    in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the concentration variables ( occupation probabilities ) are continuous , and each species has a non - vanishing concentration at each site .",
    "this means that the electrode always contains small quantities of solvent and ions , and the electrolyte contains a small quantity of metal .",
    "of course , these concentrations can be made arbitrarily small by lowering the temperature .",
    "however , we then face another difficulty .",
    "the interface between the two bulk phases , which was the sharp boundary between connected clusters in the discrete model , is now diffuse with a characteristic thickness that depends on the temperature . for low temperatures ,",
    "this thickness becomes smaller than the lattice spacing , which leads to strong lattice effects on static and dynamic properties of the interface @xcite : the surface tension and mobility of the interface depend on its position and orientation with respect to the lattice , and for very low temperatures the interface can be entirely pinned in certain directions . as a consequence , we have to make a compromise in choosing the temperature : it must be low enough to obtain reasonably low concentrations of the minority species , but high enough to avoid lattice pinning and to obtain a reasonably diffuse interface ( that extends over a few lattice sites ) .",
    "this has consequences for the resolution of poisson s equation .",
    "the boundary conditions of constant electric potential in the electrodes are easy to impose in a model with sharp boundaries . for diffuse interfaces",
    ", we have to decide where the electrodes end . another way to state",
    "the problem is to remark that the existence of an electric field in the electrolyte creates surface charges in the conductor that are localized at the surface . in a system with diffuse interfaces ,",
    "this surface charge is `` smeared out '' over the thickness of the interface , and we need a method to determine this charge distribution .",
    "we solve these problems by the introduction of electrons that are free to move within the metallic electrodes and solve the poisson equation for all the charges , including electrons .",
    "more precisely , we denote by @xmath70 the deviation from the neutral state expressed in electrons per site .",
    "hence , @xmath71 corresponds to an excess of electrons , @xmath72 to an electron deficit .",
    "their chemical potential is defined by @xmath73 @xmath74 being the density of electronic states at the fermi level @xmath75 of the metal , and @xmath76 .",
    "this corresponds to the screening approximation of thomas - fermi @xcite . the electronic current is then written as an electronic mobility times the discrete gradient of the chemical potential , @xmath77 and the time evolution of the excess electron concentration is @xmath78 note that the choice of this dynamics is somewhat arbitrary ; it could be replaced by any other process that leads to an equilibrium of the electron distribution with the ionic charge distribution on a time scale that is much faster than the characteristic time of evolution of the other species .",
    "one important feature is that the electrons must remain in the electrodes ; otherwise , a `` leakage '' current may occur .",
    "we have tested two different possibilities to achieve this goal .",
    "we can either consider that the electrons are in a potential well in the metallic regions such that they remain confined in the metal , or we can suppose that their mobility vanishes outside the metallic regions . here , we have chosen the second possibility and written the mobility in the form , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a constant frequency prefactor , and @xmath81 is an interpolation function that is equal to @xmath82 for large metal concentrations and falls to zero for low metal concentrations . with this choice ,",
    "the electronic jump probability is important only if nearest neighbor sites @xmath8 and @xmath83 have a large enough probability to be occupied by metallic atoms .",
    "we have used for @xmath81 @xmath84+\\tanh [ p_{c}/\\xi ] } { \\tanh [ ( 1-p_{c})/\\xi ] + \\tanh [ p_{c}/\\xi ] } ,   \\label{eq13c}\\ ] ] a monotonous function that varies from @xmath12 when @xmath85 to @xmath82 for @xmath86 , with a rapid increase through an interval in @xmath87 of order @xmath88 centered around some concentration @xmath89 that is reminiscent of a percolation threshold .",
    "this interpolation is motivated by the fact that the metallic region must be dense enough to be connected and thus allow the electrons to propagate .",
    "to determine the electrostatic potential , we solve the mean - field version of poisson s equation , including the new contribution from the electrons , @xmath90 this equation is now solved in the whole system , including the electrodes .",
    "note that we still use a constant permittivity @xmath20 ; however , the phase - dependent mobility of the electrons makes the resistivity in the electrolyte much higher than in the metal .",
    "this method provides a fast way to calculate the surface charges on the electrodes .",
    "as will be shown below , it works perfectly well at equilibrium .",
    "however , in out - of - equilibrium simulations , a problem appears on the side of the anode where the metal is dissolved .",
    "since the mobility rapidly decreases with the metal concentration , electrons present on the metallic site before dissolution may be trapped in the electrolyte , leading to spurious electronic charges in the bulk .",
    "we have solved this problem in a phenomenological way by adding a term to the evolution equation for the electrons that relaxes the electronic charge to zero in the electrolyte , @xmath91p_{\\mathbf{k}}^{e } , \\label{eqdpedt}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the same interpolation function as @xmath81 , but with different parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 . with a convenient choice of these parameters ,",
    "`` electron relaxation '' occurs only in the liquid .      on the electrode surfaces ,",
    "electron transfer takes places .",
    "more precisely , metallic cations @xmath95 located in the electrolyte may receive an electron from a neighboring metallic site and be reduced ; in turn , metal atoms in contact with the electrolyte may reject an electron to a neighboring metallic site and become an ion , @xmath96 the direction of the transfer depends on the relative magnitude of the electrochemical potentials of the involved species .",
    "reduction of cations on a site @xmath8 of the cathode appears when @xmath97 otherwise , the metal is oxidized .",
    "consequently , we define @xmath98 as the current of electronic charges from @xmath27 to @xmath99 ( current of positive charges from @xmath8 to @xmath27 ) reducing the cations on site @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "electronic current issued from the oxidation of the metal ) via a corresponding elimination ( resp .",
    "creation ) of electrons on site @xmath27 . following @xcite , we can write the reaction rate , @xmath100 this corresponds to an activated electronic charge transfer between the metal surface and the nearest neighboring cation .",
    "the total reduction rate on site @xmath8 is the sum of all the reaction paths @xmath101 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath102 can be determined by comparison with the mesoscopic theory of butler - volmer ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the currents @xmath103 have non negligible values only on the interfaces .",
    "however , as discussed before , there are small concentrations of ions in the metal and metal atoms in the electrolyte ; this would lead to undesirable contributions of the reaction term inside the bulk phases .",
    "therefore , we use the same interpolation function @xmath104 as for the electron mobility and write @xmath105 where @xmath106 is again a constant frequency factor . in this way",
    ", the transfer is localized around the metal - electrolyte interface , where occupied metallic sites and electrolyte sites are neighbors . to completely suppress the electrochemical processes in the bulk phases , we set the transfer current to zero when the product of the two interpolation prefactors is smaller than @xmath107 .",
    "after all the different pieces are combined , the complete set of equations is @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath91p_{\\mathbf{k}% } ^{e}-\\sum_{\\mathbf{a}}\\sigma _ { \\mathbf{k+a , k } } ,   \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] @xmath112 the local concentration of the species @xmath3 and @xmath2 is modified by transport ( diffusion and migration in the electric field ) and by the chemical reaction ; for the other species @xmath4 and @xmath5 , only transport is present .",
    "the reaction term is active only in the solid - electrolyte interface and has of course an opposite sign in eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) , and no contributions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq7a ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq4 ] ) through ( [ eq8 ] ) are integrated in time by a simple euler scheme ( with constant or variable timestep ) .",
    "two methods are used to solve poisson s equation .",
    "equation ( [ eq9 ] ) can either be solved for each timestep using a conjugate gradient method , or it can be converted into a diffusion equation with a source term and solved by simple relaxation ; the second method generally is computationally faster and converges well for interfaces that move slowly enough .",
    "the complete emfke model involves a considerable number of parameters . in particular , we need to make a choice for all the short - range interaction energies .",
    "they determine the phase diagram of the four - component system that consists of metal , solvent , anions , and cations . to obtain meaningful results ,",
    "the model has to be used not too far from a two - phase equilibrium between a metal - rich electrode and a liquid phase rich in solvent and ions .",
    "for an arbitrary choice of interaction energies , obtaining the equilibrium concentrations for all of the species in the two phases is not a trivial task .",
    "the conditions for a two - phase equilibrium are ( i ) equal electrochemical potentials for each independent species ( four in our case ) , and ( ii ) equal grand potential .",
    "this yields five conditions for eight unknowns ( four equilibrium concentrations in each phase ) ; consequently , three degrees of freedom remain that may be fixed , for example the concentrations of ions and metal in the liquid .",
    "this constitutes a set of five coupled nonlinear equations for the remaining unknowns .    to simplify the task of finding an equilibrium configuration , we start from a simpler system , namely a mixture of metal , solvent , and vacancies , that is equivalent to a binary alloy with vacancies ( abv ) . for a symmetric interaction matrix , @xmath113",

    "the small homogeneous ion concentrations inside the electrodes are now different for positive and negative ions .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the global equilibrium : since the electrochemical potentials are constant throughout the whole system and the ion concentrations in the liquid are fixed , the ion concentrations in the solid are multiplied by factors @xmath154 with respect to the reference state @xmath155 . the resulting `` background charge '' in the bulk electrode",
    "is exactly compensated by the electrons that have flown in from the metal side of the system .",
    "since the resulting total charge inside the bulk electrode is zero , the potential is constant , which was the original purpose of introducing the electrons .",

    "for an electrolyte that has singly charged ions , @xmath170 , the potential and the deviations of the concentrations from the bulk liquid values all decay exponentially with the distance from the interface .",

    "the results are in good agreement with the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ debye ] ) .",
    "the potential follows an exponential law over several orders of magnitude . however , when the potential approaches its reference value in the liquid , deviations from the exponential behavior occur",
    "this is due to the fact that the buildup of the ion boundary layer at the interface also modifies the chemical potentials for solvent and metal by small amounts .",
    "since the electrochemical potential of the ions depends on the solvent and vacancy concentrations , a complete equilibrium solution must contain these effects .",
    "close to the interface , they are negligible in comparison to the contribution of the electric potential ; only far from the interface , when @xmath175 becomes of the same order as the small shifts in the chemical potentials , the deviations from an exponential become appreciable .",
    "since this occurs for fractions of the potential drop that are less than @xmath176 of @xmath177 , these effects can safely be neglected in the further analysis .",
    "the resulting total charge distribution has the expected double - layer structure , with a much sharper decay in the electrode than in the liquid .",
    "we have checked that the integral of the total charge through the interface is zero to numerical precision .",
    "the electrochemical equilibrium between electrodes and electrolyte depends on the choice of the fermi energy @xmath178 .",
    "indeed , consider a chemical equilibrium in the absence of an electric potential such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ figprof ] . in this state ,",
    "the electrochemical potential of the ions is constant across the cell .",
    "if we fix @xmath178 to be exactly equal to the difference of the chemical potentials of metal and cations , @xmath179 the reaction currents @xmath180 are strictly zero everywhere as long as the potential remains constant .",
    "therefore , the original profile remains an equilibrium state for arbitrary transfer frequency @xmath181 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath178 is set to a value different from @xmath182 , the electron transfer starts and drives the system to a new equilibrium that exhibits a potential difference .",
    "the final potential difference will be close to @xmath183 .",
    "this can be deduced as follows .",
    "for fixed concentrations and electric potential in the liquid , the electrochemical potentials of the ions and the metal are fixed .",
    "therefore , the only way to achieve equilibrium is to adjust the electric potential in the electrode such that the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) balance .",

    "the excess electronic charge @xmath184 is always small , @xmath185 , even at the surface , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figcharges ] . since",
    ", in addition , we have chosen @xmath186 , @xmath187 is only weakly dependent on the local electron density . neglecting the last term in eq .",
    "[ eq12a ] , the electron transfer rate becomes zero when @xmath188 .",
    "we have checked this prediction by performing simulations in isolated cells : the concentrations of all species and the potential were kept fixed at the liquid side , and the system was closed at the solid side for particles and electrons , thus enforcing zero electrical current .",

    "the system remained at constant potential , whereas for @xmath191 , the predicted potential difference developed up to an error of less than @xmath192 .",
    "since all of the charges can be removed from the system by applying an _ external _ potential difference that is just the negative of @xmath193 , the choice of @xmath178 determines the potential of zero charge ( pzc ) of the electrochemical interface .    .",
    "the solid line corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ nernst]).,width=245 ]    of course , the value of @xmath182 as defined above depends on the ion concentration in the liquid .",

    "to drive the interfaces , we apply a fixed potential difference @xmath177 across the cell . for @xmath198 ranging from 1 to 10 and a cell of size 100 with two electrodes of thickness 10 , the system reaches a steady state within @xmath199 timesteps ( @xmath200 ) . within @xmath201 timesteps , the interface advances between 3 and 15 sites , depending on the voltage .",
    "we measure the ionic current in the center of the cell by time - averaging over the second half of the runs .    given the rapid variations of ion concentrations and electronic charges through the interface ( see for example fig .  [ figcharges ] ) , one could expect strong lattice pinning effects @xcite .",
    "we have checked that quantities such as the electronic surface charge , the total transfer rate ( that is , the transfer currents @xmath202 summed up through the interface ) and the ion current indeed do vary as the interface advances through the lattice .",
    "however , for the parameters chosen here , the amplitudes of these lattice oscillations never exceeded a few percent .",
    "the choice of the various time constants does not influence the final results for equilibrium states . in contrast , for growth simulations , they have to be fixed in order to achieve the desired physical conditions .",
    "in particular , this is true for the various jump rates and the electron transfer frequency .",
    "the electric current in the electrolyte is carried by the mobile ions . as mentioned above , the buildup of the ionic boundary layers shifts the chemical potential of metal , solvent , and vacancies as well . since , in our model , the concentration of metal in the electrolyte is comparable to the ion concentrations , this leads to neutral diffusion currents that are unphysical .",

    "[ figjvsv ] .",
    "it is strongly nonlinear .",
    "indeed , two very different regimes are covered by these simulations .",
    "this can be appreciated when looking at the ion and potential profiles in figs .",
    "[ figv1 ] and [ figv10 ] . for @xmath210 ( fig .",
    "[ figv1 ] ) , the ion concentrations remain of the same order of magnitude as the initial concentration ( @xmath211 ) , and except for the two double layers close to the interfaces , the liquid is neutral .",
    "an important part of the potential drop occurs in these double layers ; in the bulk electrolyte , the potential profile is smooth and almost linear .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath212 ( fig .  [ figv10 ] ) , the neighborhood of the cathode has been completely depleted of the anions ( @xmath213 at the cathode ) , and a charged zone extends well beyond the thickness of the equilibrium double layers .",
    "most of the potential drop occurs close to the cathode . since the conductivity in the space - charge zone",
    "is lowered due to the low ion concentration , a considerable increase in the overall voltage @xmath177 leads only to a moderate increase of the current , as seen in fig .  [ figjvsv ] .",
    "all of these findings are in good agreement with the macroscopic one - dimensional calculations of chazalviel @xcite . according to this work ,",
    "the extended space charge is crucial for the emergence of ramified growth : the strong electric field close to the surface leads to an instability of the flat front , and one - dimensional calculations become invalid .",
    "we present now an example for a preliminary simulation of a two - dimensional sample .",
    "the purpose is to show that our model can indeed lead to the emergence of dendritic structures ; however , the conditions that we can simulate are far from typical experimental situations .",
    "the main reason is that in experiments , the branches of ramified aggregates have typically a thickness in the micron range , whereas the lattice of our model represents a crystal lattice with spacing of the order ngstrms .",
    "it is clear that huge simulation cells would be necessary to observe instabilities and ramified growth on realistic scales . to obtain a computationally tractable problem",
    ", we have to work with unrealistically high driving forces , since this is known to reduce the characteristic scales of branched growth structures .",
    "therefore , we use a much higher driving potential than in the previous simulations , namely 100 @xmath206 .",
    "this corresponds to about 2.5 v at room temperature , which is a fairly typical value ; however , this potential difference is applied through a cell that is , as before , 100 lattice sites long , which corresponds to a length of a few nanometers .",
    "therefore , the electric fields are much higher in our simulation than in reality .    under these conditions ,",
    "the behavior of the moving interface is quite sensitive to the model parameters , and in particular to the frequency factors for the electron transfer , @xmath181 , and the metal jump frequency @xmath214 ( as before , we take @xmath203 as a reference value ) . to assure that the growth is still transport - limited for the higher driving force",
    ", @xmath181 has to be chosen large enough ; for reaction - limited growth , no morphological instability occurs .",
    "the metal jump frequency has to be chosen carefully . on the one hand , if it is too high , bumps on the surface are smoothed out too rapidly by surface diffusion and/or an evaporation - condensation mechanism . on the other hand , if it is too low , the diffusion of metal on the solid side of the interface becomes so slow that the interface profile can not be maintained , and the metal grows at a concentration far below its equilibrium value @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2d ] , we show an example computed with @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 .",
    "the cell has a size 40 @xmath218 100 lattice sites , with periodic boundary conditions parallel to the interfaces .",
    "the simulation was started from a flat interface , with random shifts of the metal concentration in the interfaces to trigger the instability .",
    "when one layer of the anode was dissolved , the whole cell was shifted backward by one site in order to keep the electrolyte in the center of the cell . it can be seen that a bump grows on the interface and develops into a finger - like structure .",
    "other bumps that initially develop on the interface are screened .",
    "the whole region that surrounds the dendrite is depleted of ions .",
    "an extended charged region forms ahead of the tip .",
    "when the tip gets closer to the anode , the electric field increases and leads to growth of the metal at unphysically low concentrations .",

    "the white `` contour '' at the electrode surfaces is the charged double layer ; the gray region in front of the dendrite has been almost completely depleted of ions.,width=302 ]",
    "in summary , we have shown here that , starting from a simple microscopic model , it is possible to build electrochemical - mean - field - kinetic equations ( emfke ) that are able to reproduce qualitatively the behavior of electrochemical cells .",
    "both the charged double layers present at equilibrium and the extended space charge that develops during growth are correctly reproduced .",
    "dendritic structures can be simulated , albeit for unrealistic parameters .",
    "hence , the emfke contain the fundamental ingredients that are necessary to simulate dendritic growth by electrodeposition .",
    "our model shares many common features with a recent phase - field formulation of electrodeposition @xcite .",
    "the phase - field method , originally developed in the context of solidification in the 1980s @xcite , is a continuous model of phase transitions that uses an auxiliary indicator field , the phase field , to distinguish between the different thermodynamic phases ( here , electrodes and electrolyte ) .",
    "a phenomenological equation of motion for the phase field is usually derived from a free energy functional . in our emfke approach ,",
    "the role of the phase field is played by the metal concentration .",
    "since the phase - field method is phenomenological , it has a certain freedom of choice for the dynamics of the phase field itself , and can hence avoid the problems that arise in our model due to the presence of metal in the electrolyte .",
    "however , no direct link to a microscopic model is established , which is the strength of our approach .",
    "our equations still contain some phenomenological elements , in particular , the interpolation function for electron diffusivity and reaction rates .",
