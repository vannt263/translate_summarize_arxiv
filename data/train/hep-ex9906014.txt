    "the interaction of quasi - real photons ( @xmath2 ) studied at lep and the interaction of a quasi - real photon with a proton studied at hera ( photoproduction ) are very similar processes . in leading order ( lo )",
    "different event classes can be defined in @xmath0 and @xmath1p interactions .",
    "the photons can either interact as ` bare ' photons ( `` direct '' )    or as hadronic fluctuations ( `` resolved '' ) .",
    "direct and resolved interactions can be separated by measuring the fraction @xmath3 of the photon s momentum participating in the hard interaction for the two photons . in @xmath0 interactions",
    "they are labelled @xmath4 for the two photons .",
    "ideally , the direct @xmath0 events with two bare photons are expected to have @xmath5 and @xmath6 , whereas for double - resolved events both values @xmath7 and @xmath8 are expected to be much smaller than one . in photoproduction , the interaction of a bare photon with the proton is labelled ` direct ' ( corresponding to ` single - resolved ' in @xmath0 ) and the interaction of a hadronic photon is called ` resolved ' ( corresponding to ` double - resolved ' in @xmath0 ) .",
    "studying jets gives access to the parton dynamics of @xmath0 interactions .",
    "opal has therefore measured di - jet production in @xmath0 scattering at @xmath9  gev using the cone jet finding algorithm with @xmath10  @xcite .    the differential cross - section @xmath11 for di - jet events with pseudorapidities @xmath12 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ettwojet ] .",
    "the measurements are compared to a parton level nlo calculation  @xcite for three different nlo parametrisations of the parton distributions of the photon grv - ho  @xcite , afg  @xcite and gs  @xcite .",
    "the calculations using the three different nlo parametrisations are in good agreement with the data points except in the first bin where theoretical and experimental uncertainties are large .",
    "[ fig - psi ]",
    "the jet shape is characterised by the fraction of a jet s transverse energy ( @xmath13 ) that lies inside an inner cone of radius @xmath14 concentric with the jet defining cone : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the transverse energy within the inner cone of radius @xmath14 and @xmath17 is the total number of jets in the sample .",
    "the jet shapes are corrected to the hadron level using the monte carlo .",
    "it has been shown by opal that the jets become narrower with increasing @xmath13 , that the jet shapes are nearly independent of @xmath18 and that gluon jets are broader than quark jets  @xcite .",
    "the measured jet shapes are compared to data from the hera experiments in similar kinematic ranges .",
    "h1 has measured jet shapes for di - jet events produced in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) with @xmath19  gev@xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the events are boosted into the breit - frame .",
    "zeus has mesured jet shapes in di - jet photoproduction for quasi - real photons in the lab frame  @xcite . in the regions @xmath22 ( h1 data ) and and @xmath23 ( zeus data )",
    ", most jets should be quark jets .",
    "the same is true for the opal data at relatively large @xmath13 , where the direct process dominates . a comparison shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - psi ] performed for similar transverse energy ranges shows good agreement of the opal @xmath0 and the h1 dis data .",
    "the jets in photoproduction events measured by zeus are narrower than the @xmath0 jets",
    ". this could be due to the slightly larger @xmath13 in the zeus data .",
    "a detailed comparison of jet widths measured in @xmath0 interactions and other processes ( @xmath24p ) has recently been published by topaz  @xcite .",
    "hadron production at large transverse momenta is also sensitive to the partonic structure of the interactions without the theoretical and experimental problem related to the various jet algorithms .",
    "interesting comparisons of @xmath0 and @xmath1p data taken at lep and hera , respectively , should be possible in the future , since similar hadronic centre - of - mass energies @xmath25 of the order 100 gev are accessible for both type of experiments .",
    "the distributions of the transverse momentum @xmath26 of hadrons produced in @xmath0 interactions are expected to be harder than in @xmath1p or hadron - p interactions due to the direct component .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - wa69 ] by comparing @xmath27 for charged hadrons measured in @xmath0 interactions by opal  @xcite to the @xmath28 distribution measured in @xmath1p and hp ( h@xmath29k ) interactions by wa69  @xcite .",
    "the wa69 data are normalised to the @xmath0 data in the low @xmath28 region at @xmath30  mev/@xmath31 using the same factor for the hp and the @xmath1p data .",
    "the hadronic invariant mass of the wa69 data is about @xmath32  gev which is of similar size as the average @xmath33 of the @xmath0 data in the range @xmath34  gev .",
    "whereas only a small increase is observed in the @xmath1p data compared to the h@xmath35 data at large @xmath26 , there is a significant increase of the relative rate in the range @xmath36  gev/@xmath31 for @xmath0 interactions due to the direct process .",
    "the @xmath0 data are also compared to a zeus measurement of charged particle production in @xmath1p events with a diffractively dissociated photon at @xmath37  gev  @xcite the invariant mass relevant for this comparison should be the mass @xmath38 of the    dissociated system ( the invariant mass of the ` @xmath1-pomeron ' system ) .",
    "the average @xmath39 equals 10 gev for the data shown .",
    "the @xmath26 distribution falls exponentially , similar to the @xmath1p and hadron - p data , and shows no flatening at high @xmath26 due to a possible hard component of the pomeron .",
    "nlo calculations  @xcite of the cross - sections @xmath27 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dspt ] .",
    "the cross - sections are calculated using the qcd partonic cross - sections , the nlo grv parametrisation of the parton distribution functions  @xcite and fragmentation functions fitted to e@xmath40e@xmath41 data .",
    "the renormalisation and factorisation scales are set equal to @xmath26 .",
    "the change in slope around @xmath42  gev/@xmath31 in the nlo calculation is due to the charm threshold .",
    "the agreement between the data and the nlo calculation is good .",
    "the production of prompt photons in @xmath0 interactions can also be used to measure the quark and gluon content of the photon  @xcite . at tristan energies the single - resolved process @xmath43",
    "is expected to dominate the prompt photon production cross - section , whereas at lep2 energies double - resolved processes should become important .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig - topaz ]    topaz has measured the prompt photon cross - section @xmath44 by fitting signal plus background ( mainly from @xmath45 decays ) to variables describing the shower shape in the calorimeter ( fig .  [ fig - topaz ] ) .",
    "the variables are the rms of the cluster width in the r@xmath46 direction , @xmath47 , and the ratio of the maximum energy in a cluster to the total cluster energy , @xmath48 .",
    "topaz obtains @xmath49  pb for photons with energies greater than 2 gev using a data set with an integrated luminosity of @xmath50  pb .",
    "this result is about 1.5 - 2 standard deviations larger than the lo cross - sections @xmath44 of @xmath51  pb and @xmath52  pb which were obtained with pythia using sas-1d  @xcite and lac1  @xcite , respectively .",
    "i want to thank hisaki hayashii for helping me with the topaz data , michael klasen for providing the nlo calculations of the di - jet cross - sections , tancredi carli for discussion on the jet shapes and the organizers for this interesting and enjoyable workshop .",
