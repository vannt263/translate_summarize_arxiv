    "over the past ten years , a considerable effort has been made to study gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the solution of the puzzle about their distance by the bepposax satellite in 1997 with the detection of the first afterglow @xcite was followed by a small fleet of satellites ( swift , hete , agile , and now the fermi gamma ray space telescope ) that performed an extensive study in the kev - mev energy range . at ground level",
    ", air shower detectors can contribute to the study of the energy region @xmath6 1 gev using the `` single particle technique '' @xcite , i.e. counting all the particles hitting the detector without measurement of the energy and arrival direction of the primary gamma rays .",
    "+ the processes leading to the detection of very high energy ( vhe ) radiation ( extending between 1 gev and 1 tev ) from a grb start with the acceleration of the parent particles .",
    "since the models predicting the production of gamma rays in this energy range are both leptonic and hadronic , the maximum energy of electrons and protons is linked to the fireball parameters @xcite .",
    "once the parent particles have been accelerated , the vhe gamma rays can result from several production processes - mainly inverse compton scattering by electrons , electron and proton synchrotron emission , and photon - pion production - each of them included in a wide variety of theoretical models with different hypotheses on the production region , giving different features of the emitted signal ( see for example the review article by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "once produced , the vhe radiation suffers absorption either in the source itself or in the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) before reaching the earth @xcite .",
    "the detected signal is thus the overlap of the previous mechanisms , that are difficult to disentangle ; nevertheless the measurements in this energy range can be used as a test for the competing models . in particular , the detection of vhe gamma rays and the measurement of the cutoff energy in the grb spectrum could provide valuable clues to the baryon content , lorentz factor , and ambient magnetic field of the relativistic fireball .",
    "no cutoff energy has been detected so far by satellites up to 1 gev , forcing the search into more energetic regions .",
    "the energy range between 1 and 100 gev is particularly interesting since the absorption of high energy gamma rays by the ebl becomes relevant above this region , limiting the possibility of detection to nearby objects while most of the observed grbs occurs at large redshifts . anyway",
    "the knowledge of the ebl is still poor and the problem of the opacity of the universe to gamma rays in the sub - tev energy range still open ( e.g. @xcite ) . + in the 1 - 100 gev energy region , the detection by egret of only 3 grbs @xcite during 7 years of observations indicates that their spectra are usually soft .",
    "recently , the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the fermi gamma ray space telescope announced the detection of more than 10 photons above 1 gev from grb080916c @xcite and of emission up to 3 gev from grb081024b @xcite ( unfortunately both these events were below the horizon of our detector ) . at higher energies , hints",
    "( @xmath0 3@xmath7 ) of emissions detected at ground level have been reported by milagrito for grb970417a ( e @xmath3 650 gev ) @xcite and by the grand array for grb971110 ( e @xmath3 10 gev ) @xcite .",
    "a marginal emission for grb920925c was also reported by hegra airobicc ( e @xmath3 20 tev ) @xcite , while the tibet air shower array found an indication of 10 tev emission in a stacked analysis of 57 bursts @xcite .",
    "+ forty years after their discovery , and more than ten years after the detection of the first afterglow by bepposax , the physical origin of the enigmatic grbs is still under debate .",
    "the scarcity of information generates a confused situation , allowing a great variety of very different models . in these conditions , and mainly in the @xmath3 1 gev energy region , any result could be of great importance to approach the solution of the grb mystery .",
    "+ in this paper , the search for emission in the 1 - 100 gev range in coincidence with the prompt emission detected by satellites is presented for several grbs .",
    "the astrophysical radiation with ground - based observatory at yangbajing ( argo - ybj ) is an extensive air shower detector located at an altitude of 4300 m a.s.l .",
    "( corresponding to a vertical atmospheric depth of 606 g @xmath5 ) at the yangbajing cosmic ray laboratory ( 30.11@xmath8n , 90.53@xmath8e ) .",
    "the detector is composed of a single layer of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) , operated in streamer mode @xcite and grouped into 153 units called `` clusters '' ( 5.7@xmath97.6 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "each cluster is made up of 12 rpcs ( 1.225@xmath92.850 m@xmath1 ) and each rpc is read out by using 10 pads , with dimensions 55.6@xmath961.8 cm@xmath1 , representing the space - time pixels of the detector .",
    "the clusters are disposed in a central full coverage carpet ( 130 clusters , @xmath05600 m@xmath1 , @xmath093% of active surface ) and a sampling guard ring ( @xmath040% of coverage ) in order to increase the effective area and improve the core location reconstruction .",
    "+ the detector is connected to two independent data acquisition systems , corresponding to the shower and scaler operation modes .",
    "+ in shower mode the arrival time and location of each particle are recorded using the `` pads '' .",
    "the present trigger threshold is set to 20 fired pads , corresponding to an energy threshold for photons of a few hundred gev and a trigger rate of @xmath0 3.8 khz .",
    "+ in scaler mode the total counts are measured every 0.5 s : for each cluster the signal coming from its 120 pads , representing the counting rate on a surface of @xmath043 m@xmath1 , is added up and put in coincidence in a narrow time interval ( 150 ns ) , giving the counting rates of @xmath6 1 , @xmath6 2 , @xmath6 3 , and @xmath6 4 pads , that are read by four independent scaler channels .",
    "these counting rates are referred in the following respectively as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , and the corresponding rates are @xmath0 40 khz , @xmath0 2 khz , @xmath0 300 hz , and @xmath0 120 hz . a detailed description of the detector performance can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "+ the installation of the whole detector was completed in spring 2007 , but since the clusters work independently , physical studies started as the installation began , with the active area increasing with time .",
    "although the single particle technique does not provide information about the energy and arrival direction of the primary gamma rays , it allows the energy threshold to be lowered to @xmath0 1 gev , thus overlapping the highest energies investigated by satellite experiments .",
    "moreover , in our application of this technique to the argo - ybj experiment @xcite , with four measurement channels sensitive to different energies , in case of positive detection valuable information on the high energy spectrum slope and possible cutoff may be obtained .",
    "+ since for the grb search in scaler mode the authentication is only given by the satellite detection , the stability of the detector and the probability that it mimics a true signal are crucial and have to be carefully investigated .",
    "details of this study are in @xcite , together with the determination of the effective area , upper limit calculation , and expected sensitivity .",
    "the results obtained show that the main influences on the counting rates are given by the atmospheric pressure ( barometric coefficient for modulation : -(0.9 - 1.2 ) % mbar@xmath15 , connected to the shower development in the atmosphere ) and the detector temperature ( thermal coefficient : 0.2 - 0.4% @xmath8c@xmath15 , linked to the detector efficiency ) . due to the larger time scale variations for these two parameters with respect to the grb prompt phase duration",
    ", the search for grbs can be carried out without any correction for environmental or instrumental effects , since the relevant distributions for single clusters are poissonian .",
    "more significant is the correlation between the clusters due to the probability that some of the counts in different clusters are given by the same events : the effect in this case is to widen background fluctuations , reducing the sensitivity .",
    "+ the grb search can be performed in both shower and scaler modes ; in this paper only the results obtained with the latter are presented and discussed .",
    "data have been collected from 2004 november ( corresponding to the swift satellite launch ) to 2009 april , with a detector active area increasing from @xmath0700 to @xmath06700 m@xmath1 . during this period ,",
    "a total of 81 grbs selected from the gcn circulars archive was inside the argo - ybj field of view ( i.e. with zenith angle @xmath16 , limited only by the atmospheric absorption ) ; for 19 of these the detector and/or data acquisition were not active or not working properly .",
    "the remaining 62 events were investigated by searching for a significant excess in the argo - ybj data coincident with the satellite detection . in order to extract the maximum information from the data ,",
    "two grb analyses have been implemented :    * search for a signal from every single grb ; * search for a signal from the stack of all grbs .    for both analyses ,",
    "the first step is the data cleaning and check . for each event",
    ", the poissonian behaviour of the counting rates for multiplicities @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 for all the clusters is checked using the normalized fluctuation function :    @xmath18    for a period of @xmath1912 h around the grb trigger time . in this formula , representing the significance of an excess compared to background fluctuations , @xmath20 is the number of counts in a time interval of 10 s , @xmath21 the average number of counts in 10 s over a time period of 100 s before and after the signal , and @xmath7 the standard deviation , with about 400 independent samples per distribution .",
    "the interval of 10 s has been chosen to avoid any systematic effect caused by environment and instrument ( such as atmospheric pressure and detector temperature variations ) .",
    "the expected distribution of @xmath22 is the standard normal function ; all the clusters giving a distribution with measured @xmath23 or with anomalous excesses in the tail @xmath24 3 ( i.e. @xmath3 2% ) in at least one multiplicity channel are discarded .",
    "this guarantees that our data fulfill the requirements on stability and reliability of the detector .",
    "the counting rates of the clusters surviving our quality cuts ( @xmath087% ) are then added up and the normalized fluctuation function    @xmath25}{600 } } \\label{ffunction2}\\ ] ]    is used to give the significance of the coincident on - source counts . in this case @xmath26 is the total number of counts in the @xmath27 time interval given by the satellite detector ( corresponding to the collection of 90% of the photons ) and @xmath28 is the number of counts in a fixed time interval of 300 s before and after the signal , normalized to the @xmath27 time .",
    "due to the correlation between the counting rates of different clusters ( given by the air shower lateral distribution ) , the distributions of the sum of the counts are larger than poissonian and this must be taken into account to calculate the significance of a possible signal .",
    "the statistical significance of the on - source counts over the background is obtained again in an interval of @xmath1912 h around the grb trigger time , using equation ( 17 ) of @xcite ; a detailed analysis of the correlation effect and detector stability on counting rates can be found in @xcite .",
    "the analysis can be carried out for the counting rates for all the multiplicities @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and 1 , 2 , 3 , where the counting rates @xmath29 are obtained from the measured counting rates @xmath30 using the relation :    @xmath31    as an example , figure [ fig : fdistrib ] shows the @xmath32 distribution for a single cluster and for the sum of all clusters for grb060121 ; even if all the single clusters show a poissonian behaviour , with width @xmath7 @xmath0 1 , the correlation effect on the sum of the counting rates of all clusters broadens the @xmath33 distribution ( @xmath7 @xmath3 1 ) . in the following ,",
    "all the results are obtained using the counting rate @xmath34 , since it corresponds to the minimum primary energy in the argo - ybj scaler mode .",
    "figure [ fig : sigma ] shows the distribution of the significances for the whole set of 62 grbs .",
    "the gaussian fit to this distribution gives a mean of ( -0.01 @xmath19 0.16)@xmath7 and standard deviation ( 1.22 @xmath19 0.14 ) .",
    "no significant excess is shown ; the maximum significance is obtained for grb080727c ( 3.52 @xmath7 ) , with a chance probability of 1.4% taking into account the total number of grbs analyzed . + the fluence upper limits are then obtained in the 1 - 100 gev energy range adopting a power law spectrum and considering the maximum number of counts at 99% confidence level ( c.l . ) , following equation ( 6 ) of @xcite . for this calculation ,",
    "two different assumptions are used for the power law spectrum : a ) extrapolation from the kev - mev energy region using the spectral index measured by the satellite experiments ; b ) a differential spectral index @xmath35 = -2.5 .",
    "since the mean value of spectral indexes measured by egret in the gev energy region is @xmath35 = -2.0 @xcite , we expect the true upper limits to lie between these two values . for grbs with known redshift , an exponential cutoff in the spectrum",
    "is considered in order to take into account the effects of extragalactic absorption .",
    "the extinction coefficient is calculated using the values given in @xcite . when the redshift is unknown ,",
    "a value @xmath36 = 1 is adopted .",
    "+ since the cutoff energy of grbs is unknown , the following procedure is developed in order to determine an upper limit to this energy at least for some grbs . when using as the grb spectrum the extrapolation of the spectral index measured in the kev - mev region by satellite experiments",
    ", the extrapolated fluence is plotted together with our fluence upper limit as a function of the cutoff energy @xmath37 .",
    "if the two curves cross in the 2 - 100 gev energy range , the intersection gives the upper limit to the cutoff energy .",
    "for these grbs we can state that their spectra do not extend over the obtained @xmath37 upper limit , with a 99% c.l .. figure [ fig : ecut ] shows the cutoff energy upper limits as a function of the spectral index for the 16 grbs for which intersection occurs in the quoted energy range . for two of them ( grb050802 and grb081028a )",
    "the knowledge of the redshift allows the estimation of extragalactic absorption .",
    "+ table [ tab : ul_rs ] lists all the information related to the 9 grbs with known redshift ; table [ tab : ul ] lists the same information for the remaining 53 grbs . in both tables column",
    "( 1 ) is the grb name corresponding to the detection date in ut ( yymmdd ) .",
    "column ( 2 ) gives the satellite(s ) that detected the burst .",
    "column ( 3 ) gives the burst duration @xmath27 as measured by the respective satellite .",
    "column ( 4 ) gives the zenith angle in degrees with respect to the detector location .",
    "column ( 5 ) reports the spectral index : `` band '' and `` cpl '' mean that the spectrum measured by the satellite is better fitted with a double power law @xcite or a cutoff power law , respectively . in this latter case no extrapolation of the spectrum to gev energies has been considered .",
    "column ( 6 ) gives the detector active area for that burst .",
    "our results are reported from column ( 7 ) to ( 10 ) .",
    "column ( 7 ) gives the statistical significance of the on - source counts over the background ; columns ( 8) and ( 9 ) the 99% confidence upper limits on the fluence between 1 and 100 gev for spectral cases a ) and b ) , respectively ; column ( 10 ) the cutoff energy upper limit , if any . the additional column ( 11 ) in table [ tab : ul_rs ] gives the grb redshift .",
    "+ the fluence upper limits obtained in the 1 - 100 gev energy range depend on the zenith angle , time duration and spectral index , reaching values down to @xmath4 erg @xmath5 .",
    "it is worth noticing that these values greatly depend on the energy range of the calculation .",
    "if we consider our sensitivity in terms of the expected number of positive detections , an estimate based on data from the satellite cgro and the swift field of view gives a rate between 0.1 and 0.5 per year @xcite , which is comparable to similar evaluations for other experiments working in different energy regions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ a different analysis is performed supposing a common timing feature in all the grbs .",
    "first , all the events during a time interval @xmath38 t ( with @xmath38t=0.5 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 s ) after t@xmath39 ( the low energy trigger time given by the satellite ) for all the grbs are added up .",
    "this is done in order to search for a possible cumulative high energy emission with a fixed duration after t@xmath39 .",
    "the resulting significances for the 9 time bins ( figure [ fig : stackt ] ) show that there is no evidence of emission for any one of the durations @xmath38 t .",
    "since the bins are not independent , the distribution of the significances of the 9 time bins is compared with random distributions obtained for starting times different from t@xmath39 in a time interval of @xmath1912 h around the true grb trigger time .",
    "the resulting overall significance of the grbs stacked in time with respect to random fluctuations is -0.6 @xmath7 .",
    "a second search is carried out to test the hypothesis that the high energy emission occurs at a specific phase of the low energy burst , independently of the grb duration .",
    "for this study , all 53 grbs with @xmath40 ( i.e. belonging to the `` long grb '' population ) have been added up in phase scaling their duration .",
    "this choice has been made for both physical and technical reasons , adding up the counts for grbs of the same class and long enough to allow a phase plot with 10 bins given our time resolution of 0.5 s. figure [ fig : stackp ] shows the resulting significances for the 10 phase bins ; there is no evidence of emission at a certain phase , and the overall significance of the grbs stacked in phase ( obtained adding up all the bins ) with respect to background fluctuations is -1.4 @xmath7 .",
    "the search for cumulative effects by stacking all the grbs either in fixed time durations or in phases of @xmath27 could enhance a possible signal , making it significant , even if the emission of each grb is below the sensitivity of the argo - ybj detector . in this case",
    ", less information could be given with respect to the single grb coincident detection , but we must consider that with the stacked analysis we increase our sensitivity by increasing the number of grbs , while for the single grb search we decrease our sensitivity because of the increasing number of trials .",
    "the satellite - borne detectors have detected grbs mostly in the sub - mev energy region .",
    "however , several grbs with emission beyond 100 mev have been detected by egret @xcite and , recently , by agile @xcite and by the lat instrument on the fermi gamma ray space telescope @xcite .",
    "these detections indicate that at least a fraction of grbs , in addition to sub - mev photons , may also emit much higher energy photons , possibly extending to the gev - tev region . within the standard fireball shock scenario ,",
    "high energy photons can be produced in both internal @xcite and external @xcite shocks , either by the electron component through the inverse compton process or by the proton component through synchrotron or photo - pion processes . due to the interaction with cosmic infrared background photons ,",
    "most of the high energy grb photons are converted into electron - positron pairs , thus limiting the distance over which they can travel . a correlated detection of grb high energy photons , associated to the redshift measurement based on spectroscopic observations ,",
    "could help determine the extension of the gamma ray horizon and shed light on the problem of the universe `` transparency '' recently raised by the observations of the hess @xcite and magic @xcite telescopes .",
    "proposed explanations of these observations refer to models for the ebl evolution @xcite as well as the particle physics process of photon - alp ( axion - like particle ) oscillation @xcite .",
    "thus , the observation of grb high energy photons is expected to provide important information both on the physical conditions of the emission region and on the interaction processes undergone by the photons while traveling from the source .",
    "+ in this paper we have reported a study concerning the search for gev photons from 62 grbs carried out by the argo - ybj air shower detector operated in scaler mode . in the search for gev gamma rays in coincidence with the low energy grbs detected by satellites , no evidence for vhe emission was found for any event .",
    "the stacked search , both in time and phase , has shown no deviation from the statistical expectations .",
    "+ fluence upper limits as low as @xmath41 erg @xmath5 in the 1  100 gev interval have been set by using argo - ybj data . using the experimental values obtained for the grbs with known redshift and @xmath35 = -2.5 ,",
    "we have calculated the corresponding minimum isotropic gamma ray energy @xmath42 .",
    "considering a cosmology with hubble constant @xmath43 km  s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , matter and dark energy density parameters @xmath44 = 0.3 and @xmath45 = 0.7 , respectively @xcite , we find the minimum value @xmath46 erg for grb071112c , emitted in the energy band 1.8  180 gev due to its redshift @xmath36=0.823 .",
    "this value is quite high , compared to the expected maximum bolometric isotropic energy of about @xmath47 erg , but a beaming effect depending on the energy could greatly change the fraction of the total energy amount required in the quoted energy range . + some relevant constraints can be obtained comparing our fluence upper limits with the expected theoretical spectra . under different assumptions ,",
    "the model of @xcite predicts grb spectra at @xmath36=0.1 with fluences ( in terms of @xmath48 ) roughly between @xmath49 and @xmath50 erg @xmath5 in our energy range of interest .",
    "considering the same cosmological parameters as above and the minimum fluence upper limit of @xmath51 erg @xmath5 ( corresponding to grb060801 ) , the maximum redshift at which such a grb could be detected by argo - ybj ranges between @xmath36 = 0.3 and 1.0 .",
    "+ since we were able to determine upper limits to the cutoff energy in the 2  100 gev energy range for several grbs , we can conclude that a simple extension of the power law spectra measured at low energies is not always possible @xcite .",
    "+ finally , the alert rate provided by the recently launched fermi satellite , with a field of view close to that of swift , doubles our estimate of grb detection @xcite up to a rate between 0.2 and 1 per year , and the capability of the detector shower mode to measure the arrival direction and energy of individual showers above a few hundred gev allows the argo - ybj experiment to study the grbs in the whole 1 gev@xmath521 tev range .",
