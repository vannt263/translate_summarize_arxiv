    "cavity qed , the study of the interaction between atoms and the quantized electromagnetic fields in a micro - cavity , has been one of the central research areas in both quantum optics and quantum information since the pioneering work of purcell  @xcite . in a single cavity with one atom or multi - atoms , the hallmark phenomena , such as vacuum rabi splitting  @xcite , rabi oscillation  @xcite , collective lamb shift  @xcite , and electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite , have been successfully observed .    with the rapid development of experimental technologies in recent years , the system of cca with atoms embedded in has aroused significant attentions .",
    "it is a promising test bed which is widely used in various areas and also a building block for important quantum devices . in quantum simulation , many important phenomena in condensed matter have been successfully observed on this platform , such as mott - superfluid transitions  @xcite and some topological effects  @xcite .",
    "cca also shows its application in controlling single - photon which is of essential importance in quantum optics and quantum information .",
    "one of the pioneering work  @xcite focuses on a 1d cca doped with a two - level system , and shows that the controllable system can behave as a quantum switch for the coherent transport of single photon .",
    "furthermore , the single - photon scattering for 1d cca with a pair of two - level atoms or with three - level atoms has also been discussed  @xcite . aside from the 1d cca , single - photon scattering for 2d cca is also important for its promising application in quantum networks  @xcite .",
    "in addition , cca may be introduced in more research areas , e.g. , a recent paper designed an experiment on cca to explore the basic principle in quantum mechanics  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use cca to investigate the basic problem in cavity qed .",
    "based on 1d cca , we propose a new real space cavity model with a sc as our cavity .",
    "the characteristics of sc empty or with a two - level atom doped in is explored by studying the single - photon scattering problem . applying the discrete coordination scattering equation  @xcite to the case of empty sc ,",
    "we give the transmission spectrum numerically and analytically prove that the transmission peaks shall appear near the eigenvalues of the empty sc system .",
    "these transmission peaks with non - zero width imply that the empty sc can be considered as a well defined multi - mode cavity with dissipation .",
    "in particular , we consider the variation of the single - photon transmission due to a two - level atom which is near resonant with one of the sc modes .",
    "when the atom is located at the antinode of the resonant mode , we observe the vacuum rabi splitting in the transmission spectrum .",
    "however , when the two - level atom is located at the node of the resonant mode , i.e. , it does not interact with the resonant mode , an obvious valley in the transmission spectrum is observed , which is further explained by the destructive interference of two transmission channels , one is provided by the resonant mode of the sc , while the other results from the two - level atom which couples to the non - resonance modes of the sc .",

    "[ sec:4c ] , we introduce the two level approximation of the sc system to physically explain the transmission valley as the destructive interference between the two transmission channels assisted by the two levels respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we briefly discuss the experimental feasibility of the theoretical predictions and give a summary of our results .",

    "[ empty](a ) . in the figure",
    ", we only show the first five peaks , where the fourth peak is zoomed in in fig .",
    "[ empty](b ) .",
    "it is apparent that each peak has a non - zero width which means the corresponding electromagnetic mode in the sc system has finite lifetime due to the dissipation arising from the coupling with the left and right channels . in other words ,",
    "the left and right channels act not only as the carriers of the scattering waves , but also as the dissipation reservoirs of the sc .    as demonstrated above",
    ", the numerical results show that the sc is essentially an @xmath8-mode cavity , and every eigen - mode of the sc has a relatively long life time . in what follows",
    ", we will study how a single two - level atom that couples with the sc can dramatically change the transmission spectrum , and investigate the effects induced by the multi - mode cavity fields .",
    "when a two - level atom interacts with the @xmath0-th cavity , it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian @xmath14 in the eigen - modes of the sc as @xmath63 where @xmath64 note that the coupling strength @xmath65 depends on the location of the atom and the length of the sc .",
    "it is the standard model of cavity qed in the multi - mode setting .",
    "when the frequency of the atom is near resonant with a pre - selection @xmath66th mode of the sc , we may adopt the single mode approximation for the sc .",
    "then the two relative eigen - energy levels are @xmath67 where the vacuum rabi splitting is @xmath68    -th mode of the sc with @xmath69 , and @xmath70.,width=302 ]    now we numerically check the validness of the above single mode approximation .",
    "first , we plot the transmission spectrum when the two - level atom is located at the node and antinode of the resonant mode of the sc , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ resonant ] ( a ) .",
    "when the atom is located at the antinode of the resonant mode , the obvious vacuum rabi splitting appears .",
    "when the atom is located at the node , i.e. , the two - level atom does not interact with the resonant mode of the sc , no vacuum rabi splitting is observed as expected .",
    "however , the peak is lower than @xmath71 in the latter case .",
    "if the single mode approximation is valid , then the two - level atom without interacting with the resonant mode of the sc will not affect the transmission rate .",
    "in other words , it is expected to be similar to the case shown in fig .",
    "[ empty](b ) .",
    "thus we plot the zoom in for the case of the atom at the node as shown in fig .",
    "[ resonant](b ) . obviously , the transmission spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ empty ] ( b ) exhibits an obvious valley exactly at the resonant mode of the sc , which is essentially different from fig .",

    "[ resonant](b ) , the frequency of the atom is tuned to be resonant with the mode while keeping the atom at the node , the transmission spectrum is given for different coupling strength @xmath28 as shown in fig .",
    "[ tunnel](a ) .",
    "when @xmath74 , we recover the transmission spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ empty](b ) . for @xmath28 is not @xmath75 , a second peak appears near the frequency of the atom . since the atom does not couple with the resonant mode",
    ", the peak must be originated from the atom coupling with the non - resonance modes .",
    "we assert that due to the different influence of the outsides , the transmission spectrum for each channel independently is partially overlap at resonant condition which leads to the above mentioned transmission spectrum as shown in next section . by increasing @xmath28 ,",
    "the transmission peak becomes wider as expected .",
    "the numerical result in fig .",
    "[ tunnel](a ) clearly shows that in the case of the atom located at the node of the resonant mode , two channels exist for the photon transmitting through the sc , one is the resonant cavity while the other is result from the atom coupling with the non - resonance modes .",
    "further in fig .",
    "[ tunnel](b ) , we tune the frequency of the atom so that the transmission peaks for the two channels coincides as shown in next section . however , we find that the single photon is completely reflected at the original transmission peak of the resonant mode , which implies the transmission amplitudes through the two channels interfere destructively .",
    "the appearance of the transmission valley comes from the different widths of the transmission peaks from the two channels .",
    "moreover , the widths of the valleys are determined by the coupling strength @xmath28 , and it further confirms the existence of quantum interference . a more physical explanation of the transmission spectrum is given in the next section to intuitively show the mechanism behind the transmission dip .     ( blue solid line ) , @xmath76 ( red dashed line ) , and @xmath77 ( black dotted line).,width=226 ]    as discussed above , the non - resonance modes dramatically change the transmission spectrum when the atom is located at the node , so a natural problem is how the non - resonance modes affect the transmission spectrum when the two - level atom is located at the antinode of the resonant mode .",
    "to this end , we plot the transmission spectrum for different detuning when the atom is located at the antinode as shown in fig .",
    "[ detune ] .",
    "we show that , by tuning the frequency of the atom higher than the resonant mode , the peak of high frequency will move away faster than the one with low frequency , and the opposite behavior can be seen if tuning the atom frequency lower .",
    "obviously , this behavior can not be explained by the single mode approximation , and must be resorted to the effects of non - resonance modes of the sc .",
    "notice that the similar phenomenon is mentioned in ref .",
    "now let us give a more detailed and physical explanation about the transmission valley shown in fig  [ tunnel ] . as we know ,",
    "the energy levels of the sc that are near resonant with the energy of the incoming photon dominates the photon transmission through the sc . in the cases",
    "that the transmission valley occurs , there are two energy levels of the sc that are near resonant with the energy of the incoming photon , one is the near resonant mode of the sc that does not interact with the atom , the other is the atomic excited state dressed by the non - resonance modes .",
    "so it is reasonable to maintain only these two levels in the hamiltonian @xmath14 , which is called the two level approximation . in the two level approximation",
