    "how galaxies formed , evolved , and built - up the local hubble sequence is still an open and highly debated issue .",
    "for instance , there is now evidence for a significant evolution of the stellar mass density at z@xmath31 . even between redshifts as low as z@xmath00.6 and z=0 , the stellar mass density appears to be evolving by 0.2 dex ( i.e. , @xmath040% , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . such an evolution in stellar mass can also be seen in the evolution of the tully - fisher relation , which appears to be evolving by a factor two in stellar mass over the same redshift range @xcite .",
    "such an increase in stellar mass needs to be fed by fresh gas .",
    "the absence of evolution in zero point of the _ baryonic _ tully - fisher relation between z@xmath00.6 and z=0 @xcite suggests that most of this gas was already gravitationally bound to galaxies at z@xmath00.6 .",
    "what is the mechanism driving the conversion of this gas into stars ? in spite of the impressive progress accomplished over the past years , mainly through spatially - resolved kinematics of distant galaxies , this issue still remains without a clear answer .    at z@xmath00.6 ( i.e. , 6 gyr ago )",
    ", @xcite gathered a representative sample of 63 galaxies with @xmath5 and spatially - resolved kinematics derived from flames / giraffe observations at the vlt .",
    "they found that 40% of z@xmath00.6 intermediate - mass galaxies ( i.e. , the progenitors of local spirals ) , have chaotic velocity fields inconsistent with expectations from pure rotating disks .",
    "subsequent analyzes suggest that most of them are likely associated with major mergers @xcite .",
    "mergers are also found to be a good driver for the large scatter seen in the distant tully - fisher relation @xcite . actually , the remarkable co - evolution of the morphology , kinematics , star formation density , metal density , and stellar mass density , all could find a common and natural explanation in the frame of the spiral rebuilding scenario , according to which 50 to 75% of present - day spiral disks were rebuilt after a major merger since z=1 , as proposed by @xcite . to this respect ,",
    "the milky way appears to be exceptional , with a remarkable quite past history compared to other local spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that disk rebuilding indeed took place at z@xmath61 , which makes it as a viable driver for galaxy evolution at these epochs . on the theoretical side",
    ", numerical simulations showed how gas can be expelled in tidal tails during such mergers , and how it can be subsequently re - accreted @xcite .",
    "this re - accreted gas is expected to cool down and form new stars , re - building a new disk around a spheroidal remnant @xcite , which might correspond to morphologies as late as sb galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical developments have shed light on the underlying process , which appears to be purely gravitational @xcite .",
    "the requirement for a major merger to rebuild a new disk depends mainly on the gas fraction during the final coalescence , which needs to be at least 50% @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations are now also producing such re - processed disks at z@xmath31 , although the role of cosmological gas accretion is not totally understood , but taking this process into account could result in a lower gas fraction threshold for rebuilding a new disk @xcite . on the observational side , first examples of rebuilt disks",
    "were recently detected at z@xmath00.6 @xcite , and the auto - consistency of the disk rebuilding process starts being investigated , both theoretically @xcite and observationally @xcite .    if the spiral rebuilding scenario appears to achieve encouraging successes in describing galaxy evolution at z@xmath31 , some points still need to be investigated .",
    "in particular , the impact of the expected numerous _",
    "mergers on the survival of thin disks is still debated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) account for about 80% of the star formation density reported at z@xmath61 @xcite , but their morphologies reveal that only half of z@xmath40.5 lirgs are compatible with mergers , while those in the other half appear to be spiral @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the large number density of lirgs at these epochs suggests that they could experience between two and four star formation bursts until z=0 , with typical timescales of @xmath00.1 gyr , which is not consistent with a simply continuous star formation history .",
    "they concluded that minor mergers , tidal interactions , or gas accretion remain plausible triggering mechanisms in distant lirgs harboring a spiral morphology .",
    "interestingly , 75% of local lirgs are barred , which could play a role in regulating star formation in such objects @xcite .    at higher redshifts (",
    "i.e. , z@xmath41 ) , the co - moving density of galaxy appears to be dominated by clumpy irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "interest for such objects dates back to @xcite , who first noticed the unusual aspects of some high - z galaxies , dubbed as `` chain galaxies '' and described as `` linearly organized giant star - forming regions '' .",
    "the large occurrence of blue star - forming knots in less edge - on objects was also later recognized as a general and intriguing feature of distant galaxies , probably linked to an early phase in the formation of local spiral galaxies @xcite , and were latter referred to as `` clump clusters '' by @xcite . the improved spatial resolution provided by the hst / acs re - invigorated the interest for these objects , which were all suggested to be different incarnations of the same underlying population viewed along different inclination angles",
    "both kind of objects are therefore often referred to as `` clumpy galaxies '' .",
    "they are found to be typically made of 5 - 10 kpc - sized clumps with stellar masses @xmath7 m@xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath0100 times more massive than the largest star complexes in present - day spiral galaxies ) , and they typically account for one third of the total galaxy emission @xcite .",
    "such clumps are thought to be linked to the formation of disks , as suggested by the increase of the inter - clump surface density , and the decrease of the mass surface density contrast between the clumps and the inter - clump regions , when going from clumpy galaxies with no evident inter - clump emission to clumpy galaxies with faint red disks , and spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "what is driving the formation of these clumps has been the subject of many attentions during the past decade .",
    "numerical simulations suggested that clumps might originate from the local gravitational instability of very gas - rich disks of young galaxies @xcite . due to their large masses , the clumps would experience strong dynamical friction and spiral towards the galaxy center within a few gyr , which might lead to the formation of a bulge @xcite , as well as a thick stellar disk through strong stellar scattering @xcite .",
    "simulated clumps are found to show properties similar to observations @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of these clumps is so short and the fraction of clumpy galaxies at z@xmath41 so high , that making the clumpy phase a long - term phenomenon requires a continuous and rapid fresh supply of cold gas in order to feed the disk and regenerate new clumps @xcite .",
    "theoretical developments indeed suggested that early galaxy formation is fed by cold streams penetrating through dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "these cold streams are expected to maintain a dense disk that can undergo gravitational fragmentation into several giant clumps @xcite .",
    "this possible link between high - z clumpy galaxies and the cosmological context was strengthened both by recent cosmological numerical simulations @xcite , and semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it was proposed that clumps could also result from on - going mergers or interactions @xcite .",
    "discriminating between the merger and fragmentation scenarii is not straightforward because it requires high - resolution integral field spectroscopy in high - z galaxies .",
    "indeed , as stated by @xcite , the most straightforward and powerful test for discriminating between the two hypothesis is to examine the kinematics of the clumps : in the merger scenario , a random orientation of clump spins is expected , while in the fragmentation scenario , clumps are expected to be coplanar .",
    "in particular , one interesting predictions of these simulations is that the large - scale rotation in the underlying disk should be preserved during the fragmentation phase @xcite .",
    "the achievement of integral field spectrograph working in the near infrared ( e.g. , sinfoni at the vlt , or osiris at keck ) , allowed several teams to gather spatially - resolved kinematic observations of z@xmath41 distant galaxies ( see @xcite and references therein , as well as @xcite ) .",
    "detection of an underlying rotation was claimed in several z@xmath02 clumpy galaxies , which has been used as a support to the fragmentation scenario @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , analysis of integral field spectroscopy observations suggest that two different scenarii might take place at z@xmath31 , and at z@xmath41 .",
    "it therefore becomes necessary to start investigating whether both scenarii are consistent , and whether or not a transition between two different galaxy evolution drivers is occurring between these two epochs . to this aim ,",
    "i take advantage of the images survey to study clumpy galaxies at z=0.6 .",
    "the goal is to investigate which of the merger or fragmentation scenario is the most consistent with z@xmath00.6 clumpy galaxies , and investigate whether clumpy galaxies at z@xmath31 and at z@xmath41 are driven by a common physical process .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 , i describe how the clumpy galaxies at z@xmath00.6 were selected ; in sect .",
    "3 , i present their kinematic and dynamical properties ; sect .",
    "4 discusses the origin of the clumpiness in distant galaxies ; sect .",
    "5 discusses the results , while conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "6 . throughout the paper ,",
    "i adopt @xmath9 km / s / mpc , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and the @xmath12 magnitude system .",
    "in this paper , i made use of the representative images sample of 63 emission line galaxies at z@xmath00.6 .",
    "the sample is fully described in @xcite , and i refer the reader to this paper for details .",
    "this sample was observed by flames / giraffe at the vlt , which allowed us to derived spatially - resolved kinematics for all these galaxies .",
    "the dynamical state of these galaxies was studied , according to which they were classified into three classes : rotating disks ( rds ) are galaxies showing regular rotation well - aligned along the morphological axis , perturbed rotators ( prs ) show a large - scale rotation with a local perturbation in the velocity dispersion map that can not be accounted for by rotation , while galaxies with complex kinematics ( cks ) do not show any large - scale rotation , or a strong misalignment between the dynamical and morphological axes @xcite .",
    "this classification takes into account the residuals between the observed vf and @xmath13-map and those predicted by a rotating - disk model ( see @xcite ) , which makes this classification objective and reproducible . for reasons of homogeneity , and to benefit from the most exquisite images from the acs camera on - board the hst , i limited myself to galaxies lying in the cdfs - goods field .",
    "this study is therefore based on a sample of 32 galaxies .",
    "note that this sample is still representative of z@xmath00.6 , intermediate - mass galaxies , as shown by @xcite .",
    "i selected clumpy galaxies following selection criteria depicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "specifically , i required for a galaxy to be clumpy to fulfil the following requirements :    \\(i ) showing at least three clumps in the rest - frame uv image . to check this , i used @xmath14-band hst / acs images , which corresponds to @xmath0270 nm rest - frame .",
    "note that @xcite used the observed @xmath15 band but at higher redshift ( see also @xcite ) , which also roughly matches the rest - frame uv for most of their clumpy galaxies ;    \\(ii ) absence of spatial features associated with spiral galaxies ( e.g. , central bulge ) ;",
    "\\(iii ) the underlying light profile must be inconsistent with an exponential disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , i discarded all galaxies where a sersic profile resulted in a good fit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , such a selection method is rather subjective . in order to stick to former studies of such galaxies at higher redshift",
    ", i nevertheless chose to keep these selection criteria and ignored further color and kinematic information from the images database .",
    "instead , this information was used _",
    "a posteriori _ to investigated whether the candidates selected this way were truly rotating and/or corresponded to jeans fragmentation processes .",
    "the selection was done independently by three member of the images consortium ( including the author ) , and results compared until a consensus was reached for each object .",
    "i ended up with a sample of 11 candidates , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ morpho ] . a visual comparison with fig .",
    "1 of @xcite confirms that all z@xmath00.6 candidates indeed look similar to higher - z clumpy galaxies .        since the images - cdfs sample is representative of z@xmath00.6 emission line galaxies , i can estimate the fraction of emission line clumpy galaxies at z@xmath00.6 , which is found to be 34@xmath218% , with error - bars due to poisson fluctuation in the parent sample",
    "this is in very good agreement with results from the udf at z@xmath31 , and a factor @xmath02 less than at z@xmath02 - 3 @xcite .",
    "if one accounts for the fact that emission line galaxies represent 60% of intermediate mass galaxies at z@xmath00.6 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , one finds that clumpy galaxies represent 20@xmath212% of intermediate - mass galaxies at this redshift .",
    "spatially - resolved kinematics was obtained , amongst others , for all of the 11 clumpy galaxies by @xcite . amongst them , five were found to be cks , four corresponded to pr , and two were classified as rds ( see appendix ) .",
    "rotation requires a significant inclination angle to be detected , ( i.e. , a face - on disk would not show any rotation due to projection effects ) .",
    "i checked that such projection effects do not affect the relative fraction of ck galaxies : considering the full sample of 63 images galaxies from @xcite , the fraction of face - on galaxies ( i.e. , having an inclination angle smaller than 30 degrees ) , is found to be 10 , 17 , and 13%@xmath28% amongst rd , pr , and ck galaxies , respectively .",
    "this rules out any significant bias due to such projection effects , even if it can not be excluded that a particular object might be affected .",
    "according to predictions from numerical models , jeans - fragmentation should preserve the rotation of the underlying disk ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that distant clumpy galaxies should in principle appear as rd or pr ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , clumps have diameters @xmath0kpc , while the giraffe ifu pixel size is 0.52 arcsec , which corresponds to 3.5 kpc at z=0.6 .",
    "therefore , the spatial scale of clumps remains well below the spatial resolution of giraffe observations .",
    "this means that all kpc - sized substructures are strongly smoothed by the giraffe ifu , and it is therefore expected that most jeans unstable disks show a clear large - scale rotation , possibly affected by perturbations7 kpc ) , while all kinematic disturbances are already strongly attenuated at the kpc scale .",
    "such a galaxy would clearly be classified as rd or pr , but not as ck because of the clear velocity gradient and the velocity dispersion peak located at the dynamical center . ] .",
    "it can not be excluded that due to a given particular orientation or a particularly large number of clumps , and due to the relatively coarse spatial resolution of the giraffe ifu , a given jeans - unstable disk could not be classified as a galaxy with a complex kinematics . however",
    ", this would require very strong perturbations in the morpho - kinematics at a level which does not appear to be representative of most clumpy disks observed at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find that 9% of intermediate - mass galaxies at z@xmath00.6 are ck clumpy galaxies .",
    "if clumps were strong enough to break a pre - existing disk , this would mean that such galaxies would result in elliptical galaxies .",
    "indeed , given the low level of cold gas accretion at z@xmath31 ( see sect .",
    "4.2 ) , there would be simply not enough fresh material available to reform a disk after its destruction .",
    "however , the fraction of elliptical galaxies does not evolve significantly over this redshift range @xcite .",
    "this implies that , if such strong clumps exist , they can not destroy completely the disk .",
    "hence , a rotation should be detected in such objects , particularly on large spatial scales , such as those probed by the giraffe ifu . to this respect , there is a sub - class of ck galaxies which deserves more attention .",
    "those are the galaxies which show a velocity gradient that might be associated with rotation , but which were classified as ck because of a significant misalignment between their kinematic and morphological main axes . in the sample of ck clumpy galaxies , only j033224.60 - 274428.1 belongs to this sub - class ( see fig .",
    "[ kin ] ) .",
    "such a particular case can not affect significantly the conclusions of this paper .",
    "the above suggests that a very large majority of z@xmath00.6 ck clumpy galaxies are not the result of jeans instability . actually , such a kinematics",
    "was rather associated with the result of major mergers , as suggested by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . during such processes",
    ", the gaseous phase can be compressed to column densities high enough to make the gas unstable , which can result in the formation of clump complexes , as shown by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite mentioned that stronger perturbations are expected to lead to a larger velocity dispersion and larger cloud complexes by gravitational instability .",
    "if clumpy galaxies classified as cks at z@xmath00.6 are the result of galaxy mergers , then one expects that their mass ratios , orbits , and merger phases correspond to the strongest perturbations , in terms of gas compression .",
    "@xcite conducted a systematic first - order modelling of z@xmath00.6 galaxies in the images - cdfs sample .",
    "they used hydrodynamical simulations from @xcite to infer for each galaxy a possible mass ratio , merger phase ( i.e. , before the first pass , between the first and second pass , nuclei fusion , etc . ) , and orbit .",
    "they used a limited base of reference simulations , but this is enough to infer first - order conditions for the progenitors . note that in two cases , a full modelling was carried out by @xcite and @xcite , which confirms the first - order model inferred by @xcite .",
    "for the five clumpy galaxies classified as cks , @xcite indeed found mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:1 , merging phases between the first passage and the nuclei fusion , and direct or inclined orbits , i.e. , the initial conditions that are expected to result in the strongest gas compression during the collision , as expected from numerical simulations of binary mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one might however object that clumpy galaxies with complex kinematics ( and more generally z@xmath00.6 ck galaxies in the parent sample ) do not necessarily show morphological features like tails , bridges , double nuclei , nearby companions , etc .",
    ", which are generally considered as clear evidences for mergers . however , it is important to realize that available images , and even those from the hst / acs , are not deep enough to guarantee a systematic detection of such features .",
    "for instance , with hst / acs images in the goods field , one would detect the optical radius of the mw only up to z  0.5 ( as inferred by redshifting r@xmath16 with s / n=3 in a 1.5 resolution element of acs ) . hence , z@xmath00.6 ( i.e. , 6 gyr ago ) is probably a limit for detecting such low surface brightness features , contrary to what is generally thought ( see also @xcite and their fig .",
    "therefore , the above - mentioned models can be considered as reasonable evidence that clumps in galaxies showing complex kinematics could be the result of gas compression induced by galaxy mergers .      in this section ,",
    "i investigate the stability of the six remaining clumpy galaxies that were classified as rds or prs , i.e. , those showing large - scale rotation .",
    "the instability of gravitational disks can be quantified using the toomre parameter @xmath1 @xcite . for a gravitational disk to fragment into clumps",
    ", it is required that @xmath17 , which means that the system is unstable to both radial and axisymmetric perturbations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for a pure gaseous disk , and at large galacto - centric radius ( i.e. , on the flat part of the rotation curve )",
    ", @xmath18 can be directly estimated from observables in the following way @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gas velocity dispersion , @xmath21 is the gas surface density , @xmath22 is the gas rotation velocity , and @xmath23 is the gas extension .",
    "@xmath22 were taken from @xcite , and @xmath23 from @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 was estimated following @xcite , i.e. , by inverting the schmidt - kennicutt law that relates the star formation rate and gas surface densities .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a complete description of the method .",
    "finally , @xmath20 were estimated following @xcite , i.e. , as a sigma - clipped mean over the velocity dispersion map , after having excluded the central pixel which , at the spatial resolution of the giraffe ifu , is strongly contaminated by the contribution of larger - scale motions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "however , the use of the parameter @xmath1 is complicated by the fact that real galaxies are ( at least at first order ) a two - phase medium , and can not be considered as pure stellar or gaseous systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , the median gas fraction in the images sample is 31% @xcite . in such mixed systems ,",
    "the gravitational interaction between the stellar and the gaseous phase makes the global system more unstable than the two phases considered individually @xcite . in this case",
    ", the stability of such systems can not be derived from @xmath18 alone , and one has to define an effective @xmath24 that takes into account the effect of both stars and gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "i used the first - order approximation derived by @xcite : @xmath25 with @xmath26 where the factor 1.3 in front of @xmath27 comes from the factor 1.4 in @xmath18 rescaled by @xmath28/3.36 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "i converted half - light radii @xmath29 derived by @xcite from z - band hst / acs images into total stellar radii @xmath30 using @xmath31 , which corresponds to the optical radius in thin exponential disks ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xmath32 was then derived using @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are stellar masses derived by @xcite in the images sample ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "i excluded contributions to stellar masses from bulges by rescaling the stellar mass using the bulge - to - total z - band light ratio b / t derived by @xcite .",
    "when no b / t could be measured , i assumed that all stars lie into a disk .",
    "i assumed that @xmath35 , as generally observed in local spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "finally , in distant star - forming galaxies , it is very likely that @xmath36 , because a significant fraction of stars were probably formed during the on - going starburst .",
    "the resulting @xmath18 , @xmath27 , and @xmath24 are shown in fig .",
    "[ stab ] . while the gaseous phase appears to be stable for the six clumpy galaxies , the contribution of @xmath27 makes them globally unstable to radial and azimuthal perturbations , i.e. , to clump formation .",
    "however , a global instability does not necessarily imply that both the stellar and gaseous phases will fragment .",
    "if the instability is not strong enough , only the gaseous phase ( eventually along with young hot o / b stars ) can fragment , while the stellar distribution ( i.e. , later type stars ) remains much smoother . to check this possibility ,",
    "i examine z - band images , which corresponds to rest - frame optical wavelengths ( i.e. , 5451 ) , for all the z@xmath00.6 clumpy galaxies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ zband ] .",
    "there is a strong trend in pr / rd clumpy galaxies to have their clumps vanishing in z band .",
    "this is in contrast with higher - z clumpy galaxies , for which it has been claimed that their morphologies do not change significantly at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "note that clumpy galaxies with complex kinematics tend to have persisting clumps in the red .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that clumps in these galaxies might result from merger - induced fragmentation , since , under this hypothesis , they were found to correspond to the strongest conditions in terms of gas compression ( see above ) .",
    "interestingly , all rds and prs in the images - cdfs sample lie downward the @xmath37 stability limit , while all do not harbor clumps , since this includes those that were not selected as clumpy galaxies based on their uv morphology ( see sect .",
    "this could be linked with the temporal evolution of instabilities in gas - rich disks .",
    "indeed , @xcite studied the behavior of @xmath18 , @xmath38 , and @xmath24 in gas - pure unstable disks .",
    "their simulations show that jeans - unstable disks are produced by early instabilities lasting a few 100 myr , and driven by the gaseous phase ( see their fig .",
    "conversely , instabilities first driven by the stellar phase tend to result in stellar bars or spiral arms , depending on the radius where the instability occurs .",
    "therefore , at least some of the z@xmath00.6 regular ( i.e. , not clumpy ) rd or pr galaxies could be associated with such initially star - driven instabilities , which will not result in clumps but will rather develop bars or spiral arms .",
    "this could also be due to a non - negligible contribution from the stellar mass by their stellar halo , which can easily contribute to stabilize a disk @xcite .     for the rotating disks ( blue dots ) and perturbed rotators ( green squares ) in the images - cdfs sample .",

    "the remaining clumpy galaxies , i.e. , which show large - scale rotation , are found to be toomre - stable in their gaseous phase , but unstable in their stellar phase , contrary to higher - z clumpy galaxies , which are found to be unstable in both phases , with a stronger level of effective instability .",
    "this could originate both in the likely higher fraction of old stars in z@xmath00.6 clumpy galaxies , which would not participate into the fragmentation process .",
    "this would naturally explain why z@xmath00.6 uv clumps tend to vanish when looking at reddest - band images , unlike z@xmath02 clumpy galaxies , which appear to be more persistent at longer wavelengths .",
    "while z@xmath41 clumpy galaxies were largely associated with jeans - unstable disks in the literature , i argue that current kinematic observations could actually support a fraction of only @xmath033% of such systems among z@xmath02 star - forming galaxies . while this is not incompatible with the cumulative fraction of major mergers in such objects over their past @xmath01 gyr , theoretical and numerical works suggested a different channel for disk fragmentation , which could result from cold flows from the inter - galactic medium penetrating through the surrounding dark matter halos .",
    "these cold flows could maintain the gaseous phase high enough to fragment and regenerate clumps at a rate high enough to be consistent with observations .",
    "the progressive shut down of these cold flows with redshift in massive haloes could also explain why the formation of z@xmath31 clumpy galaxies are found to be preferentially driven by interactions , since the duty cycle of merger would dramatically evolve between these two epochs . within this theoretical frame",
    ", there is therefore no contradiction between the interpretation of kinematic observations of z@xmath02 and of z@xmath00.6 galaxies .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether interactions could not account for all or at least most of the evolution seen in intermediate and massive galaxies all the way from z@xmath02 - 3 down to z=0 .",
    "confirming the nature and the fraction of high - z clumpy galaxies will require better spatial resolutions on larger telescopes .",
    "unfortunately , it is likely that such a debate will find a answer only with the advent of the extremely large telescopes and their associated nir integral field spectrographs such as eagle @xcite .",
    "this study made use of the goldmine and hyperleda databases ( see http://goldmine.mib.infn.it/ and http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/ ) .",

    "i also thank f. hammer and h. flores for their help in selecting clumpy galaxies in the images survey , which initiated this work .",

    "<S> roughly half of them ( 45@xmath230% ) have complex kinematics inconsistent with jeans - unstable disks , while those in the remaining half ( 55@xmath230% ) show large - scale rotations . </S>",
    "<S> the latter reveal a stable gaseous phase , but the contribution of their stellar phase makes them globally unstable to clump formation . </S>",
    "<S> clumpy galaxies appear to be less unstable at z@xmath00.6 than at z@xmath02 , which could explain why the uv clumps tend to vanish in rest - frame optical images of z@xmath00.6 clumpy galaxies , conversely to z@xmath02 clumpy galaxies , in which the stellar phase can substantially fragment . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the former correspond to patchy star - formation regions superimposed on a smoother mass distribution . a possible and widespread scenario for driving clump formation relies on instabilities by cold streams penetrating the dark matter halos where clumpy galaxies inhabit . </S>",
    "<S> while such a gas accretion process is predicted to be significant in massive , z@xmath02 haloes , it is also predicted to be strongly suppressed in similar , z@xmath00.6 haloes , which could explain why lowest - z clumpy galaxies appear to be driven by a different mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> instead , i found that interactions are probably the dominant driver leading to the formation of clumpy galaxies at z@xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> i argue that the nature of z@xmath41 clumpy galaxies remains more uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> while cold flows could be an important driver at z@xmath02 , i also argue that the _ observed and cumulative _ merger fraction between z=2 and z=3 is large enough so that every z@xmath02 galaxy might be the result of a merger that occurred within their past 1 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> i conclude that it is premature to rule out mergers as a universal driver for galaxy evolution from z@xmath02 down to z=0 .    </S>",
