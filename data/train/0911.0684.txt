    "while covering over a third of the sky , little is known about the nature of these clouds , with many suggestions as to their origin . while we now know the distances to a number of hvcs , their orbits are more difficult to determine . since its discovery in @xcite , the smith cloud was originally believed to be an extension of the galactic disk @xcite but it was later shown to be separated kinematically from the galactic disk @xcite leading to its subsequent classification as an hvc @xcite .    while the origin of the cloud is still unknown , with suggestions of gas belonging to an infalling dwarf galaxy @xcite or gas lifted from the galactic disk @xcite , the distance , mass and velocity of the cloud",
    "are now well established .",

    "the velocity components have also been determined @xcite allowing the orbit of the cloud to be calculated for the first time .",
    "the smith cloud s importance is that it provides insight into gas at a more advanced stage of accretion than the magellanic stream .",
    "earlier studies have shown how easily gas disrupts as it passes through a hot corona @xcite .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that a massive , high - velocity gaseous system has survived so close to the disk . in light of recent developments ,",
    "we consider the prospect of a confining dark halo surrounding at least some hvcs to be plausible , as first proposed by @xcite , and therefore worthy of further investigation .",
    "a number of ultra - faint dwarf galaxies have now been discovered in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "what is particularly striking is that the inferred dark halo mass exceeds @xmath11",

    "this factor also contributes to other halo properties such as the scale radius @xmath69 and the scale velocity @xmath70 .",
    "we consider two models of evolution , one in which the smith cloud is infalling for the first time , hereafter the infalling orbit models , and a second model where the smith cloud has already been maximally stripped due to previous orbits , hereafter the repeated orbit models .",
    "these both share common features : ( i ) they have the same trajectory today , ( ii ) the dark matter halo has been tidally stripped down from some larger initial mass ( @xmath71 ) in an identical fashion before our calculations commence at apogalacticon .",
    "the important distinction is tidal stripping of the gas is possible in the infalling orbit models but not in the repeated orbit models ; in both cases , ram pressure stripping by the hot halo is important . for each case , the evolution of the smith cloud is considered for the nfw , einasto and burkert models .",
    "the evolution of the model clouds was calculated as a function of three variables : the initial virial mass at the time of formation ( i.e. before the dark - matter halo fell into the galaxy ) , the dark matter profile at this time , and the initial hydrogen gas mass at apogalacticon .",
    "for both the repeated orbit model and infalling orbit models , the evolution of @xmath72 model clouds were calculated , corresponding to @xmath73 logarithmically spaced virial masses in the range @xmath74  m@xmath10 and @xmath75 logarithmically spaced gas masses in the range @xmath76  m@xmath10 .",
    "the orbit of the smith cloud was calculated using the position and velocity data from @xcite for the tip of the smith cloud : @xmath77  kpc , @xmath78  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the form of the galactic potential is given by @xcite normalized by a circular velocity of @xmath79  km  s@xmath5 at the solar circle .",

    "we investigate the effects of dynamical friction on the orbit trajectory .",
    "the formalism used is described by @xcite : we point out that the value for the circular velocity in their table 1 should be @xmath82 km s@xmath5 ( not 181 km s@xmath5 as quoted ) to be consistent with their analysis . but over the past few hundred million years , dynamical friction is found to have only minimal effect , even in the high mass limit .",
    "this is because , once again , the impact of gas loss from the subhalo close to the disk is found to dominate the evolution of the subhalo .",
    "we assume that any drag between the model clouds and the galactic corona is negligible and does not affect the orbit .",
    "each model cloud is considered to be a dark matter potential well filled with gas in isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we assume a primordial helium abundance @xmath83 and metallicity of @xmath84 .",
    "we also assume the gas has a temperature of @xmath85  k and adopt an ionization fraction of @xmath86 for the smith cloud , slightly below the newly updated h@xmath87/h@xmath88 ratio in @xcite .",
    "this temperature and ionization fraction then give a sound speed of @xmath89  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the gas is distributed in the potential well according to the gas density profile @xmath90 , where @xmath24 is the scale radius , @xmath20 is the halo circular velocity given by ( [ eq : vs ] ) and @xmath91 is given in table [ table : prof ] .    for the initial dimension of the model clouds , the sound crossing",
    "time is @xmath92  myr , falling to about @xmath93  myr at the disk .",
    "we therefore begin each orbit at the apogalacticon , approximately @xmath94  kpc from the galactic centre , which took place @xmath95  myr ago , and @xmath96  myr after the last transit of the disk .",
    "we hence assume the cloud has regained hydrostatic equilibrium by this point and is the basis for our initial assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium . due to the comparatively large sound crossing time",
    "we assume that the radial gas density profile does not change throughout the calculation , only being truncated , however , due to the lower sound crossing time at the disk we use a more restrictive condition as the cloud transits the disk (  [ sec : sac ] ) .    in order to trace the long - term impact of ram - pressure stripping",
    ", we must define the density profile of the hot coronal halo and the galactic gas disk .",
    "the acceleration due to the stellar density profile is already included in the wolfire potential . the galactic corona is assumed to be a mix of h@xmath97he at @xmath98  k with the density calculated from the gravitational potential of @xcite , normalized to a plasma density of @xmath99  @xmath31 at @xmath100  kpc from the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "the density profile of the hi  disk was calculated using an exponential drop - off in density both in the radial and vertical direction .",
    "we use the new prescription in @xcite which includes the vertical flaring of the outer disk .",
    "the smith cloud was evolved through a procedure that iteratively calculates the competing processes on the dark matter confined cloud .",
    "the initial radius of the gas comes from integrating the gas density profile over space giving ( modified from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath101 where @xmath25 is the scale radius of the halo , @xmath102 , @xmath103 is the gas distribution profile for constant scale velocity and sound speed .",
    "here we have replaced @xmath23 with @xmath104 by assuming that initially the outer edge of the halo is bound by thermal pressure from the galactic halo .    at each step",
    "we calculate whether the gas at the cloud edge is prone to stripping by examining if the force applied by the external medium exceeds the maximum gravitational force in the subhalo at a given radius . for an isothermal spherical cloud ,",
    "gas will be stripped if @xcite : @xmath105with @xmath106 and @xmath107 being the density of the galactic gas and the outer subhalo gas respectively , @xmath108 the relative velocity between these two gases , and @xmath109 the amount of mass within a radius @xmath110 . the mass within",
    "a radius @xmath110 comprises the dark matter subhalo @xmath111 and the gas within that radius @xmath112 .",

    "as @xmath115 tends to be much larger than the gas sound speed , @xmath22 , we assume that the density profile of the gas does not change , becoming truncated at the edge of the shock .    for infalling models , the tidal stripping must also be considered . at each step , the tidal radius and tidal mass of the subhalo are also calculated .",
    "the tidal radius is given by @xcite : @xmath116\\frac{m_{gal}(r)}{r^3},\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the distance between the centre of the subhalo and the galactic centre .",
    "any gas outside of the tidal radius @xmath117 will also be removed , with the new gas radius being the minimum of the tidal radius or the radius resulting from ram pressure stripping .",
    "the total mass can then be calculated by modifying ( [ eq : mass ] ) such that @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "the central column density is calculated using @xmath120 we iterate through the orbit in @xmath121  myr steps to determine the evolution of radius , mass and column density for the cloud / halo system .",
    "convergence was tested by iterating through on @xmath122  myr steps for some surviving clouds , with the smaller step size producing less than @xmath123 difference in mass calculations throughout the orbit .",
    "a special step , however , is considered when the smith cloud is moving through the galactic disk .",
    "consider a cloud with a gas density @xmath124 , radius @xmath125 moving at speed @xmath126 through the galactic halo .",
    "consider a gaseous disk where , at some radius , it has a local gas density @xmath127 and a half - scale height @xmath128 .",
    "will the cloud survive its transit through the disk ?",
    "we write down two shock conditions : one for the shock driven into the cloud by the disk , and one for the shock driven by the cloud into the disk .",
    "the cloud survives if the shock through the cloud takes longer to propagate than the shock through the disk .",
    "the shock propagates into the disk gas at speed @xmath129 and another into the cloud , at speed @xmath130 the shock needs to be fast enough to heat the disk gas significantly .",
    "the key to punching a hole is that the shock must go right through the disk gas before passing through the cloud . in other words",
    "we need roughly @xmath131 or equivalently @xmath132 .",
    "this leads to @xmath133 it follows that , to first order , the cloud will survive if @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the column densities of the cloud and the disk along the orbit respectively .",
    "this is the kinetic energy argument presented by @xcite .",
    "we note that the dark matter subhalo itself has negligible impact on the galactic gas .",
    "we therefore expect that all gas in the smith cloud at a column density less than @xmath137 is stripped when the cloud moves through the disk .",
    "as the passage through the disk occurs on a short timescale @xmath138  myr , we treat this removal of gas as instantaneous , and in addition to the normal ram pressure stripping that occurs during that time step .",
    "we also set our model disk to rotate with equal angular velocity to the smith cloud as it passes through at @xmath139  kpc , and a static disk otherwise .",
    "although this choice is unphysical and in both cases contradict , the observed relative velocity between the smith cloud and the ism , the cloud spends only a short time near the disk , and hence any additional gas stripped via ram pressure will contribute only a small correction to the mass lost from the cloud near the disk .",
    "in our simulations , a large number of model clouds survive to the present day , although not all of these are similar to the smith cloud as observed today .",
    "we interpret our results graphically through contour plots of properties derived from the mass , radius and column density of the model clouds .",
    "the simplest properties @xmath140 mass , column density @xmath140 are displayed for the repeated orbit model nfw profile in fig . [ fig : nfwcont ] . by removing model results which are greatly dissimilar to those observed for the smith cloud",
    ", we can find an allowed parameter space for the initial cloud properties ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smith ] ) . in figs . 4 - 7",
    ", we present our results in terms of the mass of the tidally - stripped subhalo rather than the mass of the initial infalling halo .",
    "the lower limit of the allowed parameter space is found by requiring the amount of gas in the model clouds to match the observations .",
    "the smith cloud has an hi  mass of at least @xmath141  m@xmath10 @xcite , and at least as much again in hii @xcite , giving a final gas mass of at least @xmath142  m@xmath10 .",
    "the excluded region corresponding to lower cloud gas masses is shown in green ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smith ] ) bounded by a solid black line .",
    "we include several upper bounds to the allowed parameter space .",
    "the universal baryonic to dark matter mass fraction is @xmath143 from the latest microwave background observations.cdm cosmology with parameters ( @xmath144 while there may be galaxies that exceed this limit ( e.g. dwarf galaxies that form in tidal tails of strong mergers ) , it is reasonable to assume that on average most dark matter subhalos do not accrete more than this fraction .",
    "thus , we can probably exclude all clouds with baryon to dark matter mass fractions above this limit , displayed by the red shaded region bounded by a dot - dash line in fig .",
    "[ fig : smith ]",
    ".    in dwarf galaxies , the highest hi  column densities seen outside of star - forming regions are always less than @xmath145  @xmath146 .",
    "this critical column density is found in regions with @xmath147 of optical emission ( b. ekta 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "since no stars are observed in the smith cloud , we include this upper limit to the hi  column density , shown by the light blue region bounded by a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : smith ] .",
    "an extensive literature demonstrates that star formation is intimately associated with the presence of molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for a canonical hvc metallicity of about @xmath148  z@xmath10 , it is unlikely that molecular gas can be measured directly from the smith cloud with existing submillimetre telescopes @xcite .",
    "this sets a stronger , but presumably less rigorous constraint on the allowed regions of the smith cloud ; the excluded regions are shown in purple bounded by a dot - dash line in fig . [ fig : smith ] .",

    "we have assumed that the gas was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium with the profile only being truncated and not altered further ; shocks that substantially modify the profile are associated with gas that gets stripped .",
    "the nfw and einasto profiles restrict the allowed regions of the cloud to a narrow range of initial gas masses and subhalo masses , with the subhalo mass range restricted to @xmath149  m@xmath10 and gas mass initially @xmath150  m@xmath10 , although we note that the allowed gas mass range is much larger at smaller subhalo masses than at the higher mass end . by comparison to the gas mass present today",
    ", the smith cloud will have lost between @xmath86 and @xmath151 of the gas present at apogalacticon .",
    "a large fraction of this gas loss in all model clouds is due to the transit of the disk suggesting , suggesting that the smith cloud may not survive the next passage through the disk .",
    "the tidal stripping of dark matter does not substantially affect the gas contained in the model clouds , with the gas contained within the protected core of the potential well . in the infalling orbit models",
    ", the smith cloud will also have lost approximately @xmath86 of the dark matter mass as well to tidal stripping , although most of this mass loss will have occurred before the semi - analytic calculations were begun .",
    "this scenario of an hvc infalling for the first time , possibly after interacting with a third body , such as a dwarf galaxy , has the potential to increase the baryonic to dark matter ratio above the universal fraction , particularly if the orbit avoided dense sections of the disk .",
    "the burkert profile retains a lower column of gas , due to a lower central density , with the effect that the region is not as well constrained as in the case of a nfw or a einasto profile .",
    "it is this lower column that leads to a higher mass requirement in order to survive traversal of the disk , which is dictated by the column density of the cloud .",
    "we display the mass history of three infalling orbit model clouds corresponding to the same input parameters for each dark - matter profile ( m@xmath152  m@xmath10 [ m@xmath153  m@xmath10 ] , m@xmath155=@xmath13  m@xmath10 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : massloss ] .",
    "the hydrostatic pressure bound gas radius is located within the tidally protected core of the dark matter subhalo , and therefore the mass history of the repeated orbit model with the same initial conditions will be similar .",

    "we have modelled the smith cloud by assuming that it is supported against total disruption by a dark - matter subhalo . by considering the evolution of this system over the past @xmath95  myr",
    ", we are able to compare our predicted properties to the known properties of the smith cloud today . under the assumption of dark - matter confinement",
    ", the subhalo encompassing the smith cloud has a tidal mass of @xmath156  m@xmath10 at the present time .",
    "even before this subhalo arrived at its present orbit , it will have lost @xmath157% of its dark matter and a comparable amount of progenitor gas due to tidal and ram pressure stripping by the galaxy . in this respect , the likelihood of an infalling ( dark - matter confined ) `` smith cloud '' event is comparable to the rate of dwarf galaxy infall , i.e. roughly one event per gyr .    if the nfw and einasto profiles are appropriate descriptions of dark matter halos , we find that the smith cloud can only exist in a narrow strip of the available parameter space defined by the initial dark matter subhalo mass and the initial gas mass .",
    "this remains true with and without dark matter stripping .",
    "this narrow strip also appears , albeit shifted with respect to the present axes , if the galactic halo is considered to be @xmath158 over or underdense from our model setup , or if the dark matter containing subhalo was virialized at an earlier redshift and correspondingly is denser than a subhalo virialized today .",
    "consistent with our picture , the observed wake in fig .",
    "1 presumably resulted from ablation processes due to the impulsive shock of the disk transit .",
    "we note with interest that the wake flares ( i.e. expands transverse to the direction of the wake ) beyond the putative dark matter core ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in our picture , this can be understood in the context of a transsonic flow .",
    "the smith cloud is moving at up to 300  km s@xmath5  with respect to a hot halo with adiabatic sound speed @xmath159200  km s@xmath5  making the cloud - halo interface mildly supersonic .",
    "once the stripped gas is left behind , it must undergo mixing with the hot halo through kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , causing the stream to expand perpendicular to the flow .",
    "the temperature of the hi  gas is predicted to rise along the wake . unless the confining core - dominated",
    ", dark matter halo is very massive , we do not expect the declining potential seen by the wake material to influence the degree of flaring .",
    "these issues are being addressed in new hydrodynamical simulations of the smith cloud that we will present elsewhere .    with respect to further constraints on shock interactions",
    ", we expect that shock signatures at uv to x - ray wavelengths will have largely faded away , and the hi  `` hole '' at the crossing point will have been substantially stretched by differential shear . for cloudlets smaller",
    "than 100 pc , thermal conduction due to the halo corona @xcite and the galactic radiation field convert the ablated gas to a clumpy plasma .",
    "we therefore strongly encourage more extensive mapping of the hi  and the ionized gas .",
    "as we discuss elsewhere @xcite , it is very difficult to see how the smith cloud , like several other large hvcs , could have come in from , say , the distance of the magellanic stream .",
    "this was our motivation for considering a cloud stabilised against disruption by a confining dark matter halo .",
    "in essence , we have considered the prospect that the smith cloud constitutes a ` dark galaxy ' where star formation never took place .",
    "any evidence of a co - moving stellar population would have profound consequences .",
    "an essential requirement for star formation to occur appears to be the presence of molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we envisage much deeper searches for the presence of molecular gas in compact hvcs , in particular , with the newly commissioned _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ on the _ hubble space telescope_.    our model is not unique .",

    "<S> the smith cloud is a massive system of metal - poor neutral and ionized gas ( m@xmath0 @xmath1  m@xmath2 ) that is presently moving at high velocity ( v@xmath3 @xmath4  300  km  s@xmath5 ) with respect to the galaxy at a distance of 12  kpc from the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the cloud s cometary tail indicates that the gas is in the process of accretion onto the galaxy , as first discussed by @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we re - investigate the cloud s orbit by considering the possibility that the cloud is confined by a dark matter halo . </S>",
    "<S> this is required for the cloud to survive its passage through the galactic corona . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three possible models for the dark matter halo ( nfw , einasto , burkert ) including the effects of tidal disruption and ram - pressure stripping during the cloud s infall onto and passage through the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> for the nfw and einasto dark - matter models , we are able to determine reasonable initial conditions for the smith cloud , although this is only marginally possible with the burkert model . </S>",
    "<S> for all three models , the progenitor had an initial ( gas+dark matter ) mass that was an order of magnitude higher than inferred today . in agreement with @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the cloud appears to have punched through the disk @xmath4  70  myr ago . for our most successful models , </S>",
    "<S> the baryon to dark matter ratio is fairly constant during an orbital period but drops by a factor of @xmath6 after transiting the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the cloud appears to have only marginally survived its transit , and is unlikely to retain its integrity during the next transit @xmath4  30  myr from now . </S>"
