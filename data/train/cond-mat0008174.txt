    "when boarding passengers , airline personnel usually call a limited number of rows at a time  `` now seating rows 20 to 30 ! ''  to ensure an efficient and orderly filling of the aircraft .",
    "nevertheless , there are always some hurried individuals who unduly join the forming line before their row is called , only to be rebuked by the flight attendant . in most instances the line",
    "is barely disrupted , while in some cases , such as delayed flights , the `` avalanching '' of disobedient passengers creates a long , disorderly line , absorbing nearly everyone .",
    "why is this ?",
    "let us consider the mechanism by which the line forms in greater detail .",
    "first , the forty or so passengers whose rows have been called move toward the gate , initiating a line . next",
    ", a few `` impatients '' ( or `` disobedients '' ) add to the ranks , and perhaps also some absent - minded physicists who stand up as soon as they hear an announcement and innocently approach the gate . seeing this",
    ", some of the people still sitting and waiting calmly , might lose their patience and decide to join the growing line .",
    "this `` domino effect '' may die out very soon , with just a few outsiders hiding in the queue , or it may continue , resulting in a catastrophic boarding process .",
    "the line formation at a boarding gate incorporates all the elements of a _ breakdown phenomenon _",
    "@xcite : it involves a large number of elements ( individuals ) , each in one of several possible states ( sitting or in line ) , which interact ( the longer the line , the stronger the temptation ) , and are driven as a whole ( calls of the flight attendant ) . furthermore",
    ", different people have different `` obedience thresholds '' that depend on their personality , mood , schedule , etc . for a given length of the line ,",
    "a fraction of these thresholds are crossed and the resulting disobedients stand up and move toward the gate .",
    "equivalently , a sitting individual decides to stand up and join the queue with some probability ( dependent on the line s length ) , thereby introducing an element of stochasticity , or _",
    "disorder_. similar features are present in a great variety of processes , occurring , for example , in materials under tension @xcite , conductors with an imposed current @xcite , magnets driven by an applied field@xcite , and social phenomena such as the `` boarding - gate problem . ''",
    "the rupture of the material , destruction of the conductor , macroscopic flipping of the magnetization , or the failure of the social process , respectively , can be viewed as a breakdown of the system .",
    "the present paper aims to draw a simple quantitative picture of breakdown phenomena in disordered systems , unifying the various realizations into a single formalism while still allowing for the details that distinguish each case .",
    "the most drastic simplification underlying our approach is its `` mean - field '' nature , which relies on average quantities by ignoring fluctuations and , consequently , any idea of locality or modulated spatial correlation .",
    "although such a crude description can depart significantly from three - dimensional reality , it is often accurate in higher dimensions and establishes a coarse framework which may then be refined to include fluctuations ( perturbatively )",
    ". nevertheless , some systems , such as magnets with long - range interactions or the boarding - gate line , are properly described by a mean - field theory ; in the , for example , any notion of locality is absent from the interactions , as any passenger can see the line as well as any other .    in addition to differences intrinsic to various examples , our approach should allow for the introduction of more than one type of disorder , as even a given system s behavior might very well depend on the character of the stochasticity present .",
    "better , we would like to divide all the possible disorder distributions into classes , each associated with a distinct qualitative behavior . to achieve this",
    ", we use a graphical scheme@xcite where we can _ draw _ different disorder distributions , enabling us to handle the latter in a very general fashion , without reference to a particular analytical or numerical form , and to distinguish the features relevant to the breakdown phenomenon@xcite .",
    "these features define the various `` universality classes , '' identified by one of their ( drawn ) members or by a generic statement ( for example , `` the class of all _ continuous _ distributions '' ) .",
    "a graphical method also avoids the possible misconceptions of a more specific treatment@xcite . indeed ,",
    "if the qualitative behavior of a physical system changes upon making a particular , for example , gaussian , distribution wider , what is the associated key feature ? is it the variance of the gaussian or its maximum value ? finally , a graphical scheme allows us to `` follow '' the state of the system as it is driven , thus capturing the whole breakdown phenomenon in a single picture .",

    "v , we introduce the notion of effective ( or phenomenological ) theory , a broader framework than the models examined .",
    "we return to the discussion of driven magnets in this more general context by constructing a simple effective theory suited to the problem , and mention some natural extensions to richer , non - mean - field approaches . finally , we conclude ( sec .",
    "vi ) with a summarizing picture and a brief allusion to dynamics .",
    "the democratic fiber bundle model was introduced by peirce@xcite in 1926 , and formalized and studied in greater detail by daniels@xcite in 1945 .",
    "it consists of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) fibers pulled by a force @xmath2 which they share uniformly ( democratically ) . as the force is increased , a fiber breaks if the stress it undergoes exceeds a threshold ( or strength ) , drawn from a distribution @xmath3 .",
    "after each set of failures , the total force is redistributed over the remaining fibers . as members of the _ british cotton industry research association _ and the _ wool industries research association _ , respectively , peirce and daniels sought a more fundamental understanding of the ` hank ' and ` lea ' tests for wool and cotton yarns , in which a hank ( or bundle ) is stretched between two hooks until it ruptures .",

    "realistic descriptions of fractures and earthquakes may lie anywhere between this democratic or infinite - range limit embodied by the , also sometimes referred to as the `` global - load - sharing '' or `` equal - load - sharing '' model , and the local or short - range limit , the `` local - load - sharing '' model@xcite , in which the stress released by a broken bond is passed on to its immediate ( intact ) neighbors .",
    "far from being one - dimensional or democratic , real - world systems may be ( effectively ) two- or three - dimensional , with connectivity properties that lead to a more complicated and richer picture . alluding to the applicability of the model to the testing of a cloth sample rather than a hank , daniels himself recognized@xcite that `` in closely woven fabrics the cross - threads afford a measure of support which introduces complications . ''    beyond the obvious question of the bundle s strength ( maximum sustainable stress without full rupture ) addressed by peirce@xcite and daniels@xcite ,",
    "we would like to uncover , in the large @xmath0 limit , its behavior characterized by the number @xmath4 of intact fibers as the force @xmath2 increases from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we investigate the critical properties of the fiber bundle upon approaching a macroscopic failure , and the generic classes in which they fall .    upon incrementing the force from @xmath7 to @xmath2 , a few fibers whose thresholds",
    "have been overshot , break . as a result ,",
    "the stress increases on the remaining intact fibers , leading to a secondary set of failures .",
    "this triggers a tertiary set of failures , and so on , until the bundle stabilizes at a non - vanishing @xmath4 or snaps off as a whole ( @xmath8 ) .",

    "as the force is increased , the straight line becomes steeper and the abscissa @xmath28 of the intersection point moves to the left .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the graphical scheme for three successive increments of the force .",
    "first , @xmath29 is switched from 0 to @xmath30 ; for @xmath31 , the straight line is flat and intersects @xmath22 at @xmath24 ( as expected from @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 .",

    "finally , @xmath29 is switched to @xmath38 , and the iterations lead all the way to @xmath23 , which corresponds to a fully ruptured bundle .",
    "if the force , rather than suddenly switching from @xmath30 to @xmath35 , goes through several intermediary steps , @xmath39 successively converges to the abscissa of the corresponding intersection points , but again ends up at @xmath40 when @xmath41 .",

    "although this divergence in the response is still reminiscent of a second - order transition , the situation differs from the usual case where the order parameter ( here @xmath4 ) is continuous at the singularity . to avoid any confusion",

    "clearly , by having more `` bumps '' ( @xmath75 on fig .",

    "an _ abrupt _ rupture of the bundle _ with no divergence in the breaking rate _ preceding it is possible only if @xmath22 has a non - differentiable point ( fig .",
    "4)@xcite , which in turn requires a discontinuity in @xmath78 .",
    "thus , abrupt failures in this mean - field model , far from being a generic feature associated with narrow disorder distributions , are an artifact of a singular point in @xmath78 .",

    "5 ) that if @xmath89 , the entire bundle snaps off abruptly at @xmath90 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath91 it undergoes an abrupt failure at @xmath92 leaving the @xmath93 stronger fibers intact , and then ruptures completely ( again abruptly ) when the force reaches @xmath94 .",

    "`` brittle '' media are characterized by a sudden failure due to the coalescence of many microcracks . in the context of our mean - field model",
    ", we may identify abrupt failures from markedly discontinuous distributions ( such as narrow finite - support ones or bimodal ones ) with brittleness , and soft failures from the continuous distributions of classes ( _ ii _ ) and ( _ iii _ ) with ductility .",
    "thus the character of a medium s strength depends on the _ shape _ of the distribution of randomness .    the failure of an element , whether a fiber in an elevator rope or a patch of a tectonic plate , is often accompanied by the emission of a sound@xcite . before an abrupt failure , nothing unusual",
    "is heard , whereas an increasingly loud noise is produced by a soft failure .",

    "the similarity between the breaking of a fiber bundle and the growth of a boarding - gate line becomes more apparent through the following mapping of the degrees of freedom , disorder , driving agent , and coupling : @xmath95 nevertheless , the two problems are different in that the stress applied to any one intact fiber is inversely proportional to their total number , whereas the temptation here grows with the length of the line .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity we focus on a single call of the flight attendant , say the first one . in the language of the , this corresponds to switching the force from zero to some value , and leaving it there .",
    "finally , the `` thermodynamic limit '' we treat ( in implicitly assuming infinitely many passengers ) may be a poor approximation for a situation involving a few dozen or a few hundred people .",
    "the fact that the first group of passengers called , and consequently the ones still waiting , may not be representative of the overall threshold distribution , for example , is one of the possibly important finite - size effects neglected .",

    "the collective motion of hundreds or millions of particles is reduced to that of their center of mass , that is , to a local average , which smears out a large number of details and fine characteristics , leaving a framework with a smaller number of variables than the original one . typically , a fluid is then described by fields of density , velocity vector , and temperature  five quantities associated with each point in space and time substitute for the many molecular degrees of freedom around that point .",
    "a delicate question relates to how much of the finer print , or _ fluctuations , _ needs to be included for an accurate description of a given phenomenon at a given length scale .",
    "various effective theories may be constructed to describe a given system , the ones with the fewest allowed fluctuations being termed `` mean - field .
