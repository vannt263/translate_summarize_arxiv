    "luminous ellipticals in the central regions of rich clusters are the most massive galaxies ( @xmath810@xmath9m@xmath4 ) at the present - day .",
    "the stars in these galaxies are metal - rich , old and surprisingly uniform : spectral analysis of typical @xmath10 ellipticals indicates luminosity - weighted ages of @xmath11811gyrs and hints that those at larger radii in clusters may be slightly younger ( e.g.  nelan et al .",
    "2005 ; smith et al .",
    "this homogeneity in their stellar populations means that these galaxies show a `` red sequence ''  a tight correlation between luminosity and colour which can be traced in clusters out to high redshifts ( e.g.  ellis et al .",
    "the existence of a red sequence of passive galaxies in a cluster signals that most of these galaxies were formed at least @xmath1112gyrs prior to the epoch at which the cluster is observed , although the presence of dust reddened , star - forming galaxies can confuse this interpretation .",

    "the striking decline in the galaxy population on the passive red sequence at @xmath131 implies a corresponding increase in the population of massive , star - forming galaxies in clusters at these epochs .",

    "however , submm surveys of the core regions of @xmath120.51 clusters , have uncovered a population of ultra / luminous infrared galaxies in these environments ( best 2002 ; webb et al .",
    "2005 ; noble et al .",
    "these surveys used scuba to map @xmath112@xmath16-diameter ( @xmath111mpc ) fields in the cores of around a dozen clusters at @xmath51 and found a substantial number of ultraluminous starburst galaxies .",

    "the _ herschel _ satellite has expanded the number of sensitive far - infrared surveys for ulirgs in distant clusters , strengthening the evidence for a continued rise out to at least @xmath51 , with a few rare examples at @xmath51.41.6 ( popesso et al .",

    "these instruments allow sensitive far - infrared / submm surveys over wide areas necessary to determine if there is a continued increase in the starburst population outside cluster cores ( as seen in the mid - infrared studies at lower redshift ) .",
    "we have therefore exploited new deep submm and far - infrared imaging from scuba-2 and spire of the field around the cluster cl0218.3@xmath10510 at @xmath01.62 to investigate the active galaxy populations in this region .",

    ". however , the interpretation in terms of star formation of the mid - infrared emission from galaxies in this @xmath71.62 structure is particularly difficult as the mips 24-@xmath17 m filter samples not only the redshifted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) feature at 7.7@xmath17 m , which is expected to trace star formation , but also the 9.7-@xmath17 m silicate absorption feature which is strong in obscured agn or particularly dense starbursts .",
    "the goal of this work is therefore is to build upon these earlier studies by undertaking a survey of the far - infrared and submm emission from luminous star - forming galaxies within the cluster and its surroundings and so investigate the evolutionary state of the galaxy populations in this structure .",
    "we note that two days before this paper was accepted , a similar analysis was presented by santos et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , using similar spire , mips , photometric and [ oii ] samples .",
    "the main differences between the two analyses are that we include scuba-2 in our far - infrared analysis , radio and mips catalogs in our deblending and an independent photometric redshift analysis .",
    "santos et al .  come to broadly similar conclusions to those presented here .",

    "all quoted magnitudes are on the ab system and errors on median values are derived from bootstrap resampling .",
    "our analysis involves both scuba-2 850@xmath17 m observations and _ herschel _ spire maps at 250500@xmath17 m to provide a census of the far - infrared / submm population in our survey area . to locate the counterparts to these sources ( where the maps have relatively poor spatial resolution ) we also use observations at higher spatial resolution in the radio and mid - infrared from the vla and _ spitzer _ respectively . finally , to determine if these counterparts are probable members of the @xmath01.6 structure in this field we use redshift information from spectroscopic and photometric redshifts , as well as narrow - band imaging of this field .",
    "we now describe each of these elements of the analysis .      as part of the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey ( s2cls )",
    "observations with scuba-2 were obtained in band 2 and upper - band 3 weather conditions ( @xmath240.050.10 ) between 2011 october and 2013 february . to - date these total 130hours of on - sky integration .",

    "this involves the raw data being first flat - fielded using ramps bracketing every science observation and then scaling the data to units of pw .",
    "the dynamic iterative map maker assumes that the signal recorded by a bolometer is a linear combination of : i ) a common mode signal dominated by atmospheric water and ambient thermal emission ; ii ) the astronomical signal ( attenuated by atmospheric extinction ) ; and iii ) a noise term , reflecting any additional signal not accounted for by i ) or ii ) .",
    "the map maker attempts to solve for these components , refining the model until convergence is met , an acceptable tolerance has been reached , or a fixed number of iterations has been exhausted .",
    "this yields time series signals for each bolometer that ought to comprise just the astronomical signal , corrected for extinction , plus noise .",
    "filtering of the time series is performed in the frequency domain , with band - pass filters equivalent to angular scales of @xmath262120@xmath25 .",
    "the reduction also includes the usual filtering steps of spike removal ( @xmath2710-@xmath28 deviations in a moving boxcar ) and dc step corrections .",
    "the signal from each bolometer s time series is then projected onto a map , using the scan pattern , with the contribution to a given pixel weighted according to its time - domain variance ( which is also used to estimate the @xmath29 tolerance in the fit derived by the map maker ) . throughout the iterative map making process , bad bolometers ( those significantly deviating from the model )",
    "are flagged and do not contribute to the final map .",
    "maps from independent scans are co - added in an optimal stack using the variance of the data contributing to each pixel to weight spatially - aligned pixels .",
    "the average exposure time per 4@xmath25 pixel in the central @xmath300.9degree - diameter region is @xmath301.5ks .",
    "finally , since we are interested in ( generally faint ) extragalactic point sources , we apply a beam matched filter to improve point source detectability , resulting in a map with a noise level of 1.9mjy rms .    for calibration",
    "we adopt the sky opacity relation for scuba-2 which has been obtained by fitting extinction models to hundreds of standard calibrators observed since the commissioning of scuba-2 ( dempsey et al .",
    "the flux calibration for scuba-2 data has been examined by analysing all flux calibration observations since summer 2011 until the date of observation . the derived beam - matched flux conversion factor ( fcf )",
    "has been found to be reasonably stable over this period , and the average fcfs agree ( within error ) with those derived from the subset of standard calibrators observed on the nights of the observations presented here .",
    "therefore we have adopted the canonical calibration of @xmath31537@xmath3226jybeam@xmath23pw@xmath23 here .",
    "a correction of @xmath3010 per cent is included in order to compensate for flux lost due to filtering in the blank - field map .",
    "this is estimated by inserting a bright gaussian point source into the time stream of each observation to measure the response of the model source to filtering .    the observed @xmath33@xmath34 distribution for the confirmed and probable cluster members identified by their different selection techniques ( see  2.4 ) .",
    "these observables roughly map to @xmath35@xmath36 in the restframe at @xmath37 .",
    "most of the photometric members define a blue cloud , which is also seen in the [ oii ] emitters , with the remainder inhabiting a more luminous and redder clump at @xmath381.5 .",
    "the far - infrared / submm - detected and the mips / radio sources are distributed very differently , with most of them having redder colors and brighter restframe @xmath39-band luminosities than the less - active populations .",
    "we also mark the six statistically - associated [ oii ] counterparts to five of the scuba-2 sources , which have much bluer colors than the bulk of the spire / scuba-2 counterparts and which we exclude from our analysis ( see  2.5 ) .",
    "finally , we compare the distribution of galaxies to that predicted by the millennium simulation ( see  3.1 ) using the galaxy evolution model of font et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , where the number density of sources in the theoretical model is shown as contours starting at 5 per cent of the peak density and incremented by 10 per cent .",
    "while the model successfully reproduces the colors of the bulk of the star - forming galaxies , it clearly underpredicts the number of the reddest and brightest galaxies , both passive and active .    to identify the submm sources , we search the beam - convolved signal - to - noise ratio map for pixels above a threshold @xmath40 .",
    "if a pixel is found , we record the peak - pixel sky coordinate , flux density and noise and mask - out a circular region equivalent to @xmath301.5@xmath18 the size of the 15@xmath25 beam at 850@xmath17 m .",
    "we then reduce @xmath41 by a small amount and repeat the search .",
    "the catalog limit , below which we no longer trust the reality of `` detections '' is the signal - to - noise level at which the contamination rate due to false detections ( expected from pure gaussian noise ) exceeds 5 per cent , corresponding to a significance of @xmath423.75 ( we confirm this using the simulations described next ) .",
    "we detect 97 discrete point sources above this significance within the survey area used in this analysis ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the completeness of our catalog is estimated by injecting artificial point sources into a blank map with the same noise properties as our real map . to create this map",
    "we apply a jackknife approach and randomly invert half of the individual time series before co - addition ( e.g.  weiss et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the recovery rate of 10@xmath43 sources ( inserted in groups of ten with fluxes drawn from a uniform distribution ) then gives the completeness function .",
    "these simulated maps also allow us to estimate the noise - dependent flux boosting that occurs for sources with true fluxes close to the noise limit of the map , and so we can determine a statistical correction to de - boost the fluxes measured of sources in the real map ; typically this correction is @xmath4410% .",
    "finally , the source detection algorithm is applied to each of the jackknife maps with no fake sources injected in order to evaluate the false positive rate , which we find to be 5 per cent , in agreement with the false detection rate expected for a map of this size assuming fluctuations from pure gaussian noise .",
    "we also stack both the scuba-2 maps and the spire maps described below , to derive statistical measurements of the typical far - infrared / submm luminosities of the less active cluster populations .",
    "this stacking involves extracting thumbnail maps around each source to be stacked and then median - combining these , before measuring the average source flux for the sample .      in our analysis",
    "we are seeking to identify far - infrared / submm sources which are potential members of the @xmath01.6 structure around cl0218.3@xmath10510 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the far - infrared / submm data is typically poor ( 1530@xmath25 fwhm ) and several of these maps are also confused . hence to locate the sources of emission at these wavelengths we need to use observations with higher spatial resolution , but in wavebands where there is likely to be a correspondence with the far - infrared / submm emission .",
    "the most commonly employed proxies for this purpose are the radio and mid - infrared ( e.g.  ivison et al .  1998 ; 2004 ) .",

    "this is in the opposite sense to the trend we see and we attribute this to one of three potential causes .",
    "firstly , our catalog of far - infrared / submm sources ( drawn from a 30@xmath18 larger area than that analysed by tran et al . ) could either suffer significant contamination from non - members , which would appear predominantly in the lower - density regions , or the incompleteness in our selection could mean we are missing far - infrared / submm bright members in the higher - density regions . both of these effects would reduce / remove any trend of increasing activity in higher - density regions .",
    "however , we discount the latter as there are few candidate far - infrared / submm sources at any redshift seen in projection within the higher - density regions .",
    "this leaves dilution due to contamination as a potential source of the disagreement , although we note that this would imply a much lower level of far - infrared / submm activity in this structure than suggested by either the trend in figure  6 or the visibility of the structure in the redshift distribution of far - infrared / submm sources in figure  1 .",
    "hence we next consider the other two explanations , the first of which arises from the fact that tran et al.s study relies on 24-@xmath17 m luminosity ( restframe 9@xmath17 m ) to infer sfrs . as we have discussed earlier",
    "this is an uncertain assumption at @xmath71.6 owing to the mix of continuum , pah emission and silicate absorption included in the mips passband and indeed we see no correlation at all between 24-@xmath17 m flux and far - infrared luminosity for the sources in our sample .",
    "hence the trend observed by tran et al",
    ".  could have its origin in variations in either sfr , agn contribution or hot / cold dust luminosity ratio with environment ( e.g.  rawle et al .",
    "in addition , tran et al .  used the 10@xmath102-nearest neighbor in their sample to determine the galaxy density in their analysis , this provides a more local estimate of environment ( on @xmath30100-kpc scales in the densest regions ) than our use of the density field of photometrically - selected members smoothed on 1.6-mpc scales , it is also more sensitive to contamination by interlopers in the galaxy sample . nevertheless , if we adopt their approach we find that some of the far - infrared / submm sources appear to reside in denser environments , especially when using a smaller number of neighbors to assess the environment ( e.g.  5@xmath102-nearest ) .",
    "thus the behaviour that tran et al .",
    "see may be driven by small - scale density enhancements in the very local environment of the most active galaxies , rather than providing an indication of enhanced activity in higher - density environments when defined on a larger scale .",
    "indeed , such small - scale associations of galaxies could be responsible for triggering the activity in the far - infrared / submm sources through interactions and mergers .",
    "we conclude that the discrepancy between our results and those in tran et al .  may have its origin in either the small size of their study , their reliance on restframe 9-@xmath17 m luminosity to infer sfr or their use of a local measure of environment , which is more sensitive to transient , small - scale clustering than our global measure .",
    "while we have seen that there is an enhanced level of star formation activity in the @xmath01.6 cluster cl0218.3@xmath10510 , compared to clusters at lower redshifts , we can also test if that activity is occuring in the densest regions of the cluster ( as claimed by tran et al .",
    "theoretical models suggest phase - space is conserved during the hierarchical collapse of structures , implying that the densest parts of the structure at high redshift will correspond to the densest regions in its descendant in the local universe .",
    "these regions are populated by some of the oldest and most massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  smith et al .",
    "2012 ) , and if the ultraluminous activity we see at high redshift is similarly associated with the densest parts of the structures , this would be an indication that we are seeing the formation phase of the oldest elliptical galaxies within these systems .",
    "as figure  7 illustrates , in this @xmath01.6 structure we actually see that the most active , ultraluminous star - forming galaxies inhabit lower - density environments , while a population of apparently passive galaxies has already been built up in the highest - density regions . but are these galaxies passive because they have exhausted their gas reservoirs or has this gas been removed by environmental processes operating in these high - density regions ?",
    "the comparison with the font et al .",
    "model in figure  7 is informative in this regard .",
    "their model supplements the standard hierarchical suppression of star formation in satellite galaxies in high - density regions ( as they are no longer the central galaxy of a halo of cooling gas ) with additional stripping of extended gas reservoirs in their halos ( termed `` strangulation '' ) , but this is clearly not sufficient to suppress the predicted activity in these regions .",
    "this failure is evident in both the lack of any variation in mean star - formation rate with environment in figure  7 and through the relative absence of luminous , red galaxies in the model predictions shown in figure  3 .",
    "we therefore suggest that the lack of activity in the passive population we observe in the highest - density regions of cl0218.3@xmath10510 is because these galaxies have exhausted their gas reservoirs , rather than because the gas has been removed via an externally - driven environmental process .",
    "other processes are thus needed to suppress the star formation in these galaxies , for example feedback from agn , as suggested for the passive red galaxy population in a @xmath01.46 cluster by hayashi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which could aid in the removal of their gas reservoirs .",
    "overall we propose that we are not seeing the initial phase of formation of cluster ellipticals in cl0218.3@xmath10510 , which must instead have occured at an earlier epoch , as suggested by studies of @xmath1072 proto - clusters ( e.g.  geach et al .",
    "2005 ; chapman et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "while the theoretical galaxy evolution models may not reproduce the details of the galaxy populations in this high - redshift cluster , we can still use the millennium simulation to indicate the likely present - day descendant of this @xmath01.62 structure and so link our observations to local populations .",
    "we search the simulation for @xmath00 halos which had masses of @xmath108m@xmath4 at @xmath01.6 and derive a mean mass of these of @xmath109m@xmath4 , where the error is the 1-@xmath28 scatter .",
    "this indicates that the cluster mass will grow by a factor of @xmath306@xmath18 on average between @xmath01.6 and the present - day .",
    "so , can we empirically relate the galaxy populations we see at @xmath01.6 to those of similarly , massive clusters today ?",
    "we begin by investigating the relationship between the far - infrared / submm sources and the other cluster populations , we show in figure  8 the 4.5-@xmath17 m magnitude distributions for the different populations within a 4-mpc diameter region centered on cl0218.3@xmath10510 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "as expected from figure  3 , the far - infrared / submm detected sources are brighter in the restframe @xmath39-band ( median @xmath39-band absolute magnitude of @xmath11023.6@xmath320.6 ) than the narrow - band [ oii ] emitters or the photometric - redshift sample ( median @xmath39-band absolute magnitudes of @xmath11021.6@xmath321.1 and @xmath11021.2@xmath321.2 respectively ) .",
    "we also compare these distributions to the passive cluster population in the @xmath01.6 structure , selected using the @xmath111 m color criteria for passive galaxies from papovich et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which have @xmath11022.9@xmath320.3 .",
    "interestingly , these passive galaxies have comparable restframe @xmath39-band luminosities to the far - infrared / submm population . however , the latter galaxies  which are currently in a very active phase  are expected to fade more than those galaxies which are already passive at @xmath01.6 and so will correspond to intrinsically lower - luminosity galaxies at the present day , assuming that neither population undergoes a subsequent phase of significant star formation or merging .    to illustrate the possible subsequent evolution of these populations",
    ", we also show in figure  8 a qualitative prediction for the relative absolute @xmath39-band magnitude distributions for the descendants of the spire / scuba-2 and passive cluster members at @xmath50 .",
    "the fading of the far - infrared / submm sources is expected to be @xmath112 assuming that they are seen half way through a 100myr burst at @xmath01.6 ( this is the canonical duration of smgs , e.g.  hickox et al .",
    "in contrast the passive population at @xmath01.6 will fade by only @xmath1131.4 , adopting a formation epoch of @xmath52.5 consistent with the bulk of the field smg population ( simpson et al .",
    "figure  8 compares these two faded populations to the observed absolute @xmath39-band magnitude distribution of a volume - limited survey of local elliptical galaxies with morphological classifications from poggianti et al .",
    "we see that the effects of the differential fading of the ulirgs and passive populations since @xmath01.6 means that the passive galaxies are a good match for the luminosities of the brightest @xmath1150 per cent of elliptical galaxies at @xmath50 , while the ulirg population from cl0218.3@xmath10510 has faded further and these galaxies now match the fainter half of the distribution of ellipticals seen locally .",
    "given the different spatial distributions of these two populations within cl0218.3@xmath10510 , we would also expect this difference in formation age to remain , with the more luminous ellipticals in the cores of massive clusters today being older than the somewhat less luminous systems further out ( e.g.  smith et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "@xmath114 we combined scuba-2 submm and _ herschel _ far - infrared imaging of a @xmath110.25deg.@xmath45 area containing the @xmath01.62 cluster cl0218.3@xmath10510 .",
    "we use these data , in conjunction with _ spitzer _ mid - infrared and vla radio observations and photometric and spectroscopic redshifts , to identify far - infrared / submm bright galaxies which are probable members of the structure around this high - redshift cluster .",
    "we show that alma cycle 1 observations of one of the proposed identifications confirms the submm emission arises from a mips / radio source with a photometric redshift of @xmath801.67 .",

    "we find that the latter two samples of lower - luminosity sources , @xmath11610@xmath117l@xmath118 , lie on the local @xmath90@xmath84 relation , but that the far - infrared / submm - detected sources , with @xmath11910@xmath120l@xmath118 , are some @xmath975.3@xmath321.6k cooler on average than comparable luminosity galaxies at @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath114 by integrating the total star - formation rate in all galaxy populations with bolometric luminosities @xmath810@xmath9l@xmath4 , we derive a total mass - normalised star - formation rate of 800@xmath32500yr@xmath23 ( in units of 10@xmath100m@xmath101 ) within the central 2-mpc .",
    "this mass - normalised sfr is an order of magnitude higher than seen in typical @xmath70.51 clusters and indicates a continued increase in the star formation activity in clusters out to the earliest epochs probed .",
    "@xmath114 comparing the spatial distribution of the far - infrared / submm bright members with less active galaxy populations in the structure , we find that the most active galaxies are not found in the densest regions , which are instead traced by luminous galaxies with colors compatible with passive stellar populations at @xmath71.6 .",
    "this is consistent with a scenario where the activity we observe relates to infall of galaxies onto a pre - existing cluster core , which already contains a population of passive , but luminous galaxies .",
    "we show that a toy model for the subsequent evolution of the passive and active populations in cl0218.3@xmath10510 matches the @xmath39-band luminosity distribution of elliptical galaxies at the present - day , with the most active galaxies at @xmath01.6 corresponding to the formation phase of some of the fainter elliptical galaxies seen at @xmath70 .",
