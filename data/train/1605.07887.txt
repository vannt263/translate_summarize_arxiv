    "are mandatory .",
    "according to lattice calculations of quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd )  @xcite , the phase transition from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom ( at vanishing baryon chemical potential @xmath11=0 ) is a crossover .",
    "this phase transition is expected to turn into a first order transition at a critical point @xmath13 in the phase diagram with increasing baryon chemical potential @xmath11 .",
    "since this critical point can not be determined theoretically in a reliable way the beam energy scan ( bes ) program performed at the rhic by the star collaboration aims to find the critical point and the phase boundary by gradually decreasing the collision energy  @xcite .",
    "since the hot and dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions appears only for a couple of fm / c , it is a big challenge for experiments to investigate its properties .",
    "the heavy flavor mesons are considered to be promising probes in this search since the production of heavy flavor requires a large energy - momentum transfer .",
    "thus it takes place early in the heavy - ion collisions , and - due to the large energy - momentum transfer - should be described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",

    "the ratio of the measured number of heavy flavors in heavy - ion collisions to the expected number in the absence of nuclear or partonic matter , which is the definition of @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "section vii ) , is suppressed at high transverse momentum , and the elliptic flow of heavy flavor is generated by the interactions in noncentral heavy - ion collisions .",
    "although it had been expected that the @xmath6 of heavy flavor is less suppressed and its elliptic flow is smaller as compared to the corresponding quantities for light hadrons , the experimental data show that the suppression of heavy - flavor hadrons at high transverse momentum and its elliptic flow @xmath7 are comparable to those of light hadrons  @xcite . this is a puzzle for heavy - flavor production and dynamics in relativistic heavy - ion collisions as pointed out by many groups  @xcite . for recent reviews we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the heavy - flavor interactions are closely related to the dynamics of the partonic or hadronic degrees - of - freedom due to their mutual interactions , a proper description of the relativistic heavy - ion collisions and their bulk dynamics is necessary . in this study",
    "we employ the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) approach , which differs from the conventional boltzmann - type models in the aspect  @xcite that the degrees - of - freedom for the qgp phase are off - shell massive strongly - interacting quasi - particles that generate their own mean - field potential .",
    "the masses of the dynamical quarks and gluons in the qgp are distributed according to spectral functions whose pole positions and widths , respectively , are defined by the real and imaginary parts of their self - energies @xcite .",
    "the partonic propagators and self - energies , furthermore , are defined in the dynamical quasiparticle model ( dqpm ) in which the strong coupling and the self - energies are fitted to lattice qcd results .",
    "we recall that the phsd approach has successfully described numerous experimental data in relativistic heavy - ion collisions from the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) to lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the charm production and propagation has been explicitly implemented in the phsd and detailed studies on the charm dynamics and hadronization / fragmention have been performed at top rhic and lhc energies in comparison to the available data  @xcite . in the phsd approach the initial charm and anticharm quarks are produced by using the pythia event generator  @xcite which is tuned to the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of charm and anticharm quarks from the fixed - order next - to - leading logarithm ( fonll ) calculations  @xcite . the produced charm and anticharm quarks interact in the qgp with off - shell partons and are hadronized into @xmath0mesons close to the critical energy density for the crossover transition either through fragmentation or coalescence .",
    "we stress that the coalescence is a genuine feature of heavy - ion collisions and does not show up in p+p interactions .",
    "the hadronized @xmath0mesons then interact with light hadrons in the hadronic phase until freeze out and final semileptonic decay .",
    "we have found that the phsd approach , which has been applied for charm production in au+au collisions at @xmath2200 gev  @xcite and in pb+pb collisions at @xmath82.76 tev  @xcite , describes the @xmath6 as well as the @xmath7 of @xmath0mesons in reasonable agreement with the experimental data from the star collaboration  @xcite and from the alice collaboration  @xcite when including the initial shadowing effect in the latter case .    in this work",
    "we , furthermore , extend the phsd approach to bottom production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . as in case of charm ,",
    "the initial bottom pair is produced by using the pythia event generator , and the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions are adjusted to those from the fonll calculations .",
    "also the scattering cross sections of bottom quarks with off - shell partons are calculated in the dqpm on the same basis as the @xmath14quarks .",

    "in contrast to normal elastic scattering , off - shell partons may change their mass after the elastic scattering according to the local temperature @xmath12 in the cell ( or local space - time volume ) where the scattering happens .",
    "this automatically updates the parton masses as the hot and dense matter expands , i.e. the local temperature decreases with time .",
    "the same holds true for the reaction chain from gluon decay to quark+antiquark ( @xmath83 ) and the inverse reaction ( @xmath84 ) following detailed balance .    due to the finite spectral width of the partonic degrees - of - freedom , the parton spectral function has time - like as well as space - like parts .",
    "the time - like partons propagate in space - time within the light - cone while the space - like components are attributed to a scalar potential energy density  @xcite .",
    "the gradient of the potential energy density with respect to the scalar density generates a repulsive force in relativistic heavy - ion collisions and plays an essential role in reproducing experimental flow data and transverse momentum spectra ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review )",
    ".    however , the spectral function of a heavy quark or heavy antiquark can not be fitted from lattice qcd data on thermodynamical properties because the contribution from a heavy quark or heavy antiquark to the lattice entropy is small .",
    "our recent study shows that the scattering cross sections of heavy quark moderately depend on the spectral function of heavy quark , and the repulsive force for charm quarks  as originating from the scalar potential energy density  is disfavored by experimental data @xcite .",
    "this is expected since the width of the spectral function for a charm quark is very small compared to the pole mass such that space - like contributions to the ( potential ) energy density are practically vanishing .",
    "therefore , we assume in this study that the heavy quark has a constant ( on - shell ) mass : the charm quark mass is taken to be 1.5 gev and the bottom quark mass as 4.8 gev , but the light quarks / antiquarks as well as gluons are treated fully off - shell .",
    "the heavy quarks and antiquarks produced in early hard collisions - as described above - interact with the dressed lighter off - shell partons in the qgp .",
    "the cross sections for the heavy - quark scattering with massive off - shell partons have been calculated by considering explicitly the mass spectra of the final state particles in refs .",

    "[ corrxy ] . since it is a reflection of the transverse position , the initial azimuthal angular correlation in momentum space does not change .",
    "however , we find that the distribution of azimuthal angles between the final @xmath107 and @xmath193 mesons from the same pair is completely opposite to that without the reflection , which are shown , respectively , in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ corr ] and [ corrxy ] .",
    "if the charm and anticharm quarks from one pair can move a considerable distance and be separated far enough from each other before the transverse flow is developed , the results with and without the reflection should be similar .",
    "but the results in fig .  [ corrxy ] indicate that the interaction of charm and anticharm quarks with the medium is strong and they get stuck in the nuclear matter and flow together .",
    "accordingly , the results in the upper panel of fig .  [ corr ]  indicating that the charm and anticharm quarks from one pair exhibit similar flows depending on position  are naturally explained due to common collective flow .",
    "we have studied single electron production through the semileptonic decay of heavy mesons in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at @xmath2200 , 62.4 , and 19.2 gev within the phsd transport approach .",
    "the ratio of the initial scattering cross section for bottom production to that for charm production at these collision energies is less than 1 % .",
    "however , since the @xmath18 spectrum of bottom quarks is harder than that of charm quarks and the single electrons from @xmath1meson decay is much more energetic than that from @xmath0meson decay , it is essential to take @xmath1meson production into account in order to study the single electron production , especially at high @xmath18 .",
    "the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) approach has been employed since it successfully describes @xmath0meson production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have extended the phsd to @xmath1meson production and compared single electron production from heavy - meson decays with the experimental data from the phenix collaboration , because there are no experimental data exclusively for @xmath1mesons at the rhic energies .    in analogy to the charm quark pairs , the bottom pairs are produced by using the pythia event generator which is tuned to reproduce the @xmath18 spectrum and rapidity distribution of bottom quark pairs from the fonll calculations .",
    "the ( anti)shadowing effect , which is the modification of the nucleon parton distributions in a nucleus , is implemented by means of the eps09 package .",
    "we have found that the ( anti)shadowing effect is not so strong at rhic energies as compared to lhc energies @xcite .",
    "the charm and bottom partons - produced by the initial hard nucleon - nucleon scattering - interact with the massive quarks and gluons in the qgp by using the scattering cross sections calculated in the dynamical quasi - particle model ( dqpm ) which reproduces heavy - quark diffusion coefficients from lattice qcd calculations at temperatures above the deconfinement transition . when approaching the critical energy density for the phase transition from above , the charm and bottom ( anti)quarks are hadronized into @xmath0 and @xmath1mesons through the coalescence with light ( anti)quarks .",
    "those heavy quarks , which fail in coalescence until the local energy density is below 0.4 @xmath111 , hadronize by fragmentation as in p+p collisions . the hadronized @xmath0 and @xmath1mesons then interact with light hadrons in the hadronic phase with cross sections that have been calculated in an effective lagrangian approach with heavy - quark spin symmetry .",
    "finally , after freeze - out of the @xmath0 and @xmath1mesons they produce single electrons through semileptonic decays with the branching ratios given by the particle data group ( pdg ) .",
    "we have found that the coalescence probability for bottom quarks is still large at high @xmath18 compared to charm quarks , and the @xmath6 of @xmath1mesons is larger than that of @xmath0mesons at the same ( high ) @xmath18 .",
    "however , this can dominantly be attributed to the much larger mass of the bottom quark .",
    "if the coalescence probability and the @xmath6 are expressed as a function of the transverse velocity of the heavy quark , both charm and bottom coalescence become similar since both are comoving with the neighbouring light antiquarks .",
    "furthermore , we found that the phsd approach can roughly reproduce the experimental data on single electron production in au+au collisions at @xmath2200 and the elliptic flow of electrons at @xmath262.4 gev from the phenix collaboration .",
    "however , the @xmath6 at @xmath262.4 gev is clearly underestimated which presently remains as an open puzzzle .",
    "we have additionally made predictions for @xmath0meson and single electron production in au+au collisions at @xmath819.2 gev which can be controlled by experiment in future .",
    "finally , we have studied the medium modifications of the azimuthal angular correlation of heavy - flavor pairs in central au+au collisions at @xmath2200 gev .",
    "here it has been found that the initial azimuthal angular correlation of charm pairs is completely washed out during the evolution of the heavy - ion collision , even in case they are assumed to be initially produced back - to - back .",
    "this decoherence could be traced back to the transverse flow which drives charm pairs ( close in space ) into the same direction such that the azimuthal angular correlation is enhanced around @xmath202 . by considering",
    "that the direction of the transverse flow essentially depends on position , the charm and anticharm quarks from each pair apparently are not sufficiently separated from each other before the transverse flow is developed .",
    "this decorrelation thus can be attributed to the strong interactions of charm with the medium produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "the focussing of pairs around @xmath202 is not observed for bottom pairs at rhic energies due to their significantly higher mass which prevents the bottom quarks ( and mesons ) to change their momentum substantially in the scattering processes .",
