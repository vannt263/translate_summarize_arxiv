    "chaotic classical dynamics has quantum signatures in statistical properties of eigenvalues , wave amplitudes and state projections @xcite which can be described by random matrix theory .",
    "this has been demonstrated in many cases for bound systems .",
    "for open systems , however , such studies are rare .",
    "only recently , the statistics of the lifetimes of the metastable resonance states ( or the complex part @xmath8 of the resonance energies ) have been shown to be in agreement with the appropriate random matrix results .",
    "this has been achieved for only few physical systems , e.g.  open billiards @xcite , scattering on graphs @xcite and strongly ac driven periodic lattices @xcite which will also be studied in the present letter .",
    "open classical systems with fully chaotic intrinsic dynamics show generically an exponential decay of the survival probability @xmath9 in the long time limit , where the decay rate @xmath10 can be related to the lyapunov exponent and the fractal dimension of the chaotic repeller @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , the situation is more complicated because the number of open decay channels depends on the planck constant @xmath11 and typically increases in the limit of small @xmath11 .",
    "the one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath12 with space period @xmath13 and ac - dc driving @xmath14 ( where the time - average of @xmath15 can be chosen to be zero ) is known as the ac - dc wannier - stark system .",
    "such systems have been studied by many authors in different context ( see , e.g.  the review @xcite ) . in recent years",
    ", one could observe an increasing interest in view of the exploding studies on the dynamics of cold atomic gases or bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices , where the static field @xmath16 is generated by chirping the laser frequencies or simply by the gravitational force .",
    "note that in the scaled units used here , @xmath11 depends on the system parameters and can be expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the potential depth and @xmath19 is the recoil energy @xcite . in present experiments",
    "a ratio of @xmath20 is routinely available which yields @xmath21 not far from the value @xmath22 used in the numerical calculations below .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the dynamics in a kramers - henneberger form @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 we will study the potential @xmath25 with de - symmetrized driving @xmath26 and we choose the time @xmath27 as a solution of @xmath28 with the consequence that @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is periodic .",
    "let us first consider the classical dynamics .",
    "a stroboscopic phase space plot for the non - biased case @xmath31 , e.g.  for parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , reveals a chaotic strip with few embedded regular islands .",
    "when a weak static force @xmath16 is added , this chaotic strip survives but the invariant curves confining the chaotic strip are destroyed . a trajectory starting inside the strip will show a diffusive motion until it reaches the ( former ) boundary @xmath34 where it escapes to infinity . as a measure of the local spreading in phase space",
    "we calculate the stability ( or monodromy ) matrix @xmath35 for a trajectory started at a phase space point @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ phsp - wave ] shows the norm @xmath37 at time @xmath38 as a function of @xmath36 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and an additional static force @xmath39 , a value used also in the quantum case discussed below for resonant driving .",
    "we clearly observe the chaotic strip where the lower boundary at @xmath40 is relatively sharp whereas the upper boundary at @xmath41 is more diffusive .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that particles with large enough negative momentum escape and particles with positive momentum are reflected by the increasing linear potential and re - injected into the chaotic strip .",
    "a similar behavior is found for other values of @xmath16 used in the quantum calculations discussed in the following .",
    "the quantum dynamics is qualitatively different because of the bloch oscillation @xcite , an intrinsic periodic motion with the bloch period in the non - driven case @xmath42 . by constructing a generalized scattering - matrix for such systems ,",
    "resonance states can be defined and also easily computed @xcite , provided that the driving and the bloch frequency @xmath43 are in resonance , @xmath44 where @xmath4 and @xmath3 are coprime integers .",
    "the integer @xmath3 is equal to the dimension of the scattering matrix , i.e.  the number of open channels @xcite .",
    "this offers the unique possibility to tune the number of decay channels by varying the external system parameters",
    ".    here we will explore the quantum decay dynamics for @xmath6 as a function of the number @xmath3 of decay channels , starting from the case of resonant driving , @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 . here and in the following we use @xmath47 .",
    "the quantum wavefunction @xmath48 is plotted in fig .  [ phsp - wave ] for an initial minimum uncertainty gaussian wavepacket with momentum width @xmath49 centered at @xmath50 in the classically chaotic region .",
    "also here the chaotic strip can be easily identified : the wavefunction rapidly spreads over the strip and decays in the direction of negative momentum . inside the strip we find an irregular oscillation and outside , for @xmath51 , a decay to @xmath52 with linearly growing momentum @xmath53 .",
    "if the assumption of an irregular wavefunction inside the chaotic strip is correct , the statistics of the normalized probabilities @xmath54 at discrete values of the momentum should follow the random vector model @xcite describing in general the fluctuations of a sum of @xmath10 independent gaussian distributed variables ( @xmath55 ) for the orthogonal ( goe ) , unitary ( gue ) and symplectic ( gse ) ensemble , respectively .",

    "the decay , however , is very sensitive with respect to this ratio .",
