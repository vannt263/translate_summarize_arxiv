    "it follows then that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hubble parameter .",
    "if the disc galaxy radius is proportional to , then a significant decrease of sizes with @xmath4 at a fixed halo mass is expected ( e.g. , mo , mao , & white 1998 ; bouwens & silk 2002 ) . for haloes treated as truncated isothermal spheres and assuming that an exponential disc is formed under detailed angular momentum conservation , it indeed follows that @xmath22 ( e.g. , fall & efstathiou 1980 ; mo et al .",

    "( 1998 ) approach ( e.g. , those of somerville et al . 2008 ) actually refer to a static ( instantaneous ) population of disc galaxies at a given @xmath4 ; _ the models do not follow actually the individual and local evolution of the halo - galaxy system . _ besides , such models consider only baryonic discs and assume they have an exponential mass surface density distribution .",
    "the complex evolutionary processes of gas infall and local gas transformation into stars , with the consequent prediction of gas , stellar , and luminous disc properties , are beyond the scope of the mentioned models .",

    "these simulations use to report the so - called angular momentum catastrophe with the consequent formation of too small and compact discs ( navarro & white 1994 ) .",
    "such a problem seems to have been largely ameliorated in recent simulations of small volumes with a very high resolution and an appropriate tuning of sub - grid physics ( e.g. , abadi et al .",

    "even so , the full numerical simulations do not yet allow to predict in detail the evolution of a whole population of well resolved galaxies .    from the observational side ,",
    "the study of galaxy size evolution is hampered by the flux and surface brightness ( sb ) limits , which introduce incompleteness and selection effects in the photometric samples , particularly for those at higher redshifts .",
    "thus , the observational inferences are yet controversial ( see for recent reviews cameron & driver 2007 ; elmegreen et al .",

    "strongly , the determination of the average rest - frame surface brightnesses ( sb ) as a function of @xmath4 has been used commonly to parametrize the evolution of galaxy sizes . in this analysis",
    "is crucial the choice of the selection and completeness functions to be applied to each @xmath4 bin . in early works , an increase of the mean rest - frame @xmath30band sb of @xmath31 mag from @xmath32 to @xmath33",
    "was reported for late - type galaxies ( schade et al .",
    "1995 ; roche et al .",
    "later on , the use of stricter completeness functions , defined for the highest @xmath4 bins and imposed to the lower-@xmath4 bins , showed no detectable mean sb evolution ( simard et al . 1999 ; ravindranath et al . 2004 ) .",
    "more recently , larger galaxy samples were used , and the completeness functions were estimated independently for each @xmath4 bin by means of artificial galaxy simulations . as a result , a non - negligible sb or radius ( at a given luminosity ) evolution for luminous late - type galaxies was inferred ( e.g. , bouwens & silk 2002 ; bouwens et al . 2004 ; barden et al . 2005 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ; cameron & driver 2007 ; franx et al .",
    "some of these samples extend up to @xmath34 or even @xmath35 .",
    "however , as higher is @xmath4 , ( i ) only the most luminous and highest sb galaxies of the epoch are observed , and ( ii ) the determination of the galaxy type becomes very uncertain .",
    "it is important to have in mind that , likely , both radius and luminosity evolve .",
    "therefore , is not straightforward to decipher from the sample mean sb change with @xmath4 how is the size evolution of _ individual _ discs . besides",

    "additional kinematic information ( rotation velocities ) certainly may help on this undertaken ( see e.g. , mao , mo & white 1998 ) .",
    "given the current status of the theory and observations mentioned above , the following natural questions arise .",
    "do the direct implications of the   cosmogony on galactic disc evolution agree with the observational inferences ?",
    "could galaxy evolutionary models shed light on the connection between the individual evolution of discs and the sample properties inferred from photometric observations ?    with the aim to answer these questions , we will use here the _",
    "semi - numerical _ evolutionary approach : the assembling of haloes and the discs within them is ( i ) followed self - consistently ( for the discs we use hydrodynamic techniques and take into account realistic descriptions for the relevant astrophysical processes , e.g. , star formation , turbulence and its dissipation , stellar dynamics , gravitational instability , etc . ) , and ( ii ) for a large range of initial conditions ( avila - reese et al .",

    "alternative approaches with a similar philosophy have been developed by other authors ( e.g. , van den bosch 2000 ; naab & ostriker 2006 ; stringer & benson 2007 ; dutton & van den bosch 2008 ) . as a result of all these approaches ,",
    "the models show that discs evolve inside out , and the predicted baryonic , stellar and luminous present - day scaling relations tend to be in agreement with observations ( see e.g. , fa00 ; avila - reese et al .",

    "a brief description of the galaxy evolutionary models and the strategy followed in this paper are presented .",
    "the results regarding disc size evolution and comparison with observational inferences are given in section 3 .",

    "our models calculate the formation and evolution of disc galaxies inside growing @xmath0cdm haloes , attempting to keep the underlying physics as transparent as possible .",
    "the main physical ingredients are as follows ( see for details fa2000 ; avila - reese & firmani 2000 ) . an extended press ",

    "is applied to calculate the time  by  time virialization of the accreting mass shells ( avila - reese et al .",
    "the orbit ellipticity is fixed in such a way that the structure of the  haloes agrees well with results from cosmological n  body simulations ( avila - reese et al .",
    "1999 ; fa2000 ) .",
    "a constant ( baryon ) fraction   of the mass of each shell is assumed to cool down in a dynamical time and form a disc layer .",
    "the accreting mass shells at the time of their virialization , @xmath41 , are assumed to rotate rigidly with a specific angular momentum calculated as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 represents a difference between two time steps , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , are the halo total angular momentum , mass , and energy respectively ; @xmath47 is the halo spin parameter , assumed to be _ constant in time_. as a result of the assembling of these mass shells , a present - day halo ends with an angular momentum distribution close to the ( universal ) distribution measured in n - body simulations ( bullock et al .",
    "the radial mass distribution of the layer is calculated by equating its specific angular momentum to that of its final circular orbit in centrifugal equilibrium ( detailed angular momentum conservation ) .",
    "the superposition of these layers form a gaseous disc , which tends to be steeper in the centre and flatter at the periphery than the exponential law .",

    "a cusp is present in the inner region , where the bulge is identified in observed galaxies .",
    "the disc sf at a given radius ( assuming azimuthal symmetry ) is triggered by the toomre gas gravitational instability criterion and self  regulated by a balance between the energy input due to sne and the turbulent energy dissipation in the ism .",
    "both such ingredients determine the gas disc height and the sf rate .",
    "this physical prescription naturally yields a schmidt - kennicutt - like law .",
    "the sf efficiency depends on the gas surface density determined mainly by @xmath48 , and on the gas infall history , which is assumed to be proportional to the halo mah .",

    "a given galaxy model is defined then by the halo mah and @xmath48 , and by .",
    "the idea is _ to keep the model as simple as possible in order to explore the direct consequences of the  cosmogony on disc galaxy evolution_. since we are interested here in the generic evolutionary trends , we study only the `` central '' models of different masses characterized by :    * the averaged mah corresponding to the given halo mass , * a value of @xmath50 , which is close to the mean of relaxed haloes measured in numerical simulations ( e.g. , bett et al .",

    "several pieces of evidence suggest values of @xmath52 , though  is expected to vary with mass , being smaller for both very low and very high luminosity galaxies . some physical mechanisms suggested for producing such low values",
    "are sn - driven galaxy mass outflows , long gas cooling times in massive haloes , sn and agn halo gas re - heating . given the current uncertainties in the understanding of these processes as well as in the observational determination of the halo masses , , we have preferred here to use a constant value for  equal to 0.03 .",
    "with such a value , our disc galaxy models agree with observed dynamical properties , mainly the approximate flatness of the rotation curves at different epochs and the present - day disc - to - total velocity ratios at the maximum of the rotation curve ( see e.g. , mo et al .",
