    "the view that galaxies are surrounded by large dark matter halos dates back more than 30 years to the pioneering study of the rotation curve of m32 by rubin & ford ( 1970 ) .",
    "extended galactic halos are , in fact , a generic feature of the cold dark matter model of galaxy formation ( blumenthal et al 1984 , frenk et al 1985 ) , but this fundamental theoretical prediction has limited observational support .",
    "zaritsky  ( 1993 ) attempted to measure the mass and extent of dark matter halos by analysing the dynamics of satellite galaxies found around ` isolated ' galaxies .",
    "since galaxies generally have only a few detectable satellites , they used a method that consists of stacking satellites in a sample of primaries of similar luminosity . in spite of the small size of their relatively inhomogeneous sample , zaritsky  ( 1993 ) were able to detect massive halos around isolated spiral galaxies extending to many optical radii .",
    "having nearly doubled their satellite sample to 115 members , zaritsky ( 1997b ) confirmed their earlier claims including a puzzling lack of correlation between the velocity dispersion of the ( stacked ) satellite system and the luminosity of the primary .",
    "more recently , mckay  ( 2002 ) performed a similar analysis on data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york  2000 ) .",
    "they compared mass estimates derived from satellite dynamics to those derived from weak lensing analyses of the same data ( mckay 2001 ) . with a much larger sample than that of zaritsky et al ( 1997 )",
    ", they were able to detect a correlation between satellite velocity dispersion and primary luminosity .",
    "this trend was confirmed by prada  ( 2003 ) who also used sdss data .",
    "although they are both based on sdss data , these two studies find results that , while consistent at first sight , are in , fact , somewhat contradictory . for example , although prada et al ( 2003 ) found a strong dependence of satellite velocity dispersion on galactrocentric distance , their measured velocity dispersion within a radius of 125  is similar to the values obtained by mckay  ( 2002 ) at a radius of 275  .",
    "discrepant results were also found by brainerd & specian ( 2003 ) who applied the same technique to the early , `` 100k '' data release of the 2degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless 2001 ) and derived satellite velocity dispersions which are in qualitative and quantitative disagreement with those of zaritsky ( 1997 ) , mckay  ( 2002 ) and prada  ( 2003 ) . a more extensive analysis of the complete 2dfgrs ( colless  2003 ) by brainerd ( 2005 ) also led to disagreements with the results of earlier work .",
    "this somewhat confused picture of satellite dynamics is due in large part to different choices of primary galaxy samples and to differences in the modelling and analysis methods .",
    "this paper has multiple aims .",
    "firstly , we carry out a new analysis of the dynamics of satellites around bright galaxies of different morphological types selected from the full 2dfgrs .",
    "the goal is to constrain the velocity dispersion and mass of their dark matter halos and we therefore select a sample of isolated galaxies chosen according to strict criteria . secondly , we investigate the reliability and accuracy of commonly used dynamical analysis methods .",
    "for this , we make extensive use of realistic mock catalogues constructed from large cosmological n - body simulations and different semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( cole  2000 ; ) .",
    "a similar approach , but in a different context , was adopted by . finally , we attempt to understand the root cause of the differences found in previous work , again relying on the use of realistic mock catalogues .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] , we briefly present some of the characteristics of the 2dfgrs data and simulations used for our analysis . in section  [ sec : sample ]",
    ", we describe the satellite sample selection scheme , together with its robustness to changes in the selection parameters .",
    "the analysis of the stacked satellite velocity distribution is carried in section  [ sec : anal ] while , in section  [ sec : vel_disp_est ] , we present velocity dispersion estimates for our mock catalogues and for 2dfgrs primaries split according to luminosity and morphological type . using a model for the relationship between dark halo mass and satellite velocity dispersion , we give , in section  [ sec : mass_est ] , an estimate of the mass of the halos around 2dfgrs galaxies .",
    "in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we compare our results with those of previous studies , and we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "detailed descriptions of the construction of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and its properties are given in colless  ( 2001 ; 2003 ) . in summary",
    ", galaxies are selected down to a magnitude limit of @xmath3 from the full 2dfgrs catalogue , with @xmath4 galaxies having a `` good quality '' redshift measurement .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the two large contiguous volumes of the survey , one centred on the southern galactic pole ( sgp ) and the other close to the direction of the northern galactic pole ( ngp )",
    ".    three limitations of the 2dfgrs catalogue are relevant for this work .",
    "firstly , the 2dfgrs source catalogue , based on the apm galaxy catalogue , is not complete . by comparing the 2dfgrs with the sdss , norberg  ( 2002 ) estimated the completeness of the 2dfgrs to be @xmath5 , and ascribed the incompleteness primarily to misclassification of apm images .",
    "misclassification of close galaxy pairs will cause some true pairs to be missed from our sample of primaries .",
    "the 2dfgrs suffers from an additional form of close pair incompleteness due to ` fibre collisions ' during the spectroscopic observations .",
    "the observing strategy employed in the 2dfgrs , consisting of a set of overlapping tiles which are successively observed , was designed to minimise the number of ` fibre collisions ' , and the remaining incompleteness is very precisely quantified ( colless  2001 ) . finally , the _ rms _ accuracy of redshift measurements for a typical galaxy is 85  and tends to be slightly larger for the faintest galaxies and slightly smaller for the brighter ones ( colless  2001 ) .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the velocity dispersion at large radius , the close pair incompleteness in the catalogue does not have an important effect on our conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to model carefully both the incompleteness and the velocity errors and to include these in the construction of our mock galaxy catalogues .    finally , we make use of the ` eyeball ' morphological classification carried out by loveday  ( 1996 ) based on the apm images .",
    "this is available for 80% of the central galaxies in our sample .",
    "we prefer this classification to the more objective spectral classification of madgwick  ( 2002 ) because aperture effects are important for our sample of relatively nearby galaxies .",
    "however , we have repeated the analysis of section  [ sec : vel_disp_2df ] using subsamples defined by their spectral classification and find no difference in our results within the errors .",
    "we use mock 2dfgrs catalogues constructed from cosmological simulations in order to assess the extent to which the various limitations of the data affect our results . in particular",
    ", we use the mocks to investigate possible systematic effects arising from our method for selecting satellites , as well as from our procedure of stacking satellites together .",
    "the mock catalogues allow us also to investigate the effects of redshift space distortions and redshift measurement errors . in the simulations we , of course , know not only the redshifts of galaxies but also their distances .",
    "in what follows , we use the term `` real space '' to refer to measurements that make use of the true 3-d position and the term `` redshift space '' to refer to measurements that make use of pseudo 3-d positions , i.e. those for which the distance to the galaxy is given by the sum of the pure hubble flow distance and the peculiar velocity along the line - of - sight , in units of .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : stats_2 ]      the selection criterion proposed by prada  ( 2003 ) are more conservative than those of mckay  ( 2002 ) , as they require a factor of @xmath8  6 in luminosity between the primary and any of the surrounding galaxies .",
    "however , for the spatial isolation of the primary , prada  are much less restrictive with an outer isolation radius , @xmath9 , of 0.5  , compared to 2   for mckay  ( 2002 ) . compared to our choice ,",
    "this criterion is less restrictive , especially as we require within @xmath10  a factor of 8 in luminosity difference , and within @xmath11   the primary to be at least twice as luminous as any other galaxy .",
    "however , this is not the only difference between the two sdss satellite analyses .",
    "the biggest difference is that prada fit for the satellite velocity dispersion and interloper fraction separately in each bin of projected radius .",
    "thus they allow both the interloper fraction and velocity dispersion to vary with projected radius .    including this extra freedom in their velocity dispersion calculations",
    "gives rise , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_comp_prada ] , to a substantial difference in the velocity dispersion estimates , compared to what is found in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_comp_mckay ] , using the analysis method proposed by mckay  ( 2002 ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_comp_prada ] , we conclude that satellite velocity dispersion estimates from 2dfgrs and sdss ( using sample 2 of prada  2003 ) agree with each other and that the criterion and method used seem to be able to recover ( within its large uncertainties ) the underlying velocity dispersion , which is not the case for the method of mckay  ( 2002 ) .",
    "finally we are able , but with larger errors , to recover the velocity dispersion estimates found by prada  ( 2003 ) . only for the brightest galaxies",
    "is there any indication of a discrepancy , and this is mainly related to error estimates from prada  ( 2003 ) which for those samples are clearly much smaller than we find .",
    "regarding the statistics of the isolated satellite systems , we note that adopting the selection criterion of prada  ( 2003 ) causes the number of systems with at least 6 satellites within 250  to increase drastically .",
    "this statistic is similar to the one we used before , i.e. at least 9 satellites within 400  , to identify and remove small groups from our sample .",
    "table  [ tab : stats_2 ] compares these statistics for the 2dfgrs data for our original selection criterion , those of prada  ( 2003 ) and those of mckay ( 2002 ) .",
    "typically the prada  ( 2003 ) selection criterion results in twice as many large systems as for our standard selection criterion , independent of the value of n@xmath12 and @xmath13 used .",
    "hence the sample of primaries might not be as well isolated as one hopes .",
    "interestingly , as long as n@xmath14 , the selection criterion of mckay  are very comparable to ours as regards the number of ` large systems ' identified . nevertheless , we note that in all cases the fraction of satellite galaxies that are in these ` large systems ' is always small .      with the comparisons of the two previous subsections ,",
    "we have not been able to really quantify the difference between the proposed isolation criteria , even though our results hint towards the fact that the isolation criterion proposed by mckay is probably the least appropriate of the three considered and that the one by prada seems to identify slightly more ` large systems ' than ours .",
    "therefore , in this section , we use the mocks and address the issue of the radial dependence of the satellite velocity dispersion , which prada found clear evidence for in their data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_comp_4 ] we show a comparison between the different selection criteria used by mckay ( left panel ) , prada ( central panel ) and us ( right panel ) .",
    "the aim is to show how well each of these different selection criteria succeed in recovering the underlying satellite velocity dispersion , for which the median is given by the solid lines , and the dotted lines represent the 16@xmath15 and 84@xmath15 percentiles of the satellite velocity distribution as measured from the simulation cube . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we have chosen to present in each panel the results within two different projected radii , as in prada  ( 2003 ) : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "first of all we note that the different criteria are not all as successful in recovering the underlying satellite velocity dispersion .",
    "clearly the one proposed by mckay ( i.e. left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_comp_4 ] ) is the least successful , as it systematically gives an underestimate of the satellite velocity dispersion .",
    "this is especially true for the outer radial bin , for which the measured satellite velocity dispersion is barely within the 16@xmath15 percentile of the underlying satellite velocity dispersion distribution .",
    "moreover we note that for the mocks there are not enough faint primary systems for which this satellite criterion is satisfied , explaining why no velocity dispersion measurement is given for primaries fainter or equal to .",
    "interestingly , this is not true for the real data , for which there are still several faint primary satellite systems satisfying the isolation criterion . with larger number statistics , this could be a potential way of constraining certain galaxy formation models , an approach followed up by .",
    "the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_comp_4 ] look more similar , in the sense that they both recover , within the errors , the ` underlying ' satellite velocity dispersion , for both projected radial bins .",
    "however , three small differences can be noted .",
    "firstly , the velocity dispersion errors around bright primaries are much larger using the isolation criterion of prada  ( 2003 ) .",
    "we note that the consistency between expectation and measurement is only reached due to large non - symmetrical errors .",
    "secondly , the median satellite velocity dispersion in the outer projected radial bin is less accurately recovered with the isolation criterion of prada  ( 2003 ) .",
    "indeed , both real and redshift space measurements have a tendency to predict a much flater luminosity - velocity dispersion relation than the underlying one .",
    "thirdly , the real space measurements obtained with the isolation criterion of prada  ( 2003 ) severely underestimate the true underlying velocity dispersion , especially for the brighter primaries .",
    "finally we note that , for our mock catalogue , there is virtually no radial dependence of the satellite velocity dispersion on the choice of radial shell ( the distributions indicated by the bold and shaded lines are all in very good agreement with each other ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that of the three proposed isolation criteria , only the one proposed by prada hints at a radial dependence of the satellite velocity dispersion .",
    "the trend is definitively weak and would be insignificant if if the errors happen to be underestimated , or even just assumed to be symmetrical .",
    "the fact that this can happen is a potential worry for the claim made by prada  ( 2003 ) for a radial dependence of the satellite velocity dispersion .",
    "we now have to address the question of whether our claim , that the isolation criteria of prada and mckay are more relaxed than our standard ones , is consistent with the differences found between the estimated velocity dispersions .",
    "looking at the systematic difference between velocity dispersion measurements made with the two criteria , what we find is quite counter intuitive .",
    "one would probably expect , that relaxing the isolation criterion would result in measuring larger satellite velocity dispersions , whereas the opposite is found .",
    "this can probably related to a third difference between our nominal satellite selection criterion and the one used by prada : the length of the cylinder , within which satellite galaxies need to reside in order to be considered in the velocity dispersion estimate .",
    "using monte - carlo realizations of satellite samples drawn from a ` gaussian plus a constant ' velocity distribution , we see that if one uses exactly the same velocity criterion as in prada ( i.e. @xmath18  ) , one starts to systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of systems with intrinsic velocity dispersion larger than 180  . at the same time , one systematically overestimate the background for those systems .",
    "taking into account the velocity errors , this translates , in the case of the 2dfgrs , to systems which are best fit by a velocity dispersion of around or larger than @xmath8  210  , corresponding to all primaries slightly brighter than   ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_3magbin ] ) . on those grounds ,",
    "we motivate therefore the use of a deeper cylinder than prada in order to accurately measure the velocity dispersion of slightly larger systems .",
    "our monte - carlo approach shows that we could have adopted a limiting velocity difference of 900  for spiral primaries , whereas there is a need , for elliptical primaries , to go out to @xmath8  1200  , in order to appropriately sample the satellite velocity distribution .",
    "therefore , most of the discrepancy between our analysis and the two using sdss data reside in the different selection criteria used . from our results using the mock catalogues , from our monte - carlo simulations and from statistics of large systems discovered by the isolation criteria ,",
    "there is a hint in the direction that the relaxed isolation criteria used by mckay and prada are not as appropriate for finding dynamically isolated systems as our more stringent isolation criterion",
    ". nevertheless we have to point out that the data is not yet good enough to be able to fully discriminate between the methods chosen .",
    "finally , a closer inspection of the two sdss works shows that their findings are slightly different , something which was already pointed out in the analysis of prada  ( 2003 ) .",
    "indeed the outer radii within which the velocity dispersions are measured are very different . as prada claim a strong dependence of the satellite velocity dispersion on radius , the agreement seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_comp ] is not as good as it looks . on this last point",
    ", we would like to add , that we are not able , with our isolation criterion applied to the 2dfgrs , to detect such a signal .",
    "we know that the behaviour for ellipticals and spirals is rather different as function of luminosity , and therefore it could be legitimate to ask whether the effect seen by prada as function of projected radius could be due to a change in their sample mix as function of luminosity . indeed with our findings , for galaxies of similar brightness , ellipticals will reside in much larger haloes than spirals . hence stacking galaxies together irrespective of their morphological type , as done by prada  ( 2003 ) ,",
    "could give rise to a velocity dispersion which depends on the radius within which it is measured .",
    "with our samples we are not able to reliably examine this issue , as it requires the samples to be split by morphological type , luminosity and projected radius .",
    "the only conclusion we can draw from our samples is that we observe a trend indicating that satellite velocity dispersion measurements of galaxies residing in the range @xmath19@xmath20 do not contain much information .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the fact that the measured satellite velocity dispersions within 375   are identical , to within the errors , to those measured within 175  .",
    "regarding a comparison with the measurements of brainerd & specian ( 2003 ) , for which in fig .  [",
    "fig : sigma_comp ] ellipticals and spirals are shown by dashed - connected filled and open pentagons respectively , we first need to point out that they have used a similar selection criterion to the one proposed in prada  ( 2003 ) . for that reason ,",
    "we expect , as explained above , to find differences between their results and our standard ones .",
    "however , like we did for prada  et al . , we should be able to recover their results by assuming the same selection criterion .    for their sample of satellites around spiral primaries ,",
    "it is impossible to recover their results for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , they have forgotten to subtract the _",
    "rms _ velocity measurement errors in quadrature , which in their case are of the same order of magnitude as ours , i.e. @xmath8  110  ( as they use data from the 2dfgrs 100k release ) .",
    "secondly , in some way , the isolation criterion they have applied have to be wrong , as it is impossible to understand how they initially find an isolated system with more than 605 satellites .",
    "this is even larger than the largest galaxy cluster found in the complete 2dfgrs by eke  ( 2004 ) . in all likelihood",
    "they must have forgotten to deal with effects due to 2dfgrs 100k window function , which is extremely patchy , and hence very unsuitable for this type of study .",
    "similarly , they have probably not used the full photometric input catalogue to reject systems which were not fully observed . for these reasons ,",
    "their velocity dispersion measurements around spiral galaxies , from data which is a subsample of what we used in this analysis , are strongly erroneous .    regarding their subsamples of elliptical primaries",
    ", there is no reason not to believe that they are affected by the same problems as their sample of spiral galaxies .",
    "however , due to the fact that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of those systems is much larger , forgetting to subtract in quadrature the velocity errors does not influence the results by more than 10 to 15% systematically . on the other hand ,",
    "we believe , due to their problems with the isolation criterion , that the errors they quote on the satellite velocity dispersion around elliptical primaries is probably underestimated , and that the very strong trend with luminosity is too large .",
    "finally , we note that we have not , at all , been able to reproduce their results using either the full 2dfgrs sample nor the 2dfgrs 100k release sample .",
    "we suspect therefore some of the above mentioned problems to be the cause of these difference .",
    "recently , brainerd ( 2005 ) made a new satellite analysis using the full 2dfgrs survey .",
    "like for the brainerd & specian ( 2003 ) work , we are unable to reproduce in detail their findings , especially for faint primaries .",
    "finally , the results from , shown by dot - connected filled triangles in fig .  [",
    "fig : sigma_comp ] , clearly show that , with an isolation criterion that is too relaxed , the proposed method no longer finds a majority of dynamically isolated systems . hence their criteria , as already discussed in their paper , were not intended and should not used for selecting systems for dynamical studies .",
    "we note that the analytic method presented in  for the luminosity - velocity dispersion relation , derived for their conditional luminosity function model , is in very good agreement with our measurements of that same relation from our semi - analytic mocks .",
    "moreover , applying our isolation criteria to  conditional luminosity function mocks , we recover the underlying luminosity - velocity dispersion relation to great accuracy .",
    "this is a very strong consistency test for two completely different sets of models , constructed and constrained by different mechanisms ."
