    "strange quark matter ( sqm ) is a hypothetical strongly interacting matter composed of roughly equal numbers of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 quarks and a small amount of electrons  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that sqm is the true ground state of quantum chromodynamics , where absolutely stable sqm objects with the baryon number @xmath8 ranging from that of ordinary nuclei to neutron stars ( @xmath9 ) are expected  @xcite .",
    "the sqm has a little larger density than the saturation density of ordinary nuclear matter , which may be created in various situations , e.g. , the hadronization process of the early universe  @xcite , collision of binary compact stars  @xcite , type   supernovae driven by deconfinement phase transition  @xcite , and even heavy ion collisions on earth  @xcite .",
    "the sqm objects are considered as the cold dark matter candidates and may be presented in the cosmic radiation reaching earth .",
    "light sqm objects ( @xmath10 ) are usually called strangelets  @xcite , while in this work we focus on heavier ones ( @xmath11 gev ) known as nuclearites @xcite .",
    "based on their special properties , the nuclearite searches have been performed by identifying the seismic activities with an epilinear source on earth @xcite and moon  @xcite , the ionization tracks in ancient mica @xcite and cr39 nuclear track detectors in the macro  @xcite , slim @xcite , and ohya @xcite experiments , the bar excitations induced by the thermo - acoustic effect in resonant bar detectors  @xcite , the rutherford backscattering of very heavy nuclei  @xcite , the signatures of gravitational lensing caused by massive nuclearites  @xcite , and the photons emitted when a nuclearite moves through water in the antares  @xcite experiment and atmosphere in the future jem - euso  @xcite experiment , etc . despite the non - observation of nuclearites , these experiments are able to constrain the upper limits on the flux of cosmic nuclearites .    the liquid scintillator ( ls ) as the detection medium in the past neutrino experiments has achieved great successes @xcite .",
    "now the next generation large ls detectors juno @xcite and lena @xcite are constructing in china and proposed in europe , respectively .",
    "when a nuclearite passes through the ls medium , the elastic collisions between the nuclearite and ambient ls molecules will result in an over - heating track .",
    "many photons from the black - body radiation of this track can be observed by the photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "therefore the future large ls detectors have the ability to search for nuclearites .",
    "a major advantage of the ls detectors is that the ls wavelength shifters can absorb the short wavelength photons and reemit the longer wavelength photons .",
    "this feature ensures that the ls detectors can collect more photons from the black - body radiation of the nuclearite track .",
    "here we shall take the juno detector as an example to explore nuclearites .",
    "the juno is a 20 kton multi - purpose underground ls detector and primarily determines the neutrino mass hierarchy by detecting reactor antineutrinos .",
    "the juno detector is deployed in a 700 meter underground laboratory and consists of a central detector , a water cherenkov detector and a muon tracker .",
    "the juno central detector holds 20 kton ls which will be in a spherical container with a radius of 17.7 m @xcite .",
    "there is 1.5 m water buff region between about 18000 20-inch pmts , 36000 3-inch pmts and the ls surface .    in this paper",
    ", we shall explore nuclearites in the juno ls detector and analyze the juno detection capability . comparing to the previous calculations ,",
    "the visible energy of nuclearite per unit track length in the juno ls region will be reestimated in terms of the ls fluorescence quantum yields , the pmt quantum efficiencies and the juno detector design .",
    "then we predict the juno sensitivities to the nuclearite flux . in sec .",
    "ii , we outline the main features of the nuclearite and give the maximal zenith angle below which nuclearites may pass through the earth rocks and reach the juno detector . in sec .",
    "iii , the light yield of nuclearites traversing the juno ls will be analyzed in detailed . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the juno sensitivity to the nuclearite flux based on some conditions . finally , some discussions and conclusions will be given in sec .",
    "the dominant energy loss mechanism for nuclearites passing through matter is elastic or quasi - elastic collisions with the ambient atoms . as with meteorites ,",
    "the nuclearite energy loss rate can be written as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is its velocity and @xmath14 is the density of the traversed medium .",
    "the effective nuclearite cross section @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where the nuclearite density is estimated to be @xmath17 @xcite and the nuclearite radius @xmath18 can be easily induced from its mass @xmath19 and density @xmath20 . when the nuclearite radius @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath15 is dominated by the nuclearite electron atmosphere which is never smaller than the typical atomic size with the radius of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dedx ] ) should be replaced by the constant retarding force @xmath24 for the subsonic velocity @xmath25 with a structural energy density @xmath26 erg @xmath27 @xcite .    based on eqs .",
    "( [ dedx ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) , the travel length of a nuclearite depends on its mass @xmath19 , velocity @xmath13 and the medium density @xmath14 .",
    "some nuclearites may pass through the earth rocks and arrive at the juno detector which has a 700 m rock overburden .",
    "for the juno detectable nuclearites , they will traverse different thickness of rocks based on their direction ( zenith angle @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition , one should consider the change of the earth matter density . in terms of the prem earth density profile @xcite",
    ", we numerically calculate the maximal zenith angle @xmath29 below which nuclearites may reach the juno detector , namely its local velocity @xmath30 at the detector level .",
    "the corresponding results have been plotted in fig .",
    "[ angle ] for @xmath31 gev and 5 typical initial velocities @xmath32 at the ground level .",
    "it is clear that nuclearites from the @xmath33 direction can reach the juno detector for @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 . for a typical galactic velocity @xmath4",
    ", all directional nuclearites can arrive at the detector when @xmath36 gev .",

    "when a nuclearite traverses the juno ls medium , the ls molecules ( @xmath40 ) along the nuclearite path will disintegrate into their constituents because of the nuclearite elastic or quasi - elastic collisions .",
    "these heated atoms will further collide with the ambient ls molecules and generate a hot plasma shock wave @xcite .",
    "the evolutions of effective temperature @xmath41 and radius @xmath42 of the expanding thermal shock wave can be written as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ls molecule mass and @xmath45 is the number of submolecular species . here",
    "@xmath46 denotes the local velocity of nuclearite at the detector level .",
    "the expanding cylindrical thermal shock wave can emit lights through the black - body radiation .",
    "the corresponding power spectrum is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the angular frequency and @xmath49 denotes the area of shock wave .",
    "then we can deduce the emitted photon numbers per unit track length @xmath50 from the expanding cylindrical shock : @xmath51 where we have used the natural system of units with @xmath52 .",

    "these emitted photons from the black - body radiation can not be entirely detected by the juno pmts since they will suffer the absorption , re - emission and rayleigh scattering processes in the juno ls @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the pmt quantum efficiency is related to the photon wavelength .",
    "therefore one can not simply use the total emitted energy @xmath53 or the total photon numbers to describe the visible energy in the ls detector .",
    "it is convenient for us to calculate the visible energy if the photon electron ( pe ) efficiency per photon @xmath55 is available for the juno detector .",
    "based on the lab , ppo and bis - msb fluorescence quantum yields @xcite , we adopt a combined pmt quantum efficiency curve shape from the hamamatsu pmt data ( 400 - 800 nm ) @xcite and a fixed @xmath56 efficiency ( 250 - 400 nm ) to calculate @xmath55 for the wavelength range @xmath57 nm as shown in fig .",
