    "a complete understanding of wave evolution requires a consistent and unified formulation of the interaction of waves moving over varying topography with non - negligible shearing . although numerical methods based on the navier - stokes equations are available , a simple lagrangian formalism that incorporates shearing seems to be lacking . in practice , one is often restricted to the assumption of gradient flow in order to approach coastal problems analytically .",
    "another alternative , clebsch variables ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , is a complete and consistent approach yet is physically unintuitive and not well suited to the study of wave phenomenon .",
    "shallow water vorticity flows have also been studied using the shallow - water equation @xcite ; described as a vortex sheet with constant vertical velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; as thin shear layers flowing along discrete trenches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and using a hamiltonian formulation proposed by @xcite for constant vorticity .",
    "however , these studies utilize a diverse variety of techniques and were targeted towards specific applications while a unifying formalism for arbitrary forcing and vorticity is still needed .",
    "the quasi - streamfunction approach ( hereafter denoted the ` @xmath0-formalism ' ) as studied here was proposed by kim et al .",
    "@xcite , and applied to surface waves by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( the stream function @xmath0 was used much earlier by @xcite , in his study of nonlinear interactions of vortex filaments ) . because the @xmath0-formalism satisfies exactly the bottom boundary condition , it appears to provide simple way to systematically describe uneven topography .",
    "although one is generally limited to the mild - slope approximation in solving the differential equations generated by the @xmath4 formalism , the method nevertheless gives one a convenient means for expanding solutions in terms of a mild - slope parameter .",
    "in addition , the formalism has the advantage of naturally allowing vertical vorticity ; a feature which seems to have been overlooked in the original formulation @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to remove the zero - vorticity restriction by incorporating a vertical vorticity .",
    "as the largest velocity components are horizontal in many oceanographic environments , vertical vorticity typically dominates over horizontal vorticity .",
    "our formalism may be used , for instance , to study the propagation of waves through sheared currents or to study vorticity production in wave scattering .",
    "we hope to transform the @xmath0-formalism into a more useful tool for the study of wave propagating over inhomogeneous topography and currents .",
    "some of the results here have been derived in @xcite .",
    "this paper presents an extension to their work .",
    "the governing equations are re - derived in their original lagrangian formulation section [ sec : governing eqs ] and then solved using an expansion in powers of the free surface displacement @xmath1 in section [ sec : homogeneous flows ] .",
    "the derivation also provides an opportunity to correct a slight abuse of the variational principle in the original formulation .",
    "the hamiltonian form of the @xmath0-formalism is derived in section [ sec : hamilton lagrange ] .",
    "we propose a lagrangian only containing measurable quantities @xmath1 and @xmath3 , consistent with zakharov s one - dimensional hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the relationship between the @xmath0-formalism and the potential flow is investigated in the appendix , where we propose an interpretation of the function @xmath0 .",
    "section [ sec : sum ] summarizes the results .",
    "throughout this study , @xmath5 denotes the time and the horizontal vectors are boldface , e.g. , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . we will prefer einstein s repeated - index summation convention ( last equality ) .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system is set on the undisturbed free surface with the vertical axis ( @xmath8 ) pointing upward .",
    "the hat denotes a unit vector in the direction of the axis .",
    "the free surface is defined by @xmath9 and the bottom by @xmath10 .",
    "the symbol @xmath11 denotes the horizontal gradient .",
    "define the quasi - streamfunction as a vector :    @xmath12    the velocity field is defined as ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the horizontal velocity vector of components @xmath15 , with @xmath7 . from the continuity of the incompressible fluid , we obtain the vertical velocity @xmath16 as : @xmath17 defining the total spatial gradient along a given surface @xmath18 as @xmath19 the total divergence of @xmath0 on the bottom @xmath20 is @xmath21 which is the standard kinematic bottom boundary condition .",
    "this equality always holds because @xmath22 by ( [ eq : u - psi ] ) .",
    "therefore the quasi - streamfunction @xmath0 unconditionally satisfies the kinematic bottom boundary condition @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can show that for potential flows the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath23 is similar to the electromagnetic duality ( appendix ) .",

    "the form can be simplified significantly . using the total derivative @xmath26 and the identity ( up to total derivatives ) @xmath27",

    "the first term represents an integral over the the free surface and the second an integral over the interior of the fluid .",
    "the least action principle @xmath37 requires that solutions minimize the action under all possible variations of the fields .",
    "in particular , we may consider variations under which the surface terms change independently from the interior terms .",
    "this implies that their variations must vanish independently .",
    "the variation of the interior term leads to the `` laplace''-like equation : @xmath38 this translates to the statement that the two horizontal components of vorticity are zero .",
    "we impose this condition as a constraint .",
    "the above equation does not fully determine the stream function , @xmath4 , which must be fixed by specifying the surface values , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the least action principle demands that we minimize under all possible configurations of @xmath4 , and , ( after imposing the constraint ) these configurations are labeled uniquely by @xmath39 and @xmath41 .",
    "now , imposing eq . , and",
    "writing    @xmath42    one finds the following simplified expression for the interior contribution to the action written entirely in terms of surface functions : @xmath43 this yields a very simple expression for the lagrangian density : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "one may think of this as a matrix problem with @xmath4 being a vector , @xmath46 being a matrix , and the integral representing a contraction of indices .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 is equivalent , by definition to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the transpose of @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath47 and @xmath48 are equal , we may add them and divide by two .",
    "for understanding the variations of lagrangian with respect to @xmath0 , it will be convenient to recast it into a symmetric form by formally introducing a new operator @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the transpose of @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath53 the parts of k that are asymmetric under the transpose operation drop out of the integral after this transform ; and t allows us to write the constraint in terms of a single linear operator .",
    "when applying the calculus of variation , all functions are varied independently at each point ( ignoring for boundary conditions restricting the variation for now ) .",
    "thus , we may consider a variation of the stream function in one unit of volume completely independently of neighboring units of volume .",
    "then we may conclude that all solutions must satisfy the interior equation without having to solve all the equations involving the surface terms . after requiring equation to hold , we still need to specify @xmath0 and @xmath54 in order to determine a solution uniquely .",
    "thus , we may think of @xmath0 and @xmath54 as labeling the full solution so that we have just traded variation over the complete set of functions with variations on a reduced set of functions which already satisfy the interior equations .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is then determined by these remaining variations .",
    "the governing equations are given by the variations of the lagrangian with respect to the variables @xmath55 @xmath2 , and @xmath0 , respectively :    @xmath56+g\\eta & = 0\\quad\\mbox{on}\\quad z=\\eta\\label{eq : eta - eq}\\\\ \\left[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{z}-(\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\psi})\\nabla\\eta+\\nabla(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\cdot\\nabla\\eta)-2\\nabla\\phi+(\\nabla\\eta\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{z})\\nabla\\eta\\right]\\cdot\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\nonumber \\\\",

    "( or , one may note that both @xmath4 and @xmath59 must be independently specified in order to determine a solution to the second order equation . )",
    "equation really is a vector equation since the two components of @xmath58 may be varied independently . after applying the variation to @xmath58 and @xmath57 ,",
    "we will obtain two vector equations .",
    "equations ( [ eq : phi - eq]-[eq : psi - eq ] ) are exact conditions evaluated at the surface that determine @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 to arbitrary degree of accuracy .",
    "no approximations have been made so far concerning the interior solutions . together with the `` laplace - like '' equation , , equations ( [ eq : phi - eq]-[eq : psi - eq ] ) form the governing equations for the @xmath0-formalism , with unknown functions : @xmath60 , @xmath25 , and @xmath61 .",
    "as will be shown later , @xmath1 and @xmath2 remain canonically - conjugated variables , which is useful for deriving a hamiltonian description of the flow",

    "the first step toward solving the dynamical equations ( [ eq : phi - eq]-[eq : eta - eq ] ) is to eliminate @xmath0 using the constraint equation .",
    "note that taking the variation of with respect to @xmath0 gives @xmath62 with the formal solution @xmath63    equation is a formal representation of complicated dynamics : @xmath64 is defined on the set of 2-dimensional vector fields @xmath65 satisfying the interior equation and the bottom boundary condition .",
    "inverting @xmath64 therefore means inverting within the image of this space of functions .",
    "it may be shown that @xmath64 is invertible on this space and provides a solution to the constraint . without further elaboration on this point (",
    "will be presented elsewhere ) , we note that important information may be gleamed from equation : 1 ) we see that each term in a perturbative expansion for @xmath0 will contain only one power of @xmath2 and an arbitrary number of @xmath1 ; and 2 ) the variation with respect to @xmath0 will produce a total derivative in an effective surface lagrangian for @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in the present work , we will not pursue the explicit construction of @xmath64 , rather , we will work directly with the equivalent equation .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that retaining only the quadratic terms of the constraint equation , the linear theory of @xcite is retrieved , where @xmath66 in the leading order , @xmath2 is equal to the velocity potential at the surface , although it seems difficult to provide a more intuitive statement .",
    "the physically meaningful variable is the surface elevation @xmath1 ; and @xmath2 is simply the variable that is canonically conjugate to that . in the full theory ,",
    "this interpretation is corrected by higher order terms .",

    "the short - hand notation @xmath71_{\\mathbf{k}}$ ] will later simplify the handling of convolution products resulting from the fourier transform of nonlinear terms . because the functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 are real",
    ", their transforms satisfy the regular symmetry conditions , e.g. , @xmath72 with the asterisk denoting the complex conjugate . in fourier space , the helmholtz - hodge decomposition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the flow in terms of @xmath4 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are longitudinal and transversal components representing the curl - free and the divergence - free motions .",
    "it may be checked that @xmath76 , and also @xmath77 , where @xmath78 are the velocity components defined through equation , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the 3-dimensional versions of the operators .",
    "both components satisfy the required fourier symmetries for real physical domain functions .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath81 and @xmath82 . substituting decomposition into the governing equation for the interior flow yields",
    "@xmath83 with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) the absolute value of the wave number . in the physical domain",
    "the first equation is simply the laplace equation for the curl - free component of the flow . for mildly sloping bottoms ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",

    "the second equation produces trivial linear solutions , suitable for describing sheared currents .",
    "explicitly , we shall take @xmath88 to be of the form : @xmath89    note that the actual velocity is obtained by taking a z derivative of the streamfunction .",
    "thus , a linear term in @xmath90 translates to a velocity that is constant in depth as required .",
    "impermeability is automatically satisfied in this formalism so long as @xmath91 , as may be seen by equation .",
    "since equations - are consistent with @xmath91 , there is no violation of the impermeability condition . here",
    ", we use an @xmath92 rather than an @xmath93 to leave open the possibility that the flow represented by @xmath90 terminates at some finite depth which is not necessarily the actual bottom .",

    "the approach for developing the @xmath137-formalism is applied to derive a new form of the lagrangian first proposed by kim et al .",
    "@xcite , based only on surface variables .",
    "this allows for separating problems related to interior approximations from the issue of expressing @xmath0 in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the governing equations that result from taking variations of the lagrangian with respect to the unknown functions are organized in terms of dynamical equations for the canonically - conjugate pair @xmath138 , a surface constraint equation that provides a connection between @xmath0 and @xmath138 , and the interior equation ( essentially a condition that cancels two horizontal components of the vorticity ) .",
    "for horizontally homogeneous flows over mild topography , the helmholtz - hodge decomposition allows for an asymptotic solution for the constraint equation , thus providing the basis for deriving a surface hamiltonian and lagrangian . expanding these in terms of @xmath1 around a stationary background ,",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0-formalism leads to a hamiltonian identical to the standard potential formalism @xcite for terms up to fourth order .",
    "furthermore , this formalism yields a new quartic lagrangian written in directly observable quantities @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the description allows wave to propagate across background flows with vertical vorticity .",
    "applications of this feature will be presented in future work .",
    "a curl - free ( zero - vorticity ) flow @xmath139 is fully determined by the potential function @xmath140 as @xmath141 or , using differential forms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as @xmath142 with @xmath137 a 0-form .",
    "for such a flow , the streamfunction @xmath0 provides an alternative description . because both @xmath0 and @xmath137 completely define the flow , they determine each other up to a total derivative . for potential flows ,",
    "this relationship is analogous to the so - called electromagnetic ( em ) duality @xcite .",
    "note that this duality exists only for potential flows , since the @xmath137 does not completely determine flows with non - zero vorticity .",
    "based on @xmath137 , the em duality defines an 3-vector @xmath143 as @xmath144 where the star denotes the hodge dual .",
    "the above relation defines the 1-form @xmath143 through its differential , hence up to a differential of a 0-form .",
    "since the differential operator @xmath145 satisfies @xmath146 , one can use the 0-form @xmath147 to shift @xmath143 by : @xmath148 ( gauge invariance ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "this allows to set the @xmath149-component @xmath150 , which we shall henceforth assume .",
    "the 1-form @xmath143 is now a 2-vector .",
    "one may easily check that a @xmath151 rotation in the @xmath152 plane produces a 2-vector @xmath0 that is precisely the streamfunction defined by .    as is the case with em duality ,",
    "a rigid constraint in one of the variables may become a soft constraint with the other . by applying the differential operator directly to eq .",
    ", one sees that    @xmath153    the right hand side is zero as a mathematical identity whereas the left hand side is zero as the result of a condition on @xmath137 .",
    "the physical meaning of both sides is that the fluid is incompressible .",
    "similarly , by applying first the hodge dual to both sides of and then the differential operator , we obtain @xmath154 this is the condition of zero vorticity and it gives the condition under which a mapping from @xmath4 into @xmath137 exists .",
    "as before , a constraint for one variable , @xmath137 , becomes a laplace equation for the dual variable , @xmath143 .    in the @xmath0-formalism ,",
    "the right hand side of the above equation is not required to hold . recall that we first use the gauge invariance to set @xmath150 .",
    "if we take the variation of the kinetic term @xmath155 in the usual definition of the action , without including the term coming from varying @xmath156 , instead of @xmath157 , we simply get @xmath158 this is , therefore , a restricted form of ` @xmath157 ' which allows for one component of vorticity . as a final note",
    "this form of em duality is non - local , meaning that @xmath137 evaluated at a point @xmath159 may not be determined from @xmath0 and its derivatives at that point alone , instead they are related through an integro - differential transformation .",
    "furthermore , this transformation generally exchanges neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , as we have already seen .",
