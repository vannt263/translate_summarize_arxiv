    "the entire wall of the rim at @xmath0 is in full sight of the star , heated by intense stellar radiation . as a result ,",
    "the rim is vertically puffed up under the hydrostatic equilibrium condition as pressure balances gravity @xcite . as shown by @xcite and @xcite , a puffed inner rim blocks starlight from reaching to the disk behind , thereby creating a shadow in the outer disk .",
    "depending on the disk properties , the outer disk may re - emerge from the shadow at a certain distance , or remain shadowed throughout .",
    "the puffed up rim and the self - shadowing effect are more prominent in herbig ae / be stars than in t tauri stars , as dust sublimation occurs closer to the less luminous and cooler t tauri stars , and the covering angle of the rim is smaller @xcite .",
    "self - shadowing by a disk rim is a key component in explaining observations of herbig ae / be stars .",
    "in particular , the difference between group i and ii objects @xcite has been interpreted as that group i disks are flared while group ii disks are flat and ( completely ) self - shadowed by a puffed up rim @xcite .",
    "also , a puffed up rim has been involved to explain the light curves of ux orionis stars @xcite , dust emission features in disks @xcite , and cooling of the surface layer in disks @xcite .",
    "the change of rim height has been proposed to account for the variability of disk infrared excess @xcite as well as the overall surface brightness of the disk in scattered light imaging @xcite . moreover ,",
    "an evolutionary sequence has been proposed by @xcite and @xcite : as the shadow cast by the rim extends further as the amount of small grains decreases due to grain growth and settling , eventually an initially flared group i object evolves into a flat self - shadowed group ii object at late stages .",
    "recently , thanks to a few high angular resolution imaging instruments that have been mounted on 8-meter class ground based mirrors in the past few years , near - infrared ( nir ) imaging of polarized scattered light from disks have found structures that may be produced by self - shadowing in disks .",
    "@xcite suggested that the two nulls seen on the ring in the @xmath2 band polarized intensity ( pi ) image of the hd 142527 system are shadows cast by an misaligned inner disk ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",

    "study the stellar radiation is the main energy source of the disk ( heating from accretion has little effect except in the umbra region right behind the rim ) , and the gravity from the central star is the sole gravitational source . note that the vertical structure of the disk ( as well as the puffed up rim ) may be affected by other mechanisms , such as the gravitational perturbation from an orbiting companion ( particularly if on an inclined orbit ) , or turbulences in the disk .",
    "the naturally puffed up rims based on the hseq condition in this study do not account for these additional mechanisms .",
    "there are two types of dust grains in the models , the `` small '' grains and the `` big '' grains .",
    "the gas - to - dust - mass ratio ( including both the small and big grains ) is assumed to be 100:1 ( therefore the total mass of the dust grains @xmath31 is @xmath32 ) .",

    "the small grains are well mixed with gas as the two are dynamically well coupled - sized grains may still have some degree of settling , depending on the strength of the turbulences in disks that stir up dust grains vertically @xcite . due to a lack of good understanding of the nature and strength of the turbulences in protoplanetary disk , settling of these sub-@xmath18-sized small grains",
    "is not considered in this work . ] .",
    "the large grains represent an advanced stage of grain growth and coagulations .",

    "they are made of amorphous carbon and astronomical silicates , and have a power - law size distribution as @xmath33 , an exponential cutoff beyond @xmath34 , and a maxim size of 1 mm .",
    "the big grains tend to settle to the disk midplane , as they usually dynamically decouple from the gas and are no longer held in the vertical direction by the gas pressure @xcite .",
    "the vertical distribution of the big grains is assumed to be a gaussian profile with a small scale height @xmath35 ( i.e. their vertical structure is parametrized and not evolved in the hseq iterations ) .",
    "therefor the big grains form a thin layer at the disk midplane .",
    "the details of the properties and spatial distribution of the big grains have little effect on the scattered light images and sed presented below , as long as they are well embedded at the disk midplane .",
    "the optical properties of both grains can be found in figure  2 in @xcite .",
    "two sets of models , series a and b , are constructed and listed in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "model base is the fiducial model , which has no big grains .",
    "series a is constructed by fixing @xmath31 while decreasing @xmath36 and increasing @xmath37 , similar to the ml series in @xcite and bl series in @xcite .",
    "this scenario ( from model base to a4 ) is to mimic an evolutionary sequence : the amount of small grains decreases with time as grain growth and coagulation gradually convert them into bigger particles that settles down at the disk mid - plane .",
    "the inner rim in base to a4 is naturally puffed up under the hseq condition ( only the small grains ) . as will be shown in the next section , while series a does gradually turn from a flared disk ( base ) into a self - shadowed disk ( a4 ) ,",
    "the boundary between the shadowed inner disk and the flared outer disk is not sharp .",
    "this is because the rim does not have a sharp edge in the vertical density distribution , and the radial optical depth of the rim only gradually decreases with height . to maximize the sharpness of the rim edge and produce features with the highest contrast possible in scattered light imaging , series b",
    "is created . in b1 to b6 , an artificial opaque rim is placed at @xmath38 to @xmath39 , with a parametrized height @xmath40 expressed in the angle subtended by half of the rim to the star ( i.e. the vertical structure of the artificial rim is fixed and not evolved under the hseq condition ) .",
    "the opaque rim is constructed by filling the region with small grains of a uniform density @xmath41 , so that the radial optical depth @xmath42 of the rim is greater than @xmath43 at wavelengths of interests , therefore completely blocks the starlight in the solid angle subtended by the rim .",
    "in other words , in the polar direction @xmath44 inside the rim , then @xmath45 outside the rim . this artificial vertically constant density structure",
    "is only designed in order to create the sharpest possible shadows .",
    "it is not meant to have a physical motivation .",
    "both the naturally puffed up rim and the parametrized artificial rim are illustrated in figure  [ fig : verticalprofiles ] .",
    "this section presents the main modeling results , first the structure of the disks ( section  [ sec : structure ] ) and then observational aspects of the models ( section  [ sec : modelobservations ] ) .",
    "the density and temperature structure for models base and b2 are shown in figure  [ fig : verticalprofiles ] in spherical coordinates , with the disk surface over - plotted , defined as where the radial optical depth @xmath42 at 0.4  @xmath18 at each polar angle @xmath7 from the stellar surface ( the stellar flux peaks aroundt 0.4  @xmath18 ) reaches 1 . in spherical coordinates a shadowed region has a flat surface ( constant @xmath7 with increasing @xmath6 ) , while a flared region has a rising surface ( increasing @xmath7 with increasing @xmath6 ) .",
    "the disk surface traces out the boundary between the hot disk atmosphere and the cool interior , as most starlight intercepted by the disk is deposited near the surface .    in the model base ,",
    "a puffed up inner rim is clearly visible in the density structure as a vertically extended structure close to @xmath0 .",
    "the rim casts a shadow behind from @xmath0 to @xmath46  au , where the surface comes out of the shadow and starts rising .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ sec : models ] , the puffed up rim has a blurry edge . as a result ,",
    "the edge of the shadow is not sharp , and the disk surface smoothly transits from flat to flared around 3  au .    in the model b2",
    ", a parametrized artificial rim is placed at @xmath0 with @xmath47 .",
    "the sharp rim edge results in a sharp turning point on the @xmath48 surface at @xmath49  au , where the surface suddenly rises . inside the shadow region ,",
    "the disk does not have a uniform structure , and can be separated into two regions .",
    "an umbra exists immediately behind the rim ( boundary indicated by the dashed line ) , within which the entire surface of the star is not visible . in the umbra ,",
    "practically the only heating sources are radiation diffusion and accretion .",
    "this region becomes sufficiently cold to collapse to the midplane . on the other hand ,",
    "the region in between the umbra and the @xmath48 surface receives additional heating from the following ways :    1 .",
    "once outside the umbra and moving towards @xmath50 , the disk receives direct radiation from a bigger and bigger polar region on the star .",
    "2 .   inward heat diffusion from @xmath50 heats up the adjacent region , smoothing out the transition and preventing a sudden jump in @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "3 .   indirect illumination and heating from the halo @xcite .",
    "in particular , closer to @xmath50 , secondary ( multiple ) scattering from the disk atmosphere in the flared region becomes more important .",
    "nir flux from the opposite side of the inner rim .",
    "the strength of additional heating sources 1 - 3 increases with radius , puffs up the disk moderately starting at @xmath522  au . eventually the @xmath48 surface comes out of the shadow at 13 au and disk stays flared outward .",
    "the @xmath48 surface for all models are plotted in figure  [ fig : surface ] . as shown in @xcite and @xcite , from base to a4",
    "the disk gradually evolves from flared to flat ( completely self - shadowed by its own puffed up rim ) , as the amount of small grains decreases .",
    "the shadowed - to - flared - disk transition occurs more and more smoothly , and @xmath50 can not be clearly defined . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface transition is sharp in the b series , as the surface suddenly turns upward at [ @xmath50,@xmath40 ] ( marked by dots in the right panel and labeled in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "the entire disk in b6 is inside the shadow so @xmath50 is not defined . ) .",
    "the transition point rises and moves outward as @xmath40 increases , and the surface always converges to model base once out of the shadow , indicating that the flared part of the disk in all models are similar .",
    "the midplane temperature of the disk @xmath51 is shown in figure  [ fig : midplanet ] for the b series .",
    "there are two bumps on the curves .",
    "the first bump occurs when the disk comes out of the umbra , and the second bump occurs at the shadow edge @xmath50 . in the umbra",
    "all models have the same @xmath51 profile ( best traced out by model b6 ) .",
    "the location of the first bump moves outward as @xmath40 increases and the umbra extends .",
    "after the first bump the shadow reduces the midplane temperature , consistent with @xcite , and models converge again to another profile in cases that the two bumps are not too close to each other ( b3 to b6 ) . finally , all models converge to the base model at @xmath54 , echoing the convergence of the @xmath48 surface in figure  [ fig : surface ] , and demonstrating the similarity of the models in the flared region .",
    "the @xmath48 surface officially comes out of the shadow at @xmath50 and starts to be directly irradiated by the bulk part of the stellar surface ( @xmath55latitude@xmath56 ) .",
    "however , the transition to the `` flared profile '' occurs much earlier than @xmath50 .",
    "for example , b4 starts to deviate from its `` shadow profile '' ( traced out by b6 ) at @xmath5210 au , and gradually converges towards its `` flared profile '' ( traced out by base ) until the eventual merger at @xmath57  au .",
    "this echoes the smooth transition in temperature and density structures seen in figure  [ fig : verticalprofiles ] .",
    "vertical density structure of the disk is determined by the temperature structure under the hseq condition .",
    "therefore , at radius of a fraction of @xmath50 , the disk already starts to deviate from its thin `` shadow state '' and become modestly puffed up , until eventually smoothly joins the flared disk at @xmath50 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : verticalprofiles ] for b2 , in which case the thin `` shadow state '' ends at @xmath522  au , and in between 2  au and @xmath49  au the disk is modestly puffed up , and beyond 13  au the disk becomes fully flared .    in summary ,",
    "the disk in series a evolves from a mostly flared disk to a self - shadowed flat disk , but the shadowed - to - flared - disk transition is smooth , due to the lack of a sharp rim edge . in the extreme cases , with parametrized sharp rims in series b , the transition on the @xmath48 surface becomes sharp , but",
    "the transition in the underlying disk density and temperature structure is still smooth and occurs over a radius range .",
    "sed for all models are shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "series a mimics the evolutionary sequence from group i to ii , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the 1 - 100 @xmath18 infrared excess drops as the total amount of small grains decreases and the disk becomes more and more self - shadowed , meanwhile the far infrared and mm emissions beyond 100  @xmath18 rise due to more big grains . for series",
    "b , the nir excess from 1 - 10  @xmath18 comes from the artificial rim , which increases as the rim grows higher from b1 to b6 .",
    "meanwhile the 10 - 100  @xmath18 excess decreases as the shadow edge expands and a bigger disk region falls into the shadow .",
    "this is similar to the `` seesaw '' phenomenon in @xcite , which has been explained by puffed up rims with varying heights . beyond 100  @xmath18",
    "the emissions mainly come from the outer part of the disk , which remains flared and has a similar density and temperature structure in most models thus the emission is little changed .    scattered light images trace structures at the disk surface , set by the dust distribution and intrinsically determined by the temperature structure under the hseq condition . while formally inside @xmath50 , the shadowed region may still receives and scatters nir photons from ( 1 ) the polar region of the star ( in the region immediately below the radial @xmath48 surface ) ; ( 2 ) the bulk part of the star ( high in the disk atmosphere ) ; ( 3 ) the opposite side of the rim ; and ( 4 ) secondary scattering photons from the disk halo ( in particular at radius close to @xmath50 ) . if the rim is naturally puffed up , stellar photons may also be scattered by the tenuous rim edge into the shadowed region",
    "therefore , it is expected that the shadowed region to be not completely dark , and the surface brightness should converge to the flared disk when getting closer to @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath2  band polarized intensity images for model b2 and b4 are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] . in b2 , a marginal ring / gap structure ( i.e. a region with pi@xmath58 ) at @xmath50 can be seen at face - on viewing angle , inside which the shadowed region has low surface brightness . if we define `` ring / gap contrast '' as the ratio of the azimuthally averaged surface brightness at the peak of the ring to the bottom of the gap , the contrast is 1.33 for the raw image and 1.03 for the convolved image . at a 45@xmath59 inclination angle ,",
    "the ring becomes elliptical , and due to the forward / backward scattering effect the front side is brighter than the back side @xcite . in b4 ,",
    "the shadow edge is not distinctive in all panels . at face - on viewing angle , the azimuthally",
    "averaged surface brightness decreases with radius throughout the disk ( see figure  [ fig : image - rp ] ) .",
    "the radial profile of face on @xmath2  band pi images for all models are shown in figure  [ fig : image - rp ] .",
    "for the a models , converting small grains into vertically settled big grains gradually turns a bright flared disk into a faint flat one .",
    "the brightness of the disk drops by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "however this process happens in a rather smooth manner that the surface brightness of the entire disk drops all together , while the outer disk drops faster than the inner region .",
    "the dependence of pi on @xmath6 changes from pi@xmath60 in the base model to pi@xmath61 in a4 .",
    "the surface brightness distribution remains smooth and relatively featureless throughout in all cases .",
    "in particular , no ring / gap structure exists at the edge of the shadowed region , in either the original images or the @xmath62 scaled images .    for the b models ,",
    "the shadowed - to - flared - disk transition is clearly visible on the radial profiles . in general",
    ", the surface brightness radial profile can be described by a 3-stage broken power law : ( 1 ) well inside the shadow different models have a similar radial profile as pi@xmath63 ( best seen in b3 to b6 as their shadows extend far enough ) ; ( 2 ) in the flared region all models converge to pi@xmath60 , the same as the base model ; and ( 3 ) a transition region with pi  @xmath64 ( constant pi ) connects the two .",
    "this is consistent with the trend seen earlier in the disk density , temperature , and surface structures , that b models have essentially the same structure both in the inner shadowed region and the outer flared region , with a wide transition region in between . and",
    "similar to the @xmath51 profile , the transition occurs over a radius range and not suddenly . for b2 to b5 in b1",
    "is too close to the star and beyond the capability of current nir imaging facilities . ] , radial profiles smoothly deviate from the @xmath65 profile around @xmath66 , and gradually converge to the @xmath60 profile around @xmath50 .",
    "b3 has a marginal `` gap / ring '' structure similar to b2 , with very weak ring / gap contrast ratios ( listed in table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "pi never increases with radius throughout the disk in b4 to b6 , and a ring / gap structure is not present around the shadow edge .",
    "the difference between b2/b3 and b4/b5 is probably caused by the fact that the transition region is wider in b4/b5 due to their large shadow size , so the transition occurs even more smoothly .",
    "the effects of puffed up inner rims in protoplanetary disks in both temperature and density structure and nir scattered light imaging are studied .",
    "two types of rims are explored : natural rims that are self - consistently puffed up under the hydrostatic equilibrium condition ( series a ) , and artificial opaque rims with parametrized heights and sharp edges in the vertical direction ( series b ) .",
    "the main results from the models are :    1 .",
    "an inner rim naturally puffed up under the hseq condition creates a shadow behind , within which the disk surface is flat and beyond which it is flared ( the a models ) . decreasing the amount of small grains gradually turn the entire disk into a self - shadowed and flat disk , confirming previous results such as in @xcite ( figure  [ fig : surface ] ) .",
    "2 .   for naturally puffed up rims ,",
    "the shadowed - to - flared - disk transition occurs smoothly , and no sharp / distinct turning point on the disk surface exists .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that hseq rims do not have a sharp vertical edge , and their `` radial optical depth '' gently decreases with height . as a result ,",
    "the scattered light images have a smooth / featureless surface brightness distribution . from base to a4 , the surface brightness of the disk drops by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude , and the radial dependence changes from a shallower @xmath67 to a steeper @xmath68 ( figure  [ fig : image - rp ] ) .",
    "3 .   the most extreme rims , which are parametrized artificial rims with a razor sharp vertical edge in the b series ,",
    "do create a sharp turning point on the radial @xmath48 surface ( figure  [ fig : surface ] ) .",
    "this point formally defines the edge of the shadow @xmath50 , beyond which the surface is flared and sees the bulk part of the star .",
    "both the inner shadowed region and the flared region are similar in models with different rim heights .",
    "on the other hand , the shadowed - to - flared - disk transition does not occur abruptly in the underlying disk density and temperature structures .",
    "the midplane temperature starts to deviate from its `` shadow profile '' at a fraction of @xmath50 ( figure  [ fig : midplanet ] ) , and eventually converges to its `` flared profile '' around @xmath50 .",
    "the density structure of the disk follows the change in @xmath51 under the hseq condition , thereby exhibits a broad transition region as well ( figure  [ fig : verticalprofiles ] ) .",
    "this is mainly caused by partial illumination by the polar region of the star , multiple scattering , and radiation diffusion within the disk .",
    "4 .   even the parametrized razor sharp rims in the b models can not produce prominent rings and arcs in scattered light images as what have been directly imaged recently . on the other hand ,",
    "self - shadowing by the rim does have a clear effect on the radial profile of the scattered light .",
    "the surface brightness radial profiles of the b models can be described by a 3-stage broken power law : two steep profiles in the inner shadowed region and the flared region , connected by a shallow profile in a broad transition region ( figure  [ fig : image - rp ] ) .",
    "the enhancement around the shadow edge however is usually not strong enough to make a prominent ring / gap structure .",
    "b2 and b3 show a very marginal ring / gap structure around @xmath50 ( figure  [ fig : images ] ) , while other models remain largely smooth and featureless throughout in both the original and @xmath62 scaled images .",
    "remarks on the implications of the models and observations :    1 .",
    "a faint disk in nir direct imaging observations with a relatively steep surface brightness radial profile ( i.e. @xmath69 ) is consistent with small grains being heavily depleted and the entire disk is self - shadowed by the inner rim .",
    "the surface brightness threshold depends on the stellar luminosity . for a @xmath43  k , 2.5 @xmath70 , and 2 @xmath71 central star ,",
    "the threshold is about 1/@xmath72 mjy arcsec@xmath73 .",
    "such kind of faint disks may have already been found in observations ( e.g. hd  139614 , subaru direct imaging , m. fukagawa , private communication , hashimoto et al . in prep . ) .",
    "2 .   even with the sharpest possible rims as the parametrized rims in b models , the shadow edge fails to manifest itself as prominent rings / arcs in scattered light images .",
    "the highest ring / gap contrast ratio in full resolution images is only 1.33 , and practically no ring / gap structure is found in convolved images with an angular resolution of 0.05@xmath74 .",
    "note that the convolved images in this study have the ideal chance to review potential disk structures , as ( 1 ) they are convolved by a gaussian psf , which smears the intrinsic full resolution images less than a realistic psf that has a similar kernel but more extended wings ; ( 2 ) no observational noises and instrument effects are included , which are expected to further weaken the detectability of features in images .",
    "3 .   realistic rims in a models can only produce structures even smoother than b models in scattered light images .",
    "radial structures with high contrast recently observed in nir direct imaging surveys , such as the arcs in the hd  163296 system @xcite , the gap in the hd  169142 system @xcite , the spiral arms in the sao  206462 system @xcite and the mwc  758 system @xcite , and various rings and arcs in transitional disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "scattered light images show a 3-stage broken power law : 2 steep radial profiles in the inner and other disk connected by a shallow transition region around the shadow edge .",
    "such systems may have already been observed : the @xmath2  band scattered light image of tw hydrae has a shallow @xmath75 transition region located at @xmath7620 - 40  au , in between 2 steep @xmath65 and @xmath77 profiles in the inner and outer disk @xcite .",
    "the shallow region may actually be a gap , which can be either confirmed or ruled out by future observations with better image quality and s / n ratio . if the shadow region is not a gap , then comparing with the b models this may suggest that the disk is self - shadowed , and the shadow edge is around @xmath78  au ( note that tw hydrae has an @xmath79  au inner hole at the center , @xcite , therefore perhaps the shadow is created by a puffed up cavity wall at @xmath80  au instead of a rim at @xmath81  au ) .",
    "however a self - consistent structure puffed by the hseq condition is unlikely to account for the observation , as the shadowed - to - flared - disk transition is too smooth .",
    "the needed puffed up structure has to have a somewhat sharp cutoff , perhaps sculpted by other mechanisms in the system .",
