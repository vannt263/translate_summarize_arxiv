    "one possibility concerns decays based on the quark - level decay @xmath10 . the first such proposal is contained in an article by gronau and london ( gl ) , and it requires the measurement of the time dependent decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite . because this idea was combined with the extraction of @xmath0 from the rates of @xmath13 , their point is sometimes overlooked ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , these decays involve the difficult task of identifying the flavor of the @xmath14 or @xmath15 mesons in the final state , which , moreover , may mix with each other @xcite .",
    "this has prompted kayser and london ( kl ) to extend the idea to the decays @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "this is the question we address here .",
    "our analysis differs from previous ones in that we are not proposing any method in particular .",
    "rather , we are interested in what one can learn about the fundamental physics , once any ( or several ) such method(s ) is ( are ) implemented .",
    "we will focus on the following three questions :    * under which conditions will we be able to learn something about the weak phase @xmath0 , if it lies within its current sm allowed value ?",
    "* how does a measurement of @xmath2 help us to constrain new physics ? * how do strong phases impact the previous questions ?",
    "we obtain qualitative answers to these questions by looking at a number of examples , but we do not try to simulate statistical analysis of prospective data , since that will depend on the precise decay and method used .    in section  [ sec : sm ]",
    "we assume the sm and analyze the accuracy with which @xmath0 can be determined in prospective scenarios . in subsection  [ subsec : current ]",
    "we define our notation and review the current status of the sm . in subsection  [ subsec :",

    "we will argue that , if the ( one sigma ) errors on @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , we are likely to learn very little . on the other hand , even a twofold improvement in those errors may allow us to make an improvement over the present constraints on @xmath0 . in those sections , we ignore the problems brought about by the strong phases .",
    "these are dealt with in subsection  [ subsec : strong ] .    section  [ sec : new ] is devoted to a study of the constraints imposed on new physics by a measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "we stress the importance of the _ complex _ matrix elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 which , in the usual phase convention , have phases @xmath25 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the determination of _ either _ of these , together with our present knowledge of the other matrix elements , completes the determination of the ckm matrix .",
    "here we emphasize the fact that the experimental determination of the ( complex ) matrix element @xmath23 depends entirely on @xmath26 mixing , which , because it occurs in the sm through a box diagram , can be subject to large new physics effects .",
    "we denote this `` mixing '' information by @xmath27 : its phase is determined from the cp - violating asymmetry already measured at belle and babar , @xmath28 , and its magnitude , @xmath29 , will be well determined once the @xmath30 mass difference @xmath31 is measured at fermilab . indeed ,",
    "although the extraction of @xmath29 from @xmath32 is plagued by large hadronic uncertainties , it is believed that those uncertainties are under much better control for the ratio @xmath33 @xcite .",

    "we draw our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "one of our main points is the following : in the short term , a measurement of @xmath2 is likely to be more useful as a probe for new physics than it will be for a better determination of the phase @xmath0 in the sm .",
    "for convenience , we introduce the following notation : @xmath39 by combining the experimental bounds on @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , ali and london obtained in early 2000 the following 95% c.l . ranges for the standard model @xcite , @xmath44 leading to @xmath45 perhaps surprisingly , given the rather different assumptions and statistics used , a later analysis by hcker , lacker , laplace and le diberder @xcite , including the then world average @xmath46 , reached very similar 95% c.l .",
    "bounds @xmath47 leading to @xmath48 since we want to illustrate what can be learned from measurements of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we are not too concerned about the precise values of these bounds which , moreover , will have been improved by the time the analysis is performed .",

    "however , @xmath53 can be in the first or in the second quadrant",
    ". therefore we must consider 2 cases in the extraction of @xmath0 :    * case a : the measurement of @xmath49 excludes values larger than @xmath54 at 95% c.l .",
    "; * case b : the measurement of @xmath49 does _ not _ exclude values larger than @xmath54 at 95% c.l .    in the first case , @xmath55 is in the second quadrant and the value of @xmath0 is obtained by @xmath56 in the second case , either @xmath55 is in the second quadrant , with @xmath0 given by eq .",
    "( [ gamma2 ] ) , or , alternatively , @xmath55 is in the first quadrant , with @xmath0 given by @xmath57    we are also interested in the observable @xmath58 which measures direct cp violation @xcite .",
    "this is part of a general class of observables of the type @xmath59 @xcite where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are cp eigenstates with cp - parities @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and , as usual , @xmath64}{a[b^0 \\rightarrow f(g)]}.\\ ] ] this is a very interesting class of observables because it exhibits direct cp violation _ without _ the need for strong phases .",
    "another observable which belongs to this class is the kaon parameter @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "based on recent simulation studies @xcite , we assume that the errors on @xmath66 and @xmath1 satisfy the relation @xmath67 . given the errors in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we expect that errors of order @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( corresponding to an integrated luminosity of around @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) might be achieved in 2004 , combining the integrated luminosities of the two b factories .",
    "we will show that , assuming such errors , the upcoming measurement of @xmath2 might be much more effective at uncovering large new physics effects , than it will be in constraining @xmath0 ( if the value of this phase happens to lie in its sm allowed range ) .",
    "we will also show that interesting constraints on a sm value for @xmath0 are possible if the errors are reduced by a factor of two , to @xmath72 , for @xmath50 , and @xmath73 , for @xmath49 .",

    "in fact , the measurement may hit the tail of the statistics .",
    "also , the limiting curves in fig .  [ figure1 ] correspond to rather conservative bounds , since they were found using the extreme values on both @xmath50 and @xmath49 . this does not , however , affect the qualitative conclusions we will draw .",

    "it is also possible that , in the presence of new physics , @xmath80 is not consistent with the constraints from eq .",

    "thus far we have assumed that a clean measurement of @xmath2 will be available .",
    "however , the presence of strong phases introduces discrete ambiguities which we will now discuss .",

    "in fact , the value of @xmath123 depends on the details of the final state scattering matrix and , thus , is difficult to predict .",
    "beneke , buchalla , neubert , and sachrajda @xcite , developing on the color transparency arguments of bjorken @xcite , have argued that the strong phases in @xmath130 decays are small . on the other hand , a recent analysis by cleo of",
    "the @xmath131 decays @xcite suggests the presence of final state interactions , with a strong phase @xmath132 at the @xmath133 c.l .",
    "this result can be understood as a large rescattering contribution and thus a sizeable strong phase for the color - suppressed decay to @xmath134 , which then shows up in the isospin analysis as a phase difference @xmath135 between the @xmath136 and the @xmath137 final states . as a result",
    "the final state @xmath138 is expected to have a non - zero strong phase , probably smaller than @xmath135 .",
    "dunietz s proposal to determine @xmath18 involves the relative strong phase between the @xmath139 and @xmath140 contributions to @xmath141 .",
    "while these are not color - suppressed , there may still be significant rescattering from excited final states , such as @xmath142 .",
    "however , since the two decay amplitudes are related ( essentially by the interchange of c and u ) the same final states are involved for both of them and , so , the _ relative _ strong phase might be expected to be smaller than either one .",
    "let us now assume that the true value of @xmath123 is very small but that we are not allowed to assume this fact in the analysis of the experiment .",
    "( indeed , one does not wish for the extraction of @xmath2 to be hampered by theoretical arguments , especially if it turns out to uncover a potential signal of new physics . )",

    "the opposite occurs with fig .",

    "unfortunately , the presence of the ambiguity in eq .",
    "( [ trouble - a1 ] ) eliminates this upper limit and the smaller values of @xmath0 are allowed .",

    "[ figure2 ] where the whole sm range is ruled out if @xmath155 . however , the exchange in eq .",
    "( [ trouble - a1 ] ) allows @xmath49 to be between @xmath156 and @xmath152 and , thus , most of the sm range is allowed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "nevertheless , since the same interchange leads to a large value for @xmath123 , which we consider very unlikely , this could be considered as a strong indication of new physics .",
    "we should also dispel two common misconceptions .",
    "it is often mentioned that one may remove the ambiguities due to @xmath123 by comparing two different final states .",
    "for example , we could compare the results in @xmath157 with those in @xmath158 , thus identifying the strong phases .",
    "however , such a statement carries the hidden assumption that _ the distinction between the two strong phases is experimentally feasible_. given the expected experimental precision and assuming that the strong phases are indeed small , this may not work in practice .",
    "one other common idea concerns the usefulness of a large final state phase in improving the sensitivity of a measurement of @xmath2 to the phase @xmath0 .",
    "recall that , as we have seen above , using the current sm ranges for @xmath25 and @xmath0 , a measurement of @xmath2 is not very sensitive to the different values for @xmath0 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that @xmath2 lies close to one for a good portion of the allowed range , where it is less sensitive to small differences in @xmath0 .",
    "one could think that , given that the measurements involve @xmath159 , a large value for @xmath123 would overcome this obstacle .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the point is that , although the sensitivities of @xmath160 and @xmath161 to the phase @xmath0 are indeed improved for large values of @xmath123 , these improvements cancel in the `` inversion procedure '' described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inversion ] ) that leads from these observables to the value of @xmath2 which we wish to know . in powers of @xmath162 and substituting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inversion ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath163 as it had to be .",
    "clearly , the term linear in @xmath162 vanishes whenever @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) . ]",
    "we conclude that , in the sm , the final - state phases can not improve the sensitivity of @xmath49 to the phase @xmath0 .",
    "contrary to what one may think , if these phases are close to zero they are actually an enormous nuisance , since in that case , and whatever the value of @xmath55 , one can not distinguish the true value of @xmath49 from the possibility that @xmath166 , thus precluding the exclusion of small values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have also shown that , if the final - state phases are large , the sensitivity of @xmath167 to the phase @xmath0 is not improved at all .",
    "nevertheless , in that case , we may be lucky in disentangling the strong phases by comparing different channels .",
    "up to now , we have assumed the sm and concentrated our attention on the capabilities of a measurement of @xmath2 to improve our information on the ckm phase @xmath0 .",
    "we now turn to the capabilities of this measurement to constrain new physics effects .",
    "it is likely that the most precise determination of the ckm parameters in the next two or three years will come from the measurements of the cp - violating assymetry in @xmath5 decays and from the measurements of @xmath33 .",
    "these determine the element @xmath27 with phase @xmath38 and magnitude @xmath168 the factor @xmath169 is 1 in the su(3 ) limit and has been calculated on the lattice to be @xmath170 @xcite , but more theoretical work is needed to get the corrections to the quenched approximation @xcite .",
