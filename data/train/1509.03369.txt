    "the surface resistance of the superconducting ( sc ) radio frequency ( rf ) cavity consists of the temperature dependent part and the temperature independent part .",

    "we theoretically study the flux trapping that occurs in the process of cooling down by focusing on the dynamics in the vicinity of the phase transition fronts .",
    "we do not consider effects of the thermal current .",
    "we show a number of trapped fluxes and thus @xmath7 are proportional to the ambient magnetic field and the inverse of the temperature gradient .",

    "the goal of this section is to evaluate a number of trapped fluxes and @xmath7 based on the model introduced in the last section .      since we are interested in the vicinity of the phase transition fronts , where @xmath27 , we work in the framework of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory .",

    "it should be noted that , even if some vortices in @xmath92 are trapped in the process of passing through the material , @xmath110 does not decrease , because vortices are supplied from the phase transition front at @xmath32 as long as the material is in the ambient magnetic field .",

    "this formula assumes that 100@xmath130 of the ambient magnetic field is trapped .",
    "@xmath131 is reduced to @xmath132 when @xmath133 .",
    "this formula can be naturally generalized to @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the ratio of a number of trapped fluxes @xmath122 to a number of total ambient fluxes , @xmath136 .",

    "put briefly , trapped fluxes have the normal cores , and the total normal conducting area increases as @xmath122 increases ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath144 as mentioned above , the factor @xmath125 comes from the thickness of the vortex state domain @xmath107 . as @xmath145 increases , @xmath107 decreases , @xmath126 and @xmath127 decreases , @xmath122 decreases , and @xmath7 decreases .",
    "it should be noted that even if we use the penetration depth instead of the coherence length as a distance that the pinning force can reach , the resultant functional form of @xmath7 is unchanged because the penetration depth has the same temperature dependence ( @xmath146 ) as the coherence length .",
    "when @xmath145 is so large that the thickness of the vortex state domain @xmath107 is smaller than @xmath104 , the present model ceases to be valid .",
