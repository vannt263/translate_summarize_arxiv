    "domain walls appear when there are more than one vacua in a scalar field potential , and it is a straightforward matter to obtain static domain wall configurations . on the other hand , with gravitational interactions ,",

    ", it can be analyzed by bps first order differential equations @xcite .",
    "these solutions are static and it was shown that a generic static and flat domain wall configuration can be analyzed in the same manner @xcite . the procedure to obtain such a solution is mathematically well - defined , but an obtained solution is not necessarily physically meaningful .",
    "in fact , the scalar field potential must be fine - tuned to avoid naked curvature singularities @xcite .",
    "this situation is quite unsatisfactory , since a scalar field potential will change its form from a supersymmetric one by possible low energy dynamics such as supersymmetry breaking and instanton corrections , even if we assume some high energy supersymmetries .",
    "the non - supersymmetric string theories also suffer from a similar pathological behavior that the background solutions have naked singularities where the dilaton field diverges @xcite .",
    "one of the possible resolutions to these singularities is to introduce time - dependences of domain walls .",
    "the use of a de - sitter expansion to turn a curvature singularity of a static soliton to a horizon has appeared in the context of global @xmath0 vortex solutions @xcite and in a codimension two non - supersymmetric soliton solution in iib string theory @xcite .",
    "this is also used in constructing background solutions of non - supersymmetric string theories @xcite . as for time - dependent domain walls ,",
    "perturbative analyses have been performed for the system of gravity and a scalar field in @xcite .",
    "the constructions of analytic de sitter thick domain wall solutions with horizons were done in @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite , the scalar field potential takes an axion - like form and its two parameters are restricted to a certain region for the analytic solutions to exist .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to find analytical solutions for the outside of this region of these parameters .",
    "it is a well known trick that , starting from a domain wall solution , analytic continuations generate domain wall solutions with flipped curvatures and cosmological solutions @xcite",

    "the normalization of the scale factor @xmath9 merely defines the unit of length scale and we have normalized it by imposing @xmath10 at the domain wall peak defined by @xmath11 , and the constant shift ambiguity of @xmath12 is fixed by imposing @xmath13 at the domain wall peak .",
    "a peculiar property of the solution is that the scale factor behaves near its vanishing point @xmath14 as [ regular ] a(y)= hy + o(y^3 ) .",
    "as discussed in our previous paper @xcite , this behavior is required for the vanishing point to be regular .",
    "the factor @xmath2 of the linear term can be also understood from the physical consistency of the geometry that the temperature associated to the rindler space - time near @xmath14 should agree with that of the de sitter domain wall space - time @xmath15 .",
    "we will show in section [ extension ] that the vanishing point is actually a horizon and that a regular extended space - time can be obtained by taking an appropriate coordinate system .",
    "the scalar field potential is determined by the second equation of , and we obtain [ potential ] v()&= & & & + ( ) , which is similar to that of an axion with an instanton correction . in this paper",

    ", the schrodinger equation has a supersymmetric form [ qqeq ] q^q = m^2 , where q=-32a .",
    "thus the eigenvalues @xmath45 is non - negative , and hence the stability under the tensor perturbations is satisfied . as for the scalar perturbation , ds^2=a^2((1+_1)_dx^dx^+(1+_2)dz^2 ) , the schrodinger equation becomes @xcite [ schscal ] ( ^ + 3 + 4 h^2 ) = m^2 , where = + .",

    "if there existed points with @xmath47 , the operator @xmath48 would become singular at these points and the above naive discussion of the positivity would be in danger . moreover , in the derivation of the schrodinger equation for the scalar perturbations in @xcite , the linear perturbation is redefined by a multiplication of a factor which is singular if @xmath47 .",
    "but , in the solution , @xmath49 is always non - zero , and the above discussion is safe .",
    "we can not find a physically meaningful analytic continuation to the parameter region ( n-2 ) v_1<n v_0 .",
    "[ noregion ] thus it is suspected that there are no regular domain wall solutions of the form of the warped metric in this parameter region . to see whether this is the case",
    ", we will use a numerical computation .    since , in this parameter region , the constant part @xmath36 of the scalar potential is larger than that of the parameter region of de sitter analytic solutions",
    ", we may assume the solution to be a de sitter domain wall rather than an anti - de sitter one .",
    "as generally discussed in our previous paper @xcite , a regular de sitter domain wall solution is sandwiched between two horizons .",
    "the initial values of the differential equations can be provided by the three values @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath18 at a certain initial location of @xmath4 .",
    "for the solution to be regular at a horizon , the scale factor must behave in the form , and therefore the freedom to choose the initial values is reduced to the only free parameter @xmath52 at the horizon .",
    "thus , to search for a regular solution , we take one of the horizons as the initial location , and integrate numerically the differential equations for each value of @xmath53 at the horizon .",
    "then the question of the existence of a regular solution is translated to whether there exists an initial value @xmath53 for which the numerical solution of the differential equations is regular between the initial horizon and the other horizon of a domain wall .",
    "this search procedure gives a numerical regular solution for each choice of @xmath54 .",
    "studying in this three - dimensional space would be too much , and in fact , we can reduce the dimension to one by rescaling the differential equations . by the rescaling of @xmath4 and @xmath50 , we can normalize the scalar potential and the hubble constant so that @xmath55 and @xmath19",
    ". thus it is enough to check the question for each choice of @xmath36 .",
    "it would be a reasonable assumption that a domain wall contains the peak of the potential energy @xmath13 .",
    "then , since the potential is @xmath56 invariant .",
    "] , it is enough for us to solve the equations in the region @xmath57 .",
    "we take an initial value @xmath58 and solve the differential equations taking the branch @xmath59 , until the solution reaches the value @xmath13 . by sweeping the initial value @xmath53",
    ", we obtain the range of @xmath60 at @xmath13 .",
    "if the obtained range of @xmath61 contains both positive and negative values , one can construct a regular solution by gluing a numerical solution with a certain value of @xmath62 to the @xmath56 image of the solution with @xmath63 .",

    "we performed the above procedure in five space - time dimensions @xmath64 . from , the maximum value for the existence of an analytic solution is @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath66 , we obtained @xmath67 for @xmath68 , respectively , and the existence of a regular solution is numerically supported . for @xmath69 , however , the plotted values of @xmath61 in fig.[noregular ] indicate that @xmath61 takes only negative values .",

    "the values of @xmath61 are plotted against @xmath53 for @xmath70 .",
    "the dots are the points where the numerical computations were performed , and the solid line is the fitting line with an assumed form @xmath71 . ]    qualitatively , in this parameter region , the constant part of the scalar field potential is so large that the expansion rate at the core is too large for a domain wall to keep its shape .",
    "similar phenomena are discussed in the context of topological inflation in @xcite . in @xcite , a perturbative analysis of the phase boundary between the existence and non - existence of domain wall solutions for the four - dimensional system of gravity and a scalar field",

    "the existence of the positive curvature of the space changes the equation of motion of @xmath2 into h=- , and @xmath79 can take both signs .",
    "considering the high energy at the big - bang of the universe , it is plausible that some fluctuations of matters and gravity generate a region with a positive spatial curvature and the bounce of the universe simply happens from a classical dynamics . in this case , even though the present model seems far from what is the real universe , it might provide a simple toy model to study the pre - big bang scenario .",
    "the inequality plays also an important role in the ds / cft correspondence .",
