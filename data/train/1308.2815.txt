    "@xcite proposed a protocol to teleport an unknown single qubit pure state from alice to bob , who share a qubit each .",
    "the two qubit state is maximally entangled pure state ( bell state ) referred to as teleportation channel or a resource .",
    "alice makes a measurement on the two qubits she has using a maximally entangled basis ( bell basis ) and communicates the result of the measurement to bob through a classical channel . then bob performs a local unitary operation on his qubit that completes the teleportation protocol .",
    "quantum teleportation of an unknown qubit state has been achieved in different experiments  @xcite .    preparing a pure maximally entangled state",
    "is often difficult . due to decoherence",
    ", pure states evolve in to mixed states .",
    "when mixed entangled states are used as resource for teleportation , the optimal teleportation fidelity is no longer unity  @xcite , but provides a measure for success of teleportation process .",
    "optimal teleportation fidelity of a mixed entangled state to be used as resource for quantum teleportation should be greater than 2/3 . werner state , which is a convex sum of maximally mixed separable state and maximally entangled pure state  @xcite has maximum optimal teleportation fidelity for a given purity , characterized by linear entropy .",
    "werner state is a maximally entangled mixed state ( mems ) .",
    "a general class of mems is defined with the property that the entanglement of the state can not be increased by a local unitary transformation  @xcite .",
    "it is a general understanding that mems serve as a better resource for quantum teleportation among mixed states .",
    "teleportation and entanglement are nonlocal quantum phenomena . while the entanglement of mixed state used as resource is necessary for teleportation , it turns out that it is not sufficient . for example , mjwk mems @xcite is entangled but can not be used as a resouce for teleportation for @xmath0 ( see eq .",

    "( [ mjwkf ] ) and fig .",

    "one would expect the strength of the resource ( measure of entanglement ) benefit teleportation . on the contrary",
    ", we have in the mems category , mjwk @xcite state which is more entangled than the werner state , but it s optimal telportation fidelity is less than that of werner state for all values of linear entropy .",
    "further , in the category of non maximally entangled mixed states ( nmems ) , we have werner derivative@xcite which violates bell chsh inequlities .",
    "et al _ constructed a state @xcite in nmems category which does not violate bell chsh inequality , but has higher fidelity compared to werner derivative for some values of linear entropy .",
    "this leads to the fact that a mixed entangled state violating bell chsh inequality is sufficient for its use as resource for teleportation , but not necessary .",
    "further , gisin @xcite obtained a bound on the fidelity of mixed entangled states which do not admit local hidden variable description .",
    "@xmath1 we call this a gisin bound and if @xmath2 , the mixed state does not admit local hidden variable description .    in the present work , we consider maximally entangled mixed states as quantum teleportation resource .",

    "we study the optimal teleportation fidelity of each of these states as a function of linear entropy and concurrence . in order to study the role of rank of mems on teleportation fidelity and concurrence , we simulate 30000 mems of each for ranks 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "optimal teleportation fidelity of mems is studied with respect to its dependence on rank , concurrence and nonlocality and these results are presented in section iv .",
    "conclusions of the work are given in section v.",
    "purity of a mixed state can be measured in terms of linear entropy .",

    "further , we use concurrence as a measure of entanglement .",
