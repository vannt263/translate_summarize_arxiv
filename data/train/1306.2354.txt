    "the history of the universe between hydrogen recombination and the end of the epoch of reionization remains mostly unobserved @xcite .",
    "luckily , this era can be probed by measuring the redshifted 21-cm emission of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the state of the art radio experiments ( e.g. , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) @xcite and the low frequency array ( lofar ) @xcite ) are designed to constrain the 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization , probing the redshift range @xmath3 ; whereas next generation experiments , such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) @xcite , will probe the epoch of primordial star formation out to @xmath4 .",
    "prior to reionization , radiation emitted by the first galaxies drove a chain of significant cosmic transitions , which are important to test observationally .",
    "in particular , the x - ray background heated the gas above the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature ; ly@xmath1 photons coupled the 21-cm spin temperature to the gas kinetic temperature through the wouthuysen - field effect @xcite , thus making the epoch of primordial star formation available for observations ; and , finally , photons in the lyman - werner ( lw ) band dissociated molecular hydrogen .",
    "the relative importance of the three radiative backgrounds is studied in this letter .",
    "the first stars are believed to form via the cooling of molecular hydrogen ( the lowest temperature coolant in the metal - free early universe ) , in halos of mass above the threshold minimum cooling mass @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , that h@xmath6 cooling leads to very inefficient star formation , in which case stars would only form via cooling of atomic hydrogen in more massive halos of @xmath7 .",
    "according to the common picture of hierarchical structure formation , in which small objects form first , all these halos are expected to be rare ( and highly clustered ) at high redshift , as they can form only in high density peaks of matter fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the rarity is even more extreme due to two effects , which are usually omitted but which we include here .",
    "first is the effect of the lw background , which destroys molecular hydrogen and increases the minimum cooling mass , thus acting as negative feedback and delaying star formation .",
    "unfortunately , modeling of this effect in simulations is rather limited at the moment .",
    "in fact , the effect of the feedback on @xmath8 has been studied only in an unrealistic setup in which the lw intensity during the entire process of gravitational collapse of a halo is fixed @xcite . since in reality the lw intensity rises exponentially fast with time @xcite ,",
    "there is some uncertainty in how to normalize to the simulation results .",
    "in @xcite we dealt with this by parameterizing the strength of the feedback and comparing the effect of totally negligible , inefficient ( `` weak '' ) and highly efficient ( `` strong '' ) lw feedbacks , as well as the case of completely saturated feedback ( i.e. , no h@xmath6 cooling , when stars are formed only via cooling of atomic hydrogen ) .    the second important process that we include is the effect of high - redshift inhomogeneous supersonic relative velocities between the baryons and the cold dark matter , denoted by @xmath9 , on primordial star formation , which only recently was noticed by @xcite .",
    "the authors of this paper showed that relative velocities were coherent on scales of several mpc and their power spectrum exhibited strong baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath9 on star formation at high redshifts can be dramatic : the coherent stream of baryons through a dark matter halo hinders accretion and redistributes the gas density within the halo . as a result",
    ", a heavier halo is needed to form a dense cloud of gas that will allow star formation @xcite .",
    "thus , in regions where @xmath9 is high @xmath8 is boosted , which delays star formation and increases galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the strong fluctuations on large scales in the number of stars , modified by the lw and @xmath9 effects @xcite , make it difficult to predict the 21-cm signal from the epoch of primordial star formation . @xcite and",
    "@xcite used a hybrid numerical method ( for a detailed discussion of the structure of our simulation see section s1 of the supplementary information of the former paper , and references within ) to show that the signal from @xmath10 exhibits strong heating fluctuations on @xmath11 mpc scales , which can be detected using present day observational technology .    in this letter",
    "we extend the work of @xcite by adding a self - consistent inhomogeneous ly@xmath1 background , which allows us to compile a more complete history of the 21-cm signal from high redshifts ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we use the hybrid methods to evolve in the same framework the large - scale distribution of stars and the three radiative backgrounds emitted by these stars ( including ly@xmath1 , lw and x - rays and neglecting the ionizing radiation which becomes important at lower redshifts ) , and to estimate the 21-cm signal from @xmath12 .",
    "we use the standard set of cosmological parameters @xcite , a star formation efficiency of @xmath13 ( with additional @xmath14 suppression at small masses @xcite ) , lw parameters as explained in detail in @xcite , and ly@xmath1 parameters as in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the x - ray luminosity is characterized by a power law with a spectral index @xmath15 and an x - ray photon efficiency of @xmath16 as in @xcite , based on observed starbursts at low redshift .",
    "in addition , we account approximately for the redistribution of the uv photons due to their scattering in the wings of the ly@xmath1 line of hydrogen @xcite and for the @xmath9-dependent suppression of the filtering mass @xcite .",
    "the global spectrum of the redshifted 21-cm signal , and in particular the deep absorption feature expected to be observed at @xmath17 mhzis a main target of some of the next generation experiments , such as the large - aperture experiment to detect the dark ages ( leda ) @xcite . the exact shape and the central frequency of this feature both depend on the details of the evolution history of the universe and in particular on the intensity and relative timing of the x - ray , lw and ly@xmath1 radiative backgrounds emitted by the first stars ( see figure  [ fig : t21 ] and table  [ tab : global ] ) .    ,",
    "for the cases of no h@xmath6 cooling ( black ) , strong ( green ) and weak ( blue ) lw feedback and pure h@xmath6 cooling without the negative feedback ( red ) .",
    "note that the red dashed line is the previously standard case for small halos.,width=326 ]    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the shape of the power spectrum ( figure  [ fig : sig2 ] right panel ) depends on the nature of the fluctuations ( either from the heating era or from the era of ly@xmath1 coupling ) and on the type of the feedback .",
    "the effect of the lw feedback and of @xmath9 on heating fluctuations ( solid lines , right panel of figure  [ fig : sig2 ] ) was discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we complete the picture by including the effect of the ly@xmath1 coupling ( dashed lines , right panel of figure  [ fig : sig2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the strength of the feedback determines whether or not the lw transition happens during the heating era or the epoch of ly@xmath1 coupling , which decides the character of the large - scale fluctuations .",
    "for instance , if the feedback is weak , it becomes relevant only at low redshifts , and affects mainly the x - ray heating , while only having a minor effect on the ly@xmath1 fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "if the feedback is strong , then the lw radiation begins early on to suppress the low - mass halos that are sensitive to the effect of @xmath9 , so the baos are substantially suppressed even during the ly@xmath1 fluctuations . in any case , though , the lw feedback changes quite gradually with redshift @xcite .    clearly , the nature of the source of the fluctuations plays a significant role in shaping the power spectrum .",
    "in particular , the power spectrum from the era of ly@xmath1 coupling is flat on scales smaller than @xmath11 mpc , which is of order the effective horizon for the ly@xmath1 photons , within which the fluctuations are expected to be suppressed . in the x - ray case ,",
    "a larger fraction of the flux is absorbed close to the source , and so the power spectrum is much steeper .",
    "we note that recently @xcite studied a model similar to our no @xmath18 , no @xmath9 case ; in this extreme case of no star formation from @xmath18 cooling , we find that adding @xmath9 still shifts the key 21-cm features by up to a few percent .    to summarize ,",
    "we have shown that the prospects for observing the complete early history of the universe via fluctuations in the 21-cm signal are very promising .",
    "future 21-cm observations are expected to constrain the formation history and properties of stars and galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the effect of fluctuations in the ly@xmath1 and x - ray backgrounds on the 21-cm power spectrum are likely to be mostly decoupled in time and can be studied separately .",
    "also , the lw feedback plays a unique role by delaying star formation and thus can be constrained independently .",
