    "the existence of persistent currents in normal mesoscopic metal rings was predicted quite a long time ago@xcite , but attracted small attention until the recent years .",
    "the situation changed drastically after the experimental discovery of persistent currents in multichannel metallic rings@xcite and in few - channel semiconductor ballistic rings.@xcite the currents measured in the disordered metallic rings@xcite were much larger than expected and the results are still not quite theoretically understood .",
    "as for quantum rings with a small number of scatterers@xcite , a naive model of free electrons gives a qualitatively satisfactory explanation of the available experimental data .",
    "this fact puts the question why the electron - electron correlations , which should play a significant role for the dynamics of low - dimensional electron systems ( quantum dots and quantum wires ) do not affect the persistent current in quantum rings . from a general point of view , a persistent current is due to coherence of mesoscopic many - body systems and could be a sensitive method of detecting non - fermi liquid behavior of electrons in quantum devices .    in a previous paper@xcite we studied the persistent current in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) ring of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "it is known ( the kane - fisher effect@xcite ) that repulsive interactions strongly suppress the tunneling in 1d electron systems . when applied to persistent currents in a quantum ring which is partially cut - off by a gate - induced potential ( or by an impurity potential )",
    "this result leads to power law suppression of the zero temperature persistent current@xcite and predicts an anomalous ( non - monotonic ) temperature dependence of the amplitude of the aharonov - bohm oscillations.@xcite we also showed that the anomalous temperature dependence arising already for a short - range ( luttinger - liquid ) interaction becomes even more pronounced for long - range coulomb forces ( wigner crystal).@xcite    the above mentioned properties are from a theoretical point of view consequences of the singular low momentum ( @xmath0 ) behavior of interacting electrons in one dimension . for a finite size system",
    "such singularities appear in the form of a power law size- and temperature dependence . for the case of a single impurity",
    "the relevant scale is the ring size @xmath1 and one gets a @xmath2 behavior of the persistent current amplitude at low temperatures ( @xmath3 is the dimensionless conductance).@xcite for a strong electron - electron interaction different impurities act non - coherently . in this case",
    "the cut - off length is diminished ( @xmath1 is replaced by the average impurity spacing @xmath4 ) and one can expect an enhancement of the tunneling amplitude through each impurity by a factor @xmath5 . nevertheless the net current in a ring will be strongly suppressed because of the incoherent contribution of single - impurity trajectories to the tunneling action @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 is the one - impurity tunneling action ) .",
    "hence for a strong electron - electron interaction the persistent current in a non - ideal ring will be much smaller than that of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the persistent current measured in real experiments@xcite is of the same order as the ( maximum ) current of non - interacting electrons @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the fermi velocity ) .",
    "this fact means that electron - electron interactions in real quantum rings may not be so strong ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "<S> the persistent current for a one - dimensional ring with two tunnel barriers is considered in the limit of weakly interacting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a small off - resonance current , there are two kinds of resonant behavior ; ( i ) a current independent of the barrier transparency ( true resonance ) and ( ii ) a current analogous to the one for a ring with only a single barrier ( `` semi''-resonance ) . for a given barrier transparency one or the other type of resonant behavior </S>",
    "<S> is realized depending on a geometric factor ( ratio of interbarrier distance to ring circumference ) and on the strength of the electron - electron interaction . </S>",
