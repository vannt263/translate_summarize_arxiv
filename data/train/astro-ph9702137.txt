    "grain alignment in molecular clouds remains a puzzle in spite of intensive experimental research in the area ( see whittet 1992 , goodman et al . 1995 , dotson 1996 , hildebrand & dragovan 1995 ) .",
    "we believe , that one reason for this is that the theory of the alignment is still not adequate ( see a recent review by roberge 1996 ) .",
    "paramagnetic alignment of thermally rotating grains discovered by davis - greenstein in 1951 is often named a candidate for explaining the alignment in molecular clouds . since",
    "then numerous studies of the alignment were performed ( e.g. jones & spitzer 1967 , purcell 1969 , purcell & spitzer 1971 ) .",
    "however the important effect of internal relaxation was described by purcell only in 1979 .",
    "he found that the angular momentum @xmath0 is aligned with the grain axis of maximal moment of inertia , @xmath1 , ( henceforth the axis of major inertia ) on a time scale much shorter than the gaseous damping time .",
    "both the recent numerical ( roberge , degraff & flaherty 1993 ) and analytical ( lazarian 1995a , further on paper  i ) studies of the alignment of thermally rotating oblate grains accounted for thermal relaxation by assuming @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be parallel .",
    "this assumption , however , is valid only when grain rotational temperature is much greater than its material temperature .",
    "the fact that for finite ratios of the said temperatures the internal alignment is not perfect was pointed out in lazarian ( 1994 ) , while the quantitative study of this effect was given in lazarian & roberge ( 1997 ) ( henceforth lr ) . the purpose of the present paper is to incorporate the effect of incomplete internal relaxation into the theory of paramagnetic alignment of oblate grains by using perturbative approach .    in section 2",
    ", we formulate the problem . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we determine the fokker - planck coefficients arising from grain - gas interactions , while magnetic coefficients and the fokker - planck equation for the barnett relaxation are reproduced in section 5 .",
    "the iterations to the measure of grain axis alignment are obtained in section 6 , and the summary of main results is presented in section 7 .",
    "starlight polarization is caused by the alignment of grain axes , while dynamical evolution is defined in terms of angular momentum .",
    "the importance of relating these two different quantities was realized by researchers very early ( see davis & greenstein 1951 , davis 1955 , jones & spitzer 1967 , purcell & spitzer 1971 ) . in the present paper we relate these quantities when @xmath0 is partially aligned with the grain axis of major inertia .    for an ensemble of spheroidal grains the measure of axis alignment in respect to magnetic field",
    "can be described by the rayleigh reduction factor ( greenberg 1968 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the angle between the axis of an oblate grain and magnetic field @xmath4 and , here and further on , angular brackets @xmath5 denote the ensemble averaging .",
    "similarly , the alignment of angular momentum in grain body axes is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the angle between the axis of major inertia and @xmath0 .",
    "the alignment of @xmath0 in respect to magnetic field is characterized by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the angle between @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "these three measures are not independent .",
    "indeed , it is obvious from spherical trigonometry ( see eq . 108 , davis & greenstein 1951 ) , that @xmath10 and we use this identity to relate @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in the zeroth order approximation the alignment in grain axes is independent of the alignment in respect to magnetic field and @xmath7 due to their dependence on the distribution of @xmath14 . ] .",
    "therefore @xmath15 and it is easy to see that ( jones & spitzer 1967 ) @xmath16    here , as in paper i , we consider only oblate grains , because there are indications that aligned grains are oblate rather than prolate ( aitken et al .",
    "1985 , lee & draine 1985 , hildebrand 1988 , hildebrand & dragovan 1995 ) .",
    "we approximate the grain mantle surface and the core - matle interface by confocal spheroids and use @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) to denote the mantle semi - axes parallel and perpendicular to the grain symmetry axis , respectively .",
    "the corresponding core semi - axes are denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then the eccentricity of the core / mantle ( @xmath22 ) is @xmath23 it may be different for different components of the grain .",
    "it was shown in jones & spitzer ( 1967 ) that alignment of @xmath0 due to paramagnetic relaxation can be described by the fokker - planck equation ( see reichl 1980 ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distribution function of angular momentum @xmath26 and @xmath27 are diffusion coefficients .",
    "the quadratic diffusion coefficients in the grain frame of reference @xmath28 were calculated in roberge et al .",
    "( 1993 ) : @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are dust and gas temperatures , respectively , and @xmath34 is the thermal velocity of gaseous atoms with mass @xmath35 and concentration @xmath36 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 are geometrical factors @xmath39^{2}g({\\rm e}_{m}))]\\ } , \\label{3.4}\\ ] ] @xmath40^{2}g({\\rm e}_{m}))\\ } , \\label{3.5}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 we can not use the expressions for @xmath42 obtained in roberge et al .",
    "( 1993 ) as those are found assuming perfect barnett alignment .",
    "instead we will derive these coefficients from @xmath43 using the approach from lifshitz & pitaevskii ( 1981 , chapter ii ) .",
    "in thermal equilibrium , the distribution of angular momentum in grain frame of reference is given by @xmath44 and is independent of grain magnetic properties .",
    "then , the terms in the fokker - plank equation ( [ d32 ] ) corresponding to the davis - greenstein relaxation , barnett relaxation and to the gaseous bombardment can be studied separately .",
    "indeed , these are independent processes and in thermodynamic equilibrium fluctuations of each of these parameters should be compensated by the corresponding dissipation . in physical terms",
    "this means that neither variations of ambient gaseous pressure , nor variations of grain magnetic properties change the equilibrium distribution ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "therefore by plugging eq .",
    "( [ 3.7 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ d32 ] ) , we obtain @xmath45 substituting @xmath46 in eqs  ( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.2 ] ) , we get is independ of grain temperature .",
    "therefore eqs  ( [ 3.9 ] ) present a general form of @xmath47 valid for any @xmath33 and @xmath48 . another way of deriving eqs  ( [ 3.9 ] ) is presented in lr .",
    "] @xmath49 where @xmath50 . in the limit of perfect barnett relaxation @xmath51 , and",
    "eqs  ( [ 3.9 ] ) reduce to the expressions for the diffusion coefficients obtained in roberge et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . introducing time - scales @xmath52",
    "it is possible to rewrite expressions ( [ 3.9 ] ) as follows @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the component of the moment of major inertia @xmath55 can be as much as two times greater than @xmath56 for extremely flat grains . at the same time",
    "@xmath57 is only slightly greater than @xmath58 .",
    "therefore for any eccentricity , @xmath59 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this corresponds to an intuitive perception that an oblate grain rotating about its axis of major inertia experiences less friction than the one rotating about a perpendicular axis .",
    "indeed , the friction torque is proportional to grain s angular velocity @xmath60 , where @xmath31 or @xmath61 depending on the axis of rotation .",
    "thus for a fixed @xmath14 the drag is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ 3.10 ] ) .    in general , due to the difference between @xmath62 and @xmath63 the vector of the dissipation angular momentum is not directed along @xmath0 .",
    "instead it lies in the plane defined by @xmath0 and axis of major inertia .",
    "if grain rotational temperature is determined by gas - grain collisions , the difference in `` parallel '' and `` perpendicular '' damping is compensated by the difference in excitation of rotation through the quadratic terms . however , for suprathermal rotation , this difference ( @xmath64 ! ) should provide alignment of @xmath0 with the axis of major inertia . for paramagnetic grains ,",
    "this mechanism is less efficient as compared with the barnett relaxation ( see section  6.2 ) , but there may be situations , where it is important . a further discussion of this interesting phenomenon will be given elsewhere .",
    "grains perform complex motion : for one thing , the grain axis of major inertia @xmath1 precesses about @xmath0 , for another thing , @xmath0 precesses about magnetic field .",
    "the period of the latter is much greater ( @xmath65 times ) than the period of the former precession , but is small compared to the gaseous damping time .",
    "therefore , following usual approach adopted in theoretical mechanics to `` fast '' tops ( see landau & lifshitz 1976 ) , we shall at first neglect ambient magnetic field and consider averaging over free precession of @xmath1 about the direction of the angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "then the averaging over larmor precession ( i.e. precession of @xmath0 about magnetic field ) will be performed .",
    "the angular momentum rapidly precesses in grain body axes and the angular velocity of such precession is of the order of grain angular velocity .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new cartesian reference system x , y , z , where @xmath66 is directed along @xmath0 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 lie in the plane normal to @xmath0 .",
    "the relative orientation of xyz and the body frame is given by eulerian angles ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for an oblate spheroid , @xmath69-axis can be taken along the lines of nodes , i.e. @xmath70 , which greatly simplifies further calculations .",
    "the increments of the angular momentum along @xmath69 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 axes are related to the increments along @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath61 axes in the following way : @xmath75    this approach can provide the `` precession avegared '' coefficients for arbitrary grains .",
    "however , to simplify the resulting formulae we account for the grain rotational symmetry and introduce the following notation for the coefficients in the body axes @xmath76 averaging over @xmath3 gives @xmath77 where @xmath31 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ 3.11 ] ) , it is possible to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ a.2 ] ) as @xmath78 which shows , that the averaged vector of the gaseous damping is directed along @xmath0 produces insignificant nutations of @xmath0 .",
    "this is in contrast to its action in the grain frame of reference , where it can contribute to the alignment of @xmath0 with the axis of major inertia . ] .",
    "as we have chosen @xmath69-axis along the lines of nodes , the angular momentum is @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are unit vectors along @xmath71 and @xmath72-axes , respectively , in the grain frame of reference .",
    "it is easy to see , that @xmath82 combining eqs  ( [ a.2.b ] ) , ( [ a.2.c ] ) and ( [ a.2.d ] ) , it is possible to introduce the effective damping time @xmath83 where @xmath84 according to fig .  2 , @xmath85 , and therefore @xmath86 .",
    "however for grains of small eccentricities and/or @xmath87 , the difference between @xmath88 and @xmath62 is small .",
    "using @xmath88 it is possible to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ a.2.b ] ) in the following way @xmath89      the `` precession averaging '' we perform here is similar to the `` larmor averaging '' used in roberge et al .",
    "the difference is that we allow for the increments of angular momentum along all axes , while only increments along @xmath72-axis were accounted for in roberge et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "due to the barnett effect , a spinning grain develops magnetic moment anti - parallel to grain angular velocity ( dolginov & mytrophanov 1976 , purcell 1979 ) .",
    "this magnetic moment interacts with the ambient magnetic field and causes grain precession on the time - scale of several years .",
    "although the larmor precession is much slower than the precession of @xmath1 about @xmath0 , it is fast compared to the rate of gaseous damping and paramagnetic alignment .",
    "therefore the `` larmor averaging '' is necessary .",
    "this averaging is very similar to the one used above .      according to eq .",
    "( [ a.2.e1 ] ) , the damping is given by a vector anti - parallel to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "the coefficients above can be used to solve the fokker - planck equation numerically similarly to what was done in roberge et al .",
    "instead we will use a perturbative approach similar to one introduced in paper i. this approach was shown to provide good accuracy when the barnett relaxation is complete and therefore we use it here . in future",
    "we plan to compare our analytical results with direct numerical simulations when these simulations become available .",
    "the diffusion coefficients above characterize gas - grain interactions .",
    "the effect of magnetic field with intensity @xmath105 on grains is imprinted through the `` magnetic '' coefficients , their simplest form in @xmath106 reference frame is ( see jones & spitzer 1967 ) @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 with @xmath110 denoting grain volume and @xmath111  s used for slow rotation ( spitzer 1978 ) . similarly @xmath112 where @xmath108 .",
    "note , that eqs  ( [ d28 ] ) and ( [ d300 ] ) reflect the fact that magnetic field does not slow down grains rotating about the field .",
    "only the component of magnetic field perpendicular to @xmath0 contributes to the davis - greenstein relaxation .",
    "the component parallel to @xmath0 contributes to the relaxation in the grain frame of reference .",
    "it is well known that asymptotic results are usually attainable if there is a small parameter in a model .",
    "the difficulty in direct solving the fokker - planck equation comes from the fact that both @xmath113 and @xmath114 depend on two variables , namely , @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "a new feature of our present study as compared with paper i is the dependence of the linear coefficient given by eq .",
    "( [ a.2.e1 ] ) on @xmath7 . when @xmath87 , the variations of @xmath123 ( see eq .",
    "( [ a.2.e ] ) are small .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath7 can be found by comparing our predictions with direct numerical simulations whenever such simulations become available .",
    "therefore for the time being , we study paramagnetic alignment assuming that @xmath7 is our second small parameter .",
    "fortunately , for many cases of practical importance @xmath7 is small ( lr ) .      if @xmath124 , @xmath0 precesses in body coordinates .",
    "purcell ( 1979 ) was the first to realize that this must entail internal dissipation of energy on relatively short time scales . according to purcell ( 1979 )",
    "the most important mechanism of internal dissipation is the barnett dissipation .",
    "this relaxation arises from alternating magnetization caused by precessing barnett moment ( see previous section ) . for a thermally rotating grain of size @xmath125 cm ,",
    "the barnett - equivalent magnetic field is @xmath126  g , which is substantially stronger than interstellar magnetic field .. this , however , may not alter our results here , provided that the relaxation happens on the time - scale much less than the time of gaseous damping .",
    "] therefore the rate of relaxation , which scales as @xmath127 , is nearly @xmath128 times faster than the paramagnetic alignment .",
    "the mean value of @xmath132 can be found as @xmath133 where the subscript @xmath14 indicates that the value for is calculated for an individual grain with a fixed angular momentum .",
    "the value of @xmath0 varies for different grains within an ensamble . to find the mean value of @xmath132 for the ensemble of grains , @xmath134 , one has to average over the distribution of @xmath14 .",
    "however , numerical studies of barnett alignment in lr95 have shown that with a high degree of accuracy one can find @xmath134 by substituting the mean value of angular momentum corresponding to rotational temperature @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ ddis ] ) .",
    "this phenomenological fact greatly simplifies our treatment and here we want to provide a theoretical justification for it by studying assymptotics of the barnett relaxation in the limit @xmath87 .      for small @xmath7 ,",
    "the @xmath7-dependence of the linear coefficient is weak ( [ a.2.e1 ] ) .",
    "thus we fix angle @xmath138 and find @xmath139 where @xmath140    a study of eq .",
    "( [ funct ] ) reveals only a weak dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath7 and this corresponds to calculations in lr performed for different distributions of @xmath7 .",
    "this means that our perturbative solution describes essential physics for @xmath87 .",
    "further on in the paper we use the phenomenological result of lr and calculate the measure of internal alignment @xmath13 by substituting the ensemble averaged value of @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ ddis ] ) . in the absence of paramagnetic relaxation ,",
    "the maxwellian mean value of angular momentum should be used ( landau & lifshitz 1980 ) : @xmath141 in the presence of paramagnetic dissipation , this value can still be used as the zeroth approximation for @xmath142 to obtain the zeroth order approximation for @xmath88 and diffusion coefficients .    in general , paramagnetic relaxation diminishes the value of @xmath14 .",
    "paramagnetic alignment decreases the component of @xmath0 perpendicular to magnetic field and does not affect the component of @xmath0 parallel to the field .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to conjecture that the component of @xmath0 parallel to magnetic field stays maxwellian and @xmath143 can be substituted instead of eq .",

    "equations  ( [ jjj1 ] ) , ( [ f_beta ] ) , ( [ e_beta ] ) and ( [ ddis ] ) enable one to obtain higher order iterations of the alignment measures .      we start with assuming @xmath145 and @xmath146",

    "using eqs  ( [ ddis ] ) and ( [ d42 ] ) , we can find @xmath158-th iterations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see eqs  ( [ two ] ) and ( [ three ] ) ) . then eq .",
    "( [ rail ] ) gives us the rayleigh reduction factor and this solves the problem .",
    "it is possible to show that the corresponding formal series converge and the error of the zero approximation does not exceed ten percent for a wide range of ratios of magnetic to damping times and grain to gas temperatures .",
    "we stress `` formal '' , however , as in our perturbative treatment we substitute particular values of @xmath165 and @xmath166 instead of the distributions of those angles .",
    "therefore a direct check of our results by testing against numerical simulations for a wide range of @xmath167 and @xmath168 is necessary .",
    "although , the corresponding numerical study is a challenging problem far more involved than the numerical simulations performed so far we hope that it can be accomplished ( roberge & lazarian 1997 , in preparation ) .      an important case of grains that can be paramagnetically aligned is `` supergrains '' ( grains with superparamagnetic or superferromagnetic properties ) suggested in jones & spitzer ( 1967 ) ( see also draine 1996 ) . indeed ,",
    "ordinary paramagnetic grains are only marginally aligned in typical interstellar conditions cm , which are responsible for the observed polarization ( kim & martin 1995 ) .",
    "one may erroneously assume that due to the dependence of @xmath167 on grain size ( see eq .",
    "( [ d41 ] ) ) small grain should be efficiently aligned .",
    "for those grains , however , one has to account for disorientation of grains through thermal emission and this decreases @xmath167 . ] and therefore can not account for observed polarization . on the contrary , `` supergrains '' may be efficiently aligned and can account for the peculiarities of the polarization curve ( mathis 1986 , martin see also goodman & whittet 1996 ) .",
    "such grains rapidly dissipate their energy by interacting with external magnetic field , and their ratio of gaseous to magnetic damping time is much greater than unity",

    "( [ aleph_i ] ) gives @xmath171 , which coincides with the result obtained in jones & spitzer ( 1967 ) for spherical superparamagnetic grains .",
    "in comparing our present results with those obtained in paper i we want to define clearly the ranges of applicability of the corresponding formalisms .    our results in paper",
    "i are applicable to grains , which have rotational temperature much greater than the temperature of grain material . in this limit",
    "the alignment of @xmath0 in the grain frame of reference is almost perfect and the measure of alignment can be obtained through the iteration procedure .",
    "apart from a trivial case of @xmath180 it is likely that the treatment presented in paper i is applicable if active sites of h@xmath181 formation cover the entire surface of grains and therefore h@xmath181 formation is essentially stochastic ( cugnon 1985 ) .",
    "such a chaotic formation of h@xmath181 molecules can make grains `` rotationally hot '' ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "cosmic rays can also spin up grains in particular regions through the process of momentum deposition described in purcell & spitzer ( 1971 ) , though really huge fluxes of cosmic rays are needed for the purpose .",
    "as compared with paper  i , the formalism presented in the present paper is more versatile .",
    "indeed , it allows to find the measure of the davis - greenstein alignment for finite @xmath183 ratios .",
    "unlike all earlier papers on the davis - greenstein alignment the present one accounts for a recently discovered phenomenon of incomplete internal relaxation .",
    "this enables one to find the rayleigh reduction factor for oblate grains with high accuracy .",
    "our results are especially important for superparamagnetic and superferromagnetic grains .",
    "fortunately , for such grains the formal treatment of the problem of @xmath0 alignment in respect to magnetic field is similar to that in paper i. the accuracy of the latter treatment was proved through numerical simulations and this makes us optimistic about the applicability of our results to `` supergrains '' for a wide range of grain and gas temperatures .    for ordinary paramagnetic grains ,",
    "our analytical results are obtained in the limit of small deviations of @xmath0 from the axis of major inertia .",
    "although formally it is possible to iterate for arbitrary deviations and obtain converging series for the solution , we believe that more numerical studies are needed to test our results for finite @xmath7 .",

    "<S> paramagnetic alignment of thermally rotating oblate dust grains is studied analytically for finite ratios of grain to gas temperatures . for such ratios , </S>",
    "<S> the alignment of angular momentum @xmath0 in respect to the grain axis of maximal inertia is only partial . </S>",
    "<S> we treat the alignment of @xmath0 using perturbative methods and disentangle the problem of @xmath0 alignment in grain body axes from that of @xmath0 alignment in respect to magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to find the alignment of grain axes to magnetic field and thus relate our theory to polarimetric observations . </S>",
    "<S> our present results are applicable to the alignment of both paramagnetic and superparamagnetic grains . </S>"
