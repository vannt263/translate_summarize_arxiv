    "the rice array is designed to detect events in which a neutrino - nucleon scattering event initiates a compact electromagnetic cascade in ice .",
    "such cascades carry a net negative electric charge of magnitude 0.25@xmath3/gev , resulting in a pulse of radio cherenkov emission via the `` askaryan effect''@xcite , with power peaked at wavelengths comparable to the lateral dimensions of the cascade , i.e. , the moliere radius ( @xmath410 cm ) .",
    "this paper reports new limits from the rice array , updating the previous limits from 2006@xcite , and also discusses how recent radio frequency ( rf ) studies of ice properties will impact new initiatives at south pole .",
    "development of radio frequency detectors to measure ultra - high energy cosmic ray interactions has recently intensified .",
    "projects use several methods and target materials including salt@xcite , ice@xcite and lunar regolith@xcite .",
    "complementary efforts seek to measure the rf signals in cosmic ray - induced extensive air showers@xcite .",
    "while calculations of rf signals from cosmic rays first appeared nearly 70 years ago@xcite , the new technology of nanosecond - scale digitizers and massive multi - channel data analysis are now bringing the potential of radio detection to fruition .",
    "radio - wavelength detection of electromagnetic showers in ice relies on two experimentally established phenomena - long attenuation lengths exceeding 1 km , and coherence extending up to 1 ghz for cherenkov emission .",
    "discussions of the askaryan effect@xcite upon which the radiowave detection technique is founded , its experimental verification in a testbeam environment@xcite , calculations of the expected radio - frequency signal from a purely electromagnetic shower@xcite , as well as hadronic showers@xcite , and modifications due to the lpm effect@xcite can be found in the literature .",
    "all estimates give the same qualitative conclusion - at large distances , the signal at the antenna inputs is a symmetric pulse , approximately 1 - 2 ns wide in the time domain . on the cherenkov cone ,",
    "the power spectrum rises monotonically with frequency , as expected in the coherent long - wavelength limit . in that limit ,",
    "the excess negative charge in the shower front ( roughly one electron per 4 gev shower energy ) can be treated as a single ( `` coherent '' ) source charge . for perfect signal transmission ( no cable signal losses ) through an electrically matched system , calculations estimate the cherenkov - cone signal strength due to a 1 pev neutrino initiating a shower at r=1 km from an antenna to be @xmath5 , with b the system bandwidth in ghz .",
    "this is comparable to the 300 k thermal noise over that bandwidth in the same antenna , prior to amplification .",
    "previous rice publications described initial limits on the incident neutrino flux@xcite , calibration procedures@xcite , ice properties measurements@xcite , and successor analyses of micro - black hole production@xcite , gamma - ray burst production of uhe neutrinos@xcite , tightened limits on the diffuse neutrino flux@xcite and a search for magnetic monopoles@xcite",
    ". herein we update both our diffuse neutrino search , based on the entire data sample , using algorithms which differ minimally from our preceding search , and also provide new information derived from radioglaciological studies of the ice dielectric permittivity at radio wavelengths .",
    "figure [ fig : viewer.eps ]        shows the detector geometry ( essentially unchanged since 2000 ) in relation to the martin a. pomerantz observatory ( mapo ) at south pole station .",
    "the sensitive detector elements , radio receivers , are submerged at depths of several hundred meters close to the geographic south pole , in holes primarily drilled for the amanda experiment .",
    "six of the rice receivers are deployed in ` dry ' holes drilled specifically for rice in 1998 - 99 . despite bulk motion of the ice sheet , and the closing of those dry holes under the ambient hydrostatic pressure over @xmath45 years",
    ", we continue to receive signals from all successfully deployed antennas . a block diagram of the experiment , showing the signal path from in - ice to the surface electronics , is shown in figure [ fig : rice - block - diagram.xfig.eps ] .    1.5 microseconds ) .",
    "the trigger latch initiates readout of an 8.192 microsecond waveform sample , digitized at 1 gsa / s.__,width=566 ]    the primary sensors are the in - ice ` fat - dipoles ' , which have good bandwidth over the frequency interval 200 - 1000 mhz , and a beam pattern consistent with the expected @xmath6 dependence for wavelengths larger than the physical scale of the dipole antenna , as verified in transmitter tests ( figure [ fig : rxcostheta ] ) performed while lowering a transmitter dipole antenna into a dry borehole .    ) .",
    "dipole antennas , which are expected to follow a @xmath7 field beam pattern should show a reduction in a factor of 2 ( @xmath6 ) for broadcasts between two vertically aligned antennas , between @xmath8=0 and @xmath9 , roughly consistent with observation.__,width=491 ]      the statistics of the complete data taken thus far with the rice array are summarized in table [ tab : datasum ] .",
    ".__summary of rice data taken through december , 2010 .",
    "`` 4-hit triggers '' refer to all events for which there are at least four rice antennas registering voltages exceeding a pre - set discriminator threshold in a coincidence time comparable to the light transit time across the array ( @xmath10s ) ; `` unbiased triggers '' correspond to the total number of events taken at pre - specified intervals and are intended to capture background conditions within the array ; `` veto triggers '' are events tagged online by a fast ( @xmath410 ms / event ) software algorithm as consistent with having a surface origin . with the cessation of amanda operations in march , 2009 , beginning in february 2010",
    ", the `` amanda '' trigger line was replaced by a 3-fold surface - antenna multiplicity trigger .",
    "variations in the veto rate are attributed to the commissioning of new experiments , with associated anthropogenic electromagnetic interference , and also the decommissioning of other experiments , as well as communications streams such as the goes satellite in 2006 . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      thus far , virtually all information on the radio frequency response of ice sheets has been derived using vertically broadcast signals . in the austral summer of 2011 - 12",
    ", rice hardware will be used to broadcast rf at largely oblique angles , which will provide information on the ice response away from the @xmath11-axis , and more typical of the geometry of the neutrino signals to be detected by in - ice experiments such as rice . as illustrated above ,",
    "all rice studies done thus far , however , substantiate the basic premise of such detectors : that the excellent rf properties of cold polar ice imply that englacial neutrino detectors provide the most cost effective technique for confronting the cosmogenic neutrino flux .      during the austral summer of 2010 - 11 , initial deployments of the next generation of neutrino detection hardware ,",
    "realized as the recently funded askaryan radio array ( ara@xcite ) , were made at the south pole .",
    "the first ara deployment , in the form of a relatively shallow ( 2030 m ) `` testbed '' prototype has already demonstrated 20 arc - minute angular reconstruction of calibration antennas , as well as sensitivity to variations in the received galactic noise and rf emissions from solar flares .",
    "an ambitious proposal , including 14 institutions from eight countries has been submitted to develop an autonomously - powered ( and therefore , arbitrarily scaleable ) experiment capable of initially defining the cosmogenic neutrino flux , and , over the timescale of a decade , eventually performing statistical characterization of that flux .    comprising 37 stations , each individually with an energy reach approximately an order of magnitude below that of rice",
    ", ara will achieve a nearly 100-fold improvement in total effective volume , achieved via :    1 .",
    "direct digitization at the sensor ( antenna ) rather than on the surface , eliminating the @xmath415 db signal losses typically incurred by conveyance through coaxial cable .",
    "order - of - magnitude reduction of the geometric scale of each `` station '' from the 200-m typical of rice such that the temporal signal coincidence window can similarly be narrowed by a comparable factor of 10 .",
    "siting of the experiment several km from the main south pole station itself , resulting in considerably lower ambient noise rates .",
    "the remote ara deployment site exhibits virtually none of the anthropogenic , or wind - generated rfi that plaged the rice data sample .",
    "extension of the lower - frequency limit of the antenna response from the current 250 mhz to @xmath4150 mhz , resulting in improved response to off - cherenkov - peak signals .",
    "`` optimized '' antenna receiver placement , as opposed to the requirement that rice co - deploy in boreholes being drilled for the amanda experiment .",
    "the 2011 - 12 austral season will include the first deployment of a full - fledged ara station ( `` ara-1 '' ) ; that single station will , in one year , have equivalent neutrino sensitivity to the ten years of rice data accumulated thus far and reported herein .",
    "the first results on neutrino searches from the ara testbed should be forthcoming within the next few months .",
    "the authors particular thank chris allen ( u. of kansas ) for very helpful discussions , as well as our colleagues on the rice and anita experiments .",
