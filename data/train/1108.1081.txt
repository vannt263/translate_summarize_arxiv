    "the main result of  @xcite can now be summarised by the fact that the cohomology @xmath22 of @xmath21 is an invariant of  @xmath3 which is conveniently encoded in the poincar polynomial @xmath23 this is indeed a more refined invariant than the uncategorified @xmath0 link invariant of  @xcite which can be recovered as the graded euler characteristic @xmath24 .",
    "there is also a `` reduced '' version of the above construction which leads to link invariants @xmath25 that _ a priori _ depend on the choice of a component  @xmath26 of  @xmath3 .",
    "since the definition of khovanov - rozansky homology is very explicit , one might expect that these invariants can be computed in a straightforward way .",

    "we mitigate this problem by inserting an intermediate step , which we call _ web compilation _ , based on techniques developed in @xcite .    to see the problem more clearly ,",
    "let us consider the general situation of two matrix factorisations @xmath17 of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , where  @xmath31 has an isolated singularity at the origin .",

    "however , only recently a general construction of  @xmath35 as well as the isomorphism @xmath36 was given in  @xcite .",
    "we reformulate the details of the construction in section  [ compilewebs ] , but the main idea is that first one `` inflates '' the matrix of the differential of @xmath19 by replacing each @xmath37-monomial by the matrix that represents its multiplication on the jacobian @xmath38/(\\partial_{y_{i } } w_{2})$ ] in some chosen basis .",

    "in particular we compute unreduced and reduced khovanov - rozansky homology for all prime links with up to 6 crossings for various values of  @xmath1 .",
    "our method could be straightforwardly applied to compute the coloured homological @xmath0 link invariants of  @xcite , to the categorification of the kauffman polynomial and to virtual links  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately our approach is not applicable to the categorification  @xcite of the homfly polynomial , as the potentials that occur in this theory are not isolated singularities .",
    "let us mention another motivation : the fusion of topological defects in landau - ginzburg models .",
    "the latter are two - dimensional topological field theories which govern the `` physics '' of domains on a worldsheet .",
    "the boundary conditions at the line separating two neighbouring domains are called defects , see e.g.  @xcite . if two such domains are governed by landau - ginzburg models with potentials @xmath43 and @xmath31 , then the defects are described by matrix factorisations  @xmath44 of @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "one may also consider more than two domains and defects between them .",
    "for example , there can be a defect  @xmath44 between theories @xmath43 and @xmath31 , and another defect  @xmath46 between @xmath31 and @xmath47 .",
    "because of their topological nature ( and in the absence of field insertions in the domain with potential  @xmath31 ) the defects may be moved arbitrarily close to one another .",
    "the limit of this process is called the fusion of the two defects , and it is described by the matrix factorisation @xmath19  @xcite . computing a finite - rank representative of this tensor product in the homotopy category of matrix factorisations represents the process of `` integrating out '' the `` unphysical '' variables on which @xmath48 depends . in this way",
    "fusion endows the set of all landau - ginzburg models with the structure of a bicategory  @xcite .    with this interpretation in mind",
    "let us now briefly revisit the resolutions   in terms of the matrix factorisations   that are at the heart of the khovanov - rozansky construction .",
    "it is natural to interpret  @xmath9 and  @xmath10 as defects between landau - ginzburg models with potentials @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in this sense computing khovanov - rozansky invariants",
