    "let @xmath2 be a fuchsian group , meaning a discrete subgroup of the group of orientation preserving isometries of @xmath3 , the hyperbolic plane .",
    "a boundary point of @xmath3 fixed by a parabolic element of a fuchsian group @xmath2 is referred to as a _ cusp _ of @xmath2 , and a line fixed by a hyperbolic element is referred to as an _ axis _ with endpoints called hyperbolic fixed points . for an arbitrary fuchsian group , determining its set of cusps , hyperbolic fixed points , and/or axes is quite a challenge ; for some of the literature addressing this type of problem , see @xcite and its references .",
    "recall that fuchsian groups @xmath4 and @xmath5 are _ commensurable _ if @xmath4 has a subgroup of finite index which is conjugate to a subgroup of finite index in @xmath5 .",
    "this work has been motivated by the following question(s ) :    if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are finite covolume fuchsian groups with the same set of cusps ( or same set of axes ) , when are they commensurable ?    in @xcite , long and reid exhibit four examples of mutually noncommensurable subgroups of @xmath6 , which are not commensurable with the modular group , but each of them have cusp set exactly @xmath7 ; they call such groups _ pseudomodular_. it is still unknown whether or not there are infinitely many pseudomodular groups up to commensurability .",
    "any other possible candidate for pseudomodular groups are ( non - arithmetic ) discrete subgroups @xmath8 , since their cusp set is contained in @xmath7 . for fuchsian groups , a boundary point can not both be a cusp and a hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "hence arithmetic and pseudomodular groups can not have rational hyperbolic fixed points .",
    "so if one can exhibit a hyperbolic element of @xmath0 that has rational fixed points , then @xmath0 s cusp set is properly contained in @xmath7 ; thus showing @xmath0 to be neither arithmetic nor pseudomodular .",
    "so long and reid asked , how to predict when rational hyperbolic fixed points are present .",
    "another motivation arises from a question a. rapinchuk asked .",
    "are there infinitely many commensurability classes of finite covolume fuchsian groups sitting in @xmath6 ?",
    "vinberg , answering this question in a preprint @xcite , has introduced a way to produce infinitely many noncommensurable finite covolume fuchsian groups in @xmath9 .",
    "his examples arise as the even subgroup of a group generated by reflections in the sides of quadrilaterals . to establish that he constructed infinitely many groups up to commensurability",
    ", vinberg uses results ( from @xcite ) about the least ring of definition for his examples .",
    "this paper provides a new solution to rapinchuk s question , which is different from vinberg s , and the results also address the presence of rational hyperbolic fixed points .",
    "namely , we will construct fuchsian groups sitting in @xmath6 , all of which will possess a given finite set of rational hyperbolic fixed points .",
    "the main result is    let @xmath10 be a finite set of rational boundary points of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "then there are infinitely many noncommensurable finite covolume fuchsian groups sitting in @xmath6 , whose set of hyperbolic fixed points contains @xmath10 .",
    "this will be proved in section [ prooft ] . as a brief outline ,",
    "let @xmath10 be a finite number of boundary points of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "we construct ( with considerable freedom ) examples of fuchsian groups @xmath2 of signature @xmath11 such that the set of hyperbolic fixed points of @xmath2 contains @xmath10 ( see section [ constg ] ) ; furthermore , when @xmath10 is a set of rational boundary points , and by restricting some of the freedom in the construction , one can guarantee @xmath12 .",
    "then we address when the constructed groups are mutually noncommensurable , which relies on analyzing how they act on different trees ( see section [ sltrees ] ) .",
    "specifically , we consider fixed points of the action of @xmath2 on serre s trees of @xmath13 for primes @xmath14 ( see proposition [ nolstab ] ) .",
    "this perspective allows us to construct an infinite family of mutually noncommensurable groups in @xmath6 .",
    "the author is grateful to the university of texas at austin for their support during the summer and fall of 2012 .",
    "i am indebted to my advisor daniel allcock for all the conversations we had during my work on this project and in particular for his careful reading of this manuscript .",
    "i would also like to thank alan reid for helpful discussions about pseudomodular groups .",
    "in this section , we will construct a fundamental domain for a fuchsian group @xmath2 of signature @xmath11 so that the set of hyperbolic fixed points of @xmath2 , notated by @xmath15 , will contain a given finite set @xmath10 of elements in boundary of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "before the construction begins , we introduce some notation and a lemma .",

    "we will write @xmath16 for the closure of the geodesic line with end points @xmath17 in the closure of @xmath3 .",
