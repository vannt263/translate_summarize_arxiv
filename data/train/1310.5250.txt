    "scalar multiplication on elliptic curves ( or jacobians of genus 2 curves ) is a key operation in many modern asymmetric cryptographic primitives .",
    "the classic scenario is as follows : let @xmath1 be a cyclic subgroup of order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an elliptic curve or an abelian surface over a finite field  @xmath4 . given an integer @xmath5 ( typically on the order of @xmath2 ) and a point @xmath6 in @xmath7 , our goal is to compute @xmath8p : = \\underbrace{p + p + \\cdots + p}_{m \\text { times } } \\ ] ] as quickly as possible .    since elliptic curve scalar multiplication is analogous to exponentiation in finite fields , many algorithms originally developed with the multiplicative groups of finite fields ( or general abelian groups ) in mind transfer directly to scalar multiplication : square - and - multiply loops in finite fields",
    "become double - and - add loops on elliptic curves , for example .",
    "however , the geometry of elliptic curves can offer us new algorithms with no true finite field analogues .",
    "a spectacular ( and easy ) example of this phenomemon is scalar multiplication with endomorphism decompositions , originally proposed by gallant , lambert , and vanstone  @xcite .",
    "we present a general version of their idea below that is flexible enough to accommodate higher - dimensional and higher - genus constructions .",
    "let @xmath3 , @xmath7 , and @xmath2 be as above , and let @xmath9 be @xmath4-endomorphisms of @xmath3 .",
    "we lose nothing by supposing @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , we do _ not _ suppose that the @xmath11 form a linearly independent set .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 for @xmath13 ( this is the typical situation in cryptographic applications , where @xmath2 is so close to @xmath14 that there is no room for the image of @xmath7 to be anything but @xmath7 itself ) ; then each @xmath11 restricts to an endomorphism of @xmath7 . but @xmath7 is a cyclic group , isomorphic to @xmath15 , and as such each of its endomorphisms is multiplication by some integer ( defined modulo @xmath2 ) .",
    "in particular , each endomorphism @xmath11 acts on @xmath7 as multiplication by an integer _ eigenvalue _",

    "first , consider the lattice of decompositions of @xmath34 : @xmath35 the set of decompositions of any @xmath5 in @xmath15 is then the lattice coset @xmath36    to find a short decomposition of @xmath5 , we can subtract a nearby vector in @xmath37 from @xmath38 . the reference technique for finding such a vector in @xmath37",
    "is babai rounding  @xcite , which works as follows : if @xmath39 is a basis for @xmath37 , then we let @xmath40 be the ( unique ) solution in @xmath41 to the linear system @xmath42 and set @xmath43 then @xmath44 is an @xmath21-dimensional decomposition of @xmath5 . since @xmath45 and @xmath46 for any @xmath47 in @xmath0 , we have @xmath48    it is clear , therefore , that finding short decompositions depends on finding a short basis for @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath37 depends only on the @xmath11 , and not on the eventual scalars @xmath5 or points @xmath6 to be multiplied ; as such , the short basis can ( and should ) be precomputed . assuming that the eigenvalues have pairwise differences of absolute value at least @xmath49 , there exists a basis with @xmath50 in @xmath51 , which will yield scalar decompositions of bitlength around @xmath52 .    in most of the scalar decomposition literature ,",
    "a short basis of @xmath37 is produced by starting with a long basis typically the basis @xmath53 before applying a lattice reduction algorithm to produce a short basis .",
    "for @xmath23 , gallant , lambert , and vanstone used the euclidean algorithm , which is equivalent to the usual gauss lattice reduction algorithm ( though kaib s algorithm for the infinity norm  @xcite may give marginally better results ) .",
    "in higher dimensions , we would typically use a fast lll variant ( such as ` fplll `  @xcite)though longa and sica  @xcite went so far as to propose a new 4-dimensional lattice basis reduction algorithm for their glv+gls construction on elliptic curves .",
    "our contention in this article is that in most cryptographic situations , no lattice basis reduction is required to find a short basis of @xmath37 : one can simply write down vectors of length at most @xmath54 from scratch .",
    "the information that allows us to do so is typically a by - product of the group order computation ( or of the cm method ) . for the abelian varieties most useful in cryptography ,",
    "these vectors either form a basis for @xmath37 , or can be easily modified to do so .",
    "galbraith , lin , and scott  @xcite and the author  @xcite have already constructed families of endomorphisms equipped with a convenient ready - made basis ; in this work , we generalize these ready - made bases to all of the other known efficient endomorphism constructions for elliptic curves and to real multiplication techniques for genus 2 jacobians . in this way , we construct explicit short bases for the galbraith ",

    "smith  @xcite and takashima  @xcite methods for genus 2 jacobians .",
    "we do not pretend that this is a significant optimization for scalar decomposition methods : the construction of a short basis is essentially a one - shot precomputation , and existing lattice basis reduction methods are certainly fast enough on the relevant input sizes .",
    "however , the construction of these `` instant '' bases turns out to be an illuminating exercise : short bases can be read off from they are simple endomorphism ring relations that are , in practice , known in advance .",
    "the bottom line is that it is always more convenient to not compute something than it is to compute it .",
    "we recall some elementary facts from the theory of quadratic fields .",
    "further details and proofs can be found in almost any basic algebraic number theory text ( we recommend  @xcite ) .",
