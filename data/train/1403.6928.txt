    "quantum technologies often comprise quantum systems interconnected with classical ( non - quantum ) devices .",

    "the classical controller processes the outcomes of a measurement of an observable of the cavity on the left hand side ( e.g. the quadrature of an optical field ) .",
    "modulating the quantum field with the classical controller output by mod generates another quantum field sent to the cavity on the right .",
    "the signals from the classical controller also govern the behavior of the classical system , which can be implemented by electrical and electronic devices .",
    "traditionally , such quantum optical networks would be implemented on an optics table .",
    "however , it is now becoming possible to consider implementation in semiconductor chips , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    ]    in classical engineering , many methods have been developed for designing controllers and electronic systems .",
    "the design process begins with some form of specification for the system , and concludes with a physical realization of the system that meets the specifications .",
    "often , mathematical models for the system are used in the design process , such as state space equations for the system .",
    "these state space equations may result from a mathematical optimization procedure , such as lqg , or some other procedure @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the process of going from such mathematical models to the desired physical systems is a process of _ synthesis _ or _ physical realization _ , part of the design methodologies widely used in classical engineering @xcite .",
    "the nature of the physical components to be used may restrict the range of , say , the state space models that can be used .",
    "for instance , capacitors , inductors and resistors can not by themselves implement non - passive devices like amplifiers .",

    "linear quantum optical systems may be described by linear quantum differential equations in the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these equations look superficially like the classical state space equations familiar to engineering , but in fact are fundamentally different because they are equations for quantum mechanical operators , not numerical variables . the purpose of this paper is to consider synthesis problems for a class of linear stochastic differential equations that may describe mixed quantum - classical systems .",
    "this class of equations is usually presented in a general form given in subsection [ g - form ] where the quantum - classical nature is captured in the matrices specifying the commutation relations of the system and signal ( e.g. boson field ) variables .",
    "however , the structure of a mixed quantum - classical system is not very clearly presented in a general form and we thus show how a mixed system described in general form can be linearly transformed into a standard form defined in subsection [ s - form ] , which reveals in a standard ( or canonical ) way the internal structure of a mixed quantum - classical system .",
    "furthermore , arbitrary linear stochastic differential equations for a general form or a standard form need not correspond to a physical system , and so we derive conditions ensuring that they do ; that is , physical realizability . this work generalizes and extends earlier work @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite",
