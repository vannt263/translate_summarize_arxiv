    "most stars tend to form together in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are created from over dense gas _ clumps _ , typically found in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . thus understanding how stars form comes with the direct need to understand how and where star clusters form",
    "it is still a matter of debate if star cluster formation depends on properties of the gmc environment or not .",
    "while theoretical studies have taught us the essential physical processes that determine a star cluster s evolution after gas is dispersed , the transition from the dense star - forming clump to the star cluster that emerges from the gas is not yet well understood ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "in particular , it is debated whether the process is slow with the clump evolving in a quasi - equilibrium state @xcite , or very rapid with star cluster formation occurring in just a crossing time of the system @xcite .",
    "there are numerous physical processes potentially involved in such a transition from gas clump to star cluster , including : fragmentation of a magnetized , turbulent and self - gravitating medium to a population of pre - stellar cores ; collapse of these cores via rotationally supported disks to single or multiple star systems ; feedback from the forming stars , especially protostellar outflows that can maintain turbulence in the clump @xcite , and eventually radiative feedback processes from more massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; continued infall of gas to the clump ; dispersal of clump gas by feedback ; dynamical interactions among the forming and recently formed stars as they orbit in the protocluster potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is a complicated , multi - scale problem , the full solution of which is beyond current computational capabilities .",
    "thus approximate models are necessary . by investigating how the outcome of star cluster formation depends on the adopted approximations we can learn which processes are most important .",
    "our approach in this paper and subsequent papers in this series is to follow the dynamics of formed stars , including binary properties , accurately via direct @xmath4-body integrations , but approximate various models for how individual stars are born within the star - forming clump .",
    "our initial conditions are based on the turbulent core / clump model of @xcite ( hereafter mt03 ) , which approximates clumps as singular polytropic virialized spheres that are in pressure equilibrium with their surrounding cloud medium .",
    "this surrounding cloud is also assumed to be self - gravitating so its ambient pressure is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the cloud mass surface density  the main variable describing different environmental conditions .    in this first paper , we start with the simplest approximation for star formation , i.e. , instantaneous formation of the stellar population from the initial gas clump along with simultaneous , instantaneous expulsion of the remaining gas that is not incorporated into stars .",
    "this approximation has often been adopted by previous @xmath4-body studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in comparison to these previous studies our work is distinguished by ( 1 ) adopting initial conditions that have been explicitly developed for self - gravitating gas clumps ( i.e. , singular polytropic spheres as approximations for turbulent , magnetized clumps ) ; ( 2 ) following the full evolution of binary systems .",
    "a number of authors have studied the dynamics of binaries in star clusters using numerical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , focusing on various aspects of their dynamics . in our work",
    "we follow the evolution of binary properties due to stellar interactions and stellar evolution in clusters forming in different environments .",
    "we use and will use these results to constrain assumptions about the star cluster process , e.g. , its duration , and individual star formation processes , e.g. , how binaries form , i.e. , the primordial binary properties .",
    "we also examine the role of binaries in producing dynamical and binary supernova ejections , especially fast runaway stars .",
    "we anticipate that , in reality , star cluster formation is likely to proceed in a relatively gradual manner , i.e. , taking at least several and perhaps many local free - fall timescales of the gas clump .",
    "modeling this process of gradual star cluster formation will be the topic of the second paper in this series .",
    "one aspect that is needed in such a model is the gradual evolution of the potential of the natal gas clump , which can be approximated via a simple analytic relation .",
    "such an approach of an evolving approximate background gas potential has been adopted previously by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , in all these studies the full stellar population was introduced instantaneously at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "none of these studies included a full treatment of binaries , i.e. , including a significant fraction of primordial binaries .",
    "the second aspect is the gradual formation of the stellar population in the cluster",
    ". this will be the main focus of paper ii in our series .",
    "there have so far been relatively few studies using such an approach .",
    "@xcite presented a study involving gradual star formation and then the early evolution of young clusters , focusing on low to intermediate mass clusters ( 100 to 3000 members ) , without primordial binaries .",
    "however , the stellar densities of their models were relatively low , limiting the effects of stellar interactions .",
    "they also did not include stellar evolution and only simulated up to 10  myr .",
    "these methods of @xmath4-body modeling can be contrasted with other approaches to simulating star cluster formation , e.g. , simulations that follow the ( magneto-)hydrodynamics of the collapsing clump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such simulations must still implement sub - grid models for how stars form and inject feedback into the gas .",
    "typically they do not have the resolution to accurately follow binary orbital evolution .",
    "still , these are complementary approaches to those based on pure @xmath4-body approaches and comparison of the results of the different methods will be instructive .",
    "the initial conditions for star clusters are constrained by the observed properties of dense gas clumps within gmcs .",
    "these locations are also expected to be the sites of future massive star formation .",
    "the properties of these clumps have been summarized by @xcite , based on galactic observational studies of infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there are a range of clump masses observed from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .    in the fiducial turbulent clump model ,",
    "the mass surface density of the clump of interest is only a factor of 1.22 times higher than that of its surrounding cloud .",
    "therefore the observed surface densities of clumps give a reasonable estimate of the mass surface densities of the ambient clouds , @xmath3 , which is the other main parameter needed to set up the initial conditions of the models .",
    "the observed values of mass surface density of galactic clumps and protoclusters are in the range from @xmath9@xmath2 .    in the setup of our initial conditions in this paper",
    "we make several simplifying assumptions as first steps in describing the complexity of star cluster formation : i ) the parent clump is isolated ( i.e. , no external tidal fields ) ; ii ) the clump is in hydrostatic and virial equilibrium with the structure of a singular polytropic sphere ; iii ) stars are born with the same velocities as their parent gas , so that their velocity dispersion profile is the same as that of the initial gas ; iv ) all stars form instantaneously and the remaining gas is also expelled instantaneously at this time ; iv ) the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) is spatially constant , which means that stars follow the same spatial distribution as the initial gas ; v ) there is no initial spatial or kinematic substructure given to the stars , except that which results from random , poisson sampling ; vi ) following an initial test model of equal mass stars , a standard kroupa imf for the stars @xcite is adopted , then with various binary properties investigated .",
    "it should be remembered that these are starting assumptions and that many of these will be relaxed in subsequent investigations .",
    "however , first the behavior of this simplest , idealized model needs to be understood .",
    "first we define the physical and kinematic properties of the pre - cluster clump , i.e. , mass , size , density profile and velocity dispersion profile .",
    "stars are born from this clump and initially follow the same phase - space ( position , velocity ) distribution .",
    "characterize pre - cluster clumps and pre - stellar cores as singular polytropic spheres in virial and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the density profile of such clumps is then : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the density at the surface of the clump , i.e. , at radius @xmath12 .",
    "we adopt @xmath13 as a fiducial value , i.e. , the same as that of who made their choice based on observations of clumps reported at the time .",
    "no significant difference has been found in later measurements performed by @xcite in irdcs where they found @xmath14 .",
    "we thus keep @xmath13 as our fiducial value for simplicity and consistency with the previous analysis of .",
    "the density at the surface of the clump can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total mass of the clump .",
    "the radius of a clump in virial equilibrium and pressure equilibrium with its surroundings , i.e. , a larger self - gravitating cloud of given mass surface density , @xmath3 , is (;",
    "@xcite , hereafter t13 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the power law exponent of the pressure ( @xmath19 ) within the clump ; @xmath20 is the ratio between the pressure at the surface of the clump ( @xmath21 ) and the mean pressure inside the cloud , @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is a normalization constant , @xmath24 , in the relation @xmath25 ; and @xmath26 , since we assume the clump is initially starless so @xmath27 . as fiducial values we choose @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus the structural properties of the fiducial clump are specified by two parameters : @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in this study",
    "we will focus on the case of @xmath32 and investigate @xmath1 and @xmath33 , which are representative of the range of values observed in real clumps @xcite .",
    "the total mass of stars , @xmath34 , that form from the clump is given @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the overall sfe .",
    "we will consider a range of values from @xmath37 to 1 , with a fiducial value of 0.5 .",
    "the stars are assumed to have the same structural profile as the clump , i.e. , @xmath36 is independent of radial location .",
    "then , the density profile of the stars is simply : @xmath38 .",
    "the cumulative radial mass distribution of the stars is @xmath39 to set up the positions of the stars , we first create the mass sample from a given imf ( including binary companions ) , i.e. , in the fiducial case a standard kroupa imf @xcite with individual masses in the range @xmath40 , in random order .",
    "next , we create a cumulative mass array from the previous sample to then choose the individual distance from the center @xmath41 according to eq .",
    "[ eq : mstars ] ( in the case of 100% mass segregation , see below , masses are sorted from the most massive to the less massive before this step ) .",
    "finally , we place the star randomly on the surface of the sphere of radius @xmath41 . in this way",
    "we ensure that the clusters always match the desired initial density profile , no matter the nature of the stellar imf .",
    "the kinematic properties of the clump are specified by the condition of virial equilibrium . in a virialized clump ,",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath42 scales in the same manner as the effective sound speed @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the velocity dispersion profile of the clump is : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the velocity dispersion at the surface of the clump .",
    "the presence of large - scale magnetic fields can provide some support to the clump so that a smaller turbulent velocity dispersion is needed to achieve virial equilibrium .",
    "the effect of magnetic fields on the stability of the clump can be expressed as @xmath46 .",
    "then , the velocity dispersion at the surface is : @xmath47 where we use @xmath48 as a fiducial value , which is the value for regions with an alfvn mach number of 1 . the initial velocity dispersion profile of the stars then follows eq .  [ eq : sigmar ] .",
    "the individual stellar velocities are then assigned velocities in each of the @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 directions independently by drawing from a gaussian centered at zero with width @xmath52 .",
    "note that the mass averaged velocity dispersion of the clump / cluster is @xmath53 the resulting velocity distribution has the form of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution with @xmath54 but with a one dimensional velocity dispersion profile as in equation [ eq : sigmar ] .",
    "the properties of the clumps , i.e. , the low and high @xmath6 cases , are summarized in table  [ tab : clumps ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      observational evidence shows that about half of star systems in the field are binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "given the densities of star - forming clumps and young star clusters , it is likely that most of these binaries where born together inside individual cores , rather then forming via subsequent dynamical interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , this is a question that our simulations will be able to address .",
    "theoretically , a full understanding of binary formation from a collapsing gas core is likely to require a full non - ideal mhd treatment to resolve formation of the accretion disk and then later its potential fragmentation .",
    "the difficulty of this problem means that essentially the statistical properties of primordial binaries are very uncertain , and so we will investigate several different choices based on observations .    for most of our simulations that include binaries , we assume a binary system fraction , @xmath55 .",
    "we adopt a period distribution from the survey @xcite using a log - normal period distribution with mean of @xmath56 years and standard deviation of @xmath57 ( with @xmath19 in days ) .",
    "we use a companion mass ratio distribution ( cmrd ) of the form @xmath58 , based on observations in young star clusters @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity distribution remains less well constrained . while @xcite found a thermal distribution , i.e. , @xmath59 for solar - type stars in the solar neighborhood , a similar more recent study @xcite found a flat eccentricity distribution for the same kind of stars .",
    "however , if binaries form mainly via disk fragmentation we would expect that they are born with near circular orbits . in order to measure",
    "how much binaries are affected by dynamical interactions in the different models we adopt initially circular orbits for the eccentricities in our fiducial model .",
    "we also investigate cases with initially thermal and uniform distributions of eccentricities .      for each of the low and high @xmath6 clumps ( see table  [ tab : clumps ] )",
    ", we set up a stellar cluster as described above , i.e. , assuming constant sfe@xmath60 and a velocity dispersion profile equal to that of the parent clump .",
    "thus , the initial crossing time ( i.e. , dynamical time ) is defined by the properties of the parent clump to be @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the @xmath1 and @xmath64 cases , respectively .",
    "we run 20 realizations for each set of initial conditions , summarized in table [ tab : ic ] .",
    "the simulations are run for 20 myr , varying only the random seed between simulations in the same set , which affects the initial positions and velocities of the stars as well as the imf sampling .",
    "we construct these sets of simulations starting from the simplest case to the one that defines our fiducial case .",
    "we start using only single mass particles of @xmath65 with no primordial binaries and with a sfe of 50% in the set .",
    "next , we include an imf assuming the @xcite distribution with a mass range from 0.01 to @xmath66 defining the set , again with no initial binaries .",
    "we then include 50% primordial binaries with circular orbits and with other properties described in  [ sec : binary ] , defining the set .",
    "the above three simulation sets do not include stellar evolution ( se ) .",
    "we define the simulation set by assuming a kroupa imf , sfe of 50% , with 50% of stars as primordial binary systems with initial circular orbits and with stellar evolution included .",
    "next , we test other choices and parameters of the fiducial model .",
    "we test two other eccentricity distributions , a thermal eccentricity distribution , i.e. , @xmath59 in the set , and a uniform eccentricity distribution between 0 and 1 in the set .",
    "an extreme scenario of mass segregation is tested in the set in which stars are sorted in descending order of individual stellar mass from the center of the cluster .",
    "we also test the extreme case in which all stars are binary systems ( @xmath67 ) in the set .",
    "we also carry out simulations with different sfe .",
    "these simulations only differ from the set in their sfe , i.e. , the average number of stars per simulation on each set increases with the sfe since we use the same parent clump of @xmath68 .",

    "[ sec : qi ] , star clusters born from turbulent clumps bounded by high pressure ambient environments can start with relatively high velocity dispersions .",
    "their virial ratio after gas expulsion will depend on the global sfe and the contribution of magnetic fields to the support of the parent clump , i.e @xmath71 .",
    "there will be significant initial mass loss of the stars that are born unbound , occurring on a timescale of a few crossing times .",
    "however , the gaseous clump is assumed to have a positive power law for the velocity dispersion with radius ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] ) and so is more likely to be left with a central gravitationally bound core .",
    "in contrast , a relaxed star cluster ( e.g. , with a plummer profile ) has a velocity dispersion profile that decreases with radius .",
    "we thus expect differences in the early evolution of our clusters compared to those modeled with initial plummer profiles by , e.g. @xcite .    to measure the bound mass fraction , @xmath93 , at each timestep of cluster evolution .",
    "we construct the bound entity based on an accurate measure of the mean velocity of the bound stars and we select all stars with negative total energy in the frame of reference of the bound cluster .",
    "the velocity of the bound cluster is not known _ a priori _ ( although it is expected to be close to the zero velocity of the reference frame ) , and thus this is solved in an iterative calculation .",
    "we start by selecting all stars with negative energy inside the half mass radius of the full cluster and then iterate until the members between iterations do not change by more than two members .",
    "this method , called `` snowballing '' , is described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : sfe ] shows the bound fractions measured at 2 crossing times and after 20  myr for clusters with different sfe for simulations with a parent clump with @xmath1 and @xmath94 .",
    "the initially positive radial gradient of velocity dispersion of the star clusters causes stars in the outer parts to leave first , while the central core can remain bound .",
    "the mass fraction of this remnant bound core depends on the initial global sfe .",
    "later dynamical evolution and internal mass loss of its members due to stellar evolution leads to a slower decrease in mass of the bound core over time .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig : sfe ] are those for the fiducial case , i.e. , with @xmath48 . as discussed in  [ sec : qi ] , the initial virial ratio of the star clusters depends sensitively on this value : a higher value of @xmath71 shifts the trend shown in this figure upwards so that even clusters with @xmath95 may retain a significant bound core if @xmath71 is sufficiently high .              here",
    "we explore the evolution of the structure of the clusters with time .",
    "the fiducial case has sfe of 50% and @xmath96 , slightly above the criterion for global boundedness .",
    "therefore , initial expansion and some initial mass loss is expected .",
    "we show the evolution of the lagrangian radii with time in figures [ fig : lrad ] and [ fig : lradss1 ] for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , where the values presented are the average of the 20 simulations performed for each set . in each figure",
    ", the top four panels , ( a ) to ( d ) , show the effects of gradually adding greater degrees of realism to make the fiducial model .",
    "then the lower four panels show the effects of different choices of initial binary properties and degree of initial mass segregation .",
    "these figures also show the evolution of the core radius @xmath97 ( red dashed line ) , which is the density averaged distance from the density center of the cluster ( see  15.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "as expected , the clusters expand with time .",
    "the expansion rate of the outer lagrangian radii of the clusters , i.e. , of the unbound stars , is determined by the initial velocity dispersion of the parent clump , which is higher at higher mass surface densities .",
    "thus star clusters starting from a clump with @xmath98 are soon more extended than the clusters forming from clumps with @xmath99 of the same mass and sfe , i.e. , the half - mass radius at 20  myr of the first group is @xmath100pc compared to @xmath101pc for the lower @xmath6 case .",
    "initial expansion of the bound portion of the cluster happens early within a few crossing times as the clusters relax to a virialized state .",
    "then the later evolution is affected by dynamical interactions between the stars ( i.e. , mass segregation , evolution of binaries and dynamical ejection of stars from unstable multiple systems ) and mass loss resulting from stellar evolution .",
    "the relative importance of these effects can be gauged by examining the sequence of panels from ( a ) to ( d ) in figures [ fig : lrad ] and [ fig : lradss1 ] .",
    "the later stage expansion of the bound cluster is negligible in the case of equal mass stars .",
    "the model with an imf but only single stars undergoes mass segregation that leads to noticeable expansion after about 6 myr in the case of @xmath102 and after about 1  myr in the case of @xmath103 .",
    "note that before adding binaries and stellar evolution in our models , evolution of the star clusters with high @xmath3 would be exactly the same as those with low @xmath3 after properly scaling for the initial size and crossing time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the characteristic timescales introduced by binaries ( e.g. , at their typical orbital separation ) and by stellar evolution break this self - similarity .",
    "when binaries are added , their presence leads to another potential source of expansion , since their binding energy couples with the internal energy of the stellar cluster , leading to a change of kinetic energy in each interaction @xcite .",
    "however little difference appears when moving from single stars to 50% binaries , even in simulations with the high @xmath6 initial condition that can suffer more interactions . as we will see in",
    " [ sec : binaries ] , the initial densities of these models are not high enough and/or do not last long enough to give binaries , on average , the chance to interact significantly with other stars .",
    "the inclusion of stellar evolution causes the cluster to expand even more .",
    "stellar evolution starts becoming important after a few myr , when the first massive stars lose mass by stellar winds and then explode as supernovae .",
    "the supernova explosions may cause stars to be ejected ( e.g. , as fast runaway stars ) either by the destruction of tight binaries , velocity kicks caused by the asymmetrical explosion , or both combined effects ( see the outer two lines in figures [ fig : lrad ] and [ fig : lradss1 ] ) .",
    "we focus on the ejection of runaway stars below in  [ sec : ejections ] .",
    "for now we see that cluster expansion is increased by this effect and also by the fact that the potential well of the cluster is made more shallow with the loss of mass through stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "however , the loss of runaway stars does not affect the global evolution of the cluster too much , even in the most extreme case with @xmath67 .",
    "finally , the lower four panels in these figures show that variations of binary orbital properties , degree of initial mass segregation or primordial binary fractions have relatively minor effects .        in figure",

    "we find in our simulations that the mean escape velocity of the bound cluster varies from @xmath162 to 0.6 km / s over the course of the simulation .",

    "another factor is the central star to gas mass ratio at the onset of gas expulsion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this may indicate that some aspect of the model needs to be modified , such as the assumption of instantaneous star formation and gas expulsion .",
    "another feature of our work has been the full treatment of binaries , given assumed primordial binary properties .",
    "the processing of these binaries during the early phases of the dynamical evolution of star clusters can be a diagnostic of the process , i.e. , by comparing their properties with observed field star and embedded cluster binary properties .",
    "we have also seen that binaries affect some aspects of the dynamical evolution of the cluster , in particular by enhancing the rate of dynamical ejection of stars .",
    "we consider that our main results on this topic so far are to show the relative importance of binaries in our model clusters depending on their input assumptions . in the clusters that we have investigated in this paper",
    "there has been relatively little processing of the average initial binary properties given the fairly rapid expansion of the clusters from their initial dynamical states .",
    "these results provide a baseline for comparison of future models of gradual star cluster formation .",
    "since we have a full treatment of binaries and stellar evolution , we are also able to make predictions for the properties of ejected stars , including via dynamical ejection from unstable triples and higher order multiples and from supernova explosions .",
    "the models presented here are only able to reproduce high velocity runaway stars by supernovae kicks .",
    "only the densest initial conditions lead to dynamical ejection of stars at speeds @xmath179 ( but less than one per cluster ) and we have not obtained dynamical ejection of any massive stars at speeds @xmath180 . this probably again indicates a need for more gradual models of star formation that retain a dense cluster core for a larger number of crossing times .    in the context of our presented models that apply in the limit of fast , i.e. , `` instantaneous , '' star cluster formation ,",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "magnetic fields that partially support the parent clump against collapse are a key factor that determines the initial velocity and bound mass of the new born cluster .",
    "star clusters born from clumps with no magnetic field support would need very high sfe ( @xmath181 ) to retain a significant part of the stellar mass after gas is expelled .",
    "regardless of the different initial surface densities , the mass of the bound cluster that emerges from its natal gas is determined by the sfe .",
    "however , the expansion rate of the unbound stellar population is determined by the typical internal velocity of the parent clump .",
    "this means that clusters born in high mass surface density environments will produce unbound populations that expand more rapidly than those produced from clusters formed in low mass surface density environments .",
    "the rapid early expansion of the bound clusters imply that at least @xmath182 higher mass surface density starless clumps are needed to explain observed young ( @xmath183  myr old ) clusters that have stellar mass surface densities @xmath184 , but there is limited evidence for such clumps .",
    "this may indicate a need for more gradual models of star cluster formation .",
    "the low interaction rates of binaries in our simulated clusters lead to only minor modifications of average initial binary properties .",
    "if star cluster formation is rapid , then the present day observed binary properties have not changed much from their primordial distributions , except for those effects induced by stellar evolution .",
    "5 .   based on velocity - position diagrams , it is possible to distinguish the bound cluster from the unbound stars and we expect that this is made easier if gas is expelled quickly .",
    "such diagrams also give us information on the initial properties of the parent clump , such as the initial escape velocity from the cluster .",
    "high velocity runaway stars in the clusters simulated so far are mostly due to supernova explosions that disrupt binaries .",
    "such statistics likely indicate , again , that star cluster formation does not proceed in such a rapid manner .",
    "+    it remains to be determined how the above metrics will vary for models of star clusters forming from turbulent clumps that involve gradual formation of stars and gradual gas expulsion . in addition , correlated spatial and kinematic substructures associated with turbulence and potential infalling accretion flows need to be incorporated into these models .",
    "variations in global geometry , e.g. , elongation of the clump into more filamentary configurations , also need to be explored .",
    "a wider range of initial conditions of clump properties and assumed star formation efficiencies , primordial mass segregation and primordial binary properties need to be investigated for this model family . by an eventual comparison of model results with observed kinematic properties of young clusters ,",
    "we hope to constrain star and star cluster formation theories .",
    "we thank nicola da rio and antonio ordoez for helpful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge support from hubble space telescope cycle 23 theory grant 14317 , _ the orion experiment _",

    "<S> clusters formed from higher @xmath3 environments tend to expand more quickly , so are soon larger than clusters born from lower @xmath3 conditions . to form a young cluster of a given age , stellar mass and mass surface density , these models need to assume a parent molecular clump that is many times denser , which is unrealistic compared to observed systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that in these models the initial binary properties are only slightly modified by interactions , meaning that binary properties , e.g. , at 20  myr , are very similar to those at birth . with this study we set up the basis of future work where we will investigate more realistic models of star formation compared to this instantaneous , baseline case . </S>"
