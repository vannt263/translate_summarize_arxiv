    "direct @xmath0 violating asymmetries in @xmath24 decays occur through the interference of , at least , two amplitudes with different weak phase , @xmath25 , and strong phase , @xmath26 .",
    "the extraction of the weak phase @xmath25 ( which is determined by a combination of ckm matrix elements ) is made through the measurement of a @xmath0 violating asymmetry .",
    "however , one must know the strong phase @xmath26 which is not still well determined in any theoretical framework . in this regard , the isospin symmetry violating mixing between @xmath27 and @xmath10 can be extremely important , since it can lead to a large @xmath0 violation in @xmath24 decays such as @xmath28 ( @xmath29 represents a meson ) because the strong phase passes through @xmath30 at the @xmath10 resonance . in any phenomenological treatment of the weak decays of hadrons ,",
    "the starting point is the weak effective hamiltonian at low energy .",
    "it is obtained by integrating out the heavy fields from the standard model lagrangian .",
    "the operator product expansion is used to separate the calculation of the amplitude , @xmath31 , into two distinct physical regimes .",
    "one is called _ hard _ , represented by @xmath32 and calculated by a perturbative approach . the other",
    "is called _ soft _ , described by @xmath33 and derived by using a non - perturbative approach .",
    "the operators , @xmath33 , can be understood as local operators which govern effectively a given decay , reproducing the weak interaction of quarks in a point - like approximation .",
    "the wilson coefficients , @xmath32 , represent the physical contributions from scales higher than @xmath34 and they can be calculated in perturbation theory because of the property of asymptotic freedom of qcd .",
    "factorization in @xmath24 decays involves three fundamental scales : the weak interaction scale , @xmath35 , the @xmath36 quark mass scale , @xmath37 , and the strong interaction scale , @xmath38 .",
    "the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) approach , based on the concept of color transparency as well as on a soft collinear factorization where the particle energies are bigger than the scale @xmath38 , allows us to write down the matrix elements @xmath39 at the leading order in @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the hadronic decay amplitude involves both soft and hard contributions . at leading order ,",
    "all the non - perturbative effects are assumed to be contained in the semi - leptonic form factors and the light cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "then , non - factorizable interactions are dominated by hard gluon exchanges and can be calculated perturbatively , in order to correct the naive factorization ( nf ) approximation .",
    "it has been also shown that the weak annihilation contributions can not be neglected in @xmath24 meson decays even though they are power suppressed in the heavy - quark limit ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "their contributions are approximated in terms of convolutions of hard scattering kernels with light cone expansions for the final state mesons .",
    "finally , the perturbative calculation of the hard scattering spectator and annihilation contributions is regulated by a physical scale of order @xmath38 .",
    "the direct @xmath0 violating asymmetry parameter , @xmath1 , is found to be small for most of the non - leptonic @xmath24 decays when either the naive or qcd factorization framework is applied .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath24 decay channels involving the @xmath42 meson , it appears that the asymmetry may be large in the vicinity of @xmath10 meson mass .",
    "we stress that @xmath4 mixing has the dual advantages that the strong phase difference is large ( passing rapidly through @xmath30 at the @xmath10 resonance ) and well known . in the vector meson dominance model ,",
    "the photon propagator is dressed by coupling to the vector mesons @xmath42 and @xmath10 . in this regard , the @xmath4 mixing",
    "mechanism has been developed .",
    "knowing the ratio , @xmath43 , between the tree and penguin amplitudes , and the strong phase , @xmath26 , as well as the weak phase , @xmath25 , from the ckm matrix , it is possible to calculate the @xmath0 violating asymmetry , @xmath1 , including the @xmath44 mixing mechanism .",
    "more detail for all the results presented here can be found in ref .",
    "in fig .  [ fig14 ] , we show the @xmath0 violating asymmetry for @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , as a function of the energy , @xmath48 , of the two pions coming from @xmath42 decay , the form factor , @xmath49 , and the ckm matrix element parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for comparison , on the same plot",
    "we show the @xmath0 violating asymmetries , @xmath1 , when nf is applied as well as qcdf where default values for the phases , @xmath52 , and parameters , @xmath53 are used . in the latter case",
    ", we take @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all the particles .",
    "focusing first on fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , where the asymmetry for @xmath46 is plotted , we observe that the @xmath0 violating asymmetry parameter , @xmath1 , can be large outside the region where the invariant mass of the @xmath56 pair is in the vicinity of the @xmath10 resonance .",
    "this is the first consequence of qcd factorization , since within this framework , the strong phase can be generated not only by the @xmath4 mechanism but also by the wilson coefficients . because of the strong phase that is either at the order of @xmath57 or power suppressed by @xmath40 , the @xmath0 violating asymmetry , @xmath1 , may be small but a large asymmetry can not be excluded . at the @xmath10 resonance , the asymmetry parameter , @xmath1 , for @xmath58 , is around @xmath59 in our case . in comparison ,",
    "the asymmetry parameter , @xmath1 , ( still at the @xmath10 resonance ) obtained by applying the naive factorization gives @xmath60 whereas it gives @xmath61 in case of qcdf with default values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the results are quite different between these approaches because of the strong phase mentioned previously .    on the same figure ,",
    "the asymmetry violating parameter , @xmath1 , is shown for the decay @xmath62 . in the vicinity of the @xmath10 resonance ,",
    "the qcdf approach gives an asymmetry of the order @xmath63 .",
    "we obtain @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the case of nf and qcdf with the default values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it appears as well that the asymmetry depends strongly on the ckm matrix parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as expected .",
    "when qcdf is applied , the asymmetry for the decay @xmath58 , varies from @xmath66 to @xmath67 outside the region of the @xmath10 resonance whereas for the decay @xmath68 , the asymmetry varies from @xmath69 down to @xmath64 , depending on the ckm matrix element parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in the vicinity of the @xmath10 resonance ,",
    "the asymmetry , @xmath1 , takes values from @xmath61 to @xmath67 for @xmath58 and from @xmath67 to @xmath70 for @xmath62 when @xmath50 and @xmath51 vary . for the decay @xmath71 , the asymmetry , @xmath1 , in the vicinity of the @xmath10 resonance , is about @xmath72 with qcdf , @xmath73 with nf and @xmath74 with qcdf and default values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for the decay @xmath75 , when @xmath48 is near the @xmath10 resonance , the asymmetry",
    ", @xmath1 is about @xmath76 with qcdf , @xmath77 with nf and @xmath78 with qcdf and usual default values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "there is no agreement , for the value of the asymmetry between the naive and qcd factorization at the @xmath10 resonance except that , in both cases , the @xmath0 violating asymmetry , @xmath1 reaches its maximum in the vicinity of @xmath10 .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn to that of previous case regarding the sensitivity of the asymmetry parameter , @xmath1 , as well as the ckm matrix element parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we included @xmath4 mixing in order to investigate its effect on this @xmath0 violating asymmetry .",
    "the mixing through isospin violation between @xmath10 and @xmath42 , allows us to obtain a difference of the strong phase reaching its maximum at the @xmath10 resonance .",
    "@xmath4 mixing provides an opportunity to remove the phase uncertainty mod@xmath11 in the determination of two ckm angles , @xmath12 in the case of @xmath79 and @xmath14 in the case of @xmath80 .",
    "this phase uncertainty usually arises from the conventional determination of @xmath81 or @xmath82 in indirect @xmath0 violation . in qcdf ,",
    "the strong phase can be generated dynamically , however , the mechanism suffers from end - point singularities which are not well controlled .",
    "it is now apparent that the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix is the dominant source of @xmath0 violation in flavour changing processes in @xmath24 decays .",
    "the corrections to this dominant source coming from beyond the standard model are not expected to be large .",
    "in fact , the main remaining uncertainty is to deal with the procedure of factorization .",
    "the qcdf gives us an explicit picture of factorization in the heavy quark limit .",
    "it takes into account all the leading contributions as well as subleading corrections to the naive factorization .",
    "the soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) has been proposed as a new procedure for factorization . in the last case",
    ", it allows one to formulate a collinear factorization theorem in terms of effective operators where new effective degrees of freedom are involved , in order to take into account the collinear , soft and ultrasoft quarks and gluons .",
    "all of these investigations allow us to increase our knowledge of @xmath24 physics and to look for new physics beyond the standard model .     violating asymmetry , @xmath1 , for @xmath83 for max ckm matrix elements .",
