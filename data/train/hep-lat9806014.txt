    "lattice qcd simulations have always been limited by the requirement that the lattice be large compared with the correlation lengths ( in particular with the pion compton wavelength ) of the theory , while the lattice spacing be small enough for physical observables to exhibit the scaling properties dictated by asymptotic freedom .",
    "in addition the symmetries of the lattice theory should approximate the continuum lorentz and flavour symmetries . with the standard action this requires a lattice with a large number of sites .",
    "for this reason there has been considerable effort to find improved actions which obtain the desired results with appreciably larger lattice spacings .",
    "two methods have emerged for producing such improved actions .",
    "( for a recent summary of such methods and a more complete set of references see @xcite . ) in the first method , the action is improved in powers of the lattice spacing @xmath1 , by adding higher dimensional operators @xcite .",
    "the coefficients can be calculated perturbatively @xcite or non - perturbatively @xcite .",
    "the second method uses renormalization group analyses to determine the fixed point , `` perfect '' action @xcite ( this paper references to the earlier literature ) . for the pure gauge sector of lattice",
    "qcd , actions of the lscher - weisz form @xcite and truncated perfect actions @xcite work very well . for the fermion part of the action , sheikholeslami and wohlert",
    "have identified the operators which contribute at low orders in @xmath1 @xcite . for wilson fermions both methods based on expansions in @xmath1 and on perfect actions",
    "have had considerable success with lattice spacings as large as @xmath2  fm @xcite .    for staggered fermions ,",
    "the improvement of the action in powers of @xmath1 was discussed by naik @xcite .",
    "more recently luo has enumerated all operators which contribute at low orders in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "perfect action methods have also been applied to staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "while simple actions of both these classes show improvements over the standard action , they do not significantly reduce the flavour symmetry violations in the pion spectrum @xcite .",
    "these flavour symmetry violations are a major part of the reason one is forced to use small lattice spacings when using staggered fermions .",
    "the reason why these simple improvements to the staggered quark action fail to make significant improvements to the flavour symmetry , is that they concentrate on making the fermion dispersion relations near the corners of the brillouin zone ( where the components of the fermion momentum are close to @xmath3 or @xmath4 in lattice units ) more continuum - like , and the interactions of these fermions with low momentum gauge fields also more continuum - like .",
    "however , the reason for the flavour symmetry violations in the staggered fermion method is that the gauge fields can transfer momenta large enough to take the quark from the neighbourhood of one corner of the brillouin zone to the vicinity of another , which changes that quark s flavour .",
    "such large momentum transfers are not suppressed by these simple improved actions , and so flavour symmetry violations are not significantly suppressed .",
    "recently , the milc collaboration introduced an new staggered fermion action in which the gauge link is replaced by the linear combination of a single gauge link and the sum over the six 3-link `` staples '' joining the same sites @xcite .",
    "such a replacement tends to smooth the interaction between the gauge and fermion fields , thus reducing the coupling of the high - momentum components of the gauge fields to the quarks .",
    "not surprisingly this action significantly decreases the flavour symmetry violation in the pion spectrum .",
    "we have examined how to systematically suppress such flavour symmetry violations . at tree level , this leads to an action which reduces the flavour symmetry breaking by an extra power of @xmath5 .",
    "we then assume that a good choice of action beyond tree level will have the same form , but with different coefficients .",
    "the milc action is then seen to be a special case of this more general class of actions .    we have compared the spectrum of light hadrons , with particular emphasis on the pions , obtained with the standard staggered quark action , the milc action , and a subset of our new actions . for a preliminary search of the parameter space for these actions we calculated the spectrum of light hadrons on a set of quenched gauge configurations at @xmath6 on an @xmath7 lattice .",
    "a summary of these results was presented at lattice97 @xcite .",
    "we have since calculated the spectrum of light hadrons for the standard action , a near optimal milc action and a promising choice from our new actions on quenched gauge configurations with @xmath6 on a @xmath8 lattice . from these calculations",
    "we conclude that , for an appropriate choice of parameters , our new class of actions represents a significant improvement over the milc action , and confirm that both actions represent a considerable improvement over the standard staggered action .    in section 2 we describe how to systematically reduce flavour symmetry breaking at tree level for lattice qcd at weak coupling , and",
    "introduce our new class of improved actions based on this analysis .",
    "in section 3 we present our measurements of the hadron spectrum on quenched configurations .",
    "section 4 gives our summary and conclusions .",
    "in the staggered fermion transcription of quarks to the lattice , the quark field on site n of the lattice , @xmath9 , is a 3 component object  a colour triplet .",
    "it lacks dirac or flavour indices .",
    "the 4 flavours and 4 dirac components are associated with the 16 poles ( per colour ) of the free lattice dirac propagator . for massless quarks ,",
    "these occur when each component of the momentum @xmath10 or @xmath4 .",
    "since interactions , in general , change the momenta of the quarks , they induce mixings between the degrees of freedom associated with different flavours and hence break flavour symmetry .    at tree level",
    ", one can suppress flavour mixing to higher order in @xmath1 , if one suppresses the coupling of fermions to gluons whose momentum components are all either @xmath3 or @xmath4 but not all @xmath3 . to see how this might be done ,",
    "let us for the moment ignore the requirements of gauge invariance .",
    "then the quark gluon coupling term in the lagrangian could be replaced by @xmath11 which again gives mixing between quark flavours .",
    "we now replace @xmath12 in this term by @xmath13 where @xmath14 in momentum space this is equivalent to the substitution @xmath15 the right hand side of this equation @xmath16 as @xmath17 and differs from @xmath18 by a factor of only @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "it vanishes when any component of @xmath21 equals @xmath4 and is suppressed by a factor of @xmath22 when any component of @xmath21 is within @xmath23 of @xmath4 .",
    "hence this modification of the action would suppress the tree level flavour symmetry violations by @xmath22 , which is what we want for our improved action .",
    "we now return to the gauge invariant theory .",
    "the quark - gluon coupling term in the lagrangian is now @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "our ansatz for a tree - level improved action is obtained by replacing @xmath12 by @xmath26 in equation  [ eqn : naive ] , multiplying out the prefactors , and replacing the products of displacement operators by appropriately symmetrized covariant displacement operators .",
    "this leads to the replacement @xmath27 where @xmath28     + \\sum_{\\nu\\rho } [ \\frac{1}{4 } d_{\\nu\\rho } + \\frac{1}{8 } ( d_{\\mu\\nu\\rho }                                       + d_{-\\mu\\nu\\rho } ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\nu\\rho\\lambda } [ \\frac{1}{8 } d_{\\nu\\rho\\lambda }    + \\frac{1}{16 } ( d_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\lambda}+d_{-\\mu\\nu\\rho\\lambda})]\\ } u_\\mu \\label{eqn : tree}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are summed over @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 all different .",
    "the @xmath40 s are the covariant displacement operators .",
    "for example @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 the operational definition of the @xmath40 s is as follows .",
    "the link is displaced one unit in each of the subscript directions .",
    "the ends of the undisplaced link are joined to the ends of the displaced link by products of links over the shortest paths joining the two .",
    "we then symmetrize over all such paths .",
    "we now must check that this replacement suppresses the quark - gluon interaction when at least one component of the gluon momentum is close to @xmath4 and the rest are near to @xmath3 . since we are interested primarily in what happens to leading order in @xmath1 we can write @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we then evaluate @xmath45 when each component of the momentum @xmath21 of @xmath12 is @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath46 we find @xmath47 . at the other corners of the brillouin zone we find that @xmath45 is longitudinal , and hence decouples , which is the desired result .",
    "to go beyond tree level we assume that we can use a replacement of the same form as the tree replacement , i.e. @xmath48     + \\sum_{\\nu\\rho } [ x_2 d_{\\nu\\rho } + y_2 ( d_{\\mu\\nu\\rho }                                       + d_{-\\mu\\nu\\rho } ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\nu\\rho\\lambda } [ x_3 d_{\\nu\\rho\\lambda }    + y_3 ( d_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\lambda}+d_{-\\mu\\nu\\rho\\lambda})]\\ } u_\\mu \\label{eqn : improved}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 here we could modify the definitions of the displacement operators @xmath40 which include the index @xmath50 to use different weights , depending on the positions of the links in the @xmath50 directions . indeed standard tadpole improvement @xcite would require such changes .",
    "we have chosen not to exercise this option in our choices of improved actions , since even without , this class of action has 6 free parameters .",
    "we note that the milc action belongs to this class , being the special case where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "one of the most visible effects of flavour symmetry violation for staggered quarks is seen in the pion mass spectrum .",
    "only one of the pions is a true goldstone boson whose mass vanishes as the quark mass is taken to zero .",
    "the mass differences between the non - goldstone pions is typically somewhat less than that between them and the goldstone pion . for our measurements ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath54 , the other local pion , as our representative non - goldstone pion . for inverse lattice spacings @xmath55  gev , i.e. for lattice spacings @xmath56  fm , this symmetry breaking is quite large . in the chiral ( @xmath57 )",
    "limit @xmath58 rather than @xmath3 , a @xmath59% effect .",
    "since in the real world , @xmath60 , this is a major impediment to working at such lattice spacings .    for our measurements",
    "we have chosen to work with quenched gauge field configurations at @xmath61 where the inverse lattice spacing is @xmath55  gev . to search the parameter space we performed spectrum calculations on 203 independent quenched configurations generated using the standard ( wilson ) gauge action on an @xmath7 lattice .",
    "hadron spectra were calculated using a single wall source on the @xmath62 sites of the first time slice of each configuration , gauge fixed to coulomb gauge .",
    "the propagators for local hadrons were measured using point sinks .",
    "our measurements used the standard staggered quark action , the milc action and our improved action .",
    "the @xmath4 , @xmath54 , @xmath30 and nucleon masses are given in table  [ tab : mass8 ] .",
    "for the milc action we measured the spectrum for @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 at quark mass @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . from table",
    "[ tab : mass8 ] , we note that the flavour symmetry breaking measured as @xmath69 appears smallest for the @xmath64 measurements , but that the difference between the 3 @xmath70 values is small . from this we conclude that @xmath64 is a close to optimal choice for @xmath61 . for our improved action ,",
    "even with our restricted parameterization , there are 6 independent parameters . to limit our choices , we chose a 1 parameter subclass parameterized by @xmath71 , for which @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this choice was influenced by tadpole improvement .",
    "the results we present here are for the tree level coefficients ( @xmath74 ) with quark masses @xmath66 and @xmath67 , for @xmath75 with quark masses @xmath76 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 and for @xmath77 with quark masses @xmath78 and @xmath76 . here",
    "symmetry breaking appears to be smallest for @xmath75 .",
    "we note also that symmetry breaking for our best improved action is appreciably smaller than for the best milc action .",
    "since the @xmath30 masses are very close , this does not appear to be simply due to differences in the perceived lattice spacing .    .hadron",
    "masses for various choices of the staggered quark action at @xmath61 on an @xmath7 lattice .",
    "standard is the standard staggered action , milc5 , milc1 and milcu are the milc action with @xmath63 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively and naive , imp2 and impu are our improved action with @xmath81 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "[ tab : mass8 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that the goldstone @xmath4 masses show very little finite size effect in going from an @xmath7 to a @xmath8 lattice .",
    "the @xmath54 masses for the milc and improved actions also show relatively little finite size effect while that for the standard action shows considerably more .",
    "however , we note that the errors for the standard action are large , and all the errors in these tables are purely statistical  no estimate of the systematic error associated with choice or appropriateness of fits is included  so that is not clear how significant this is .",
    "similar comments can be made about any apparent finite size effects in the @xmath30 and nucleon masses .",
    "we assume that for a @xmath8 lattice , where the spatial box size is @xmath82  fm at this @xmath83 , the finite size effects will be relatively small .",
    "we refer the reader to recent , more extensive quenched spectrum calculations at @xmath61 for serious finite size studies and masses with which our standard action masses can be compared , and also for chiral extrapolation studies @xcite .",
    "just comparing @xmath69 indicates that both the milc and our improved actions give a considerable reduction in flavour symmetry violation over the standard action . in addition",
    "our improved action gives improvement over that of the milc action . to make this more quantitative ,",
    "we have chirally extrapolated our masses to zero quark mass .",
    "we do this firstly because , since the relationship between the lattice quark mass and the physical ( @xmath84 ) mass is different for each action , and there is the ambiguity as to which observable should be used to determine which lattice quark masses correspond to one another .",
    "@xmath85 is the same for each lattice action .",
    "secondly , the physical @xmath86 and @xmath87 quark masses are small enough that the chiral limit is a good approximation to the real world .",
    "since we have 4 quark masses for each action , we can use a 3-parameter fit for our chiral extrapolation . for the goldstone pion we have chosen to fit to @xmath88 for the second pion @xmath54",
    "we have used a 2-parameter fit @xmath89 our pion masses and these fits are plotted in figure  [ fig : pimass ] . since our goldstone pion masses have been forced to zero in the @xmath85 limit , @xmath90 is a good measure of flavour symmetry violation . from our fits",
    "we obtain @xmath91 for the standard action @xmath92 for the milc action and @xmath93 for our improved action .",
    "these would be valid measures of improvement if we consider that the true lattice spacing is that obtained from some pure gluonic observable such as the string tension , or the @xmath30 mass from some unknown `` correct '' fermion action .",
    "if , however , we follow the milc collaboration , and consider that each fermion action determines its own lattice spacing , we need to extrapolate whatever hadron mass is to be used to determine this spacing to @xmath85 for each action separately . for the @xmath30 and nucleon , we have used a simple linear extrapolation in @xmath94 .",
    "( even though such fits were not great , we were unable to find any 3 parameter fits which did significantly better . )",
    "these fits for our 3 actions are shown in figures  [ fig : rho ] and [ fig : nucleon ] .",
    "this gives @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the standard action , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the milc action and @xmath99 and @xmath100 for our improved action in the chiral limit .",
    "hence if we use the @xmath30 mass to set the scale , we get @xmath101 for the standard action @xmath102 for the milc action and @xmath103 for our improved action .",
    "as discussed by the milc collaboration , one of the effects of improving the quark action is to reduce the lattice spacing as determined by the @xmath30 mass .",
    "( this is evident in our results quoted above . )",
    "before we conclude how successful our program has been , we therefore need to know how much flavour symmetry violation would have been improved merely by making such decreases in lattice spacing , without changing our quark action . to do",
    "this one would need to know how large the standard action flavour symmetry violations would be at a lattice spacings where the @xmath30 mass for the standard action would have the values the milc @xmath30 mass and our improved @xmath30 mass have respectively at @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , we would need to know the size of the milc action flavour symmetry violations at the lattice spacing where the milc @xmath30 mass has the value our improved @xmath30 mass has at @xmath61 .",
    "we do not have this information .",
    "however , we know that the leading flavour symmetry violations should be @xmath22 and the ratios of relevant @xmath1 s are given by the inverse ratios of the corresponding @xmath30 masses .",
    "this would give an estimate of @xmath104 for the standard action at a lattice spacing set by the milc @xmath30 mass , and @xmath105 at a lattice spacing set by our improved @xmath30 mass .",
    "similarly we estimate the flavour symmetry violation for the milc action to be @xmath106 at a lattice spacing set by our improved @xmath30 mass .",
    "we now check this @xmath22 dependence against published results @xcite at higher @xmath83 values , performing the required linear extrapolations as best we can . at @xmath107",
    "the chirally extrapolated @xmath30 mass is @xmath108 from which we predict @xmath109 compared with the value calculated from extrapolated @xmath54 and @xmath30 masses namely @xmath110 . at @xmath111 the chirally extrapolated @xmath30 mass is @xmath112 from which we predict @xmath113 compared with the direct extrapolation @xmath114 .",
    "thus we conclude that our predictions from the assumed @xmath22 dependence will be if anything lower than the actual values .",
    "we have introduced a new class of single - link actions for staggered fermions which reduce the flavour symmetry violations from @xmath22 to @xmath115 at tree level , where @xmath1 is the lattice spacing , by suppressing the coupling of high momentum gluons to quarks which is responsible for flavour mixing . on quenched configurations at @xmath61 where @xmath116  gev , the flavour symmetry violations for local pions are reduced by @xmath117  ",
    "@xmath118% , over those of the standard action and by @xmath119    @xmath120% over those in the milc action . for our improved action",
    "this means that the flavour symmetry violations at @xmath61 are approximately the size of those for the standard action at @xmath121 , i.e. at approximately half the lattice spacing . since all these actions are single link , inverting the dirac operator is no more expensive than with the standard action .",
    "in fact , it is considerably less expensive with the improved actions , since they require many less conjugate gradient iterations to reach the same level of convergence .",
    "for example , at @xmath122 , our improved action required 10001050 conjugate gradient iterations compared with 17001750 for the milc action and 26002700 for the standard action .    of course , although flavour symmetry violations are one of the most important barriers to using staggered quarks at lattice spacings of @xmath123  fm , they are not the only barriers .",
    "our improvements need to be combined with improvements to the free fermion dispersion relations and to the gauge action . in the case of the milc action ,",
    "work of this nature has recently been done by orginos and toussaint @xcite , who have also included dynamical quarks .",
    "the originos - toussaint paper does , however , point out that although their actions improve the @xmath4  ",
    "@xmath54 , mass splitting , the point - split pions do not show as much improvement .",
    "although we have not measured the spectrum of these point - split pions , we expect the improvement to be more uniform across the pion multiplet with our action than with the milc action .",
    "the reason is that at tree level , our action uniformly suppresses all flavour mixings . on the other hand the milc action , at tree level ,",
    "can be adjusted to maximally suppress some flavour mixings , but it will at best only partially suppress the others . however",
    ", only explicit measurement will tell if our expectations are correct .",
    "another aspect of flavour symmetry violation for staggered quarks is the extent to which they fail to obey the atiyah - singer index theorem .",
    "we have shown that the milc action produces only limited improvement in this area @xcite .",
    "it is to be hoped that our improved action might fare better .",
    "a more serious study is needed to determine the optimal parameters in our action .",
    "our action is still far from ideal for treating light @xmath86 and @xmath87 quarks .",
    "a tadpole improved perturbative calculation of the coefficients might be helpful , although perturbative calculations for staggered fermions have proved disappointing in the past .",
    "one might hope that it might be possible to reduce the flavour symmetry violations to @xmath115 as suggested by the tree level calculations , within the restrictions of a single link fermion action .",
    "the analysis of luo @xcite should be helpful in reducing the operators in our action to an independent set .",
    "although it is obvious that we need to reduce the coupling of high momentum gluons to staggered quarks , to reduce flavour symmetry violations , it is also important to reduce such coupling for wilson quarks . in the case of wilson",
    "quarks this is to decrease chiral symmetry violations .",
    "this has been addressed most recently by degrand @xcite who introduced smeared link fields into wilson fermions calculations .",
    "such smearing could also be useful in reducing effects of small instantons on wilson fermions which have the potential for creating problems if they are to be used as the basis for domain - wall fermions @xcite .",
