    "hibschmann & arons ( 2001 ) ( hereafer ha ) have shown that the pa curve also undergoes vertical shifts , ie .  in the pa values .",
    "both these results appear to have interesting observational consequences ( eg .  ramachandran & kramer 2003 ; von hoensbroech & xilouris 1997 ) .    in the case of phase - dependent emission altitude",

    "the derivation presented here is constrained to the case of the equatorial plane of an orthogonally rotating pulsar ( with dipole inclination @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , it is simple , intuitive and demonstrates the effect more directly than the original derivation of bcw .",
    "because of their corotation , trajectories of electrons are bent forward ( toward the direction of rotation ) in the inertial observer frame ( iof ) with respect to trajectories in the corotating frame ( cf ) .",
    "the trajectory of electrons that move along the dipole axis acquires some forward curvature , whereas the rectilinear motion occurs somewhere on the trailing side of the dipole axis .",
    "the bundle of iof - trajectories becomes approximately symmetric around the location of this straight trajectory , which now assumes the role that the dipole axis had in the rc69 model ( rvm model ) .",
    "this zero - curvature trajectory is associated with the inflection point of the pa curve .",
    "its location can be found in the following two steps .",
    "first , we calculate ` rotationally - induced curvature ' , which is understood as the curvature imposed by rotation on a trajectory that is a straight line in the cf .",
    "second , we will search for a place on the trailing side of the dipole axis , where this rotational curvature is exactly cancelled by the same - magnitude backward curvature of dipolar magnetic field lines .",
    "relativistic electrons ( with the speed of essentially constant magnitude @xmath7 ) that move radially along the dipole axis in the frame rotating with the neutron star s angular velocity @xmath8 , undergo acceleration @xmath9 in the iof .",
    "this result can be obtained in several elementary ways ( see the exercise in appendix [ ladyb ] ) .",
    "the particle trajectory along the dipole axis thus acquires radius of curvature @xmath10 which is : @xmath11 the index ` rt ' is to remind that this is the curvature induced by rotation on electron _ trajectory _ that is _ radial _ ( or almost radial ) in the corotating frame . near the dipole axis ,",
    "the curvature radius of dipolar field lines is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radial distance of an emission point and @xmath14 is the angle between @xmath15 and the dipole axis .",
    "we look for regions in the trailing part of the polar cap tube , where the rotationally - induced curvature of eq .",
    "is cancelled by the curvature of b - field lines . by equating @xmath16 with",
    "@xmath17 one can find an equation for the locations of straight portions of the trajectories : @xmath18 where the index ` zc ' stands for ` zero curvature ' .",
    "we can see that the locations of the zero - curvature depend on radial distance : @xmath19 . in the dipole geometry , magnetic field lines at points with coordinate @xmath14 are directed at angle @xmath20 with respect to the magnetic axis.therefore , the phase delay of emission from the zero - curvature regions with respect to the ( same altitude ) emission along dipole axis is equal to @xmath21 thus , the locally - straight portions of electron trajectory lag the dipole axis spatially by @xmath22 , whereas the tangent - to-@xmath23 directions of radio waves emitted from these regions lag the direction of waves emitted along the dipole axis by the angle of @xmath0 radians .",
    "note that until the very end of the derivation there was no need to explicitly refer to the effects of aberration and propagation time delays ( apt ) that noticeably increase complexity of more general analysis ( see appendix [ abret ] for the definition of the apt effects ) .",
    "this is because it is the rotational straightening of electron trajectories that is the essence of the effect .",
    "as long as one is interested in emission from a fixed altitude , _ both _ the aberration _ and _ propagation time effects can be ignored , because the waves emitted along the dipole axis as well as those emitted from the zero - curvature regions are advanced in ( absolute ) phase by roughly the same magnitude ( @xmath24 by aberration and another @xmath24 by propagation time ) .",
    "it is so because in the small angle approximation all the open field lines are basically orthogonal to the corotation velocity ( for details see dyks , rudak & harding 2004b , hereafter drh ) .",
    "the apt effects only have to be included when there are altitude differences , or when one wants to know the magnitude of absolute delays with respect to the  fiducial phase \" .",
    "this subject will be discussed in detail in the next section .    according to eq .",
    "( [ zerocurv ] ) , the last open field lines , located near @xmath25 , have the zero - curvature in iof at radial distance @xmath26 note , however , that at this altitude the inaccuracy of our approximation ( linear in @xmath24 ) is _ not _ negligible ( it is of the order of @xmath27 )",
    ".    we can also determine the rotation period @xmath28 for which the zero curvature occurs at the trailing part of the rim of the polar cap .",
    "since @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 in seconds , one obtains : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the neutron star radius .",
    "thus , it happens just in the fastest known millisecond pulsars ( j17148@xmath342446 with @xmath35 ms , hessels et al .",
    "2006 , or b1937@xmath121 with @xmath36 ms , backer et al .",
    "1982 ) that the ` dipole axis ' is shifted full way to the trailing rim of the polar cap ( provided the pulsars have @xmath37 , as their interpulses suggest ) .",
    "the effect is illustrated in fig .  1 of dyks & rudak ( 2002 ) , where a numerically calculated trajectory of photons in the cf ( for @xmath38 ms and @xmath6 ) neatly coincides with the last open field line that emerges from the trailing side of the polar cap .",
    "another consequence is that the efficiency of magnetic pair production in these objects is the weakest near the trailing side of the polar cap , not at the polar cap center ( see fig .",
    "7 in the last - mentioned paper ) .",
    "in the absence of the rotational effects the pa as a function of phase is given by : @xmath39 + { \\psi_{{\\scriptscriptstyle}\\omega } } , \\label{orig}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the pulse phase with zero point defined arbitrarily by the observer , @xmath40 is the pulse phase at which the line of sight lies within the @xmath41 plane , the constant @xmath42 is the position angle of the projection of the pulsar rotation axis on the plane of the sky , @xmath43 is the angle between the angular velocity of pulsar rotation @xmath8 and the dipole magnetic moment @xmath44 , whereas @xmath45 is the angle between @xmath8 and the unit vector of the line of sight @xmath46 .",

    "the strict symmetry of the open volume with respect to the @xmath41-plane is unlikely , and it has been shown ( dyks & harding 2004 , hereafter dh04 ) that even very small effects ( that at low altitudes are of high order in @xmath24 ) can easily introduce large asymmetry . here",
    "i discuss the rotational deformations of the vacuum dipole ( dh04 ; shitov 1983 , deutsch 1955 ) , because they are easy to analyze ( thanks to the existing analytical formulae ) and they seem to be qualitatively similar to those obtained in recent plasma - loaded simulations ( eg .  spitkovsky 2008 ) .",
    "as we show in detail in dh04 , in the lowest order ( of @xmath164 , which is already higher than the @xmath24 accuracy of equations in the preceding sections ) the rotational sweepback does not introduce any asymmetry to the @xmath23-field direction .",
    "the asymmetric change of @xmath73-field direction is of the order of @xmath165 at low altitudes ( completely negligible _ there _ ) . despite this",
    ", a very strong asymmetry of the open volume ( of magnitude @xmath166 ) is generated by the sweepback .",
    "this is because the low - altitude outer boundary of the open volume is determined by the geometry of @xmath73 _ at the light cylinder _",
    ", where the sweepback becomes a strong effect ( first order , in the sense that there we have @xmath167 , regardless of @xmath168 ) .",
    "this strong distortion is traced back towards low altitudes through the continuity of magnetic field lines , and results in strong ( much stronger than @xmath165 ) asymmetry of the open volume .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by replacing the delay - radius relation ( eq .",
    "[ bcw ] ) with the ` misalignment ' formula of dh04 : @xmath169 where @xmath170 depends on @xmath43 and @xmath45 and has typically the magnitude of @xmath171 .",
    "eq .   differs from the original delay - radius relation only in that it takes into account the azimuthal asymmetry of the outer boundary of the open field line region .",
    "however , i do not refer to eq .",
    "( [ misal ] ) with the name ` delay - radius ' relation because the shift of position angle curve does not have to be the positive delay anymore  it can now _ slightly _ precede the profile midpoint , see dh04 for more details .",
    "those , who believe that the _ rotating _ vacuum dipole is a better approximation of the real @xmath73 than the static vacuum dipole should use eq .",
    "( [ misal ] ) instead of the original delay - radius relation of bcw .",
    "what may be most reasonable is to use both the eq .   and as the lower and upper limit for @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the current - induced distortions of magnetic field can be easily estimated with a simplification of ampere s law @xmath172 into the crude form of @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the magnetic field generated by the current density @xmath175 , and @xmath176 is the characteristic scale . for longitudinal polar currents of the goldreich - julian ( gj ) magnitude we have @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the gj density , whereas the transverse scale @xmath179 corresponds to the open field line region .",
    "the distortions of @xmath23 are therefore of the order of @xmath180 .",
    "for toroidal currents ( due to the corotation of @xmath181 ) we have @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the local corotation velocity , and @xmath184 .",
    "this results in smaller distortions of @xmath185 .",
    "ha find that the polar currents shift the pa curve downward by @xmath186 .",

    "these should not affect the delay - radius relation , because it refers only to a single @xmath2 , and is insensitive to any time delays ( whether gravitational or flat spacetime ) .",
    "they do affect , however , all formulae which refer to altitude differences ( as do all the equations that explicitly involve both @xmath2 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "let us then use the schwarzschild metric to learn when the shapiro delay can not be neglected .",
    "the time for a ray to travel radially in the gravitational field from some @xmath193 up to @xmath194 is @xmath195 where @xmath196 . instead of that",
    ", our flat spacetime formulae assume the time is the rmer delay @xmath197 , so they miss the fact that the low altitude emission components ( emitted at @xmath193 ) are additionally shapiro - delayed by @xmath198 with respect to the high - altitude emission components emitted at @xmath194 .",
    "in the case of millisecond pulsars ( mps ) this effect can become easily measurable : for @xmath199 cm , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 ms , we obtain @xmath202 s which corresponds to the phase shift of @xmath203 . for the same @xmath193 and @xmath204 but for @xmath38 ms",
    "the phase shift is @xmath205 .",
    "it become slightly smaller because for the fixed @xmath206 the altitude difference decreased ( for @xmath201 ms @xmath4 is @xmath207 cm , whereas for @xmath38 s",
    "it is twice smaller ) .",
    "note that in the estimate i take @xmath208 as a blind guess of the upper limit for radio emission regions in millisecond pulsars .",
    "this is simply because the known estimates or radio emission altitudes for classical pulsars ( a few tens of @xmath209 , drh ; gupta & gangadhara 2003 ; kijak & gil 1997 ) would locate the emission region beyond the light cylinder in the millisecond pulsars .",
    "if one takes @xmath210 , the gravitational phase shifts become @xmath211 and @xmath212 for @xmath201 and @xmath97 ms , respectively .",

    "another reason for not applying the approximate theory to the mps is that it is very inaccurate for altitude differences of @xmath213 , which are likely in fast mps even if the radio emission extends radially by only one @xmath209 . to calculate the phase shifts for mps even more accurately",

    "the phase shifts typically have a few hundredths of a degree .",
    "the relativistic phase shifts are of the order of @xmath24 , whereas the lowest - order terms that have been neglected in derivation of eqs .",
    " have magnitude of @xmath216 .",
    "this means that the analytical approximations for the polarization angle have a fractional error of @xmath217 percent , which is as large as @xmath218% already at @xmath219 .",
    "the approximate equations  are compared to the exact numerical pa curves in fig .",

    "the numerical pa curves were calculated for fixed emission altitudes ( shown in bottom right corners ) and only involve the kinematic effects of corotation ( the method of calculation is described in sect .  2 of dyks et al .",
    "it is seen that for any @xmath220 there are considerable differences between the exact result ( dots ) and the approximate formulae .",
    "one can also see that at large altitudes the approximate formula of bcw ( eq .  [ psir1 ] , thin solid lines ) performs much better than the appropriately shifted classic equation of komesaroff ( eqs .",
    "[ psir2 ] and [ psir ] , dashed lines ) .",
    "an interesting effect seen in fig .",
    "[ pacurves ] is that for large altitudes the numerical pa curves strongly tend to assume the distorted - sine - like ( ` equatorward ' ) shape , in spite of that the figure is for the poleward viewing geometry ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath45 with the equatorward pa shape is not limited to the range @xmath221 and is instead increasing with altitude .",
    "for the specific case shown in fig .",
    "[ pacurves ] the numerically determined range of the equatorward pa curve is @xmath222 for @xmath223 , and @xmath224 for @xmath225 ( with numerically - limited accuracy of @xmath226 ) .",
    "the bcw equation for the pa ( eq .  [ psir1 ] ) does reproduce this behaviour ( to some limited degree ) , but the fixed - shape pa curve of the ` relativistically shifted ' rc69 model ( eq .  [ psir2 ] or [ psir ] ) fails to do this , which results in the large disagreement already visible in panel c of fig .",
    "[ pacurves ] ( for @xmath225 ) .    another interesting effect in fig .",
    "[ pacurves ] can be seen if one compares pa curves of the static - shape dipole to the distorted ( ` retarded ' ) dipole case . at large altitudes ( @xmath227 ) the sine - like pa curves for the distorted dipole ( fig .",
    "[ pacurves]h , i ) move leftward ( toward earlier phases ) and have their steepest gradient point shifted leftward with respect to the fiducial phase ( opposite than expected from the bcw theory ) .",
    "this effect is caused by backward bending of magnetic field lines ( the sweepback ) which shifts the spatial location of  magnetic axis \" ( here i mean a locally straight @xmath73-field line at a given @xmath2 ) foreward , into the leading part of pulsar magnetosphere . at large @xmath2",
    "this effect seems to dominate the straightening of electron trajectories .",
    "the distorted - sine shape of the high - altitude pa curves , with the steepest gradient point well ahead of the ` dipole - axis ' phase , bears close resemblance to the unusual pa curve of the pedestal radio emission of b1929@xmath110 , where the steepest gradient _ precedes _ the main pulse by as much as @xmath228 ( rankin & rathnasree 1997 ; everett & weisberg 2001 ) .",
    "this interpretation would imply that the pedestal radio emission originates from @xmath229 .",
    "however , below i also mention other possible interpretations of this effect .",
    "the radio emission mechanism assumed in the bcw theory is the curvature radiation caused by the ` macroscopic ' acceleration due to the curvature of magnetic field lines .",
    "the acceleration is small enough that the corotation can modify it to produce the delay - radius relation of eq .  .",
    "the operation of the curvature radiation in pulsar magnetosphere is , however , still a matter of debate ( eg .  luo & melrose 1992 ; kunzl et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the other emission processes ( eg .  the direct or inverse - compton - scattered plasma emission , or the synchrotron emission ) typically involve much larger accelerations due to microscopic motions , that are unlikely to be noticeably affected by the corotation ( eg .  the acceleration due to gyration exceeds the macroscopic acceleration due to the corotation by a factor @xmath230 ( \\gamma/10 ^ 3)^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath231 is the gyration frequency , takata et al .  2007 ) .",
    "it is then tempting to speculate that the pa curves for such emission processes would not be delayed by the bcw effect .",
    "but the aberration and propagation time effects would still be there , and would shift the pa curve by @xmath96 toward _ earlier _ phase than the main pulse .",
    "this may be a mechanism responsible for the leftward shift of the pedestal pa in b1929@xmath110 .",
    "in dyks , rudak & rankin ( 2007 ; hereafter drr ) we provide other arguments for non - curvature origin of the pedestal emission . the main pulse emission ,",
    "on the other hand , does not exhibit the abnormal shift which makes it more consistent with the curvature radiation .",
    "the best examples of this phenomenon are provided by the pedestal radio emission of b1929@xmath110 and the weak bridge of radio emission that connects the main pulse and interpulse of b0950@xmath108 .",
    "the pa curves of these extended components ( fitted _ without _ the part under the main pulse , see everett & weisberg 2001 ) have their steepest gradient points well on the leading side of the main pulse .",
    "so far the following mechanisms have been considered for this effect :    1 .   the high - altitude curvature emission from roughly fixed altitude ( sect .",
    "[ accuracy ] in this paper and fig .",
    "[ pacurves]h , i ) .",
    "this probably can not explain the case of b0950@xmath108 , for which the pa curve has the poleward shape .",
    "2 .   radio emission mechanisms different than curvature radiation ( sect .",
    "[ noncurv ] ) .",
    "possibly consistent with the parallel - ics interpretation of double notches ( drr ) .",
    "3 .   inward curvature radiation . proposed simply as an inverted version of the bcw effect ( dyks et al .",
    "the ` pulsar shadow ' model of double notches , that has led to this interpretation , has been superceeded by the model described in drr .",
    "yet another interpretation can be devised using the ` limiting polarization radius ' idea : polarization of the radiation propagating through the inner ( dense ) regions of the pulsar magnetosphere can follow the _ local _ direction of magnetic field ( eg .",
    "cheng & ruderman 1979 ; melrose 1979 ; barnard 1986 ) until the radiation reaches the polarization - limiting radius @xmath232 .",
    "the plasma - density - dependent estimates of @xmath232 are highly uncertain ( eg .  lyubarsky 2002 ) but it should be significantly larger than the radial distance of the emission region .",
    "+ high - up in the pulsar magnetosphere the polar beam of radio emission , emitted at low altitudes , propagates through the _ trailing _ part of open field line region ( see fig .  1 in dyks & rudak 2002 , or fig .  1 in lyubarsky 2002 )",
    "therefore , the polarization imprinted in the beam at @xmath232 reflects the trailing part of the polarization curve , with the steepest gradient point shifted considerably towards early phases .",
    "the same mechanism was proposed by lyubarsky ( 2002 ) to explain the shallowness of pa curves observed in millisecond pulsars ( xilouris et al .",
    "let me emphasize that the parallel - ics model of pedestal emission mentioned in point ( ii ) above , actually _ necessitates _ this propagation - induced linear polarization .",
    "otherwise the observed polarization degree would be very low due to the convolution of many micro - beams contributing to the line of sight .",
    "it is shown in sect .",
    "[ simpderiv ] that the magnitude of the shift given by the delay - radius relation has nothing to do with the aberration ( understood as the normal beaming effect ) .",
    "on the other hand , hibschman & arons mention a phase shift of @xmath95 ( their eq .  4 ) and claim that it is just the aberration (  simple beaming \" ) that is responsible for the remaining @xmath24 part of the total delay .",
    "do we have a contradiction here ?    not really , though the wording of ha can easily be misunderstood . both in the bcw and ha , the delay - radius relation is derived as a difference of two moments of emission : 1 ) the moment when the radiation bearing the steepest - gradient pa is directed to the observer ( this happens at @xmath233 ) and 2 ) an earlier moment when the radiation in the middle of the profile ( emitted in the @xmath41-plane in the cf ) becomes directed toward the observer . ha explicitly notice that the latter does _ not _ take place at the moment @xmath234 , when the dipole axis is in the @xmath8-observer plane : instead , because of the aberration it happens at @xmath235 ( see fig .  [ emigeom ] and eq .",
    "[ phem ] with @xmath236 ) . the key point that is not mentioned in their description",
    ", however , is that the moment @xmath233 at which the steepest gradient radiation is directed toward the observer has already been also advanced in time by the same aberration angle of @xmath24 .",
    "thus , _ the aberration , understood as the normal beaming effect , works identically both at the center of the main pulse , as well as on its trailing side and contributes practically nothing to the shift of the pa curve with respect to the intensity profile . _",
    "another issue related to aberration is mostly nomenclatural . in this paper",
    "i describe the origin of the delay - radius relation as the ` straightening of electron trajectories ' when they are transformed from cf to iof . or",
    ", one can say the effect is due to the transformation of electron acceleration from the non - inertial cf to iof . in the wording of ha the phase shift caused by these effects",
    "is described as ` aberrational ' too ( see eg .  their appendix f and g ) . an argument that can ( possibly ) justify this is eq .",
    "( their eq .",
    "the addition of velocities ( aberration ) given in this equation determines the electron velocity in iof , which is next differentiated to obtain iof acceleration .",
    "of course , what really matters is not the fact that we add the corotation velocity , but the fact that the added velocity is time - dependent ( or that cf is non - inertial ) .",
    "since the phenomenon of aberration by itself refers only to the velocity of a reference - frame , and not to its acceleration , the term ` aberration ' misses the essence of the effect , which is the _ time - dependent nature _ of the corotation velocity in .    a word of comment on papers that have assumed that the pa curve is shifted _ forward _ in phase , just as the intensity profile does ( eg .",
    "kd83 ; xu et al .  1997 ; note that the work of kd83 was published in the pre - bcw era ) .",
    "if one corrects the analysis of kd83 for the direction of the pa shift , the altitude order of their four emission regions ( see .  their fig",
    "16 ) should be turned upside - down , ie .",
    "the region 4 should be at the top , region 3 below 4 , etc .    finally a note related to the high - energy emission .",
    "electrons with lorentz factors @xmath237  @xmath238 that move along the dipole axis trajectory with @xmath239 and @xmath240 s emit curvature radiation that extends up to @xmath241 ",
    "@xmath242 mev , respectively .",
    "this energy is too low for pair production ( see fig .  7 in dyks & rudak 2002 ) .",
    "however , this radiation may contribute to the observed x - rays and gamma - ray pulse profiles and spectra . in the numerical models of the high - energy emission from pulsars",

    "the last term has the magnitude of @xmath246 times the local corotation velocity @xmath270 and it is negligible at low altitudes where @xmath271 .",
    "thus , @xmath272 and @xmath273 .    for @xmath274 ( and @xmath275 ) the two non - zero terms in eq .",
    "[ aa ] ( and therefore @xmath117 ) are smaller by a factor of @xmath276 , so that @xmath16 is larger by @xmath277 .",
    "the zero - curvature regions are located closer to the dipole axis by the @xmath276 factor .",
    "however , the delay - radius relation retains its usual form ( @xmath43-independent ) , because the @xmath276 factor is cancelled by the ` not a great circle ' effect .",

    "( [ rheq ] ) can be found in thomas & gangadgara ( 2005 ) ( see their eq .",
    "the aberration is understood as the change of emission direction of radio waves caused by the transition from the lorentz frame instantaneously comoving with a corotating emission point to the inertial observer frame ( iof ) .",
    "i assume that in the corotating frame ( cf ) the radio waves are emitted in the direction @xmath132 which is tangential to the direction of dipolar magnetic field ( @xmath278 ) .",
    "then , in the iof the emission occurs in the direction : @xmath279\\vec \\beta_{\\rm crt}}{\\gamma_{\\rm crt}(1 + \\vec \\beta_{\\rm crt } \\cdot \\vec k^\\prime ) } , \\label{aberration}\\ ] ] where @xmath280 , and @xmath281 .",
    "is just the general lorentz transformation for an arbitrary velocity vector @xmath266 , in which i substituted @xmath282 and @xmath283 .    for low emission altitudes ( @xmath284 ) and near the dipole axis ( small angle approximation ) eq .",
    "can be considerably simplified because @xmath132 is not far from radial and @xmath285 is small and purely azimuthal .",
    "using the spherical coordinates @xmath286 , with @xmath287-axis along @xmath8 and with the azimuth @xmath288 increasing in the direction of the corotation velocity @xmath289 the aberration formula becomes : @xmath290 which means that in our specific case the aberration basically rotates the emission direction forward in phase by @xmath24 rad , regardless of the emission colatitude ( drh ) .",
    "note that eq",
    ".   refers to the unit vectors of emission direction after they have been parallel - shifted to the origin of the coordinates frame : @xmath291 , @xmath292 .",
    "propagation time delays ( also called ` retardation ' ) refer to the travel time of radio waves within the pulsar magnetosphere : radiation emitted deeper in the magnetosphere will be detected later than the simultaneous emission from high altitudes .",
    "the delays are taken into account through the reference to the center of the neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "let us consider a point located at the radial position @xmath15 at the instant @xmath293 when it is emitting towards an observer . under normal conditions such a point",
    "is located closer to the observer than the ns center .",
    "radiation emitted from this point will therefore be detected _ earlier _ by @xmath294 than an imaginary signal simultaneously emitted from the center of the ns . here",
    "@xmath295 is a projection of @xmath15 ( taken at the instant of emission ) on the observer s line of sight ( defined by the unit vector @xmath46 ) and i assume that the radio waves travel at the speed of light @xmath244 ( dispersion is ignored ) .",
    "note that the propagation time advance / delay is _ not _ independent of aberration : to find @xmath296 at the moment of emission , we first need to know the aberrated emission direction @xmath297 .",
    "however , since the angle between @xmath296 and @xmath46 is small , in the lowest order approximation the propagation time advance simply becomes : @xmath298 and the associated phase advance is @xmath24 , just as in the case of aberration ."
