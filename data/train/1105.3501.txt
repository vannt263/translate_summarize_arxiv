    "the performance of nanoelectronic devices based on atomically thin films such as graphene depends critically on the interplay between geometry , structure and mechanics .",
    "this is especially true in the case of nanoribbons where the edge structure can fundamentally alter the overall response . as a classic example , the band gap in graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) is sensitive to edge type and ribbon width and in extreme cases determines the nature of the electronic transport , metallic or semiconducting  @xcite .",
    "the interplay with ribbon morphology serves as a crucial ingredient in quantifying these structure - property relations as the edge elasticity varies significantly with its structure  @xcite .",
    "the edge shape also determines the nature and extent of edge functionalization  @xcite .",
    "past studies on these ultra - thin ribbons and sheets have revealed several interesting morphologies . in instances where the edge stress is compressive ,",
    "the edges warp out of plane ; shenoy and coworkers used a combination of atomic - scale computations and scaling arguments to calculate the wavelength , amplitude and penetration width of such undulations in semi - infinite edges  @xcite .",
    "independent computations by bets and yakobson show that the rippling wavelength scales with the ratio of the edge stress to the flexural rigidity @xmath0  @xcite . below a critical width , the ripples transition into a spontaneous twist .",
    "the situation is expectedly different for tensile edge stresses , recently observed in reconstructed edges in graphene and intrinsic to bilayer ( and possibly multi - layer ) ribbons that reconstruct into partial edge tubules  @xcite . here",
    ", the out - of - plane displacement occurs preferentially away from the edge such that the ribbon midsection curls as it ripples  @xcite .",
    "our focus here is on end - supported suspended nanoribbons shown schematically in fig .  [ fig : fig1]a . unlike freestanding nanoribbons",
    ", this architectural motif is a natural building block for next - generation nanoelectronic devices and nems devices as it allows controlled yet scalable device integration while minimizing deleterious substrate effects  @xcite .",
    "the ribbons can be trimmed to shape before or after clamping them onto the end - supports ( electrodes )  @xcite , and the two scenarios result in differing mechanical constraints on the ribbons , as detailed later in this article .",
    "little is known regarding their morphological stability for several reasons .",
    "one , the edge stress - induced morphologies reported in past studies have been analyzed primarily to understand post - buckled shapes , via atomic - scale computations or scaling analyses with attendant simplifications  @xcite .",
    "however , a detailed understanding of the pre - buckled shapes is necessary .",
    "these become tractable only in the ( linear ) small amplitude limit and a naive approach would discount their utility as the post - buckling in these atomically thin sheets is expected to take place primarily through bending - the stretching is prohibitively expensive  @xcite .",
    "this is in stark contrast to recent computations on edge morphologies of semi - infinite graphene sheets that show that stretching plays crucial , if not decisive role  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as we show below , the computed buckled shapes are quite sensitive to the initial perturbations , even more so for confined systems such as end - supported nanoribbons .",
    "then , the stability of the precursory small amplitude deformations , where both stretching and bending can influence the stability , is the key to understanding the post - buckled shapes .",
    "two , the end - supports as well as the edge - edge interactions limit the possible morphologies as they force to ribbon to be on average flat . more specifically , global buckling modes such as ( developable ) twist or saddle shapes become untenable and edge stress accommodation takes place primarily through periodic ripples that also interact across the edges .",
    "lastly , reconciliation of the shapes observed in experiments ( for e.g.  [ fig : fig1]b and  [ fig : fig1]c ) or atomic - scale simulations with elastic theories must factor in thermal effects that naturally manifest as shape fluctuations . statistical theories of polymerized elastic membranes can be invoked to account for these effects via renormalized ribbon elasticity  @xcite .",
    "while we do not address this specific issue here , it must be noted that the highly strain - sensitive bonding that stabilizes these flakes also results in strongly size - dependent and non - classical effects which can become significant at these scales  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we use stability analyses and computations to explore the morphological stability space of nanoribbons as a function of both intrinsic and engineered parameters , i.e. ribbon geometry ( width @xmath1 and length @xmath2 ) , material parameters ( sheet and edge stiffness @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) and deformation along the ribbon ( x-)axis ( uniaxial strain @xmath6 ) .",
    "atomic - scale simulations of ribbons serve as inputs for identifying the possible equilibrium shapes .",
    "although the computations focus exclusively on gnrs , we demonstrate the generality of these results via rigorous stability analyses based on isotropic elastic plate theory , which in turn allow us to develop stability diagrams for a combination of geometric , material and processing parameters .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] showcases the periodic ripples that have been observed in suspended nanoribbons . the experimental images ( [ fig : fig1]b and  [ fig : fig1]c ) show two differing morphologies , bending - like rippling in multi - layered graphene ribbons  @xcite and edge rippling in hollow bn ribbons  @xcite . the results of our atomic - scale simulations on graphene nanoribbons , summarized in  [ fig : fig1]c , reveal a considerably richer morphological space . to facilitate direct comparison with past computational studies",
    ", we have performed these computations using a reactive bond order ( airebo ) potential  @xcite as implemented in the software package lammps  @xcite ( see methods ) . for each combination of parameters , the characteristics associated with the rippling",

    "while we do not discuss the effect of ribbon length @xmath2 in detail in the remainder of the article , its main effect is to act as a constraint on the permissible wavenumbers in instances where @xmath10 .",
    "some of the shapes we observe are similar to those reported in past studies , both at zero and finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "a key feature is that we observe two dominant morphological classes for each given set of parameters : in - phase or symmetrical ripples ( s ) , and out - of - phase or asymmetrical ( as ) ripples , where the phase refers to the relative displacements of the edges .",
    "the specific form of ripples is controlled by the sign of the edge stress and the aspect ratio . for compressive stresses and sufficiently large widths ,",
    "the edges do not interact and the ribbon exhibits classical edge ripples ( not shown ) . as the width is reduced , the edge - edge interactions become important such that the ripples penetrate through the width and ribbon buckles either in- or out - of - phase  @xcite . at much smaller widths , the entire ribbon buckles with bending - like or twist - like undulations . applied longitudinal strains @xmath6 modify the midline - line morphology , as shown in the figure for symmetrically rippled ribbons .",
    "tensile edge stresses force the midline to curl out - of - plane .",
    "however , since end - conditions require the midline to be flat , we observe dimples at and around the midline which decay into the edges .",
    "the dimples can also split asymmetrically at large widths , although the mode is relatively rare . at small widths ,",
    "though , the ribbon morphology is either flat or symmetrically rippled .",
    "we note that some of these shapes , in particular symmetric ripples in ribbons with compressed edges ( e.g. filament - like buckling at small widths ) are also observed in naturally occurring ribbons such as straight - edged long leaves  @xcite . while there are parallels with the rippled shapes analyzed here , the shapes in the materially homogeneous natural systems are driven by inelastic and distributed growth strains unlike the highly localized and elastically stressed edges that characterize the nanoribbons considered here . coupled with the differing end - conditions that arise in suspended nanoribbons , the stability of the expected shapes is qualitatively different .",
    "the diverse morphologies observed in the computations are systematically analyzed using classical elastic plate theory . consider a nanoribbon of thickness @xmath11 and width @xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) clamped to supports spaced apart by a length @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the ribbon is a linear , isotropic elastic thin plate with elastic modulus @xmath13 , possion s ratio @xmath14 , and bending and stretching stiffnesses @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the edge stress @xmath5 in these atomically thin nanoribbons arises due to structural changes or reconstructions localized at the edges . in continuum limit ,",
    "then , the edge can be approximated as an elastically stressed bounding spring with negligible bending stiffness  @xcite .",
    "this composite approximation is similar in principle to the core - shell framework often invoked to describe elastic behavior or nanowires and thin films  @xcite . for a system",
    "so structured strain compatibility and force equilibrium require that the elastic hamiltonian that maps the initially flat ribbon to its deformed state , @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 , satisfies the generalized fppl - von krmn ( f - vk ) equations  @xcite .",
    "the stability of the periodic ripples can be analyzed by assuming a sinusoidal variation in the out - of - plane deflection , @xmath20 the shape satisfies the boundary conditions along the simply supported sides of the graphene nanoribbon since @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the limit of negligible transverse and shear stresses ,",

    ", @xmath31 is the unrelaxed edge stress . in cases where the ribbons are very long , or",
    "trimmed to shape following synthesis and then transferred onto the end supports , the edge stresses result in a residual longitudinal force that must be borne by the ribbon core .",
    "a simple force balance for the initially flat ribbon yields the intrinsic body strain , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the net longitudinal force .",
    "the body strain acts much like an imposed uniaxial strain over the entire ribbon core and therefore is analyzed in the context of extrinsically strained ribbons .",

    "the stability diagram yields insight into the shapes observed in atomic - scale simulations on gnrs . for unreconstructed armchair and",
    "zigzag terminations , the compressive edge stresses range from @xmath65ev / nm to @xmath66ev / nm while the edge stiffness @xmath4 varies from @xmath67 to @xmath68ev / nm  @xcite .",
    "the low bending stiffness of these atomically thin sheets ( @xmath69ev ) yields a scaled edge stress @xmath70 for nanometer - wide gnrs .",
    "the critical wavenumber is in the vicinity of the bifurcation point where both bending- and twist - like undulations are possible , although the former are energetically favored .",
    "this is corroborated by the computed morphologies for a - gnrs with varying widths , shown in  [ fig : fig1]d - e and  [ fig : fig2_2]a ( inset ) .",

    "the modified stability stability diagram , also shown in  [ fig : fig2_1]a , is based on a lengthy analytical solution which is not shown for brevity ( see si ) .",
    "it is immediately clear that the flat phase is more stable as the edge - edge interactions can be absorbed for relatively wider ribbons due to the mediating strained core . in effect",
    ", the relaxation of the edge ripples shifts to smaller wavenumbers and larger edge stresses as it now occurs with respect to an already stretched ribbon core .",
    "the bifurcation into the two morphological classes shifts accordingly ( inset ) . of importance is the dramatic effect of the intrinsic strain on the relative stability of the bending- and twist - like ripples for small aspect ratio ribbons , @xmath44 .",
    "although the critical point for bending - like ripples is still lower ( inset ) , we no longer see the quadratic dependence in the critical point for bending - like ripples .",

    "the stretching energy has contributions from both the core and the edge , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "then , the leading order term for the total energy for stretching is @xmath87 .",
    "the relation between the two amplitude constants follows from the zero net moment across the ends , which reduces to @xmath88 where the longitudinal force @xmath89 .",

    "for @xmath44 , the critical strains for bending - like shapes deviate and exhibit a quadratic dependence with @xmath8 while those for twist - like rippling are wavenumber independent . to see this , note that the critical axial force for buckling of a simply supported column is @xmath102 and @xmath103\\sim d / w$ ] , respectively for axial - flexural and axial - torsional buckling .",

    "[ fig : fig1]d for bending - like ripples in ribbons subject to tensile strains , @xmath112 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these profiles are more susceptible to twist - like rippling as the ribbon midline is largely unmodified compared to bending - like ripples .",
    "in fact , for a range of applied strains ( 0.1%-0.3% for the a - gnrs ) , the double - well shaped rippling can only occur in a twist - like fashion ( [ fig : fig3]c ) .",
    "similar peaks also occur in critical strains for ribbons with tensile edge stresses and subject to compressive applied strains .",
    "the behavior is consistent with classical euler buckling of ribbons appropriately modified due to the edge stress ; the more general morphology of ribbons subject to tensile edge stresses is discussed in the next section .",

    "the solutions for the rippled shapes in the small amplitude limit follow directly from [ eq : sinusoidalpert]-[eq : rippledbc ] and are again detailed in si ( eq .",
    "s7 )    we restrict our analysis to compressively strained ribbons as the morphology of unstrained or stretched ribbons is trivial - they are always flat since the edge stress is completely absorbed by the relevant end conditions .",
    "the reasoning is consistent with our analysis in that the critical contours for rippling shown in fig .",

    "the critical wavenumber is independent of the edge stress .",

    "the twist - like rippling in these ribbons consists of dimples that alternate across the ribbon midline , corresponding to an axial - torsional buckling mode of the ribbon core . at small wavenumbers ( width ) ,",

    "finally , the stability with respect to extrinsic compressive strains is shown in  [ fig : fig3]a - b .",
    "larger compressive strains always favor bending like ripples since the rippled mid - line is more efficient in absorbing the imposed strain",

    "the final ribbon morphology has ramifications for electronic properties that are strongly coupled to the ripples and the associated strain distribution , ranging from conductance fluctuations to band gaps . clearly , the interplay between ribbon structure , geometry and externally applied strains results in a morphological stability space that is considerably richer than the classical edge ripples that are normally associated with these crystalline nanoribbons .",
    "for example , tensile edge stresses tend to destabilize the ribbon core while forcing the edges to be flat , and the dimpled morphology affects both equilibrium and transport properties .",
