    "it was quite surprising when the binary millisecond pulsar ( msp ) j1023 + 0038 ( hereafter j1023 ) was discovered in an untargeted radio pulsar survey @xcite , because although the source was previously known to have radio emission @xcite , it was suggested to be a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) and later has been established that it is likely a low - mass - x - ray binary ( lmxb ) with a 4.75 hour orbital period and a @xmath50.2 @xmath6 companion @xcite",
    ". detailed analyses of an optical spectrum of j1023 , taken in 2001 february by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , have shown that the source at the time was in a bright state and had broad , double - peaked hydrogen and helium emission lines , a typical feature of an accretion disk @xcite . from 2002",
    "may onward , however , the source has been seen dramatically different , having only a g - type absorption spectrum @xcite and thus indicating the disappearance of the disk approximately 1.5 yrs later . combining with these observational results , the discovery of a radio pulsar has strongly suggested that this is the first such binary found at the end of its transition from a lmxb to a radio msp .",
    "msps are believed to be `` recycled '' pulsars , formed from evolution of x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "in such a binary with a low - mass companion , a neutron star was spun up by accretion of matter from the companion via an accretion disk . at the end of the interacting phase when the mass accretion rate in the disk was below a minimum value and thus the inner edge of the disk",
    "was truncated outside of the light cylinder of the neutron star by the neutron star s magnetic field , the neutron star appeared at radio frequencies as a msp ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "subsequently , the disk would be disrupted due to the radiation pressure from the fast - spinning pulsar .",
    "while this model is generally accepted , there are few observational studies of the scenario due to the lack of known systems that are right at the end of the transition .    from the estimated spin - down rate of the j1023 pulsar ,",
    "its rotational energy loss rate ( so called spin - down luminosity ) has been found to be @xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the major part of the energy should be carried out in a magnetized , high - velocity wind , which is likely interacting with the companion causing the orbital modulation @xcite and eclipses of the pulsar emission @xcite seen at optical and radio frequencies , respectively .",
    "the wind also plausibly caused the disappearance of the disk that existed in 20002001 ( however see @xcite for an alternative scenario ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the companion star in j1023 would replace its disk through repeatedly outflows . if it does , as pointed out by @xcite that the kelvin - helmholtz relaxation time for the companion is much longer than 10 years since 2001 ( see also @xcite ) , j1023 would serve as a rare example for detailed studies of features of the transitional processes and pulsar - wind  disk interaction .    in an effort to fully study this rare system and the detailed evolutionary process of such binary systems at or",
    "right after the transition phase , we have carried out infrared ( ir ) observations with ground - based and space telescopes .",
    "the accretion disk that has disappeared in the optical after 2002 may might have left an ir remnant .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of the source have found orbital variability in its x - ray emission and likely revealed an intrabinary shock @xcite .",
    "the shock , which would be produced by the interaction between the pulsar wind and outflow from the companion , might also be detectable at ir wavelengths .",
    "our observations and data reduction are described in   [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the results from the observations are given in ",
    "[ sec : res ] , and the implications of our results for j1023 are discussed in   [ sec : dis ] .",
    "our target was detected in near - ir @xmath9 bands by the 2mass all - sky survey @xcite in 2000 february 6 , but with relatively large uncertainties ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 with no uncertainty given ; @xcite ) . in order to either confirm the 2mass results or detect any variability ,",
    "we re - observed j1023 in @xmath1 bands using the 2.5-meter irne du pont telescope at las campanas observatory in chile on 2012 may 10 . the camera was the retrocam , which uses a detector of a rockwell hawaii-1 @xmath13 hgcdte array .",
    "the field of view was @xmath14 , with a pixel scale of 0.2  pixel@xmath8 .",
    "the total on - source exposure time at each band was 405  s. during an exposure , the telescope was dithered in a 3@xmath153 grid with offsets of approximately 15  to obtain the measurement of the sky background .",
    "the observing conditions were good , having 0.6  seeing .",
    "we used the iraf data analysis package for data reduction .",
    "the images were dark - subtracted and flat - fielded . from each set of dithered images in one observation ,",
    "a sky image was made by filtering out stars .",
    "the sky image was subtracted from the set of images , and then the sky - subtracted images were shifted and combined into one final image of the target field .",
    "the near - ir counterpart to j1023 was well detected in both j and h band images .",
    "we performed aperture photometry to measure brightnesses of the target and other in - field sources .",
    "flux calibration was conducted by using the 2mass sources detected in our images .",
    "we observed the target on 2010 january 15 four times with the _ spitzer _ space telescope during its warm mission phase ( program i d 60197 ) .",
    "the multiple exposures were requested in order to average out any possible orbital flux changes caused by the irradiated companion star by the pulsar .",
    "the imaging instrument used was the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) .",
    "while the camera operated in four channels at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath2 m , only the first two channels were available during the warm mission and used for our observations .",
    "the detectors at the short and long wavelengths are insb and si : as devices , respectively , both with 256@xmath15256 pixels and a plate scale of 1.2  pixel@xmath8 .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) is 5@xmath155 .",
    "the frame time was 30 s with 23.6  s and 26.8  s effective integration time per frame , and the total integration times in each of our four observations were 1.97 min and 2.23 min at channel  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the raw image data were processed through the irac data pipelines ( version s18.13.0 ) at the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) . in the basic calibrated data ( bcd )",
    "pipeline , standard imaging data reductions , such as removal of the electronic bias , dark sky subtraction , flat - fielding , and linearization , are performed and individual flux - calibrated bcd frames are produced .",
    "the details of the data reduction in the pipelines can be found in the irac instrument handbook ( version 2.0.2 ) . using a mosaicker and point source extractor ( mopex ) package , provided by the ssc , we conducted further data reduction and profile - fitting photometry . in the processes",
    ", we used the mopex pipelines overlap to perform background matching between the bcd frames , mosaic to carry out removal of cosmic rays and bad pixels , and apex to perform point source extraction . also using mosaic , final post - bcd ( pbcd ) mosaics",
    "were produced by combining the bcd frames .",
    "the target was well detected in our irac images .      launched on 2009 december 14 , the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) mapped the entire sky at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath2 m ( called w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 bands , respectively ) in 2010 with fwhms of 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 , and 12.0   in the four bands , respectively @xcite .",
    "the wise all - sky images and source catalogue were released in 2012 march .",
    "we checked the wise data and found that j1023 was detected in w1 and w2 bands but not in the other two bands .",
    "we downloaded the images of the target field from the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) .",
    "the dates of the observations and the depth of coverage of the target field were between 2010 may 2126 and 1112 pixels ( corresponding to 97106  s on - source integration time ) , respectively .",
    "we also observed j1023 on 2011 november 26 with the _ herschel _ space observatory ( obs .",
    "i d 1342233048 , 1342233049 ) .",
    "the imaging instrument used was the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) .",
    "pacs performs imaging at a blue and a red channel simultaneously , of which the central wavelengths are either 70 or 100 and 160 @xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "the detectors are a 64@xmath1532 and a 32@xmath1516 bolometer array for the blue and red channels , respectively , both with a field of view of @xmath16 .",
    "we used the mini - scan map mode of pacs for imaging at the channels of 70 @xmath2 ( bandwidth 25 @xmath2 m ) and 160 @xmath2 m ( bandwidth 85 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "the total telescope time for our observation was 1 hour with 18  min on - source time .",
    "the image data were downloaded from the _ herschel _ science archive , which were processed from the _ herschel _ data processing system at the _ herschel _ science centre ( hsc ) .",
    "the target was not detected in the images .",
    "we used the background counts at the source region and estimated the flux upper limits .",
    "the values we derived were highly consistent with that given by the _",
    "observation planning tool hspot .",
    "the obtained flux measurements for j1023 from 2mass @xmath9 , our near - ir @xmath1 , and _",
    "spitzer_/irac 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath2 m detections are listed in table  [ tab : sum ] .",
    "we assigned a 0.3  mag uncertainty to the 2mass @xmath17 band measurement .",
    "the @xmath1 magnitudes resulting from our observation are consistent with the 2mass values within the uncertainties .",
    "for the _ spitzer _ observations at each irac channel , our four flux measurements showed @xmath181.2% and @xmath183.4% differences at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath2 m , respectively , and the averaged values are given in the table .",
    "considering 2.7% and 3.5% uncertainties on the measurements from photometry at the two channels , no significant flux variations were detected .",
    "we also used the orbital period and time of ascending node provided from radio timing of the pulsar @xcite , and checked the phase duration of our _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "the phase was in a range of 0.580.67 , corresponding to 0.330.42 used in @xcite , during which the optical light curve ( emission from the companion ) of j1023 has a flat top at @xmath19 band and a @xmath20 color variation of @xmath210.02 mag ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "since the effective temperature of the companion was probably around 5700  k @xcite at the time of our _ spitzer _ observations , the expected orbital flux variations should be smaller than 0.02  mag at the mid - ir wavelengths , indicating that our result of no significant flux variations is consistent .",
    "the wise 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath2 m flux measurements from the wise catalogue are also provided in table  [ tab : sum ] . for the non - detections of j1023 in wise w3 and w4 bands and our _ herschel _ images ,",
    "flux upper limits were obtained and their 3@xmath22 values are given .",
    "the wise measurements of j1023 in w1 and w2 bands , particularly the latter , have magnitudes larger than those of the irac ( by 0.127 and 0.68 mag ) , although the differences are within 3@xmath22 uncertainties of the wise measurements .",
    "it has been noted that at the faint end starting from @xmath2315 mag at w1 and w2 bands , there is a faintward bias ( in average of 1020% ) of wise relative to irac measurements from the comparisons of photometry of sources in the ecliptic poles @xcite .",
    "this bias is suspected to be caused by stronger source confusion to wise due to its relatively lower resolution . also the comparisons show @xmath50.1 and @xmath50.2 mag ranges of scattering of wise w1 and w2 measurements , respectively , when sources are faint with @xmath2315 mag .",
    "therefore we concluded that the apparent differences of the wise measurements of j1023 relative to that of our irac are instrumental , due to the bias and larger scattering of wise w1 and w2 measurements of relatively faint sources .",
    "optical emission from j1023 after 2002 may is known to arise from the companion star , which has a g5v type optical spectrum and probably has a size approximately equal to that of the roche lobe ( 0.4 @xmath24 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we display the optical spectrum , the same one given in @xcite which was averaged from 23 spectra obtained in 2003 - 2004 by @xcite , in figure  1 .",
    "we found that the spectrum can be well fit with a g5v model spectrum @xcite with no reddening needed ( @xmath25 for 1498 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we note that in _",
    "chandra _ x - ray spectroscopic studies of the source , no hydorgen column density was needed either @xcite . at a distance of @xmath26 kpc @xcite , the companion s radius @xmath27 was found to be @xmath28 .",
    "the flux densities at near - ir 1.24 and 1.66 @xmath2 m and mid - ir 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath2 m wavelengths were thus derived from the model spectrum and they are 0.498 , 0.437 , 0.119 , and 0.076 mjy , respectively .",
    "the model flux densities are consistent with the observed values within 1@xmath22 uncertainties at near - ir wavelengths and slightly lower than that at mid - ir wavelengths ( table  2 ) .",
    "adding 2% systematic uncertainties at irac channels 1 and 2 @xcite , the values are consistent within approximately 2@xmath22 uncertainties .",
    "we thus conclude that near - ir and mid - ir emission we detected likely arose from the companion star and no significant excess ir emission was detected from the source .",
    "we estimated flux upper limits on excess mid - ir emission from j1023 . considering",
    "that near - ir and mid - ir emission detected in our ground - based and _ spitzer _ observations arose from the companion , we fit them and the optical spectrum together with the same model spectrum used above . in order to reduce the dominance of the optical spectrum",
    ", we assigned a weight of 1/150 to them .",
    "in addition , 2% systematic uncertainty from flux calibration at near - ir wavelengths and the systematic uncertainties of irac channels 1 and 2 were included .",
    "we found that @xmath29 at @xmath26  kpc provided the best - fit , and the minimum @xmath30 for 13 degrees of freedom . assuming a detection of mid - ir emission at either 3.6 or 4.5 @xmath2 m with the same uncertainty as that in our _ spitzer _ observations and fixing @xmath31",
    ", we increased the flux value at each wavelength till that @xmath32 was increased by 8.9 ( 3@xmath22 confidence ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 3@xmath22 upper limits were thus found to be 0.011 and 0.006 mjy at channels 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "it was noted by @xcite that the 2mass measurements of j1023 made on 2000 feb .",
    "6 were consistent with being at the tail of the g5v spectrum of the companion .",
    "combining with the mid - ir measurements , our more accurate near - ir @xmath1 measurements , which are approximately equal to the 2mass values , confirm the 2mass detection and the companion - star origin of the near - ir emission detected both in 2000 and at the current time .",
    "this result raises a very interesting point that in 2000 feb .",
    "the accretion disk did not exist . in figure",
    "[ fig : flux ] we over - plotted the disk model spectrum shown in @xcite and the combined spectrum of the disk plus 0.4  @xmath24 g5v star . as can be seen ,",
    "if the accretion disk had existed in 2000 feb .",
    ", the near - ir fluxes would have been approximately 2 times larger , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , based on the combined model spectrum .",
    "@xcite presented an optical spectrum of j1023 , which was taken on 2000 may 6 and contains the same emission features as the sdss spectrum .",
    "the existence of the accretion disk thus likely started after 2000 feb .",
    "6 but before may 6 .",
    "a summary of the properties of j1023 known from different observations around the time is given in table  1 ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "previously @xcite found a required time of 0.5 yrs for building the accretion disk in 2001 by considering the estimated disk mass of 10@xmath36  g and mass transfer rate of 10@xmath37 g  s@xmath8 .",
    "our constraint on the starting time of the disk existence is therefore roughly consistent with their estimation .",
    "the life time of the interacting phase should be at most 2.5 yrs from 2000 feb .",
    "to 2002 may , suggesting that for j1023 the interacting phase is of short - term in nature and that the system might repeat the short - term process in the future when the outflow from the companion could overcome the pulsar wind .",
    "close monitoring of the binary system is warranted .",
    "we have conducted multi - band imaging observations of j1023 from near- to far - ir wavelengths using ground - based and space telescopes . in the near - ir @xmath1 bands and _ spitzer _ mid - ir 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath2 m channels , we have detected the source but the emission has been found to arise from the companion star of the binary and no excess ir emission was detected .",
    "the flux upper limits on the existence of any hot ( 600800  k ) dust in the system were derived and they were in a range of 0.0060.011 mjy at mid - ir 3.64.5 @xmath2 m wavelengths . at the longer wavelengths , we did not detect emission from the source and the 3@xmath22 upper limits were approximately from 0.5 mjy at 12 @xmath2 m to 6  mjy at 160 @xmath2 m .",
    "constraints on the existence of relatively cold dust material in the binary system can be estimated from our results .",
    "a remnant of the accretion disk that was disrupted by either the pulsar wind @xcite or @xmath38-ray emission from the pulsar @xcite might stay in the system and be illuminated by the pulsar wind .",
    "we used a simple dust model given by @xcite , in which a single temperature is assumed for all dust grains , to estimate infrared emission from possible cold dust material in j1023 .",
    "the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar in j1023 was recently estimated by @xcite . considering that a fraction of this energy output @xmath39 heats the dust of two sizes , 7 and 20 @xmath2 m",
    ", we found that our ir upper limits constrain the masses of the dust to be lower than 3@xmath40  g and 3@xmath41  g , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the dust grain sizes of 7 and 20  @xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "the corresponding dust temperatures are @xmath44  k and @xmath45  k. the model spectra are displayed in figure  [ fig : flux ] .",
    "we note that @xcite have estimated 10@xmath36  g mass for the accretion disk seen in 2001 . presuming that 1% of the remnant s mass is the dust , the upper limits on the total mass of the remnant are @xmath5@xmath46  g for the dust of 300  k or @xmath5@xmath47  g for the dust of 80  k. the masses are substantially higher than the mass of the accretion disk , suggesting that the observations were not deep enough ( particularly at 8 @xmath2 m with no _ spitzer _ observations ) for the detection of the possibly existing dust material in the system .",
    "x - ray emission from j1023 has been detected with a dominant non - thermal component @xcite .",
    "combined with the fact that orbital variability was seen in the x - ray emission , the origin of the emission is likely an intrabinary shock , produced by the outflows from the two stars of the system @xcite .",
    "this shock could radiate emission in a long wavelength range from x - ray to ir wavelengths ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , assuming a single power - law emission and extending the _ chandra _ spectrum ( @xmath48 ; @xcite ) to the ir wavelengths , a flux at 10 @xmath2 m is predicted to be 10@xmath49 mjy . therefore much deeper mid- or far - ir observations than ours are needed in order to determine possible emission properties of the putative intrabinary shock at the long wavelengths .",
