    "incompressible quantum liquids ( iqls)@xcite underlie the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) discovered by tsui , stormer , and gossard.@xcite the charge carriers in these liquids are anyons , i.e. , quasiparticles ( quasielectrons and quasiholes ) carrying fractional charges@xcite and obeying fractional statistics.@xcite historically the main experimental discoveries in this field were done by magnetotransport experiments .",
    "however , the role of spectroscopic methods is continuously increasing since they provide an indispensable tool for investigating spectra of elementary excitations .",
    "fine structure specific for different electronic phases was discovered in the spectra of radiative photoemission.@xcite these spectra were used to measure gaps in the energy spectra of iql s , for investigation of phase transitions between the iql and wigner solid phases , etc .",
    "the frequency of long - wave neutral elementary excitations of iql s was measured in raman scattering experiments.@xcite    a challenging problem in physics of iql s is a direct observation of the charge fractionalization . between different exciting approaches to this problem",
    "the spectroscopic approach seems to be one of the most promising .",
    "indeed , spectroscopy permits one to observe properties of iql s in the bulk where the effect of the impurities and edges is reduced to the minimum .",
    "the intrinsic spectroscopy of iql s is the magnetospectroscopy of excitons .",
    "however , properties of excitons reflect the spectrum of the elementary excitations of an iql ( quasielectrons and quasiholes , magnetorotons,@xcite etc . ) and can be treated in terms of them only when the separation @xmath2 between electron and hole confinement planes is sufficiently large . indeed , when @xmath13 , where @xmath4 is the magnetic length , the filling factor @xmath14 of the liquid strongly deviates in the vicinity of the hole from the quantized value @xmath15 .",
    "under these conditions the properties of the iql can not be treated in terms of its quasiparticles .",
    "the spectroscopy of a remote hole has been discussed from different standpoints in a number of papers.@xcite despite the fact that experiments in the @xmath16 region are rather complicated , the separations up to @xmath17 were achieved in experiments on extrinsic radiative photoemission.@xcite of special importance might be experiments performed for a fixed filling factor @xmath18 and a variable dimensionless electron - hole separation @xmath19.@xcite the first experiments of this kind were reported recently.@xcite    the investigation of excitons is also important from the different standpoint . in the theory of iql",
    "s the statistical properties of the system of free anyons are usually discussed . in an exciton",
    "the anyons exist in a bound state because of the attracting potential of a hole .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the energy spectra of excitons of @xmath20 and @xmath21 iql s are closely related to the statistical and dynamical properties of quasielectrons of these iql s .",
    "therefore , the exciton problem can be really treated as a few - anyon problem .",
    "excitons represent a wide class of few - anyon systems .",
    "it includes excitons , anyon ions@xcite ( which can be also treated as quasiparticle - exciton complexes@xcite ) , some impurity centers , etc . in what follows ,",
    "we consider excitons as bound few - anyon composites and investigate their properties in some detail .",
    "there are two approaches to the theory of excitons in iql s .",
    "the first approach is based on the exact diagonalization for finite - size systems in the spherical geometry.@xcite having in mind workable system sizes , it provides reliable results for @xmath22 , at least as applied to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 iql s .",
    "the second approach is based on the anyon exciton model ( aem ) proposed by the present authors.@xcite in the framework of this approach an exciton is considered as a neutral composite quasiparticle consisting of several anyons and a hole .",
    "this model is exact only when the exciton size which is about @xmath2 is large compared to the size of anyons which is about @xmath4 , i.e. , for @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the two approaches are complementary and one can expect that they match when @xmath24 .    it is the main statement of the aem that excitons of iql s possess a multiple branch spectrum .",
    "indeed , a charged particle at the lowest landau level possesses a single degree of freedom and a single quantum number .",
    "an exciton being a neutral entity possesses in a magnetic field a vector momentum @xmath5 absorbing two degrees of freedom.@xcite therefore , an exciton consisting of @xmath25 anyons and a hole possesses @xmath26 internal degrees of freedom . for an ordinary magnetoexciton @xmath27 and the spectrum",
    "consists of a single branch . for @xmath28",
    "an exciton acquires internal quantum number(s ) and multiple branch spectrum .",
    "this prediction of the aem permitted apalkov _",
    "et al._@xcite to represent the energy spectra found by finite - size computations for @xmath29 and @xmath1 iql s as a system of exciton branches and to assign to these branches internal quantum numbers .",
    "the latter determine the values of the exciton angular momentum , @xmath6 , in the @xmath7 states .",
    "zang and birman@xcite and chen and quinn@xcite also inferred existence of several exciton branches in their finite - size data .",
    "in the range accessible for finite - size studies , @xmath22 , there are two types of excitons in the lower part of the energy spectrum , anyon excitons and tight excitons .",
    "_ anyon excitons _ are loose entities with a pronounced anyon - density dip at the center .",
    "they are generically related to the quantum states making up the low - energy ( anyon ) sector@xcite of the electron subsystem .",
    "each anyon exciton is a bound state of a three - quasielectron complex from the anyon sector and a hole .",
    "this finding establishes a connection between the spectroscopy of excitons and the low - energy physics of the fqhe .",
    "there is a striking difference in the quantum numbers of the low - energy anyon excitons of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 iql s .",
    "it is related to the difference in the energy spectra of the three - quasielectron complexes originating due to the different populational statistics of the quasielectrons of these liquids .",
    "_ tight excitons _ are dense entities .",
    "a sharp density maximum is achieved either in the center of an exciton or in a close vicinity of the center .",
    "these excitons are not related to the low - energy sector of the electron subsystem .",
    "the @xmath30 tight exciton is the bottom state of the exciton spectrum in all the region @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 region seems to be of the most importance for the study of the anyon substructure of excitons and for the spectroscopic observation of the charge fractionalization .",
    "we suppose everywhere in this paper that the spin - polarized background is stable with respect to formation of charged spin - textures ( skyrmions ) .",
    "it was predicted recently@xcite that spin - textures develop in the ground state of a @xmath31 exciton for large values of @xmath19 ; the critical value of @xmath19 is about 1.5 for gaas .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that the spin - polarized ground state of a @xmath20 magnetoexciton is stable because skyrmions can exist only at very low magnetic fields when @xmath32.@xcite spin - depolarized excitons should be seen in the spectrum of excited states .    in this paper",
    "we develop the theory of excitons in the framework of the aem as applied to excitons consisting of three quasielectrons and a hole .",
    "we use halperin pseudo - wave - functions@xcite in a boson basis and investigate the energy spectrum , electron density distribution , and anyon correlations in an exciton .",
    "we make comparison with the finite - size data@xcite on the excitons of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 iql s and conclude that excitons of the @xmath21 iql are described rather well by the aem because of the bosonic populational statistics and the narrow form - factors of the quasielectrons of this liquid .",
    "we also relate the difference in the energy spectra of the anyon excitons of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 iql s to some specific features in the exciton shape found in the framework of the aem . for both iql s",
    "the bottom exciton states are made by tight @xmath30 excitons for @xmath22 and by a succession of anyon excitons for @xmath3 .",
    "this succession consists of hard core excitons with the angular momenta @xmath6 which are integers of 3 and increase as @xmath33 with @xmath2 .",

    "[ sec : energy ] , [ sec : density ] , and [ sec : correlation ] we obtain energy spectra , electron density distributions , and the density correlation functions , respectively .",

    "we propose that a striking difference in the finite - size data for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 iql s originates from the difference in the populational statistics of the quasielectrons of these liquids .",
    "let us consider an exciton consisting of a valence hole with a charge @xmath34 and three qe s with electrical charges @xmath35 and statistical charges @xmath36 .",
    "such an entity provides the aem description of the anyon excitons of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 iql s . for an @xmath20 iql the statistical charge equals @xmath37 , while for an @xmath21 iql the statistical charge has the same value , @xmath38 , as for quasiholes in an @xmath20 iql .",
    "@xcite in comparison , @xmath39 for bosons and @xmath40 for fermions . in the strong magnetic field limit ,",
    "when the coulomb energy @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath43 is the dielectric constant , it is convenient to employ dimensionless variables scaled in units @xmath44 , @xmath4 and @xmath45 .",
    "we use the symmetric gauge , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a unit vector perpendicular to the confinement plane . instead of the hole , @xmath48 , and anyon , @xmath49 ,",

    "the coordinates @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the internal variables which are not affected by the translational motion of an exciton .",
    "complex coordinates @xmath54 , as well as @xmath53 , are not independent . indeed , @xmath55 despite the fact that the constraint ( [ eq1.2 ] ) results in some complications , the introduction of the variables @xmath53 enables one to develop the theory in a form symmetric in all anyons and , therefore , finally simplifies the equations .",
    "anyons and hole live in two different parallel planes separated by the distance @xmath2",
    ". nevertheless , only the 2d coordinates of eq .",
    "[ eq1.1 ] enter into the exciton wave function .",
    "the separation @xmath2 enters only into the hamiltonian of the anyon - hole interaction derived in the sec .",
    "[ subsec : anyhole ] .    the most general form of the pseudo - wave - function of an anyon exciton meeting all general requirements is as follows : @xmath56 where the pair of indices , @xmath57 , takes the values specified in eq .",

    "the basic properties of the functions @xmath61 can be checked by inspection .",
    "( i ) since the exciton is a neutral entity , it possesses an in - plane momentum @xmath5,@xcite and @xmath61 satisfies the equation of magnetic translations : @xmath62    \\psi_{l,{\\bf k}}({\\bf r } - { \\bf a } , { \\bbox \\rho } , \\ { { \\bar{z}_{jl}}\\ } )   = { \\rm e}^{- i{\\bf k}\\cdot { \\bf a } }   \\psi_{l,{\\bf k}}({\\bf r } , { \\bbox \\rho } , \\ { { \\bar{z}_{jl}}\\})~.   \\label{eq1.4}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath63 is related to the dipole moment of the exciton , @xmath64 .",
    "( ii ) the function @xmath61 belongs to the lowest landau level .",
    "indeed , the nonanalytic factor of it can be shown to have the form @xmath65 , whereas the other factors are analytic functions of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "( iii ) the function @xmath68 is a homogeneous polynomial of the degree @xmath6 which is symmetric in all coordinates @xmath69 .",
    "these polynomials form a boson basis , and the effect of the fractional statistics is taken into account by the factor @xmath70.@xcite ( iv ) a system of four charged particles in a magnetic field possesses four quantum numbers .",
    "two of them are absorbed in the 2d momentum @xmath5 .",
    "two others determine the form of the polynomial @xmath59 and are internal quantum numbers of an anyon exciton .",
    "the operator @xmath71 of the @xmath72 projection of the angular momentum commutes with the hamiltonian and the square of the momentum , @xmath73 , but it does not commute with the projections of @xmath74 , i.e. , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath61 chosen in the @xmath77 representation is simultaneously an eigenfunction of @xmath71 only for @xmath78 , and in this limit @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the quantum numbers of an anyon exciton include the 2d momentum @xmath5 and the projection of the angular momentum , @xmath79 , of the exciton with @xmath78 . the angular momentum @xmath6 numerates branches of the exciton spectrum . the fourth quantum number , which will be specified in what follows , numerates branches with coinciding values of @xmath6 .",
    "the multiple branch structure of the anyon exciton spectrum is a direct consequence of the charge fractionalization which results in the appearance of the internal degrees of freedom of an anyon exciton and of the related internal quantum numbers .    by definition ,",
    "the polynomial @xmath59 is symmetric in coordinates @xmath80 . to establish the symmetry of it in the symmetric coordinates @xmath60",

    "this transformation results in the polynomial @xmath82 which has different properties depending on the parity of @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath6 is even , the polynomial is a permanent , and , therefore , is symmetric in the coordinates @xmath60 .",
    "however , when @xmath6 is odd , the polynomial is a determinant which is obviously antisymmetric in the coordinates @xmath60 and is non - equal to zero only for @xmath84 .",
    "for example , for the lowest possible value of @xmath6 , @xmath85 , this determinant turns into a vandermonde determinant @xmath86 therefore , @xmath6-even and @xmath6-odd polynomials @xmath59 have rather different properties .",
