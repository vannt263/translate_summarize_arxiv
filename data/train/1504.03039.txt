    "the australian dark energy survey ( ozdes ) has been designed to provide efficient spectroscopic follow - up of targets identified from imaging by the dark energy survey ( des ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ozdes extends des by enabling new science goals that can not be achieved without spectroscopic information  such as supernova cosmology and reverberation mapping of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "we also enhance des by providing an important source of calibration data for photometric redshifts , which are the cornerstone for the majority of the des science programs .",
    "the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) used by ozdes and the ctio  4 m blanco telescope used by des are ideal partners for spectroscopy and imaging because they have well matched @xmath32 degree diameter fields of view ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fov ] ) .",
    "the aat and ctio  4 m are similar in several respects  both are 4 m class telescopes that were commissioned in 1974 and both have recently been rejuvenated with powerful new instrumentation : in the case of ctio it is the 570 mega - pixel dark energy camera ( decam ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while on the aat it is the new efficient aaomega spectrograph @xcite coupled with the two degree field ( 2df ) 400-fibre multi - object fibre - positioning system @xcite .",
    "the des program consists of a wide - field survey covering 5000 square degrees , as well as a rolling survey of ten fields that cover a total of 30 square degrees @xcite .",
    "these ten fields ( see table  [ tab : field_centers ] for the sky coordinates ) are targeted repeatedly over the course of the survey with a cadence of approximately 6 days in order to find transient objects , such as supernovae , and monitor variable objects , such as agn .",
    "ozdes repeatedly targets these ten fields , selecting objects that range in brightness from @xmath4 to @xmath5 mag , a range of more than a thousand in flux density .",
    "once a redshift is obtained , we deselect the target ( with some exceptions ) .",
    "objects that lack a redshift are observed until a redshift is measured .",
    "this tactic allows us to obtain redshifts for targets far fainter than ever previously achieved with the aat .",
    "together this means we can run an efficient survey of bright objects while simultaneously acquiring spectra for much fainter objects .",

    "the first season of ozdes began in 2013b ( august 2013 to january 2014 ) with 12 nights ( designated as y1 ) .",
    "allocations will progressively increase each year , to accommodate the increasing number of supernovae host galaxies that des will have accumulated in subsequent years .    in the 2012b ( august 2012 to january 2013 ) semester , a year before the start of des and ozdes , the decam was used to execute the des sn program as part of its science verification ( sv ) phase of commissioning . in parallel ,",
    "aat / aaomega-2df time was awarded for the observation of the des sn fields in a precursor program to ozdes .",
    "supplementary observing time ( 1 night during sv and 2 nights during y1 ) was also obtained through the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) .    in this paper , we present an overview of ozdes and the results obtained during the sv and y1 seasons . non - des fields and targets observed in the sv season",
    "are excluded from the analysis .",
    "when appropriate , we also discuss changes and improvements to the ozdes in y2 ( 2014b , august 2014 to january 2015 ) .",
    "we organise the paper as follows : in @xmath9  [ sec : science ] we summarise our science goals and in @xmath9  [ sec : strategy ] we present the operational details that were current at the end of y1 , highlighting what was modified to improve the efficiency of the survey for y2 .",
    "results of redshifts and quality assessments are presented in @xmath9  [ sec : results ] , followed by discussions of implications for science in @xmath9  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in @xmath9  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "here we outline the wide range of science goals we aim to achieve with ozdes .",
    "each science goal may require one or more types of target and the targeting strategies evolve with time .",
    "details of the target types used in sv and y1 are described in @xmath9  [ sec : targets ] .",
    "the main science motivation of ozdes is to obtain host galaxy spectroscopic redshifts for a sample of 2,500 type ia sne discovered by des , with the goal of improving measurements of the universe s global expansion history .",
    "this goal is efficiently achieved with aat s unique combination of multi - object fibre - fed spectroscopy and wide field of view .",
    "spectroscopy of live supernovae within a few weeks of maximum light serves the dual purpose of typing the transient ( determining whether it is a type ia sn ) and measuring its redshift .",
    "however , the spatial density of sne ia that are bright enough to be observed with the aat at any instant in time is only a handful per square degree .",
    "an 810 metre class telescope is often required for such observations , but can usually only observe one object at a time .",
    "this mode of follow - up is thus time - consuming and requires an unrealistically large quantity of resources to acquire a large sample .",
    "alternatively , well sampled multicolour light curves can be used to reliably identify a sn ia @xcite , after which a spectrum of the host galaxy can be used to measure its precise redshift .",
    "host galaxy redshifts can also be used to improve photometric classification @xcite .",
    "host galaxies can be observed at any time , even after the supernova has faded .",
    "thus one can wait to collect many supernovae in a field before measuring their host - galaxy redshifts efficiently with multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "this strategy has been tested in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - ii , * ? ? ? * ) and the supernova legacy survey ( snls , * ? ? ?",
    "the other primary science goal of ozdes is reverberation mapping of agn and quasars .",
    "reverberation mapping @xcite is an effective way to measure supermassive black hole masses in agn , over much of the age of the universe .",
    "this is possible because the continuum emission from the agn accretion disk is variable , and this continuum emission photoionizes the clouds of gas at larger scales that give rise to the characteristic broad emission lines of most agn .",
    "as the continuum emission varies in intensity , the broad emission lines reverberate in response with a time delay that depends on the light travel time from the continuum source .",
    "measurement of this time delay provides a geometric size for the broad line region .",
    "this size scale can be used to measure the mass of the supermassive black hole through application of the virial theorem and measurement of the velocity width of the broad emission line .",
    "approximately 50 agn have reverberation - based black hole masses to date , and the masses of these black holes agree well with mass measurements from stellar dynamics @xcite and yield the same slope as the @xmath10 relation that holds for quiescent galaxies @xcite .",
    "the size scale , typically determined from the h@xmath11 emission line , is also very well correlated with the agn luminosity with the @xmath12 scaling expected from a simple photoionization model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the relatively small scatter in this relation was used by @xcite to demonstrate that agn could be used as standard candles .",
    "the current sample of about 50 agn with reverberation - based masses are all in low to moderate luminosity agn , and nearly all in the relatively nearby universe ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is because reverberation mapping requires a substantial amount of telescope time to measure the time lags , and it has proven most straightforward to get the necessary allocation to observe bright objects with small telescopes .",
    "the lower - luminosity agn also have lags of only days to weeks , and thus can be measured with a single semester of data .",
    "it is much more difficult to measure the year or longer lags of the most luminous agn at redshifts @xmath14 and higher ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; yet these agn are arguably the most interesting as they represent the majority of supermassive black hole growth in the universe .",
    "ozdes is presently monitoring @xmath31000 agn up to @xmath15 and aims to measure reverberation lags and black hole masses for approximately 40% of the final sample ( king et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "this new , multi - object reverberation mapping project , as well as other similar efforts @xcite , will provide a wealth of new data on black hole masses out to and beyond the peak of the agn era .",
    "we will also use new measurements of the radius - luminosity relation to construct a hubble diagram out to higher redshifts than can be reached with supernovae , which provides some complementary constraints on the time variation in dark energy @xcite .",
    "concurrent ozdes and des observing enables time - critical spectroscopic observations of transients discovered in imaging . with a monthly observing cadence , ozdes is expected to target several hundred active transients , putting these at highest priority .",
    "this sample , supplemented by observations of fainter events by larger telescopes , will provide crucial validation of the photometric sn classification and enable detailed studies of these sne .",
    "we target all kinds of transient candidates , including those with uncertain physical nature .",
    "a survey of this size and scope expects to find surprises in the data . with our targeting strategy",
    "we aim to investigate the unexpected and potentially find as - yet unidentified classes of transients .",
    "a core requirement of des is to obtain accurate photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath16 ) for the majority of galaxies in the wide survey .",
    "this will enable key science goals , such as the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) with millions of galaxies , and the use of weak lensing for cosmology .",
    "our spectra play an important role in providing a spectroscopic sample for calibrating and testing the des photometric redshifts , and a significant number of our fibres are allocated to luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) , emission line galaxies ( elg ) , and other photo-@xmath16 targets .",
    "redshifts from ozdes have already been used in a number of recently published studies on des photometric redshifts . @xcite",
    "have used the redshifts to evaluate the performance of various photo-@xmath16 methods on des sv data and found several codes to produce photo-@xmath16 precisions and outlier fractions that satisfy des science requirements .",
    "@xcite combines optical data from des and near - infrared ( nir ) data from vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to improve photo-@xmath16 performance .",
    "in particular , selection criteria based on optical - nir colors are applied to identify lrg targets at high redshift ( @xmath17 ) for ozdes .",
    "spectroscopic results are used to verify the effectiveness of this selection method .",
    "the large number of fibres available to 2df allows us to pursue a wide range of supplementary science goals .",
    "these include the following :    * gathering redshifts of galaxies selected from the atlas ( australia telescope large area survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* franzen et al . in prep ,",
    "banfield et al . in prep ) .",
    "atlas is a deep , 14/17 ujy / beam rms , 1.4 ghz survey of 3.6/2.7 deg@xmath18 of the cdfs / elais - s1 survey fields which have > 90% overlap with the des deep imaging . atlas is being used to study the astrophysics of radio sources , and is also being used as a pathfinder to develop the science and techniques for the primary radio continuum survey ( emu ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) .",
    "atlas has detected over 5000 radio sources of which at least half will be targeted by ozdes over the course of the survey .",
    "these redshifts will be used to determine the evolution of the faint radio population , including both star forming galaxies and radio agn , up to redshift greater than one .",
    "they will also be used to calibrate photometric and statistical redshift algorithms for use with the 70 million emu sources ( for which spectroscopy is impractical ) .",
    "furthermore , the detected optical emission lines will provide insights into the detailed astrophysics within these galaxies , including distinguishing star forming galaxies from agn .",
    "* confirming previously unknown cluster candidates and gathering redshifts for cluster galaxies , especially central galaxies for the calibration of the cluster red sequence , as well as validation of cluster photometric redshifts .",
    "our repeated returns to the same field allow us to collect redshifts for multiple galaxies in a single cluster .",
    "usually this is impossible for all but very nearby clusters because the instrumental limit of fibre collisions prevents one from measuring closely neighbouring galaxies in the same exposure .",
    "* measuring redshifts for both the lens and the background lensed galaxy or quasar in strong lens candidates . some of the lensed quasar targets may be suitable for time - delay experiments .      about 10% of fibres",
    "are used for targets that facilitate the the calibration of the data .",
    "these include :    * regions that are free of objects ( sky fibres ) .",
    "some of our targets are 100 times or more fainter than the sky in the @xmath19 fibre aperture , so a good estimate of the sky brightness is crucial . *",
    "f stars that are used to monitor throughput , which is heavily dependent on the seeing and the amount of cloud cover .",
    "up to 15 f stars are observed per field and used to derive a mean sensitivity curve .",
    "the variation of the sensitivity curve over each plate allows for an estimate of the accuracy of the flux calibration and the mean value allows us to appropriately weight data that are obtained over multiple occasions . *",
    "candidate hot ( t@xmath20 ) da ( hydrogen atmosphere ) white dwarfs ( wds ) that can be used as primary flux calibrators for the des deep fields .",
    "stellar atmosphere modeling uncertainties for hot da wds are small so that synthetic photometry can be compared with des observations with an expected accuracy of 23% or better per candidate",
    ". a collection of @xmath3100 such candidates over the des deep fields will allow one to test the accuracy of the photometric calibration of the des deep fields .",
    "the number of known da wds in the des deep fields is currently too small to make this test , so we aim to find new ones .",
    "the 2df robotic positioner allows up to 392 targets to be observed simultaneously over a field of view 2.1 degrees in diameter ( there are also 8 fibre bundles for guiding ) .",
    "the projected fibre diameter is approximately two arcsec .",
    "two sets of fibres are provided on separate field plates mounted back - to - back on a tumbler .",
    "configuration of all fibres on a single plate takes about 40 minutes and can be done as the other plate is being observed , thereby greatly reducing overheads .",
    "a minimum separation of 30 to 40 arcsec between fibres is imposed by the physical size of the rectangular fibre buttons .",
    "this constraint and other hardware limits are respected by the custom fibre configuration software .",
    "the fibres feed aaomega , which is a bench mounted double beam spectrograph sitting in one of the coude rooms of the aat .",
    "the light from the fibres is first collimated with a mirror before passing through a dichroic which splits the light at 570  nm into two arms , one red and one blue . in the blue arm",
    ", we used the 580v grating ( dispersion of 1  a per pixel ) . in the red arm , we used the 385r grating ( dispersion of 1.6  a per pixel ) .",
    "the resulting wavelength coverage starts at 370  nm and ends at 880  nm , with a resolution of r@xmath31400 .",
    "up until the beginning of 2014 , the detectors were two 2k@xmath214k e2v ccds .",
    "these detectors were replaced with new , cosmetically superior and more efficient 2k@xmath214k e2v ccds during 2014 @xcite .",
    "the full sv and y1 observing log is shown in table  [ tab : observing_log ] .",
    "the standard observing sequence for a field configuration is 3 consecutive 40 minute exposures . in practice ,",
    "the sequence is constrained by observing conditions and field observability .",
    "among the ten des sn fields , the two deep fields ( c3 and x3 ) take priority in the scheduling and have accumulated the longest integration time , about 16 hours compared to an average of 7 hours for the shallow ones .    for each configuration",
    ", we took a single arc and up to two fibre flats .",
    "the arc is used for wavelength calibration , while the flats are used to define the location of the fibres on the detector ( the so - called tram line map ) and to determine the relative chromatic throughput of the fibres .    at the end of each",
    "run the nightly bias and dark frames are combined to produce a master bias frame and a master dark frame . during our first observing season , the blue ccd contained several notable defects .",
    "the master bias and master dark were used to mitigate the impact of these defects on the science exposures . by comparison ,",
    "the red ccd was cosmetically superior , so the corresponding master bias and master dark for the red ccd were not needed ( indeed , applying the correction just added noise ) .",

    "the number of targets greatly exceeds the number of fibres , so not all targets can be observed .",
    "based on the scientific importance of the targets , we assign a priority ( larger number for higher priority ) and a quota to each type of object , as defined in table  [ tab : target_type ] .    from the initial input catalog , the prioritised target list is selected based on priority and quota , starting with the highest priority and ending at priority 4 .",
    "targets of a particular type are randomly selected up to its quota .",

    "the red and blue halves of the spectra are then spliced . at this stage , we do not weight the data before we combine it . in future versions of the ozdes pipeline , we will weight the spectra and both the splicing and combining will be merged into a single step .",
    "all spectra are visually inspected by ozdes team members using the interactive redshifting software ` runz ` , originally developed by will sutherland for the 2dfgrs . `",
    "runz ` first attempts an automatic redshift determination by both cross - correlating to a range of galaxy and stellar templates and searching for emission line matches .",
    "it then displays the spectrum and marks the locations of the common emission and absorption features at the best redshift estimate .",

    "the earlier the follow - up campaign starts , the more information it will gather to understand the explosion physics . in the exciting case of an unknown type of transient , early observations may be vital for the interpretation of its true nature and the only chance to observe it if it is short - lived .",
    "spectral classification of a sn is usually done by comparison to templates .",
    "the best match type and age are found through either cross - correlation ( e.g. the supernova identification , ` snid ` , * ? ? ? * ) or chi - square minimization ( e.g. ` superfit ` , * ? ? ?",
    "during the first season of ozdes , we observed 320 transients and determined the redshifts ( mostly from features of the host galaxies ) of about 73% of them .",
    "of these , 12 were positively identified as supernovae @xcite .",
    "this is a small fraction of all transients .",
    "there are a number or reasons for this .",
    "first , one of the aims of ozdes is to explore the range of transient phenomena that exists in the des deep fields , so a deliberate decision was made to target objects that were clearly not sn .",
    "this includes objects that turned out to be agn or variable stars .",
    "second , the amount of host galaxy light relative to sn light that enters the @xmath37 2df fibre is larger than is normally the case for long slit observations , which typically use slits that are @xmath38 wide .",
    "this , coupled with the typical seeing at the aat ( @xmath37 ) , makes the sn less clearly visible in spectra from 2df .",
    "third , sn typing relies on identifying broad spectral features . at the beginning of y1 , the pipeline that was used to process the data imprinted features to the spectra ( e.g. a discontinuity between the red and blue halves ) that obfuscated the sn signal . only the brightest sn in y1",
    "could be identified with confidence .",
    "while the y1 spectra are suitable for determining redshifts , artefacts that come from the processing result in data that are less suitable for other analyses , such as the spectral typing of transients .",
    "the most common artefact is a flux discontinuity in the overlap region between the red and blue halves of the spectra .    since the first year of the ozdes campaign",
    ", considerable work has gone into mitigating these artefacts by improving the algorithms in ` 2dfdr ` .",
    "these improvements include better tramline tracking , implementation of optimal extraction ( which leads to more accurate treatment of the background scattered light ) , better flat fielding , more effective cosmic ray removal and improved flux calibration . during y1 , we have used the sensitivity functions provided with ` 2dfdr ` to do the flux calibration . in future versions of the ozdes pipeline",
    ", we will use the f stars that are observed contemporaneously with the other targets to do the flux calibration .",
    "absolute calibration will be done using the broad band des photometry .",
    "not all of the above algorithms are implemented at once , but better data reduction has already helped us to classify 50% more sne in y2 than in y1 .",
    "reprocessing of the entire ozdes data set from y1 and y2 is planed , after which redshifts and spectra will be publicly released ( childress et al . in prep ) .",
    "during y1 and sv , 10482 unique targets were observed and 6727 redshifts ( with quality flag 3 and above ) were obtained .",
    "figure [ fig : hist_rz ] shows the redshift distributions for selected targets .",
    "the fraction of objects with measured redshifts and their number are listed in table  [ tab : target_type ] for each type of target . for selected groups of extragalactic objects",
    ", we also show the completeness of redshifts as a function of integrated magnitude within the fibre diameter ( figure  [ fig : hist_comp ] ) . for non - transient objects ,",
    "photometry measurements are taken from the des sv gold catalog ( rykoff et al . , in prep ) . for transients ,",
    "the magnitude does not include the flux of the underlying host and represents luminosity measured in the last epoch when the target was selected .",
    "as expected , the probability of a successful redshift measurement drops for fainter targets .",
    "this trend is weak for the transients because the redshifts of most transients are inferred from spectral features of their hosts .",
    "strength of such features depends on the host luminosity , redshift and location of the transient relative to its host .",
    "the redshift efficiency is the likelihood of measuring a redshift above a certain quality level in a given observation time .",
    "difference in completeness during comparable integration times reflects difference in efficiency for different types of targets . in general ,",
    "emission lines allow measurements of redshift for sources with faint continuum , while cross - correlation for a galaxy without identifiable emission features relies on well measured spectral shape , combined with absorption features that are usually relatively weak , and therefore needs brighter continuum .",
    "hence , for elgs , the efficiency is less sensitive to the integrated broad - band magnitude than for the lrgs .    in practice ,",
    "the elgs are selected to be at @xmath39 , so only the [ oii ] @xmath40 3726,3728 doublet is within our wavelength range .",
    "this double line appears blended at the resolution of our spectra , and although it can often be recognized as a wide or flat - topped line , it is a single feature that is prone to misidentification .",
    "it is hard for redshifters to say conclusively that it is [ oii ] and not another line or an artefact . a high fraction of the elgs are therefore rated at a redshift quality of 3 .",
    "the nominal target type is known to the redshifter . for elgs , lrgs and agn",
    ", this may cause the redshifter to assign a higher redshift quality flag than would be the case if the target type was not available to the redshifter .",
    "sn hosts show lower completeness across a wide magnitude range than either elgs or lrgs ( see figure  [ fig : hist_comp ] ) . this sample is selected based on criteria independent of whether the galaxy is of early or late type .",
    "the redshift range may be constrained by the selection criteria , but knowing the target type does not directly help in determining a redshift .    at a given magnitude",
    ", the redshift completeness grows with integration time .",
    "many of the faint targets are expected to be observed in multiple seasons and accumulate significantly more signal than obtained so far .",
    "the data from y1 do not have sufficient range of exposure time to determine this trend with much certainty .",
    "in oneill et al .",
    "( in prep ) , we use data gathered by the end of y2 to model how the number of redshifts acquired increase as a function of number of visits to the field , for various types of targets with different magnitude and redshift distributions .",
    "we then estimate the redshift completeness of the survey and the number of objects we are likely to observe by extrapolating to a total of 25 visits .",
    "we are on track to obtain redshifts for 80% of all sn host galaxies that are targeted .",
    "estimates of the redshift precision based on emission line fitting or template cross - correlation may suffer different biases . for almost all of our target groups ,",
    "a combination of techniques has been used .",
    "it is recognized that for most of our science cases , we exceed the minimum requirement of precision .",
    "therefore , we do not attempt to assign accurate uncertainties for individual redshift measurements , but instead provide an overall statistical error estimate for classes of targets , based on the dispersion in measured redshifts for individual objects with multiple independent measurements , either from different observing runs or from appearing in the overlap regions of the des fields . objects with inconsistent redshift measurements are excluded ( see next section ) . for each object",
    ", we calculate the pair - wise differences of these redshifts , divided by @xmath41 .",
    "the distributions are examined for several populations of extra - galactic objects .",
    "we quote the 68 percent ( @xmath42 ) and 95 percent ( @xmath43 ) inclusion regions in table [ tab : error ] , since the distributions have extended tails .",
    "typical uncertainties ( @xmath42 ) for agn and galaxies are 0.0015 and 0.0004 respectively .",
    "we also compare our results against the redshifts from other surveys covering our targeted sky area . only redshifts with the most confident quality flag defined by the corresponding survey are considered .",

    "no significant systematic offset is found between ozdes and surveys such as gama @xcite or sdss @xcite .",
    "distributions of the differences between our redshifts and those from other surveys are consistent with the internal comparisons .",
    "a large number of agn were targeted repeatedly from run to run by design .",
    "this allows us to split the sample and quote the uncertainties in two redshift bins .",
    "the redshifts of agn are often measured by cross - correlating with template spectra . due to intrinsic variation of the emission profiles from agn to agn ,",
    "the precision of a measurement depends on the quality of the template , the wavelength region included in the cross - correlation and/or the line chosen by the redshifter to centre on . at redshift one and above , high ionization emission lines with large profile variation , such as ciii ] or civ",
    "are often used , resulting in larger uncertainties in the redshifts .",
    "the number of repeated observations is small for all other galaxy targets as they are usually removed when secure redshifts are obtained . to investigate possible type dependence , we examine separately the dispersions for elg , lrg and sn host targets .",
    "the smaller dispersion for the elgs is consistent with the expectation that better constraints can be obtained from narrow emission lines .      for a quantitative evaluation of the reliability of our redshifts",
    ", we compare multiple redshifts obtained for the same objects from independent observations , either from different observing runs or from appearing in the overlap regions of the des fields . for each redshift",
    ", we calculate its offset from a redshift that is deemed to be correct . for simplicity",
    ", we call this value the base redshift .",
    "we elaborate on how the base value is determined below .",
    "a redshift is considered wrong if it differs from the base redshift by more than @xmath44 for a agn or @xmath45 for a galaxy , which are roughly ten times the standard deviations measured from the previous section .",
    "the base redshift can be obtained from either internal or external sources . internally ,",
    "if a redshift with a higher quality flag exists , we consider that redshift as the base redshift .",
    "otherwise , the median value is used if more than two redshifts are available or a random selection is made assuming at least one measurement is correct .",
    "the external redshifts are chosen from other surveys to have the highest quality flag defined .",
    "when a conflict between an ozdes redshift and an external redshift is found , the ozdes spectra are re - examined . in three cases ( for quality 3 agn ) , the data quality is not good enough to confirm either redshift .",
    "these are excluded in the calculations .",

    "the lower median redshift for the observed sample is mainly due to the difficulty of measuring redshifts in more distant and fainter galaxies . in the two deep fields ( c3 and x3 ) , half of the sne ia host galaxies are fainter than 24th magnitude in r - band and",

    "for example , we will be able to measure luminosity functions for star - forming galaxies to @xmath53 * ( the expected knee of the luminosity function at @xmath16=1 ) . * to calibrate and develop photometric and statistical redshift algorithms for use with the 70 million emu @xcite sources ( for which spectroscopy is impractical ) . * to measure line widths and ratios of emission lines to distinguish star forming galaxies from agn , low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) , etc , and identify quasars and broad - line radio galaxies .",
    "* to measure how radio polarisation evolves with redshift , as a potential measure of cosmic magnetism .",
    "* to explore how morphology and luminosity of radio - loud agn evolve with redshift , to understand the evolution of the jets and feedback mechanisms .",
    "the large number of spectra taken by ozdes almost guarantees discoveries of rare events or objects . even in the photometrically selected samples",
    ", outliers are expected to exist .",
    "although an exhaustive search for unusual objects is beyond the scope of this work , we highlight this potential by noting some objects that clearly stand out when the spectra were visually inspected in ` runz ` .",
    "these objects fall in the following broad categories :    1 .",
    "_ unusual transients _ : time sensitive observations of live transients are of high priority .",
    "to maximize the discovery space , we target all transients that satisfy a straightforward magnitude cut . as discussed in @xmath9  [ sec : transient_classification ] , studies of transient spectra have been complicated by host galaxy light contamination and data reduction issues .",
    "a more systematic investigation will be carried out when data reduction is refined .",
    "_ rare stars _ : at least four wd and m - dwarf binaries are recognized as galactic objects with both a hot and a cool spectral components .",
    "we have also found a wd candidate that is likely a rare dq wd ( with carbon bands ) .",
    "3 .   _ serendipitous spectroscopic sn _ : a sn may be observed unintentionally for two reasons .",
    "it happens to occur in a galaxy where a redshift is desired or it is mis - classified into a different target type . during the sv season , one of the photo-@xmath16 targets turned out to be a type ii sn .",
    "the chance for this to happen drops significantly in subsequent seasons as long - term photometry becomes available .",
    "however , the first possibility becomes more likely as more galaxies are targeted .",
    "approximately one sn occurs every century in a milky way - like galaxy and a sn remains bright for a few weeks to a few months .",
    "it is thus expected that every few thousand galaxy spectra at relatively low redshift may contain a visible sn .",
    "the concept of spectroscopic sn search has been successfully tested @xcite .",
    "however , such a survey method requires more than human eyes because the host galaxy light often dominates and has to be carefully modeled .",
    "4 .   _ broad absorption line ( bal ) agn _ : a large number of agn are observed as reverberation mapping targets , radio sources , galaxies or transients .",
    "more than a dozen of these exhibit extraordinary absorption line systems .",
    "selected objects will be monitored throughout our survey .",
    "_ multiple redshifts _ : if two objects fall in the same fibre , two distinct sets of spectral features may be observed .",
    "searching for double redshifts in galaxy spectra provides a way of finding strong gravitational lens candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , particularly for small einstein radii and faint background sources that are hard to detect by imaging .",
    "four ozdes targets were noticed to show convincing features at two different extra - galactic redshifts .",
    "inspection of the images reveal that two of these are merely chance alignment between background sources and foreground galaxies .",
    "the remaining two systems are lens candidates , both consisting of a foreground early type galaxy and a background emission line galaxy .",
    "ozdes is an innovative spectroscopic program that brings together the power of multi - fibre spectrograph and time - series observations . in five years ,",
    "each des sn survey field will be targeted in about 25 epochs during the des observing seasons by the 2df / aaomega spectrograph on the aat .",
    "the 400 fibres are configured nightly to target a range of objects with the goal of measuring spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies , monitoring spectral evolution of agn or classifying transients .",
    "stacking of multi - epoch spectra allows ozdes to measure redshifts for galaxies that are as faint as @xmath2 mag . along with efficient redshifting and recycling of fibres ,",
    "we expect to obtain about 2,500 host galaxy redshifts for the des sn cosmology study .",
    "the long term time series , contemporaneous with decam imaging , will enable reverberation mapping of the largest agn sample to date .",
    "in addition , ozdes is an important source of redshifts for various des photo-@xmath16 programs .    in the above sections ,",
    "we have summarized the ozdes observing strategy , reported results from the first year of operation and evaluated the outcome in light of various science goals .",
    "overall , our strategy has worked well in the first year and produced a large number of redshifts with good quality .",
    "we are on track to achieve our main science goals .",
    "meanwhile , we have identified a number of areas for improvements , including better data reduction procedures to reduce artefacts and more rigorous cross - check to raise redshift reliability .    by the time of writing ,",
    "the second observing season ( y2 ) has completed and already a number of updates have been implemented",
    ". additional data and better understanding of the survey yield has allowed us to reassess target selection and de - selection criteria for different target types and science goals .",
    "for example , targeting the brightest objects first maximizes the number of measured redshifts for radio galaxies , but such tactics only work when selection bias is not a major consideration .",
    "it is also desirable to abandon an unsuccessful target after certain number of exposures while the maximum integration time allowed depends on the total number of redshifts anticipated for this particular target type .",
    "short integration times allow faster recycling of fibres and more redshifts to be measured . during poor observing conditions ,",
    "a backup program is in place to measure redshifts for bright galaxies , along with high priority targets such as agn and active transients .    as for all long - term projects ,",
    "we expect to continue to refine our data quality , actively analyze new data and adapt the observing strategy in the coming years .",
