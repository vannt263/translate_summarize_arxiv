    "the h@xmath13 molecular ion is a key molecule for the gas phase chemistry in interstellar clouds ( herbst & kemplerer 1973 ; watson 1973 ) . produced by the fast reaction of h@xmath0 with h@xmath14 , it reacts with almost all neutral atoms and molecules , and thus it is the precursor of a large number of complex neutral and ionic molecular species . initially suggested to be present in molecular clouds by martin et al .",
    "( 1961 ) , there is a long history behind the search for this crucial molecule . due to its lack of permanent dipole moment",
    ", h@xmath13 must be observed in the near  ir through its ro - vibrational transitions ( oka 1980 ) .",

    "( 1998 ) , and more recently in the line of sight toward several galactic center clouds ( oka et al . 2005 ) . unfortunately",
    ", these observations only provide information on the h@xmath13 abundance in the most diffuse and warm external layers of molecular clouds , and are limited to lines of sight with bright near - ir background sources .    a different approach to study h@xmath13 in denser regions obscured by dust extinction",
    "is to observe the asymmetrical species h@xmath0d@xmath1 and hd@xmath14 , which do have a rotational spectrum .",
    "these species play a crucial role in the deuteration enhancement of many molecular species in clouds with kinetic temperatures below @xmath1230  k ( see , e.g. , gerlich et al . , 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the h@xmath0d@xmath1/h@xmath13 abundance ratio is expected to dramatically increase above the elemental d / h ratio as the gas cools down .",
    "the first calculation of the h@xmath0d@xmath1 rotational spectrum was reported by dalgarno et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , who suggested that it could be detectable in dense and cold clouds . the h@xmath0d@xmath1 1@xmath15 - 1@xmath4 transition has been observed in the laboratory at 372.42134 ghz ( bogey et al .",

    "ground - based observations of h@xmath0d@xmath1 and hd@xmath14 have always been performed toward very dense and cold cores as the high einstein coefficients of the involved transitions require high volume densities to produce significant emission .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to estimate the h@xmath0d@xmath1 abundance in lower density regions through submillimeter observations . in this letter",
    ", we report on the first detection of h@xmath0d@xmath1 in the far - ir spectrum of sgr b2 observed with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) .",
    "the observed transition connects the ground state , 1@xmath4 , with the 2@xmath5 level at 113.4 k , and has a wavelength of 126.853 @xmath3 m .",
    "this detection opens the possibility to detect h@xmath0d@xmath1 in clouds with moderate volume density in which the 1@xmath16 - 1@xmath4 transition at 372 ghz will be subthermally excited and its intensity too weak to be detected with currently available radio telescopes .",
    "it also opens the quest to detect h@xmath0d@xmath1 toward far - ir luminous galaxies and high redshift objects .",
    "the data presented in this paper are based on the final calibration analysis of the high spectral resolution line survey of sgr b2 obtained with the long wavelength fabry - prot spectrometer ( lws / fp ) on board iso in its l03 mode ( polehampton 2002 ; polehampton et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the data for nh@xmath0 , which are necessary to interpret the h@xmath0d@xmath1 absorption reported in this paper , were previously presented by goicoechea et al .",

    "the procedure to reduce the lws / fp data have been described in detail by polehampton et al .",
    "this provides a significant improvement over the previous reduction of goicoechea et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who did not apply any interactive processing to the standard pipeline data products except for the removal of glitches , averaging of individual scans and removal of baseline polynomials .",
    "the improvements applied in the full spectral survey reduction include determination of accurate detector dark currents ( including stray light ) , improved instrumental response calibration ( including a correction to account for adjacent fp orders ) and interactive shifting of individual miniscans ( to correct for uncertainty in the angle of the lws grating ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was also enhanced by including every available observation in the survey ( in this case 2 independent observations ) . the broad absorption feature shown in figure 1",
    "was previously assigned only to p - nh2 ( goicoechea et al . , 2004 ; transition 2@xmath27 - 1@xmath15 j=5/2 - 3/2 ) .",
    "however , the final reduction of the lws / fp survey toward sgr b2 shows that the broadening is real .",
    "the feature appears in 2 independent observations : iso tdt number 50601112 , observed on 1997 april 5 with lws detector lw2 ; and iso tdt number 50800515 , observed on 1997 april 7 with lws detector lw3 .",
    "the fact that the feature appears on 2 separate detectors rules out any spurious instrumental broadening of the p - nh2 line .",
    "taking into account the latest data reduction , the broad feature detected at @xmath7126  @xmath3 m can not be due to p - nh@xmath0 alone .",
    "in fact , nh@xmath0 far - ir lines are narrow and appear only at the velocity of sgr b2 ( see , van dishoeck et al . , 1993 , for the detection of nh@xmath0 in the submm ) .",

    "the upper panel shows the data and the expected contribution of p - nh@xmath0 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the middle panel shows the o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 line profile after subtracting the contribution from p - nh@xmath0 .",
    "finally , the lower panel shows the absorption of ch for comparison purposes . ]",
    "only a few lines remain unidentified in the iso far - ir line survey of sgrb2 .",
    "the feature discussed in this paper must correspond to a line arising from a low energy level or to a blend of lines .",
    "however , molecules heavier than h@xmath0d@xmath1 could have other lines in the far - ir domain .",
    "we have considered the possibility of b - type transitions from slightly asymmetric rotors like hnco and hoco@xmath1 .",
    "both have one transition at similar wavelengths .",
    "however , the line of hnco involves two high energy levels and can be easily ruled out .",
    "hoco@xmath1 has several other lines in the 120 - 127 @xmath3 m range involving low energy levels .",
    "none of which are detected in the far - ir line survey of sgr b2 ( polehampton et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "hence , we are confident that the broad feature detected at 126.853 @xmath3 m corresponds to h@xmath0d@xmath1 .",
    "the intensity scale in figures 1 and 2 was obtained by dividing the observed flux by a fitted continuum as described by polehampton et al .",
    "hence , it is directly related with the line opacity convolved with the instrumental spectral profile of the lws / fp spectrometer .",
    "the velocity scale in figure 1 has been obtained assuming @xmath28=126.853  @xmath3 m ( 2363.325 ghz ) , i.e. , the wavelength of the o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 2@xmath29 - 1@xmath30 transition ( amano & hirao , 2005 ) . the expected error on the frequency of this transition is @xmath12 5 mhz , i.e. , a velocity uncertainty @xmath31 2 km s@xmath6 ( 3@xmath32 ) , which is much lower than the spectral resolution of the lws / fp spectrometer .",

    "2004 ) . in order to compute the expected contribution of the p - nh@xmath0 2@xmath27 - 1@xmath15 triplet at @xmath12126 @xmath3 m",
    "we have modeled the nh@xmath0 absorption assuming a rotational temperature of 20  k , an intrinsic linewidth of 10 km s@xmath6 , a total nh@xmath0 column density of 1.2@xmath810@xmath34  @xmath10 ( goicoechea et al .",
    "2004 ) , and an ortho / para ratio of 3 .",
    "nh@xmath0 wavelengths and line strengths are from the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( mller et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the nh@xmath0 hyperfine structure is unresolved by the lws / fp . the synthetic spectrum , convolved with the lws / fp spectral resolution , is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the expected contribution from p - nh@xmath0 to the absorption feature is shown as a continuous line in the upper panel of figure 1 .",
    "the middle panel of this figure shows the same data with the expected contribution from p - nh@xmath0 removed .",
    "the remaining absorption feature is broad and has several absorption velocity peaks , which are similar to those found in unsaturated ground  state transitions of light species such as the ( 2,3/2)-(1,1/2 ) line of ch ( see bottom panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , in the following , we assign this unidentified broad feature to the o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 2@xmath5 - 1@xmath4 line .",
    "h@xmath0d@xmath1 is an asymmetric molecule with @xmath35 @xmath120.6 d ( dalgarno et al . , 1973 ) .",
    "it has two different species , ortho ( ka = odd ) , and para ( ka = even ) , with a spin weight ratio of 3:1 .",
    "the three lowest energy levels , 1@xmath4 , 1@xmath15 and 2@xmath5 , which are at 0 , 17.9 and 113.4 k ( see insert in the middle panel of figure 1 ) , are enough to compute the partition function ( f@xmath36 ) at low temperatures .",
    "hence , f@xmath37",
    "@xmath12 3(1+e@xmath38 ) is a good approximation for t@xmath39 @xmath31 30 k , where t@xmath39 is the rotational temperature .",
    "for example , f@xmath36(3 k)= 3.004 ( all molecules in the ground state ) , while f@xmath36(30 k)=4.8 .",
    "although the 1@xmath15 level starts to be populated in this case , the 2@xmath5 one is still unpopulated .",
    "consequently , if there is a strong continuum source behind or inside the source , we could expect to see the 2@xmath5 - 1@xmath4 transition of o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 in absorption .",
    "the same behavior is observed in ch toward sgr  b2 , where only the ground - state line is observed with the line profile shown in the bottom panel of figure  1 ( goicoechea et al .",
    "2004 ; polehampton et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the einstein coefficient of the o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 2@xmath5 - 1@xmath4 transition is large , 1.7@xmath810@xmath40 s@xmath6 , which implies that the rotational temperature of the line will be extremely low in most relevant cases ( or close to the dust temperature if continuum emission is optically thick ) , even when the 1@xmath15 - 1@xmath4 transition is already collisionally excited ( its einstein coefficient is two orders of magnitude lower ) .",
    "therefore , in order to derive a column density from absorption measurements of the 2@xmath5 - 1@xmath4 line , we can assume that all molecules are in the 1@xmath4 ground level , and that the transition has a low rotational temperature in absence of infrared pumping .",
    "the opacity of the 2@xmath5 - 1@xmath4 line can be written as @xmath41 0.067(n/10@xmath9)(10/@xmath42v)/f@xmath37 , where @xmath42v is the linewidth at half intensity in km s@xmath6 , and n is the column density of o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 in @xmath10 . if n(o - h@xmath0d@xmath1)=10@xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath42v=10 km s@xmath6 , @xmath43(2@xmath5 - 1@xmath4 ) would be 0.024 for t@xmath39=3  k and 0.014 for t@xmath39=30  k respectively . for comparison purposes ,",
    "the opacity of the 1@xmath15 - 1@xmath4 transition at 372 ghz would be 0.024 and 0.006 for t@xmath39=3 and 30  k respectively .",
    "the interpretation of the absorption produced by o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 in sgr  b2 requires knowledge of the rotational temperature of the transition .",

    "1997 , 2006 ; goicoechea et al .",
    "hence , infrared photons cloud play an important role in the pumping of the molecular levels of o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 .",

    "the rotational temperature is 15 and 20 k respectively . in the following we assume t@xmath39=10 - 20 k , and we use these values to derive upper and lower limits to the opacity of the h@xmath0d@xmath1 2@xmath5 - 1@xmath4 line . assuming a linewidth of 10  km  s@xmath6 we obtain @xmath43(2@xmath5 - 1@xmath4)=0.18 and 0.36 for t@xmath39=10 and 20 k respectively .",
    "the corresponding column densities are @xmath12 9@xmath810@xmath9 and 2.3@xmath810@xmath56 @xmath10 , and the abundance of o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 , for a total gas column density of 3@xmath810@xmath45 @xmath10 , is @xmath12 3@xmath810@xmath11 for t@xmath39=10 k and 9@xmath810@xmath11 for t@xmath39=20 k. the latter can be ruled out from the upper limit obtained by pagani et al ( 1992a ) for the emission of the 1@xmath15 - 1@xmath4 line at 372 ghz , n(o - h@xmath0d@xmath1)@xmath311.1@xmath810@xmath56  @xmath10 .",

    "<S> the transition at @xmath2=126.853 @xmath3 m connecting the ground level of o - h@xmath0d@xmath1 , 1@xmath4 , with the the 2@xmath5 level at 113 k , is observed in absorption against the continuum emission of the cold dust of the source . </S>",
    "<S> the line is broad , with a total absorption covering 350  km  s@xmath6 , i.e. , similar to that observed in the fundamental transitions of h@xmath0o , oh and ch at @xmath7179 , 119 and 149 @xmath3 m respectively . for the physical conditions of the different absorbing clouds the h@xmath0d@xmath1 column density ranges from 2 to 5@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 , i.e. , near an order of magnitude below the upper limits obtained from ground based submillimeter telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> the derived h@xmath0d@xmath1 abundance is of a few 10@xmath11 , which agrees with chemical models predictions for a gas at a kinetic temperature of @xmath1220  k. </S>"
