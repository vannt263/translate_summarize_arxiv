    "in contrast , in the strong - coupling limit the coherence length is small , and the bound pairs can be treated as well seperated bose molecules .",
    "one then expects the molecules to undergo bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) into a single quantum state with zero momentum .",
    "the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer(bcs ) theory @xcite and gorkov equations @xcite have been used to estimate gaps in superfluid gases .",
    "however , their predictions differ by more than a factor of two and they may be qualitatively valid only in the weakly interacting regime . here",

    "the fermionic nature of the quantum statistics becomes evident in the measurement of the density profile of the trapped gas . at even lower temperatures",
    "the transition to the superfluid cooper - paired state is expected .",
    "however , the temperature @xmath21 of this transition can be much lower than @xmath22 and conclusive evidence of superfluidity is still to be seen . in order to have the transition at an achievable temperature , the experimentalists rely on the feshbach resonance technique to produce strong interaction between the fermionic atoms .",
