    "we find that for a slow enough cooling rate , that the stability ratio of a system cooled and heated under constant pressure conditions is larger than the stability ratio of a system cooled and heated under constant volume conditions .",
    "we found that we would still need to cool at a rate two orders of magnitude slower to reach the most stable glass formed in simulations , and five orders of magnitude slower to equal the stability of glasses formed in the laboratory by vapor deposition .",
    "we also found that the stability ratio was sensitive not only to the cooling procedure used to create the glass , but the heating procedure used to melt the glass .",
    "therefore , care must be taken in comparing stability ratios obtained by different methods .",
    "one unexpected feature of melting the glass at constant pressure was that the plateau height of the average overlap function was lower for constant pressure , but the relaxation time was longer .",
    "these results suggest that the particles have more room to move , despite having a smaller average volume , but the glass takes longer to melt .",
    "while studying the melting of the glass under constant pressure , we found that the time dependence of the density was a good indicator of the transition time .",
    "monitoring the volume change is a more efficient method to determine the transition time than finding the waiting time when the overlap function has the same decay time as for the equilibrium bulk sample .",
    "future work on simulated glass films should also examine the density change upon melting and examine if there is a heterogeneous density change starting at the surface , and if this density change is related to the melting of stable glasses due to a mobile front initiated at the surface @xcite .",
    "we also examined the average potential energy @xmath27 and the average inherent structure energy @xmath106 for the glasses . both of these quantities are frequently used as indicators of the stability of the glass @xcite , and it has been shown that the particles mobility in a glass forming film is correlated with @xmath112 @xcite . since the two fastest cooling rates for the systems prepared at constant volume and constant pressure had the same stability ratio but different @xmath27 and @xmath106",
    ", we conclude that the stability can not be inferred from these quantities alone .",
    "however , @xmath106 is correlated with the stability ratio if either the glass is prepared and melted and constant volume or constant pressure . to understand the stability of glasses created by simulated vapor deposition , one",
    "would then need to examine the stability of simulated glass films created through vapor deposition , films created at constant zero pressure , and bulk simulations at constant zero pressure .",
    "it is still unclear how the free surface and the substrate are going to influence the calculation of a stability ratio for simulated vapor deposited films ."
