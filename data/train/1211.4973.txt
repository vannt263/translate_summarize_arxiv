    "thermoelectric systems are heat engines which , by using the electron gas formed by their conduction electrons as a working fluid , directly convert a heat flux into electrical power and vice - versa , depending on the desired operation mode . in the linear regime , the coupling between heat and electricity",
    "is embodied in a parameter called thermopower or seebeck coefficient , @xmath0 .",
    "the principal virtues of thermoelectric heat engines are that their conversion efficiency is not size - dependent and that their operation does not rely on moving parts ; the main drawback is their modest energy conversion efficiency , which is at best of the order of 10 % of the efficiency of the ideal carnot thermodynamic cycle .",
    "since the first works reported by seebeck @xcite , oersted @xcite , and peltier @xcite , general interest in thermoelectricity has much varied with time .",
    "some significant milestones in this field are thomson s thermodynamic analysis @xcite , callen s @xcite adaptation of onsager s formalism @xcite , and ioffe s works on device operation @xcite .",
    "in particular ioffe related the thermoelectric conversion efficiency to a dimensionless parameter denoted @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the average temperature across the device and @xmath3 is a parameter that depends on the material s properties , namely the thermopower @xmath0 , and the electrical and thermal conductivities , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively : @xmath6 ( @xmath5 entails both electron and lattice thermal conductivities , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but we neglect the latter throughout the present work since we are mainly interested in the electronic transport properties @xcite ) .",
    "though @xmath1 has a profound meaning on the thermodynamic level , this parameter is much used as a means to measure how well in terms of energy conversion efficiency , a device operates .",
    "a good performance is associated to high values of @xmath1 ( typically around 1 ) .",
    "enhancement of the performance can be obtained following three routes : @xmath9 optimization of the thermoelectric material s properties @xcite ; @xmath10 optimization of device working conditions through appropriate design @xcite and electrical and thermal impedance matchings @xcite ; and @xmath11 design of new nano- and mesostructures @xcite . the first route , which essentially consists of finding means to decrease @xmath5 and increase @xmath4 has produced a number of very interesting results , but further significant progress seems out of reach @xcite , one of the difficulties being that both @xmath4 and the electronic part @xmath7 of the thermal conductivity @xmath5 are tightly linked ; this link is the wiedemann - franz law for metals @xcite .",
    "the second line of work is based on the observation that the highest performances are usually obtained in a very limited temperature range for a given material , so that devices must be designed in such a way that they may operate over a large temperature range , which is usually achieved by segmentation ; in addition , when seeking maximum efficiency at maximum output power for a thermoelectric generator , one should ensure that the conditions for both thermal and electrical impedance matchings are fulfilled .",
    "the third route , which we explore in this paper , was permitted thanks to the rapid and tremendous progress in the field of fabrication of nano- and mesoscopic artificial structures .",
    "the interest of going down to such scales stems from a number of effects that truly enrich the physics of thermoelectricity and pave the way to possibly better device performance ; we can mention quantum confinement @xcite and the related modification of the carriers density of states , mesoscopic fluctuations , breakdown of the fermi liquid picture @xcite , and limits of validity of standard thermodynamic approaches due to finite - size effects .",
    "further , since for macroscopic systems an increase of thermopower impacts on the values of thermal and electrical conductivities and may not necessarily result in a significant increase of @xmath1 , it is also interesting to see how at the mesoscopic level the quantum effects pertaining to electron confinement and quantization of the transport coefficients @xcite may modify the interplay between @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we see how to achieve high figures of merit with systems having large thermopower and low thermal conductivity at the same time .",
    "we focuse on a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system in the presence of off - channel cavities , which perturb the electrical conductivity @xmath4 or , equivalently , the energy - dependent transmission function @xmath12 .",
    "this system may be fabricated from structures which contain two - dimensional electron gases .",
    "the main property of the mesoscopic system we study is the cancellation of the transmission function at a given energy we may choose and vary using an external gate ; other characteristics are described in section 2 .",
    "now , the main idea underlying the present work comes from the cutler - mott formula @xcite , which gives the seebeck coefficient at low temperature :    @xmath13    where the derivative of the electrical conductivity is taken at the fermi energy @xmath14 .",
    "equation which is valid for metallic systems such as that under consideration in this paper , shows that when the transmission vanishes , the seebeck coefficient tends to infinity . in general ,",
    "when the transmission vanishes , the derivative @xmath15 vanishes too , but in virtue of lhopital s rule , we know that the limit does diverge .",
    "therefore , if the conduction band contains a transmission - cancelling energy level , the coupling between heat and electrical fluxes is enhanced in the vicinity of this energy , which in turn may yield a significant increase of the figure of merit @xmath1 .    as will become obvious with the definitions of the transport coefficients given further below",
    ", a symmetric transmission function would tend to cancel the contributions from higher and lower energy terms with respect to the fermi level , and hinder transport , so we seek configurations that makes the transmission function profile asymmetric .",
    "indeed , the transmission function should be asymmetric around the fermi energy so that the hot - reservoir electrons may leave their high energy states and proceed against the applied source - drain bias through the waveguide to the cold reservoir s available states as noted in ref .  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we investigate the effects of electron - phonon coupling on the transmission profile , and see whether this coupling impacts positively on the transport coefficients and figure of merit .",
    "our phenomenological model is based on a number of assumptions .",
    "first , our main framework is that of single - particle theory so that the ballistic electron transport in the waveguide may be described by a single - band effective mass hamiltonian .",
    "we consider the linear response only , which implies that the temperature gradient across the system is small ; incidently this assumption provides a small energy scale for the model .",
    "the temperature @xmath2 is sufficiently small so that the cutler - mott formula remains valid .",
    "effects of the couplings of the waveguide to the off - channel cavities and the phonons are studied with the nonequilibrium green s function approach @xcite , adapting to our purposes recent works on dephasing effects on quantum transport @xcite .",
    "we assume that the system operates in a steady - state regime , and that the two reservoirs , to which the electron waveguide is connected , are perfect .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath14 in the whole system is given by the highest level occupied by an electron in either reservoirs at zero temperature .",
    "the phonons are assumed to be in equilibrium .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present in detail the basic system under consideration .",
    "the system hamiltonian , the thermoelectric transport coefficients and the transmission function are defined and discussed considering the presence of only one off - channel cavity coupled to one site of the lattice . in section iii , we introduce the effects of the coupling of parts of the 1d lattice to a bath of dephasing phonons ; for this , we redefine our basic chain model using a decimation procedure . in section iv , we study the response of the system s thermoelectric transport coefficients to the presence of an additional off - channel cavity .",
    "the article ends on concluding remarks , followed by the appendix where some detail on the calculation of the self - energies using the decimation procedure is given .",
    "we consider a 1d electron waveguide , which we describe as a 1d lattice ; electron conduction is characterized by hopping between the lattice sites .",
    "the waveguide is connected first to one off - channel cavity by coupling to one of the lattice sites .",
    "we also assume a small cavity size so that it contains only one energy level accessible to the conduction electrons @xcite and , in the absence of the off - channel cavity , the system is uniform and has full transmission : @xmath16 , at any fermi energy .",
    "the cavity is controlled by external gates which handle its coupling to the electron waveguide and its shape as shown in fig .",
    "[ cavity ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written in a tight binding model as the sum of three contributions :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the electron waveguide hamiltonian , which describes the transport of an electron from @xmath19 to @xmath20 in the absence of the off - channel cavity :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is a wannier state at location @xmath23 along the 1d lattice , and @xmath24 is the hopping coefficient , which we take as : @xmath25 in the effective mass approximation ( @xmath26 is the electron effective mass , and @xmath27 the lattice spacing ) .",
    "the energy @xmath28 is that of the site at the center of lattice ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the dispersion relation derived from the hamiltonian @xmath18 reads @xmath30 , leading to a conduction band @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "the term @xmath32 characterizes the off - channel cavity with a single level :    @xmath33    where the energy @xmath34 of the state @xmath35 can be controlled by an external gate .",
    "the term @xmath36 characterizes the coupling between the cavity and the site at the center of the electron waveguide to which it is coupled :    @xmath37    where the coupling parameter is noted @xmath38 .",
    "this simple model may represent a multilevel quantum dot when the level spacing is large compared to the range of energies contributing to the transport due to temperature smearing . in all that follows ,",
    "the hopping coefficient in the leads is taken as @xmath39 such that all the energies in our study are expressed in the units of @xmath24 .",
    "we consider three transport coefficients : the electrical conductivity @xmath4 , the thermopower @xmath0 , and the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath40 , which is related to the zero - electric - current thermal conductivity @xmath7 _ via _ :    @xmath41    these three coefficients are given by the solutions of the boltzmann equation @xcite :    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the electrochemical potential of the electron system .",
    "the conductivity @xmath4 is expressed in units of @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the planck constant , and @xmath48 being the electron charge .",
    "the important quantity that determines all the necessary physical quantities for our work is the transmission function @xmath49 .",
    "knowledge of the three transport coefficients thus permits an analysis of the figure of merit @xmath1 , which for a standard system where heat is transported by electrons and the lattice , may be rewritten as :    @xmath50    note that in the present work , we focuse on the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath40 because the 1d system is made from 2d electronic gases .",
    "so the figure of merit we compute and analyze in this article is the electronic part of @xmath1 given in eq .  , neglecting the contribution of @xmath8 .",

    "( [ seebeck ] ) : since @xmath51 changes sign around the fermi energy , a symmetric transmission function would yield cancellation . also note that @xmath51 corresponds to the heat involved in the transport process , so a high energy conversion efficiency may be obtained on the conditions that the transmission profile permits a high eletrical flux from hot to cold reservoirs with a minimal heat flux",

    "[ figtransmission ] .",
    "we notice that the presence of the cavity changes drastically the profile of the transmission and it even leads to its cancellation , which can be viewed as a quantum destructive interference .",
    "the value at which this cancellation appears is directly obtained from the transmission function , in eq .   : as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and the width of the antiresonance is controlled by the coupling parameter @xmath38 .",
    "a first - order expansion near the energy @xmath69 shows that the transmission function is parabolic :    @xmath70    and it becomes clear that the weaker the coupling to the cavity is ( @xmath71 ) the sharper the antiresonance is . to recover the full transmission of the system ( as without the cavity ) one may increase the potential @xmath34 to infinity , since this implies that the cavity region becomes forbidden to the electrons moving across the waveguide . decreasing the coupling @xmath38 down to @xmath72",
    "makes the antiresonance narrower but does not eliminate it ; and setting @xmath73 is a rather abrupt way to take the cavity off .",
    "we just saw the effects of the coupling parameter @xmath38 and the cavity level @xmath34 on the transmission function , and clearly they have no influence on the symmetry of the profile . in order to induce some asymmetry",
    "we need to introduce an additional physical process , hence a new parameter . in what follows",
    ", we allow the electrons that flow through the waveguide to interact with phonons within two small regions located on both sides of the site coupled to the cavity .",
    "in this section , to study the effects of electron - phonon interaction on the transport coefficients , we consider the presence of external phonon baths symmetrically located on both sides of the cavity and connected to @xmath74 sites .",

    "the description of the new situation is done using a decimation procedure , which is described further below .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we make approximations to perform tractable calculations : we assume that the phonons , which form a bath of independent oscillators , are in equilibrium ; we consider only one - phonon scattering processes ( self - consistent born approximation ) ; the electron - phonon interaction is local and has no effect on the hopping coefficient @xcite .",
    "further , we simplify our analysis by considering single - mode phonons , with energy @xmath75 .",
    "the phonon - electron interaction hamiltonian thus assumes a simple form and reads :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively are the second - quantized phonon creation and annihilation operators , and @xmath79 is the electron - phonon interaction strength considered here as site - independent .",
    "the approach to access the transmission function through the device in the presence of dephasing phonons starts with expressing the retarded ( advanced ) and lesser ( greater ) self energies as done in refs .",
    "these quantities are obtained in a closed form within the self - consistent born approximation  @xcite , which ensures current conservation @xcite .      to simplify the description of the system connected to the phonon baths on both sides of the central site , which is connected to the off - channel cavity",

    "[ graphdecimation]@xmath80 and [ graphdecimation]@xmath81 : the red sites are connected to the phonon baths , and the green site is at the energy level of the off - channel cavity ; the system thus is formed of two parts : the interacting region connected on its left and right sides to semi - infinite perfect 1d leads .",
    "the decimation consists in taking out the central part ( five grey sites and the green one ) , and renormalizing the sites ( and their links ) to which it was attached .",
    "the renormalized sites are shown in blue .",
    "this procedure is exact in the sense that both systems @xmath80 and @xmath81 are equivalent for transmission since they share the same green s function submatrix related to the remaining sites .",
    "the sites are renormalized as follows : we note @xmath47 the hamiltonian of the part we take out and we define the green s function @xmath82 ; then the hamiltonian of the sites directly coupled to the removed part is :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the new hamiltonian of the renormalized sites ( a sub - hamiltonian of the total one ) , @xmath85 is the hamiltonian of these sites in the absence of coupling to the central part , and @xmath86 is the coupling matrix between the central part and its surrounding sites ( @xmath87 is its complex conjugate ) . equation ( [ decimationeq ] ) clearly shows that the hamiltonian @xmath84 is energy - dependent , and we recognize the form of a self - energy : @xmath88 .",
    "actually the decimation procedure may be seen as the use of the concept of self - energy in the formalism of landauer - buttikker to take into account the effects of the reservoirs , or infinite leads ( an application of such procedure may also be found in refs .",

    "the aim of the decimation procedure is to lower the dimension of the green s matrix since it is numerically obtained using a recursive algorithm .",
    "another interest of this procedure is that it simplifies the equations describing the phonon self - energy @xmath89 , entering the definition of the retarded green s function :    @xmath90    where , after application of the decimation procedure , the hamiltonian @xmath91 takes the form of an @xmath92 matrix .",
    "the leads are characterized by their self - energy matrix @xmath93 , which has only two nonzero elements : @xmath94 .",
    "the phonon self - energy is more complicated and it is obtained self - consistently with the green s function . within the born approximation and the assumption that the effect of the phonons is local ( their effect is restricted on single sites and does not change the hopping coefficients ) the phonon self - energy reads :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is a superoperator whose application to a matrix sets all its elements , except the diagonal ones , to zero , thus returning a diagonal matrix @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 characterizes the coupling between the phonon baths and the system , hence the dephasing process .",

    "the behavior of the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath7 is similar for the same reasons .    both profiles of thermopower @xmath0 as functions of temperature @xmath2 show an extremum .",

    "this change of sign for the thermopower could also be anticipated from the formula .",
    "recall that this asymmetry is due to the modulation created by the two electron - phonon interacting regions .",
    "note that while the values of the figure of merit @xmath1 are modest in both cases , their shapes indicate that with appropriate adjustments of the location energy ( which corresponds to the peak ) and passband , very interesting developments are possible since the energy spectrum of the thermoelectric system is tunable .",
    "indeed , this is a key point as regards the thermodynamic coupling of the system to its environment or other systems : minimization of the mismatch of the respective energy spectra of two systems permits a lowering of entropy production as these two systems get coupled ( this is well known in the case of monochromatic photons interacting with a black body @xcite ) .",

    "we showed how to obtain a strongly asymmetric shape for the transmission function : first by coupling parts of the waveguide connected to an off - channel cavity to phonons , and then by coupling this system to an additional off - channel cavity . in our case ,",
    "the transmission profile is characterized by oscillations , which trigger changes of sign of the thermopower as the location of the antiresonance of the transmission function corresponds either to a minimum or a maximum of these oscillations around the fermi energy .",
    "this sign change shows that the system acts as an energy - selective filter : low - energy electrons in the vicinity of the fermi level are not transmitted ( the case of positive thermopower ) , and the higher - energy electrons are not transmitted ( the case of negative thermopower ) .",
    "as the transmission function vanishes we observe an enhancement of the thermoeletric coefficients .",
    "this result is in accordance with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a strong enhancement of thermoelectric coefficients due to coulomb correlations and destructive interference effects ( hence vanishing of transmission ) was found in a double quantum dot system .",
    "it is also interesting to see that while an enhancement of @xmath1 was found for transmission profiles that exhibit a sharp antiresonance , a significant enhancement is also found for a narrow transmission resonance @xcite , which is the opposite configuration .",
    "to some extent , this recalls babinet s principle in optics .",
    "finally , as pointed out in the introduction , from a thermodynamic viewpoint a thermoelectric system is a thermal engine to which a @xmath1-dependent energy conversion efficiency is associated .",
    "recently some aspects of the question of efficiency at maximum power of low - dimensional thermoelectric systems have been discussed in terms of performance for quantum dots and 1d ballistic conductors @xcite .",
    "these works pertain to the more general framework of finite - time thermodynamics @xcite , a field which contains a number of interesting open questions at the macroscopic level @xcite , which must also be addressed at the mesoscopic level ; these questions are related to the location of irreversibility sources in the system as a whole and the impact on the efficiency at maximum power , two particular cases being those of endoreversible and exoreversible engines .",
    "the question of irreversibility at the mesoscopic level is certainly not trivial since this requires a careful characterization of the coupling of a system to its environment .",
    "we are pleased to thank y. apertet for a careful reading of the manuscript and insightful comments .",
    "this work was supported by a grant from the rgion basse normandie .",
    "we also acknowledge partial funding from the labex emc3 .",
    "as an example , we give the matrices defining the green s function for the model presented in fig .",
    "[ graphdecimation ] .",
    "first we define the hamiltonian @xmath47 of the part we want to take out :      where the diagonal elements @xmath133 represent the potentials on the sites of the central part including the cavity level , and the off - diagonal elements @xmath134 show if site @xmath135 is connected to site @xmath136 and with which strength .    to perform the decimation procedure ,",
    "we take out this part and renormalize the sites to which it was attached .",
    "we first express the green s function @xmath82 .",
    "after decimation , we obtain the system shown in fig .",
