    "observations of both cool and hot intergalactic gas make it clear that heavy elements are by no means confined to galaxies .",
    "larson ( 1974 ) predicted that late in the galaxy formation process , galactic winds would carry heavy elements out into intergalactic space .",
    "soon afterwards x - ray spectra of intracluster gas confirmed that the gas was quite metal - rich . in recent years observations of absorption lines in qso spectra",
    "have elucidated the impact of supernovae on the diffuser gas that is found in the field , at least at high redshift .",
    "these observations imply that , from a redshift @xmath1 onwards , there does not seem to be a parcel of gas that has not felt the impact of spernovae , probably mediated by galactic winds .    while the ubiquity of the products of supernovae is beyond doubt , many aspects of the interaction of supernovae and intergalactic gas are highly uncertain .",
    "outstanding questions include : ( i ) in what types of galaxy were intergalactic metals manufactured ?",
    "( ii ) which type of supernova ( core - collapse or ia ) has been most important , and at what epoch ? ( iii )",
    "how important have supernovae been for the entropy budget of intergalactic gas ?",
    "most of the luminosity in the universe comes from spiral galaxies like the milky way .",
    "do such galaxies blow sn - driven winds ?    studies of the local ism show that a significant fraction of the pressure in the ism comes from cosmic - rays and the magnetic field .",
    "supernovae and fast stellar winds are the main energy sources of the ism , so the dynamical importance of cosmic rays and magnetic fields suggests that a significant fraction of the kinetic energy which these objects pump into the ism is chanelled into cosmic rays and magnetic fields .",
    "hence , assuming there to be @xmath2 supernova per century , the cosmic - ray reservoir is being energized at a rate @xmath3 .",
    "how does this power , which could build up the observed interstellar pressure within a disk @xmath4 in radius and @xmath5 thick within @xmath6 , manifest itself ?",
    "the local cosmic - ray energy spectrum is such that the energy is overwhelmingly contained in only mildly relativistic particles .",
    "such particles have enormous lifetimes because they are too fast to suffer much coulomb scattering and too slow to produce significant synchrotron radiation  which explains why the non - thermal radio luminosity of galaxies like the milky way is @xmath7 ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "hence , the energy imparted by spernovae can not be radiated either directly or by transfer to thermal particles , and is not simply building up within the disk .",
    "so it must drive expansion of the cosmic - ray plasma : the milky way must be blowing a wind that is working on the local igm at a rate @xmath8 .",
    "what volume within the local group would this wind have filled to the present epoch ? there are two ways of answering this question .",
    "if the wind were expanding into a vacuum , it would expand at @xmath9 and extend to @xmath10 in a hubble time .",
    "this gives us an upper limit on the radius of influence of an @xmath11 galaxy .",
    "a lower limit comes from assuming that the extragalactic baryons that are required by primordial nucleosynthesis theory were once distributed in galactic halos like dark matter , and the sn - driven wind raised its temperature by of order the virial temperature .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 and @xmath13 , so with baryons following dark matter in a singular - isothermal halo of circular speed @xmath14 , the baryonic mass interior to radius @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 . equating the energy required to heat this material by the virial temperature to the time - integral of the sn - power , we find , so",
    "@xmath17 is independent of @xmath14 . ]",
    "@xmath18 we see that even the present supernova rate within the milky way would impact the igm out to near the mid point to m31 , and in reality the sn rate has almost certainly been substantially larger in the past .",
    "recently , tripp , savage & jenkins ( 2000 ) have suggested that o@xmath19 absorption in quasar spectra points to a major reservoir of baryons in warm ( @xmath20k ) gas in galaxy groups . as pen ( 1999 ) points out , the thermal energy of this gas can not derive from gravity alone : without non - gravitational heating it would be so clumpy that its soft x - ray emission would violate the constraint imposed by the unresolved component of the x - ray background .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that galactic winds provide the required heat source ( see below ) .",
    "the most compelling evidence for the impact of supernovae comes from rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "arnaud et al ( 1992 ) show that for these objects gas mass and @xmath21-band luminosity are highly correlated  @xmath22 . at least in part",
    "the steepness of this correlation will arise for two reasons .",
    "first , more luminous clusters tend to have higher frations of early - type galaxies , which have lower @xmath23 per unit stellar mass , @xmath24 .",
    "second , lower - luminosity clusters are less likely to attract infall , and more likely to suffer outflow of gas  renzini ( 1997 ) finds that systems with temperature in excess of @xmath25 do not lose gas .",
    "arnaud et al .",
    "note that @xmath26 is as tightly correlated with the luminosity from e and s0 galaxies as with total luminosity : @xmath27 and argue that the exponent in this relation can be taken to be unity , so that with @xmath28 for early type galaxies set to @xmath29 , @xmath30    from the fact that @xmath31 it is clear that much of the igm has never been in a galaxy .",
    "while the bulk of the gas may be primordial , the heavy elements in it are most certainly not . with @xmath29 the estimate of arnaud et al .",
    "( 1992 ) becomes @xmath32 while renzini ( 1997 ) finds that for clusters hotter than @xmath33 @xmath34 independent of cluster temperature .",
    "again adopting @xmath29 , renzini s value of the fe abundance becomes @xmath35 the igm - abundances of several @xmath36-elements , o , ne , mg , and especially si , have been determined for many clusters ( mushotzky et al .",
    "when meteoric rather than solar - photospheric abundances are used as a point of reference , the igm proves to be only mildly @xmath36-enhanced  by a factor @xmath37 relative to solar ( brighenti & mathews , 1999 ) .    what does nucleosynthesis theory have to say about these mass fractions ?",
    "the picture is confused by uncertainties in the yields of fe and to a certain extent si , from core - collapse sne , and the rates ( current and past ) of type ia sne .    a key input into nucleosynthetic theory is the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "i shall assume that for @xmath38 this is of salpeter s form , since there is now significant evidence that the imf is universal ( which is surprising ) and lies near salpeter s form at larger masses .",
    "in particular , recent work based on hipparcos parallaxes ( binney , dehnen & bertelli , 2000 ) does not support the contention of scalo ( 1986 ) that the local imf is steeper than salpeter at @xmath38 , while kennicut , tamblyn & congdon ( 1994 ) argue that measurements of h@xmath36 fluxes from external disks rule out a steep imf .    for a salpeter imf extending between @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "we expect 0.0068 core - collapse sne per m@xmath41 of star formation , and @xmath42 of the initial stellar mass would by now have been returned to the ism .",
    "the average core - collapse sn is expected to inject @xmath43 of si and @xmath44 of fe into the ism ( gibson , loewenstein & mushotzky , 1997 ) , so from core - collapse sne we expect @xmath45 of si and @xmath46 of fe , where @xmath47 is the mass in stars before the onset of mass loss .",
    "these masses fall short of those observed [ eqs  ( [ mfea ] and ( [ mfer ] ) ] by a factor of order 2 .",
    "the calculation ignores the existence of intergalactic stars ( mendez et al . , 1996 ) , but it also ignores the retention of heavy elements within galaxies . in practice these two omissions will roughly cancel , and a more elaborate calculation would leave us significantly short of heavy elements .",
    "the resolution of this shortfall is controversial .",
    "some argue for a flatter than salpeter imf ( david , 1997 ; gibson et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "others argue that the missing heavies were produced by type ia supernovae ( renzini et al . , 1993 ;",
    "ishimaru & arimoto , 1997 )  after all more than half of the fe in the solar neighbourhood is thought to come from type ia sne .",
    "a type ia sn injects @xmath48 of si and @xmath49 of fe into the ism ( thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto , 1993 ) , so these objects inject four times as much fe as si , whereas core - collapse sne inject at least as much si as fe .",
    "consequently , the observed ratio of si to fe masses in the igm ( @xmath50 ) constrains the importance of type ia sne .",
    "the big problem with imposing this constraint at the present time is uncertainty in the ratio of mean yields of si and fe from core - collapse suprnovae : if as , is perfectly plausible , core - collapse supernovae produce significantly less fe than si , one will need a good number of type ia sne to bring the overall ratio @xmath51 down to @xmath50 as observed .",
    "the current rate of type ia sne can in principle be determined in two ways : ( i ) direct observation ( with still depressingly uncertain results ) , and ( ii ) from models of isolated elliptical galaxies , which require the heating rate to decline towards the current epoch in such a way that galaxies of appropriate luminosity and ambient igm pressure are now suffering cooling catastrophes in increasing numbers ( loewenstein & mathews , 1987 ; ciotti et al . , 1991 ; binney & tabor , 1995 ) . the rates in times past , which will surely differ from the present one , are well - nigh impossible to determine or predict .",
    "if rich clusters were fashioned by gravity alone , they should evolve self - similarly .",
    "kaiser ( 1991 ) pointed out that it is then almost inevitable that there should be more x - ray luminous clusters in the past than now .",
    "this conclusion follows because the luminosity of an individual cluster scales as the product @xmath52 of mass times density , and with @xmath53 the usual spectral index of the primoridial fluctuations , @xmath54 for @xmath55 , while @xmath56 , so the characteristic luminosity will be roughly independent of @xmath57 .",
    "the number density of freshly collapsed objects will , on the other hand , be much higher at high @xmath57 .",
    "hence there should have been many more luminous clusters in the past , in contradiction with observation .",
    "the obvious way of suppressing the x - ray luminosities of early clusters is to have them form from preheated gas , which will either not be trapped by early potential wells , or will be trapped at lower density than in the unheated case .",
    "kaiser estimates the entropy boost required by observing that the gas density at the core of a rich cluster is about @xmath58 times the current mean density , or the mean density at @xmath59 .",
    "so we could get the gas onto the required adiabat by heating it to current cluster temperatures @xmath60k at @xmath59 .",
    "alternatively , we could heat it to @xmath61 ^ 210^{7.5}\\,$]k at redshift @xmath62 .    pen",
    "s lower limit on the entropy of gas in groups that was discussed above implies a similar energy budget .",
    "the current maximum density of the gas is only an order - of - magnitude greater than the current cosmic mean density , so two order of magnitude smaller than the maximum density of cluster gas , and the temperature would be at @xmath63k an order - of magnitude lower than the temperature of cluster gas .",
    "so the gas would be on a slightly higher adiabat .",
    "on the other hand , it could be put onto that adiabat rather later and therefore at a smaller cost in energy .",
    "do sne provide the requisite energy ?",
    "the energy release per cosmic baryon is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of baryons per unit mass , @xmath66 is the energy and @xmath67 is the mass of iron produced by a single sn . since core - collapse sne produce the least fe per unit energy , we will maximize the energy release per fe nucleus synthesized if we assume that type ia sne are unimportant . using equations ( [ mgas ] ) and ( [ mfer ] ) to evaluate equation ( [ esn ] ) under this assumption , and then equating the result to the thermal energy per baryon , @xmath68 , of a plasma of molecular weight @xmath69 , we find the plasma temperature to be @xmath70 this is clearly an upper limit on the achievable temperature because it is assumes core - collapse sne to be dominant while ignoring radiative losses , which are liable to be significant for many core - collapse sne , because they tend to go off in dense gas clouds .",
    "my judgment is that the enegy budget is too tight , even if we assume that the gas is heated as late as @xmath71 , but others may disagree .",
    "agn are strong candidates for providing the energy if sne can not do the job ( begelman , this volume ) .",
    "as one moves down the mass scale through virial temperatures below @xmath72 , the ratio of gas mass to stellar mass declines ( renzini , 1997 ) .",
    "one interpretation of this result is ( binney , 1980 ; whitmore , gilmore & jones , 1993 ) that intracluster gas is the material from which disks are formed in the field , and that its early enrichment to @xmath73 by early - type galaxies is the counterpart of the pre - enrichment of the galactic disk by the bulge , which ostriker & thuan ( 1975 ) argued is the correct solution of the g - dwarf problem . whereas in rich clusters",
    "late - infalling , high angular - momentum gas was shocked to the virial temperature before it could form an accretion disk around a spheroid , in systems like the local group disks did form , and the floor metallicity , @xmath73 , mirrors the current metallicity of intracluster gas . in this picture , the declining fraction of mass in the igm as one moves to poorer and poorer clusters simply reflects the fact that a larger and larger fraction of the original igm has settled into disks .    the argument i have given that star - forming @xmath11 galaxies blow powerful winds suggests that all @xmath11 galaxies , cluster and field alike , lose most of their heavy elements into deep space .",
    "if this is so , conventional galaxy evolution models require substantial revision",
    ". moreover , in this picture overwhelming quantities of metal - enriched baryons are stored in deep space .",
    "more than one tentative line of argument now suggests that this is indeed the case . within a few years",
    "we will probably know for sure ."
