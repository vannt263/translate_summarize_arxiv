    "the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) observed e0102 - 72 for a total of @xmath0140  ksec with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) in the optical path of the telescope .",
    "the hetgs contains two types of gratings , the high and medium energy gratings ( heg & meg ) .",
    "these gratings provide an e/@xmath8e of 100 - 1000 for point sources over the energy range of 0.4 - 10 kev .",
    "the heg and meg are rotated with respect to each other so that the dispersed spectra form an `` x '' pattern on the detector .",
    "the problem of overlapping orders is resolved using the moderate energy resolution of the acis detector .",
    "additional details of the analysis and results can be found in these proceedings @xcite@xcite .",
    "here we present results from the meg spectrum of e0102 - 72 .",
    "we extracted the line fluxes using an annular aperture that encloses the observed ring .",
    "the background was taken from an annular region outside the dispersed image of interest but with the same center as the region for the line flux .",
    "figure 1 shows the dispersed image of the snr in the o viii ly@xmath2 line ( 18.97   ) . while the overall shape of the remnant can be described as a ring it is clear that this is not true on small scales .",
    "the ring has gaps on the eastern side and a bright knot can be seen in the southwest quadrant .",
    "the image of the snr in the ne x ly@xmath2 line ( 12.13  ) is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the ne x image shows fewer gaps in the rim than the o viii image , but like the oxygen image shows deviations from a ring structure .",
    "we find no evidence that the different elements are stratified .",
    "however , we do find ionization structure in the remnant @xcite . despite these complexities",
    "a global analysis is useful as it allows us to determine integrated line fluxes for comparison with @xmath9 and @xmath10 results , and to compare our models with earlier results .",
    "line ratios were calculated for pairs of hydrogen - like and helium - like lines and these are compared to the nei model in xspec 11 . here",
    "we present results ( table 1 ) for the flux ratio of ions from the same element so that the results are independent of the abundances .",
    "we use the column density of 8.0@xmath1110@xmath12 atoms  @xmath13 @xcite to correct the flux for interstellar absorption .",
    "we derive tight constrains of the physical state of the plasma from measurements of o viii ly@xmath3/o viii ly@xmath2 and from the ratio of o vii forbidden + ic to o vii resonance . using figure 3",
    "we find that the temperature must be above @xmath00.68 kev and log(@xmath7 ) is between 9.85 and 10.05 s @xmath5 .",
    "the ratios of ne x ly@xmath2 to ne ix res along with ne x ly@xmath3/ne x ly@xmath2 also provide tight constraints on the physical state of the plasma .",
    "they do not overlap the allowed region for oxygen .",
    "the allowed region of parameter space is shown in figure 4 ; the width of the regions is determined by the three @xmath14 limits on the line ratios .",
    "the lower limit on the temperature of the plasma is 0.54 kev from the oxygen ratio and 0.97 kev from the neon ratio and is consistent with the @xmath9 analysis of this remnant @xcite .",
    "the lower limits for the temperature are robust even for a multi-@xmath7 plasma .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.1 cm table 1 : the flux ratios for oxygen and neon .",
    "we have measured the strong emission lines of o and ne in the snr e0102 - 72 .",
    "the detected flux ratios from these lines are consistent with emission from a young snr that has not yet reached ionization equilibrium .",
    "our global analysis yields an electron temperature that is above @xmath0 0.54 kev and an ionization age between 9.85 @xmath15 log(@xmath7 ) @xmath15 10.6 , consistent with this being a young remnant .",
    "we find that the line emission from each element , measured globally , can be described by an nei plasma using a simple plane parallel shock model .",
    "our analysis is consistent with the oxygen and neon emission both being from the reverse shock and we find no compelling evidence that oxygen and neon are not well mixed .",
    "future work will include analysis of other lines present in this spectrum .",
    "we also will use the imaging capability of the hetgs to explore how the plasma diagnostics vary around e0102 - 72 and map the temperature and ionization age of this remnant .",
