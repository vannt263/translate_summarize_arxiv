    "as an emerging candidate for 5 g wireless communication networks , massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) @xcite has drawn a lot of research interests recently . however , there are only a few works on physical layer security in this area @xcite . among the very few ,",
    "only some of them have studied jamming aspects although jamming exists and has been identified as a critical problem for reliable communications , especially in massive mimo systems , which are sensitive to pilot contamination @xcite .",
    "for instance , the authors consider security transmission for a downlink massive mimo system with presence of attackers capable of jamming and eavesdropping in @xcite . the problem of smart jamming is considered for an uplink massive mimo system in @xcite , which shows that a smart jammer can cause pilot contamination that substantially degrades the system performance .",
    "most of the above works have been considered from a jammer point of view : study the jamming strategy , which is the most harmful for the legitimate user or for the eavesdropper . in this work ,",
    "we motivate our study from the system perspective , in which we develop counter strategies to minimize the effect of jamming attacks . to this end",
    ", we first derive an achievable rate of a single user uplink massive mimo with the presence of a jammer .",
    "then , by exploiting asymptotic properties of massive mimo systems , we propose two anti - jamming strategies based on pilot retransmission protocols for the cases of random jamming and deterministic jamming attacks .",
    "numerical results show that the proposed anti - jamming strategies can significantly improve the system performance .",
    "we consider a single user massive mimo uplink with the presence of a jammer as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_model ] .",
    "further , we assume that the base station ( bs ) has @xmath0 antennas , the legitimate user and the jammer have a single antenna .    [ ] [ ] [ 0.7]@xmath1 [ ] [ ] [ 0.7]@xmath2 [ ] [ ] [ 0.7]@xmath3 [ ] [ ] [ 0.9]@xmath4 [ ] [ ] [ 0.9]@xmath5     let us denote @xmath6 and @xmath7 as the channel vectors from the user and the jammer to the bs , respectively .",
    "we assume that the elements of @xmath8 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero mean circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( zmcscg ) random variables , i.e. , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 represents the large - scale fading ( path loss and shadowing ) .",
    "similarly , we assume that @xmath11 and is independent of @xmath8 .",
    "we consider a block - fading model , in which the channel remains constant during a coherence block of @xmath12 symbols , and varies independently from one coherence block to the next . to communicate with the bs",
    ", the legitimate user follows a two - phase tdd transmission protocol : i ) phase 1 : the user sends pilot sequences to the bs for channel estimation , and ii ) phase 2 : the user transmits the payload data to the bs .",
    "we assume that the jammer attacks the uplink transmission both in the training and in the data payload transmission phases .      during",
    "the first @xmath13 channel uses ( @xmath14 ) , the user sends to the bs a pilot sequence @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the transmit pilot power and @xmath17 originates from a pilot codebook @xmath18 containing @xmath13 orthogonal unit - power vectors . at the same time",
    ", the jammer sends @xmath19 to interfere the channel estimation , where @xmath20 satisfies @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the transmit power of the jammer during the training phase .",
    "accordingly , the received signals at the bs is given by [ ytm ] _",
    "t=__^t+__^t+_t , where @xmath23 is the additive noise matrix with unit power i.i.d .",
    "zmcscg elements .",
    "the bs then performs a de - spreading operation as : [ yt ] _",
    "t=_t_^ * = _ + _ _ ^t _ ^ * + _ t , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) estimate of @xmath8 given @xmath26 is @xcite [ guh ] _ = c__t , where @xmath27 .",
    "the mmse estimator ( [ guh ] ) requires that the bs has to know @xmath10 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath28 are large - scale fading coefficients which change very slowly with time ( some @xmath30 times slower than the small - scale fading coefficients ) , they can be estimated at the bs easily @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 includes the jamming sequence @xmath31 which is unknown at the bs .",
    "however , by exploiting asymptotic properties of the massive mimo , the bs can estimate @xmath29 from the received pilot signal @xmath32 .",
    "we will discuss about this in detail in section  [ sec : mp ] .",
    "let @xmath33 be the channel estimation error . from the properties of mmse estimation , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are independent .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where [ gamu ] _ = c__.      during the last @xmath38 channel uses , the user transmits the payload data to the bs and the jammer continues to interfere with its jamming signal . let @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) be the transmitted signals from the user and the jammer , respectively .",
    "the bs receives _",
    "x_+_d , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the transmit powers from the user and jammer in the data transmission phase , respectively .",
    "the noise vector @xmath45 is assumed to have i.i.d .",
    "@xmath46 elements .",
    "to estimate @xmath39 , the bs performs the maximal ratio combining based on the estimated channel @xmath34 as follow [ y ] y=_^h_d = _ ^h_x_+ _ ^h_x_+ _ ^h_d .",
    "in order to analyze the impact of jamming attack on the system , we derive a capacity lower bound ( achievable rate ) for the massive mimo channel , described as in ( [ y ] ) . substituting @xmath47 into ( [ y ] ) , we have [ yb ] y=_^2x_+ _ ^h_x_+ _ ^h_x_+ _ ^h_d .",
    "since @xmath48 consists of the signals associated with the channel uncertainty and jamming , we derive an achievable rate using the method suggested in @xcite . to this end",
    ", we decompose the received signal in ( [ yb ] ) as [ yc ] & & y=\\{_^2}x_+ + & & _",
    "n _   -     since @xmath49 and the desired signal are uncorrelated , we can obtain an achievable rate by treating @xmath49 as the worst - case gaussian noise , which can be characterized as follows .",
    "[ pro ] an achievable rate of the massive mimo channel with jamming is [ r ] r=(1-/t)_2(1 + ) , where @xmath50 is the effective sinr , given by [ rho ] = .",
    "see appendix  [ pro1proof ] .",
    "two interesting remarks can be made :    * if the jammer does not attack during the training phase ( @xmath51 ) or @xmath31 and @xmath52 are orthogonal ( @xmath53 ) , the achievable rate becomes [ r_barj ] r & = & ( 1-)_2(1 + ) ^m .",
    "the achievable rate increases without bound as @xmath54 , even when the jammer attacks during the data transmission phase . *",
    "if the jammer attacks during the training phase and @xmath55 , we have r ^m & & ( 1-)_2 ( ) .",
    "this implies that when the training phase is attacked , the achievable rate is rapidly saturated even when @xmath54 .",
    "this is the effect of _ jamming - pilot contamination_.",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : ratenjam ] , the jamming attack during the training phase highly affects the system performance .",
    "therefore , we focus on the training phase and construct counter strategies to mitigate the effect of jamming - pilot contamination .",
    "we propose pilot retransmission schemes where the pilot will be retransmitted when the jamming - pilot contamination is high ( @xmath29 is large ) .",
    "note that , some overheads for synchronization are necessary for the pilot retransmission protocols .",
    "however , those overheads are negligible compared to the payload data .",
    "we show that by exploiting asymptotic properties of the massive mimo system , the bs can estimate @xmath29 and @xmath56 from the received pilot signals @xmath26 and @xmath32 even @xmath31 is unknown .      by the law of large numbers , [ eq : as1 ] _",
    "t^2 & & = p_t + q_t|_^t_^*|^2 + + & & + + & & + _ ^t _ ^ * + & & + + & & ^a.s . p_t_+q_t|_^t _ ^*|^2 _ + 1 ,   m , where @xmath58 denotes almost sure convergence . from , and under the assumption that the bs knows @xmath10 and @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath57 can be estimated as [ eq : as2 ] = _ t^2 - - .      from and again from the law of large numbers , as @xmath54 , we have _ t^h_t ^a.s .",
    "p_t__^*_^t + q_t__^*_^t + _ .",
    "thus , the bs can estimate @xmath56 as [ eq : es11 ] = _ t^h_t - _ ^*_^t - _ . based on the estimates of @xmath57 and @xmath56 , in next sections , we propose two pilot retransmission schemes to deal with two common jamming cases : random and deterministic jamming .",
    "in practice , if the jammer does not have the prior knowledge of the pilot sequences used by the user , then it will send a random sequence to attack the system . during the training phase",
    ", the user sends a pilot sequence @xmath59 , while the jammer sends a random jamming sequence .",
    "the bs estimates @xmath57 and requests the user to retransmit a new pilot sequence until @xmath57 is smaller than a threshold @xmath60 or the number of transmissions exceeds the maximum number @xmath61 .",
    "the pilot retransmission algorithm is summarized as follows :    [ sec : algo1 ]     * initialization : set @xmath62 , choose the values of pilot length @xmath13 , threshold @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "* user sends a random @xmath64 pilot sequence @xmath59 .",
    "* the bs estimates @xmath57 using . if @xmath65 or @xmath66 @xmath67 stop",
    "otherwise , go to step 4 . *",
    "set @xmath68 , go to step 2 .",
    "let @xmath69 and @xmath70 be the pilot and jamming sequences respectively , corresponding to the @xmath71th retransmission , @xmath72 . similar to",
    ", the achievable rate of the massive mimo with anti - jamming for random jamming is given by [ r_rj ] r_=(1-)_2 ( 1 + ) , where @xmath73 .",
    "note that in order to realize the achievable rate @xmath74 in ( [ r_rj ] ) , the bs has to buffer the received pilot signal then processes with the best one ( with minimal @xmath75 ) after @xmath76 pilot retransmissions .",
    "there exists case where @xmath77 is minimum which degrades the system performance since it consumes more training resource without finding a better candidate .",
    "however , the pilot is only retransmitted when the first transmission is bad , and hence , there will be a high probability that the retransmission is better than the first one .",
    "next , we assume that the jamming sequences are deterministic during the training phase , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "such scenario can happen , for instance , in case the jammer has the prior knowledge of the pilot length and pilot sequence codebook and tries to attack using a deterministic function of those training sequences @xcite .",
    "in this case , the massive mimo system can outsmart the jammer by adapting the training sequences based on the knowledge on the current pilot transmission instead of just randomly retransmitting them as in the previous case .",
    "we observe that @xmath57 can be decomposed as |_^t_^*|^2=_^t _",
    "^*_^t_^*. so , if the bs knows @xmath56 , it can choose @xmath52 to minimize @xmath29 . in section  [ sec : estjj ] , we know",
    "that the bs can estimate @xmath56 from @xmath32 . from this observation",
    ", we propose the following pilot retransmission scheme :    [ sec : algo2 ]     * initialization : choose the values of pilot length @xmath13 and threshold @xmath60 .",
    "* user sends a @xmath64 pilot sequence @xmath59 .",
    "* the bs estimates @xmath57 using .",
    "if @xmath79 @xmath67 stop .",
    "otherwise , go to step 4 .",
    "* the bs estimates @xmath56 using .",
    "then , the bs finds @xmath80 so that @xmath81 is minimal . if @xmath82 , then the user will retransmit this new pilot .    since the bs requests the user to retransmit its pilot",
    "only if @xmath29 of the first transmission exceeds the threshold @xmath60 , the achievable rate is [ r_dj ] r_=(1-)_2(1 + ) , where @xmath83 the maximal number of retransmissions for this case is one .",
    "in this section , we numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed anti - jamming schemes in term of the average achievable rate .",
    "the average is taken over 50000 realizations of @xmath84 .",
    "we assume that the transmit powers at the user and jammer satisfy @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we also assume @xmath87 channel uses , maximum number of transmissions @xmath88 .",
    "[ vstau ] illustrates the average achievable rates for different anti - jamming schemes according to the training payload ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "it shows that in order to achieve the best performances , the training payloads should be selected properly to balance the channel estimation quality ( @xmath13 is large enough ) and the resource allocated for data transmission ( @xmath13 is not too large ) . as expected , the proposed schemes with pilot retransmission outperform the conventional scheme ( without pilot retransmission ) .",
    "when the training sequence is very long , i.e. , @xmath89 is large , the proposed schemes are close to the conventional one since the probability of pilot retransmission is very small as the channel estimation quality is often good enough after the first training transmission .",
    "note that in this simulation , we choose @xmath90 which is not optimal in general .",
    "it is expected that the benefits of the our proposed schemes are even larger with optimal @xmath60 .    , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "the solid curves , dotted curves ( with label `` rj '' ) , and dashed curves ( with label `` dj '' ) denote the achievable rates without pilot retransmission ( c.f . proposition 1 ) , with counter strategy for random jamming ( c.f .",
    "1 ) , and with counter strategy for deterministic jamming ( c.f . alg .",
    "2 ) , respectively.,width=283 ]    figure  [ vsm ] shows the average achievable rates versus the number of bs antennas . without anti - jamming strategy ,",
    "the pilot contamination can severely harm the system performance and obstruct the scaling of achievable rate with @xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis in section iii .",
    "the performance can be remarkably improved by using the pilot retransmission protocols .",
    "particularly , for the case of deterministic jamming , the proposed scheme can overcome the pilot contamination bottleneck and allows the achievable rates scale with @xmath0 even when @xmath0 is large .",
    "the problem of anti - jamming for a single - user uplink massive mimo has been considered .",
    "it showed that jamming attacks could severely degrade the system performance . by exploiting the asymptotic properties of large antenna array , we proposed two pilot retransmission protocols . with our proposed schemes ,",
    "the pilot sequences and training payload could flexibly be adjusted to reduce the effect of jamming attack and improve the system performance .",
    "future work may study multi - user networks .",
    "for instance , our results can be readily extended if a max - min fairness criterion is used .",
    "then the pilot retransmission protocol design is considering the worst user who has the smallest achievable rate .",
    "by treating @xmath49 as gaussian additive noise , an achievable rate of the channel in ( [ yc ] ) is given by [ eq : proofrate1a ] r&= & ( 1-)_2(1 + ) .",
    "let us define [ eq : proofrate1 ] , where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
