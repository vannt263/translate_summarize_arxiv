    "still , ultrafast spectroscopy studies are reported recently to show unusual properties.@xcite especially , the observation of nonlinear absorption when applying an ultrashort intense laser pulse to monolayer graphene reveals an extremely dense , quasithermal photoexcited - carrier state created by strong pumping on 10 fs time scale and metastable for several tens of femtoseconds , which implies a unique transient electronic state in the important emerging material graphene.@xcite    when strongly driven out of equilibrium by coherent light , the excited carriers subsequently participate in several dynamical processes during relaxing back to its equilibrium . among them",
    "are the carrier decoherence , thermalization , cooling , and electron - hole recombination .",
    "if the excitation pulse is short enough , by observing the responses followed from right after the pump , we can identify the typical time scales associated with theses processes .",
    "facilitated by recent ultrafast spectroscopy measurements , certain progress has been made .",
    "it is recognized that the ultrafast carrier dynamics in graphene is different from that in metals and semiconductors .",

    "rapid carrier - carrier scattering gives rise to an electronic thermalization time @xmath4 on the order of 10 fs.@xcite time - resolved studies observe different cooling time scales with the shortest @xmath5 from electron - optical phonon coupling and longer electron - hole recombination time @xmath6 on the ps time scale.@xcite thus , when applying an ultrashort pump pulse of @xmath7 , the distinct time scales @xmath8 entails an intermediate electronic state purely determined by carrier - carrier scattering .",
    "unlike in most semiconductors where @xmath9 , the extremely short decoherence time and the rapid carrier - carrier scattering quickly deplete the phase space from the neighbourhood of optical excitation to the whole band to fully thermalize the carriers as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic - illustration ] ( b ) .",
    "the analysis of coulomb interaction between the dirac - fermionic excitations shows a slow population imbalance relaxation,@xcite in particular at high pulse intensity due to the suppression of auger processes for strong pulse excitation,@xcite although there is no gap .",
    "thus for @xmath10 the number of photoexcited carriers in each branch of the dirac cone decays rather slowly .",
    "therefore , the fast decoherence and thermalization together with slow imbalance relaxation support a unique population - inverted electronic state adiabatically formed after the strong pump excitation , a quasi - stable `` hourglass '' state on the time scale of some tens of femtoseconds , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic - illustration ] ( c ) .        in this article , we focus on this unique transient electronic state and provide details on ultrafast optical pump - probe spectroscopy measurement on monolayer graphene to reveal significant ultrafast optical nonlinearities , including nonlinear absorption saturation and near - infrared stimulated emission .",

    "optical gain emerges and directly manifests itself via a negative conductivity at the near - infrared region for the first 100s of fs , where stimulated emission completely compensates absorption loss in the graphene layer . to quantitatively investigate this transient , extremely dense photoexcited dirac - fermion state , we construct a simple model of a quasi - thermalized distribution with one electron temperature but two distinct chemical potentials associated with the electron- and hole - band , respectively .",
    "we find this transient state associated with high electron temperature @xmath11 up to 3000 - 4000k , which causes a broadband distribution extending to high energy that naturally explains the observed blueshifted component in photoluminescence spectrum.@xcite we further explore the phase space capacity and identify the maximal photoexcitation density restricted by phase space filling . and",
    "individual chemical potential of each band are calculated . to understand the observed nonlinear optical behavior and the measured large saturation density , we calculate the optical conductivity for this nonequilibrium electronic state .",
    "the results show that the available phase space can not be completely filled but will be saturated at a lower photoexcitation density due to the balance between absorption and emission .",
    "this calculated saturation density is in excellent agreement with the experimental value.@xcite most interestingly , our model reproduces the experimental results that the nearly - saturated states created by a high - frequency pump are unstable to a low - frequency pulse through stimulated emission to bring the system to a lower - level metastable state ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stimulated emission ] ) , resulting in an optical gain phenomenon within the first 100s of fs after photoexcitation .",
    "the excellent agreement between theory and experiment further corroborates that our simple model captures the feature of the transient state at early timescale ( @xmath12 ) in the high excitation regime .",
    "meanwhile , the comparison with the measured optical conductivity disfavors the equal - chemical - potential model to describe the transient states in graphene at the fs time scale , an outstanding issue debated in the community .    ]",
