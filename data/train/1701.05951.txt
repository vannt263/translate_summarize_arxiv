    "stern and gerlach showed in their famous experiment in 1922 that a beam of silver atoms is transversely split into spin - up and spin - down components by an inhomogenous magnetic field @xcite . after this discovery , the question was raised whether a corresponding experiment could also be conducted with an electron beam . for charged particles ,",
    "however , the spin - separating mechanism is hindered by the influence of the lorentz force ( in combination with the uncertainty principle ) , as was pointed out by bohr and pauli .",
    "more precisely , they argued that it is impossible to separate an electron beam into spin components by means of experiments based on the concept of classical particle trajectories @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was later turned into a paradigm about the impossibility of a stern - gerlach spin polarizer for free electrons and has entered into the textbook literature .",
    "first attempts to overcome this paradigm have been undertaken in the late 1990s .",
    "the principle feasibility of separating spins in an electron beam by the inhomogenous magnetic field of two antiparallel electric currents was analyzed in terms of classical trajectories @xcite .",
    "partial splitting of spin components by a unidirectional inhomogenous @xmath0 field was shown by means of combined classical and quantum calculations @xcite .",
    "complete spin separation through a `` longitudinal '' stern - gerlach effect , where the electron beam moves along the magnetic field axis and is split in this direction , was obtained from a full quantum treatment @xcite .",
    "significant progress towards a stern - gerlach - like spin polarizer for electrons has been achieved in very recent years .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that spin - polarization of electron beams may be created by magnetic gratings which are either formed by microscopic current loops @xcite or solid - state nanostructures @xcite . while in the first case , the diffraction pattern consists of characteristic spin doublet lines , in the latter case , the spin polarization occurs a talbot length away from the exit surface of the grating . besides , a mach - zehnder interferometer , which combines standing laser waves with static magnetic fields from solenoids , has been proposed to exert magnetic phase control on electron beams @xcite . by exploiting fine - tuned spin - dependent phase shifts , a transverse spin separation into two components  similar to the original stern - gerlach experiment  is predicted .",
    "moreover , a spin - polarizing wien filter for electron vortex beams was described which relies on multipolar electric and magnetic fields with cylindrical symmetry and a conversion of orbital to spin angular momentum @xcite .",
    "very recently , two proposals have been put forward how spin polarization of free electron beams may be attained by exploiting the kapitza - dirac ( kd ) effect @xcite .",
    "previous studies of spin - dependent kd scattering have always found `` symmetric '' spin effects : the probabilities to scatter an incident spin - up electron into a spin - down state and vice versa coincide @xcite .",
    "consequently , when an unpolarized electron beam is incident , the scattered part of the beam will remain unpolarized because the spin of each single electron has flipped . this symmetry is broken in @xcite by considering an electron moving along the axis of a monochromatic standing laser wave of circular polarization .",
    "the two different spin orientations along the beam axis are found to precess with slightly different rabi frequencies , allowing to divide the electron beam longitudinally into two spin - polarized portions by tailoring the interaction time . a transverse separation of the spin components can be achieved by an interferometric arrangement of three pairs of linearly polarized laser beams @xcite . in the first stage of this setup ,",
    "the electron beam is divided into two portions by scattering from a bichromatic laser field in a three - photon kd process .",
    "afterwards , the partial beams are superposed coherently , leading to two outgoing electron beams with a high degree of spin polarization",
    ".    the original kd effect refers to ( spin - independent ) electron scattering on a standing wave of light which can be formed by two counterpropagating waves of the same frequency @xcite . by absorbing one photon from one of the laser beams and emitting another photon of opposite momentum into the counterpropagating beam ( stimulated compton scattering ) ,",
    "the electron is elastically scattered . a theoretical generalization to strong laser fields",
    "has been developed @xcite . the effect was experimentally observed both in the bragg and the diffraction regimes @xcite .",
    "related experiments studied kd scattering on atomic beams @xcite . for reviews on the subject , we refer to @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent studies on spin - insensitive kd scattering may be found in @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we continue our investigations @xcite of spin - dependent kd effects in bichromatic laser fields .",

    "the outgoing portion of the electron beam with negative momentum has the opposite degree of polarization.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    our findings , that the polarization degree @xmath127 strongly depends on @xmath122 and that the maximally achievable value of @xmath127 remains below 100% , may be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "the field - induced detuning arising in the bichromatic kd effect has a twofold negative impact on the performance of the beam splitter .",
    "first , the reduced rabi oscillation amplitude leads to an uneven splitting of the beam in the first stage .",
    "this results in imperfect polarization because the destructive interference in the final stage for either spin states can not be complete .",
    "second , because of the intrinsic detuning , the ( mean ) energies of the incident momentum mode and the scattered momentum mode slightly differ during the interaction . as a consequence , a relative offset developes between the quantum phases accumulated by both modes .",
    "this is harmful for the spin polarization achieved after their coherent superposition in the final stage of the interferometer .",
    "we argue that , by a proper choice of @xmath122 , this second detrimental effect can be compensated because @xmath122 enters into the same quantum phases .",
    "this is why the resulting degree of polarization is modulated by the phase parameter , as depicted in fig .  [ degree ] .",
    "we have shown that electron spin dynamics in bichromatic kd scattering are very sensitive to the polarization states of the laser beams , whose frequency ratio was chosen as 2 . this way , previous investigations of the subject @xcite have been extended .    when the fundamental laser beam is circular - polarized , no spin effects were found to leading order .",
    "the latter corresponds to a three - photon process , where two photons of the fundamental frequency are absorbed and a second - harmonic photon is emitted ( or vice versa ) .",
    "however , at higher field intensities , where a perturbative description does not apply , spin - flip transitions can occur .",
    "they exhibit characteristic rabi oscillations as a function of the interaction time .",
    "this effect was explicitly demonstrated for the configuration where both laser waves are circular - polarized .",
    "spin dynamics can be controlled very effectively when a second - harmonic beam of circular polarization is combined with a fundamental laser beam of linear polarization .",
    "this setup , which works at low field intensities , can be used as a longitudinal spin filter for electrons moving along the beam axis ( similarly to the scheme proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "transverse momentum components of the electrons would exert a detrimental impact , though , allowing for spin - independent scattering events .",
    "the setup can be optimized by utilizing a fundamental laser beam with a small degree of ellipticity .",
    "if the latter is properly chosen with @xmath128% , the spin filter is effective for electrons with nonzero transverse momentum , as well . from an incident electron beam satisfying the bragg condition ,",
    "only , say , spin - up electrons are scattered ( and thereby flipped to the spin - down state with respect to the laser beam axis ) whereas spin - down electrons go through undeflected . the laser field configuration thus acts as a spin polarizer , splitting the electron beam according to its spin composition and creating two outgoing partial beams with parallel spin orientation . for comparison",
    ", we note that the interferometric spin polarizer proposed in @xcite produces outgoing partial beams with opposite spin orientations along the magnetic field direction , in close analogy with the stern - gerlach effect @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "bichromatic kd scattering enables spin polarization of free electron beams . by properly chosing the polarization geometry of the laser waves",
    ", the spin dynamics can be controlled in order to optimize the desired spin properties of the output beams .",
