    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are powerful flashes of high  energy photons occurring at an average rate of a few per day throughout the universe",
    ". even though they are highly transient events very hard to localize , they are so bright that they can be detected up to very high redshift ( the current record is @xmath3 ) .",
    "the energy source of a grb is believed to be associated to the collapse of the core of a massive star in the case of long  duration grbs , and due to merger or accretion  induced collapse for the short  hard class of grbs ( see mszros 2006 for a recent review ) . in this paper , we limit our analysis to the class of long  duration grbs .",
    "one of the main goals of the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) is to trackle the key issue of the grb luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "unfortunately , although the number of grbs with good redshift determination has been largely increased by _",
    "swift _ , the sample is still too poor ( and bias dominated ) to allow a direct measurement of the lf .",
    "many studies ( e.g. lamb & reichart 2000 ; porciani & madau 2001 ( pm01 ) ; schmidt 2001 , choudhury & srianand 2002 ; firmani et al . 2004 ; guetta , piran & waxman 2005 ; natarajan et al.2005 ; daigne , rossi & mochkovitch 2006 ) tried to constrain the grb lf under the assumption that grbs trace the observed star formation rate , as suggested by the association of long grbs to the death of massive stars .",
    "following these works and assuming the most recent star formation rate determination , we derive the lf and formation rate of grbs by fitting the observed _ batse _ differential peak flux distribution in three different scenarios : i ) grbs follow the cosmic star formation and have a constant lf ; ii ) the grb lf varies with redshift ; iii ) grbs form in low  metallicity environments .",
    "we check the results against the 2year _ swift _ data , focusing in particular on the large sample of high redshift ( @xmath0 ) grbs detected by this instrument .",
    "the observed photon flux , @xmath4 , in the energy band @xmath5 , emitted by an isotropically radiating source at redshift @xmath1 is    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the differential rest ",
    "frame photon luminosity of the source , and @xmath8 is the luminosity distance . to describe the typical burst spectrum we adopt the functional form proposed by band et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , i.e. a broken power ",
    "law with a low  energy spectral index @xmath9 , a high  energy spectral index @xmath10 , and a break energy @xmath11 . in this work ,",
    "we take @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( preece et al .",
    "2000 ) , and @xmath14 kev ( pm01 ) .",
    "moreover , it is customary to define an isotropic equivalent intrinsic burst luminosity in the energy band 30 - 2000 kev as @xmath15 . given a normalized grb lf , @xmath16 , and the detector efficiency , @xmath17 , the observed rate of bursts with peak flux between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is    @xmath20    where @xmath21 $ ] is the comoving volume element , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . ] , and @xmath24^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "@xmath25 is the solid angle covered on the sky by the survey , and the factor @xmath26 accounts for cosmological time dilation .",
    "finally , @xmath27 is the comoving burst formation rate . in this work",
    ", we assume that the grb lf is described by    @xmath28",
    "we consider three different scenarios . in the first one ,",
    "the grb formation rate is proportional to the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 , and the lf does not evolve with redshift , i.e. @xmath31 . the factor @xmath32 gives the number of grbs formed per solar mass in stars and has units of @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath29 ( in units of @xmath34 mpc@xmath35 yr@xmath36 ) is commonly parameterized with the form proposed by cole et al .",
    "( 2001 ) as    @xmath37    recently , hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) have provided the values of the coefficients @xmath38 by fitting the available uv and far  infrared measurements for @xmath39 , corrected for dust obscuration . in this paper",
    ", we adopt their best fit parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( hopkins & beacom 2006 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath43 is taken to be slightly lower than the original one in order to match the decline of the sfr with @xmath44 at @xmath45 suggested by recent deep  field data ( see stark et al . 2006 and references therein ) .    in the second scenario , while the grb formation rate is still proportional to the observed sfr , the cut ",
    "off luminosity in the grb lf increases with redshift as @xmath46 .",
    "lloyd  ronning , fryer & ramirez  ruiz ( 2002 ) , using grb redshifts and luminosities derived from the luminosity  variability relationship , found that the data imply @xmath47 , and we adopt this as fiducial value .    finally , we consider a case in which grbs form only in environments with metallicity below a given threshold ( no evolution in the lf",
    "is considered ) .",
    "in fact , some theoretical models ( see mszros 2006 and reference therein ) require that grb progenitors should have metallicity @xmath48",
    ". observations of grb host galaxies ( see savaglio 2006 and reference therein ) seems in agreement with this prescription , showing that grb preferentially originates in low  metallicity regions .",
    "langer & norman ( 2006 ) have quantified the amount of star formation at a given metallicity , using a recent determination of the stellar mass function ( panter et al .",
    "2004 ) and the observed mass  metallicity correlation ( savaglio et al . 2005 ) . adopting the metallicity redshift evolution derived from emission line studies ( kewley & kobulnicky 2005 )",
    ", the fractional mass density belonging to metallicity below a given threshold , @xmath49 , can be computed as    @xmath50    where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are the incomplete ( complete ) gamma function , and @xmath53 . the grb formation rate is then given by @xmath54 .",
    "the main effect of this convolution is that the grb formation rate peaks at higher redshift with respect to the cosmic sfr .",
    "we adopt @xmath55 as fiducial value , and , in this case , the grb formation peaks at @xmath56 .",
    "the free parameters in our model are the grb formation efficiency @xmath57 , the cut  off luminosity at @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and the power index , @xmath60 , of the grb lf function .",
    "following pm01 , we optimized the value of these parameters by @xmath61 minimization over the observed differential number counts in the 50300 kev band of _",
    "batse_. we use the off  line _ batse _ sample of kommers et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which includes 1998 archival ( `` triggered '' plus `` non  triggered '' ) bursts , and for which the detector efficiency is well described by the function @xmath62 $ ] ( kommers et al .",
    "we report the best  fit parameters for our fiducial models in table  [ tab : fit ] . in the last column , we give the reduced @xmath61 for the best ",
    "fitting model , showing that it is always possible to find a good agreement with the data and @xmath60 is observed in the parameter space surrounding the best  fit parameters ( see also pm01 ) ] .",
    "note that for the metallicity evolution scenario a higher grb formation efficiency is required , since grbs form only in a ( small ) fraction of star forming galaxies .",
    "we can now use the best  fit parameters to compute the expected differential peak flux distribution of grbs in the 15150 kev band of the burst alert telescope ( bat ) instrument onboard of _ swift_. the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : swift ] and compared with the observed _ swift_/bat data points .",
    "all models show a good agreement with the data without the need of any change of the grb lf and formation efficiency , indicating that _ batse _ and _ swift _ are observing essentially the same population of grbs .",
    "this conclusion is rather insensitive to @xmath63% variations of the adopted grb spectrum parameters , i.e. for the large majority of burst spectra ( kaneko et al .",
    "our model allows us to compute the expected redshift distribution of grbs detected by _",
    "swift_. we decide to avoid the comparison between model results and the overall observed distribution of bursts with known redshift , since this procedure implicitly assumes that the observed sample of grbs with redshift determination is representative of all detected sources .",
    "moreover , important information are missed by this kind of analysis : for example , that many bright grbs are identified at high redshift .",
    "so , we try to answer this simple question : _ is the redshift distribution consistent with the number of _ swift _ detections at @xmath0 and @xmath64 ?",
    "_    the cumulative number of grbs , identified during the two years of the _ swift _ mission at @xmath0 ( left panel ) and @xmath64 ( right panel ) , is plotted in figure  [ fig : zgt ] toghether with model predictions .",
    "note that _ swift _ detections are to be considered as a strong lower limit , since many high@xmath1 bursts can be missed by optical follow  up searches .",
    "the model with no lf evolution clearly underestimates the number of high redshift grb detections at any photon flux and no bright grbs are predicted for @xmath64 .",
    "we checked that variations of the shape of the sfr do not affect this result : even assuming a constant sfr at @xmath65 , the model predictions do not change significantly .",
    "in fact , for relatively bright grbs , the rapid decline in the lf strongly hampers the detection of high redshift bursts .",
    "furthermore , our analysis does not depend on the faint ",
    "end of the lf : increasing the population of faint grbs would decrease the number of high@xmath1 detections , strengthening our conclusion .",
    "so , models in which grbs trace the cosmic sfr and are described by a constant lf , are ruled out by the large sample of high@xmath1 _ swift _ grbs .",
    "the number of high@xmath1 _ swift _ identifications can be justified assuming that the lf varies with redshift . in this case , high@xmath1 grbs are typically brighter than low@xmath1 ones , so that are much easely detected . assuming that the luminosity increases as @xmath66 , we find many sources at @xmath0 , but the model is barely consistent with the number of bright grbs at @xmath64 . since some high@xmath1 sources can be missed by optical follow  up searches , an even stronger evolution might be required to explain the data .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that grb formation is restricted to low  metallicity environments . in this case",
    ", the peak of the grb formation is shifted towards higher redshift , so that the probability of high@xmath1 detections increases .",
    "assuming @xmath55 , _ swift _ identification are exceeded both at @xmath0 and @xmath64 without requiring any evolution in the lf .",
    "thus , the model is consistent with a fraction of high redshift bursts missed by optical follow  up searches .",
    "increasing the threshold metallicity will decrease the number of sources at high@xmath1 : for @xmath67 the model becomes inconsistent with the number of observed grbs at @xmath64 .",
    "higher threshold values would require evolution of the grb luminosity and/or a more gentle decline of the sfr at high redshift .    in conclusion ,",
    "the existence of a large sample of bursts at @xmath0 in the _ swift _ 2-year data imply that grbs have experienced some kind of evolution , being more luminous or more common in the past .",
    "the discovery of grb050904 at @xmath3 ( antonelli et al . 2005 ; tagliaferri et al . 2005 ; kawai et al .",
    "2006 ) during the first year of the _ swift _ mission has strengthened the idea that many grbs should be observed out to very high redshift ( e.g. natarajan et al . 2005 ; bromm & loeb 2006 ; daigne et al . 2006 ) . unfortunately , no other source at @xmath68 has been detected in the second year of observations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : zgt6 ] , we plot the _ swift _ detection rate expected for the three scenarios here considered . models without evolution predict almost no sources to be detected at very high redshift .",
    "if luminosity evolution ( @xmath69 ) is allowed , @xmath70 bursts / yr should lie above @xmath71 for @xmath72 ph @xmath73 s@xmath36 , whereas , in the metallicity evolution scenario ( @xmath55 ) , we expect @xmath74 grbs / yr , one or two being at @xmath75 .    the detection rate are found to decrease rapidly with increasing peak fluxes .",
    "indeed , it is interesting to note that grb050904 was relatively bright , being its observed photon flux @xmath76 ph @xmath73 s@xmath36",
    ". at this limit , only @xmath77 ( 2 ) bursts / yr would be at @xmath68 , if luminosity ( metallicity ) evolution is assumed .",
    "thus , the lack of very high redshift identification in the 2nd year of the _ swift _ mission might be due to practical difficulties in the optical follow  up of faint grbs .",
    "in fact , no grb with observed photon fluxes below @xmath78 ph @xmath73 s@xmath36 has uvot detection and only in a couple of cases a reliable redshift determination was possible .",
    "so , the identification of just one burst at @xmath79 in two years of _ swift _ mission is not very surprising . on the contrary",
    ", the discovery of grb050904 may suggest that the _ swift _ follow  up procedure is working very well , at least for relatively bright bursts .",
    "we have computed the luminosity function and the formation rate of long grbs by fitting the _ batse _ differential peak flux number counts in three different scenarios : i ) grbs follow the cosmic star formation and have a redshift  independent lf ; ii ) the grb lf varies with redshift ; iii ) grbs are associated with star formation in low  metallicity environments . in all cases ,",
    "it is possible to obtain a good fit to the data by adjusting the model free parameters .",
    "moreover , using the same lf and formation rate , it is possible to reproduce both _",
    "batse _ and _ swift _ differential counts , showing that the two satellites are observing the same grb population .",
    "we have then computed the expected burst redshift distribution , testing the results against the number of high redshift grbs , detected during the two years of the _ swift _ mission .",
    "we find that models where grbs trace the sfr and are described by a constant lf largely underestimate the number high@xmath1 grbs detected by _",
    "swift_. this conclusion does not depend on the redshift distribution of burst lacking of optical identification , nor on the existence of a decline in the sfr at @xmath2 , nor on the adopted faint ",
    "end of the lf .",
    "alternatively , we find that the observed number of high@xmath1 detection can be justified by assuming that the grb luminosity increases with redshift and/or that grbs preferentially form in low  metallicity environments .    finally , we have estimated the detection rate of bursts at very high redshift .",
    "we find that @xmath70 ( 8) grbs / yr should be observed at @xmath68 , if luminosity ( metallicity ) evolution is assumed .",
    "the majority of these sources is faint and may be missed in optical follow  up searches , but @xmath77 ( 3 ) grb / yr should be relatively bright , with an observed photon flux in excees to 0.5 ph @xmath73 s@xmath36 .",
