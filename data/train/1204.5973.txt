    "phase transitions in the early universe have several cosmological consequences and provide an important link between particle physics and cosmology . in particular , different types of topological defects may have been created by the vacuum phase transitions after planck time.@xcite among them the cosmic strings are of special interest . the gravitational field produced by a cosmic string",
    "may be approximated by a planar angle deficit in the two - dimensional sub - space . in quantum field theory",
    "the corresponding non - trivial topology of this sub - space induces non - zero vacuum expectation values for physical observables . in this context , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the energy - momentum tensor have been calculated for scalar@xcite@xcite and fermionic@xcite@xcite fields .",
    "de sitter ( ds ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) spaces are curved spacetimes which have been most studied in quantum field theory during the past two decades .",
    "the main reason resides in the fact that they are curved maximally symmetric spacetimes and several physical problem can be exactly solvable on these backgrounds . specifically the importance of ds spacetime has increased by the appearance of the inflationary cosmology scenario.@xcite in great number of inflationary models , approximated ds spacetime is employed to solve relevant problems in standard cosmology . as to the ads space , one of its more important applications arises in braneworld scenario .",
    "the large extra dimension provides a solution to the hierarchy problem between the gravitational and electroweak mass scales .",
    "the vacuum polarizations effects on the background of ds and ads spacetimes , have been discussed , respectively , in@xcite@xcite and in@xcite@xcite for fields of different spins .    in this paper ,",
    "mainly supported by two previous publications,@xcite we shall analyze the vacuum polarization effects associated with a massive scalar quantum field in the ds and ads spacetimes in the presence of a cosmic string .",
    "the presence of the string is the new ingredient in the analysis .",
    "because the pure ds or ads spacetimes are maximally symmetric spaces , the vacuum polarizations effects associated with scalar quantum fields do not depend on the spacetime point . on the other hand , considering the presence of a cosmic string , the corresponding quantities present explicitly dependences on the proper distance to the string .",
    "this is basically the content of this paper . to investigate the influence of a cosmic string on the vevs of the field squared . in order to do that one important quantity to be used",

    "we may write this function as : @xmath77 where the first term corresponds to the wightman function in a pure ds or ads spacetime , and the second one is the contribution induced by the presence of the cosmic string in the corresponding spacetime .",
    "consequently by and we may write , @xmath78 unfortunately the above expression is divergent and some renormalization procedure is needed ; however only the contribution in pure ds or ads spacetime is divergent , so the renormalization procedure is needed only for the first contribution . as to the second contribution it is finite for points outside the string , i.e. , for @xmath79 . because the vev of the field squared in ds and ads spacetimes have been analyzed by many authors , here we are mainly interested in the analysis of the quantum effects induced by the presence of cosmic string .    due to the maximal symmetry of the ds and ads spacetimes ,",
    "the vev of the field squared , @xmath80 , does not depend on a specific point of the corresponding spacetime ; consequently , as we shall see , the contribution induced by the cosmic string , @xmath81 , will become more relevant for points near the string .    according to the previous section , we shall analyze the vev of the field squared induced by the cosmic string for @xmath6 being an integer number .      for the ds spacetime ,",

    "it can be shown @xmath98 taking the limit @xmath99 , we found @xmath100 , so @xmath101 the above result is an analytical function of @xmath6 , and by the analytical continuation it is valid for arbitrary values of @xmath6 .      for the ads spacetime ,",
    "the contribution for vev of the field squared due to the presence of cosmic string is given as shown below : @xmath102 with @xmath103    in figure [ fig2 ] we have displayed the dependence of the string - induced part in the vev of the field squared versus the proper distance , @xmath104 , from the string ( measured in units of the ads curvature radius ) .",

    "in this paper we have analyzed the influence of a cosmic string in ds and ads spacetimes in the evaluation of the vacuum expectation values of the quantum filed squared .",
    "the corresponding results were given by and .",
    "these objectives were satisfactorily obtained because , for both spacetimes , the corresponding wightman functions could be expressed as the sum of two terms : the first ones due to the ds or ads backgrounds in the absence of string , and the second ones induced by the presence of the string .",
    "these facts allowed us to write the vevs as the sum of two contributions following the same structure of the wightman functions .",
    "moreover , because the presence of the string does not modify the curvatures of the ds and ads backgrounds , all the divergences presented in the calculations of vevs of the field squared , appear only in the contributions due the purely ds or ads space .",
    "so , the contributions induced by the string do not require renormalization .",
    "all of them are automatically finite for points outside the string . to obtain a better understanding of the quantitative behavior of both vevs , it was provided two graphs , figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , exhibiting their dependence on the proper distance to the string .",
    "these contributions becomes higher and higher in the regions near the string . because the vevs of field squared associated with pure ds and ads spacetimes are point - independent , near the string the contributions induced by the cosmic string become more relevant than the the contributions due to pure ds or ads spacetimes themselves ; moreover , by the graphs we can also observe that the contributions induced by the string becomes higher for higher value of the parameter @xmath6",
