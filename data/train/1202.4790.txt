    "morphological and dynamical peculiarities of galaxies can be used as diagnostics of galaxy formation .",

    "a counter - rotating gas disc during galaxy formation is dynamically unstable .",
    "kinematically - distinct gas components are therefore more likely to be the result of subsequent accretion than of being primordial @xcite .",
    "counter - rotating gas is more common in elliptical and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies than gas - rich spirals ( see bureau & chung 2006 for an extensive discussion of the frequency in s0s ; sarzi et al . 2006 and davis et al . 2011 , for ellipticals ) .",
    "as @xcite argue , this probably reflects both that 1 ) it is harder for counter - rotating gas to survive in late - type galaxies due to friction within co - rotating material , and 2 ) the accretion event itself can help consume most of the gas in a triggered starburst , which may yield a gas - poor early - type system with some kinematically - distinct gas leftover . hence studying the origin(s ) of counter - rotating gas is important to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies , in particular that of the early - type population , and growth through gas accretion and minor mergers @xcite .    for the origin of counter - rotating gas ,",
    "sporadic or continuous gas infall from the galactic halo and merging with gas - rich systems have been suggested ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . alternatively , gas accretions from filaments , predicted to occur frequently in low - density regions today ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may well form kinematically - distinct components . as some simulations have shown ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , continuous gas infall might be best suited for the creation of extensive counter - rotating gas discs .",
    "observationally , on the other hand , a number of counter - rotators with hints of minor merging events have been found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we still lack bullet - proof evidence of gas accretion directly associated with these merging events .",
    "one such @xmath11 example is the galaxy pair ngc  1596 and ngc  1602 @xcite .",
    "ngc  1596 is one of the counter - rotators serendipitously found by @xcite in the sample of @xcite . as shown in figure 1 of @xcite , the galaxy hosts ionized gas that in the central few kpc is rotating in the opposite direction to the bulk of the stars .",
    "the counter - rotating gas is kinematically asymmetric , extending up to 150  km  s@xmath12 on one side of the disc while it extends less than 50  km  s@xmath12 on the other side .",
    "there is a companion with a similar systemic velocity , ngc  1602 , at distance of 20  kpc ( from centre to centre ) .",
    "a deep optical image by @xcite revealed extended stellar envelopes around both galaxies , with no clear border in - between ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "in an hi follow - up study using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , @xcite found a large hi structure covering both galaxies . the hi morphology and kinematics are quite regular with no sign of disturbance within the stellar disc of ngc  1602 , while they become highly asymmetric in the outer disc .",
    "an hi tail can clearly be seen on one side , leading from ngc  1602 to the centre of ngc  1596 .",
    "this strongly supports the hypothesis that much of the gas in ngc  1596 originates from its gas - rich companion and must have been heated while entering ngc  1596 , as it is observed in the form of ionized gas in ngc  1596 .",
    "besides ngc  1596 , @xcite identified two more counter - rotators , ngc  128 and ngc  3203 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as shown in fig",
    "1 of @xcite , the counter - rotating ionized gas in these galaxies is found to be a few kpc in size with a maximum rotation velocity comparable to the stars ( @xmath13 km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "the counter - rotating component is quite symmetric in the case of ngc  128 , being widely spread to both sides of the disc , while it is mostly found on one side of the disc in ngc  3203 .",
    "both systems have closeby galaxies at similar velocities or candidate companions that are potential donors of counter - rotating gas , like ngc  1602 . in this work we present results from our hi follow - up study of these galaxies , using the very large array ( vla ) to study their hi properties and environment .",
    "in addition , we have included another well - known counter - rotator of similar morphology , the barred s0 galaxy ngc  7332 from the study of @xcite .    in section 2 , we describe the general properties and the environment of our sample galaxies . in section 3 ,",
    "we summarize the hi observations and data reduction . in section 4",
    ", we describe the hi properties of the sample galaxies and their surroundings . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss the origin of the counter - rotating ionized gas and its role in galaxy evolution .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "we adopt a distance of 53.9  mpc and 38.2  mpc to ngc  128 and ngc  3203 , respectively , based on the standard cosmology with @xmath1473  km  s@xmath12  mpc@xmath12 , @xmath150.27 and @xmath160.73 @xcite . for ngc  7332",
    ", we adopt 23  mpc , a distance determined using the surface brightness fluctuation technique @xcite , which is probably the most reliable distance for this system .",
    "our sample consists of three edge - on disc galaxies , ngc  128 , ngc  3203 and ngc  7332 , where ionized gas ( [ oiii ] , but also h@xmath17 for ngc  7332 ) has been found to rotate in the opposite direction to the stars @xcite . besides hosting kinematically - decoupled ionized gas in their centre , the galaxies in the sample have other properties in common .",
    "firstly , each galaxy is surrounded by several definite or potential companions .",
    "figure  [ fig - sample ] shows optical images of the galaxy environments .",
    "dashed circles are drawn at 50  kpc projected radii around the counter - rotators at the adopted distance for each galaxy ( angular scales of 15.3 , 10.9 and 6.69  kpc per arcminute , respectively ) . within 50  kpc radii , the redshifts of relatively bright neighbours ( at most 15 times fainter than the counter - rotator , i.e. @xmath18 ) are always available , and their group membership is well defined .",
    "that is , ngc  127 and ngc  130 near ngc  128 , and ngc  7339 near ngc  7332 , are likely true neighbours , while eso  500-g023 in ngc  3203 s field must be a background object .",
    "the redshifts of dwarf galaxies fainter than that are not available and their association with the counter - rotators remains an open question . these optically - visible but small systems within the dashed circles ( whether catalogued or not ) are indicated with question marks in figure  [ fig - sample ] .",
    "at optical wavelengths , only one galaxy among the sample , ngc  128 , shows direct evidence for tidal interaction with its neighbour ngc  127 , as clearly indicated by the stellar tail between them .",
    "secondly , all galaxies in the sample have a boxy or peanut - shaped ( b / ps ) bulge , which is likely the edge - on view of a thickened bar ( see bureau & freeman 1999 and bureau & athanassoula 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , the presence of a bar has been kinematically confirmed in ngc  128 and ngc  3203 in the stellar kinematic study of @xcite , and in ngc  7332 by @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the counter - rotating gas and the presence of the bars will be discussed in more detail in section  [ discuss ] .",

    "+      the time required for a companion to spiral into the primary galaxy can be characterized by the dynamical friction timescale @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the initial radius of the orbit , @xmath29 is the orbital velocity , @xmath30 is the gravitational constant , @xmath31 is the mass of the companion , and ln@xmath32 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "as described in @xcite , the appropriate @xmath32 can be approximated by @xmath33 for this case . in more practical units ,",
    "this relation can be rewritten as @xmath34    we adopt the projected distance from the primary galaxy to its companion ( @xmath35 ) and their velocity difference ( @xmath36 ) as the orbital radius @xmath28 and velocity @xmath29 , respectively .",

    "are comparable and of the order of 10@xmath43  yr .",
    "this implies that these pairs are likely to soon merge and form a single system , fueling the primary galaxies with @xmath44 of hi gas .",
    "in fact , the hi discs of ngc  127 and ac  dwarf  i appear to cover some of their primary galaxy s discs already .",
    "this strongly supports the hypothesis that these two neighbours have been feeding ngc  128 and ngc  3203 with gas . for ugc  001760 ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are comparable but it is expected to take much longer than 10@xmath45  yr to merge with ngc  128 , while it will take even longer for ugc  298 to spiral into ngc  128 .",
    "the estimated coulomb logarithm of ngc  7339 is negative ( i.e. @xmath46 ) , suggesting that this galaxy is already in the process of merging with ngc  7332 .",
    "this is also supported by the observations of @xcite .",
    "we also have estimated @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the two farther dwarf neighbours , using @xmath47 and assuming that they are rotationally supported .",
    "for these two dwarfs , @xmath41 measured using the hi extent is about an order of magnitude larger than @xmath42 , and it may take many orbital periods for these two dwarf galaxies to merge . as they approach ngc  7332 and 7339",
    ", however , it is still possible that diffuse gas outside their stellar body at large radii could be stripped by the halo of their bigger neighbours , also fueling the pair ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* for satellites of the milky way ) .",
    "the fraction of all s0 galaxies with ionized gas counter - rotation is found to be some 15 per cent and slightly increases ( @xmath48 per cent ) for galaxies with detected ionized gas only ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this provides a lower limit to the gas accretion frequency among lenticular galaxies .",
    "this fraction however does not include 1 ) the elliptical galaxy population and 2 ) gas accreted in prograde orbit .",
    "taking these into account , the inferred frequency of gas accretion in early - type galaxies overall is expected to increase .",
    "this is supported by the high hi detection rate found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also oosterloo et al .",
    "2010 ) in their carefully selected e / s0 galaxies , many of which show direct evidence or hints of interaction .",
    "all these facts suggest that gas accretion from cold gas blobs is common among e / s0 galaxies and is thus an important source for their continous build - up .    in gas - rich late - type galaxies , where the gas acquired from outside ( either prograde or retrograde ) is likely to be swept away by existing gas on relatively short timescales , evidence of gas accretion ( especially from small gas blobs )",
    "may not be detected as frequently as in the e / s0 population @xcite .",
    "assuming the same statistics as for early - type galaxies , however , merging of small gas - rich dwarfs is also expected to be common among gas - rich late - type galaxies , and also may play an important role in replenishing their discs .",
    "it is worth noting that all three counter - rotators targeted here are gas - poor , barred s0 systems .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether gas accretion has played any role in exhausting the original gas in the host galaxy ( e.g. by triggering a burst of star formation ) or whether gas counter - rotation is preferentially observed in early - type systems simply because retrograde gas accretion can last longer than in gas - rich galaxies ( where it is likely to be swept away by co - rotating gas ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the former case",
    ", the recent star formation rate is expected to be quite high , assuming spirals with normal gas contents are the ancestors of the hosts . as discussed in detail in the previous sections ,",
    "the time the nearest neighbours will take to merge into the hosts is of order a few @xmath49  yrs .",
    "assuming a @xmath50 host with @xmath51 , our estimated dynamical friction timescales imply that these counter - rotators should have been forming stars at a rate of 550  @xmath52yr@xmath12 to use up their original gas .",
    "we however do not find any signature of such high star formation rates in the sample hosts , based on their low infrared fluxes and ionized gas emission @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is unlikely that only the gas in the host galaxies would be exhausted but not the gas in their companions , particularly in cases like ngc  127 and ac dwarf i , where we are witnessing the gas being captured by the primary galaxies .",
    "hence we conclude that gas accretion ( and the subsequent starburst ) is not likely to be responsible for the early - type morphology of our counter - rotators .",
    "it is however still possible that tidal interactions , along with gas accretion , played a role in forming the bar and bulge in these galaxies by 1 ) inducing instability in the disc , then 2 ) feeding the centre with the accreted gas , possibly triggering a nuclear starburst in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this hi follow - up study of three galaxies where ionized gas was found to be rotating in the opposite direction to the stars in the central few kpc , we systematically find evidence for cold gas accretion from neighbours , likely to be the origin of the counter - rotating ionized gas .",
    "the dynamical friction timescales of the neighbours are short and comparable to their orbital periods around the counter - rotators , suggesting that the pairs will merge and form a single system within about a gigayear , fueling the primary galaxy with @xmath44 of hi .",
    "we do not find strong evidence that gas accretion is directly responsible for the early - type morphology of the sample hosts , i.e. the transformation from gas - rich spirals to gas - poor lenticular systems .",
    "however , it could well have helped to form and fuel the bar in these galaxies .",
    "our data , along with statistics from the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggest that the accretion of cold gas blobs is an important source of gas in galaxies , and hence helps them continue to grow . although the accretion of gas blobs is expected to be more easily detected in gas - poor early - type systems , assuming the same frequency for late - type galaxies implies that cold accretion can also play a significant role in replenishing the disc of spirals .",
