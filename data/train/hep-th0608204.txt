    "besides some failed attempts to justify current acceleration of the universe by considering dimming mechanisms in the neighbourhood of distant supernovas ( see e.g. @xcite ) , essentially there are three main paradigms that have been invoked to lend physical support to the observed speeding - up of the universe : the cosmological constant @xcite , dark energy @xcite and modified gravity @xcite .",
    "it is well - known however that the existence of a cosmological term poses a fundamental problem with quantum field theory whose solution has been unsuccessfully looked for during the last quarter of century or so @xcite .",
    "then , whereas dark energy is usually implemented by introducing a scalar field that corresponds to a fluid with negative pressure @xcite , the idea of modifying gravity amounts to adding some extra terms to the hilbert - einstein lagrangian @xcite for general relativity , in both cases making recourse to older procedures already used in inflationary scenarios or quantum gravity .",
    "nevertheless , all of these paradigms are not free from remarkable shortcomings and , of course , look quite alien to the so - called occam razor guiding principle ; that is , no consistent new idea based just on einstein general relativity and the checked contents of the universe has so far been advanced to justify universal acceleration .",
    "i will consider here a cosmic model where we introduce what might be the germ of one of such ideas . in order to see how that model works",
    ", one could however make still use of a scalar field whose introduction would be motivated by up - grading - to field @xcite a background set of relativistic particles , showing then that the up - grading method becomes superfluous , so that the actual physical ingredients of the resulting cosmic model are just the sub - quantum characteristics that can be associated with the original radiation particles .",
    "our idea consists in identifying such radiation particles with the cosmic microwave background and what we currently call dark energy with the radiation sub - quantum potential energy .",
    "it will be finally shown that the resulting cosmic accelerating model describes a benigner phantom - like cosmology which is free from the main difficulties showed by that kind of cosmic models .",
    "our most economical description starts with the quasi - classical wave function for the considered particles @xmath0 in which @xmath1 is the probability amplitude to find the particle at position @xmath2 at time @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the corresponding classical action .",
    "now , from the real part of the expression resulting when applying the klein - gordon equation without any potential energy term to the above wave function we can derive the modified hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the classical energy and momentum , @xmath8 is the rest mass , and @xmath9 is the sub - quantum potential that distinguishes the classical from the quantum particle dynamics @xcite . note that in the classical limit @xmath10 eq . ( 2 ) becomes the classical hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "now , a cosmic field theory could be obtained by using the motivating up - grading method according to which @xmath11 and @xmath8 are respectively promoted to the scalar field quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , it will be shown later on that in the cosmological model we are going to build up we necessarily have @xmath14 and @xmath15 which are conditions that amount to convert the up - grading - to - field method into an identity operation and the original particles into radiation particles which thus becomes the sole physical entities , other than a cosmological constant , entering the model .",
    "this result can be implemented by using the following lagrangian density @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the elliptic integral of the second kind resulting from integrating the expression for the momentum derived from eq .",
    "( 2 ) over the particle velocity [ 10 ] , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the sub - quantum potential energy density .",
    "deriving the subsequent expressions for the energy density , @xmath21 , and pressure , @xmath7 , in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker scenario and assuming an equation of state @xmath22 , with the parameter @xmath23 , after some rather trivial manipulations , we finally obtain the required condition @xmath24 @xcite , and @xmath25 @xmath26 in which @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the scale factor of the flat universe .",
    "now , from the friedmann equation @xmath29 derived from our lagragian density , it follows that @xmath30 in addition , the equation of motion for coordinate @xmath31 has the general form @xmath32 it can be shown that the function @xmath33 is always divergent provided @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in order to ensure regularity of the whole model we should require that @xmath35 which is just the remaining necessary condition for making the present model self - consistent ; i.e. @xmath36 . in this way , we have for the hubble function @xmath37 with @xmath38 an integration constant playing the role of a cosmological constant .",
    "we have then the solutions @xmath39 in which @xmath40 is the initial value of the scale factor . in fig .",
    "1 we give the evolution of the scale factor corresponding to these solutions , as compared with that for a pure de sitter universe .",
    "solution @xmath41 describes a universe which initially accelerates with @xmath42 , then decelerates for a while to finally contract all the way down to zero .",
    "such a solution can be seen to violate the second law of thermodynamics and therefore will not be here considered as a realistic solution .",
    "moreover , present estimates of the parameter @xmath43 seem to place its value slightly beyond the de sitter barrier , a case which can never be described by solution @xmath41 .",
    "solution @xmath44 has not these shortcomings .",
    "it corresponds to what has been denoted as a phantom universe @xcite characterized by a parameter @xmath45 and will be taken in this report as the physical solution representing the current evolution of the universe",
    ".     corresponds to an equation of state with @xmath42 and violates the second law of thermodynamics ; solution @xmath44 corresponds to a phantom model with equation of state @xmath45 .",
    "problems in such a model are benigner than in known phantom models as it is stable , does not show any singularities at finite time in the future , corresponds to a positive kinetic term and violates dominant energy condition only quantum - mechanically . ]",
    "the point now is that the lagragian density and both the energy density and pressure become all zero , while the universe reduces to a de sitter universe , in the classical limit where the sub - quantum potential vanishes .",
    "thus , the main assumption of the present model is to interpret that it is the sub - quantum effect originated by the radiation particles that constitutes the cosmic microwave background that is the unique cause making the universe to accelerate .",
    "if so , we had accomplished a most economical model justifying the current acceleration of the universe without introducing any ac hoc mysterious dark energy field or modifying the hilbert - einstein gravity .",
    "solution @xmath44 actually describes what we can call a benign phantom universe .",
    "in fact , even though it corresponds to a tracking equation of state with @xmath45 , but very close to -1 for most of its evolution and the energy density is an increasing function of the cosmological time @xcite , it can be associated with a stable field theory having a kinetic term @xmath46 , shows no future singularity of the big rip kind and violates the dominant energy condition only quantum - mechanically , i.e. we always have @xmath47 which is a permissible violation of such a condition .",
    "we finally note that our model makes it compatible the current dominance of a sub - quantum energy phase with the previous matter domination in the universe .",
    "the ultimate reason for this consists in the realization that in a sub - quantum description all matter fields entering the lagrangian considered by amendola , quartin , tsujiwara and waga @xcite behave like though they were pure radiation just at the coincidence time .",
    "the main conclusion from this report is that the current acceleration of the universe should be described by a benigner phantom model which does not contain any extra fluid or modification of gravity but just the quantum effects associated with the existence of a sub - quantum potential for the cmb , superposed or not to a cosmological constant .",
