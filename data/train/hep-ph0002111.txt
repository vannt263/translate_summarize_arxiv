    "while the first statistically significant observation of cp violation in the b meson system will most likely take place in one of the @xmath0 @xmath1-factory experiments ( babar , belle ) , this talk will try to prove that the contribution from experiments in hadron colliders will be dominant in the future , starting in 2001 .",
    "figure  1 shows the standard cp violation triangle .",
    "the angle @xmath2 is the most easily accessible , in particular through the asymmetry in the decays @xmath3 .",
    "first determinations by cdf  @xcite , opal  @xcite and aleph  @xcite have recently become available .",
    "when combined , they give a two - standard deviation measurement of @xmath4 : @xmath5    the combination is totally dominated by the cdf result . by summer 2000 , the electro - positron colliders should get a measurement with an uncertainty about @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the task is substantially more involved for the other two angles , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is not obvious when will babar or belle be able to obtain a measurement .",
    "hadronic uncertainties diminish the usefulness of a determination of the length of the side of the triangle opposite @xmath2 .",
    "the length of the side opposite @xmath8 , can be obtained from the determination of @xmath9 , the frequency of the oscillations in the @xmath10 system .",
    "the current limit from lep is  @xcite : @xmath11 standard model expectations for @xmath12 are in the range 2030  @xcite . when the determination of @xmath12 will become available",
    ", it will be possible to combine it with @xmath13 , the similar parameter in the @xmath14 system , now measured to be  @xcite @xmath15 in order to obtain the length of the side of the triangle opposite @xmath8 through the relation : @xmath16 since the lepton machines are only scheduled to run at the energy of the @xmath17(4s ) resonance , no @xmath18 mesons will be produced .",
    "therefore , @xmath12 will only be determined in hadron machine experiments .    the standard cp triangle in fig .",
    "1 is the only one obtained from the standard wolfenstein parametrization of the ckm matrix  @xcite .",
    "however , one should remember that this is just an expansion of the complete matrix in powers of @xmath19 , the sinus of the cabibbo angle , valid up to order @xmath20 . if one proceeds with the expansion up to @xmath21 , one encounters a new imaginary contribution to @xmath22 , which gives raise to a new unitarity triangle .",
    "a new angle , @xmath23 , appears , which in the standard model is proportional to @xmath24 , and , therefore , very small , of order @xmath25 .",
    "it is easily accessible through the decay @xmath26 , the @xmath18 equivalent to the `` golden channel '' @xmath27 .",
    "again , this is not possible in the lepton machines , which do not produce @xmath18 .",
    "the experimental program in the coming years has two clear goals :    * first , to observe for the first time cp violation in the b system . as explained above , this",
    "will most likely be achieved by babar and/or belle , followed by hera - b at desy , cdf and d0 .",
    "* then , to test whether cp violation is generated by the standard model . here , all the experiments mentioned before will contribute but , most probably , the second - generation dedicated experiments , lhcb and btev , will be needed .    in the remaining of the talk , the capabilities of the experiments foreseen in future hadron colliders will be reviewed .",
    "section  2 will cover the near future : cdf and d0 at the fermilab tevatron , scheduled to start physics data - taking in spring 2001 .",
    "the more distant future , from 2005 on , will be covered in section  3 .",
    "atlas , cms and lhcb are approved to take data at cern s lhc , while btev , if approved , will run at the tevatron .",
    "special emphasis will be put in the two dedicated @xmath1-experiments , lhcb and btev .",
    "finally , section  4 will give a short summary of the talk .",
    "the upgraded tevatron at fermilab is scheduled to start collider physics operation in spring 2001 with two upgraded detectors , cdf and d0 .",
    "the luminosity delivered in the first two years of operation is expected to reach about 2  fb@xmath28 , which is equivalent to a production of about 10@xmath29 @xmath1 pairs per year .",
    "the challenge in a hadron collider experiments is not producing the @xmath1 pairs , but rather triggering on them , selecting them and getting rid of the background .",
    "cdf has proven to be able to do all this with their recent determination  @xcite @xmath30 using the @xmath31 channel .",
    "both cdf and d0 are undergoing substantial upgrades  @xcite . among other improvements , cdf is getting a new , longer , vertex detector , that will provide 3d coordinates in a larger acceptance region . a new time - of - flight system",
    "will allow kaon identification at low momentum , and can , therefore , be used for kaon tagging : using the kaon charge to decide on the flavor of the decaying @xmath1 hadron .",
    "more importantly , a new pipelined , deadtimeless trigger system will allow purely hadronic events ( no leptons ) to be triggered efficiently .",
    "this will vastly increase the physics capabilities of cdf , as it will be shown later .",
    "the new all - hadron trigger requires two high transverse momentum tracks at level 1 and , using vertex detector information , finds their vertex at level 2 and requires the decay length to be positive .",
    "d0 upgrades are not less important .",
    "the detector will have for the first time a solenoidal coil , with a 2  tesla field that , together , with the new scintillating - fiber central tracking system , will provide precise momentum measurements for all charged tracks .",
    "furthermore , a new four - layer vertex detector will also be added .",
    "these changes should allow d0 to reconstruct and tag b decays using standard displaced vertes techniques .",
    "a comparison between the @xmath1-physics capabilities of cdf and d0 shows a clear advantadge for the former , due , in particular , to its unique all - hadron trigger . in order to trigger on hadronic",
    "b decays , d0 has to rely on semileptonic decays of the opposite - side b hadron , therefore paying the price of the 10% semileptonic branching ratio .      as mentioned in the introduction , the measurement of the mass difference of the two @xmath18 sates , @xmath9 , is needed in order to determine the length of the side of the standard ckm triangle opposite the angle @xmath8 .",
    "the mass difference is obtained from the difference between mixed and unmixed @xmath18 decays as a function of proper time : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the so - called dilution factor , explained later . in order to be able to perform the measurement one needs to determine :    * the proper decay time .",
    "hence good decay length resolution is needed . * the @xmath18 flavor at production time ( tagging ) .",
    "the dilution factor @xmath33 in the previous equation is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the probability of getting the flavor wrong .",
    "* the @xmath18 flavor at decay time , using , for instance , flavor - specific decays .",
    "cdf has studied the flavor - specific decay channel @xmath36 or @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "as one can see , there are no leptons and , therefore , the purely hadronic trigger is mandatory .",
    "cdf expects about 20000 selected events in the first two years of operation with a signal - to - background ratio between 1/2 and 2  @xcite .",
    "the significance of the measurement of @xmath9 ( in number of standard deviations ) or of the related , dimensionless parameter @xmath12 introduced above , is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of selected events , @xmath41 is the tagging efficiency , @xmath33 is the dilution factor , @xmath42 is the proper time resolution , @xmath43 is the @xmath18 lifetime and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the number of signal and background events selected , respectively . looking at the formula , one sees that the `` quality factor '' @xmath46 gives the effective tagging efficiency and that good proper time resolution is , clearly , crucial .",
    "no matter how many events one can collect , the reach in @xmath9 is going to be limited by the time resolution to something of order @xmath47 .",
    "cdf expects a time resolution around 50  fs and a quality factor @xmath48 , which translate into a sensitivity to @xmath49 at the five standard deviation level  @xcite .",
    "this goes well beyond the current lep limit of 21.8 and the expected range in the standard model , from 20 to 30 . in summary",
    ", cdf should be able to determine @xmath12 quite precisely unless it is much larger than expected .",
    "the standard prodecure to determine the angle @xmath2 uses the time integrated asymmetry in the @xmath50 decays to @xmath51 : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is a dilution factor due to @xmath54 mixing .",
    "since @xmath12 is much larger than @xmath13 this dilution factor is very small in the @xmath55 asymmetries , so that time - dependent measurements are needed .",
    "the experimentally observed asymmetry is further diluted by mistagging and background : @xmath56 so that the final uncertainty on @xmath4 can be written as @xmath57    cdf believes they can obtain a total @xmath58 around 9.1  % , including the kaon tagging using the proposed time - of - flight system . with the statistics available in the first two years of data - taking , that would imply @xmath59  @xcite . on the other hand , total @xmath58 for d0",
    "is expected to be around 5.0  % , implying @xmath60 , using only the muon decay of the @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "analyses are underway to quantify the precision attainable in the electron channel",
    ".      determination of cp angles other than @xmath2 can also be attempted by cdf",
    ". it will be more difficult for d0 because of their lack of a fully hadron trigger .",
    "a quick summary of cdf capabilities follows :    * @xmath61 could , in principle , be obtained from the @xmath62 asymmetry in the @xmath63 decay . however , the large penguin contribution , with different phase , my preclude the effective extraction of @xmath7 from this channel .",
    "some other methods will be described in section  3 . in any case",
    ", cdf can have a quality factor around 9.1% for this channel , leading to a precision in the determination of the asymmetry of @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "* there are several ways of studying the angle @xmath8 .",
    "cdf has explored , for instance , the use of the asymmetries in the decays @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the @xmath68 eigenstate of the @xmath69 system . for the moment",
    ", however , there are no quantitative estimates of the possible @xmath70 reach .",
    "* finally , the asymmetry in the decays @xmath71 , the `` golden decay '' equivalent in the @xmath18 sector , can be determined to about 10% by cdf , depending on the value of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry provides a direct determination of @xmath23 .",
    "they expect about 6000 events with @xmath72 .",
    "while only an asymmetry of order a few percent is expected in the standard model , a larger value , if found , would be a sign of new physics .",
    "it should be noted that since in this channel the triggering is based on the leptonic decays of the @xmath31 , d0 should be able to do a similar job .",
    "in about 2005 atlas , cms and lhcb will start taking data at the lhc accelerator at cern . at about the same time , btev , if approved , will start at the tevatron . at that time",
    "a lot of progress will have been made by the earlier experiments , both at hadron machines and at the electron - positron factories .",
    "in particular , one could expect @xmath4 to be measured with a precision around 0.04 by a combination of babar , belle , hera - b , cdf and d0 .",
    "the length of the side opposite @xmath8 will be known thanks to the @xmath18 oscillations measurements at hera - b , cdf and d0 but it is rather unclear the amount of information that will be gathered about @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the outcome of the combination of all the different measurements should be one of the following :    * either a clear inconsistency with the standard model predictions will be seen in the precise measurements ( @xmath2 and @xmath18 mixing ) ; * or a hint of inconsistency with the less precise measurements ( @xmath7 , kaon results ) will appear ; * or all measurements will look consistent with the standard model .    in any case , the next generation of experiments will be needed for a full understanding of the cp violation mechanism . that will involve more precise measurements of the same parameters in the same channels , measuring the same parameters in different channels and determining for the first time some parameters , notably the angle @xmath8 .      around year 2005",
    ", four new hadron - machine experiments with interesting capabilities in @xmath1 physics will start taking data .",
    "two of them are specifically designed for @xmath1 physics , lhcb  @xcite and btev  @xcite .",
    "both of them cover only the forward region , since most of the @xmath73 s produced are in this region .",
    "btev actually covers also the backward region , thus doubling the acceptace . the larger cross section available at lhc energies ( 500  @xmath74b vs.  100@xmath74b ) more than compensates for the smaller acceptance of lhcb . covering only the forward / backward regions",
    "has clear advantages :    * @xmath73 production peaks forward ; * limited solid angle coverage leads to limited cost ; * the @xmath1 hadrons have higher momentum which leads to easier vertex finding and improved decay time resolution ; * open geometry allows for easy installation and maintenance .",
    "these advantadges compensate for the higher minimum bias background , occupancies and radiation dose that have to be overcome at low angles .",
    "the main advantadges that lhcb and btev have over the all - purpose detectors , atlas and cms , are in particle identification and , especially , in the triggering capabilities .",
    "lhcb and btev have rich systems that allow @xmath75 separation in a large momentun range ( @xmath76 for lhcb , @xmath77 gev for btev ) .",
    "this is mandatory to separate signal from background in the @xmath78 channels and adds the possibility of using kaon tagging , as mentioned in chapter  2 for cdf .    both lhcb and btev can trigger efficiently in all - hadron events , thanks to their vertex triggers .",
    "in contrast , atlas and cms need a high-@xmath79 lepton to start the triggering sequence .",
    "this considerably reduces the @xmath1-physics capabilities of the two multipurpose detectors .",
    "the angle @xmath2 can be measured very precisely by the second generation @xmath1 experiments using the same `` golden '' decay used by cdf and d0 : @xmath80 . since the @xmath31 is only reconstructed through its lepton - pair decays ,",
    "the triggering and particle - id advantadges of lhcb and btev are of no importance and the kind of precision that can be achieved by the four experiments is very similar , ranging from @xmath81 for lhcb to @xmath82 for cms  @xcite , with atlas and btev somewhere in between .",
    "the @xmath18 mixing analysis is much improved by the availability of a pure hadron trigger and , therefore , the differences between the reach of the experiments are large . whereas atlas and cms could only reach @xmath12 values around 50  @xcite , lower than what can be explored already at cdf with their hadron trigger",
    ", the dedicated experiments can go up to 60 ( btev ) or 75 ( lhcb )  @xcite .",
    "it should be said , however , that standard model expectations for @xmath12 are in the range 2030 , easily accessible by the first generation experiments .",
    "the asymmetry in the @xmath83 channel has already been mentioned in section  2 as a possibility for measuring @xmath7 , although , at present , its usefulness is not clear due to the large penguin contribution with different phase . in any event , lhcb and btev can measure the asymmetry in this all - hadron channel with a @xmath82 precision  @xcite .",
    "more promising , if more involved , seems to be the @xmath84 channel , which proceeds through @xmath85 intermediate states .",
    "here , all amplitudes can be determined and the remaining ambiguities can be resolved using the intereference regions in the dalitz plot  @xcite .",
    "the analysis seems feasible , but no experiment has yet made public the precision it could achieve in @xmath7 .      there are several ways of getting to the angle @xmath8 , all of them rather challenging .",
    "for example , it can be obtained from the simultaneous measurement of six time - integrated decay rates in the @xmath86 channel : @xmath87 , with @xmath69 decaying to @xmath88 , @xmath89 to @xmath90 , and @xmath67 to either @xmath91 or @xmath63 .",
    "the final state , therefore , consists in all cases in four charged kaons or pions resonating in different masses .",
    "it is clear that proper pion / kaon separation is crucial .",
    "lhcb claims a precision in @xmath8 around 10@xmath92 from this channel  @xcite .",
    "btev has studied a similar channel : @xmath93 , where @xmath69 and @xmath89 go to the same final state , and the corresponding @xmath94 decays .",
    "using now nine time - integrated decays , the precision in @xmath8 is found to be about 13@xmath92  @xcite .",
    "apart from @xmath7 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 , other cp angles are also accessible to the second generation cp experiments :    * the small angle @xmath23 introduced in section  1 can be measured precisely using the @xmath71 asymmetry as already mentioned above .",
    "precisions around @xmath95 seem possible , even for atlas and cms  @xcite , because of the leptonic decays of the @xmath31 . *",
    "the combination @xmath96 can be determined with a precision around 10@xmath92  @xcite by both btev and lhcb through the decay @xmath97 and its charge conjugated .",
    "since @xmath23 is expected to be small in the standard model , this can be viewed as yet another way of getting @xmath8 , only in this case through @xmath18 decays , and , hence , a very interesting check .",
    "* lhcb has also studied the extraction of @xmath98 from @xmath99 .",
    "the precision that can be obtained is around 9@xmath92  @xcite .",
    "again , since @xmath2 will be well known , this method could be used to obtain @xmath8 or @xmath7 .",
    "the ability of measuring a single angle with different processes can be very useful in checking whether the standard model by itself is able to explain cp violation .",
    "this talk has tried to convey the message that hadron machines have a very comprehensive program for understanding the origin of cp violation in the period 20012015 or so , at the tevatron and lhc .    in a first phase , starting in 2001 , cdf and , to a lesser extend , d0 will be able to measure @xmath4 to about 0.07 and study @xmath18 mixing for values of the mixing parameter @xmath12 up to 63 .    in a second phase , from 2005 on , lhcb , btev ,",
    "if approved , plus atlas and cms will improve on @xmath2 and @xmath12 and will be able to determine both @xmath7 and @xmath8 to about 10@xmath92 , thus putting strong constraints on the standard model ability to explain all the phenomenology of cp violation in the @xmath1 sector .",
