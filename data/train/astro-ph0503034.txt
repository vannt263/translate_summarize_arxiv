    "powerful radio galaxies at @xmath3 are often observed to be surrounded by extensive regions of uv / optical continuum and line emission .",
    "the excess continuum emission is generally well aligned with the radio source axis at higher redshifts ( @xmath4 ) , and is known as the _ alignment effect _ ( e.g. chambers , miley & van breugel 1987 ; mccarthy et al 1987 ) .",
    "the extended emission regions responsible for the alignment effect have been well studied in the case of powerful radio galaxies selected from the 3cr sample ( e.g. mccarthy , spinrad & van breugel 1995 ; best , longair & rttgering 1997 ) . whilst a wide range of different features",
    "are observed for the extended emission surrounding this sample of radio galaxies , several clear trends are generally observed . at higher redshifts ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the optical / uv emission is typically brighter than at lower redshifts , and can be more luminous than the host galaxy in some cases .",
    "this emission is also typically more extensive , with projected linear sizes of up to a few hundred kpc , and is far more closely aligned with the radio source axis than is the case for lower redshift systems .",
    "the emission surrounding the less powerful 3cr radio sources at lower redshifts is rarely as extensive , and with the exception of ionization cones produced by the powerful obscured agn , does not usually display any tendency for alignment with the radio axis ( allen _ et al _ 2002 ) . for the high redshift 3cr sources",
    ", the alignment effect also displays a strong trend with radio source size ; smaller sources typically display the most extensive , luminous aligned emission regions ( best , longair & rttgering 1996 ) .",
    "multiwavelength observations have shown that a number of different emission mechanisms are responsible for this extended excess uv / optical emission .",
    "these include extended line emission and nebular continuum radiation ( dickson et al 1995 ) , scattering of the uv continuum from the agn ( e.g. tadhunter et al 1992 ; cimatti et al 1993 ) and young stars produced in a radio jet induced starburst ( mccarthy et al 1987 ) .",
    "the relative contributions of each of these processes vary from source to source , and generally the excess emission can not be accounted for by any single mechanism .",
    "it is clear from the observed trends that not only do different processes vary in importance at different stages of the life of a given radio source , but that the mechanisms which produce the excess emission also vary with redshift .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether this evolution in the properties of the emission regions surrounding the 3cr sources reflects a genuine evolutionary trend with redshift , or if it is instead due to the decreasing radio power of the lower redshift systems . with such strong apparent links between the radio source and the aligned / excess emission , both in terms of the morphology and emission properties of the alignment effect ,",
    "the necessity for breaking this degeneracy is clear .",
    "the 6c sample provides an ideal population of radio galaxies which , in conjunction with the well - studied 3cr sample , can be used to break the degeneracy between redshift and radio source power present in studies of a single flux limited radio galaxy sample . at @xmath5",
    "the 6c radio sources are typically @xmath6 times less powerful than the 3cr sources at the same redshift , and matched in radio power to 3cr sources at lower redshifts of @xmath7 .",
    "deep spectroscopic observations of @xmath2 6c sources have enabled the importance of cosmic epoch and the radio source parameters on the properties of the extended emission line structures to be determined independently ( inskip _ et al _ 2002b ; inskip",
    "_ et al _ 2002c ) .",
    "these studies were able to demonstrate that both radio power and redshift were independently important for the kinematic properties of the gas , but that ionization state only depended on the radio source parameters and not on redshift .",
    "we now intend to use the same samples to address the question of the evolution of the morphological properties of these systems , as many of the mechanisms by which aligned continuum emission can be produced are also highly dependent on the properties of the radio source and agn .    in order to correctly interpret the properties of the aligned emission regions ,",
    "it is also necessary to have a thorough understanding of the host galaxy morphologies .",
    "it is therefore important to determine the structural parameters of the host galaxies precisely , particularly with regard to the presence of an unresolved point source contribution from an incompletely obscured agn . for the later consideration of galaxy colours ,",
    "this agn contribution must be included in the excess uv emission , which does not necessarily originate wholly from any external alignment effect .    at redshifts of up",
    "to at least @xmath2 , the host galaxies of the powerful 3cr radio sources are usually found to be giant ellipticals with characteristic sizes of @xmath8 10 - 12kpc ( blr98 ; mclure & dunlop 2000 ) , and are amongst the most massive galaxies known at high redshifts .",
    "the stellar populations of these galaxies are also amongst the oldest found ; the @xmath9 band magnitude - redshift relation for the most powerful 3cr radio sources is consistent with passively evolving galaxies with old stellar populations formed at @xmath10 or earlier .",
    "more varied morphologies are observed at higher redshifts where the host galaxies may still be in the process of formation ( e.g. pentericci et al 1999 ) .",
    "the 6c radio galaxy sample , selected at a lower limiting radio flux density than the 3cr sample , displays a similar @xmath11 relation at low@xmath1 .",
    "however , beyond @xmath12 , the @xmath9 magnitudes of these sources are typically @xmath13 magnitudes fainter ( eales & rawlings 1996 ) , a variation between the samples which can be interpreted in several ways ( inskip et al 2002a ) .",
    "the more luminous galaxies could have a greater agn contamination in their @xmath9 band magnitudes from direct nuclear light , emission lines or other agn induced emission ; the stellar populations of the different samples could differ in age or metallicity ; or more simply , the less powerful high@xmath1 radio sources could be hosted by less massive galaxies .",
    "a mass difference can be easily understood : if the radio sources are being fuelled at the eddington limit then the radio power depends upon black hole mass , and it is now well established that black hole mass and galaxy mass are correlated ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "an early study of the host galaxies of @xmath2 6c sources ( roche , eales & rawlings 1998 , hereafter rer98 ) suggested that are typically hosted by elliptical galaxies with a far smaller average physical size than 3cr sources at the same redshift .",
    "however , as this result was based upon measurements of galaxy sizes @xmath14 1with 0.5pixels in 1.5seeing conditions , confirmation of this result using improved instrumentation was certainly desirable .",
    "in the first paper in this series ( inskip et al 2003 , _ hereafter paper i _ ) , we presented the results of hst and ukirt imaging observations of a complete sample of @xmath2 6c radio galaxies .",
    "full details of the sample selection and observations are provided within that paper . in this paper",
    ", we study the morphologies of the host galaxies and the aligned emission regions in greater depth .",
    "the results of 2-d modelling of the @xmath15band morphologies of the host galaxies are presented in section 2 , through which we have deduced the structural parameters for the host galaxies , including any contribution from an incompletely obscured nuclear point source component .",
    "the resulting radial profiles , characteristic radii , ellipticity and percentage contribution of unresolved nuclear emission are contrasted with the results of other radio galaxy samples . in section 3 ,",
    "we quantify various properties of the aligned emission on the basis of the elongation and orientation of the rest - frame uv aligned structures visible in our hst observations .",
    "the properties of the 6c subsample are compared with the data for the matched 3cr sample at the same redshift .",
    "the behaviour of the aligned emission is studied as a function of both radio source size and redshift , as well as over the factor of @xmath8six difference in radio power between the two samples . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the range of different morphologies observed in the two samples , and the implications of these combined results . in the third paper in this series , we will present a detailed study of the galaxy colours for both @xmath2 subsamples .",
    "cosmological parameters of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are assumed throughout this paper .",
    "our deep k - band observations of the 6c sources ( with a limiting 1-sigma magnitude of @xmath19 per square arcsec ) are particularly well suited to the study of the host galaxy morphologies , through the fitting of their radial / surface profiles . in order to carry out this fitting , it was first necessary to obtain accurate point source profiles for each of the fields .",
    "the observations for each individual source were carried out over several nights under quite variable seeing conditions ( ranging from 0.4to 1.2 ; see paper i for full details ) .",
    "the point spread functions for each source are therefore quite complex , and are best reproduced by extracting 2-d profiles for all stars in the field of each source , normalising to unit flux and taking the average profile . as a guideline , the average seeing for each source ranges from 0.6to 0.9 , with an mean value for the sample as a whole of 0.75 . in order to accurately model the galaxies ,",
    "nearby objects were masked where these were well separated from the host galaxy ; where this was not possible ( e.g. 6c1100 + 35 , 6c1129 + 37 and 6c1256 + 36 ) a second galaxy and/or point source is included in our modelling to account for the extra flux from the secondary object .",
    "galaxy models were then convolved with these point spread functions and used to fit the surface profiles of the galaxies , using available least squares minimisation idl routines . in particular , we have made use of the idl ( interactive data language ) routine mp2dfunfit.pro , part of the mpfit idl packagecraigm / idl / fitting.html developed by craig markwardt . ] .",
    "the mpfit package iteratively searches for the best fit model parameters via minimisation of the weighted squared difference between the data and model .",
    "this least - squares minimisation uses the levenberg - marquardt technique ( more , 1977 ) , which numerically calculates the derivatives of the assumed function / model via a finite difference approximation ( for further details , see more & wright ( 1993 ) and minpack-1 , available from netlib at http://www.netlib.org ) . in order to weight the data at different radii uniformly , rather than giving preference to either the higher signal to noise data at the centre of each galaxy or the lower signal to noise data at larger radii for which we have more pixels",
    ", we have weighted each pixel by @xmath20 , normalising the weights to a mean value of 1.0 so as not to alter the resulting value of @xmath21 produced by the code .",
    "we have determined that this weighting scheme does not introduce any strong biases into the fitting procedure .",
    "formal 1-sigma uncertainties on each parameter are computed from the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix for the parameters being fitted ; these errors are obtained from the code via the inclusion of an error array , consisting of the measured rms noise of the data divided by the pixel weights .",

    "our own modelling confirms this result , and in general the results of our fitting for a pure de vaucouleurs profile produce very similar best fit effective radii to those of rer98 ( with occasional exceptions such as 6c1129 + 37 which was not previously know to consist of a pair of elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "however , a more representative model of these galaxies should also include an unresolved nuclear point source contribution .",
    "a `` point source fraction '' has been included as an additional free parameter in our modelling of these sources , alongside the effective radius , peak intensity , galaxy centroid and ellipticity .",
    "one issue with this modelling is the potential degeneracy between the shape of the galaxy profile and the derived nuclear point source contribution : a combination of large @xmath46 and high point source contribution often produces a similar reduced @xmath21 value to a smaller galaxy with a much lower point source contribution .",
    "this behaviour of the reduced @xmath21 for various values of @xmath46 and the point source fraction is clearly illustrated and constrained by the shape of our @xmath21 contours in figures 1 - 10 .",
    "we have also considered the slightly more complex srsic profile ( i.e. @xmath47 rather than simply @xmath48 ; srsic 1968 ) for the single galaxy systems in our sample ( i.e. excluding 6c1100 + 35 , 6c1129 + 37 and 6c1256 + 36 ) .",
    "the srsic profile can account for slight variations in the slope of the galaxy profiles compared with the predictions of a de vaucouleurs model .",
    "in particular , a galaxy with a high nuclear point source contribution may in fact be better modelled by a srsic profile with @xmath49 , the steeper slope of which incorporates a higher luminosity for the central regions .",
    "we find that for the majority of our sources a value of @xmath50 is preferred ( although a few sources are better fit by srsic profiles with a higher / lower value of @xmath51 ) , confirming that in general the host galaxies are well behaved elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , the uncertainties on the actual slope of the profiles are not insignificant , and the quality of our data is not sufficient for us to accurately constrain the profile shape ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , size , point source component and other parameters independently . therefore , for ease of comparison with previous datasets and given that @xmath50 is the preferred value , we restrict our detailed analysis to de vaucouleurs elliptical profiles with @xmath52 ; a brief discussion of the effects of deviations from de vaucouleurs profiles is included where relevant in section 2.3 .",
    "tabulated results of our modelling can be found in table 1 , with errors determined as described earlier in this section .",
    "figures 1 - 10 display the following for each source : the k - band galaxy images ( a ) , best - fit model ( after convolution with the appropriate psf ) ( b ) , the residuals obtained after subtracting this model from the original data ( c ) , a radially averaged 1-d profile of these data and best fit model ( d ) and contours representing the reduced @xmath21 ( ideally @xmath53 for an accurate fit ; actual values for each source listed in table 1 ) plus 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 10 ( e ) .",
    "examination of the value of @xmath21 over the local parameter space provides a further check on the accuracy of our fitting ; although these results do not consider the error on the other free parameters , the @xmath54 contours cover a similar range to the 1@xmath55 errors on each parameter deduced as part of the fitting process , and provide a valuable visualisation of the accuracy of our modelling .    as a final test of the accuracy of the fitting procedures ,",
    "the parameters of the best fitting models were used to construct artificial galaxies . after adding noise to the data so as to reproduce the signal  to  noise of the original observations , the same routines were used to fit the parameters of the artificial data . in this way , we have been able to investigate the tendency of the routine to over- or underestimate the value of a given parameter for a particular source , and the range of data which provide consistent results ( i.e. which produce artificial galaxies indistinguishable from the actual object ) .",
    "the range of values given for errors on @xmath46 , @xmath56 and the point source fraction in table 1 agree well with the range of input data which gave results consistent with the observations .",
    "we have repeated the fitting process for our wfpc2 hst observations of a number of 6c sources ( see paper i for details ) , excluding those with the most complicated uv morphologies ( 6c1129 + 37 ) and lowest signal to noise ( 6c0825 + 34 ) .",
    "point spread functions were determined using two methods : firstly by extracting the profiles of unsaturated stellar objects on the wf3 fields , and secondly via the tinytim software .",
    "no significant differences were observed between the data psfs and the tinytim psfs ; the latter were used for this analysis .    for the remaining galaxies ,",
    "we have masked out the regions of the image which contain the aligned emission .",
    "however , this is only practical for emission which is well separated from the host galaxy",
    ". any remaining aligned emission , particularly within the central few arcsec , may potentially skew the fit . for most sources we do obtain good 2-d fits .",
    "but for some others , in spite the high resolution of the hst data , accurate fitting becomes impossible ; this is generally due to the presence of either dust lanes , bright aligned / excess uv emission coincident with the host galaxy , or the low signal to noise of the underlying galaxy . in these cases",
    "the @xmath9-band fits are used to fix the characteristic radius ; this allows the best - fit nuclear point source contribution to be determined , and also permits a clear examination of the excess uv emission .",
    "the resulting models / residuals produced by this analysis are displayed in figures 1 - 10 , and the overall fit parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "one potential pitfall of this approach is that the observed effective radii of such galaxies may vary with wavelength .",
    "the host galaxies of powerful radio sources typically display bluer colours than those of other elliptical galaxies ; in addition to the obvious effects of a nuclear point source or the alignment effect , excess blue emission may be spatially extended throughout the galaxy ( e.g. smith & heckman 1989 ; govoni et al 2000 ) .",
    "there is also some evidence that powerful radio galaxies become bluer towards their centres , contrary to the behaviour of normal elliptical galaxies ( mahabal , kembhavi & mccarthy 1999 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the effective radii of the galaxies modelled in the rest frame uv would be smaller than those measured using our longer wavelength @xmath9-band observations , and the resulting nuclear point source contributions could have been overestimated .",
    "6c0825 + 34 , at a redshift of z=1.47 , is the most distant source of the sample .",
    "the signal  to  noise level for this source is the lowest in the sample , and fitting a simple de vaucouleurs profile suggests an effective radius of 0.2@xmath220.05 . however , if we also allow the inclusion of a nuclear point source contribution , neither the effective radius nor the point source fraction can be accurately constrained . the rest - frame uv image of this galaxy ( which shows a small , faint galaxy with a secondary emission peak aligned with the radio source axis ; inskip et al 2003 ) does not provide much help in accurately constraining the structural parameters of this object .",
    "fitting this galaxy solely with a simple de vaucouleurs elliptical galaxy profile results in a best fit effective radius of 0.15 , which is in good agreement with the value of @xmath57given by the previous fitting of rer98 .",
    "however , the data greatly favour a fit including a nuclear point source contribution ; the best fit values being an effective radius of @xmath58and a point source percentage of 41.5% .",
    "profile fitting of the wfpc2 observations of this source is not possible , due to the extensive aligned emission surrounding this source .",
    "however , fitting using the best - fit value of @xmath46 already obtained from our ir data suggests a point source contribution in the f702w filter of 36% ; the subtraction of this model galaxy & point source does not leave any obvious residual features other than the aligned emission already apparent in the images ( table 1 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : 1 ] ) .      once again , although the fit obtained with a pure de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath59 ) was in good agreement with the rer98 result ( @xmath60 ) , the best fit for 6c1011 + 36 also consists of a combination of point source ( 28.8% ) and elliptical galaxy ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the aligned emission surrounding this source is particularly luminous and difficult to completely mask , rendering a fit of the rest frame uv morphology impractical . using the @xmath9-band effective radius suggests a point source contribution of 25% .",
    "after subtraction of the model galaxy , both the luminous aligned emission to the north west of the galaxy and fainter emission to the south are clearly visible in the residual image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : 2 ] ) .",
    "this galaxy was relatively easy to fit , and our resulting value of @xmath62is again in close agreement with the rer98 value ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "we have also carried out profile fitting of the wfpc2 observations of this source , masking out the aligned emission as well as possible .",
    "the resulting fit is in good agreement with that of our ir data , giving an effective radius of 0.28and a point source contribution of 12% .",
    "however , we believe this larger size may reflect incomplete masking of aligned emission very close to the host galaxy . fixing the effective radius at @xmath62suggests a slightly lower point source contribution of 9% ; the full structure of the aligned emission is clearly visible in the residual image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : 3 ] ) .",
    "in addition to lying at the lowest redshift in the sample ( @xmath64 ) , the ukirt and hst images of 6c1019 + 39 show it to have the most noticeable ellipticity of the galaxies in this sample . fitting the @xmath9-band data",
    "clearly rules out any significant point source contribution , but also suggests a rather large ellipticity of 0.69 , and an effective radius of 1.18along the major axis .",
    "( however , we see little change if we fit over a range of @xmath56 : the effective radius converges to a minimum value of 1.0as @xmath65 and the model galaxy becomes spherical . )",
    "similar results are obtained for all three parameters using the hst data , which suggest effective radii of 1.16and 1.04for the f606w and f814w filters respectively . the residual image also allows us to see several faint clumps of excess uv emission surrounding this galaxy ; although this source displays very little aligned emission , it does possess very luminous line emission likely triggered by a combination of both agn photoionization and shocks associated with the radio source ( inskip et al 2002b ) .      along with 6c0825 + 34 and 6c1204 + 35 , this source is one of the three higher redshift sources in the sample . due to the unusually strong radio emission along the jet axis on one side of this source ,",
    "it is plausible that this source may be orientated closer to the line of sight than the average for this sample , and a high point source contribution would therefore not be unexpected . due to the close proximity of a second object",
    ", we fit both objects together .",
    "the resulting best fit suggests a galaxy with @xmath66with a point source contribution of @xmath67% .    as this source displays no obvious aligned emission ,",
    "it is also useful to repeat the fitting process for the hst data .",
    "however given the strong point source contribution to 6c1100 + 35 in the rest - frame uv and the relatively small sizes of both sources , we unfortunately find that the effective radius and point source contribution become considerably degenerate .",
    "using the best fitting results obtained from our @xmath15band observations gives a maximum point source contribution in the f814w filter of 41% .      our @xmath15band image of this source",
    "clearly reveal a pair of elliptical galaxies , of roughly similar luminosity . as was the case for 6c1100 + 35 ,",
    "these two galaxies need to be fitted simultaneously , giving a best fit value of 1.8for the radio galaxy and a point source contribution of 18% . due to the extreme aligned emission surrounding this source in the rest frame",
    "uv , accurate fitting of our hst data is not possible .",
    "we have however attempted the removal of the host galaxy assuming the @xmath9-band effective radius and zero point source , to permit examination of the remaining aligned emission ( fig .",
    "6 g ) .      for this source",
    ", we find best fit values of @xmath68and a point source fraction of 13% ( our results for a pure de vaucouleurs profile with zero point source are again in good agreement with the rer98 results , 0.45cf .",
    "@xmath69 ) .",
    "the wfpc2 observations of 6c1204 + 35 can not be easily fitted .",
    "[ fig : 7 ] displays the residuals produced after fitting this galaxy with the best - fit effective radius found for the ir data .",
    "these clearly show that there is either a dust lane / disk lying across the galaxy perpendicular to the radio axis , or ( perhaps less likely ) bright aligned emission lying along the radio axis through the centre of the galaxy .",
    "interestingly , srsic profile fitting of the @xmath9 band observations of this system imply values of @xmath70 , @xmath71and a higher point source contribution of 22% .",
    "this suggests that although the nuclear emission is strong , the emission in the inner ( @xmath72 ) regions of the host galaxy has a shallower profile than a de vaucouleurs elliptical , perhaps due in part to dust extinction .      once again",
    ", although our pure de vaucouleurs profile fit ( @xmath73 ) is in good agreement with the rer98 fit ( @xmath74 ) , the data very much favour an additional point source contribution , giving best fit values of @xmath75and 25% .",
    "srsic profile fitting of this source predicts @xmath76 , a similar point source contribution of 22% and a somewhat larger @xmath77 .",
    "we also expect a high point source contribution in our hst images , based on the very blue colours of this source coupled with the lack of any large scale aligned emission .",
    "point source contribution and effective radius again prove difficult to disentangle from our hst images . given the excess emission visible in the residual image ( offset slightly to the north from the centre of the galaxy ) , and the low signal to noise of the underlying host galaxy , this is hardly surprising .",
    "this source displays the most elongated @xmath9-band morphology ; the major question for this source is whether this elongation is due to a strong @xmath9-band alignment effect ( such as that seen for some sources in the more powerful 3cr subsample of best et al 1997 ) , the natural elongation of the elliptical host galaxy , a close pair of galaxies , or a single galaxy combined with an unresolved point source .",
    "single object fits could not provide an adequate fit to the data , but much better fits were obtained fitting two objects simultaneously .",
    "the positions of the two components in the @xmath9-band are coincident with the two peaks visible in our hst image .",

    "overall , this stellar object has a flux equivalent to roughly 34% of the total @xmath9-band flux from this galaxy ( i.e. a 25% contribution to the aperture flux for this object ) . whilst the point - like nature of the adjacent object ( hereafter assumed to be a foreground star ) is clear from the wfpc2 observations of this source , the host galaxy itself is relatively faint and is not well suited to profile fitting .",
    "fitting using the best - fit parameters of the ir imaging produces negligible residuals ; in this case the flux of the adjacent object accounts for 17% of the total flux in the aperture ( i.e. equivalent to 20% of the flux from the galaxy itself ) .      as is the case for the majority of our objects the best fit for this object consists of a combination of elliptical galaxy ( @xmath78 ) and nuclear point source ( 16% )",
    "; if we exclude the point source contribution ( which clearly gives a much worse fit than the models including a point source ) the suggested effective radius ( 0.55 ) is similar to ( although somewhat higher than ) the rer98 value ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "fitting this system with a srsic profile suggests values of @xmath80 , @xmath81and a point source contribution of 12% . the presence of excess uv emission to the north of the galaxy ( as well as to the east , as can be seen in the residual images : fig .",
    "[ fig : 10 ] ) makes fitting the hst images less straightforward ; with the exception of these features , the effective radius implied by the @xmath15band fitting seems to provide a reasonable fit , suggesting point source contributions of 11% in the f606w filter , and 3.5% in the f814w filter .",
    "analysis of the radio galaxy @xmath11 relation ( inskip et al 2002a ) shows that whilst the 6c and 3cr galaxy populations are indistinguishable at low redshifts , the two populations differ in their mean magnitude by approximately @xmath82mag at higher redshifts . if galaxy mass is the sole cause of this difference between the samples , the more powerful radio sources would be expected to be hosted by @xmath83% larger elliptical galaxies .",

    "a summary of the key results from a number of different studies of radio galaxy samples at different redshifts and radio powers has been collated in table 2 .",
    "although not statistically significant , the average effective radii found for these data are typically somewhat larger than those of our 6c subsample . continuing the comparison with lower redshift 3cr galaxies , matched in radio power to the @xmath2 6c subsample ( e.g. mclure et al ( 1999 ) ; roche & eales ( 2000 ) ) ,",
    "the emerging picture is that a radio source similar to our @xmath2 6c sample in power will be hosted by a @xmath0kpc elliptical galaxy regardless of the cosmic epoch at which it exists .",
    "although galaxy mass may play some role in explaining the drop in @xmath9-band luminosity between the 6c/3cr samples , it seems that it can not account for it completely .    despite this",
    ", there is still some evidence in favour of a mass  radio luminosity relationship .",
    "mclure et al ( 2004 ) provide an analysis of four radio galaxy samples of different powers at @xmath90 .",
    "for these data , the 3cr sources were found to have larger sizes ( median 17.9kpc ) than the 6c sources ( 13.3kpc ) , which were in turn more massive than the still less powerful 7crs ( 11.2kpc ) and toot ( 11.0kpc ) radio sources , suggesting a weak correlation between radio luminosity and bluge / black hole mass within their @xmath90 sample .",
    "k  s tests on these data confirm that the 3cr sources are indeed larger on average than the 6c/7crs / toot sources at a signifcance level of @xmath91% .",
    "there is no significant size difference between the 3cr and 6c data alone , or between the 6c sources and the lower radio power 7crs / toot sources , emphasising the weakness of this trend and the ease with which it can be swamped by the relatively large scatter in galaxy properties within each sample .",
    "the 6c galaxies at @xmath90 appear to be larger on average than those at @xmath2 , which if truly representative of evolution in the galaxy properties , could indicate continued growth ( e.g. via mergers ) of the host galaxy population at @xmath92 .",
    "however , the @xmath93 sources appear comparable in size to those at @xmath2 , which suggests that the larger sizes of the @xmath94 sources may simply be anomalous . we have also plotted the data presented in table 2 as a function of redshift ( fig .",
    "[ fig : grow ] ) .",
    "the scatter in the data is large , and we have not included any systematic errors arising from the different methods and quality of datasets used . however ,",
    "this plot does provide a useful illustration of an apparent gradual growth of the host galaxy population , from @xmath95 up to at least @xmath2 , perhaps continuing to later times .",
    "a final interesting point of note is that given that any difference between the 6c and 3cr host galaxy masses is far less than their difference in radio power ( a factor of @xmath96 at @xmath2 ) , it might be expected that the contribution from a nuclear point source would on average be lower for the 6c sources ; this assumes that any unresolved nuclear emission associated with the agn scales with radio power .",
    "we find mean point source contributions of @xmath97% and @xmath98 for the 6c and 3cr samples respectively .",
    "surprisingly , kolmogorov - smirnov tests show that the greater relative point source contribution for the 6c data is in fact weakly significant at the 90% level , although due to the small sample size this result could be dominated by one or two objects .",
    "interestingly , if we compare the core ",
    "lobe ratio of radio flux between the 6c and 3cr subsamples ( best _ et al _ 1997b , best _ et al _ 1999 ) , the values obtained are very different .",
    "the 6c sources have an average core flux fraction of 0.026 ( excluding the very high core fraction of the unusual radio source 6c1217 + 36 ) , whereas the mean 3cr galaxy core fraction is 0.0045 .",
    "this could imply that the 6c sources are observed at an angle closer to the line of sight than the 3cr sources , and the agn are less heavily obscured , thereby increasing the point source contributions to the observed 6c magnitudes .",
    "the unresolved point source emission observed in many of the galaxies in our sample may be due to several processes : the agn itself , nuclear emission lines or an associated unresolved nuclear starburst .",
    "we have compared the nuclear point source contributions in the 6c and 3cr @xmath2 samples with the emission line luminosities of our spectroscopic observations ( inskip et al 2002b , c ; best et al 2000a , b ) , and find no correlation .",
    "this suggests that nuclear emission lines are unlikely to be responsible for the observed point source emission .",
    "our data do not allow us to distinguish between the other two possibilities of agn or nuclear starburst .",
    "the impact of this nuclear point source emission on the galaxy colours will be considered further in paper iii of this series .",
    "the aligned structures surrounding 6c and 3cr radio galaxies at @xmath99 display a wide variety of different features .",
    "the most luminous features observed are bright knots of continuum emission ; these are seen near several galaxies ( e.g. 6c1011 + 36 , 6c1129 + 37 , 3c356 , 3c368 and others ) .",
    "another type of prominent feature often observed is a bright arc - like structure , extending from the host galaxy , and occasionally linked to other bright features .",
    "a particularly good example of such an arc can be seen in images of 3c280 ; arcs are also observed in the hst images of 6c1017 + 37 and 6c1204 + 35 . a third 6c radio source , 6c1257 + 36 , displays a small , very blue arc  like structure , apparently associated with a bright knot in the radio emission ( paper i ) .",
    "fainter linear structures , or filaments of diffuse emission can be seen near , for example , 6c0943 + 39 and 3c352 .",
    "other commonly observed features are faint linear extensions or tails projecting out from the host galaxy , such as those observed in images of 6c0825 + 34 and 3c22 .",
    "these are not however due to optical emission from a radio jet . in general ,",
    "some amount of faint diffuse emission is observed around the majority of sources .",
    "usually , each source exhibits one or more of these distinct features . whilst some sources appear completely passive ( e.g. 6c1100 + 35 , 6c1217 + 36 and 3c65 ) , after subtraction of the best - fit host galaxy model we often see signs of excess emission towards or offset from the centre of the host galaxy in the residual image ( e.g. 6c1217 + 36 in particular ) .",
    "in addition to the aligned emission observed around these sources , the appearance of several galaxies suggests that the uv emission from these sources has been affected by the presence of dust .",
    "extensive dust lanes lying perpendicular to the radio axis , such as those observed in uv imaging observations of low redshift radio galaxies ( allen et al 2002 ; de koff et al 1996 ) , could plausibly explain certain morphological features of the host galaxies of high redshift radio sources such as 3c252 & 3c324 ( best et al 1997 ; longair , best & rttgering 1995 ) , 6c1204 + 35 , and at still lower radio powers , 7c1748 + 6731 ( lacy et al 1999 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that although the presence of a dusk disk could create the false appearance of a small scale alignment effect , this is only likely to be the case for a single object in our sample , 6c1204 + 35 .",
    "the final feature revealed by the imaging observations is the presence of other nearby galaxies which may lie at the same redshift .",
    "four of the eleven 6c sources have companion galaxies at a close projected distance ( @xmath100kpc ; _ see paper i in this series _ ) ; a few of these sources clearly seem likely to be interacting with their companions .",
    "similarly , a number of the @xmath2 3cr sources appear to have nearby companions ( best 1996 ) ; in several cases companion galaxies show evidence ( e.g. increased star formation ) for having been perturbed by the growing radio source .",
    "this issue will be discussed in more depth in paper iii of this series .    whilst the infrared emission of the @xmath2 3cr host galaxies has been found to show a weak alignment effect ( zirm , dickinson & dey 2003 ; blr98 and references therein )",
    ", we do not see any noticeable alignment in the @xmath9-band for our 6c subsample ( nor is one seen in the case of low redshift 3cr sources ( de koff et al 1996 ; martel et al 1999 ) , for which the alignment effect is weaker than at high redshifts at all wavelengths ) .",
    "the percentage contribution of the ir aligned component at high redshifts is known to be relatively low in any case : blr98 and rigler et al ( 1992 ) find typical contributions of 11% and 10% of the total ir flux respectively .",
    "although this in itself is insufficient to account for the @xmath9-band magnitude difference between the @xmath2 6c and 3cr samples , the infrared aligned component is still notable by its absence in the 6c subsample .    having modelled the galaxy morphologies , the simplest method of quantifying the aligned emission is to evaluate the residual flux within some aperture . for the sources for which we have adequate galaxy models in the rest frame uv",

    "the component alignment strengths for the 6c and 3cr galaxies are plotted as a function of redshift and radio power in fig .",
    "[ fig : 7_7 ] .",
    "once again , similar trends are observed for both the 6c and 3cr galaxies , with a peak in the component alignment strength at @xmath154 .",
    "the slight decrease beyond this redshift is due to the decreasing sensitivity of the higher redshift observations .",
    "any anti - correlation with radio size is weaker , and is statistically insignificant .",
    "we again see a strong ( @xmath155% significant ) correlation between component alignment strength and the excess uv flux in our residual images ( again excluding 6c1129 + 37 ) .",
    "the component alignment strengths of the 6c sources are generally much lower than those of the 3cr sources , and where a value of @xmath156 is observed in the 6c sample , this is not so clearly biased towards smaller radio sources as is seen for the 3cr sources .",
    "multiple bright knots of emission are rarer in the 6c data ( table 5 ) : at @xmath2 the average number of bright components is 1.7 for the 6c sample , and 2.7 for the 3cr sample .",
    "although 6c and 3cr sources at the same redshift have similar values for the measured strength of the alignment effect , the measured component alignment strengths were generally less for the 6c sample .",
    "the extended structures of the 3cr sources are clearly more `` knotty '' on average than 6c sources of a similar radio size .",
    "it is also interesting that where large number of discrete components are seen , their spatial distributions are similar in both samples , regardless of radio power .",
    "the differences between the 6c and 3cr samples become clearer when we consider a restricted redshift range .",
    "[ fig : 7_8 ] displays the variation in alignment strength and component alignment strength with radio size , for the sources in the redshift range @xmath157 . at these redshifts ,",
    "the alignment effect has generally reached its maximum observed strength , but the data do not yet suffer from high redshift sensitivity problems .",
    "the alignment strengths for the 3cr data are anti - correlated with radio size at a significance level of @xmath158 ; adding the 6c data increases this to @xmath159 . whilst both the 6c and 3cr sources show a very similar result for the variation in @xmath130 with radio size , the results for @xmath152 clearly show that the smaller 6c sources lack the knotty structures observed in the 3cr sample .",
    "the 3cr sources show a 99% significant anti - correlation between @xmath152 and radio size ; the strength of this correlation is reduced to @xmath160 with the inclusion of the 6c data points .",
    "if the emission which produces the bright knots of emission is due to line or nebular continuum emission , the more powerful 3cr sources should indeed display these features more frequently .",
    "however , an analysis of the data for two of the sources in the 6c subsample shows that whilst the diffuse extended emission surrounding 6c0943 + 39 is dominated by line emission , only a small fraction of the bright knotty emission surrounding 6c1129 + 37 can be attributed to such processes .",
    "this result implies that other mechanisms are responsible for the bright knotty emission predominantly observed around the smaller radio sources .",
    "the evolution with radio source size of the 3cr aligned emission has previously been interpreted as being consistent with the effects of the aging of a young stellar population , whose formation was triggered by the passage of the expanding radio source ( best , longair & rttgering 1996 ) .",
    "should this indeed be the case , the morphological differences between the aligned emission in the 6c & 3cr subsamples suggests that the drop in radio power has implications for the efficiency and/or outcome of these processes .",
    "ccc correlation using observed 6c eelr sizes & @xmath130 & @xmath152 + full data & @xmath161% & @xmath162% + data with @xmath163 & @xmath162% & @xmath162% +   + correlation using corrected 6c eelr sizes & @xmath130 & @xmath152 + full data & @xmath162% & @xmath164% + data with @xmath163 & @xmath165% & @xmath165% +    it is particularly useful to contrast our imaging with the results of our spectroscopic observations of the 6c and 3cr @xmath2 subsamples ( best , rttgering & longair 2000a , b ; inskip et al 2002b , c ) .",
    "to summarize , the spectra of these sources show that the ionization state and kinematic properties of the gas in the extended emission line regions ( eelrs ) vary independently with both radio power and size .",
    "the eelrs of smaller radio sources are more luminous and extensive , and are best explained by a contribution from shock ionization associated with the expanding radio source as well as from agn photoionization .",
    "partial rank analysis of 6c and 3c spectra ( inskip et al 2002c ) showed that the gas kinematics are also more extreme for the sources at higher redshifts , independently of the effects of radio source power and size / age .",
    "these results suggest that there is some evolution of the local intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and that either the distribution and density of gas clouds varies with redshift , or that interactions / shocks between the igm and the radio source are less important at later cosmic epochs . whilst the alignment effect is often observed around lower redshift sources , it is generally less extreme than that surrounding high-@xmath166 sources of similar radio power ( allen et al 2002 , dey & van breugel 1993 ) , indicating clear evolution in the mechanisms which produce the alignment effect as well as the expected dependence on radio power .",
    "the properties of the eelrs seem to be closely linked to the alignment effect .",
    "the small radio sources in both samples which do not show a strong uv alignment effect are usually those which have passive , quiescent emission line regions .",
    "however , where shocks are seen to boost the emission line luminosity , kinematics and overall extent of the emission region , we also find that these sources often display a strong alignment effect .",
    "although the extended line emission does not account for a large proportion of the total flux observed in the rest frame uv ( typically a few percent up to a maximum of 20% in some sources ) , the sources which display the most extreme alignment effect also have the largest emission line regions : a feature which is itself closely linked to the importance of shocks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : 7_9 ] ) . both @xmath130 & @xmath152",
    "are correlated with emission line region size ( details in table 6 ) .",
    "these correlations are strengthened if we either restrict the data to the matched set of objects lying between @xmath163 , or if we scale the 6c emission line region sizes upwards by 25% to reflect the lower sensitivity of the spectroscopic observations ( inskip et al 2002b ) .",
    "there is a clear change between the sources which show a strong alignment effect when small and young , to the more passive evolved sources that they will become at later times .",
    "this trend for alignment strength and component alignment strength in particular to be correlated with emission line region size is actually stronger than that with radio size . despite the fact that the trends with radio size for the alignment effect are weaker for the 6c sample , this is a good indication that the underlying trends observed for the 3cr galaxies still hold true at lower radio powers , and that the presence of shocks in the extended emission regions may be a driving factor in producing the most extreme alignment effects .",
    "the analysis of the morphologies and alignment strengths of @xmath2 6c and 3cr radio galaxies has led to a number of interesting results .    1 .",
    "the 6c host galaxies at @xmath2 are best described as de vaucouleurs ellipticals .",
    "fitting with srsic profiles gives a mean value of @xmath50 for the sample ; the range of values determined for @xmath51 ( @xmath167 ) is comparable to that found by zirm , dickinson & dey ( 2003 ) in their similar analysis of 3cr sources at @xmath2 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the two sources which have @xmath49 are amongst the three most luminous in the sample ; larger values of @xmath51 are frequently observed to be correlated with the mass / luminosity of the host galaxy ( e.g. graham & guzmn 2003 ) .",
    "2 .   typically",
    ", the 6c sources have effective radii of @xmath168kpc and an average unresolved nuclear point source contribution of 16% in the @xmath9-band .",
    "the values of these parameters are comparable to those of low redshift radio galaxies matched in radio power , and also to more powerful radio sources at the same redshift .",
    "3 .   the measured alignment strengths , and the variations in this parameter with both redshift and radio size are almost identical for both the 6c and 3cr @xmath2 subsamples .",
    "both @xmath130 and @xmath152 peak at a redshift of @xmath169 , and are anti - correlated with radio source size .",
    "similar ellipticities are measured for the smoothed images , and the extended structures are equally well aligned with the radio axis .",
    "4 .   on average ,",
    "the component alignment strength is lower for the 6c sources .",
    "these display fewer bright components , and their aligned structures are generally less extensive .",
    "however , for sources matched in radio power , the higher redshift sources display a stronger alignment effect .",
    "this reflects the decreasing importance of interactions at low redshifts , and also the possible evolution of the distribution of material in the surrounding igm .",
    "the observed trend for the smaller 3cr sources to display brighter , more extensive and better aligned morphologies ( best _ et al _ 1996 ) is clearly not as strong for the galaxies in the 6c subsample , which generally have less extreme morphologies .",
    "regardless of radio size , the sources which display an extreme alignment effect also have the most extensive emission regions ; these are the sources for which shocks are most important .",
    "our results add further weight to the picture that the various features of the alignment effect depend strongly on both redshift and radio source power .",
    "radio power remains an important factor at lower redshifts , as is evident from the study of a sample of still less powerful 7c radio galaxies at @xmath170 ( lacy et al 1999 ) .",
    "for the 7c systems , aligned emission is still observed , but is substantially weaker than that of the matched sample of more powerful 3cr sources at the same redshift .",
    "the percentage aligned flux is found to be lower ( 7% for 7c cf .",
    "18% for 3c , at wavelengths slightly longer than the 4000  break ) , and the excess emission exists on smaller spatial scales than for the higher radio luminosity 3cr sources at the same redshift .",
    "additionally , neither sample displays any trends between alignment effect and radio source size ; the luminous clumpy features most likely to be responsible for the radio size trends observed in the 3cr @xmath99 subsample are far less common at lower redshifts and/or radio powers . in terms of evolution with redshift ,",
    "the 6c alignment effect at @xmath2 is more frequent and noticeably stronger than that observed for galaxies of a similar radio luminosity at lower redshift .",
    "dey & van breugel ( 1993 ) observed significant uv alignment effects in only 30% of low redshift systems ; similar results are seen in other low redshift studies ( e.g. de koff et al 1996 ) .",
    "given that the alignment effect clearly varies in strength with radio source power as well as redshift , one might expect its behaviour to be predictable",
    ". of the various mechanisms proposed to explain the alignment effect , several should scale with radio power .",
    "[ oii ] emission and the bulk kinetic power of the radio jet are both observed to scale with radio source luminosity to the power of @xmath86/7 , over a wide range of source powers and redshifts ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ; willott et al 1999 ) .",
    "scattered agn emission and total line emission are therefore also expected to increase with the power of the radio source . on the other hand , star formation induced by the passage of the radio source jets",
    "may be favoured in the case of lower power radio sources ( perhaps explaining the strong alignment effects observed in the case of the high redshift 6c sources ) , where the bulk kinetic energy carried by the jets is correspondingly lower ( lacy et al 1999 ) .",
    "however , this does not rule out star formation induced by lower velocity bulk motions associated with backflows or the sideways expansion of the radio cocoon in the case of more powerful sources . given the strong alignment effects observed for both @xmath2 subsamples , the optical / uv alignment effect clearly depends on a number of other factors in addition to radio power , which themselves become unable to induce such a strong alignment effect at lower redshifts .",
    "the emission at longer wavelengths is also worthy of further discussion .",
    "the lack of any ir alignment effect in our 6c subsample suggests that the long wavelength tail of the alignment effect does indeed scale most strongly with radio power .",
    "however , the long - wavelength alignment effect can not account for differences in @xmath9-band emission between the 6c and 3cr samples , nor is it sufficient to explain the fact that the host galaxies of high redshift radio sources are more luminous than expected based on the predictions of passive evolution models ( inskip et al 2002a ) .",
    "the strength of any nuclear point source contribution can not be responsible , as the point source percentage in the @xmath9-band is similar for both @xmath2 samples , regardless of radio power .",
    "variations in @xmath9-band luminosity can not easily be explained by host galaxy mass either ; the 6c host galaxies are massive ellipticals very similar in size to those of other radio galaxy samples matched in either radio power or redshift . below @xmath95",
    ", the radio source host galaxy population appears remarkably uniform , with scale sizes in the region of 10kpc : well below those of brightest cluster galaxies , but still larger than is typical for normal low redshift ellipticals .",
    "this is in good agreement with the apparent passive evolution of the lower power radio sources in the @xmath9-band magnitude ",
    "redshift ( discussed in detail in inskip et al 2002a ) .",
    "the only remaining possibility is a significant proportion of young stars in the host galaxies of the more powerful sources .",
    "the problem with this approach is that the presence of a young stellar population of @xmath171years in age is itself constrained by the shorter wavelength galaxy colours to a fairly limited proportion of the host galaxy total stellar mass ( @xmath172% , equivalent to a maximum 0.5mag increase in @xmath9-band luminosity ; blr98 & inskip et al 2002a ) .",
    "however , recent research ( e.g tadhunter et al 2002 ; wills et al 2002 ; tadhunter et al 2005 ) has identified the clear presence of older ( 0.1 - 2gyr ) , often reddened , young stellar populations , which could provide an increase in the observed ir emission without overly boosting the rest - frame uv beyond the observational limits .",
    "such a scenario would also fit in well with the recent results from the sloan digital sky survey , which found that the highest luminosity agn were hosted by galaxies with relatively young stellar populations ( kauffmann et al 2003 ) .",
    "we have investigated the influence of un - reddened young stellar populations on the galaxy emission . using the gissel spectral synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 )",
    ", we find that in order to produce a 0.5mag increase in @xmath9-band magnitude whilst avoiding large increases in the rest - frame uv emission from the host galaxy , the young stellar population is required to contain @xmath173% of the host galaxy mass and be over 0.5gyr in age , i.e. significantly older than the radio source .",
    "such an age could argue against any direct link with radio source power , and it is not obvious that this could explain any @xmath9-band magnitude difference between the 6c and 3cr data .",
    "however , if such a starburst was associated with a merger event which led to the subsequent triggering of the radio source / agn activity , then the exact details of that merger could provide a link between any young stellar population and the power of the resulting radio source .",
    "it is also possible that the more diffuse aligned emission ( which displays less radio power dependence ) could be associated with such older , merger - related starbursts .",
    "west ( 1994 ) suggests that mergers occur anisotropically and that the radio source jets are likely to be orientated in alignment with the surrounding matter distribution , thereby leading to an alignment with a young stellar population which could be older than the radio source itself . on top of this ,",
    "other processes ( including later radio source / jet - induced star formation ) would be responsible for producing the more luminous , clumpy aligned emission , which does show a strong dependence on both radio source power and age .",
    "in addition to a strong uv excess , such very recent star formation ( @xmath174 to @xmath175 years in age ) could also generate an increase in flux at longer wavelengths sufficient to explain the fact that these galaxies are typically 0.5mag brighter than the predictions for purely passively evolving systems at @xmath2 ( inskip et al 2002a ) .",
    "however , for consistency with our observed data , for most sources such a young starburst would be limited to a few percent of the total galaxy mass , and would need to be reddened by an e(b - v ) of typically 0.2 - 0.6 .",
    "these issues will be considered in greater depth in paper iii of this series .",
    "we expect that the most likely solution for explaining the evolution of the @xmath9-band galaxy properties is a combination of several factors : smaller variations in galaxy mass , recent star formation and contamination by processes associated with the radio source activity / alignment effect . at higher redshifts ,",
    "it is likely that increased merger activity goes hand in hand with the presence of powerful radio galaxies and ongoing star formation ( e.g. studies of ultraluminous infrared galaxies : genzel et al 2001 ; tacconi et al 2002 ; bushouse et al 2002 ) .",
    "the morphologies of high redshift ( @xmath176 ) radio sources are clearly disturbed , multi - component systems , whilst at slightly lower redshifts ( @xmath95 ) although the galaxies give the appearance of settled elliptical systems , their typical scale sizes ( @xmath6kpc ) are very much smaller than those of radio sources at @xmath2 ( pentericci et al 1999 ; van breugel et al 1998 ) , suggesting that they have not yet completed their process of assembly .",
    "it is certainly plausible that such processes are still affecting the lower redshift @xmath177 systems on a smaller scale , but more so in the case of the most luminous radio sources such as the @xmath2 3cr galaxies , which also display the most extreme examples of the alignment effect .",

    "<S> cosmic epoch is clearly just as important a factor as radio power : although aligned emission is observed on smaller scales at lower redshifts , the processes which produce the most extreme features simply no longer occur , suggesting considerable evolution in the properties of the extended haloes surrounding the radio source .    # 1to 0pt#1    [ firstpage ]    galaxies : active  galaxies : evolution  galaxies : ism  radio continuum : galaxies </S>"
