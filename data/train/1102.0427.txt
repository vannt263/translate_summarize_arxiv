    "for example , a standing wave produced by two counterpropagating em waves with wavelength @xmath13 nm and a very modest , nonrelativistic peak field intensity of @xmath14 w/@xmath11 , already causes ponderomotive forces of the order of @xmath15 gv / m . for this reason , a number of applications of the ponderomotive force",

    "+ in view of all these important technological applications , a thorough understanding of the ponderomotive force in a standing wave is essential . the scattering of charged particles by a standing em wave was first described in a quantum - mechanical context by kapitza and dirac @xcite , and since then many papers have appeared on this subject @xcite . nevertheless , there are only few classical electrodynamical studies on the standing wave ponderomotive force @xcite .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) is also applied to the standing wave configuration , implicitly assuming that it remains valid in that case as well . in 2005 , however , kaplan and pokrovsky @xcite calculated the time - averaged equation of motion of an electron in a standing wave for a number of field polarizations , and their results showed that the ponderomotive force depends on the polarization .",
    "most notably , the ponderomotive force can even change its direction toward high field regions for certain situations . clearly , these results are in conflict with the polarization - independent eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) that is commonly used .",
    "kaplan and pokrovsky did not provide an alternative expression for the ponderomotive force , however .",
    "+ we would now first like to show , on the basis of simple arguments , that it can be understood that the ponderomotive force in a standing wave is polarization - dependent .",

    "the wave is oriented with its nodal planes parallel to the @xmath21-plane , so that the spatial variation of the field is much more rapid in the @xmath22-direction than in the transverse direction .",
    "this is the typical system considered in this paper .",
    "when the particle enters the em field , it will start to quiver in the polarization direction in response to the oscillating electric force @xmath23 .",
    "this electric quiver , combined with the lorentz force equation , leads to the well - known average force , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , independent of the polarization direction .",
    "however , the incident particle will also quiver in response to the magnetic force @xmath24 .",
    "this magnetic quiver can be comparable in magnitude to the electric quiver for relativistic particles . because the magnetic quiver is in the @xmath22-direction , the particle samples a large field gradient , leading to an additional contribution to the ponderomotive force that is comparable to the electric one . and",
    "since the magnetic force and hence the amplitude of the magnetic quiver depend on the angle between @xmath17 and @xmath20 , the magnetic contribution is dependent on the polarization direction .",
    "+ in this paper , the ponderomotive force is derived for a relativistic particle entering a nonrelativistic standing wave with a general three - dimensional field distribution .",
    "it is shown that indeed eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , or the relativistic equivalent , does not hold for this situation .",
    "this may have important implications for experiments and proposals based on the standing wave ponderomotive force .",
    "the main result of this paper , eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) , shows that the modified ponderomotive force is still of simple gradient form , but contains additional polarization - dependent terms .",
    "we identify the polarization - dependent contribution due to the magnetic quiver .",
    "an additional relativistic effect effectively doubles this magnetic contribution .",
    "we thus generalize the results of kaplan and pokrovsky , which follow naturally from our ponderomotive force expression .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec.2 ] , the polarization - dependent ponderomotive gradient force in a standing wave , eq ( [ 22 ] ) ,",
    "is derived using a perturbation expansion method .",
    "the origin of the additional polarization - dependent terms is discussed .",
    "next , eq . ( [ 22 ] ) is applied in section [ sec.3 ] to calculate the averaged equation of motion of an electron in specific standing wave geometries , reproducing the results obtained by kaplan and pokrovsky . in section [ sec.4 ] ,",
    "we validate our ponderomotive force expression by testing it against numerical simulations of electron trajectories in a realistic , non - idealized field configuration .",
    "first consider the idealized case of two plane em waves of equal frequency @xmath7 that counterpropagate along the @xmath22-axis and add to form a standing wave . in the coulomb gauge , the vector potential @xmath25 of this ideal standing wave is then purely harmonic in time @xmath26 and position @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 with @xmath30 the speed of light .",

    "for example , in gaussian laser beams focused to a waist of size @xmath39 , this parameter is @xmath40 .",
    "secondly , the standing wave has a finite lifetime , so that the vector potential is only quasi - monochromatic : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is another small parameter measuring the monochromaticity . for a standing wave produced by counterpropagating laser pulses of temporal length @xmath43 , for example ,",
    "this parameter is @xmath44 .",
    "+ in addition , in this paper the em field is assumed to be of nonrelativistic intensity , which means that @xmath45 for reasons of clarity , for the moment it is assumed that @xmath46 .",
    "however , the derivation below can be generalized straightforwardly to other field strengths such as @xmath47 or @xmath48 , leading to the same result .",
    "appendix [ app.2 ] gives a short description of the generalized derivation .      before considering the dynamics of a charged particle in a standing wave in detail ,",
    "let us first determine what time scales are involved .",
    "first , there is the time scale of the quiver motion , which is the optical time scale @xmath49 .",
    "second , there is the time scale on which the motion of the guiding center changes .",
    "substitution of an ideal standing wave @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and integrating yields oscillatory motion in the @xmath22-direction , with a typical frequency @xmath51 .",
    "thus the guiding center motion in the @xmath22-direction changes on a second , longer time scale @xmath52 .",
    "finally , in a realistic standing wave , the nonzero transverse field gradient causes transverse ponderomotive forces , which in view of eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) are weaker than the longitudinal ponderomotive forces by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the transverse guiding center motion changes on a third , still longer time scale @xmath54 .",
    "+ having established the three time scales of the problem , next consider the equations of motion of a charged particle in the standing wave @xcite : @xmath55 in which @xmath56 is the lorentz factor , and the dyadic notation @xmath57 has been used @xcite .",

    "multiple scale analysis has been applied in a relativistic derivation of the ponderomotive force in propagating em radiation @xcite .",

    "however , we have shown that this is not always true . if the field configuration possesses a direction in which the field changes on the scale of the wavelength , i.e. in a standing wave , and in addition the charged particle is relativistic , the ponderomotive force is modified .",
