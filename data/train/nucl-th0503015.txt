    "we discuss some of the limitations inherent to the two methods used to describe @xmath1 elastic scattering .",
    "the kvp , as presented here , reduces the scattering problem to the solution of a linear set of equations in which the matrix elements of the hamiltonian have to be computed between basis states ; increasing the energy , appreciable contributions from states with high values of @xmath177 appear . in order to take into account these contributions ,",
    "a very large basis has to be used with the consequence that numerical instabilities start to appear . in the integral equation approach at very low energies convergence in terms of screening radius",
    "requires @xmath188 , which in turn increases the number of two - body partial waves that are needed for convergence .",
    "the interplay of these two requirements makes the integral equation solution unstable at those very low energies .",
    "an interesting heuristic argument to understand the size of the screening radius needed for convergence is the wave length @xmath37 corresponding to the on - shell momentum . at 3 mev , 10 mev , and 65 mev proton lab energy , for which a screening radius of 20 fm , 10 fm , and 7 fm is needed for convergence , @xmath37 is @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "it appears that for the calculation of @xmath1 elastic scattering observables the screening has to be only so large that one wave length can be accommodated in the coulomb tail outside the range of the hadronic interaction ; seeing proper coulomb over one wave length appears enough to provide , with the additional help of renormalization , the true coulomb characteristics of scattering despite screening .",
    "in the present paper two methods devised to describe elastic @xmath1 scattering are compared for a wide range of energies .",
    "one of the methods , the kvp , was developed a few years ago and used to study how realistic potential models , including two - body and three - body forces , describe the elastic observables measured for that reaction .",
    "on the other hand , numerical accurate results have been recently obtained solving the ags equation for @xmath1 scattering using a screened coulomb potential corrected for the unscreened limit using a renormalization prescription . as has been briefly described in the present paper ,",
    "both methods are substantially different .",
    "it is satisfactory to observe that both methods produce essentially the same results for a large variety of elastic observables using a realistic two - nucleon potential .",
    "we stress the fact that the selection of observables here presented is only part of the observables compared . in all cases , similar patterns have been obtained .",
    "in addition , by comparing the @xmath1 calculations to the corresponding @xmath100 calculations , coulomb effects have been estimated . as expected these effects are sizable at low energies but at the highest analyzed energy , @xmath175 mev , they are small , except at forward scattering angles . from these considerations",
    "it is possible to identify on a firm basis which @xmath1 observables may or may not be analyzed by calculations in which the coulomb interaction has been neglected",
    ".    we can conclude that at present it is possible to describe @xmath1 elastic scattering , including the coulomb repulsion , using standard techniques as the faddeev equations in configuration and momentum space or variational principles .",

    "<S> the momentum - space calculations proceed via the solution of the alt - grassberger - sandhas equation using the screened coulomb potential and the renormalization approach . </S>",
    "<S> both methods agree within 1% on all observables , showing the reliability of both numerical techniques in that energy domain . at energies below three - body breakup threshold </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate - space method remains favored whereas at energies higher than 65 mev the momentum - space approach seems to be more efficient . </S>"
