    "i know it s hard to believe and i certainly would never have believed it myself when the field started back in the 80 s , but there can be what could be called a `` practical '' aspect to research on direct of dark matter .",
    "this is because with a very small left behind in a dark matter interaction , we must develop very sensitive s. in particular there has been an intensive development of cryogenic s which in virtue of their operation at very low temperature show a strong repsonse to very small @xcite .",
    "this can have unexpected consequences .",
    "i d like to present two we have been involved with , one related to materials science and one in biology .",
    "the first begins with the early runs of the cresst cryogenic dark matter detector in gran sasso in 1999 @xcite .",
    "much careful effort went into the design and construction of a low background setup , aimed at achieving only a few events per day .",
    "when it finally ran in gran sasso we found to our horror rates in the 1000 s per hour instead",
    ".    there followed several months of feverish search with all kinds of hypotheses , some plausible and others less so ...",
    "electronics? ... suspensions ? ... somebody touch the crystal with bare hands ? ... correlation with traffic in the gran sasso tunnel ?",
    "...    the worst nightmare would of course have been a radioactive contamination .",
    "but on this there was one thing that saved us from complete desperation .",
    "even if there is a fearsome radioactive background you do nt know anything about , there is one thing you _ do _ know : it must be poisson distributed in time . however , the mysterious events were not poissonian .",
    "they seemed to rather come in ` bursts ' , and this was confirmed by statistical anaylsis .",
    "so it was nt a radioactive contamination .",
    "but what the devil was it ?",
    "[ engy ]     fig.[fig : photo ] shows the culprit . the s were sapphire ( @xmath0 ) crystals held tightly in place by small ( @xmath1 mm ) sapphire balls .",
    "one sees some kind of fracture at the point of contact `` cracks '' we called them .",
    "apparently the `` tight holding '' which is used in cryogenic work to avoid problems with `` microphonics '' was _ too _ tight ; enough to crack the very hard material sapphire .",
    "as soon as the sapphire balls were replaced by plastic stubs , which are evidently somewhat softer , the rate went down to to the expected level .",
    "we all breathed a sigh of relief and that seemed the end of the story .",
    "[ h ]   ( solid line ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "several years later , however , the realization sudenly hit that we must have the worlds greatest data sample on ` cracks ' .",
    "since the rate went down from thousands per hour to a few per day , the pulses detected in that period must have been essentially all `` cracks '' . and these were taken with good energy and time resolution , under low background conditions and with many , many , thousands of events .",
    "this splendid collection of well observed `` cracks '' ought to be of interest to somebody .",
    "indeed , several years later , in finland , we found people knowledgeable about the subject and we began to look at the data @xcite .",
    "the first thing we did was to plot the spectrum .",
    "this is shown in fig.[spec ] .",
    "`` looks just like earthquakes''was the first observation . indeed the spectra seem to follow a power law , @xmath2 as do the magnitudes ( richter scale ) of earthquakes .",
    "interpretation here is simpler than in seismology . in seismology",
    "it is non - trivial to find the spectrum for quakes since working back from the richter scale ( a kind of amplitude ) to the whole of the event involves various assumptions and calculations .",
    "but the cryois a type of calorimeter , one is just measuring the total directly .",
    "( on the other hand , it must be said that earthquake data has a much larger range , covering five or six orders of magnitude compared to the one or two here . )",
    "but if we follow the standard lore of how to translate the richter scale to an scale , we get a power @xmath3 for earthquakes . over different cresst data",
    "sets the power was @xmath4 1.7 2.0 , suggestively close to the earthquake number .",
    "i m not aware of any simple , basic , explanation for this power , nor for any of other ones we found in the analysis .    with this wealth of data various other interesting statistical aspects of the data can be studied .",
    "one is the `` waiting time '' , a statistic suitable for intermittent phenomena and often used in this kind of work . to every event we associate the time until the next event , and then plot the distribution of these `` waiting '' times .     and to ( upper )",
    "@xmath5 with @xmath6 . ]    for an ideal poissonian source the waiting time distribution should be @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average waiting time or the inverse of the event rate .",
    "fortunately we had such data available , since cresst s are periodically calibrated with an external @xmath9 source  necessarily poissonian .",
    "this is shown in fig[wt ] by the lower curve , and it has indeed the expected poissonian form . on the other hand ,",
    "the same plot for the cracks ( upper curve ) is well above a poissonian at small waiting times , and in fact is well fit by a poissonian times a power law , namely @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "interestingly enough , an analysis of earthquake waiting times came up with the same fit with the same power @xcite .",
    "our power is not very well determined and this could be a coincidence , but it certainly is intriguing .",
    "another point concerns not earthquakes but material studies .",
    "as can be seen from fig[engy ] the threshold in this data was in the kev s .",
    "this corresponds to breaking only some hundreds of bonds in sapphire .",
    "it turns out this is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than previous work in the subject , where it s more like @xmath12 bonds @xcite .",
    "possibly , with a dedeicated setup , one could get down to the single bond level .",
    "this would be an exciting possibility and we have some thoughts about what such an apparatus might look like @xcite .",
    "briefly , we can advertise the following points from this study and for the cryo :    @xmath13 a new technology for studying microfracture . with unparalled sensitivity . perhaps to the few atom level with a dedicated setup .",
    "@xmath13 the method provides a direct , absolute measurement of the _ total _ energy , as opposed to previous work either in seismology or materials study .",
    "@xmath13 there are striking similarities with earthquakes . despite the stupdenous difference in scale , and big material differences ,",
    "there appear to be close and even quantitative similarities .",
    "something universal must be at work .",
    "this is a challenge to theory .",
    "is there , for example , a relation between the exponents @xmath14 and @xmath15 ?",
    "my second story begins even earlier , in 1991 .",
    "it rests upon a very deep physical insight , namely :    @xmath16    the history of this profound observation is the following .",
    "mass spectroscopy with macromolecules is a valuable and frequently used tool in molecular biology . in such fields as genomics and proteomics",
    "time - of - flight studies are performed with very big molecules and their fragments .",
    "the biologist will have a , say , 20 kev accelerator in the basement . as opposed to the particle or nuclear physicist who at most will deal with heavy nuclei , the biologists",
    "is concerned with macromolecules in the many kd range .",
    "( one d= dalton= 1 h atom . ) with such enormous masses , and given that @xmath17 , a chunk with 20 kev will not be moving very fast at all .        now in practically all familiar detectors , geiger counters , scintillation counters , .. the initiating event is the ejection of an electron , leading to ionization , scintillation ... but as we learn in elementary atomic physics , the cross section for hitting an electron depends on _ velocity _ and is maximum when @xmath18 . thus with big , slow , molecules , as we get into the hundreds of kd or more , becomes more and more difficult and inefficient .",
    "mulling upon this problem now and then , one day i suddenly came upon the deep insight eq[ins ] .",
    "the cryodetector , being a kind of calorimeter , does nt care if the molecule is slow .",
    "it works on heat , _ energy _ , not velocity . for a cryodetector",
    "a huge , slow , 20 kev protein is the same thing as a 20 kev electron ! ?",
    "... theoretically . as many of our senior",
    ", seasoned participants at the conference will know , most good , simple - sounding ideas have a catch .",
    "could this really work ?",
    "but after discussion with my brother marv , who is a microbiologist and who found the idea interesting , it was actually tried out by damien twerenbold and collaborators @xcite .",
    "it actually worked !",
    "this in turn has lead to the production of commercial devices .",
    "a result with one of these is shown in fig[hllp ] , where the results with a cryoare compared with that for a conventional in looking for rare proteins associated with the liver disease hellp @xcite .",
    "a couple of nice peaks ( masses in boldface ) , lost in the noise with the conventional , show up nicely with the cryo .",
    "our group at the mpi , has furthermore developed improved s optimized for good timing for improved time - of - flight accuracy .",
    "this also naturally leads to background reduction and tests showed very high sensitivty , reaching attomoles @xcite .",
    "for the application of the cryoin mass spectrometry we can thus note    @xmath13 it _ really _ appears to be true that `` @xmath19 '' for the cryodetector    @xmath13 in principle the technique has no mass limitation ( one of our students once tried to launch a whole virus  results unclear )    @xmath13 the technique has a very high sensitivy , useful in rare protein studies and diagnostics    @xmath13 good timing can give high mass resolution ; one could possibly see the modification of a single base",
    "these two examples of and mass spectrometry are not the last we ll see from this still relatively young technology and many are being actively discussed and tried out @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to see what s still coming ."
