    "<S> in this letter , we report on the observation of a recently predicted novel type of feshbach resonance @xcite , enabling the tuning of interorbital interactions based on the zeeman shift of different nuclear spin states of the atoms .    in a feshbach resonance , a bound state of the energetically inaccessible molecular potential ( closed channel ) couples to the scattering continuum of the energetically allowed entrance channel . </S>",

    "<S> the presence of a magnetic field will therefore mix the singlet and triplet states , introducing a coupling between the orbital and spin degrees of freedom . in this case , the non - interacting system has the eigenbasis @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    two atoms entering the potential in the open channel eigenstate @xmath22 couple to @xmath23 through the orbital - mixing interaction term . at short distances </S>",

    "<S> the excitation process has an efficiency of approximately 90% and the thermalization rate in the zero - crossing regime of @xmath36 is therefore bounded from below by the thermalization of the @xmath60 atoms with the residual @xmath61 atoms .    </S>",

    "<S> below 50 g , we observe a significant repopulation of the @xmath67 state , since orbital exchange becomes energetically favorable at low fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> accounting for this exchange , the loss feature still remains strongly shifted towards lower magnetic fields compared to the resonance position in the elastic channel ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : losses]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in fact similar to observations in other mixtures of fermions @xcite , but the shift is possibly enhanced due to the intrinsically large size of the shallow bound state .    at the resonance position , we extract a lifetime of @xmath74ms at a temperature @xmath75 and an initial peak density of @xmath76 atoms/@xmath77 . assuming three - body decay for the @xmath78@xmath65 mixture , we obtain a loss rate coefficient of . the observed loss is comparable to previously reported values in alkali fermi gases , e.g. , @xmath79k mixtures @xcite . </S>",
