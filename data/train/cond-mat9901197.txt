    "<S> the analytical expression of the eddy diffusivity tensor is found for a @xmath1d steady shear flow and it is an increasing function of the characteristic noise decorrelation time @xmath2 . in order to study a generic flow @xmath3 , a small-@xmath2 expansion is performed and the first correction @xmath4 to the effective diffusion coefficients is evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> this is done using two different approaches and it results that at the order @xmath2 the problem with a colored noise is equivalent to the white - in - time case provided by a renormalization of the velocity field @xmath5 depending on @xmath2 . </S>",
