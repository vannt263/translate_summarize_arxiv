    "phase transition is a fundamental change in the character of the state of a system when one of its parameters passes through the critical point .",
    "states on the opposite sides of the critical point are characterized by different types of ordering . in a second order phase transition ,",
    "the fundamental change is continuous and the critical point is characterized by divergences in the coherence ( or healing ) length and in the relaxation time .",
    "this critical slowing down implies that no matter how slowly a system is driven through the transition its evolution can not be adiabatic close to the critical point . if it were adiabatic , then the system would continuously evolve between the two types of ordering .",
    "however , in the wake of the necessarily non - adiabatic ( and approximately impulse ) evolution in the critical region , ordering of the state after the transition is not perfect : it is a mosaic of ordered domains whose finite size depends on the rate of the transition .",
    "this scenario was first described in the cosmological setting by kibble @xcite who appealed to relativistic casuality to set the size of the domains .",
    "the dynamical mechanism relevant for second order phase transitions was proposed by one of us @xcite .",
    "it is based on the universality of critical slowing down , and leads to prediction that the size of the ordered domains scales with the transition time @xmath0 as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a combination of critical exponents . the  kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) for second order thermodynamic phase transitions",
    "was confirmed by numerical simulations of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau model @xcite and successfully tested by experiments in liquid crystals @xcite , superfluid helium 3 @xcite , both high-@xmath11 @xcite and low-@xmath11 @xcite superconductors and even in non - equilibrium systems @xcite . with the exception of superfluid @xmath12he  where the early detection of copious defect formation @xcite was subsequently attributed to vorticity inadvertently introduced by stirring @xcite , and",
    "the situation remains unclear ",
    "experimental results are consistent with kzm , although more experimental work is clearly needed to allow for more stringent experimental tests of kzm .",
    "the kibble - zurek mechanism is thus a universal theory of the dynamics of second order phase transitions whose applications range from the low temperature bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite to the ultra high temperature transitions in the grand unified theories of high energy physics . however , the zero temperature quantum limit remained unexplored until very recently , see refs.@xcite and an example of disordered system in ref .",
    "@xcite , and quantum phase transitions are in many respects qualitatively different from transitions at finite temperature .",
    "most importantly time evolution is unitary , so there is no damping , and there are no thermal fluctuations that initiate symmetry breaking in kzm .",
    "quantum state of the many body system is indeed profoundly different from a classical state : instead of a single broken symmetry configuration it may ( and , generally , will ) contain _ all _ of the possible configurations in a superposition .",
    "in addition to the ` classical ' way of characterizing this state through the density of excitations ( e.g. defects ) , one can wonder how entangled various parts of the system are with each other .",
    "von neumann entropy of a fragment due to its entanglement with the rest of the system is a convenient way to quantify this .",
    "it can be computed as a function of the size of the fragment . in equilibrium , and away from the critical point , this entropy of entanglement saturates at distances of the order of the coherence length @xmath13 of the system at values @xmath14 for one dimensional systems @xcite . however , at the critical point ( where equilibrium coherence length @xmath13 becomes infinite ) entropy of entanglement diverges with the size of the fragment . in particular , in one dimensional systems , the critical entanglement entropy diverges logarithmically ( @xmath15 ) with the length @xmath3 of the chain fragment @xcite .",
    "this equilibrium behavior suggests the question : what is the entanglement entropy left behind by an out - of - equilibrium phase transition ?",
    "such a transition will pass through the critical point ( where entanglement entropy is logarithmically divergent ) but this will happen at a finite rate set by the quench time @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the resulting entanglement entropy is of the order of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the healing ( coherence ) length at the instant when critical slowing down forces the system to switch from the approximately adiabatic to approximately impulse ( ` diabatic ' ) behavior .",
    "this suggests that the same process that determines the size of regions that `` break symmetry in unison '' ( which sets the density of topological defects left by the transition ) is also responsible for the resulting entanglement of formation left by the quench .",
    "this finding is consistent with recent results on quantum phase transitions induced by instantaneous quenches @xcite which indicate that structures present in the initial pre - transition state determine the structures ( and hence entanglement of formation ) that arise after an instantaneous quench : our results also suggest that  in accord with kzm  it is a good approximation to consider quench to be approximately adiabatic until the instant @xmath18 before the critical point is reached , and approximately impulse ( e.g. nearly instantaneous ) inside this time interval .",
    "this also confirms and extends results of the recent study of cherng and levitov @xcite who computed entropy density and correlations induced by quenches in one - dimensional chains , and concluded that their results support kzm .",
    "while our results below are established for the one - dimensional quantum ising model ( which has the considerable advantage of being exactly solvable ) , we conjecture that similar behavior will be encountered in other quantum phase transitions , and that their non - equilibrium evolution can be anticipated using equilibrium critical exponents using kzm",
    ". this conjecture can be then tested in a variety of systems that undergo quantum phase transitions both in condensed matter and in atomic physics experiments .",
    "according to sachdev @xcite , the understanding of quantum phase transitions is based on two prototypical models .",
    "one is the quantum rotor model and the other is the one - dimensional quantum ising model .",
    "of the two only the ising model is exactly solvable .",

    "any superposition of these two states is also a ` legal ' ground state providing it is consistent with other quantum numbers ( e.g. parity ) conserved by the transition from the initial paramagnetic state .",

    "this process makes short range ferromagnetic correlation function oscillatory rather than purely exponential , which means that on length scales shorter than @xmath8 the random -kink - antikink - kink - antikink- train looks more like a regular crystal lattice . at the same time , thanks to phase ordering , a longer block of spins is necessary to saturate the entropy of entanglement .",
    "it is important to note that the first process depends on the universal characteristics of ( quantum or classical ) second order phase transitions and can be modeled by kzm .",
    "therefore , we expect that conclusions we have reached for the specific case of the quantum ising model are generally applicable : once the universality class of the transition is characterized by means of the relevant critical exponents , predictions of e.g. the entanglement entropy left in the wake of the phase transition can be made . by contrast",
