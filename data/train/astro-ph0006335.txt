    "we here discuss one case which we have followed up with the more sensitive narrow - field instruments ( nfi ) on board _ bepposax _ and with the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 2.1  m optical telescope , and whose signature we searched for in data from the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) and in occultation data from the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory . in all observations we have interesting detections .",

    "the wfcs ( jager et al . 1997 ) on the _ bepposax _ satellite ( boella et al .",
    "1997a ) carry out a monitoring program where they point at arbitrary positions in the sky .",
    "this program is the secondary mode program whereby the wfc pointings are dictated by those of the narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on the same satellite and the constraints of the satellite attitude with respect to the direction of the sun .",
    "the secondary mode observations entail roughly 90% of all observations .",
    "there are two identical wfcs .",
    "they each have @xmath5  square degrees field of views ( full width to zero response ) with @xmath6  angular resolution .",
    "the bandpass is 2 to 26 kev .",
    "the wfcs have been active continuously since mid-1996 , except for a 1-month period in may 1998 when unit 1 was turned off , and a 3 week period in early 1999 when both cameras were turned off . during",
    "mid - may to mid - august 1997 , the satellite was in a standby mode , with both cameras turned on but without sufficient stabilization for sensitive imaging .    during 103.4  d on - source time with a net exposure time of 27.8  d , the secondary observations covered the field around the supernova remnant cas  a. this exposure is roughly uniformly distributed in time .",

    "a , there are no bright x - ray sources present in this field .",
    "compared to the background levels in the wfcs , cas  a is not so bright .",
    "the sensitivity is , therefore , close to optimum in the field . during two instances , a relatively faint transient turned up in the field , at an angular distance of 6.0  from cas  a. they were on march 4 , 1997 , and may 8 , 1999 .",
    "we note that sometimes cyg  x-2 is in the same field of view as this transient , but at an angular distance of 24.5  which implies it does not degrade the signal of the transient .",
    "the celestial position of the wfc - detected transient is @xmath739@xmath822.8@xmath9 , @xmath10  =  + 611647with a 99% confidence error radius of 18 .",

    "[ figwfclcop ] , we present a light curve with a resolution of about a day .",
    "the period over which we detected activity is about 1 week .",
    "the variation in brightness during this event seems to suggest that it was not active for much longer .    a light curve of the second wfc - detected outburst is presented in fig .",
    "[ figwfclcop2 ] .",
    "the measured peak flux of this outburst is about a factor of 3 lower than that of the first outburst but this could very well be a sampling effect .",
    "the source was above the detection threshold for one week but due to an unfavorable sampling it could just as well have been active for 50 days .",
    "we have extracted the spectrum from the observation at the peak of the first outburst and modeled it with a simple power law plus absorption due to interstellar gas of cosmic abundances ( according to morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "we kept the value for the hydrogen column density @xmath11 fixed at @xmath12  @xmath13 , as found from hi maps ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",

    "the chance probability of a background point source with a flux in excess of @xmath20  in the wfc error region is 0.3% ( based on the counts by giommi et al .",
    "we reduced the spectrum of the point source from the mecs data through application of the maximum likelihood method ( e.g. , in  t  zand et al . 2000 ) and tried to model it with absorbed single - component models like a power - law function and thermal bremsstrahlung , while fixing @xmath11 to 1@xmath21  @xmath13 .",

    "the asm is fully operational since march 1996 and monitors each position on the sky in 2 to 12 kev during 90  sec snapshots with a frequency of 5 to 10 times a day at a sensitivity of @xmath27  mcrab per day of observervations on uncrowded fields ( levine et al . 1996 ) .",

    "the single occultation step data were then fit with a power law with a -2.0 photon index to determine daily flux measurements in the 20 - 100 kev band . a time period of 30 days centered on each outburst was examined for emission .",
    "various time averages of the data were performed to search for a possible signal in the data .    during the time of the march 1997 outburst we find evidence of a weak two day outburst in the batse data ( see fig .  [ figbatse ] ) .",
    "the 20 - 100 flux for highest daily average corresponds to 0.080 times that of the crab in the same bandpass .",
    "it appears that there is a @xmath303 day delay between the peak in the batse data and that detected in the wfc . for any of the other outbursts predicted throughout the batse operational period we do not find evidence for hard x - ray emission , but we can not rule out the presence of a source with a flux 0.050 times that of the crab or less being present in the data .",

    "we looked for the optical counterpart of sax  j2239.3 + 6116 by obtaining spectra of the three brightest stars in the nfi error circle on 1999 dec . 2 and 3 ut , using the kpno 2.1  m telescope and goldcam spectrograph .",

    "since these are somewhat redder than the colors of an early b star , we suspect that there may be some additional circumstellar extinction , and that dereddened @xmath58 is a realistic estimate .",

    "4u  2238 + 60 was detected at a level of @xmath61  ( 2 - 10 kev , statistical error only ) which is about 4 times lower than the peak of the march 1997 outburst .",
    "this is not really surprising because neither measurement encompassed the whole outburst .",
    "ariel _ source ( warwick et al . 1981 ) is classified as an irregular variable source during the 1974 - 1980 operational period with a measured peak flux of @xmath62  ( 2 - 10 kev ) which is also of the same order of magnitude as  and 4u  2238 + 60 .",
    "there are two other interesting sources which have error boxes that are close to that of  but are formally inconsistent .",
    "the first one is the fast transient at  2238 + 584 which was seen in july 1975 with the sky - survey instrument on _ ariel v _",
    "( pye & mchardy 1983 ) .",
    "the outburst was not covered completely .",

    "we mention this because  is the bright x - ray source closest to  and because  has quite a hard spectrum in the x - ray range .",

    "in such a be x - ray binary system , the transient nature of the x - rays is thought to arise from a combination of episodic mass loss by the be star , and an eccentric binary orbit . the compact object orbiting the",

    "kev flux history shows fluctuations of a factor of 10@xmath2 .",

    "it seems plausible that  was more or less active over the last decades .",
    "the peak flux is so low that it can easily be missed .",
    "the spectral type of the counterpart , the resulting luminosity and the transient behavior is consistent with the identification of  as a be x - ray binary .",
    "this is also confirmed by the value for the x - ray to optical color index @xmath66 ( as defined by van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) where @xmath67 is the dereddened @xmath67 magnitude and @xmath68 the 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux . for @xmath69 and @xmath70jy ( during quiescence ) @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath67 would be 9.7 ( to correct for additional circumstellar extinction ) then @xmath72 . these are perfectly normal values for be x - ray binaries in quiescence and three times lower than for low - mass x - ray binaries .",

    "this may be explained by the fact that the pulse period is longer than 10@xmath2  sec .",
    "corbet ( 1984 ) discovered a strong correlation between orbital and pulse period for be x - ray binaries .",
    "if adheres to this correlation , the orbital period of 262  d implies a pulse period near to 10@xmath2  sec .",
