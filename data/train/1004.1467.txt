    "experimental confirmation was the triumph of einstein s general theory of relativity [ 1 - 3 ] . in the present paper , the authors , however , first cast doubts on both - the newtonian explanation and einstein s explanation in two subsequent paragraphs ; and then propose an alternative explanation based on refraction - phenomenon of optics .",
    "the alternative theory in this paper also explains black - hole and gravitational red / blue - shift .",
    "+   + conventional newtonian explanation for bending of light is based on photon s gravitational attraction towards the star ( sun ) .",
    "in fact , photon has no material mass ( rest - mass zero ) and has mass @xmath2 only due to its energy @xmath3 .",
    "it is hypothesized that gravitation is only between material bodies ; the authors cast doubts on the newtonian gravitational - attraction on photon .",
    "though photon has energy & momentum @xcite ; it does not seem to have inertial & gravitational mass , else it would have been possible to accelerate or decelerate it .",
    "moreover , if photon is considered as wave , it is not clear as how ( & if ) gravity can influence it .",
    "the authors thus conclude / opine that gravitation ( of sun ) does not influence photon ( coming from venus ) , therefore can not cause bending of light through newtonian - mechanics .",
    "also thus gravitation should not be responsible for the so - called gravitational - red / blue - shift .",
    "+   + einstein s general - relativity explanation is based on geodesic or curvature of space - time near a massive body .",
    "although general - relativity has passed several tests , but it has a serious weak point . according to einstein , gravity is ` not a real force ' , but an artifact of curvature .",
    "the present authors wish to mention that if ptolemy geo - centric model can ultimately change after thirteen centuries , newton s model can be modified after three centuries , einstein s general - relativity theory too can also be altered in one century . for the sake of truth to prevail ,",
    "all avenues for possible truth must be kept open .",
    "+   + the authors propose alternative explanation based on refraction - phenomenon of optics , for bending of light near star .",
    "when venus - light from space ( say , vacuum or near - vacuum ) enters into the star s surroundings / atmosphere ( comparatively denser medium ) the light - ray bends towards the star ( sun ) due to common well known phenomenon of refraction of light .",
    "the refraction - based theory is also able to explain gravitational red / blue shift .",
    "also , black - hole , gravitational - lensing and space - time too are considered in the new perspective . in view of the uncertainty & unavailability of information / data regarding refractive - index of atmospheric - medium and its variations ; a rather semi - empirical approach , for the alternative explanation for bending of light near a star and gravitational red / blue shift etc .",
    ", is appropriate and is described in the paper as follows .",
    "only some scanty & scattered informations are available in literature & on internet , such as a few recent ones quoted [ 5 - 13 ] here , on refraction - based theories ( or alternative theories ) for bending of light near a star . however , unfortunately , the alternative attempts seem to have been met with less - appreciation and more - ridicules .",
    "many people were even hesitant to propose such alternative theories against well - established general - relativity - based gravitational - bending , in fear of being criticized & ridiculed .",
    "nevertheless , some [ 9 - 13 ] have dared to go a step further and even questioned the established notions of physics , and that some [ 11 - 13 ] have suggested that most of the ` general - relativity test ' could be explained even without ` general - relativity ' .",
    "+   + many alternative theories of gravitation have been proposed in literature , can also be found on net , not discussed herein , but it is to mention that mostly these are ` metric - based ' & variant of general - relativity .",
    "a novel theory of gravitation , as an alternative to einstein s general - theory - of - gravitation , proposed by gupta @xcite is interestingly relies on einstein s special - theory - of - relativity ; einstein s ( general - relativity theory ) view and the author s ( alternative gravity theory ) view on ` curvature ' of space - time are discussed in sections- 7 & 8 of this paper , both the views appear to be different but the essence & effect are more - or - less the same .",
    "truly , some [ 12,13 ] agree that : it can be argued that bending due to light - refraction and general - relativity based gravitational - bending have more in common ( as explained in the section-8 ) than is generally realized .",
    "refraction of light rays is a well known optics - phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this provides an alternative explanation of bending of light near a star . when light ray , from space ( near vacuum ) , enters the star s atmosphere ( medium ) ; the light ray bends near the star due to refraction . to illustrate the bending due to refraction , consider a spherical water - droplet as shown in figure(1.a ) .",
    "when light ray enters from lighter medium ( air ) to denser medium ( water ) , the droplet works as prism and thus the light - ray bends due to refraction .",
    "similarly , when light ray enters from space - vacuum ( lighter medium ) to star s atmosphere ( denser medium ) it bends due to refraction as shown in figure(1.b ) .",
    "the atmosphere extends to great heights , it becomes rarer and rarer , however ; a reasonable equivalent height is shown in the figure .",
    "+   + the amount of bending ( maximum deviation ) can be estimated semi - empirically @xmath4 as shown in section 3.3 ) as follows .",
    "consider the limiting case when the light ray enters the atmosphere touching at point a and leaves touching at point c. the incident ray touches at @xmath5 & refraction angle is r at point a and vice - versa at point c as shown in figure(2 ) .",
    "the angle r is thus critical angle @xmath6 , and for maximum deviation the line ac touches the star - core at point b. from the star - geometry of figure(2 ) , @xmath7 where @xmath8 & r are atmospheric - radius and core - radius of the star .",
    "thus @xmath9 where h is the equivalent - height of atmosphere above the star - core ( estimated in the following section 3.2 ) . for max deviation situation ( figure(2 ) ) thus ,            @xmath10      star - core is enveloped by dense & diluted gaseous surroundings ( or atmosphere ) with varying density & refractive - index .",

    "but the main factors for star ( sun ) seems to be gravitation and radiation - pressure .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath12 could probably depend ( proportional ) on another dimensionless quantity @xmath13 ( mentioned earlier for bending of light near the star ) .",

    "the new approach is based on the commonly well - known phenomenon of refraction of light ; there is , however , a fuzz - factor k to account for uncertainty such as in estimation of star s atmospheric height & its refractive index .",
    "the authors aim to emphasize that though refraction - phenomenon approach and general - relativity approach are in agreement as far as result is concerned but the physics of both the approaches are quite different .      in perspective of refraction phenomenon discussed for bending of light , the so called gravitational - lensing @xcite is in fact ` real ' refraction - lensing of light due to refraction through atmospheric - layer of star or galaxy ( note - both star & galaxy are surrounded with cloud of gases / materials , both can cause refraction - bending of light and thus lensing ) .",
    "in fact the word ` lensing ' here literally means real lensing ( bending of light due to refraction ) . but through optical - lens deviation occurs with some dispersion too , causing chromatic aberration .",
    "it is expected that here too , if the lensing is due to refraction ( as said in the present paper ) , a little dispersion ( chromatic aberration ) can also occur which may possibly be found experimentally .",

    "the ` minimum ' possible n for a polygon to exist is 3 ( triangle ) ; so for n =3 , r = 30 degrees .",
    "the limiting case for n = 3 , @xmath41 ( as shown in figure(3.c ) ) may be looked at as if this limiting case correspond to black - hole formation .",
    "this is because if the critical angle @xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , the light ray will directly fall ( be trapped ) onto the star - core and will be absorbed , thus the ray will not come - out .",

    "previous ( newtonian / einstein s ) theories consider velocity of light c constant , @xmath58 increases ( due to gravitational - energy / time - dilation ) thus blue - shift , @xmath59 decreases to keep c constant .",
    "whereas , present refraction - based theory considers that energy hence @xmath58 remains constant , c decreases ( from @xmath61 to @xmath62 ) , @xmath59 decreases ( from @xmath71 to @xmath72 ) thus blue - shift . for both ( present & previous ) theories @xmath59 decreases for blue - shift ; but in previous theories @xmath58 increases & c remains constant whereas in present theory @xmath58 remains constant and c decreases as the ray enters into atmosphere .",

    "however , looking for a similar formula and noting that velocity of sound @xmath75 is related to pressure & density ; the equivalent atmospheric - height for  planet / satellite is empirically suggested/ modified roughly as @xmath76 which gives reasonably possible values ( order of magnitude wise ) @xmath77 for earth and @xmath78 for moon ; but as we know , @xmath79 for moon for different reason ( escape velocity ) .",
    "+   + ( 2 ) as a daring step the authors opine that gravitational - attraction is between material bodies only .",
    "thus gravity does not influence / attract rest - mass - less photon , or photon ( electro - magnetic wave ) is unaffected by gravity . since matter - less photon does nt has grain - mass @xcite , it will not have any gravitational or inertial mass either .",
    "+   + ( 3 ) bending of light(photon)-path is neither due to newtonian ` gravitational - attraction ' nor due to einstein s ` geodesic ' , but due to refraction - phenomenon of optics within the atmosphere .",
    "+   + ( 4 ) there should be no - refraction and thus no - bending of light around a planet or satellite with almost no - atmosphere ( such as on moon ) .",
    "+   + ( 5 ) black - hole has a thick skirt of atmosphere @xmath80 of high refractive index @xmath81 .",
    "black - hole physics is - first trapping of light ( due to total - internal - reflection ) within atmosphere and finally absorbed within the black - hole core which can re - radiate it out in due course .",
    "+   + ( 6 ) gravitational - lensing being the true refraction - lensing ; should show some chromatic effect / aberration , which may however be too less to be noticed normally .",
    "+   + ( 7 ) the red - shift for example , occurs only when the ray comes out of atmosphere and no further red - shift afterwards .",
    "frequency @xmath58 remains same , wavelength @xmath59 and velocity of light c changes .",

    "if the potentials of this new approach is recognized / appreciated , it would possibility have important bearings on understanding of cosmology .",
    "in fact due to gravity , density thus refractive - index of the atmosphere varies in radial direction ; thus during bending , the light ray actually follows a curved path due to variation of @xmath11 within the medium .",
    "this curved path ( as shown by a thin free - hand drawn curved - line in figure(1.b ) ) is apparently considered as einstein s ` geodesic ' of general - relativity whereas in fact it is ` geodesic ' due to refraction through the medium of varying @xmath11 .",

    "forward it follows a curved path in the 3-d ` space'- atmosphere creating an impression of ` geodesic ' in 4-d space - time .",
    "+   + briefly summarized - ( 1 ) einstein s view and ( 2 ) authors view on space - time and gravity are as follows : +   + ( 1 ) as per einstein s general - relativity the very ` vacuum ' of 4-d space - time is warped / curved around a mass ; also that there is no gravity but apparently appears due to curvature of the space - time . `",
    "space - time curvature ( warping ) causes apparent - gravity ' .",
    "+   + ( 2 ) as per authors view the gaseous-`atmosphere ' in flat 4-d space - time is warped / curved around the mass ; and that gravity is very much there and the warping / curving ( variation ) of atmospheric properties is due to gravity . `",
    "gravity causes variation ( warping / curving ) of space - time ' . the space - time",
    "` fabric ' which warps ( curves ) around the mass is not ` vacuum ' but the ` atmosphere ' @xcite .",
    "warping of the fabric of space - time , is in fact , is the variation of properties ( density and refractive - index ) within the surrounding - atmosphere around the massive body .",
    "a million - dollar question , like egg & chicken problem , can be asked that whether ( i ) it is the space - time curvature around big - mass that causes apparent gravity - effect or ( ii ) it is the real gravity - force that causes atmospheric density variation ( viz . curvature ) around the big - mass . as explained by gupta @xcite it is concluded that : as per einstein s general - relativity [ 1 - 3 ] it is the first answer ( curvature causes gravity - effect ) , whereas as per gupta s gravity - theory @xcite it is the second answer ( gravity causes curvature - effect ) .",
    "in fact @xcite gravity force is real and not the artifact of curvature , rather curvature ( density - variation ) can be said as an effect of gravity .",
    "origin of gravity is not the curvature , but it is the gravity which is the origin of the so - called curvature .",
    "einstein s space - time curvature of empty - space is equivalent to density ( or refractive - index ) variation of the atmosphere in matter - universe ; that in a way implies equivalence @xcite of bending of light near a star ( i ) due to curvature of warped empty - space implying general - relativity based gravitational - bending or ( ii ) due to variation of density ( refractive - index ) causing refraction which makes the light - ray to bend & follow a curved path ( as shown by the thin curved - line within the atmospheric - region in figure(1.b ) ) .",
    "the two differently appearing explanations seem to have something in common , probably these two are almost ( more - or - less ) the same thing appearing different as being viewed from different perspectives .",
    "early sun - rise and late sun - set than the actual - happenings ( by about 3 minutes ) are the well known & established facts @xcite , which are known to occur due to refraction - based bending of light in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "but general - relativity based gravitational - bending of star - light near sun is considered to be different , based on phenomenon of space - time curvature . though the proposed refraction - based theory in the present - paper seems to has more in - common than generally realized , but the ` physics ' is different .",
    "some possible litmus - tests are proposed , as follows , to test / verify the herein proposed refraction - based theory for terrestrial & cosmological phenomena .",
    "not much details , however , for the experimental schemes for the proposed tests have been provided ; but the ideas & the salient features behind the tests have been clearly indicated .",
    "+   + ( 1 ) general - relativity based gravitational - bending of light is frequency - independent whereas the refraction - based bending is quite obviously frequency - dependent .",
    "for example : it is well known that in the vibgyor - spectrum , the higher - frequency blue - light bends more than the lower - frequency red - light .",
    "the frequency- dependant bending of light near a star , though may be small , if really found in terrestrial / cosmological observations , will establish the truth of refraction - based theory . also , it is expected that there would be more bending of the high - frequency x - ray than the low - frequency radio - signals existing within the wide - spectrum of the star - light . +   + ( 2 ) if the gravitational - lensing is a result of refraction - based theory which is frequency - dependent , the sky therefore should be more colorful in view of chromatic - aberration in the images , which may possibly be noticed / observed .",
    "+   + ( 3 ) as explained in the section-5 of this paper , it is explained that the red / blue shift is in fact due to the fact that light - speed in denser - medium is less than that in rarer - medium .",
    "it is well known that the frequency of the incident light remains the same during refraction , hence any blue / red shift is in - fact due to corresponding change of wavelength @xmath82 . with some specially designed experiment , it could possibly be found that , say , blue - shift is ` not due to real - increase in frequency but due to real - decrease of wavelength ' of light in the medium wherein light - speed is lesser .",
    "+   + ( 4 ) if we fabricate a sphere of radius @xmath83 in such a way , that it has a dark - black light - absorbing inner - core of radius r surrounded by a glass - like material of @xmath45 of thickness r all around ; the whole sphere would appear black ( light would be entrapped in it , as explained in section-4 ) .",
    "this would make a sort of black - hole type object which could be held in hand ( of course without any danger ! ) .",
    "diamond has @xmath43 , but it seems costly & impracticable to use diamond for it .",
    "is there any other such glass - like material @xmath84 which could be affordable & practicable to be used to construct such toy type mini black - hole ?",
    "it is suggested that - gravitation is only between material bodies and that the zero - rest - mass photon is unaffected by gravity . the alternative novel approach to explain phenomena such as bending of light near a star and gravitational red / blue shift",
    "is based on refraction phenomenon of optics .",
    "bending of light is due to bending of ray due to refraction within the star s atmosphere .",
    "the red / blue shift is due to optical - phenomenon of change of wavelength ( frequency remaining same ) due to change in velocity of light in the atmospheric medium .",
    "other aspects such as black - hole and gravitational - lensing are also re - examined in the new perspective of refraction - phenomenon .",
    "interesting predictions are made and also a few tests are suggested .",
    "in fact many of the general - relativity - tests are explained without general - relativity on the basis of refraction - phenomenon .",

    "<S> many of the general - relativity - tests such as bending of light near a star and gravitational red / blue shift are explained without general - relativity & without newtonian - approach . </S>",
    "<S> the authors first cast doubts on both , the newtonian and the relativistic approach ; and proposes a novel alternative - explanation . </S>",
    "<S> the new alternative explanation is based on refraction - phenomenon of optics . </S>",
    "<S> estimation of results with new approach are in agreement with known values . though physics is different , but it is argued that general - relativity based gravitational - bending and refraction based bending have more in common than is generally realized . also discussed are black - hole and gravitational - lensing in the new perspective of refraction . </S>",
    "<S> the new refraction - based theory makes a few new predictions and also suggest a few tests .     </S>",
