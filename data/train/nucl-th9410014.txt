    "in contrast to the pointlike electrons and positrons , nuclei are extended objects with an internal structure and a size given by the radius @xmath5 fm , @xmath6 being the mass number . also , the strong interaction between the nuclei in central collisions leads to a lower cutoff of useful impact parameters at @xmath7 . in the last years",

    "we give a short derivation of the inelastic double equivalent photon approximation ( depa ) and apply it to the nuclear gdr excitation .",
    "in this section we are going to compare the effective @xmath0-@xmath0 luminosities for ca - ca and pb - pb beams at the lhc with those of other colliders .",
    "we want to study whether the heavy - ion beams can compete with other colliders .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0-@xmath0 luminosities in the heavy - ion case using the semiclassical impact - parameter - dependent form of the photon density , as described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19-dependent equivalent photon number is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the total unrestricted @xmath0-@xmath0 luminosity is then given by @xcite @xmath22 where we have introduced a cutoff in the impact parameter , in order to discriminate for central collisions , where both ions interact strongly with each other . in order to have a clean signal",

    "the formula also includes correction due to the collisions , where the lepton can loose an appreciable part of its energy . for the next generation of photon - photon colliders , which are based on the compton backscattering of an electron beam in an intense laser beam @xcite",
    ", we use the results of fig .",
    "9 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "here we use the result for the `` conversion distance '' @xmath26 cm , where the photon luminosity is maximal .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lum_el ] we compare the unrestricted luminosities of these colliders .",
    "the different beam luminosities and energies used in the comparison are summarized in table  [ tab : collider ] .",
    "we see that the spectrum for @xmath17-@xmath17 collisions is much harder for higher invariant masses than that for heavy ions .",
    "this is due to the smaller radius of the proton . for small values of @xmath12 the different luminosities are mainly proportional to the beam luminosity and @xmath16 . for small enough @xmath12 ,",
    "the @xmath0 dependence is given by @xcite @xmath27 for the lhc , we see that the ca - ca collisions seem to be the desired choice , whereas the pb - pb case is even lower than the @xmath17-@xmath17 case for higher invariant masses",
    ".    the planned plc would be superior , as a dedicated photon - photon machine , for @xmath28 ; its energy range exceeds what will be possible with the lhc .",
    "please note that the photon - spectrum shown in the figure is only the low energy part of it .",
    "most photons are produced with energies in the tev region .",
    "but whereas the lhc is accepted now and will be in operation in 2004 or 2008 , @xmath0-@xmath0 colliders are only in a planning stage .",
    "therefore , we think that photon - photon physics at the lhc is an interesting option , extending the range of the invariant mass to energies not possible today .    as already discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the unrestricted luminosity is not the one relevant directly for experiments .",
    "depending on the detectors used , only a part of all photon - photon processes may be detected .",
    "which part of the processes are really observed , depends on the detector system and on the produced particles .",
    "the importance of such a cutoff can be demonstrated , by using a simple formula for a cutoff @xcite @xmath29 setting @xmath30 , we get a restriction on the @xmath18 range with @xmath31 and @xmath32    in fig .  [",
    "fig : lum_restricted ] we compare the restricted luminosities with the unrestricted ones for ca - ca and pb - pb . we see that they are reduced for small invariant mass as expected @xcite .    due to the factorization property of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lum ] ) , these luminosities can now be used easily in order to calculate the different @xmath0-@xmath0 processes , leading to the production of resonances and continuum states . for this",
    "we need the cross sections for the photon - photon subprocess .",
    "we refer here to the large literature on this subject , especially the production of heavy quark systems , the production of the higgs boson and of supersymmetric particles @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the electron and positrons , nuclei are extended objects with a rich excitation spectrum . now in connection with the planning of the experiments , the question arises how this nuclear structure influences the @xmath0-@xmath0 spectrum . in section [ sec : luminosity ] the effect of the finite size of the nucleus is fully accounted for by the introduction of the cutoff @xmath33 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) in impact parameter space , i.e. , the elastic charge form - factor of the nucleus is included .    in the following we consider two different effects , which lead to excited nuclear states .",
    "firstly a higher order electromagnetic process where there is , in addition to the @xmath0-@xmath0 process , an inelastic @xmath36 interaction .",
    "the process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdr_coh ] .",
    "the two different processes can be seen as independent , if we assume , that the elastic form factor , which is determined by the size of the system , remains nearly the same .",
    "then it is simplest to adopt the semiclassical impact parameter approach .",
    "the probability for a @xmath37 process and the @xmath38 process is given by the product @xmath39 integrating from @xmath40 up to infinity , we obtain for the cross section for @xmath37 fusion accompanied by a specific @xmath38 interaction @xmath41    since @xmath42 ( where the sum over @xmath43 includes the ground state also ) , we have @xmath44 @xmath45 is the cross section of the @xmath46 process alone , without any higher order processes , which was calculated up to now .",
    "we define @xmath47 as the cross section for a @xmath37 process , not accompanied by a @xmath36 interaction , and @xmath48 , where such an interaction takes place .",
    "an estimate can be given using the following argument : usually the integrand will be peaked at @xmath49 , and we approximate therefore @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "impact parameter dependent probabilities were calculated in @xcite .",
    "they depend strongly on @xmath6 . especially important",
    "is the excitation of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , which is assumed to be located at @xmath54 the excitation probability can be calculated , assuming that it has zero decay width and that it exhausts the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rule .",
    "as the probability for this excitation becomes large for pb - pb - collisions , we include in our calculation the effects of multiphonon excitation .",
    "the sum over all these excitations is given by ( see eq .",
    "( 3.2.4 ) of @xcite ) @xmath55    this gives an excitation probability of about 40% for pb and of about 1% for ca at @xmath40 .",
    "as each of the ions can be excited , we get a total probability for the excitation of at least one of them of about 2% for ca and of about 65% for pb . with less probability the quasideuteron region , the nucleon resonances and also the nuclear continuum",
    "are excited . while these effects are appreciable for the pb - pb case , the effects are only of minor importance for lighter systems like ca - ca , due to the strong @xmath3 dependence .    a detailed calculation of the cross section using the @xmath19 dependent probability as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pgdr1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : pgdr2 ] ) and integrating numerically over the impact parameter gives the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : lum_gdr_coh ] .",
    "these are in qualitative agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : gdr_el ] ) . whereas eq .",
    "( [ eq : gdr_el ] ) is too high for small invariant masses , it gives the right order of magnitude for large ones .",
    "this is due to the fact , that processes with small invariant mass are possible at larger impact parameter , whereas high invariant masses are possible only for close collisions .",
    "most frequently the excitation of the gdr state is followed by neutron evaporation .",
    "this leads to a change of the mass to charge ratio of the nucleus and the fragments will be lost from the circulating beam and can possibly be detected in a zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) .",
    "in addition to the elastic epa of sec .  [ sec : luminosity ] , where the nucleus remains in its ground state during the photon emission process , there are also elastic - inelastic and even inelastic - inelastic processes , where the emission of the photon leads to the excitation of the nucleus .",
    "the corresponding situation was studied by ohnemus et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath17-@xmath17 collisions , who found that inelastic processes are a non - negligible contribution in this case .",
    "let us say a few words about the qualitative differences between the @xmath17-@xmath17 and @xmath6-@xmath6 case .",
    "a typical inelastic - elastic process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iepa_gdr ] . in the appendix",
    ", we give a short derivation of the generalization of the elastic epa to inelastic processes . on the one hand",
    ", we get a modification of the formula due to the different vertex factor , on the other hand , the minimal @xmath56 is modified as we have an inelastic process . for the most important case of the gdr excitation the spectrum of the equivalent photons is also given in the appendix . as demonstrated there ,",
    "the spectrum is much more sensitive to the detailed form of the form factor in the inelastic case as in the elastic case .",
    "therefore we have used two different form factors , a dipole form factor given by @xmath57 and a gaussian form factor @xmath58 integrating over @xmath59 , we get the luminosities for the elastic - inelastic processes as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : lum_iepa_pb ] and  [ fig : lum_iepa_ca ] .",
    "the contribution of the elastic - inelastic processes are about 1% , so the detailed form of the form factor is not important in this case .",
    "inelastic processes are only a small correction .",
    "this can be understood from the fact , that the electromagnetic transition current remains finite for @xmath60 only in the elastic case .",
    "for inelastic processes it vanishes at least with @xmath61 , compensating therefore the enhancement of the process due to the small @xmath56 in the photon propagator .",
    "another process , which has to be considered , is the incoherent scattering of an individual proton instead of the whole nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dis ] ) , where @xmath56 is larger than @xmath62 .",
    "it seems interesting to compare the elastic and inelastic contributions to the equivalent photon spectrum in the @xmath17-@xmath17 and @xmath6-@xmath6-cases ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a proton as being made up of @xmath63 and @xmath64 quarks , with charges @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "a nucleus is made up of @xmath3 protons , which are then made up of quarks . whereas the charge of the proton is comparable to the charge of its individual constituents , the charge of the nucleus is much larger than the charge of its constituents , if @xmath67 .",
    "thus for nuclei , the equivalent photon spectrum is dominated strongly by the coherent component , where @xmath68 , whereas for protons the individual , incoherent quark contributions are comparable , or even larger , than the elastic component .",
    "this is in accordance with the quantitative results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite to use @xmath69-pair - production as a luminosity monitor for the @xmath17-@xmath17 and the @xmath6-@xmath6 collider .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath0 mechanism dominates for collisions with no strong interactions between the protons .",
    "this condition can be assured experimentally .",
    "in addition to the elastic and incoherent contributions , also the transition to nucleon resonances , notably the @xmath70 , have to be taken into account . since the relevant electromagnetic form factors are known , a reliable calculation of the @xmath69 production via the @xmath0-@xmath0 mechanism should be feasible . the same formalism , which was used here for the gdr excitation of a nucleus ,",
    "can also be used for this case .",
    "this is the subject of future work , beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the possibility to do photon - photon physics with heavy ions at lhc energies was scrutinized .",
    "we calculate unrestricted and restricted luminosities for pb and ca . for large invariant masses heavy ions notably ca - ca , with its relatively high luminosity ,",
    "compare very favorably with lep200 , e.g .. for very high invariant masses , @xmath71gev , the @xmath17-@xmath17 option becomes better ; this is essentially due to the harder form factor of the proton as compared to the softer nuclear form factor . in the far future",
    "a dedicated photon - photon collider ( like plc ) will have a larger @xmath0-@xmath0 luminosity than the @xmath72 options over most of the interesting invariant mass regions .    also with the aim to help planning experiments , higher order and other possibly important correction factors were investigated .",
    "we find that for very high @xmath3 , like pb - pb , most of the @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions are accompanied by a nuclear excitation , predominantly gdr excitation .",
    "for the ca - ca case such effects are almost negligible .",
    "we show that in contrast to the @xmath17-@xmath17 case @xmath0-@xmath0 events from inelastic photon emission are of minor importance for @xmath72 collisions . we conclude that @xmath0-@xmath0 physics at the lhc looks promising",
    "of course , more detailed studies , also of the experimental design , will be necessary .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank k. eggert , h. gutbrod , a. morsch , s. sadovsky , and j. schukraft for their helpful , encouraging and stimulating comments .",
    "our derivation for the equivalent photon approximation generalized to inelastic processes follows in principle that of @xcite ( using a slightly different definition of @xmath73 ) . in this short derivation",
    "we will not discuss the general applicability of the epa , but safely neglect the contribution of the longitudinal photons in comparison to the transversal photons .",
    "for a detailed discussion of the applicability see , e.g. , @xcite .    the cross section for the process ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : iepa_gdr ] ) is given by @xmath74 where we do not make any assumptions on projectile and target and also on the produced system @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 is the total momentum of this system @xmath75 , @xmath77 its phase space .",
    "@xmath78 is given by @xmath79 with the momentum of the virtual photon @xmath80 and the electromagnetic transition current @xmath81 .",
    "in the epa we neglect the dependence of @xmath82 on @xmath83 and replace it with the one for real photons .",
    "therefore @xmath82 depends only on @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "averaging over the initial state and summing over the final state , we get the `` photon densities '' @xmath86 @xmath87 it is well known from general invariance considerations that the general form of @xmath86 for an arbitrary transition has to be of the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are function of invariants only .",
    "if the particle is moving relativistically , the photon momentum is almost aligned to the beam axis . in the epa , we need only the transverse components of @xmath91 , transverse with respect to @xmath61 . in the relativistic case ,",
    "these transverse components are given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the absolut value of the spatial components of the heavy ion momentum and we have already averaged over the transverse plane , which is normally not measured .",
    "the @xmath94 are the two transverse polarizations of a corresponding real photon .",
    "we see that the photon density is proportional to the unpolarized real photon density . using the formula for the real photon - photon cross section",
