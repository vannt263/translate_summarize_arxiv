    "random polytopes are among the most classical and popular models considered in geometric probability , and their study has become a rapidly developing branch of mathematics at the borderline between geometry and probability .",
    "one reason for the increasing interest are the numerous connections and applications of random polytopes in algorithmic geometry , convex geometric analysis , optimization , random matrix theory , set estimation or multivariate statistics ; we direct the reader to the surveys of brny @xcite , hug @xcite and reitzner @xcite for further information and references .",
    "a common method to construct a random polytope is to take the convex hull of a finite family of random points that are uniformly distributed in the interior of a prescribed convex body @xmath1 with @xmath2 . in their seminal paper , rnyi and sulanke @xcite",
    "considered the asymptotic behaviour of the mean vertex number and the mean volume ( area ) of such random polytopes if @xmath3 , as the number of points tends to infinity .",
    "since then , first - order asymptotic properties of geometric characteristics of random polytopes have been investigated for general space dimensions by brny @xcite , brczky , hoffmann and hug @xcite , reitzner @xcite or schtt @xcite , to name only a few .",
    "more recently , the focus has turned towards asymptotic second - order characteristics like the variance of the number of vertices or the variance of the volume .",
    "the classical efron - stein inequality has been used by reitzner @xcite to obtain upper bounds for these variances as well as laws of large numbers . matching lower bounds together with related central limit theorems",
    "have been shown on different levels of generality by brny and reitzner @xcite , cabo and groeneboom @xcite , groeneboom @xcite , hueter @xcite , pardon",
    "@xcite , reitzner @xcite , schreiber @xcite and vu @xcite .",
    "this line of research has been continued in a series of remarkable papers by calka , schreiber and yukich @xcite , calka and yukich @xcite , and schreiber and yukich @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the typical or ` normal ' behaviour of random polytopes , much less is known about their atypical or exceptional behaviour , or at scales in between . for random polytopes in the unit ball , calka and schreiber @xcite",
    "have obtained information on large deviations for the vertex number and schreiber @xcite has computed certain moderate deviation probabilities for the mean width .",
    "moreover , the paper of vu @xcite deals in a general context with concentration inequalities for the volume and the vertex number .",
    "besides such large deviation or concentration inequalities , it is from a probabilistic point of view also natural to ask for the behaviour of geometric characteristics associated with random polytopes on intermediate scales ` between ' that of the above - mentioned law of large numbers and that of a central limit theorem .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to fill this gap and to prove a set of concentration inequalities in the case where the underlying convex body @xmath4 is the @xmath0-dimensional unit ball @xmath5 and where the family of random points is induced by a poisson point process ( poisson polytopes ) .",
    "we refer to the papers of affentranger @xcite , buchta and mller @xcite , calka and schreiber @xcite , hsing @xcite , kfer @xcite , mller @xcite and schreiber @xcite for distinguished results about random polytopes in @xmath5 .",

    "our theorem basically recovers the exponential term in vu s inequality . however , while vu s inequality involves the boundary term @xmath21 , which does not depend on @xmath23 , such a term is not present in theorem [ thm : ldi ] .",
    "furthermore , our inequality yields an exponential estimate for all @xmath13 and not only for values of @xmath23 close to zero .",
    "we also emphasize that the inequality in theorem [ thm : ldi ] remains valid for a wide class of geometric functionals , while in @xcite besides of @xmath25 only the volume of @xmath12 is treated .",
    "on the other hand , theorem [ thm : ldi ] deals with the case of a random polytope in the unit ball , whereas in @xcite arbitrary underlying convex bodies are permitted .",

    "we will see in theorem [ thm : mdpscalargeneral ] below that the set @xmath31 appearing in theorem [ thm : mdpscalar ] can be replaced in a way by an arbitrary measurable subset @xmath32 and that the rescaled vertex number of the random polytope @xmath12 satisfies a so - called moderate deviation principle .",

    "in addition , we will work on the level of empirical measures and thus take care also of the spatial profile of the involved functionals .",
    "this in turn puts us in a position to present our announced moderate deviation principle also on the level of measures .",
    "let us emphasize at this point that theorem [ thm : mdprobabs ] and its generalization in theorem [ thm : mdprobasgeneral ] as well as the moderate deviation principles in theorem [ thm : mdpscalargeneral ] and theorem [ thm : mdpmeasuregeneral ] seem to be the first results in this direction in the context of random polytopes and that we were not able to locate counterparts in the existing literature .    instead of taking the convex hull of random points , it is also natural to consider random sets that arise as intersections of random half - spaces , see the surveys of hug @xcite and reitzner @xcite",
    ". to understand the geometric and the combinatorial structure of such random polyhedra is of importance , for example , in linear optimization . in particular , the performance of the well - known simplex algorithm depends on the number of edges of the polyhedron that is defined as intersection of the set of half - space determined by a system of linear inequalities .",
    "one way to obtain a deeper insight into the generic combinatorial complexity that arises in such situations is to consider random polyhedral sets as argued in borgwardt s monograph @xcite . by a duality argument borrowed from the works of calka and schreiber",
    "@xcite we transfer our results for random polytopes to combinatorial parameters of a certain class of random polyhedra that are associated with poisson hyperplanes ( poisson polyhedra ) .",
    "in particular , this includes the prominent typical cell of a stationary poisson - voronoi tessellation of @xmath6 conditioned on having a large inradius . in this context",
    ", we also contribute to the results around d.g .",
    "kendall s conjecture asking for the asymptotic geometry of ` large ' tessellation cells and for which we refer in particular to the paper of hug and schneider @xcite as well as to the references cited therein .",
    "let us briefly comment on the technique we use to derive theorems [ thm : ldi][thm : mdpscalar ] and their generalizations stated in section [ sec : mainresults ] .",
    "it is based on precise estimates of the cumulants of the involved random variables .",
    "the methodology to deduce fine probabilistic estimates from bounds on cumulants goes back to the ` lithuanian school of probability ' and is presented in the monograph of saulis and statuleviius @xcite . in the context of geometric probability",
    "this has been used by eichelsbacher , rai and schreiber @xcite to deduce results similar to those presented above for a class of so - called stabilizing functionals . however , the random polytope functionals we consider behave quite differently and are not within the reach of the results in @xcite .",
    "instead , we use the principal idea from @xcite that connects @xmath12 with a parabolic growth process in the upper half - space .",
    "the key advantage of this connection lies in the fact that in the rescaled parabolic picture spatial correlations are much easier to localize and to describe .",
    "we then develop the methods from @xcite and @xcite further to make the cumulant approach available in the context of the random polytopes @xmath12 .",
    "our probabilistic estimates then follow from the main ` lemmas ' in @xcite and the moderate deviations from the work of dring and eichelsbacher @xcite .",
    "the main technical difficulty in carrying out this approach is that only the points of the poisson point process @xmath8 close to the boundary of @xmath5 contribute to the geometry of @xmath12 , an effect that does not occur for the models considered in @xcite , but which is typical for random polytopes .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in section [",

    "our main theorems for poisson polytopes are presented in full generality in section [ sec : mainresults ] , while the final section [ sec : proofs ] contains their proofs . in section [ sec : hyperplanes ] we apply our main results to a parametric class of random polyhedra that arise from poisson hyperplanes .",
