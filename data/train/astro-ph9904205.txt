    "compact galactic nuclei are a common but still poorly understood feature of many , if not most spiral galaxies , including our own milky way . such nuclei are regions only a few parsecs or less in diameter , but have complex structures and sometimes produce energy outputs equal to a significant fraction of the total galaxy luminosity . for the present work we define a _ compact nucleus _ as a non - stellar , point - like light enhancement at or near the center of a galaxy",
    "whose brightness is in excess of an extrapolation of the galaxy light profile from the surrounding regions ( e.g. , phillips  1996 ) and which is dynamically distinct from the surrounding galaxy disk .",
    "compact nuclei are not simply nuclear  regions , although in some cases , they may be one component of a composite nucleus ",
    "they may be embedded in a nuclear region , a nuclear starburst region , or a nuclear disk ( e.g. , filippenko 1989 ; van den bergh 1995 ; ford  1997 ) .",
    "compact galactic nuclei include both `` active galactic nuclei '' or `` agns '' ( i.e. , qsos , seyferts , liners ) , which exhibit characteristic emission lines and non - stellar spectral energy distributions , as well as `` compact star cluster nuclei '' , whose properties can be accounted for by dense concentrations of stars .",
    "compact star cluster nuclei are the densest known stellar systems , with even modest examples containing a mass of more than 10@xmath7 within a few parsecs radius ( e.g. , lauer  1998 ; hereafter l98 ) .",
    "star cluster nuclei differ from scaled - up versions of normal dense star clusters in that they exhibit a wider range of stellar ages , quantities of associated dense gas , and sometimes evidence for the the existence of central massive black holes .",
    "possible evolutionary links between agns and compact star cluster nuclei are still widely debated ( e.g. , norman & scoville 1988 ; filippenko 1992 ; williams & perry 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "compact galactic nuclei can be difficult to pick out even in nearby galaxies .",
    "studies from the ground are limited by the effects of seeing and confusion with bright bulges or regions of enhanced star formation in galaxy centers . moreover , in the past , due to the limited dynamic range of photographic plates , exposures that revealed the outer structures of galaxies often overexposed the nuclear regions , thus obscuring compact nuclear sources ( e.g. , van den bergh 1995 ) . for some time",
    "it was accepted that compact nuclei were mainly limited to dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. , binggeli  1984 ; binggeli & cameron 1991 ) and to elliptical galaxies or early - type spiral bulges in which massive ( @xmath8 ) black holes appear to be commonplace ( e.g. , ford  1997 ; van der marel 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "however , high - quality photographic plates and high dynamic range ccd images , where the nuclear regions of galaxies are not `` burned in '' , have helped to change our perceptions on the range in properties of compact nuclei and on the types of galaxies that may harbor them ( e.g. , van den bergh 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , it has become evident that true compact nuclei are common in low - luminosity , late - type ( scd - sdm ) spiral disks that lack a bulge component ( i.e. , `` extreme late - type spirals '' ) . although the compact nuclei of extreme late - type spirals are often relatively faint ( @xmath9 ) , in nearby galaxies they become readily detectable even from the ground under normal ( @xmath10 ) seeing conditions , since confusion from bulges or brilliant circumnuclear disks is minimal , and dust obscuration is often low .",
    "for example , matthews & gallagher ( 1997 ) noted the existence of moderate - to - low luminosity compact , semi - stellar nuclei in 10 of 49 nearby , extreme late - type spirals they imaged from the ground . in a snapshot survey with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) , phillips  ( 1996 ) also found compact nuclei in a number of nearby , late - type , low - luminosity spirals ( see also carollo  1997 ) .",
    "compact nuclei may be common in pure disk galaxies at least to moderate redshifts .",
    "sarajedini  ( 1996 ) found that in a magnitude - limited survey ( @xmath1121.5 ) , 84 of 825 galaxies contained unresolved nuclear sources .",
    "of these , 57% of the host galaxies could be adequately modelled by an exponential disk alone , with no bulge component ( see also sarajedini 1996 ) .    the bulk of the compact nuclei in nearby extreme late - type spirals appear to be of the `` compact star cluster '' variety ( e.g. , shields & filippenko 1992 ; phillips  1996 ) .",
    "nearby examples include the nucleus of the local group scd spiral m33 ( e.g. , kormendy & mcclure 1993 ; hereafter km ; l98 ) and the nucleus of the sd spiral ngc  7793 ( daz  1982 ; shields & filippenko 1992 ) .",
    "however , in a ground - based spectroscopic survey of 43 scd and later nucleated galaxies , ho ( 1996 ) reported that a surprising 16% of these objects showed evidence for nuclear activity ( i.e. , seyfert , liner , or `` transition '' nuclei ) .    among the handful of examples of compact nuclei in low - luminosity disk galaxies that have been studied in detail ,",
    "there have been other surprises .",
    "one of the nearest qsos ( 0351 + 026 at @xmath12=0.036 ) was found by bothun  ( 1982a , b ) to lie within a faint ( @xmath13),=75  mpc@xmath14 is assumed throughout this work . ]",
    "blue , moderately low surface brightness disk galaxy .",
    "moreover , it is interacting with a nucleated , low surface brightness , gas - rich galaxy with @xmath15 ( bothun   1982b ) .",
    "kunth  ( 1987 ) were the first to image the galaxy g1200 - 2038 associated with a seyfert  2 nucleus .",
    "the host galaxy is a very small , faint dwarf galaxy ( @xmath166  kpc and @xmath1716.8 ) .",
    "the detailed morphology of this galaxy is uncertain , but it is well represented by a pure exponential disk , and its small physical size and low luminosity are consistent with an extreme late - type spiral galaxy ( cf . matthews & gallagher 1997 ) . in spite of the properties of the host galaxy , the nucleus of g1200 - 2038",
    "has a luminosity @xmath1816.1 , yielding a ratio of nuclear to host galaxy luminosity typical of much more luminous agns .",
    "such cases as these may hold important clues as to how different `` flavors '' of active nuclei are related , and they raise the question of whether compact nuclei in nearby extreme late - type spirals have special characteristics , or perhaps were much more powerful objects in the past that have since run out of fuel . furthermore , since moderate - to - low luminosity sd - sm spirals are the most common class of disk galaxy ( van der kruit 1987 ) , if low - level nuclear activity was commonplace in these objects , it may make a significant contribution to the soft x - ray background ( e.g. , koratkar  1995 ) .",
    "however , the majority of nuclei in nearby extreme late - type spirals appear to be either weakly active or non - active , and these galaxies therefore furnish examples of the little - explored low - luminosity regime for galactic nuclei and nuclear activity .",
    "the investigation of this faint end of the galactic nuclear activity sequence is critical for constraining the origin and evolution of compact nuclei and nuclear activity , as well as the physical processes that power them , since the existence of compact nuclei in small diffuse galaxies with weak central potentials and no bulge component is difficult to explain in light of current models for the origin of compact galactic nuclei and nuclear activity ( see sect .",
    "nonetheless , exploration of these systems is largely just beginning ( e.g. , filippenko & sargent 1985 ; ho  1995a,1997a , c ; koratkar   1995 ; maiolino & rieke 1995 ; sarajedini  1996 ) .",
    "still unanswered questions include : do all star cluster nuclei contain central black holes ?",
    "are young stellar populations centrally located within nuclei ? how do structures and spatial scales compare between active and non - active nuclei ? what is the minimum luminosity for an active nucleus ? because confusion with dust , light from the bulge , and bright circumnuclear material are minimized , detailed studies of the nuclei of nearby extreme late - types spirals can help to afford unique insights to many of these problems .    by studying the nuclei of extreme late - type spirals ,",
    "we can also hope to further our understanding of the role of the host galaxy in provoking and sustaining nuclear activity , and explore what relationships may exist between morphology , luminosity , or other global properties of the host galaxy and its nuclear characteristics .",
    "for example filippenko & sargent ( 1989 ) discovered the faintest seyfert  1 nucleus yet known ( @xmath19 ) in ngc  4395 , one of the objects we explore further in the present study .",
    "we also investigate the ` normal ' nuclei in the sd / sdm galaxies ngc  4242 and eso  359 - 029 , and analyze the nearby m33 nucleus as a comparison object .      constraining the physics of compact galactic nuclei",
    "requires resolution of their structures and measurements of their physical sizes .",
    "however , since half - light radii are typically @xmath2010  pc , even the closest spiral galaxy nuclei are difficult to resolve from the ground with conventional observing techniques ( e.g. , gallagher  1982 ; nieto  1986 ; mould  1989 ; km ) . in general , space - based observations with image quality of @xmath20@xmath21",
    "are needed to procure sufficiently detailed information to advance our understanding of these objects .",
    "the first such observations were supplied for m31 by the stratoscope  ii balloon - borne telescope ( light  1974 ) .",
    "more extensive data on structures of external spiral galaxy nuclei have come from ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical images obtained with the cameras aboard the _ hst _ that now achieve @xmath22@xmath23 angular resolution .",
    "even before its spherical aberration was corrected , the  displayed its resolving power by revealing that m31 has a double nucleus ( lauer  1993 ) , showing that compact nuclei are common in the uv ( e.g. , fabbiano  1994 , maoz  1995 ) , and by providing initial measures of galactic nuclear structures ( e.g. , crane  1993 ; lauer  1993,1995 ; king  1995 ; ford   1992 ; phillips  1996 ) .",
    "these results have been confirmed with optical and mid - uv images from the corrected optics of the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and the costar - corrected faint object camera ( e.g. , colina  1997 , devereux  1997 ) .",
    "aberration - corrected   images of the centers of a few nearby spirals show that typical galaxy nuclei are often unresolved in the uv , especially in galaxies with some evidence for activity . in the visible , nuclei of spirals",
    "can have complex surroundings ( e.g. as in m100 ) , and range in size from @xmath241  pc ( e.g. , m81 , as measured by devereux  1997 ) to core radii of 1.4  pc and 3.7  pc respectively for the p1 and p2 double nuclei of m31 ( lauer   1993 ; l98 ) .",
    "in this paper we present a wfpc2 investigation of the galactic nuclei of three extreme late - type , sd - sdm spiral galaxies .",
    "we also present an analysis of wfpc2 data of the nucleus of our closest scd spiral neighbor , m33 , in order to form a comparative framework for our analysis .",
    "all of these galaxies are dominated by their stellar disks and have little or no bulge component .",
    "our objectives are to study the optical structures , colors , and spatial scales of the low - luminosity , `` naked '' galactic nuclei found in these galaxies , and to compare these results with other compact galactic nuclei .",
    "a preliminary version of this work was presented by matthews  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the global properties of our program galaxies are described in table  1 .",
    "our first target , ngc  4395 , is an sad  iii - iv seyfert  1 galaxy ( filippenko & sargent 1989 , filippenko  1993 ) .",
    "ngc  4242 ( sabd  iii ) is morphologically similar to ngc  4395 ( cf .",
    "sandage & bedke 1994 ) , although slightly more distant , and its optically prominent nucleus does not appear to be active ( ho   1995a ) .",
    "the less luminous , nucleated extreme late - type galaxy , eso  359 - 029 ( sdm ) was selected from the sample of matthews & gallagher ( 1997 ; see also sandage & fomalont 1993 ) and is one of the lowest luminosity disk galaxies ( @xmath25 ) known to have a nucleus .",
    "eso  359 - 029 does not appear to be active , but a longslit spectrum ( matthews 1998 ) reveals the kinematic signature of a compact central mass concentration at the location of the nucleus .",
    "lastly , m33 ( sacd  iii ) and its nucleus have similar luminosities to our other targets , but because it is nearby , it is well - resolved and has been previously extensively investigated at multiple wavelengths ( see l98 ) .",
    "it therefore serves as an excellent comparison object , a check on the validity of our analysis techniques , as well as a guide for the interpretation of our results .",
    "images of ngc  4395 , ngc  4242 , and eso  359 - 029 were obtained for this program by the wfpc2 investigation definition team .",
    "the observations are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the nuclei of the galaxies were observed with the planetary camera  2 ( pc2 ) which gives a scale of @xmath26 per pixel on an 800@xmath27800 pixel loral ccd .",
    "we used a gain of 7  @xmath28 per data number ( dn ) , and the ccd was operated at a temperature of @xmath2988@xmath30  c. more details regarding wfpc2 can be found in e.g. , trauger  ( 1994 ) , holtzman  ( 1995a ) , or biretta  ( 1996 ) .",
    "since our program was limited to one orbit per galaxy , we obtained one short and two moderate , cr - split exposures for each object in the @xmath0 ( wfpc2 broad @xmath2-band ) and @xmath1 ( wfpc2 broad @xmath3-band ) filters .",
    "the short exposures were made to avoid saturated pixels in the bright centers of the nuclei .",
    "total exposure times for each object are given in table  2 .",
    "the @xmath0 filter includes the h@xmath31 and [ ] @xmath324959 , 5007 emission lines , which can be very strong near an agn .",
    "together , @xmath0 and @xmath1 give us a good color baseline .",
    "the data were reduced following the precepts of holtzman  ( 1995a ) and using the approach discussed by watson  ( 1996 ) for removing cosmic rays .",
    "calibrations of magnitudes and fluxes are based on the system described by holtzman  ( 1995b ) .",
    "the data for m33 were obtained from the archives of the canadian astronomical data centre .",
    "these data consist of recalibrated wfpc2 pc2 images taken in the @xmath33 ( wfpc2 @xmath34-band ) and @xmath1 filters , and were pipeline calibrated and combined in iraf to eliminate cosmic rays .",
    "the archival observations that we used are also summarized in table  2 .",
    "the @xmath1 images of each of our target nuclei are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in order to obtain information about the underlying structure and spatial scales of the nuclei of our target galaxies , we have produced simple models of their light distributions by fitting the data with combinations of point sources plus extended components with simple analytical forms .",
    "our approach is motivated by the need to extract information from objects which are only slightly resolved and to contend with the undersampling of the pc2 .",
    "both of these effects limit the ability to uniquely reconstruct brightness distributions of small angular size sources , such as nuclei ( e.g. , wildey 1992 ; bouyoucef   1997 ) . for non - active or weakly active nuclei ,",
    "our models are motivated physically by the structure of the milky way nucleus ( e.g. , mezger  1996 ) as it would appear at larger distances .",
    "our models are also appropriate for star cluster nuclei hosting agns ( e.g. , norman & scoville 1988 , perry & williams 1993 ) .",
    "our modelling approach has the advantage of requiring a minimum number of free parameters , while at the same time yielding measures of the characteristic sizes of the nuclei and limits on their central luminosity densities . because our approach does not rely on deconvolution methods , we avoid the addition of noise and spurious structures at small radii that can be introduced by such techniques ( e.g. , michard 1996 ) .",
    "deconvolution is especially problematic for undersampled pc2 data , where the solution is strongly dependent upon the pixel phase of the adopted psf ( see hasan & burrows 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , if the structures of nuclei are discontinuous at small radii , and discreet point - like features are present near their centers , such information would not necessarily be recovered through deconvolution techniques ( see sams 1995 ) .",
    "finally , our modelling approach allows us to locate off - center or unsymmetrical features in our nuclei .",
    "the point source contribution for our fits was modelled using the tiny tim version 4.1 software ( krist 1996 ) to produce a psf for the pc2 for the appropriate filter , approximate @xmath35 color , and the spatial position on the pc2 ccd .",
    "the psf was subsampled by a factor of 3 and then interpolated in order provide finer shifting and thus improve our ability to align the model psf with the observations . in all cases jitter corrections were negligible .",
    "for the extended component of our fits , we considered several different analytical forms for the brightness distribution ( see table  3 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath36=2.0 , model  ( 4 ) becomes the standard hubble - reynolds raw ( reynolds 1913 ; hubble 1930 ) . for @xmath36=0.25 , model  ( 6 )",
    "reduces to the de vaucouleurs @xmath37 law ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) , and in the case of @xmath36=2.0 , model  ( 8) is an isothermal sphere ( also known as a `` modified hubble '' or `` analytical king model '' ; see binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "model  ( 7 ) ( king 1962 ; 1966 ) also reduces to an isothermal sphere in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "as we discuss below , more complex models with additional free parameters can not be adequately constrained by the present data .    for each of our target galaxies we attempted fits to the nuclei using models of three categories : ( a ) pure psfs ; ( b ) pure extended models of each of the types listed in table  3 ; ( c ) combinations of a psf and extended models . for cases ( b ) and ( c ) , it was necessary to convolve the extended component model with our tiny tim model of the intrinsic psf of the optics and to account for the effects of pixel scattering on its observed appearance .",
    "we accomplished this transformation by subsampling the generated extended model component , convolving it with the central 9@xmath279 pixels of the subsampled tiny tim psf , rebinning to normal sampling , and finally , convolving the extended model with the pixel scattering kernel .",
    "our fitting procedure began with inputting initial guesses for the various free parameters in the models .",
    "any or all of the free parameters listed in table  3 were allowed to vary during fitting .",
    "in addition , we could also allow the peak intensity of the psf ( @xmath39 ) and the fractional pixel shift of both the psf center , @xmath40 , and of the extended component center , @xmath41 , to vary .    with our software ,",
    "fitting was accomplished using a two - dimensional non - linear least squares technique based on the curfit program of bevington ( 1969 ) .",
    "this method employs the marquardt ( 1963 ) algorithm , which combines a gradient search and an analytical solution derived from linearizing the fitting function .",
    "individual pixels were weighted using poisson statistics . in all cases ,",
    "a @xmath42 goodness - of - fit criterion was used to evaluate the quality of the models . for each fit",
    ", we show a 2-d representation of goodness - of - fit as : merit = ( data @xmath29 fit)@xmath43 weight .",
    "these are a useful tool for comparing the goodness of fit between different nuclei , since due to normalization uncertainties , the absolute values of the derived @xmath42 measures are difficult to compare directly .",
    "outputs from our fits included values for the free parameters for each model from table  3 , as well as for @xmath39 , @xmath41 , @xmath40 , the background level , and the integrated fluxes of the psf and the extended component contributions to the final fit .    to estimate the sensitivity of our fits to effects of time variability in the psf and camera focus , to mismatches between the true psf and our model psf , and to the relative strengths of the underlying psf and extended components",
    ", we generated test images composed of an _ observed _ @xmath1 psf with different focus values added to a model extended component .",
    "for the extended model we adopted a generalized hubble - reynolds law [ model  ( 4 ) ] with @xmath44=1.0 or 1.5 pixels and @xmath36=2.0 or 2.5 .",
    "we tested focus offsets of up to 5@xmath45 ( i.e. , 1/20@xmath46 ) , which is the maximum amount of defocus we expect to see in real images ( biretta  1996 ) .",
    "we then attempted to fit these test images with our fitting software using a nominal tiny tim psf in perfect focus , plus a generalized hubble - reynolds extended component .",
    "we repeated this procedure on test images where the relative strength of the psf component @xmath39 to the extended component @xmath47 ranged from 10 to 0.35 .",
    "regardless of focus , we found the fits output by our modelling software to underestimate the value of @xmath39 by @xmath223 - 5% .",
    "@xmath47 was accurately determined when @xmath39/@xmath47=0.35 but was overestimated by up to 33% in the case of @xmath39/@xmath47=10 .",
    "errors on @xmath36 range from 0 - 10% , depending upon both the ratio @xmath39/@xmath47 and the true @xmath36 of the test image . finally , for the in - focus test images , @xmath44 was systematically underestimated by 2 - 6% , while in the de - focused test images , @xmath44 was overestimated by 2 - 26% , depending on @xmath39/@xmath47 and the true underlying @xmath44 of the test image . in the discussions which follow ,",
    "we use the above results as partial guidelines for estimating the uncertainty of the fit parameters derived from our modelling technique .    as a second test of the accuracy of the psf models produced from tiny tim",
    ", we attempted to use appropriately scaled versions of the tiny tim models to subtract field stars from our observed image frames .",
    "we found the tiny tim models to accurately subtract the stars to within @xmath222@xmath48 .",
    "these residuals are consistent with those expected from the effects of poisson noise and the large - angle scattering in the wfpc2 camera that is not modelled by tiny tim .",
    "we adopt the tiny tim model psfs for our nuclear fits rather than using an observed psf from each frame , since the observed point sources on our frames are of rather low signal - to - noise .",
    "in addition , because the pc2 psf is position - dependent , the adopted psf must be interpolated to match the location of the observed nucleus .",
    "this can be done with much greater accurately with a subsampled tiny tim psf than with an observed psf .    from our tests we deduced the optimal extraction box size for fitting to be 31@xmath2731 pixels .",
    "this size included the bulk of each nucleus signal , while excluding most of the light from the large - angle scattering halo . because m33 is brighter and better - resolved ( and hence less sensitive to uncertainty in the psf halo )",
    "we extended its box size to 61@xmath2761 pixels .",
    "modest changes in box size caused maximum changes of a few percent in our derived fit parameters .      to assess",
    "how well we had resolved our nuclei , we attempted fits to the nuclei of all program images using a pure point source ( i.e. , a tiny tim psf ) .",
    "we find that _ none _ of the nuclei of our target galaxies can be adequately fit by a pure psf .",
    "2 illustrates this for the most distant nucleus in our sample , eso  359 - 029 .",
    "clearly a psf properly scaled to fit the profile wings grossly overestimates the central intensity .",
    "the mismatch is even more extreme in the other 3 cases .",
    "this implies that _ we have partially resolved the nuclei of all four of our program galaxies_. for ngc  4395 and m33 , the resolution is evident even from visual inspection of the images .      as a second step",
    ", we attempted to fit all four of our program nuclei using simple analytical brightness distribution models of the forms given in table  3 .",
    "we found that several of these models [ ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) ] could adequately fit the outer wings of the nuclear brightness profiles , but none was adequate to fit the data over the full range of @xmath49 for any of the nuclei . in all instances",
    "the models severely underestimated the flux in the central regions of the nuclei .",
    "3 shows this is the case even for the best resolved nucleus in our sample , m33 .      to better assess the nature of the light distributions of our nuclei over the full range of @xmath49 , our final series of modelling attempts consisted of fitting with combinations of a point source and an extended component from table  3 .",
    "our goal was not only to try to reproduce the brightness profiles of each individual nucleus , but to see if we could find a single , unified characterization of all of the nuclei that would allow meaningful comparisons between them .",
    "for this reason , we began with our best - resolved case , m33 .",
    "we first fit the m33 nucleus in the @xmath1 frame using combinations of a psf and several of the `` classic '' brightness distributions given in table  3 .",
    "the exponential disk+psf model fit the wings of the profile adequately , but overestimated the peak central brightness .",
    "the vaucouleurs @xmath37 law+psf model was a poor fit for almost the full range of @xmath49 , and significantly overestimated the peak brightness level .",
    "the hubble - reynolds law+psf combination roughly fit the shape of the profile for most values of @xmath49 , but underestimated the peak central intensity . by",
    "far the best fit came from the king law+psf fit , which provided an excellent model of the brightness profile for all values of @xmath49 and correctly reproduced the central intensity ( fig .",
    "4 ) . for this model we found the best fit occurred as @xmath50i.e . ,",
    "the best - fit king model tended toward the case of a simple , isothermal sphere [ model ( 9 ) ] .",
    "using more generalized fitting formulae with additional free parameters [ e.g. , models ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 8) ] only marginally improved our fits .",
    "one can trade off between @xmath36 and the characteristic radii of the models to produce a family of fits , none of them unique ( see also km ) .",
    "in general , the exponent @xmath36 becomes larger as the characteristic radius ( @xmath44 , @xmath51 , or @xmath52 ) increases .",
    "thus while they do reproduce the data adequately , these sorts of generalized fits have no obvious physical meaning , and do not permit useful comparisons between the different nuclei .",
    "nonetheless , one important result did emerge : for the modified king model we found @xmath53i.e .",
    "this more general form again tended toward the case of a isothermal sphere .",
    "together these results suggest that an isothermal sphere is an excellent approximation to the outer brightness distribution of the m33 nucleus , while at  resolutions , the center of the nucleus is indistinguishable from a point source .",
    "because our goal is to fit the observations with a useful and reproducible model rather than exploring all possible model fits ( see also km ) , we adopt for its simplicity and minimal number of free parameters , the isothermal sphere+psf ( hereafter is+p ) model as an analysis tool for all of our program nuclei .",
    "the emergence of the is+p model for our program nuclei suggests that _ to the resolution limit of our images , the central stellar density continues to increase in all four of our program nuclei . _",
    "although we can not conclusively rule out other classes of models from our present data ( cf .",
    "l98 ) , the is+p model provides a useful and physically motivated characterization of our program nuclei .",
    "below we present a more detailed analysis of the wfpc2 images of each of our nuclei , including results derived from is+p model fitting . for each case",
    ", we interpret our findings by incorporating results from the present work as well as prior results from the literature .",
    "because of the proximity of m33 , its very small bulge , and its moderate inclination , its nucleus can be effectively studied from the ground .",
    "spectra by van den bergh ( 1976 ) , gallagher  ( 1982 ) , and spectral synthesis models of oconnell ( 1983 ) and schmidt  ( 1990 ) show that a range of stellar ages , including stars younger than about 1  gyr , exist in the nucleus .",

    "we emphasize that m33 can not be assumed to be simply a massive version of an ordinary globular cluster because its characteristics and environment are much more complex .",
    "the wfpc2 images of the m33 nucleus that we present here were also recently analyzed by l98 .",
    "these authors found the m33 nucleus to be centrally peaked , which they interpret as a continuous increase in mean stellar density towards a central ` cusp ' .",
    "they also noted that the nucleus becomes somewhat bluer in color at small radii .",
    "l98 interpret this combination of properties as possibly being due to the presence of binary star merger products in the post - core collapse nuclear star cluster , as previously suggested by km . l98 use a deconvolution analysis to derive a fit to the nuclear light profile of m33 .",

    "we see evidence of a radial , jet - like feature in both the @xmath33 and the @xmath1 frames ( fig .",
    "this feature is roughly @xmath71 long , and contains two bright knots . in the present data , the structure of these two knots are both consistent with point sources to within errors , but their location , relative orientation , and colors are intriguing .",
    "the centroids of both of these bright spots lie along a radial line pointing directly toward the center pixel of the nucleus .",
    "the knots have absolute magnitudes ( corrected for galactic extinction ) of @xmath72=@xmath293.99 ( top ) and @xmath72=@xmath295.21 ( bottom ) , respectively , and there are no other discrete sources of similar luminosity in the outer parts of the nucleus or its surroundings . if these are single stars , they are rather luminous , and it is difficult to explain their highly disparate colors .",
    "the upper source is very red [ ( @xmath61)@xmath73=1.92 ] while the lower source is very blue [ ( @xmath61)@xmath73=@xmath290.22 ] ( see fig .  6 , discussed below ) .",
    "even if the sources we see are luminous stars , their alignment with the nucleus center raises the possibility that they may be associated with a jet or outflow of some sort .",
    "further investigation of these features is clearly desirable .",
    "if the m33 nucleus does harbor a miniature jet , this would provide evidence that m33 is indeed a low - level agn .",
    "we attempted fits to the wfpc2 images of the m33 nucleus using our modelling software , as described in sect .  3.2.3 .",
    "our is+p model reproduces the light profile of the m33 nucleus quite well , aside from small systematic errors due to the slight ellipticity of the nucleus .",
    "the mismatch between our circularly symmetric models and the slightly elliptical nucleus of m33 results in a symmetric residual pattern upon subtraction of the model ( fig .  4 & 7 ) .",
    "our derived core radius for the is component of the m33 nucleus from the @xmath1 image is @xmath74=@xmath75 , which is in good agreement with the measurements of km and mighell & rich ( 1995 ) , both of whom found @xmath65@xmath21 . as in the present work ,",
    "km also included a central point source to reproduce the compact central source or `` cusp '' in the brightness profile .",
    "our is model value for the core radius is an _ upper limit _ to the physical size of any core in the m33 nucleus .",
    "our value is larger than the slope break radius derived by l98 .",
    "these authors interpret the unresolved center of the nucleus as a density cusp , whose properties were measured via deconvolution .",
    "our core radius is derived from an isothermal sphere fit to only the _ resolved _ portion of the underlying nuclear star cluster .",
    "our resulting is+p model magnitudes agree well with our aperture photometry ( see sect .",
    "for example , the observed @xmath33 magnitude for a 25 pixel circular aperture is only 0.01 magnitude fainter than that derived from our model .",
    "we can derive a limit to the central luminosity density by assuming the flux in the model point source in the unresolved center of the nucleus emanates from a region whose size is less than one pc2 pixel . at the distance of m33",
    ", this corresponds to a volume with radius 0.092  pc , and the minimum @xmath34-band luminosity density for the m33 nucleus of 3.6@xmath2710@xmath76  pc@xmath70 . the l98 model yields a lower central density for the m33 nucleus since it assumes a continuous model for the nuclear radial brightness profile .",
    "the color map of the m33 nucleus ( fig .  6 ) suggests this nucleus has a blue core , as previously inferred by km , mighell & rich ( 1995 ) , and l98 .",
    "this result must be interpreted with caution due to the mismatch between the _ hst _ psfs at different wavelengths , but nonetheless , the spatial extent of the blue region on our color map ( @xmath223 pixels ) is consistent with the slightly bluer nuclear core measured by l98 in their deconvolved image . from aperture photometry ( see below ) , we measure a @xmath61=0.81 within a 3-pixel radius aperture , also consistent with fig .  21 of l98 .",
    "if real , this central concentration of blue light could represent a small cluster of young stars ( e.g. , stars , as suggested by massey  1996 ) , a miniature agn , or a single blue supergiant . if such discreet sources are present , then the fit of smooth power law to the radial intensity distribution becomes uncertain , as discussed by sams ( 1995 ) .",
    "similar behavior is also seen in the milky way s nucleus , but in this case it is due to a central concentration of luminous young stars ( krabbe  1995 , mezger  1996 ) . the central young cluster in the milky way nucleus would have a core radius of about @xmath77 at the distance of m33 , and",
    "therefore would appear as a blue point source superposed on an older , redder underlying cluster , similar to what we see in m33 .",
    "we also note that some blue light is present in the outskirts of the m33 nucleus ; consistent with the color profile shown in l98 , we see a faint , moderately blue ring surrounding the periphery of the entire nucleus ( see fig .",
    "it is clear that even low - mass nuclei such as that in m33 are more complicated than simple scaled - up versions of ordinary star clusters , and the radial intensity profile , especially in the central regions , may reflect more than the stellar density profile .",
    "therefore , caution must be exercised in assessing the dynamical state of compact nuclei from brightness profiles alone ( see km , l98 ) .",
    "because m33 is sufficiently resolved , we can also explore its brightness distribution using isophotal fits .",
    "we determined the run of surface brightness with radius for the @xmath33 10-@xmath78 exposure using the ellipse task in iraf . to match the slight elongation of the nucleus",
    ", we used a fixed ellipticity of @xmath79=0.15 at a position angle pa=18@xmath30 .",
    "the background was measured in the regions surrounding the nucleus , and a constant background was subtracted .",
    "the resulting observed radial brightness profile in the @xmath1-band is shown in fig .",
    "8 . for comparison",
    ", we also fitted the m33 nuclear brightness profile using circular isophotes . on an azimuthally - averaged brightness profile ,",
    "the results appear virtually indistinguishable from the elliptical fits , indicating the circular symmetry in the is+p models should not be a major source of uncertainty .",
    "since our other target nuclei are more distant than m33 , our wfpc2 observations in these cases suffer more severely from limited angular resolution .",
    "however , it is possible to make some comparative measures of the size and radial run of intensity in the outer regions of the other nuclei .",
    "this information provides a basis for testing the hypothesis that other star cluster nuclei in small spirals are structurally similar to the nucleus of m33 .",
    "it is useful , before undertaking this analysis , to first explore how the observed properties of the m33 nucleus would change if it were moved outside of the local group .",
    "as a test of the effects of distance on our model fits , we block averaged the @xmath1 image of the m33 nucleus by 5@xmath275 pixels to simulate its appearance at a distance of about 4  mpc ( hereafter `` m33-at - a - distance '' ) .",
    "the wfpc2 @xmath1 image was selected for this experiment because it is less affected by recent star formation or possible effects of weak nuclear activity , and so provides the best measure of the intrinsic properties of the underlying nuclear star cluster .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in this experiment comes from the fact that in a real galaxy , an unresolved source would have its flux distributed over the same number of pixels regardless of its distance ; however in our test image , the central point source was binned 5@xmath275 .",
    "our results for the is+p fits to the m33-at - a - distance nucleus are presented in table  4 and fig .",
    "these fits demonstrate a few basic points about the impact of resolution on the fitting process .",
    "the fraction of the total integrated model flux contained in the psf increases from 3.4% in m33 to 20% in m33-at - a - distance .",
    "the residuals from the is+p fit also become much smaller , demonstrating our lessened ability to resolve underlying structure of the nucleus , while at the same time the derived core radius of the extended model component yields a value @xmath221.3 times larger ( in parsecs ) than for the m33 nucleus at its proper distance .",
    "thus we can not measure the form of the central part of distant nuclei without knowing their radial intensity profile in advance .",
    "these effects are to be expected . with increasing distance",
    ", more of the nucleus light falls within an unresolved point source , and fewer resolution elements lie across the resolved component . as a result",
    ", the extended brightness component of the nucleus must be separated from the wings of a strong psf and can not be constrained as accurately .",
    "since the psf also effectively removes additional light from the extended component near the center of the image , the best - fitting extended component will necessarily have a shallower brightness gradient at small @xmath49 .",
    "thus any derived core radius for the is component of the intensity model will only be an upper limit to the intrinsic @xmath74 .",
    "sandage & fomalont ( 1993 ) first reported the presence of a point - like nucleus in eso  359 - 029 , but classified the host as an im / de , n `` mixed morphology '' galaxy , and argued that it is gravitationally bound to the sbc spiral ngc  1532 .",

    "in addition , a recent high - resolution   spectrum by matthews  ( 1998 ) shows that eso  359 - 029 is clearly rotationally dominated , that the velocity width reported by sandage & fomalont ( 1993 ) was underestimated , and that the /@xmath80 ratio of this galaxy ( 0.41 in solar units ) is entirely normal for extreme late - type spirals , while being a factor of 10 higher than typical de or dwarf spheroidal systems ( e.g. , oosterloo  1996 and references therein ) . for these reasons we believe",

    "many extreme late - type spirals , its global properties are similar to those of an irregular galaxy ( matthews & gallagher 1997 ) .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility that at least some nucleated de galaxies may form when gas is stripped from an extreme late - type spiral during a close encounter with another galaxy ( cf .",

    "the lack of discernible fir emission from this nearby spiral by _ iras _ and it relatively weak global radio continuum flux ( gioia & fabbiano 1987 ) both suggest a low rate of global star formation throughout the disk",

    "we find the ngc  4242 nucleus is unlike the other nuclei in our sample in two important ways .",

    "our is+p model provides a good fit to the @xmath0 brightness distribution , but in the @xmath1 band , this model can not properly reproduce the flux distribution in the central few pixels , and leaves an oval - shaped residual pattern roughly @xmath71@xmath27@xmath84 across ( see fig .  13 ) .",
    "this reveals that this nucleus in not circularly symmetric , and that it appears to contain a miniature bar - like feature near its center .",
    "we see marginal evidence for a similar feature in the @xmath1 image of eso  359 - 029 , but it is significantly less pronounced",
    ". this may be due to an intrinsic difference , or to the poorer spatial resolution in the eso  359 - 029 images .",
    "the second difference between ngc  4242 and the other nuclei is that ngc  4242 is the only one of the three non - active nuclei where the point source contribution to our model fits is larger in @xmath1 than in the bluer image .",
    "filippenko & sargent ( 1989 ) were the first to present evidence that the compact nucleus of ngc  4395 is the lowest luminosity seyfert  1 known .",
    "these authors discovered that the h@xmath81 emission line in the ngc  4395 nucleus has a broad component , and that the [ ] emission is much stronger than that of h@xmath31 .",
    "further support for the presence of an agn came from a uv spectrum taken with the faint object spectrograph on the _ hst _ by filippenko  ( 1993 ) which showed a flat far - uv continuum with strong , high ionization emission lines .",
    "no p - cygni profiles were found in the uv , such as would normally be present from winds in massive ob stars .",
    "in addition , filippenko  found the nucleus to be spatially extended in observations made with the original planetary camera through the @xmath85 filter ( a narrow - band  filter ) , while the continuum @xmath86 filter showed only a point source .",
    "sramek ( 1992 ) measured a non - thermal radio source with about the luminosity of the cas  a galactic supernova remnant at the position of the ngc  4395 nucleus .",
    "finally , lira & lawrence ( 1998 ) have recently reported the nucleus is a variable x - ray source .",
    "taken together , the spectral characteristics of the ngc  4395 nucleus appear to be more consistent with a standard accretion - powered agn rather than a compact starburst .    with our new wfpc2 data ,",
    "we have resolved the nucleus of ngc  4395 .",
    "this nucleus has complex internal structure . in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ,",
    "some degree of elongation is visible , and a faint halo of irregular `` fuzz '' can be seen surrounding the brighter core of the nucleus .",
    "because the ngc  4395 nucleus is less structurally complex in the @xmath1 frame , we modelled that image first .",
    "the resolution of the nucleus in @xmath1 is illustrated in fig .",
    "14 , where we have subtracted a scaled psf model to approximately fit the the central intensity .",
    "this leaves behind an extended , slightly elliptical residual pattern which contains about half of the light .",
    "a complete fit to the nucleus can be made with good accuracy using our is+p model ; this produces a point source and extended object centered at the same position to within better than 0.1 of a pc2 pixel ( @xmath875  milliarcsec ) .",
    "as with our other sample nuclei , the outer regions of the nucleus of ngc  4395 are reasonably fit by an is+p model ( fig .",
    "however , for ngc  4395 an asymmetric , bipolar - like pattern emerges in the residuals .",
    "the luminosity of the is component of ngc  4395 s nucleus in the @xmath3-band is @xmath8810.1 ( see sect .",
    "4.7 ) , similar to the resolved nuclear cluster components in the other galaxies in our sample .",
    "the luminosity and structural parameters of the ngc  4395 nucleus that we measure from the present data are consistent with ngc  4395 containing a normal star cluster nucleus which is currently hosting nuclear activity",
    ". however , final confirmation of this picture will require high angular resolution spectra .",
    "the ngc  4395 nucleus looks considerably different in the @xmath0 filter .",
    "two of the central pixels of the @xmath0 image were saturated in the long exposure , hence these were replaced by values derived by scaling from our short exposure ( see sect .  2 ) .    visually inspecting the @xmath0 image",
    ", we see that the nucleus of ngc  4395 is asymmetric and elongated ; it can be described as a point source superimposed on an elongated , somewhat irregular structure .",
    "we have selected the contour levels in fig .",
    "16 to attempt to illustrate this point ; note the displacement of the point source from the outermost isophote .",
    "furthermore , unlike the other nuclei , where the centers of the psf and is components to the fits coincide to within a fraction of a pixel ( see table  4 ) , the centroids of the psf and is components for the @xmath0 image of ngc  4395 are offset by 1.2 pixels , and the centroid of the is component differs from that found in the @xmath1 image by nearly 2 pixels .",
    "the luminosity in the point - source component is considerably higher than would be expected from the effects of distance alone ( based on our m33-at - a - distance experiment ) , arguing that this nucleus truly contains a very compact source near its center , consistent with other agns .",
    "a fit to the light distribution in the @xmath0 frame using our is+p model leaves a bipolar residual pattern similar to that in the @xmath1 frame , but much more pronounced , and containing an even larger fraction of the total nuclear light ( fig .",
    "17 ) . from our is+p model",
    "we place a limit on the minimum @xmath2-band luminosity density in the ngc  4395 nucleus of 9.6@xmath2710@xmath69  pc@xmath70 within a volume of radius 0.283  pc .",
    "further hints of the complex structure of the ngc  4395 nucleus can be gleaned from an examination of a @xmath89 color map ( fig .",
    "we see overall the nucleus is fairly blue , with a compact central source that appears to be somewhat bluer than the surrounding regions .",
    "there is also a short , bright blue arc ( @xmath22@xmath90 long ) offset just a few pixels from the nucleus center .",
    "this and the prominent extended blue plume visible to the right of the nucleus are discussed in detail below .    as with the @xmath1 frame , we examine the residuals left after subtracting only the point source component of our model ( fig .",
    "19 ) . from this",
    "we see evidence of a slight elongation at a pa=255@xmath30 ( at `` 2 oclock '' ) in the @xmath0 image .",
    "no analogous feature was seen in the @xmath1 image ( fig .",
    "the elongated structure is only weakly visible , but if the feature were simply an artifact of an error in the psf , we would expect to see a reflected symmetry in this structure , and we do not . the stronger evidence of the reality of these features is that it appears to correspond to a feature in our contour plot ( fig .  16 ) and to a distinct blue arc in the color map shown in fig .  18 . in the color map ,",
    "the arc - like feature is located about @xmath91 ( @xmath223  pc ) from the center of the nucleus .",
    "the structure of this arc and its extremely blue color are consistent with it being produced by emission lines from ionized gas ( see below ) .",
    "these asymmetric blue structures we see in the ngc  4395 nucleus are most readily understood if the light is due to gas rather than stellar emission ; dynamical time scales within nuclei are extremely short and thus any azimuthal irregularities in the distributions of stars will rapidly disappear in much less than 1  myr .",
    "a stronger confirmation of this picture comes from the consistency of our observed asymmetry in the ngc  4395 nucleus with that found by filippenko  ( 1993 ) in their @xmath85-band observations .",
    "this agreement suggests that the inner and outer filaments are due to regions where the h@xmath31 and [ ] emission lines are especially intense . using the wfpc2 efficiencies tabulated by biretta  ( 1996 ) , we find that the blue arc - like feature produces a flux in [ ] of @xmath92  ergs  s@xmath14  @xmath93 , which is about 1/4 to 1/3 of the [ ] flux measured from ground - based spectra by ho  ( 1997a ) , and corresponds to a luminosity of roughly 1@xmath68  .",
    "the @xmath0 image of ngc  4395 contains a second , large emission plume that is clearly resolved from the main nucleus .",
    "it is approximately aligned with the inner blue arc discussed above .",
    "this plume also has the blue colors expected for an emission line source , and is only faintly visible in the @xmath1 image .",
    "the outer plume has a wispy , filamentary structure , and extends about 1@xmath94 ( @xmath2220  pc ) in projected distance from the nucleus , with its main structure centered near pa=265@xmath30 .",
    "near pa=270@xmath30 , it makes a 90@xmath30 turn and joins onto a fainter region at pa=280@xmath30 .",
    "we detected an integrated flux from the outer plume is 44 photons  s@xmath14 , corresponding to corresponding to a flux in [ ] of 4@xmath95  erg  s@xmath14  @xmath93 , or @xmath96  erg  s@xmath97 .",
    "thus this emission line plume , together with the arc discussed above , contain 1/2 - 2/3 of the [ ] flux found by ho   ( 1997a ) in their spectra taken with a 1@xmath984@xmath94 entrance aperture . since ho  ( 1997a ) quote an uncertainty of @xmath5720% for their measurement , our values are in rough agreement .",
    "we therefore believe that these two features comprise the bulk of the narrow emission line region around the seyfert nucleus of ngc  4395 .",
    "our observations of the structure and luminosity of the ngc  4395 nucleus and its surroundings are consistent with the behavior of more luminous agns .",
    "normal seyfert galaxies often show `` ionization cones '' along which highly ionized material is found ( e.g. , pogge 1989a , b ; wilson   1993 ; boksenberg  1995 ; mulchaey  1996 ; schmitt & kinney 1996 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is interpreted as blocking or collimation of radiation from the vicinity of an accreting black hole .",
    "the presence of two distinct filaments along approximately the same position angle from the nucleus gives strong evidence for the presence of an ionization cone in ngc  4395 .",
    "this feature , in combination with the spectrum and brightness of the probable [ ] line emission , provide further support to the presence of an agn within the central parsec of the ngc  4395 star cluster nucleus .",
    "these factors strengthen arguments against a stellar origin ( e.g. , the `` warmer '' model of terlevich & melnick 1985 ) for the activity in ngc  4395 ( see also filippenko  1993 ) .      the emergence of the isothermal sphere as a suitable approximate model for the outer brightness profiles of our nuclei suggests that the nuclei of all of our sample galaxies harbor true compact nuclear star clusters , not simply small , nuclear  regions .",
    "in contrast to the isothermal sphere , the more general king law ( king 1962,1966 ) includes a finite value for the cutoff or `` tidal '' radius @xmath99 ( see eq . 5 ,",
    "table  3 ) .",
    "what does it mean then that our present nuclei are better fit as @xmath100 ( or equivalently , @xmath50 ) than with the more general king law ?",
    "one possibility is that we are unable to measure @xmath99 due to our limited field of view and confusion from the background light of the galaxy .",
    "however , in the center of a rigidly rotating galaxy , the tidal radius loses its usual physical interpretation , and the nucleus may simply blend into the disk , as discussed by km .",
    "the result would then be a very slow drop - off in stellar density from a nuclear star cluster in galaxies with shallow central gravitational potentials ; stars will only become unbound from the cluster at radii where the effects of galactic rotation begin to dominate .",
    "a comparison of the properties we derive for our sample nuclei from is+p model fitting reveal both some interesting similarities and some important differences .",
    "the fit results yield two cases ( m33 and eso  359 - 029 ) where a larger percentage of the integrated model fluxes lie in the point source component at bluer wavelengths .",
    "since the intrinsic resolution is slightly better at shorter ( bluer ) wavelengths , this may reflect a real , underlying property of these nuclei  i.e .",
    ", that they contain a compact , blue central source ( or possibly a blue `` cusp '' ) .    in comparing the core radii",
    "we derive for the is component of each of our nuclei ( table  4 ) , we see some expected effects of distance . as predicted from our test fits to m33-at - a - distance , the fraction of the total flux in the central psf increases from m33 to ngc  4242 at a distance of 7.5  mpc and again for eso  359 - 029 at 10.2  mpc . if the overestimation of the core radius that we measured for m33-at - a - distance can be assumed to scale roughly linearly with distance , we estimate that the star cluster components of all four of our sample nuclei have similar sizes . despite these uncertainties",
    ", we note that the nuclei for which we have both @xmath0 and @xmath1 data , our derived core radii from the is+p models are all @xmath222 times larger in the @xmath1 images than in f450w .",
    "this result is independent of the differing fraction of the flux in the psf component in the different galaxies .",
    "this provides a tantalizing hint that our inactive nuclei have underlying structural similarities ",
    "an outlying population of old or intermediate age red stars dominating the light at larger radii , and an increased blue luminosity contribution toward the center .",
    "this type of segregation is found in the milky way nuclear star cluster , although in the milky way nucleus the core radius of the older , red stars is @xmath225 - 10 times that of the inner blue population ( see eckart  1993 , rieke & rieke 1994 , krabbe  1995 ) .",
    "alternatively , blue nuclear cores could result from dynamical processes , such as enhanced binary production leading to excess populations of blue straggler stars ( km ; l98 ) , or ultra - low luminosity agns .",
    "we established in sect .  4 that none of our program nuclei are fully resolved .",
    "only the nucleus of m33 , which can be traced over a diameter of about 7@xmath94 ( 28  pc ) , comfortably exceeds the size of our model of the wfpc2 psf .",
    "however , in all cases the nuclei stand out from their surroundings on the wfpc2 images ( sect .",
    "5 ) , and thus aperture photometry is relatively straightforward .",
    "this is a major advantage of _ hst _ data , which typically offer at least ten times greater angular resolution than optical observations from the ground .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out using standard software packages in iraf .",
    "we selected aperture sizes to include approximately 90% of the light from each nucleus .",
    "for the m33 nucleus we used radii of 50 , 75 , and 85 pixels ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 diameters ) , 30 pixels radius ( @xmath104 diameter ) for ngc  4242 and ngc  4395 , and 20 pixels radius ( @xmath105 diameter ) for eso  359 - 029 .",
    "images were background - subtracted prior to photometering using background measures obtained from regions adjacent to the nucleus . because our galaxies all lack bulges , the disk background light was comparatively weak relative to the nucleus .",
    "we derived magnitudes in the wfpc2 system as described in holtzman  ( 1995b ) .",
    "these are given for each wfpc2 filter @xmath106 by : @xmath107 for observations made with gain=7 .",
    "@xmath108 is the data number , and the filter zero points , @xmath109 , are given in table  9 of holtzman  ( 1995b ) .",
    "we adopted observed zero points for the @xmath33 and @xmath1 filters and the synthetic zero point for @xmath0 .",
    "aperture ; there is no standard convention for adapting this system to extended sources . ] the resulting wfpc2 instrumental magnitudes for m33 were converted to @xmath110 magnitudes following holtzman  ( 1995b ) , while those of the other galaxies were transformed to the @xmath111 system using new relationships derived by holtzman ( 1998 ) : @xmath112 @xmath113    @xmath114 @xmath115    here @xmath116 and @xmath117 refer to the wfpc2 system magnitudes given by eq .  1 . our @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitudes are presented in table  5 .",
    "past ground - based measurements can be used to check our results for the m33 nucleus .",
    "photometry by nieto & aurire ( 1982 ) and by km yielded @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively . combining our observed value of @xmath120 with ( @xmath35)=0.68 measured by walker ( 1964 ) , we find excellent agreement between our new wfpc2 photometry and ground - based measurements , as well as with the wfpc2 measurements of l98 .",
    "our @xmath34-magnitude also agrees within errors with the value of @xmath34=13.82 measured by sharov & lyutyi ( 1988 ) .",
    "absolute magnitudes in table  5 are derived from the distances and extinction values given in table  1 .",
    "our sample is not large enough to adequately explore possible correlations between host galaxy luminosity and the luminosity of the nuclei , although we do find the most luminous nucleus ( that of m33 ) in the most luminous host galaxy and the least luminous nucleus ( that of eso  359 - 029 ) in the intrinsically faintest host galaxy .",
    "however , what is perhaps more intriguing is the _ similarity _ of the luminosities ( @xmath121 - 11@xmath122 ) of all of the nuclei in spite of the range in luminosities of their host galaxies from @xmath123 to @xmath124 .",
    "this demonstrates that nuclei of similar luminosities can be either active or non - active and raises the possibility that the nuclei share similar origins and long term evolutionary histories .    in spite of the fairly small range in luminosities of our target nuclei , the spread in their colors",
    "is significant . the most luminous nucleus , that of m33 .",
    "interestingly , m33 , while having the reddest nucleus in our sample , has the bluest nucleus in the local group ( sharov & lyutyi 1988 ) . ngc  4242 and eso  359 - 029 have intermediate colors , both somewhat bluer than typical globular clusters .",
    "finally , the active nucleus in ngc  4395 stands out because of its extremely blue optical colors , making it nearly as luminous as the m33 nucleus in the blue .",
    "these blue colors argue against the suggestion of carollo  ( 1997 ) that faint nuclear star clusters in quiescent disk galaxies are _ old _ stellar clusters , but rather hints that they could contain a mixture of stellar ages . alternatively",
    ", binary mergers in old star cluster nuclei could yield a range in optical colors ( see l98 ) , as could the presence of low luminosity agns .",
    "spectroscopy and spectral synthesis studies will be needed to better explore this issue .",
    "such studies may also yield clues as to why a spread of nearly one magnitude in @xmath5 exists among the three non - active nuclei in our sample .",
    "one possible explanation for the observed color spread is that episodic star formation occurs in these types of nuclei ( e.g. , firmani & tutukov 1994 ) .",
    "all three galaxies have similar inclinations ( @xmath125 ) , so reddening from extinction in the surrounding galactic disks is unlikely to contribute much to this spread .",
    "a striking characteristics of the nuclei in our sample is the visual appearance of each relative to its respective surrounding galactic disk . in all cases ,",
    "the nuclei are `` naked''i.e . , they appear very distinct from their circumnuclear environment , and there is little evidence for significant quantities of dust or other material at the centers of these galaxies ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "while to some extent , the nuclei in the present sample were selected on this basis , we have confirmed this holds even at space - based resolutions .",
    "these nuclei thus represent density contrasts of roughly 1000:1 compared to their surroundings .",
    "this point becomes especially evident in the @xmath1 image of ngc  4395 , where what appear to be two background galaxies can be seen through the disk , only tens of parsecs from the nucleus ( fig .",
    "21 ; for contrast with luminous spirals , see the collection of  nuclear region images of carollo  1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , for all of our sample galaxies , the continuum light from the galaxy disk is only weakly detected during the wfpc2 exposures , and we see no hints of spiral structure . while all the disks are actively forming stars as evidenced by the presence of h@xmath81 emission , there is little central concentration of star formation in any of the galaxies ( e.g. , wang  1997 ; gallagher & matthews unpublished ) .",
    "these properties of the nuclear regions of our sample galaxies set their nuclei apart from those in most other well - studied nearby spiral galaxies where the nuclei occur within an obvious bulge component , or the nuclei lie at the center of a spiral pattern ( e.g. , pimi 1987 and references therein ; carollo  1997 ; regan & mulchaey 1998 ) and where significant quantities of molecular gas and dust exist in the inner regions of the disk ( cf . , carollo  1997 ; devereux  1997 ) .",
    "a possible clue to the origin of star cluster nuclei in extreme late - type spirals comes from the observation of van den bergh ( 1995 ) that nuclei are _ not _ seen in irregular galaxies , even when these galaxies are of similar luminosities to the objects studied here .",
    "artyukh & ogannisyan ( 1991 ) also noted that compact nuclear radio sources ( indicators of nuclear activity ) are not generally found in irregular galaxies .",
    "this hints that somehow the presence of an organized disk is a requisite factor for the presence of a compact nucleus .",
    "the rotations curves of extreme late - type spirals tend to be almost linear to the last measured point in the optical galaxy and have very shallow velocity gradients ( e.g. , goad & roberts 1981 ; wevers 1984 ; matthews 1998 ) .",
    "this indicates that the centers of these galaxies are not particularly `` special '' places , and that they have relatively flat gravitational potential wells ( see also colin & athanassoula 1981 ) .",
    "this point was also emphasized by km and filippenko & sargent ( 1989 ) for the cases of m33 and ngc  4395 , respectively . by contrast",
    ", nucleated galaxies with luminous bulge components generally have steep density profiles with potentials pointing sharply towards their centers .",
    "there is some uncertainty whether the nuclei of our sample galaxies are even located precisely at the dynamical centers of these galaxies ( see also miller & smith 1992 ) .",
    "minniti  ( 1993 ) noted that the nucleus of m33 is displaced by @xmath126 from its small `` bulge '' component , and it is also displaced from the center of true neighboring disk isophotes ( de vaucouleurs & freeman 1970 ; colin & athanassoula 1981 ) .",
    "in addition , the velocity centroid of the nucleus of eso  359 - 029 appears to be displaced by @xmath227   relative to the galaxy centroid ( matthews 1998 ) . taken together",
    ", the global and dynamical properties of nucleated extreme late - type spiral galaxies raise interesting new questions on the symbiosis between the nuclei and the parent galaxies and on the origin of these centralized mass concentrations in otherwise very diffuse disks    various models proposed for the formation of nuclei in early - type galaxies are problematic for the `` naked '' nuclei in extreme late - type spirals .",
    "capuzzo - dolcetta ( 1993 ) and capuzzo - dolcetta & vignola ( 1997 ) have discussed the possibility that the nuclei of some early - type galaxies may form from globular clusters sinking to the center of the galaxies via dynamical friction .",
    "however , the efficiency of dynamical friction is greatly reduced in galaxies with low central densities ( e.g. , lin & tremaine 1983 ) making it doubtful that this scenario would be efficient in extreme late - type spirals .",
    "finally , it appears that at least some extreme late - type spirals do not contain significant numbers of globular cluster systems ( matthews 1998 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the nuclei formed _ in situ _ from gas infalling onto their centers either due to starbursts ( e.g. , firmani & tutukov 1994 ) or accretion of primordial gas clumps or small gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , loeb & rasio 1994 ) . while it seems plausible that infalling gas may have provoked episodic new star formation and altered the stellar populations of an _ existing _ nuclear star cluster in our galaxies ( e.g. , firmani & tutukov 1994 ; tutukov & krgel 1995 ) , it is still difficult to explain how gas infalling into shallow potentials like those in extreme late - type spirals could have formed the compact star clusters at their centers .",
    "less efficient angular momentum transport and weaker gravitational potentials in extreme late - type spirals provides a natural explanation for why they appear not to have formed supermassive black holes at their centers , but it can not account for the extraordinary compactness of the nuclear star clusters .",
    "this conundrum was pointed out by km with respect to m33 .",
    "our new data reveal that m33 is not an anomaly and that whatever the conditions necessary for the formation of a compact nucleus in extreme late - type spirals , these conditions commonly occur in these galaxies .    one possible means of delivering gas to galaxy centers to fuel activity or enhanced star formation is via a bar ( e.g. , shlosman  1990 ; ho  1995b ; ho 1996 ) .",
    "among our sample objects , ngc  4242 is generally classified as weakly barred , while none of the other galaxies , including m33 have obvious bars",
    ". ho ( 1996 ) also reported that bars do not appear to enhance the probability of finding a compact nucleus in galaxies later than sbc ( see also mackenty 1990 ; ho  1997b ; mulchaey & regan 1997 ) .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that secondary nuclear bars @xmath221  kpc in length may be needed to effectively transport material into the central parsec region of a galaxy ( e.g. , shlosman  1989 ; friedli & martinet 1993 ) .",
    "such features have been detected in a few galaxies ( friedli  1996 ) , but we do not see any evidence of such bars in our program objects . we can not however rule out that such structures may have existed in the past and aided the building of the observed nuclear star clusters .",
    "sofue & habe ( 1992 ) suggested that late - type ( sc and sd ) galaxies may have been formed in low density environments and suffered at most weak tidal interactions during their evolution .",
    "this explains the lower typical masses of these systems and their lack of large bulges . in this model ,",
    "early - type galaxies formed in denser environments and developed bulges via tidally - induced starburst events .",
    "if these interactions are also responsible for nucleus building and the fueling of agns ( e.g. , loeb & rasio 1994 ) , this also could explain the lack of evidence for supermassive black holes in extreme late - type spirals .",
    "the low - level activity in ngc  4395 may have been caused by a very weak interaction or the accretion of a small , gas - rich satellite that was not enough to cause a significant alteration in the appearance of the galaxy .",
    "in the rare cases , such as the galaxy 0351 + 026 , where extreme late - type spirals are observed to harbor more powerful active nuclei ( see sect .",
    "1.1 ) , the tidal effects believed responsible for this activity ( bothun  1982a , b ) may irrevocably change the appearance of the host galaxy , thus explaining the rarity of such objects in the present epoch .",
    "an alternative picture is that if primordial massive black holes are common in galaxies ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ) , the presence of one in a galaxy may lead to `` puffing '' of the disk ( e.g. , faber   1997 ; merritt 1998 ) and the formation of a bulge or spheroid ; hence , by definition , none of these systems will be observed as extreme late - type spiral disks ( cf .",
    "matthews 1998 ) .",
    "m33 is the only case where our present data can help to constrain a more detailed model of the dynamical evolution of the nucleus .",
    "because of its small velocity dispersion , the predicted relaxation time of the m33 nuclear star cluster is only @xmath1272 - 3@xmath128  yr ( assuming @xmath74=0.1  pc ; hernquist  1991 ; km ) .",
    "the colors of the m33 nucleus are also consistent with most of the stars being older than a relaxation time , so core collapse probably has occurred in m33 .",
    "our new upper bound to the the radius of any core in the nucleus of m33 strengthens this estimate of the relaxation time for simple models of core collapse ( e.g. , spitzer & hart 1971 ) , although the effects of stellar encounters , stellar evolution , and a range of initial stellar masses may still create order of magnitude uncertainties in this value ( km ; l98 ) .",
    "our measured value of the approximate core radius for our is model component of the nucleus of m33 ( 0.11  pc ) also agrees with theoretical predictions of the core - collapse scenario ( hernquist  1991 ) .",
    "l98 emphasize that stellar collisions may have particularly important consequences in the m33 nucleus , which lacks a supermassive black hole to stabilize its structure .",
    "however , it is likely that the structure of the m33 nucleus is more complex than that of an ordinary star cluster , and the detailed stellar mass density profile in the center of the nucleus is therefore still uncertain .",
    "these issues can be most directly resolved by spectroscopic observations designed to measure any radial trends in stellar content , possible signatures of a miniature agn , and the nuclear kinematics .",
    "we have shown that the nuclei of our program galaxies exist in similar , low density galactic disk environments and have similar luminosities and spatial extents .",
    "all of these factors provide evidence ( but not proof ) that the four nuclei have shared common formation histories and are comprised of roughly similar underlying nuclear star clusters .",
    "we postulate that the color and morphological differences we observe among the various nuclei may be due to relatively short - lived evolutionary phases ( e.g. , episodes of enhanced star formation or nuclear activity ) superposed on otherwise similar nuclear star clusters .    m33 s nucleus is the only one of our program objects for which the dynamical information exists , hence it is the only case for which a definite upper limit may be placed on the mass of a possible black hole at its center .",
    "we therefore know that any black hole in the nucleus of m33 must have a small mass ( @xmath129 ; km ; l98 ) .",
    "clearly similar measures for the other program nuclei are needed to further test the hypothesis that the other nuclei in our sample resemble the nucleus of m33 .",
    "a velocity dispersion measure is of particular interest in the case of ngc  4395 , since it can help to assess whether the activity in ngc  4395 is due to special properties , or whether it represents a transient phase that m33 may have experienced in its past .",
    "filippenko ( 1992 ) has estimated that if the nucleus of ngc  4395 contains a black hole accreting at roughly the eddington limit , the black hole mass would only be @xmath22100 .",
    "on the other hand , filippenko points out that the formalism of wandel & yahil ( 1985 ) applied to ngc  4395 yields an approximate black hole mass of 4@xmath2710@xmath59 .",
    "this estimate assumes that the observed cloud speeds in the ngc  4395 nucleus are produced by gravity .",
    "this black hole mass estimate is nearly identical to the upper limit derived for m33 by km and l98 , so it is consistent with the nuclei of these two galaxies harboring similar central massive compact objects .    further evidence for or against a `` unified '' picture for the nuclei of m33 and ngc  4395 could come from x - ray observations .",
    "filippenko   ( 1993 ) quoted an unpublished x - ray luminosity of the ngc  4395 nucleus of 6.6@xmath2710@xmath130  erg  s@xmath14 , which is consistent with the measurement obtained by cui ( 1994 ) .",
    "however , lira & lawrence ( 1998 ) report a mean @xmath131  erg  s@xmath14 ( for d=2.8  mpc ) with a factor of 2 variability over a 15-day period .",
    "this is roughly a factor of 10 smaller than the x - ray luminosity of the m33 nucleus , but given the uncertainty in the distance to ngc  4395 , and its slightly smaller total nuclear luminosity , it is conceivable that the x - ray luminosity of both the m33 and ngc  4395 result from similar mechanisms .",
    "however , the reported x - ray variability occurs on timescales significantly shorter than the 106-day x - ray variability reported for the m33 nucleus by dubus  ( 1997 ) .",
    "we have analyzed wfpc2 planetary camera broad - band imaging observations of the compact star cluster nuclei of four extreme late - type spiral galaxies : m33 , ngc  4395 , ngc  4242 , and eso  359 - 029 .",
    "all of these galaxies have diffuse , moderate - to - low surface brightness disks , low luminosities , little or no bulge component , and relatively weak central gravitational potentials .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  4395 is a previously known low - luminosity seyfert  1 ; m33 has some signs of possible weak activity , while the other two nuclei are not known to be active .",
    "however , we have confirmed that all four nuclei appear to be true compact star cluster nuclei rather than simply small nuclear  regions .",
    "all of the program nuclei are partially resolved with the planetary camera 2 .",
    "the radial brightness profiles in all four nuclei cases is well fit by a combination of an isothermal sphere ( is ) and a central point source ( psf ) component , which we refer to as the `` is+p '' model .",
    "physically this model implies that the structure of the nuclei may consist of an underlying star cluster with an abrupt change in luminosity density near the center .",
    "this gradient may be due to a power law cusp in the stellar density profile , such as those associated with core collapse ( e.g. , l98 ) , or could represent the presence of a point - like source such as an agn , a compact group of young stars , or a single supergiant star .",
    "the existence of an unresolved center in all of our program objects indicates that the luminosity densities in the centers of the nuclei are increasing to the resolution limit of our data .",
    "in the case of m33 , the is+p model provides an equally good fit to the data as the continuous ` nuker ' power law model of l98 .",
    "our choice of the simple is+p model is physically motivated by the presence of a compact central light concentration in the milky way s nuclear cluster ( seen superposed on a smoother nuclear star cluster background ) , and the inferred presence of agns _ within _ compact nuclear star clusters ( e.g. , norman & scoville 1988 ) .",
    "a central subcluster of young stars like that in the milky way s nucleus would be at most marginally resolved by wfpc2 at the distance of m33 , while an agn would be unresolved ( see blandford 1990 ) .",
    "the is+p model therefore is on a firm physical basis for the ngc  4395 nucleus , where the point source component represents an extremely compact agn .",
    "more complex models can provide equally good or slightly better fits to the observed nuclear brightness maps , but these have more free parameters and provide at most small improvements in the fit accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the more complex models could not be uniquely constrained and hence do not supply physically insightful information . while the is+p model is simplistic , it is also well - matched to the degree of resolution we can achieve for galaxy nuclei outside of the local group .",
    "we show that because of the effects of increasing distance , the core radii we derive for the underlying nuclear star clusters of our program galaxies are only upper limits .",
    "we estimate the severity of the effects of distance on our measurements by producing an artificial `` redshifted '' version of the m33 nucleus . from that experiment ,",
    "we conclude that the sizes of the compact star cluster components of all four of our program objects are similar to within a factor of 4 and all have core radii of less than 1.8  pc in the @xmath1 band .",
    "the luminosities of all four nuclei are similar ( @xmath1321 ) indicating that nuclei with similar luminosities can be either active or non - active . in spite of the modest range in optical luminosity ,",
    "we see a spread of 1.81 magnitudes in the @xmath5 colors of our program nuclei , with the active nucleus of ngc  4395 being by far the bluest .",
    "this spread in color may be indicative of different evolutionary phases ( e.g. , level of nuclear activity or recent star formation ) in otherwise structurally similar underlying nuclei .    in spite of their compact sizes , the nuclei in our sample exhibit complex structure .",
    "m33 has slightly elliptical isophotes and shows the presence of a jet - like feature .",
    "this jet - like feature may be a signature of low - level activity in the m33 nucleus .",
    "ngc  4395 is even more structurally complex , especially in the @xmath0 frame , where it appears as a point source superimposed on elongated , somewhat irregularly - shaped isophotes , possibly resulting from ionized gas emission .",
    "in addition , there is a bright arc very near the nucleus ( @xmath1333  pc ) which is likely due to [ ] emission , with @xmath134()@xmath135 .",
    "a larger filamentary structure is found along the same line of sight at @xmath13320  pc , and is also likely to be a highly ionized emission region .",
    "this pair of structures seems to be analogous to the `` ionization cones '' seen in more powerful agns .",
    "these features , in combination with the luminous blue point source our model fits reveal , lend further support to a standard agn model for the source of activity in the ngc  4395 nucleus ( see also filippenko  1993 ) .",
    "the similarity of the appearance of the ngc  4395 nucleus in the @xmath1 filter to the other nuclei in our sample suggests that it is a fairly normal star cluster nucleus which happens to be presently hosting activity .",
    "stellar velocity dispersion measurements will help to confirm or refute this picture .",
    "ngc  4242 is the only one of the four program nuclei that appears more structurally complex in the @xmath1 frame than in the blue image .",
    "our is+p model fits uncover an elongated bar - shaped residual structure at the center of this nucleus .",
    "eso  359 - 029 appears relatively symmetric in our data , but this is the most poorly resolved of our program nuclei .",
    "for the three nuclei for which we have @xmath0 data , we measure an is model component core radii that are roughly twice as large in the @xmath1 band as in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the blue luminosity therefore appears to be centrally concentrated , a symptom that could result from a variety of processes . as in the milky way",
    "s central star cluster , the star clusters in our program objects appear to have outlying populations of old or intermediate - age red stars , and a larger mixture of stellar ages in their centers .",
    "the presence of miniature agns could also produce this trend , as would an excess population of ` blue straggler ' stars which could form via stellar mergers within dense nuclei ( km ; l98 ) .",
    "various factors make the origin of compact star cluster nuclei in small spiral galaxies enigmatic .",
    "our new observations confirm that even when viewed at very high angular resolutions , all four of our program galaxies appear to be `` naked''that is they exist in extremely diffuse circumnuclear environments with a low - density surrounding stellar disk , no spiral arms or significant bulge , few regions of enhanced star formation , and little indication of dust .",
    "these environments are in stark contrast to those typical of brighter compact nuclei and more powerful agns .",
    "in addition , the central gravitational potentials of the host galaxies of our program nuclei appear to be very shallow .",
    "thus it remains unclear how dense , compact collections of material formed at their centers .",
    "furthermore , the morphologies of the host galaxies argue against their having been victims of major interactions ( matthews & gallagher 1997 ) , and their low central densities mitigate against dynamical friction being efficient enough for a star cluster formed elsewhere to migrate to the galaxy center .",

    "<S> we have used the wide field and planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ to obtain @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2- and @xmath3-band ) observations of the compact star cluster nuclei of the nearby , late - type , low - luminosity spiral galaxies ngc  4395 , ngc  4242 , and eso  359 - 029 . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze archival wfpc2 observations of the compact star cluster nucleus of m33 . </S>",
    "<S> all of these galaxies are structurally diffuse , with moderately low surface brightnesses and little or no discernible bulge component . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a comparative analysis of the structural and photometric properties of their nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  4395 contains a seyfert  1 nucleus ; m33 has some signatures of weak nuclear activity ; the other two galaxies are not known to be active . </S>",
    "<S> all of the nuclei have @xmath4 , hence these represent a little explored low - luminosity extension of the galactic nuclear activity sequence in a class of host galaxy not traditionally associated with galactic nuclear phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> these kinds of compact nuclei appear to be quite common in low luminosity , late - type spirals .    </S>",
    "<S> our planetary camera 2 images partially resolve the nuclei of all four galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> a simple model consisting of an isothermal sphere plus a point source provides a good model for the observed radial intensity distribution in all cases and permits an exploration of the underlying nuclear structures and spatial scales . despite their low luminosities , all of the nuclei are very compact . in all cases the luminosity densities are increasing to the resolution limit of our data at small radii . in spite of having similar size scales and luminosities , the nuclei in our sample span a wide range of @xmath5 color </S>",
    "<S> this may be a signature of different evolutionary phases in structurally similar nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> the m33 nucleus exhibits complex structure ; its isophotes are elongated , and it has a jet - like component . </S>",
    "<S> the seyfert nucleus of ngc  4395 has an extremely blue color ( @xmath60.16 ) and is the most structurally complex nucleus in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> circularly symmetric fits to its underlying structure reveal a distinct bipolar pattern . </S>",
    "<S> a pair of bright filaments located on one side of the nucleus are probably due to [ ] emission from gas within a nuclear ionization cone . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  4395 appears to contain an underlying normal star cluster nucleus that is hosting activity .    </S>",
    "<S> ngc  4242 shows evidence of a slightly elongated , bar - shaped feature at its center . </S>",
    "<S> the eso  359 - 029 nucleus appears relatively symmetric and featureless at the resolution limit of our data , but it is clearly very compact .    </S>",
    "<S> the circumnuclear environments of all four of our program galaxies are extremely diffuse , have only low to moderate star formation , and appear to be devoid of large quantities of dust . </S>",
    "<S> the central gravitational potentials of the galaxies are also quite shallow , making the origin of these types of `` naked '' nuclei problematic .    0.5 cm </S>"
