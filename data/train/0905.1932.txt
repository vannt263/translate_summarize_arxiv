    "the non - commutative geometry of a quasi - periodic tiling studies an appropriate @xmath0-algebra of a dynamical system @xmath3 , for a compact metric space @xmath4 , called _ the hull _ , endowed with a continuous lie group @xmath5 action .",
    "this @xmath0-algebra is of relevance to study the space of leaves which is pathological in any topological sense .",
    "the hull owns also a geometrical structure of _ lamination _ or _ foliated space _ ,",
    "the transverse structure being just metric @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-algebras and the non - commutative tools provide then topological and geometrical invariants for the tiling or the lamination . moreover",
    ", some @xmath1-theoretical invariants of euclidean tilings have a physical interpretation .",
    "in particular , when the tiling represents a quasi - crystal , the image of the @xmath1-theory under the canonical trace labels the gaps in the spectrum of the schrdinger operator associated with the quasi - crystal @xcite .    for an euclidean tiling , the group @xmath5 is @xmath6 and @xmath6-invariant ergodic probability measures on the hull are in one - to - one correspondence with ergodic transversal invariant measures and also with extremal traces on the @xmath0-algebra @xcite .",
    "these algebras are well studied and this leads , for instance , to give distinct proofs of the _ gap labelling conjecture _ @xcite , i.e. for minimal @xmath6-action , the image of the @xmath1-theory under a trace is the countable subgroup of @xmath7 generated by the images under the corresponding transversal invariant measure of the compact - open subsets of the ( cantor ) canonical transversal .    for a hyperbolic quasi - periodic tiling ,",
    "the situation is quite distinct .",
    "the group of affine transformations acts on the hull and since this group is not unimodular , there is no transversally invariant measure @xcite .",
    "a new phenomena shows up for the @xmath0-algebra of the tiling : it has no trace .",
    "nevertheless , the affine group is amenable , so the hull admits at least one invariant probability measure .",
    "these measures are actually in one - to - one correspondence with harmonic currents @xcite , and they provide @xmath2-cyclic cocycles on the smooth algebra of the tiling .    the present paper is devoted to give a complete description of the @xmath0-algebra and the @xmath1-theory of a specific family of hyperbolic tilings derivated from the example given by penrose in @xcite .",
    "the dynamic of the hulls under investigation , have a structure of double suspension ( this make sens in term of groupoids as we shall see in section [ subsec - groupoid - suspension ] ) which enables to make explicit computations .",
    "this suggests that the pairing with the @xmath2-cyclic cocycle is closely related to the one - dimension gap - labelling for a subshift associated with the tiling .",
    "but the right setting to state an analogue of the gap - labelling seems to be frechet algebras and a natural question is whether this bring in new computable invariants .",
    "background on tiling spaces is given in the next section and we construct examples of hyperbolic quasi - periodic tilings in the third section .",
    "a description of the considered hulls is given in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we recall the background on the groupoids and their @xmath0-algebras .",
    "sections 6 and 7 are devoted to the complete description of the @xmath0-algebras of the examples and their @xmath1-theory groups in terms of generetors are given in section @xmath8 . for readers interested in topological invariants of the hull ,",
    "we compute its @xmath1-theory and its cch cohomology and we relate these computations to the former one . in the last section we construct @xmath2-cyclic cocycles associated to these tilings and we discuss an odd version of the gap - labelling .",
    "let @xmath9 be the real hyperbolic @xmath10-space , identified with the upper half complex plane : @xmath11 with the metric @xmath12 .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the group of _ affine transformations _ of this space : i.e. the isometries of @xmath9 of the kind @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 reals and @xmath16 .",
    "a tiling @xmath17 of @xmath9 , is a collection of convex compact polygons @xmath18 with geodesic borders , called _",
    ", such that their union is the whole space @xmath9 , their interiors are pairwise disjoint and they meet full edge to full edge . for instance , when @xmath19 is a fundamental domain of a co - compact lattice @xmath20 of isometries of @xmath9 , then @xmath21 is a tiling of @xmath9 .",
    "however the set of tilings is much richer than the one given by lattices as we should see later on .",
    "similarly to the euclidian case , a tiling is said of @xmath5-_finite type _ or _ finite affine type _",
    ", if there exists a finite number of polygons @xmath22 called _ prototiles _ such that each @xmath18 is the image of one of these polygons by an element of @xmath5 . besides its famous euclidean tiling , penrose in @xcite constructs a finite affine type tiling made with a single prototile which is not stable for any fuchsian group .",
    "the construction goes as follows .",
    "let @xmath23 be the convex polygon with vertices @xmath24 with affix @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath23 is a polygon with @xmath29 geodesic edges .",
    "consider the two maps : @xmath30        the hyperbolic penrose s tiling is defined by @xmath31 ( see figure [ pentil ] ) .",
    "this is an example of finite affine type tiling of @xmath9 .",
    "this tiling is stable under no co - compact group of hyperbolic isometries .",
    "the proof is homological : we associate with the edge @xmath32 a positive charge and two negative charges with edges @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath35 was stable for a fuchsian group , then @xmath23 would tile a compact surface .",
    "since the edge @xmath32 can meet only the edges @xmath33 or @xmath34 , the surface has a neutral charge .",
    "this is in contradiction with the fact @xmath23 is negatively charged .",
    "g. margulis and s. mozes @xcite have generalized this construction to build a family of prototiles which can not be used to tile a compact surface .",
    "notice the group of isometries which preserves @xmath36 is not trivial and is generated by the transformation @xmath37 . in order to break this symmetry ,",
    "it is possible , by a standard way , to decorate prototiles to get a new finite affine type tiling which is stable under no non - trivial isometry ( we say in this case that the tiling is _ aperiodic _ ) .",
    "in this section , we recall some basic definitions and properties on dynamical systems associated with tilings . we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the proofs .",
    "we give then a description of the dynamical system associated to the hyperbolic penrose s tiling .",
    "first , note that the group @xmath5 acts transitively , freely ( without a fixed point ) and preserving the orientation of the surface @xmath9 , thus @xmath5 is a lie group homeomorphic to @xmath9 .",
    "the metric on @xmath9 gives a left multiplicative invariant metric on @xmath5 .",

    "we denote by @xmath42 the set of tilings which are image of @xmath40 by isometries in @xmath5 .",
    "the group @xmath5 acts on this set by the left action :    @xmath43    we equip @xmath42 with a metrizable topology , so that the action becomes continuous .",
    "a base of neighborhoods is defined as follows : two tilings are close one to the other if they agree , on a big ball of @xmath9 centered at the origin , up to an isometry in @xmath5 close to the identity .",

    "a tiling @xmath40 satisfies the repetitivity condition if for each patch @xmath23 , there exists a real @xmath55 such that every ball of @xmath9 with radius @xmath55 intersected with the tiling @xmath40 contains a translated by an element @xmath5 of the patch @xmath23 .",
    "this definition can be interpreted from a dynamical point of view ( for a proof see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamical system @xmath56 is minimal ( any orbit is dense ) if and only if the tiling @xmath40 satisfies the repetitivity condition .",
    "we call a tiling _ aperiodic _ if the action of @xmath5 on  is free : for all @xmath57 of @xmath5 and all tilings @xmath45 of   we have @xmath58 .",
    "as we have seen in the former section the hyperbolic penrose s tiling is not aperiodic , however , using this example , we shall construct in section [ exemple ] uncountably many examples of repetitive and aperiodic affine finite type tilings .",
    "when the tiling @xmath40 is aperiodic and repetitive , the hull  has also a geometric structure of a specific lamination called a @xmath5-_solenoid _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "locally at any point @xmath59 , there exists a _ vertical germ _ which is a cantor set included in , transverse to the local @xmath5-action and which is defined independently of the neighborhood of the point @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that  is locally homeomorphic to the cartesian product of a cantor set with an open subset ( called a _ slice _ ) of the lie group @xmath5 .",
    "the connected component of the slices that intersect is called a _ leaf _ and has a manifold structure .",
    "globally ,  is a disjoint union of uncountably many leaves , and it turns out that each leaf is a @xmath5-orbit . since the action is free , each leaf is homeomorphic to @xmath9 .    in the aperiodic case ,",
    "the @xmath5-action is _ expansive _ : there exists a positive real @xmath60 such that for every points @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the same vertical in , if @xmath63 for every @xmath64 , then @xmath65 .",
    "+ furthermore this action has locally constant return times : if an orbit ( or a leaf ) intersects two verticals @xmath66 and @xmath67 at points @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath64 , then for any point @xmath70 of @xmath66 close enough to @xmath68 , @xmath71 belongs to @xmath67 .      first recall the notion of suspension action for @xmath4 a compact metric space and @xmath72 a homeomorphim .",
