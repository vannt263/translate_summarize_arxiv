    "the determination of the primary cosmic ray chemical composition from extensive air showers ( eas ) observations is an open problem .",
    "various techniques based on different eas characteristics measured by different experiments including multi - component methods do not exhibit consistent results in estimation neither primary mass in the case of individual showers nor the mean mass composition at a certain energy .",
    "[ c][c][0.9]@xmath0   [ c][c][0.9]@xmath1   [ c][c][0.9]@xmath2   [ c][c][0.9]@xmath3   [ c][c][0.9]@xmath4 , gev [ c][c][0.9]@xmath5 , arbitrary units     one of the key eas quantities necessary for basic shower parameters reconstruction is the lateral distribution of charged particles at fixed observation depth . the exact form of lateral distribution function ( ldf ) is still uncertain .",
    "the majority of analytical parameterizations of ldf of different eas components is traditionally based on the well known nishimura - kamata - greizen ( nkg ) function  @xcite : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the particle density at radial distance @xmath8 from the core position in shower with primary energy @xmath9 and the age parameter  @xmath10 , @xmath11   total number of particles at the observation depth , @xmath12   shower scale radius , which does not depend on primary particle type and energy ( originally   the mliere unit ) .",
    "various modifications of nkg form , such as introducing an additional fixed or age - dependent scale coefficient or a local age parameter @xmath13 and also generalizations of the function by using third power - law term were suggested .    a different theoretically motivated approach ( _ scaling formalism _ )",
    "was proposed in our papers  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the observation depth .",
    "the scaling function @xmath16 can be described as follows : @xmath17 for electron densities we find @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22   root mean square radius of electrons : @xmath23 according to our calculations , the scaling formalism allows to reproduce electron ldf with 10% uncertainty for @xmath24  ev , @xmath25  g/@xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the last condition corresponds to the radial distance range from @xmath28  m to @xmath29  km depending on the shower age .",
    "this limitation makes scaling approach inadequate for shower size and core position estimation , but accurate enough for description of the shape of ldf measured by ground - based shower arrays far from the core .",
    "the method for mean primary mass deduction based on scaling formalism was developed in  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is its applicability to the experimental data of both compact and giant air shower arrays in wide primary energy range and also relatively weak sensitivity of the conclusions to variations of basic parameters of hadronic interaction model implemented in calculations .",
    "unfortunately , the shape of charged particle ldf measured experimentally is affected by the experimental method of shower classification .",
    "this effect can also be described in the framework of scaling formalism , but the variation of the root mean square radius compared with the data obtained theoretically for the fixed primary energy should be taken into account in case of relatively low primary energies , when shower selection is made by the total number of electrons , e.g. for example for kascade and moscow state university air shower arrays .    in this paper",
    "we examine thoroughly the influence of shower fluctuations on the shape of lateral distribution of electrons in eas of fixed size under the experimental conditions of kascade array in order to improve the reliability of mean primary mass deduction from the experimentally measured ldfs .",
    "we made simulations of extensive air showers initiated by protons and iron nuclei of vertical incidence assuming power - law differential energy spectrum of primaries with exponent @xmath30 , @xmath31 and also with sharp knee from @xmath32 to @xmath33 at @xmath34  gev .",
    "we used the semi - analytical code  @xcite with full monte - carlo treatment of hadronic part of cascade based on quark - gluon string model and analytical expressions of pure electromagnetic subshowers keeping all the basic sources of fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations of different eas components calculated by our code are in good agreement with corsika / qgsjet results .    according to  @xcite we simulated shower classification procedure used at kascade array and evaluated lateral distributions and root mean square radiuses of electrons in eight bins of shower size .",
    "the number of showers in each bin amounts from @xmath35 for lower energies ( @xmath36 ) to @xmath37 for higher energies ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the primary energy distributions in four from eight bins of shower size is shown in fig .",
