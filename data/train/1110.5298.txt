    "in 1983 thouless @xcite proposed a simple pumping mechanism to produce , even in the absence of an external bias , a quantized electron current through a quantum conductor by an appropriate time - dependent variation of the system parameters .",
    "experimental realizations of quantum pumps using quantum dots ( qds ) were already reported in the early 90 s @xcite .",
    "more recently , due to the technological advances in nano - lithography and control , such experiments have risen to a much higher sophistication level , making it possible to pump electron @xcite and spin @xcite currents through open nanoscale conductors , as well as through single and double qds @xcite .",
    "early theoretical investigations where devoted to the adiabatic pumping regime within the single - particle approximation @xcite .",
    "this is well justified for experiments with open qds , where interaction effects are believed to be weak @xcite and the typical pumping parameters are slow with respect the characteristic transport time - scales , such as the electron dwell time @xmath0 .",
    "this time - scale separation enormously simplifies the analysis of the two - time evolution of the system . within the adiabatic regime ,",
    "inelastic and dissipation @xcite effects of currents generated by quantum pumps were analyzed .",
    "furthermore , issues like counting statistics @xcite , memory effects @xcite , and generalizations of charge pumping to adiabatic quantum spin pumps were also proposed and studied @xcite .",
    "non - adiabatic pumping has been theoretically investigated within the single - particle picture , either by using keldysh non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) with an optimal parametrization of the carrier operators inspired by bosonization studies @xcite , or by a flouquet analysis of the @xmath1-matrix obtained from the scattering approach @xcite .",
    "while the first approach renders complicated integro - differential equations for the green s functions associated to the transport , the second one gives a set of coupled equations for the flouquet operator .",
    "it is worth to stress that , in both cases the single - particle picture is crucial to make the solution possible and it is well established that both methods are equivalent @xcite .",
    "several works have provided a quite satisfactory description of quantum pumping for weakly interacting systems . in contrast , the picture is not so clear for situations where interaction effects are important .",
    "different approximation schemes have been proposed to deal with pumping in the presence of interactions and to address charging effects , which are not accounted for in a mean - field approximation .",
    "typically , two limiting regimes have been studied , namely , the one of small pumping frequencies @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 ( adiabatic limit ) @xcite and the one of very high frequencies , @xmath4 ( sudden or diabatic limit ) @xcite .",
    "nonadiabatic pumping is mainly studied as a side effect of photon - assisted tunneling @xcite , where @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , it is quite cumbersome to calculate corrections to these limit cases .",
    "for instance , the analysis of higher - order corrections to the adiabatic approximation for the current gives neither simple nor insightful expressions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the theoretical interest , a comprehensive approach bridging the limits of @xmath4 and @xmath5 has also a strong experimental motivation : most current experimental realizations of quantum pumping deal with qds in the coulomb blockade regime and @xmath6 .",
    "this regime was recently approached ( from below ) by means of a diagrammatic real - time transport theory with a summation to all orders in @xmath2 @xcite . however , the derivation implied the weak tunnel coupling limit , whereas experiments @xcite typically rely on tunnel coupling variations which include both weak and strong coupling .    to address the above mentioned issues and to account for the different time scales",
    "involved it is natural to use a propagation method in the _ time domain _ @xcite . in this work",
    "we express the current operator in terms of density matrices in the heisenberg representation .",
    "we obtain the pumped current by truncating the resulting equations - of - motion for the many - body problem .",
    "the time - dependence is treated exactly by means of an auxiliary - mode expansion @xcite .",
    "this approach provides a quite amenable path to circumvent the usual difficulties of dealing with two - time green s functions @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been successfully applied to systems coupled to bosonic reservoirs @xcite and to the description of time - dependent electron - transport using generalized quantum master equations for the reduced density matrix @xcite .",
    "since the auxiliary - mode expansion is well controlled @xcite , the accuracy of our method is determined solely by the level of approximation used to treat the many - body problem .",
    "the formalism we put forward is illustrated by the study of the charge pumped through a qd in the coulomb - blockade regime by varying its resonance energy and couplings to the leads .",
    "the external drive is parametrized by a single pulse , whose duration and amplitude can be arbitrarily varied . by doing so , the formalism is capable to reproduce all known results of the adiabatic limit and to explore transient effects beyond this simple limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the resonant - level model , as well the theoretical framework employed in our analysis . in sec .  [ sec : prop ] we introduce the general propagation scheme , suitable to calculate the pumping current at the adiabatic regime and beyond it .",

    "the standard model to address electron transport through qds is the anderson interacting single - resonance model coupled to two reservoirs , one acting as a source and the other as a drain . despite its simplicity",
    ", the model provides a good description for coulomb - blockade qds and for qds at the kondo regime , where the electrons are strongly correlated . in this paper",
    "we address the coulomb - blockade regime , for qds whose typical line width @xmath7 is much smaller than the qd mean level spacing @xmath8 , justifying the use of the anderson single - resonance model .",

    "exactly as for the operator equations above we can use @xmath59 from eq .   and employ the wide - band limit for the current matrices defined in eq .  .",

    "the two - electron density matrix may be interpreted as the occupation of one quantum - dot level under the condition that the other one is occupied .",

    "the resonance energy favors an almost full occupation . for very slow",
    "pumping , large @xmath116 , the current @xmath106 depends only on the resonance energy @xmath14 : as the resonance dives into the fermi sea , the qd is loaded with charge and the process is reversed as @xmath14 starts increasing .",

    ", @xmath119 approaches the respective adiabatic value , while for @xmath160 the charge per pulse vanishes .",
    "moreover , one finds that @xmath119 is indeed positive for small pulse lengths .",
    "this has the intriguing consequence that the charge per pulse can change its sign sweeping from short to long pulses .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : appmonoqp]b for @xmath125 , where @xmath119 is negative in the adiabatic regime .",
    "a more general and quantitative analysis of this effect is certainly desirable , but beyond the scope of this article .",
    "it may lead , however , to interesting new applications .",
    "it is also worth to mention , that by changing the pumping parameters it is possible to optimize the charge pumped per pulse and in particular to find situations where @xmath161 , which may be very interesting for metrology purposes @xcite .",
    "we presented a new method to analyze non - adiabatic charge pumping through single - level quantum dots that takes into account coulomb interactions .",
    "the method is based on calculating the time evolution for single - electron density matrices .",
    "the many - body aspects of the problem are approximated by truncating the equations of motion one order beyond mean field .",
    "the novelty is the way the time evolution is treated : by means of an auxiliary - mode expansion , we obtain a propagation scheme that allows for dealing with arbitrary driving parameters , fast and slow . the method presented in this paper",
    "can be applied to a wide range of coupling parameters @xmath162 , provided one avoids the kondo regime .",
    "hence , we are not restricted to the weak coupling limit where @xmath119 , the charge pumped per pulse , is rather small .",
    "the presented results for single - pulses are also valid for pulse trains , provided the time between the pulses is sufficiently long .",
    "one can expect to find qualitatively new and interesting effects by decreasing the time lag .",
    "the propagation scheme allows , in principle , for studying transient effects .",
    "in addition , by propagating over a periodic sequence of pulses it constitutes a complementary approach to the more familiar periodic driving . in this regard , our propagation scheme has the potential to be a valuable tool and provide deeper insights into non - adiabatic quantum pumps .",
    "this work is supported in part by cnpq ( brazil ) .",
    "here we motivate the rules given in sect .  [",
    "sec : prop ] . to begin with we introduce correlation functions , which can be approximated by finite sums . then we write the current matrices in terms of these finite sums .",

    "we expand the fermi function @xmath166 as a finite sum over simple poles @xmath167 with @xmath168 and @xmath169 . instead of using the matsubara expansion @xcite , with poles",
    "@xmath170 , we use a partial fraction decomposition of the fermi function @xcite , which converges much faster than the standard matsubara expansion . in this case",
    "the poles @xmath171 are given by the eigenvalues @xmath172 of a @xmath173 matrix @xcite .",
    "the poles are arranged such that all poles @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) are in the upper ( lower ) complex plane .",
    "as in the matsubara expansion all poles have the same weight .    employing the expansion given by eq .  , one can evaluate the energy integrals by contour integration in the upper or lower complex plane depending on the sign of @xmath176 .",
    "thereby , the integral in eq .",
    "becomes a ( finite ) sum of the residues . for @xmath177 one gets    [ eq : corrfuncexp ] @xmath178    with the auxiliary modes for reservoir @xmath25 given by @xmath179+x_p/\\beta.\\ ] ] here , @xmath180 is the chemical potential and @xmath181 is due to the time - dependent single - particle energies @xmath182 of the reservoir hamiltonian [ eq.([eq : reshamilop ] ) ] .",

    "we can combine these two expressions to get for the second part of the current matrix    @xmath187    where we have used the definition of the correlation function @xmath188 given by eq .  . finally , by means of the expansion of the correlation functions we obtain an expansion of the current matrices    @xmath189    which resembles the last rule of eqs",
    "using the explicit expression for @xmath90 and taking the time derivative one can easily verify the first two rules given by eqs .  .",
