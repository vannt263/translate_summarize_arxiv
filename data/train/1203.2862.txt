    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is a planned gravitational wave observatory in the frequency range of 0.1mhz100mhz that consists of three spacecraft separated by 5 million km in a nearly equilateral triangle whose center follows the earth in a heliocentric orbit with an orbital phase offset of 20 degrees .",
    "gravitational waves will be detected as distance fluctuations between test masses moving along geodetic trajectories that are located in different spacecraft .",
    "lisa will require low power ultra - low noise photoreceivers for precision inter - spacecraft heterodyne laser interferometry .",
    "quadrant photoreceivers will be used to measure the test mass motion with a sensitivity of 8@xmath1 in angular orientation and 10@xmath2 in displacement over the frequency range of 0.1mhz100mhz@xcite .",
    "the laser beam at the transmitting spacecraft will have a diameter of approximately 40 cm and an output laser power at the telescope of the order of 1w .",
    "given the laser beam propagation over @xmath3 m and accounting for losses on the beam path , from the remote optical signal approximately 50pw will be detected on the entire quadrant photoreceiver .",
    "lisa will use heterodyne laser interferometry ( see figure  [ hetdetect ] ) for the inter - spacecraft displacement measurement .",
    "the incoming weak signal will optically interfere with a stronger local oscillator @xmath4 .",
    "the combined signal @xmath5 measured at the photoreceiver can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the frequency difference between the interfering laser beams ( heterodyne frequency ) , and @xmath8 is the interferometer phase containing the gravitational wave information .",
    "both ports of the beamsplitter will be measured by quadrant detectors .",
    "their combined information can also be used for common - mode rejection of laser amplitude noise .",
    "the main task of the photoreceiver development is to maintain nearly shot - noise limited performance over a measurement bandwidth from 220mhz@xcite .",
    "this frequency range is driven by the doppler induced frequency variations of the optical beat note signal due to the lisa constellation armlength changes , given by the orbits of each spacecraft .",
    "descriptive diagram of laser heterodyne interferometric detection . ]    the local oscillator power @xmath4 can be adjusted , according to the required photoreceiver performance . to reduce power consumption , temperature gradients at the optical bench due to hot spots at the photoreceivers , and to provide additional design margin",
    ", we aim for a low - noise wide - bandwidth photoreceiver development operating at low @xmath4 levels . using 0.5mw local oscillator optical power on the entire quadrant photoreceiver ( of the order of 100@xmath9w per quadrant ) , and assuming a responsivity @xmath10 of 0.7a / w for ingaas photodiodes at a laser wavelength of 1064 nm , the shot - noise @xmath11 can be computed as @xmath12 allocating @xmath13 of the shot - noise level @xmath14 to the input current noise contribution of a quadrant photoreceiver , and considering this is the quadrature sum of the current noise of the individual quadrants , we set an input current noise goal of @xmath15 for the single - quadrant photoreceiver transimpedance amplifier ( tia ) .",
    "we have chosen a conventional dc - coupled tia topology with a single ultra - low noise / wide - bandwidth operational amplifier ( op - amp ) , as shown in figure  [ tia ] .",
    "topology and noise model of photoreceiver tia . ]      for the tia topology shown in figure  [ tia ] , two main input current noise sources have been identified in the electronics :    * johnson noise ( @xmath16 ) from feedback resistor @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the boltzmann s constant , and @xmath20 is the temperature ( in kelvin ) . *",
    "op - amp noise properties : the current @xmath21 and voltage @xmath22 noise properties of the op - amp contribute to the total tia input current noise .",
    "* * the op - amp current noise @xmath21 sums directly to the tia input . * * the op - amp voltage noise @xmath22 translates to current noise at the tia input @xmath23 over the input and feedback impedances as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the frequency , and @xmath26 is the total circuit capacitance @xmath27 including the photodiode capacitance @xmath28 , feedback impedance @xmath29 , op - amp common - mode input capacitance @xmath30 , and stray capacitances @xmath31 from the board , components and packaging .    the bandwidth @xmath32 of the photoreceiver can be estimated as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gain - bandwidth product of the operational amplifier .",
    "the total tia input current noise @xmath35 model can be expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the normalized tia transfer function , @xmath23 is a frequency dependent component of the input current noise ( see equation  [ i_tia ] ) , and @xmath38 is the quadrature sum of various contributors that can be approximated by neglecting their frequency dependency for modeling purposes .",
    "for example , the expected current noise @xmath38 in the photoreceiver shown in figure  [ tia ] , can be computed as @xmath39 where @xmath21 is the op - amp current noise , @xmath16 is the johnson noise of the feedback resistor @xmath17 ( see equation  [ i_j ] ) , and @xmath40 is the shot - noise from the photodiode dark current . it can be seen from equation  [ ct ] that the photodiode capacitance and the op - amp common - mode input capacitance are crucial factors in the total noise budget .",
    "the challenge for the photodiode manufacture lays in achieving a minimum capacitance per unit area while maintaining high responsivity and low leakage if reverse - biased . for the tia electronics ,",
    "it is necessary to identify an op - amp with minimal common - mode input capacitance , current and voltage noise , and a gain - bandwidth product large enough to maintain the required sensitivity over the required measurement bandwidth of 220mhz .",
    "under a small business innovation research ( sbir ) grant , the company discovery semiconductors has developed a large - area quadrant photodiode ( qpd ) of 1 mm diameter and a quadrant capacitance of 2.5pf when reverse - biased at 5v .",
    "a first fully integrated quadrant photoreceiver ( figure  [ ds_quad ] : qpd + tia electronics ) performs with an equivalent input current noise of less than 3.2pa/@xmath41 below 20mhz@xcite .",
    "the characteristics of this prototype quadrant photoreceiver are :    * diameter of 1 mm with a 20@xmath9 m inter - quadrant gap . * individual quadrant capacitance @xmath28=2.5pf when reverse - biased at 5v . *",
    "dark current : 140na when reverse - biased at 5v .",
    "* responsivity at 1064 nm : @xmath42a / w ( quantum efficiency of 0.8 ) .",
    "* tia characteristics : * * feedback impedance : @xmath43 , @xmath44 . * * op - amp ada4817 : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath30=1.4pf , @xmath47 .",
    "discovery semiconductors has been awarded a second stage grant to further develop quadrant photoreceivers .",
    "given the successful development of a large - area low - capacitance qpd in the first step , the next stage will be focused on the noise reduction of the electronics , e.g. by integrating op - amps with better noise properties and studying alternative tia topologies .",
    "we expect to receive additional devices with lower noise electronics at a later date .",
    "photograph of a prototype quadrant photoreceiver manufactured by discovery semiconductors . ]      working in parallel with discovery semiconductors to try to understand the noise and bandwidth trade - offs in more detail , we have identified the ultra - low noise / high - bandwidth op - amp el5135 from intersil@xcite with the following nominal noise properties :    @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath30=1pf , @xmath50 .    a significant reduction in the op - amp voltage noise together with the bandwidth enhancement ( given by the higher @xmath34 ) were the main factors considered for selecting the el5135 for laboratory prototype photoreceivers . despite the higher op - amp current noise @xmath21 of the el5135 compared to the ada4817 ( mentioned above )",
    ", the lower voltage noise @xmath22 of the el5135 enables us to achieve significantly better performance over the entire bandwidth from 220mhz .",
    "the penalty is somewhat higher noise at low frequencies . according to equation  [ i_noise ] , the term @xmath38 ( corresponding to the quadrature sum of various current noise contributions , including the op - amp current noise @xmath21 ) dominates at lower frequencies , while the frequency dependent term @xmath51 ( consisting of the op - amp voltage noise @xmath22 swing across the total equivalent tia impedance ) becomes the dominant noise contribution at higher frequencies .",
    "+ we have designed a tia with a feedback impedance @xmath52 , @xmath44 , and an expected bandwidth of 40mhz ( according to equation  [ bw ] ) .",
    "we have built two different prototype boards to test the noise properties of a tia with the el5135 op - amp :    * * gap500q photoreceiver board * : we have chosen the commercially available qpd gap500q from gpd optoelectronics@xcite with a diameter of 0.5 mm and a responsivity of approximately 0.7a / w ( quantum efficiency of 0.8 ) at 1064 nm . when reverse - biased at 5v , this device has a nominal quadrant capacitance @xmath28=2.0pf and a dark current of 2.0na , according to the manufacturer .",
    "the purpose of this investigation is to operate the tia electronics with a photodiode that approximates the per - quadrant capacitance and package parasitic capacitance of the larger area discovery semiconductors detector . *",
    "* mock - up tia board * : we have built a board for controlled noise investigations of the tia performance , shown in figure  [ mockup_tia ] .",
    "+ schematics of tia mock - up board for noise measurements and frequency response measurements . ]",
    "+ this board has two inputs : 1 .",
    "input 1 : an input capacitor ( 2.4pf ) of similar quadrant capacitance is used to replace the photodiode . for noise measurements",
    ", this input can be grounded while maintaining input 2 open .",
    "2 .   input 2 : this is used to measure the expected photoreceiver transfer function ( tf ) by injecting a signal ( maintaining input 1 open ) , and scaling it accordingly by the feedback gain ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the equivalent input current noise can be obtained , by dividing the output voltage noise by the scaled transfer function .",
    "the gap500q photodiode was reverse - biased with a battery power supply at 5v , and the op - amps in both circuits were driven with a power supply at @xmath545v .",
    "we operated the photoreceiver using only one quadrant of the gap500q qpd with the el5135 op - amp for the tia electronics .",
    "the photoreceiver output voltage noise @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath11 is the photocurrent shot - noise of the incident light , @xmath57 is the photoreceiver transfer function , and @xmath58 is the equivalent input current noise of the tia electronics .",
    "operating under dark conditions , the photoreceiver output voltage noise @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 by dividing equations  [ vn ]  and  [ vdn]@xcite , we obtain that the input current noise of the tia electronics can be computed as @xmath61 for equivalent input current noise measurements , we used a light - emitting diode ( led ) at a center wavelength of 1050nm(@xmath5450nm)@xcite as shot - noise - limited light source .",
    "we measured the gap500q photoreceiver output voltage noise with ( @xmath55 ) and without ( @xmath59 ) led light , operating at two different optical power levels of 90@xmath9w and 60@xmath9w that are representative for the expected nominal 100@xmath9w per quadrant .",
    "these measurements showed equivalent input current noise levels @xmath58 that did not scale with the dc optical power level ( 90@xmath9w and 60@xmath9w ) .",
    "this also shows that the measured current noise @xmath58 upon subtraction of the shot - noise contribution , is not dependent on the optical power , which is consistent with a shot - noise behavior of the light source .",
    "+ we also measured the output voltage noise and the transfer function ( @xmath57 ) of our mock - up tia board ( see figure  [ mockup_tia ] ) .",
    "analogous to equation  [ vdn ] , the input current noise can be computed by referring the output voltage noise ( upon subtraction in quadrature of the rf spectrum analyzer voltage noise floor ) to the input dividing by the transfer function .",
    "figure  [ noise_meas ] shows the noise measurements .",
    "input current noise measurements of photoreceiver prototypes .",
    "the dashed trace is the photoreceiver with one quadrant of the gap500q qpd and the el5135 op - amp tia .",
    "the solid trace is the mock - up test board ( see figure  [ mockup_tia ] ) .",
    "the dashed - dotted trace is the photoreceiver noise model for a tia design with an el5135 op - amp and a quadrant capacitance of 2.5pf ( equations  [ i_noise ] ) .",
    "the traces with crosses and circles show the corresponding photoreceiver noise models using parameter values obtained from a fit to the data .",
    "the dotted trace is the equivalent current noise floor of the rf spectrum analyzer used as measurement instrument , referred to the input by the tia transfer function .",
    "the thick solid traced is our tia input current noise goal of @xmath62 in the measurement band 2 - 20 mhz . ]",
    "the gap500q photoreceiver reaches a level of about @xmath62 up to @xmath6310mhz , increasing at higher frequencies .",
    "it exceeds the noise goal by approximately 20% ( @xmath64 ) at 20mhz .",
    "the mock - up tia circuit meets our noise goal over the entire bandwidth ( 2 - 20mhz ) , however , it shows noise in excess of the model . at lower frequencies the equivalent input noise",
    "is determined by excess current noise ( @xmath38 : assumed to have no frequency dependence , equation  [ it ] ) , while at higher frequencies , the increasing slope is dominated by the op - amp voltage noise swing across the total circuit capacitance ( @xmath51 : dependent on frequency , equation  [ i_tia ] ) .",
    "we run a set of measurements in order to determine some of the involved unknowns :    1 .",
    "op - amp voltage noise ( @xmath22 ) : we measured the op - amp voltage noise on a separate sample of the el5135 , by driving the op - amp as a voltage follower with grounded input . a low - noise 10x amplifier in series with the op - amp output was necessary for a voltage noise measurement above the spectrum analyzer noise floor .",
    "the voltage noise level measured was @xmath65 at 10mhz , which is significantly higher than the specified @xmath66 .",
    "2 .   photodiode and feedback capacitances ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) : using a lcr - bridge impedance measurement instrument , we measured the photodiode quadrant capacitance @xmath28 on a separate sample of the gap500q to be 3.2pf with a 5v reversed bias , which is higher than the nominal 2pf .",
    "we also measured the capacitor @xmath28 of the mock - up board and the feedback capacitor @xmath29 to be 2.2pf ( nominally 2.4pf ) and 0.1pf , respectively .",
    "these noise properties are higher than specified and may account for part of the excess noise . a direct measurement of the op - amp current noise @xmath21 , the op - amp input capacitance @xmath30 , and the stray capacitances @xmath67 of the circuit involve the development of dedicated electronic boards ( currently on - going ) for well - controlled measurements .",
    "these measurements will be conducted at a later stage .",
    "however , it is possible to obtain an estimate of these values by fitting them as parameters of the noise model ( equations  [ i_noise ]  and  [ it ] ) to the two measured data sets . the noise level difference ( offset ) in the data of the gap500q photoreceiver and the mock - up tia is an indicator of a significant excess current noise contribution , @xmath68 , present in the photo - measurement and not in the measurement of the mock - up tia .",
    "this can also be included into the fit by considering the following non - frequency dependent contributions @xmath38 ( equation  [ it ] ) for each case : @xmath69 the capacitance values @xmath70 and @xmath71 are assumed to be known from the lcr - bridge measurements .",
    "we also assume similar op - amp and board noise properties ( @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath72 ) for the two circuits . from the fit",
    ", we obtained an op - amp current noise of @xmath73 ( about 20% higher than nominal @xmath74 ) and a combined stray plus op - amp input capacitance @xmath75pf ( 1pf nominal @xmath30 ) .",
    "we also fit a common op - amp voltage noise for the two data sets to be @xmath76 , which is comparable ( within @xmath77 ) to the independent measurement ( @xmath78 ) , but about 25% higher than nominal ( @xmath66 ) .",

    "direct measurements of the op - amp voltage noise and the reverse - biased qpd quadrant capacitance evidenced noise levels higher than nominal , accounting for part of the excess noise at higher frequencies . by fitting the parameters of the noise model to the data , we obtained estimates for the combined stray plus op - amp input capacitance and the op - amp current noise @xmath21 , which was determined to be approximately 20% higher than nominal . significant excess current noise ( 50% of total )",
    "@xmath68 was determined between photoconductive ( gap500q photoreceiver ) and electronic ( mock - up tia ) noise measurements .",
    "additional testing is required to determine its origin .",
    "the measured photoreceiver performance is of the order of @xmath62 below 10mhz , increasing up to @xmath64 at 20mhz with a 3db bandwidth of 34mhz .",
    "however , the mock - up tia performs at a level of @xmath85 below 20mhz ( 10% higher than expected from the nominal model ) with a measured 3db bandwidth of 38mhz .",
    "this suggests a significantly better performance of a real photoreceiver with the current tia design , depending upon clarification and , if viable , mitigation of the excess current noise @xmath68 .",
