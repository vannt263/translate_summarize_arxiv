    "there is increasing interest in methodologies for drawing conclusions about the _ dynamics _ of a chemical reaction network based only on the _ network structure _ , i.e. , with limited or absent knowledge of the kinetics .",
    "early work in this direction is exemplified by @xcite , with more recent strands including discussions of monotonicity @xcite , and discussions of injectivity @xcite .",
    "although the reaction systems discussed in examples are often assumed to have mass action kinetics , an important feature of @xcite was that they described criteria which applied for more general chemical kinetics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend graph - theoretic results , which were developed in @xcite in the context of mass action kinetics , to the case of general chemical kinetics .",
    "these graph - theoretic criteria are more restrictive than the matrix - theoretic results in @xcite , but are more intuitive , and give rise to conditions which are less expensive computationally , and are often easy to check by hand .    * dynamical systems derived from chemical reaction networks . *",

    "arbitrary orderings can be chosen on the sets of substrates and reactions .",
    "further , @xmath5 is only defined up to an arbitrary re - signing of its columns , equivalent to a switching of the left and right hand sides of a reaction .",
    "it is trivial that all results here are independent of the orders chosen on substrates and reactions",
    ". we will also confirm below that they are independent of the signing of columns of @xmath5 .",
    "system  ( [ basic ] ) defines a dynamical system on the nonnegative orthant in @xmath7 . with the additional assumption that all substances may have some inflow ( which is allowed to be zero ) and some outflow",
    "which increases with concentration , we obtain the related system @xmath8 here @xmath9 is a nonnegative vector representing the inflows and the diagonal function @xmath10^t$ ] represents the outflows , and is assumed to satisfy @xmath11 for each @xmath12 .",
    "the system has jacobian @xmath13 where the @xmath14 matrix @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 , and the diagonal matrix @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 .",
    "it is notationally convenient to omit the explicit dependence on @xmath19 , and write @xmath20 .    * previous results on injectivity and the main result of this paper . * in @xcite and",
    "@xcite a reaction system was termed `` nonautocatalytic '' ( nac for short ) if @xmath5 and @xmath21 have opposite sign structures in the following sense : @xmath22 for all @xmath12 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "these conditions are naturally fulfilled provided that no substrate occurs on both sides of a reaction ( either with the same or with a changed stoichiometry ) .",
    "here we refer to systems where the above two conditions are fulfilled , as * n1c * reaction systems , in order to emphasise that the conditions only rule out _ one - step _ catalysis .",
    "note that the * n1c * condition is not very restrictive for realistic biochemical reaction networks : for example , all the enzymatic reactions considered in @xcite satisfy this condition .",
    "a square matrix @xmath25 is * sign nonsingular * if all matrices with the same sign pattern as @xmath25 are nonsingular @xcite . in @xcite it was shown that system  ( [ basicout ] ) is injective , and hence incapable of multiple equilibria , provided that the stoichiometric matrix @xmath5 is * strongly sign determined * ( * ssd * ) , i.e. , all square submatrices of @xmath5 are either sign nonsingular or singular .",
    "this led to a characterization of injectivity based entirely on a computation on the stoichiometric matrix .",
    "on the other hand , following theory developed in @xcite , a signed , labelled , bipartite multigraph termed the species - reaction graph or * sr graph * was constructed in @xcite and used to make claims about the nonexistence of multiple equilibria in systems of chemical reactions with mass - action kinetics .",
    "this time , rather than a matrix computation , a certain graph - theoretic condition , sometimes checkable by observation alone without the need for any computation , was shown to be sufficient to guarantee the absence of multiple equilibria . here",
    "we will combine these ideas , and in fact show that the graph - theoretic condition in @xcite suffices to guarantee the absence of multiple equilibria for * n1c * systems with arbitrary kinetics .",
    "we will define an sr graph for an arbitrary * n1c * reaction system solely via the stoichiometric matrix @xmath5 of the system .",
    "we will then present a condition on this graph which will be termed condition  ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ suff ] consider the sr graph @xmath27 of an * n1c * reaction system with stoichiometric matrix @xmath5 .",
    "assume that condition  ( @xmath26 ) is fulfilled .",
    "then @xmath5 is an ssd matrix .    as a consequence ,",
    "if condition  ( @xmath26 ) holds for the sr graph associated with an n1c reaction system , then system  ( [ basicout ] ) , i.e. the system with outflows , is injective , and hence incapable of multiple equilibria . along the way to proving theorem  [ suff ]",
    "we will prove several auxiliary results relating computations on matrices to computations on graphs .",
    "of these , corollary  [ sns2 ] is of independent interest .",
    "the sr graph , introduced in @xcite , is a bipartite graph with @xmath0 substrate vertices or * s - vertices * , @xmath1 reaction vertices or * r - vertices * , and an edge between s - vertex @xmath12 and r - vertex @xmath23 iff substrate @xmath12 participates in reaction @xmath23 . for an * n1c * reaction system",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between edges in the sr graph and nonzero entries in the stoichiometric matrix @xmath5 : clearly @xmath28 implies that substrate @xmath12 participates in reaction @xmath23 , and given the * n1c * condition it can participate on one side of the reaction only , giving one edge between s - vertex @xmath12 and r - vertex @xmath23 ( in the general case multiple edges are allowed ) . on the other hand ,",
    "given the * n1c * condition @xmath29 implies that substrate @xmath12 does not participate in reaction @xmath23 , and hence that there is no edge connecting s - vertex @xmath12 and r - vertex @xmath23 .",
    "in this paper , for convenience , we make slight modifications to the labelling of the sr graph in @xcite .",
    "an edge @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) will be taken to mean an edge between the @xmath12th s - vertex and the @xmath23th r - vertex .",
    "such an edge exists if and only if @xmath28 . rather than labelling edge @xmath30 with the complex label associated with substrate @xmath12 and reaction @xmath23",
    "as done in @xcite , we simply give it a sign , so that @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath5 is only defined upto an arbitrary signing its columns , the signing of edges in the sr graph is not unique .",
    "however , as we will show in lemma  [ resigning ] after developing some further ideas , all results here are independent of the choice of signing .",
    "whether labelled with the complex labels or signed , the important thing is that the sr graph contains information on whether substrates occur on the same side of a reaction or on opposite sides of a reaction .",
    "given the one - to - one correspondence @xmath34 when @xmath28 it is convenient to allow a slight abuse of notation and refer to @xmath35 as an edge in @xmath27 .",
