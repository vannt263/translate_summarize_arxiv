    "the two classes of pulsating high energy sources that are believed to host magnetars , the soft gamma repeaters , sgrs , and the anomalous x - ray pulsars , axps , share a number of properties ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they have fairly long spin periods in the @xmath8  s range , spin - down secularly with timescales @xmath9  yr , do not have a companion star and are in some cases associated to supernova remnants with ages @xmath10  yr .",
    "rotational energy losses are @xmath11 orders of magnitude too low to explain the persistent emission of these sources , which is typically @xmath12 erg / s .",
    "both axps and sgrs show periods of activity in which recurrent short bursts ( @xmath13  s ) are emitted , with peak luminosities in the @xmath14  erg / s range .",
    "the initial spikes of giant flares are second - long events of exceptionally high luminosity , 3 to 6 orders of magnitude larger than that of the brighest recurrent bursts .",
    "giant flares are rare , only three have been observed so far , and might well be specific to sgrs .",
    "given the highly super - eddington luminosities of recurrent bursts and , especially , giant flares , accretion power is not an option .",
    "the magnetar model envisages that sgrs and axps are powered by the release of energy from their extremely high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the model has been largely successful in interpreting the unique features of these sources . according to it , a twisted",
    ", mainly toroidal magnetic field characterizes the neutron star interior ( @xmath15  g ) , only partially threading the crust .",
    "the emerged ( mainly poloidal ) field makes up the neutron star magnetosphere , with dipole strenghts of @xmath16 few @xmath17  g , as required to generate spin - down at the observed rate @xcite .",
    "energy is fed to the neutron star magnetosphere through alfvn waves driven by local  crustquakes \" of various amplitude and producing recurrent bursts .",
    "giant flares may result from large - scale rearrangements of the core magnetic field or catastrophic instabilities in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "these events occur more rarely and lead to the sudden release of very large amounts of energy .",
    "most of this energy breaks out of the magnetosphere in the form of a fireball of plasma expanding at relativistic speeds and giving rise to the initial spike of giant flares .",
    "the oscillating tail that follows this spike , displaying up to @xmath18 cycles of the neutron star spin , is interpreted as due to that part of the flare energy that remains trapped in the magnetosphere .",
    "the total energy released in this tail ( @xmath19  erg in all three events detected so far ) provides an independent estimate of @xmath20  g for the external field of magnetars @xcite .",
    "the 2004 december 27 giant flare from sgr1806 - 20 provides a new estimate of the internal field of magnetars . about @xmath21",
    "erg were released in the @xmath22  s long main spike of this event @xcite _ i.e. _ a two decade higher energy than that of the other giant flares observed so far , the 1979 march 5 event from sgr 0526 - 66 @xcite and the 1998 august 27 event from sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite .",
    "only one such powerful flare has been recorded in about 30 yr of monitoring from the @xmath23 known magnetars in sgrs .",
    "the recurrence time in a single magnetar implied by this event is thus about @xmath24  yr ( if giant flares were emitted also by axps , this recurrence time would increase by a factor of @xmath25 , as the number of axps and sgrs in our galaxy is comparable ) . the realisation that powerful giant flares could be observed from distances of tens of mpc ( and thus might represent a sizeable fraction of the short gamma ray burst population ) motivated searches for 2004 dec 27-like events in the batse grb database @xcite .",
    "the upper limits on the recurrence time of powerful giant flares obtained in these studies range from @xmath26 to 600  yr per galaxy , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 to 20 times longer than the time inferred from the 2004 dec 27 event .",
    "a detailed discussion of the merits of these estimates is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "however , we note that a 2004 dec 27-like event in the galaxy could not be missed , whereas several systematic effects can reduce the chances of detection from large distances ( see e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) . rather than regarding the 2004 dec 27 event as statistically unlikely , one can evaluate the chances of a recurrence time of hundreds of years , given the occurrence of the 2004 dec 27 hyperflare .",
    "we estimate that , having observed a powerful giant flare in our galaxy in @xmath28  yr of observations , the bayesian probability that the galactic recurrence time is @xmath29  yr is @xmath30 , whereas the @xmath31 confidence upper limit is @xmath32  yr .",
    "these valeus are derived for a uniform prior and a ( conservative ) lower cutoff of @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath29  yr with probability @xmath34 and a @xmath31 confidence upper limit of @xmath35  yr . ] on the rate @xmath36 .",
    "we thus favor smaller values and assume in the following @xmath37  yr .    in a timescale of @xmath38  yr ( that we adopt for the sgr lifetime ) about 70 very powerful giant flares",
    "should be emitted which release a total energy of @xmath39  erg .",
    "we note that if the powerful giant flares emission were beamed in a fraction @xmath40 of the sky ( and thus the energy released in individual flares a factor of @xmath40 lower ) , the recurrence time would be a factor of @xmath40 shorter .",
    "therefore the total energy released by giant flares would remain the same . for this energy to originate in the magnetar s b - field ,",
    "this must be @xmath41  g. this value should be regarded as a _ lower limit _ on the initial internal field of a magnetar .",
    "firstly , not all the the magnetic energy is released through powerful giant flares .",
    "the magnetar model predicts a conspicuous neutrino luminosity , resulting from ambipolar diffusion , of @xmath42  erg  s@xmath7 , where @xmath43 is the magnetar age in units of @xmath44 yr @xcite . integrating over @xmath45 yields a neutrino energy output of @xmath46  erg . including this energy gives an internal magnetic field of @xmath47 g.",
    "secondly , ambipolar diffusion and magnetic dissipation are expected to take place at a faster rate for higher values of the field @xcite .",
    "therefore estimates of the b - field based on present day properties of sgrs ( age @xmath38  yr ) likely underestimate the value of their initial magnetic field .",
    "very strong internal b - fields are expected to be generated in a differentially rotating fast spinning neutron star , subject to vigorous neutrino - driven convection instants after its formation @xcite .",
    "if the initial spin period @xmath48 is in @xmath49  ms range ( comparable to the overturn time of convective cells ) , an efficient @xmath50 dynamo is powered by fluid helycal motions , which amplifies the field in a predominantly toroidal configuration with a coherence length comparable to the star size .",
    "differential rotation provides a very large free energy reservoir , @xmath51  erg , that can be converted into a magnetic field of up to @xmath52 g @xcite .",
    "however the efficiency of the amplification is likely limited by the dynamical influence ( backreaction ) of the field which opposes convective motions .",
    "this limitation could be circumvented , however , if smoothing of angular velocity gradients by magnetic stresses is very efficient on a timescale shorter than the initial neutrino cooling time ( which sets the timescale for convective instability to occur ) ; in this case , a field of several @xmath53 g can be generated in magnetars that are born with spin periods of a few milliseconds @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "unless powerful giant flares such as the 2004 december 27 event are much rarer than the rate implied by having already detected one of them , magnetars must possess internal fields of @xmath54  g or higher ( values up to @xmath55  g can not be ruled out ) .",
    "based on current models , fields of this order can be generated only if magnetars are born with spin periods of a few ms . in the following",
    "we explore the consequences of this for the generation of gravitational waves from newborn magnetars .",
    "we parametrize their ( internal ) toroidal field with @xmath56  g , ( external ) dipole field with @xmath57  g and initial spin period with @xmath58 .",
    "the possibility that fast - rotating , magnetically - distorted neutron stars are conspicuous sources of gravitational radiation has been discussed by several authors ( see e.g. the review by @xcite ) .",
    "the path towards a better understanding of the early evolution and gravitational radiation emission properties of such neutron stars was layed out by @xcite , who discussed also the possibility of detecting the gravitational radiation signal from a newborn , @xmath59  g neutron star in our galaxy .",
    "if this value for the internal field pertains to ordinary neutron stars , then such events might be expected at the galactic rate of neutron star formation , _",
    "i.e. _ once every several tens to hundreds of years ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the formation rate of magnetars is substantially lower than that ( see section 4 ) , making the chances of witnessing the birth of a galactic magnetar in the near future very slim . in the following",
    "we show that for the range of magnetic fields discussed in section 2 , newly born , millisecond spinning magnetars are conspicuous sources of gravitational radiation that might be detectable up to the distances of the virgo cluster .",
    "the anisotropic pressure from the toroidal b - field deforms a magnetar into a prolate shape , with ellipticity @xmath60 , where the brackets indicate a volume - average over the entire core @xcite . in general",
    ", the symmetry axis of the magnetically - induced deformation will not be coaligned with the rotation axis .",
    "hence , in the neutron star frame the angular velocity vector undergoes free precession with period @xmath61 around the ( magnetic ) symmetry axis , where @xmath62 is the spin period @xcite ( the rotationally - induced distortion is not relevant here , because it is always aligned with the instantaneous spin axis ) .",
    "as long as the axis of the magnetic distortion is not aligned with the spin axis , the star s rotation will cause a periodic variation of the mass quadrupole moment , in turn resulting in the emission of gravitational waves , gws , at twice the spin frequency of the star .",
    "a crucial issue is whether the misalignement of the magnetic axis can be maintained in spite of the damping of free precession caused by the star s internal viscosity . in a prolate ellipsoid",
    "the rotational energy is minimized when the moment of inertia along the axis of the `` frozen - in '' distortion , @xmath63 , is orthogonal to the spin axis @xcite .",
    "hence , viscous damping of precession drives a prolate neutron star towards a geometry that maximizes the time - varying mass quadrupole moment and , thus , gw emission .    as the power emitted in gws scales as @xmath64 , the gw signal , for a given internal b - field , depends critically on the initial spin period and its variation thereafter .",
    "the spin evolution of a newborn magnetar is determined by angular momentum losses from gws , electromagnetic dipole radiation and relativistic winds . according to @xcite",
    ", the latter mechanism depends critically on the value of the external dipole and is negligible except for fields @xmath65  g , a regime that we do not discuss here .",
    "we consider in the following the spin evolution of a newborn magnetar under the combined effects of gw and electromagnetic dipole radiation .",
    "when both mechanisms are taken into account , the magnetar angular velocity @xmath66 evolves according to @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the neutron star radius , @xmath71 the gravitational constant and @xmath72 the speed of light . from this equation , we derive a spin - down timescale of @xmath73 according to models of neutron star internal viscosity @xcite , orthogonalization of the magnetic axis is expected to take place in @xmath74 precession cycles @xcite .",
    "this translates into a timescale of @xmath75  d. the condition for the newly formed magnetar to become an orthogonal rotator before loosing most of its spin energy is @xmath76 if condition ( [ condition ] ) is met , the magnetar quickly becomes a maximally efficient gw emitter , while its spin period is still close to the initial one .",
    "the strain is @xmath77 where the distance @xmath78 is in units of the virgo cluster distance and the angle - averaged strain is that given by @xcite .",
    "we estimate the characteristic amplitude , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the number of cycles over which the signal is observed . using equation ( [ strain ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath81 under the conditions discussed above , strong gw losses are not quenched immediately after the magnetar birth but rather extend in time , typically from days to a few weeks , before fading away as a result of the star spin - down .    in order to assess the detectability of this gw signal we compute the optimal ( matched - filter ) signal - to - noise ratio @xmath82 by extending the formulae by @xcite and @xcite to include both the electromagnetic and gw torques . in the previous equation @xmath83 khz and @xmath84",
    "hz are the initial and final values of the frequency of the signal .",
    "@xmath85 is the fourier transform of the gw strain at the detector ( eq .",
    "( [ strain ] ) divided by @xmath86 in order to account for averaging over source sky position ) and @xmath87 the one - sided noise spectral density of the instrument . in the relevant frequency band",
    "500 hz - 2 khz we approximate @xmath87 according to the current baseline performance of advanced ligo : @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath85 using the stationary phase approximation ( see e.g. @xcite ) with angle - averaged amplitude and frequency derivative @xmath89 given by eqs .",
    "( [ strain ] ) and ( [ general ] ) , respectively .",
    "eq.([total ] ) yields the following estimate of the optimal signal - to - noise ratio : @xmath90^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath91 .",
    "the limit in which the electromagnetic torque dominates corresponds to @xmath92 ( see eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) ) . in this case , the first logarithmic term in eq .",
    "( [ soluzione ] ) is negligible and we recover the result by @xcite .",
    "[ gwsall ] shows lines of constant @xmath93 for a source at @xmath94 and selected values of the initial rotation period ( @xmath95 and 2.5  ms ) in the @xmath96 plane : gws from newborn magnetars can produce @xmath97 for @xmath98 g and @xmath99 g. this is the region of parameter space that offers the best prospects for detection as we now discuss .",
    "the optimal ( in the maximum likelihood sense ) detection statistic for long - lived signals is the so - called @xmath100-statistic @xcite ; its computation involves the correlation of the data stream with a discrete set of filters that probe the relevant space of unknown parameters : the sky position ( 2 parameters ) and 2 parameters that control the evolution of the gw phase ( see eq.([general ] ) ) .",
    "a very conservative upper - limit on the required number of filters involved in a search can be evaluated ignoring correlations among the parameters : @xmath101 filters @xcite are needed to cover the @xmath102 area of the virgo cluster for a coherent integration time @xmath103  s , and @xmath104 filters for the phase parameters , giving a total of @xmath105 templates . for this number of trials",
    ", we estimate that a signal with @xmath106 can be detected with 1% false alarm and 10% false dismissal ( if all the parameters of the signal were known the corresponding @xmath93 would be @xmath107 ) .",
    "of course the actual sensitivity limit of such a search is likely set by the available computational resources . in practice ,",
    "the search for gws from newborn magnetars is probably best carried out using a `` hierarchical search strategy '' where coherent and incoherent stages are alternated in order to achieve ( quasi-)optimal sensitivity at affordable computational costs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a trigger based on the detection of the newborn magnetar by other means ( e.g. the corresponding supernova ) could further reduce the region of parameter space that needs to be searched .",
    "in addition the sensitivity will increase with the operation of the network of gw detectors that is coming on line . in any case",
    "the search for this new class of signals represents a challenge that we are investigating in greater depth .",
    "we have shown that the energy liberated in the 2004 december 27 flare from sgr  1806 - 20 , together with the likely recurrence rate of these events , points to a magnetar internal field strength of @xmath54  g or greater .",
    "such a field is sufficient to induce a sizeable deformation of the star and is most likely generated in a differentially rotating , millisecond spinning magnetar instants after gravitational collapse .",
    "magnetars with these characteristics are thus expected to be very powerful sources of gravitational radiation during the first weeks of their life .",
    "prospects for revealing their gw signal depend critically on the birth rate of these objects .",
    "the three confirmed associations between an axp and a supernova remnant ( ages in the @xmath108  yr range ) implies a magnetar birth rate of @xmath109  yr@xmath7 in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the chances of revealing the signal from a newborn magnetar in our galaxy are thus very low .",
    "a rich cluster like virgo , containing @xmath110 2000 galaxies , is expected to give birth to magnetars at a rate of @xmath111 1 yr@xmath7 .",
    "a fraction of these magnetars might have sufficiently high toroidal fields that a detectable gw is produced . a slowly evolving periodic gw signal at @xmath112  khz , whose frequency halves over weeks ,",
    "would unambiguously reveal the early days of fast spinning magnetars .",
    "we conclude that newborn , fast spinning magnetars provide a class of gw emitters over virgo scale distances that might well be within reach for the forthcoming generation of gw detectors .",
