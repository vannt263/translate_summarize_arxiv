    "characterizing the non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum many - body systems is of central significance to both condensed - matter physics and quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "a quantitative understanding of non - equilibrium quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is , in particular , a fundamental prerequisite for uncovering and controlling quantum phases of matter @xcite , as well as for assessing the complexity of quantum annealing or adiabatic algorithms @xcite . unlike standard phase transitions which are driven by a change in temperature ,",
    "qpts are driven entirely by quantum fluctuations at zero temperature .",
    "they nevertheless share with their classical counterpart the generic feature of universality : in equilibrium , the critical properties of a system sufficiently close to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) depend only on a few relevant characteristics such as its symmetry and dimensionality , thus defining the universality class to which the corresponding ( continuous ) qpt belongs .",
    "the universality class is distinguished by a small set of critical exponents  for instance , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , describing the power - law divergence of the characteristic length scale and the vanishing of the characteristic energy scale , respectively @xcite . in a non - equilibrium scenario ,",
    "the system can be driven across a qcp _ dynamically _ , that is , through an explicit time - dependence of one or more control parameters in the underlying many - body hamiltonian .",
    "this naturally prompts a number of questions : to what extent can universal quantum scaling laws persist out of equilibrium and be solely specified in terms of the equilibrium phase diagram ?",
    "conversely , how does quantum criticality influence the ability of a system to relax back to equilibrium ?    historically , the first theoretical studies in these directions date back to the pioneering work by barouch and coworkers @xcite which led , in particular , to the discovery of `` non - ergodic '' behavior in the zero - temperature long - time magnetization of a driven xy spin chain @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the demand for quantitatively addressing the above broad questions has heightened under the impetus of experimental advances in manipulating ultracold atomic gases , which are enabling the unitary dynamics of many - body quantum systems to be explored with an unprecedented level of coherent control and isolation from the environment @xcite . as a result ,",

    "adiabatic _ dynamics near a qcp based on the _ kibble - zurek scaling _ ( kzs ) argument @xcite ( see also ref . for related independent work and ref .",
    "for a recent review ) .",
    "originally introduced in the context of classical ( finite - temperature ) phase transitions in cosmology @xcite , the kz argument rests on the basic intuition that , irrespective of how slowly a system is driven across a continuous phase transition , adiabaticity is necessarily lost in the thermodynamic limit due to the vanishing energy gap at the critical point .",
    "qualitatively , this determines typical time and length scales , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , that characterize the adiabatic - to - diabatic crossover and , since `` order '' can not be established on distances larger than @xmath3 , results in the formation of a domain structure and the generation of a _",
    "finite _ density of `` topological defects '' in the system .",
    "quantitatively , let the time - dependence in the quantum - mechanical hamiltonian @xmath4 be introduced through a control parameter @xmath5 , with @xmath6 corresponding to the crossing of an isolated qcp at time @xmath7 , which can be taken to be @xmath8 without loss of generality . if the system is initially ( @xmath9 ) in the ground state , its ability to adiabatically adjust to @xmath4 is determined by the condition that the typical time scale @xmath10 , which is set by the smallest energy gap @xmath11 . since ,",
    "as the qcp is approached , the latter vanishes as @xmath12 , adiabaticity is broken throughout an `` impulse region '' @xmath13 $ ] symmetrically located around the qcp , where the `` freeze - out '' time @xmath2 is determined by the condition @xmath14 . in the simplest case of a linear sweep across the qcp ( fig .",
    "1 , top ) , @xmath15 for a fixed rate @xmath16 , this yields @xmath17 and a typical gap @xmath18 .",
    "correspondingly , the typical correlation length @xmath19 also scales with the quench time @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath3 is the universal length scale near criticality , it determines the scaling of the final ( @xmath21 ) density of defects and , more generally , the _ total _ density of excitations , @xmath22 , created in the system .",
    "if @xmath23 denotes the spatial dimension , the kzs result then follows : @xmath24    the validity as well as the limitations of the above kzs have been carefully scrutinized in a number of settings . by now , the original kzs has been confirmed for a variety of models involving a regular isolated qcp @xcite , and extensions have been introduced for more general adiabatic dynamics , including repeated @xcite , non - linear @xcite , and optimal @xcite quench processes . in parallel , departures from the kzs predictions have emerged for more complex adiabatic scenarios , involving for instance quenches across either an isolated multicritical point ( mcp ) @xcite or non - isolated qcps ( that is , critical regions ) @xcite , as well as qpts in infinitely - coordinated @xcite , disordered @xcite , and/or spatially inhomogeneous systems@xcite . a main message that has emerged from the above studies",

    "this feature is vividly exemplified , for instance , in multicritical quantum quenches , whereby the asymmetry of the kz impulse region relative to the static qcp ( fig .",
    "1 , bottom ) causes a path - dependent minimum gap other than the critical gap to be relevant and an effective dynamical exponent @xmath25 to emerge @xcite .",
    "in addition to characterizing the response to an adiabatic probe , the opposite limit of a _ sudden _ change of the tuning parameter @xmath26 near a qcp has also attracted a growing attention recently , in connection with the study of both dynamical quantum - critical properties @xcite , as well as thermalization dynamics in closed quantum systems and its interplay with quantum integrability @xcite . in particular , for sudden quenches with a sufficiently _ small amplitude _ , the existence of universal scaling behavior has been established for various physical observables and qualitatively related to the above kz argument @xcite : by associating to a quench with amplitude @xmath27 the characteristic length scale @xmath28 , and by interpreting @xmath29 as the correlation length in the final state , one immediately infers that @xmath30 .        with a few exceptions where",

    "conceptually , elucidating to what extent and how universal scaling properties may depend upon the details of the system s initialization is needed to gain a more complete picture of non - equilibrium quantum - critical physics .",
    "while one might , for instance , naively expect that a sizable overlap with the initial ground state would be essential in determining the applicability of ground - state scaling results , a main highlight of our analysis is that the support of the initial state on those excitations relevant to the path - dependent excitation process is key in a dynamical scenario , in a sense to be made precise later .",
    "furthermore , from a practical standpoint , perfect initialization of a many - body hamiltonian in its exact ground state is both np - hard in general @xcite and experimentally unfeasible due to limited control . in this sense ,",
    "our investigation both extends previous studies on finite - temperature signatures of static qpts @xcite , and may be directly relevant to experiments using ultracold atoms @xcite as well as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) quantum simulators @xcite .    while our analysis focuses on the simplest yet paradigmatic case of an exactly solvable xy quantum spin chain ( sec .",

    "both pure and mixed initial states carrying finite excitation energy above the ground state are examined , under the main assumption that , subsequent to initialization , the system can be treated as ( nearly ) isolated , hence evolving under a time - dependent hamiltonian .",

    "the ground state and excited energy eigenstates with an odd number of fermions belong to the sector @xmath77 , which implies periodic boundary conditions on the fermions , @xmath78 , and a different set @xmath79 of allowed momentum modes , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
