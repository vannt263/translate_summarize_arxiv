    "a great difference with respect to the framework where the vafa - witten theorem has been demonstrated is the fact that there is no @xmath256-matrix for two - component dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions , hence the above lemma , which forced the fermionic determinant to be real and positive , does not apply .",
    "the fermionic determinant was actually calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for a single two - component fermion in two - dimensional space and indeed , it presents a complex phase .",
    "this is proportional to a chern - simons term , which is not invariant either under p or t , and the proportionality factor is fixed and non - vanishing . in this case the theorem clearly does not apply .",
    "the bound on the partition function just can not be fulfilled .",
    "now consider the case of many - flavor fermions .",
    "then , we have the product of all flavor determinants , which results in a real positive modulus plus an overall phase given by the sum of the complex phases of all flavors . for fermions of mass @xmath243 ,",
    "each phase is proportional to @xmath261 , namely , to the mass sign .",
    "this fact leads us to conclude , by using the same argument employed in the demonstration of the theorem , that the anomalous phases would cancel for an even number of flavors provided there is the same number of masses with opposite signs .",
    "this would make the resulting many - flavor determinant real and positive and would redeem the result of p and t invariance .    in our system ,",
    "specifically , we have just seen in the previous section that in the low - temperature phase the dynamically generated electron masses present two opposite signs : @xmath262 , hence the anomalous complex phases will cancel in compliance with the vafa - witten theorem .    the dynamical generation of masses and the associated occurrence of complex phases in the fermionic determinants , even though cancelling when fully summed , are responsible for the onset of a non - vanishing valley current below tc , which characterizes a quantum valley hall effect .",
    "this is the `` center - of - gravity '' of this work .",

    "<S> introduction. _ the experimental realization of graphene has opened the fascinating possibility of observing in a condensed matter system a number of interesting effects previously considered to occur exclusively in relativistic particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> the klein paradox @xcite and the zitterbewegung @xcite are well - known examples . </S>",
    "<S> graphene is also the first concrete realization of the dirac sea , the concept which has led dirac to predict the existence of antimatter . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> schwinger s effect of pair creation out of the vacuum by an electric field is expected to occur in this material , thus providing another beautiful connection between condensed matter and particle physics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene exhibits quite a few unconventional transport phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> these include an anomalous integer quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite and a puzzling finite ( `` minimal '' ) dc conductivity at half - filling @xcite , even in the absence of any dissipation and with a zero density of states . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical determination of the minimal dc conductivity and its dependence on interactions is still a challenge @xcite , in part due to the ambiguities associated to the @xmath1 limit in kubo s formula . </S>",
    "<S> attempts to include the effect of interactions in the calculation of the optical conductivity were recently made @xcite , however this effect disappears in the limit @xmath2 and therefore no corrections to @xmath3 due to the interactions can be obtained .    nevertheless , optical conductivity measurements @xcite yielded results that in the dc limit are in agreement with earlier theoretical calculations in the approximation of non - interacting electrons , namely @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , the integer qhe @xcite has been understood in terms of relativistic landau levels occupied by non - interacting electrons , similarly to the results for gaas @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the unexpected validity of the single - particle description has risen the issue of how relevant are the electronic interactions in graphene , leading to a vivid debate in the community . nonetheless , the recent measurement @xcite of the renormalization of the fermi velocity @xcite was an indication that interaction should be important . </S>",
    "<S> the direct measurement of the dc conductivity @xcite , which yielded a result that is in disagreement with the theoretical calculation in the absence of interactions , provided additional evidence for the relevance of these . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation of the fractional qhe in ultra - clean samples subject to a perpendicular magnetic field has closed the debate , undeniably demonstrating that the electronic interactions are indeed important , at least for a certain energy ( temperature ) scale @xcite .    another intriguing transport property that has been investigated in graphene is the possibility of observing a quantized transverse ( hall ) conductivity under unconventional circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> first , haldane has shown that the sufficient condition for the existence of the integer qhe is a broken time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) and not a net magnetic field , as was previously supposed @xcite . later , even more unexpected results emerged , such as the experimental observation of the integer qhe _ at _ _ room _ _ temperature _ @xcite and the proposal for the existence of a quantum _ spin _ hall effect in the presence of a sizable spin - orbit coupling in a system which preserves time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) @xcite .    most of the previous approaches , however , rely on a single - particle description and the role of interactions , as well as the proper theoretical framework to include them , has been often neglected or only partially included . from first principles , </S>",
    "<S> the relevant electronic interaction in graphene is the full electromagnetic interaction described by the minimal coupling of the electronic current to the u(1 ) electromagnetic gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , is not easily incorporated in the model because the electrons in graphene are confined to a plane and therefore require a 2d description , whereas the electromagnetic field is 3d . </S>",
    "<S> should we use maxwell electrodynamics in 2d for describing the interaction of the electrons in graphene , we would get a wrong result ( for instance the electrostatic potential would be @xmath5 instead of the correct @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solution for this problem consists in the use of a full 2d u(1 ) gauge field theory , which describes , within the 2d framework , the full physics contained in the 3d maxwell theory . </S>",
    "<S> such 2d theory was derived in @xcite in the static limit . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently a full dynamical derivation was provided @xcite and the theory was called pseudo quantum electrodynamics ( pqed ) ( in part because it envolves the so - called pseudo - differential operators ) @xcite .    in this letter , we employ pqed in order to describe the electronic interactions in graphene and explore some of the consequences of these . </S>",
    "<S> we firstly determine the corrections to the minimal dc - conductivity produced by such interactions , thus obtaining a value at @xmath7 , which is the closest to the measured experimental one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then evaluate the effects of pqed in the valley dc - conductivity and show that , below a temperature @xmath8 , it exhibits a nonzero transverse component , which is quantized in the same way as in the usual qhe . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is _ dynamically _ generated in graphene , when the _ full _ electromagnetic interaction is _ completely _ taken into account . in this case , we show that the individual valley contribution to the conductivity contains a p , t - violating transverse ( hall ) component , which has opposite sign for each valley and consequently leads to a quantum valley hall effect ( qvhe ) , rather than the usual qhe . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the schwinger - dyson equation for the electron self - energy in pqed and show that the latter satisfies a differential equation , which has solutions that shift the poles of the electron propagator to gapped energy states , when the interaction coupling is larger than a certain critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature scale is set by the gap : thermal activation will destroy the plateaus for temperatures larger than the gap .    </S>",
    "<S> all the phenomena described here only occur within an su(2 ) description of graphene , which is valid when there is no backscattering connecting the different valleys . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the use of pqed , contrary to other attempts to describe the electronic interactions in graphene , yields a current correlator that renders kubo s formula free from any ambiguities . in the last section , </S>",
    "<S> we show that our results are independent of the fact that the fermi velocity is different from the speed of light .    </S>",
    "<S> _ the _ _ model .  _ the @xmath9-electrons of the carbon atoms in the honeycomb lattice of graphene are usually described as 4-component massless dirac fermions , each component corresponding to the two sublattices ( a and b ) and the two inequivalent valleys ( k and k ) . if we neglect backscattering between the valleys , however , an equivalent description would consist of two massless 2-component dirac fermion fields . </S>",
    "<S> backscattering involves momenta of order @xmath10 , hence this process must be triggered by lattice displacements of order @xmath11 , which in the quantum version are phonons . in any description that does not consider phonon effects , actually one should , for consistency , neglect backscattering . </S>",

    "<S> we shall return to the physical value of the fermi velocity ; _ ii ) _ the gauge field propagator in momentum space contains the speed of light @xmath19 rather than @xmath20 , hence there will be no retardation effects due to the fact that @xmath22 _ iii ) _ the two valleys ( k and k ) are related by trs . in spite of the fact that we are using 2-component dirac spinors , however , we do not break trs _ </S>",

    "<S> the two - loops correction is exclusive of pqed and was calculated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a single massless fermion , yielding @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath33 , hence the perturbation expansion is justified .    </S>",
    "<S> _ the dc conductivity @xmath34. _ the dc conductivity can be derived , within the linear response regime , from kubo s formula , which for real time is : @xmath35    however , we must sum over the spin components and over the valleys k and k. the sum over spins just contributes a factor @xmath36 to @xmath23 . since the p , t - symmetries are preserved , the contributions from the two valleys are clearly identical and the conductivity reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the time - reversed correlator and , before summing on the valleys we are using @xmath39 ( see the supplemental material for more details ) . using eq.([pi ] ) and eq.([pi2 ] ) and taking the limits in eq.([kubo1 ] ) we get @xmath40 \\label{imp11}\\ ] ] and @xmath41    eq . ( [ imp11 ] ) displays the dc conductivity , which has the usual minimal value plus corrections due to the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the corrections above are to the _ dc conductivity _ </S>",
    "<S> , rather than to the optical conductivity @xmath42 usually found in the literature @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the value we find for the dc conductivity , namely @xmath43 @xmath44 is the closest to the experimental result extrapolated to zero temperature , @xmath45 @xmath44 @xcite .    _ quantum valley hall effect . </S>",
    "<S>  _ the average valley current is defined by @xmath46    we can therefore define a dc `` valley conductivity '' , through @xmath47 where @xmath38 is the time - reversed correlator and the sum over spins is assumed to have been done . </S>",

    "<S> the existence of a transverse valley conductivity characterizes the occurrence of a qvhe . </S>",

    "<S> the valley hall effect has been earlier predicted to occur in graphene systems subject to a staggered sublattice potential that breaks inversion symmetry @xcite , or to strained graphene , where according to recent experiments pseudomagnetic fields oppositely oriented in the valleys can be as large as 300 t @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a fractional valley hall effect was proposed to arise in artificial graphene systems , by fine tuning the short - range part of interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice that here no symmetry is broken a priori and no fine - tuning of model parameters are required to generate the qvhe . </S>",
