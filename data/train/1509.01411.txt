    "it is important to evaluate the properties of extra - solar planets such as temperature , mass , age , and atmospheric composition by detailed observations to understand a planetary system formation history as well as a variety of planets .",
    "more than 1900 exoplanets have been discovered up to now ( extrasolar planets encyclopedia http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/ ) .",
    "however , most of the exoplanets were found by using indirect methods such as doppler and transit methods . besides the fact that indirect methods are less effective for exoplanets located far from main stars , we still have limited information to characterize the properties of exoplanets using indirect methods . thus , spatially resolved direct imaging is important to characterize various exoplanet systems . in particular",
    "mid - infrared ( ir ) spectral ranges are rich in exoplanet atmospheric gas lines and crucial for the characterizations of the systems .",
    "we need to consider a very high contrast in the flux between a main star and its planets when we measure the images of exoplanets directly .",
    "for example , when we observe jupiter in the solar system from the outside , we have to overcome the contrast between the sun and jupiter which is @xmath4 in the visible light .",
    "on the other hand , the contrast in the mid - ir ( @xmath5 ) is much lower than that in the visible light .",
    "nevertheless we can not observe such an object from the ground in the mid - ir due to the effect of earth atmospheric absorption . hence coronagraphic observations with space telescopes",
    "are indispensable for direct imaging of exoplanets in the mid - ir .",
    "sci ( spica coronagraph instrument ) is one of the focal - plane instruments originally proposed for spica ( space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics ) , a next - generation infrared astronomical satellite project .",
    "we adopt a binary shaped pupil mask ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and its references ) , because the mask has a high tolerance against the satellite pointing error and its optical performance does not depend on the observed wavelength .",
    "it was confirmed from laboratory experiments that a contrast of @xmath3 in the visible light is obtained by using a lens optical system with the binary pupil mask @xcite .",
    "in addition , they established a production method of free - standing masks , and developed various types of masks designed for partially obscured pupils .",
    "we require a high - accuracy optical system to realize direct imaging of exoplanets , because coronagraph capabilities strongly depend on the wave - front error ( wfe ) of the optical system . for mid - ir observations in space",
    ", we have to cool the whole instrument to low temperatures in order to minimize the thermal radiation from a telescope and instruments .",
    "considering the necessity of a broad - band coverage of mid - ir wavelengths as well as cooling of an optical system , mirror optics is more appropriate than lens optics . in order to maintain optical alignment",
    "when we cool the optical system , the material of mirrors should be the same as that of the instrument structure , which realizes uniform thermal contraction of the whole optical system .",
    "hence we develop and evaluate an off - axis aluminum mirror optical system to satisfy the requirements as a coronagraph instrument with the binary pupil mask developed for sci .",
    "we fabricated the mirrors by ultra - precision machining , because aluminum is difficult to grind and polish with high surface quality due to its mechanical properties such as the low young s modulus .",
    "we measured the surfaces of the aluminum mirrors and estimated the wfes from the difference between the designed and the measured mirror surfaces to verify that the mirror optics satisfies the sci requirements .",
    "we then integrated the mirrors into the optical system with the binary pupil mask to evaluate the performance as a coronagraph . in the optical measurement ,",
    "we use a visible light ( he - ne ) laser , the wavelength of which is about 10 times shorter than the targeted observational wavelengths for sci and thus more sensitive to optical misalignment , if any , of the system",
    ". finally we evaluate the capability of the coronagraph at a wavelength of 5 @xmath2 m , the shortest wavelength to be covered with sci , based on our model calculation with the measured optical performance .",
    "we fabricated and tested 8 off - axis parabolic aluminum mirrors with two kinds of mirror surfaces as well as 1 flat aluminum mirror , all of which were made by crystal optics .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] summarizes the designed focal and off - axis lengths as well as the material details for the off - axis parabolic and flat aluminum mirrors .",
    "the mirrors in the top 3 rows have the same surface shapes but with different aluminum materials .",

    "figure  [ fig : os01 ] shows the configuration of the measurement system for the parabolic mirrors , where additional optics is incorporated with the surface figure accuracy of @xmath6/20 ( pv ) for each optical component .",
    "we use the collimator lens c1 ( effective diameter 50 mm , focal length 250 mm ) so that the in - coming light focuses on the focal point of the off - axis parabolic mirror .",
    "the off - axis parabolic mirror is mounted on the 5-axis ( x / y / z - shift and x / z - tilt ; see figure 1 ) optical adjustment stage .",
    "we place an auto - collimation flat mirror in front of the off - axis mirror to reflect the light back to the interferometer .        as a first step",
    ", we set a pinhole mask with a diameter of 1 mm at the designed focal position of the off - axis mirror .",
    "we adjusted the tilt angles of the off - axis mirror and the auto - collimation flat mirror , and alignment of the interferometer and c1 .",
    "then we performed shift adjustments of the off - axis mirror using the additional optics with a shack - hartmann sensor .",
    "this sensor consists of a micro lens array ( lens pitch 300 @xmath2 m , focal length 18.8 mm ) and a ccd camera ( 570 @xmath7 570 pixels with the pixel scale 4.4 @xmath2m / pixel ) .",
    "the collimator lenses , c2 ( effective diameter 50 mm , focal length 150 mm ) and c3 ( effective diameter 10 mm , focal length 20 mm ) , are used to adjust the beam diameter . with the shack - hartmann sensor , we coarsely adjusted the alignment of the off - axis mirror to the wfe of accuracy @xmath8 @xmath2 m ( rms ) which was estimated by the image distortions on the ccd camera",
    ". then we performed a finer adjustment of the off - axis mirror alignment based on a fringe pattern with a fizeau interferometer with the accuracy of the x tilt @xmath91 arcmin , the z tilt @xmath920 arcsec , and the x , y , and z shifts @xmath93 @xmath2 m which are the resolutions of the optical adjustment stage .",
    "we obtained the surface figure errors of the mirrors from fringe patterns with the fizeau interferometer .",
    "the wfe ( i.e. , twice the surface figure error ) maps of all the mirrors are shown in figure  [ fig : os03 ] .",
    "for the off - axis mirrors in the top 3 rows in table  [ tbl-1 ] , we could not measure the whole square areas of 50 @xmath7 50 mm@xmath10 but circular areas of 42 mm in diameter , because the aperture of the interferometer fizeau lens is obscured by the fore optics , which limits the measurable areas .",
    "as for the other off - axis mirrors , we measured the whole square areas of 50 @xmath7 50 mm@xmath10 .",
    "for the flat mirror , we could not measure the edges of the square of 50 @xmath7 50 mm@xmath10 with the 60-mm - diameter flat fizeau lens .",
    "as explained later , only the central portion of each mirror is important for a coronagraph demonstration experiment , and therefore the coverage of the whole area is not necessary for that purpose .    it should be noted that the errors measured with the interferometer include not only the surface figure errors but also optical alignment errors ; the latter might be significant for the off - axis mirror measurements .",
    "we therefore calculated the wfes of the measurement system for the off - axis parabolic mirrors using the ray - tracing software zemax and estimated the sensitivity of the alignment errors . to simplify the calculation we consider that alignment errors are caused by the resolution of the 5-axis optical adjustment stage .",
    "thus there are 32 combinations of alignment errors of both plus and minus directions for each axis .",
    "we below choose the worst case as a possible contribution of the alignment error to the off - axis mirror measurement .",
    "figure  [ fig : os02 ] shows the whole optics for the coronagraph demonstration experiment , configured on the optical bench ( 700 @xmath7 730 mm@xmath10 ) for the sci testbed , pinoco @xcite .",
    "we integrated six off - axis parabolic mirrors and a flat mirror with adjustable mirror holders into the optical system .",
    "we selected the mirrors , based on the result of the wfe measurement , i.e. , mirrors with smaller wfes regardless of the aluminum properties , on the surface because we did not observe any systematic difference in the surface figure error between the different materials .",
    "from the bottom on the left - hand side in figure  [ fig : os02 ] , we input the he - ne laser through a spatial filter . on the top left - hand side , we set a ccd camera ( bj-40l , bitran ) of 772 @xmath7 580 pixels with the pixel size of 5.4 @xmath2m / pixel .    at position ( a ) in figure",
    "[ fig : os02 ] , the first focal point , a pinhole of 0.4 mm in diameter is placed to remove the scatter light from the fore optics . at position ( b ) , the first pupil , either a coronagraph mask or a circular aperture mask is placed to control the point spread function ( psf ) . as a coronagraph mask",
    ", we use a free standing checker board mask made of copper with the following specifications : the contrast of 10@xmath11 , the inner working angle ( iwa ) and the outer working angle ( owa ) of 5.4 and 50 @xmath12 , respectively , the optical throughput of @xmath130.34 , and the aperture size of 10 @xmath7 10 mm@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the diameter of the circular aperture is set to be 14 mm , which is the same as the diameter of the outer circular envelope of the coronagraph mask . at position ( c ) , the second focal point , a focal plane mask is placed to reduce the central intensity of the psf , which is constructed by two crossed blades with 0.1 mm thickness for each . at position ( d ) , the second pupil , three nd filters of 10@xmath14 attenuation per filter are placed to reduce the total intensity of the beam , which are tilted by  5 degrees with respect to the optical axis for stray - light rejection . finally at position ( e ) , the third focal point , the cooled ccd camera is placed on the focus adjustment stage .",
    "we first measured the psf image of the optics with the circular aperture . to derive the whole psf",
    ", we took 20 short - exposure ( 0.01 s ) frames and 20 long - exposure ( 30 s ) frames .",
    "the former is to measure the intensity of the psf center , while the latter is to measure the intensity of the psf skirts . for a half of the latter measurement",
    ", we placed the focal plane mask at position ( c ) in figure  [ fig : os02 ] .",
    "we then measured the psf image of the optics with the coronagraph mask . because the optical throughput of the coronagraph mask is lower than that of the circular aperture , we used longer exposure times , 0.04 s and 60 s , for the short - exposure and long - exposure frame measurements , respectively . except for the difference in the exposure time ,",
    "measurement procedures for the psf with the coronagraph mask are the same as those for the psf with the circular aperture .",
    "hence we took six kinds of datasets , three with the circular aperture and three with the coronagraph mask , each three consisting of short exposure and long exposure without the focal plane mask and long exposure with the focal plane mask .",
    "below we use the averaged image for each dataset and estimate intensity errors from the standard deviation .",
    "figure  [ fig : os03 ] shows the wfe maps of all the aluminum mirrors fabricated and measured in the present study . as mentioned above , for the top 6 off - axis mirrors and the flat mirror , outer circular boundaries are limited by the aperture of the measurement optics , while the whole areas of 50 @xmath7 50 mm@xmath10 are measured for the other 2 off - axis mirrors although they show data losses due to poor surface quality at the edges .",
    "the overall wfe distributions of the off - axis parabolic mirrors are apparently dominated by astigmatism .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] summarizes the wfe values of all the mirrors .",
    "the standard deviations are obtained by multiple wfe measurements .",
    "it should be noted that the wfes include not only the surface figure errors themselves but also the optical alignment errors in the measurement system , especially those for the off - axis mirrors .",
