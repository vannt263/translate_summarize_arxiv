    "the blazar markarian 421 has been the first extragalactic source observed at gamma ray energy e@xmath0500 gev @xcite .",
    "it belongs to the radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) sub class of bl lacertae objects , characterized by a non thermal spectrum extending up to high energies and by a rapid flux variability at nearly all wavelenghts .",
    "to date about 30 bl lacs have been detected at very high energies ( vhe , e@xmath0100 gev ) and mrk421 is the closest one ( z = 0.031 ) .",
    "its relatively small distance makes it one of the best studied tev gamma ray sources . since its discovery this object played a significant role in the discussion concerning both the emission processes in agns and the attenuation of tev gamma rays in the extragalactic space .",
    "it is now widely recognised that the bl lac radiation originates in a relativistic jet pointing at a small angle to the line of sight and that it is amplified by relativistic effects , explaining both the strong high energy emission and its rapid variability .",
    "usually the bl lacs energy density spectra have two broad band components , the first one peaking in the infrared to x - ray region , the second one in the mev - tev range @xcite .",
    "mrk421 is classified as a high - energy peaked bl lac ( hbl ) , showing the peaks in the x - ray and vhe regions , respectively @xcite .",
    "the low energy component is commonly believed to originate as synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons gyrating in the magnetic field of the jet plasma , while the origin of the second one is still unclear .",
    "many models propose that gamma rays are produced in inverse compton scattering of synchrotron ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc ) or ambient photons ( external compton , ec ) off the same electron population that produces the synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in the `` hadronic '' models , gamma rays are emitted as sychrotron radiation of extremely energetic protons , or by secondary particles produced by protons interacting with some target material @xcite .    flaring activity of mrk421 at vhe energies has been observed with variability time scales ranging from minutes to months , and many multiwavelength campaigns have revealed a strong correlation of gamma rays with x - rays , that can be easily interpreted in terms of the ssc model @xcite .",
    "in addition some data have shown significant variations of the tev spectrum slope during different activity phases , and an evident correlation between the spectral hardness and the flux intensity @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous observation at different wavelengths is of great importance since may provide unique information about the source properties and the radiation processes .",
    "a set of measurements @xcite covering 12 decades of energy , from optical to tev gamma rays , was performed during the strong flaring activity in the first half of june 2008 by different detectors : webt ( optical r - band ) , uvot ( uv ) , rxte / asm ( soft x - rays ) , swift ( soft and hard x - rays ) , agile ( hard x - rays and gamma rays ) and the cherenkov telescopes veritas and magic ( vhe gamma rays ) .",
    "these data allowed for a deep analysis of the broad band energy spectrum as well as for the study of time correlations among the fluxes in different energy ranges .    in this period two flaring episodes were reported , the first one on june 4 - 8 , observed from optical to tev gamma rays , the second one , larger and harder , on june 10 - 14 , observed from optical to 100 mev gamma rays . using the multifrequency data , donnarumma et al .",
    "( 2009 ) derived the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for june 6 , that shows the typical two humps shape . in the framework of the ssc model , according to the authors , the second hump intensity , that reached a flux of about 3 @xmath2 10@xmath3 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 at energies e @xmath0400 gev ( i.e. about 3.5 times the crab nebula emission in the same energy range ) seems to indicate that the variability is due to the hardening / softening of the electron spectrum , and not to the increase / decrease of the electron density .",
    "their model predicts for the second flare the inverse compton hump slightly shifted towards higher energies and a vhe flux a factor @xmath72 larger with respect to the first one .    unfortunately there were no vhe data included in their multiwavelength analysis after june 8 because the moonlight hampered the cherenkov telescopes measurements .",
    "the vhe observation was actually made for such a very important flaring episode by the argo - ybj experiment .",

    "we present our observation of mrk421 in flaring state during 2008 . after a summary of the data collected during the most active phase ( february - june ) , we focus our discussion on the results obtained for the june flares in the framework of the donnarumma et al .",
    "( 2009 ) findings .",
    "the argo - ybj detector is constituted by a central carpet @xmath974@xmath2 78 m@xmath10 , made of a single layer of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) with @xmath992@xmath11 of active area , sorrounded by a partially instrumented ( @xmath920@xmath11 ) area up to @xmath9100@xmath2110 m@xmath10 .",
    "the apparatus has a modular structure , the basic data acquisition element being a cluster ( 5.7@xmath27.6 m@xmath10 ) , made of 12 rpcs ( 2.8@xmath21.25 m@xmath10 ) .",
    "each chamber is read by 80 strips of 6.75@xmath261.8 cm@xmath10 ( the spatial pixels ) , logically organized in 10 independent pads of 55.6@xmath261.8 cm@xmath10 which are individually acquired and represent the time pixels of the detector .",
    "the full detector is made of 153 clusters for a total active surface of @xmath96600 m@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "argo - ybj operates in two independent acquisition modes : the _ shower mode _ and the _ scaler mode _ @xcite . in the following we refer to the data recorded in shower mode",
    "a simple , yet powerful , electronic logic has been implemented to build an inclusive trigger @xcite . this logic is based on a time correlation between the pad signals depending on their relative distance . in this way , all the shower events giving a number of fired pads n@xmath13 n@xmath14 in the central carpet in a time window of 420 ns generate the trigger .",
    "this trigger can work with high efficiency down to n@xmath14=20 , keeping negligible the rate of random coincidences .",
    "the time of each fired pad in a window of 2 @xmath15sec around the trigger time and its location are recorded and used to reconstruct the position of the shower core and the arrival direction of the primary particle @xcite . in order to perform the time calibration of the 18360 pads ,",
    "a software method has been developed @xcite .",
    "the detector is in stable data taking with the trigger condition n@xmath14=20 and a duty cycle @xmath16 .",
    "the trigger rate is @xmath93.6 khz with a dead time of 4@xmath11 .",
    "the angular resolution and the pointing accuracy of the detector have been evaluated by using the moon shadow , i.e. the deficit of cosmic rays in the moon direction .",
    "the shape of the shadow provides a measurement of the detector point spread function ( psf ) , and its position allows the individuation of possible pointing biases .",
    "argo - ybj observes the moon shadow with a sensitivity of about 10 standard deviations per month for events with a multiplicity n@xmath1740 and zenith angle @xmath1850@xmath8 , corresponding to a proton median energy e@xmath191.8 tev @xcite .    according to the moon shadow data ,",
    "the psf of the detector is gaussian for n@xmath20100 , while for lower multiplicities it can be described with an additional gaussian , which contributes for about 20% . when the psf is a gaussian with r.m.s .",
    "@xmath21 , the opening angle @xmath22 containing @xmath971.5@xmath11 of the events maximizes the signal to background ratio for a point source with a uniform background , and is equal to 1.58 @xmath21 .",
    "the semi - aperture @xmath22 is found to be 2.59@xmath23 0.16@xmath8 , 1.30@xmath23 0.14@xmath8 and 1.04@xmath23 0.12@xmath8 for n@xmath2440 , 100 and 300 , respectively , in agreement with expectations from monte carlo simulations .",
    "this measured angular resolution refers to cosmic ray - induced air showers .",
    "the angular resolution for @xmath25-induced events has been evaluated by simulations and results smaller by @xmath930 - 40@xmath11 , depending on n@xmath26 , due to the better defined time profile of the showers .",
    "the relation between the observed pad / strip multiplicity spectrum and the primary energy spectrum has been studied with cosmic ray showers , by means of a full monte carlo simulation , including the corsika code @xcite to describe the shower development in the atmosphere , and a code based on the geant package @xcite to simulate the detector response .",
    "primary particles have been sampled from the energy spectra of hrandel ( 2003 ) .",
    "the measured strip multiplicity spectrum is in good agreement with the one predicted by the simulation @xcite .",
    "the dataset for the analysis of mrk421 presented in this paper contains all showers with n@xmath1740 and zenith angle less than 40@xmath8 .",
    "no event selection based on the shower core position and no gamma - hadron discrimination have been applied in this work .",
    "a sky map in celestial coordinates ( right ascension and declination ) with 0.1@xmath270.1@xmath8 bin size , centered on the source location , is filled with the detected events . in order to extract the excess of @xmath25 rays coming from the source",
    ", the cosmic ray background must be carefully estimated and subtracted from the event map .",
    "the background is evaluated with the _ time swapping _ method @xcite .",
    "for each detected event , n `` fake '' events are generated by replacing the original arrival time with new ones , randomly selected from a buffer that spans a time t of data taking .",
    "we chose t @xmath9 3 hours to minimize the systematic effects due to the environmental parameters variations . changing the time",
    ", the fake events maintain the same declination of the original event , but have a different right ascension . with these events a new sky map ( background map )",
    "the number of fake events generated for each event is n = t(hr)@xmath215@xmath2cos(@xmath28)/2@xmath22 , where @xmath22 is the radius of the observational window in degrees ( see below ) and @xmath28 is the declination of the source . in this way",
    "the average number of fake events falling in the observational window is @xmath91 .",
    "the two maps are then `` integrated '' over a circular area of radius @xmath22 , i.e. every bin is filled with the content of all bins whose center has an angular distance less than @xmath22 from its center , with @xmath22 = 1.7@xmath8 , 0.9@xmath8 and 0.6@xmath8 for n@xmath2440 , 100 and 300 , respectively .",
    "finally the integrated background map is subtracted to the corresponding integrated event map , obtaining the `` source map '' , where for every bin the statistical significance of the excess is calculated .    with this procedure , however , since also the source events are used in the time swapping procedure , the obtained background at the source position is slightly overestimated , and the signal underestimated .",
    "this underestimation increases with the observational window size , ranging from @xmath94 to 10@xmath11 of the signal , depending on the n@xmath26 interval .",
    "the observed event rate is then corrected using the appropriate factor .",
    "the whole procedure has been tested with the crab nebula , the standard candle for vhe astronomy . at the yangbajing latitude",
    "the crab culminates at a zenith angle @xmath29 and it is observable every day for 5.8 hours with a zenith angle @xmath18 40@xmath8 .    the crab nebula was observed from 2007 december 13 to 2009 august 8 , for a total of 3150 on - source hours , obtaining a signal with a statistical significance of 7.6 standard deviations for n@xmath2440 .",
    "the average number of gamma rays detected per day is 156.6@xmath3020.6 for n@xmath2440 .    to evaluate the energy spectrum , we simulate a source in the sky following the daily path of the crab nebula , and estimate the number of events expected in different n@xmath26 intervals , as a function of the spectrum parameters .",
    "assuming a power law spectrum in the 0.1 - 80 tev energy range , the best fit to the data is dn / de = ( 4.1@xmath300.6 ) @xmath2 10@xmath3 ( e/1 tev)@xmath31 photons @xmath4s@xmath5 tev@xmath5 , in agreement with our previous measurement @xcite and with observations by other detectors , such as h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , magic @xcite and tibet as-@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this result confirms the reliability of the simulation procedure and of the energy calibration of the detector .    concerning the energy range sampled in the crab nebula measurement , about 84@xmath11 of the detected events comes from primary photons of energies greater than 300 gev , while only 8@xmath11 comes from primaries above 10 tev .",
    "the same analysis was performed for mrk421 .",
    "this source culminates at the argo - ybj location at a zenith angle @xmath29 , and it is observable every day for 6.4 hours with a zenith angle @xmath18 40@xmath8 .",
    "we evaluate the mrk421 spectrum from day 41 to 180 of 2008 , when the x - ray flux showed the most intense flares . in this period ( 754 observation hours )",
    "the signal has a statistical significance of 5.8 standard deviations .",
    "we assume a power law spectrum multiplied by an exponential factor e@xmath32 to take into account the absorption of gamma rays in the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , with the values of the optical depth @xmath33 given by raue @xmath34 mazin ( 2008 ) .",
    "the best fit spectrum obtained is : dn / de = ( 3.0@xmath35 ) @xmath2 10@xmath3(e/1.5 tev)@xmath36 e@xmath32 photons",

    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the values of the spectral index and of the gamma ray flux averaged over this 140 days period , support the correlation between spectral hardness and flux intensity reported by krennrich et al .",

    "( 2007 ) , based on observations of mrk421 in different activity states .    a complete account of the observations on mrk421 will be reported in a dedicated paper .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , two different flares have been observed from mrk421 in june 2008 , the first one peaking in x - rays on june 4 - 6 and the second one on june 11 - 13 . concerning vhe gamma rays ,",
    "cherenkov telescopes data are available only for the first flare . an energy spectrum for e @xmath7400 gev has been provided by veritas for june 6 .    since the argo - ybj sensitivity does not allow the observation of a flux a few times larger than the crab one in only one day ( i.e. during one transit of the source in the detector field of view ) , we integrated the measurement over 3 days .",
    "fig.1 shows the rate of events with n@xmath20100 observed by argo - ybj from june 3 to june 15 , averaged over 3 days , compared with the x - ray flux measured by rxte / asm in the 2 - 10 kev energy range .",
    "a correlation between the gamma ray and x - ray light curves is clearly visible . during the days",
    "june 11 - 13 , when the maximum of the second flare occurred , the excess of events from mrk421 reached a statistical significance of 3.8 standard deviations .    beside the statistical error",
    ", this measurement could be affected by a systematic uncertainty due to the background evaluation , that is the most delicate step of the analysis . in order to estimate this effect ,",
    "a completely different procedure for the background calculation has been implemented , using the so - called _ equi - zenith angle _",
    "method @xcite . in this method",
    "the events collected in 10 off - source windows of the same size of the on - source window , and aligned on both sides of the same zenith angle belt , are used to obtain the background .",
    "a detailed study of the two methods in the same sky region has shown that on average they give significances of the excesses consistent within 0.7 standard deviations , corresponding to about 20@xmath11 uncertainty on the flux estimate of the observed signal .",
    "the event rate as a function of the minimum pad multiplicity , obtained integrating the data during june 4 - 6 for the first flare ( 17.9 hours ) and during june 11 - 13 for the second one ( 18.2 hours ) , is shown in fig.2 .",
    "on the same plot , the two solid lines represent the expected rates according to the donnarumma et al .",
    "( 2009 ) model , obtanined by a simulation procedure .",
    "the sed proposed by this model has been corrected for the ebl absorption using the parameters given by raue @xmath34 mazin ( 2008 ) in order to have the flux at earth .",
    "then , using the absorbed spectrum , we simulated a source moving along the mrk421 path on the sky , and evaluated the number of events expected in the detector , for different n@xmath26 thresholds . the complete simulation procedure ( which includes the gamma ray showers propagation in the atmosphere , and the detector response ) has been tested evaluating the crab nebula flux , as shown in the previous section .    in the limit of the statistical accuracy of this measurement , our data suggest for both flares a gamma ray flux higher than that expected by the model , indicating in particular a possible hardening of the spectrum during the second flare .",
    "considering the first flare , the integral flux measured by argo - ybj above 1 tev is about 1.5 times higher than the model based on the veritas measurement , but still marginally consistent with it .",
    "the apparent disagreement between argo - ybj and veritas can be likely attributed to the non - coincidence of the data taking periods of the two detectors and to the well known small variability time scale of the source .",
    "the veritas data refer to june 6 , while the argo - ybj data are integrated over 3 days , from june 4 to 6 .",
    "furthermore , given the difference in longitude of the two detectors ( @xmath9160@xmath8 ) and the fact that they observe the source during few hours around the culmination time , they can never observe simultaneously the same object .",
    "the disagreement of our data with the model is more significant for the second flare . in order to evaluate the spectral behaviour in this period ,",
    "we assume again a power law spectrum multiplied by the ebl absorption factor e@xmath32 . from our fitting procedure",
    "we obtain : dn / de = ( 3.2@xmath37 ) @xmath2 10@xmath3(e/2.5 tev)@xmath38 e@xmath32 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 tev@xmath5 .",
    "this spectrum is shown in fig.3 as a solid line .",
    "the shaded band in the figure represents the 1 @xmath21 statistical error .",
    "the systematic errors are mainly related to the background evaluation , as discussed previously , and to the uncertainty in the absolute energy scale . according to our estimate ,",
    "they globally affect the quoted fluxes for @xmath39 30@xmath11 .    due to the low statistics , our data can not constrain the shape of the spectrum above @xmath98 tev .",
    "nevertheless the obtained flux appears , for energies @xmath02 tev , significantly larger than predicted by donnarumma et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , while the spectrum slope is consistent with that measured by the whipple cherenkov telescope during the 2000/2001 observing season for a flare of comparable intensity ( @xmath9 7 times the crab nebula flux ) , also shown in fig.3 ( dataset iii , krennrich et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) .",
    "the integral flux measured above 1 tev during june 11 - 13 is @xmath96 times larger than the crab one , making this flare one of the most powerful ever observed from mrk421 .",
    "mrk421 has been continuously monitored by argo - ybj since december 2007 , showing an average vhe flux about twice the crab nebula one from february to june 2008 , and decreasing afterwards .",
    "two strong flares in june 2008 have been observed in a multiwavelength campaign from optical to tev energies .",
    "argo - ybj measured the spectra of mrk421 above 0.3 tev during the second flare , completing the multifrequency observations . a clear correlation between the gamma ray intensity measured by argo - ybj and the x - ray flux measured by rxte / asm",
    "is found .",
    "the argo - ybj data , although averaged over 3 days , appear to support in both episodes a gamma ray flux higher than that predicted in the analysis of donnarumma et al .",
    "however , considering the short time scale variability of mrk421 , it has to be noticed that our observation time is not fully coincident with the period referred to by the theoretical curves ( june 6 for the first flare and june 12 - 13 for the second one ) .",
    "the intensity of the second flare allows us to assess its spectral shape .",
    "the deabsorbed spectrum can be fitted by a power law @xmath40 e@xmath38 extending up to several tev .",
    "this spectrum appears definitively harder than that predicted on the basis of june 12 - 13 data collected up to gev energies .    on the contrary ,",
    "our data follow the behaviour of the energy spectra measured during different activity states by the whipple cherenkov telescope . in particular , the argo - ybj data fully satisfy the relation between the spectral index and the flux obtained analyzing the measurements of mrk421 since 1995 ( see fig.3 of krennrich et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) .",
    "this result indicates that this correlation is a long term property of the source , as previously suggested by the whipple collaboration .    a global analysis of all the data collected during the 2008 june 11 - 13 flare , including the present findings ,",
    "could be used to check the compatibility of the observed phenomenology with current models for vhe photon emission in the jets of agns .",

    "<S> our data complete these observations , with the detection of a signal with a statistical significance of 3.8 standard deviations on june 11 - 13 , corresponding to a gamma ray flux about 6 times larger than the crab one above 1 tev .    </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed differential spectrum , corrected for the intergalactic absorption , can be represented by a power law with an index @xmath6 extending up to several tev . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum slope is fully consistent with previous observations reporting a correlation between the flux and the spectral index , suggesting that this property is maintained in different epochs and characterizes the source emission processes . </S>"
