    "the situation of direct cp violation @xmath0 in the neutral kaon system used to be somewhat unclear , but ktev result @xcite and the na48 result reported at this meeting @xcite made the experimental situation basically settled .",
    "the numbers on @xmath2 reported are . ]",

    "two bosch estimates use different renormalization schemes ( ndr and hv ) . [",
    "cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the other hand , the theoretical situation is rather unclear .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 in the standard model is difficult partly because of a cancellation between gluon and electroweak penguins which makes the result sensitive to the precise values of the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "a ( not complete ) list of theoretical calculations is given in table  [ tab : estimates ] .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more details on this issue .",
    "the experimental values are compared to the `` probability density distributions for @xmath2 '' @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] .",
    "there is a feeling in the community that the data came out rather high , even though one can not draw a definite conclusion if the standard model accounts for the observed high value because of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "= 0.7    of course the correct strategy to resolve this issue is to improve theoretical calculations , probably relying on the progress in lattice calculations .",
    "unfortunately , this is a challenging program and we can not expect an immediate resolution .",
    "what i instead attempt in this talk is the alternative approach : think about new physics candidates which are `` reasonable '' and at the same time account for the observed value of @xmath2 .",
    "since any new physics explanation would probably give rise to other consequences , the cross - check can start eliminating such possibilities .",
    "if all `` reasonable '' candidates get excluded , one can draw a conclusion that the standard model should account for the observed high value of @xmath0 . or such a cross - check might confirm other consequences which would be truly exciting .",
    "naturally , i turned my attention to supersymmetry , most widely discussed candidate of physics beyond the standard model , and asked the question if supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 can be interesting at all .",
    "there are many studies of @xmath0 in supersymmetric models , most notably @xcite .",
    "their detailed study found the possible range of supersymmetric contribution , @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "then clearly supersymmetry can not account for the observed high value , and indeed i do not have anything new to add to their beautiful analysis within the framework they used : the minimal supergravity model .    the reason why supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 is small",
    "can be quite easily understood . within the minimal supergravity framework ,",
    "the main contribution to flavor - changing effects between the first and second generations originate in the left - handed squark mass - squared matrix . in general , the superpartners of the left - handed quarks have a mass - squared matrix @xmath11 if there is a non - vanishing off - diagonal element @xmath12 in the above mass - squared matrix , it would contribute to flavor - changing processes from loop diagrams .",
    "the easiest way to study such contributions is to use the mass insertion formalism where one treats the off - diagonal element perturbatively as an `` interaction '' in the squark propagator , because the existent constraints require the off - diagonal element to be small anyway .",
    "the size of such a perturbation can be nicely parameterized by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the average of the two diagonal elements .",
    "= 0.45 = 0.45    contribution of the mass insertion to @xmath0 is given by for simplicity .",
    "see @xcite for more details . ]",
    "@xcite : @xmath15 a representative feynman diagram is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ll ] . on the other hand , the insertion of the same parameter @xmath16 induces kaon mixing parameters @xmath17 a representative feynman diagram",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ll ] .",
    "therefore , once the constraints from @xmath18 and @xmath19 are satisfied , it does not allow a large contribution to @xmath0 unless some fine - tuning is done .",
    "this simple comparison already gives a typical order of magnitude @xmath20 , with some wiggle room by varying @xmath21 , allowing chargino contributions , etc . beyond this estimate by assuming that @xmath16 is nearly pure imaginary because @xmath22 is then nearly pure real and hence @xmath19 constraint is satisfied .",
    "] this leads to the basic conclusion in @xcite that the supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 is never important .",
    "amplitude from supersymmetry . a generally missed contribution to @xmath23 amplitude due to the isospin breaking",
    "@xmath24 leads to a too - large @xmath0 if the splitting is @xmath25 .",
    "a more natural size of splitting from the renormalization - group point of view is of order 10% , and with a quarter of the maximum possible value of @xmath26 , the resulting size of @xmath0 is in the ballpark of the observed value @xcite . ]",
    "antonio masiero and myself found that there is a loophole in previous discussions why supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 is small @xcite . from an enhanced @xmath27 vertex",
    "was suggested @xcite which is subject to tighter constraints phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "] we pointed out that a broad class of supersymmetric models actually gives an important contribution , @xmath28 where the uncertainties come from model dependence and hadronic matrix elements .",
    "i discuss the angle @xmath29 and the origin of this new contribution below .",
    "the masses of quarks arise from the coupling of left - handed and right - handed quarks to the higgs expectation value , @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is higgs field which couples to the down - type quarks in the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "similarly , in addition to the mass - squared mass matrix ( [ eq : ll ] ) for the left - handed squarks and the analogous one for the right - handed squarks , there is another contribution to the masses of squarks which mix left - handed and right - handed particles , @xmath32 the important point here is , without going into detailed discussions of models , we expect the matrix @xmath33 to have similar structure as the yukawa matrix @xmath34 because they have exactly the same property under the flavor symmetries .",
    "i will describe this point more clearly in the context of models later on , but based on this simple fact , i expect @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the typical mass scale of supersymmetry breaking ( _ i.e. _ , superparticle masses ) .",
    "it is possible that @xmath33 and @xmath37 are exactly proportional to each other as matrices , which was assumed in the minimal supergravity and hence in previous analyses , but not necessarily .",
    "generically , one expects the following patterns for yukawa and @xmath38 matrices , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are @xmath25 unknown constants and @xmath43 .",
    "the ( 2,1 ) elements are intentionally left blank because we do not know the mixing angles of right - handed quarks ( read : model - dependent ) .    in order to discuss flavor - changing effects from squarks ,",
    "one first needs to go to the mass basis for quarks , which is achieved by rotating the yukawa matrix by the cabibbo angle @xmath44 .",
    "the same rotation acts on the @xmath38 matrix , but unless @xmath45 , it still leaves the off - diagonal element after rotation @xmath46 .",
    "we can again describe its effect in terms of a mass insertion parameter @xmath47 it contributes to the flavor - changing chromo - electric dipole moment @xmath48 @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lr ] ) , where @xmath50 is the gluon field strength .",
    "this operator generates a supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 as @xmath51 , which gives eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilonp ] ) .",
    "the model uncertainty ( 0.52 ) comes from the lack of knowledge on the @xmath25 constant @xmath52 , and also that we do not know the ratio of @xmath36 in the lr mass matrix relative to the average squark mass .",
    "the phase factor is @xmath53 .",
    "finally the matrix element of this operator between kaon and two - pion states vanishes at the lowest order in chiral perturbation theory , and it was estimated in @xcite using the chiral quark model .",
    "i have arbitrarily assigned a factor of two uncertainty ( 0.52 ) as a guess.@xmath54 in their notation and have emphasized that the sign of the matrix element is model - dependent . ]",
    "note that the exact proportionality between yukawa and @xmath38 matrices assumed in the minimal supergravity automatically makes the off - diagonal element vanish after diagonalizing the yukawa matrix and hence no flavor - changing effects .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the lr mass insertion has been regarded unimportant in the literature .",
    "but such an exact proportionality is a strong assumption with no justification .",
    "the constraint from @xmath19 on lr mass insertion is an order of magnitude weaker : @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological fact that the constraint from @xmath19 still allows an interesting lr contribution to @xmath0 has been known ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "but the natural size of @xmath56 has not been discussed and it was always assumed to be smaller than the size estimated here due to various prejudices partly because of the constraint from the neutron electric dipole moment ( see discussions later ) .",
    "= 0.45 = 0.45    the reason why this supersymmetric contribution is competitive ( or larger ) than the standard model contribution is basically because of the larger km factor as seen in the following back - of - envelope estimate .",
    "the estimate of the supersymmetry contribution is given by @xmath57 and is suppressed only by the cabibbo angle in the lr mass insertion . on the other hand the standard model qcd penguin",
    "is suppressed because all three generations should participate for cp - violation : @xmath58 @xmath59 . to compare them",
    ", @xmath60 in the supersymmetric contribution can be regarded as an @xmath25 parameter in kaon decays .",
    "the mass scale is higher @xmath61 , but the km factor is larger by 100 .",
    "however the matrix element of the chromo - electric dipole moment operator vanishes at the leading order in chiral perturbation theory @xcite , resulting in about a factor of ten suppression , which brings the supersymmetry contribution roughly on par with the qcd penguin . finally , the qcd model penguin is partially canceled by the electroweak penguin .",
    "this leaves the supersymmetry contribution important in @xmath0 .",
    "now that we have found the new supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 based on general grounds , it is important to ask what class of models actually gives such a contribution . because we are talking about flavor physics issues in supersymmetry here ( see @xcite for a good summary in this context )",
    ", we need to look at models which naturally explain the hierarchy in fermion masses .    the easiest example to explain is the model based on u(2 ) flavor symmetry @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the first and second generations form a doublet under the u(2 ) flavor symmetry , and the third generation a singlet .",
    "this makes the ll squark mass - squared matrix ( [ eq : ll ] ) an identity matrix and helps to keep the first and second generation scalars to avoid too - large flavor - changing effects in @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the flavor symmetry allows the top yukawa coupling , but forbids down and strange yukawa couplings and hence needs to be broken by some vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "they introduce two such vevs , one in the symmetric tensor of u(2 ) @xmath62 and the other in the anti - symmetric tensor @xmath63 , which can generate the yukawa matrix @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the energy scale of the flavor physics .",
    "the point here is that ( 2,2 ) and ( 1,2 ) elements originate from couplings to different fields @xmath66 and @xmath67 and hence their supersymmetry breaking counterparts can have different coefficients , giving in general @xmath68 in the lr mass matrix ( [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the string theory , where the yukawa couplings @xmath34 are in general functions of so - called moduli fields @xmath69 : @xmath70 .",
    "the moduli fields also acquire supersymmetry breaking vev ( @xmath71 ) , and the lr mass matrix is given by @xmath72 . generally , these two matrices are not proportional to each other , even though their structures are likely to be similar if the yukawa hierarchy is natural , _",
    "i.e. _ , stable under small changes of the moduli",
    ". a particular realization of this idea is an attempt to generate yukawa hierarchy as a consequence of a somewhat large compactification radius of an orbifold and fields of different generations belonging to twisted sectors of different fixed points .",
    "then the modular invariance requires yukawa couplings to be proportional to powers of dedekind eta function @xmath73 : @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is the modular weight ) @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can generate a yukawa hierarchy because @xmath76 for a large @xmath69 . then the derivative picks the power @xmath77 which is generation dependent and hence @xmath78 again .",
    "the flavor - changing effects from the ll mass insertion , however , is a problem in general string models .",
    "i have to emphasize that not all supersymmetric models give this type of contributions to @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the models with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( see @xcite for a review ) give either vanishing @xmath38-matrix or one proportional to the yukawa matrix and hence does not give interesting @xmath0 .",
    "if the cabibbo angle originates in the up sector , the naive analysis here also fails .",
    "also , the @xmath38-matrix may be real .",
    "all i can argue here is that we generically expect supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 as in ( [ eq : epsilonp ] ) , but there are exceptions .",
    "see @xcite for more discussions on model - dependence .",
    "since supersymmetry can give a contribution to @xmath0 or an interesting size , we should now ask if there are other consequences of this . the immediate question is the neutron electric dipole moment . again using the mass insertion technique , the current constraint is @xmath79 @xcite , while my estimate is @xmath80 .",
    "if we are interested in a large supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 , it is natural to expect a phase of order unity in @xmath81 as well .",
    "this basically saturates the current upper limit for a phase of order a third , and an improve experimental bound would be extremely interesting .",
    "the phase in @xmath81 , however , is in principle unrelated to that in @xmath82 , and in fact some models give a real @xmath81 despite a complex @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "a more exciting aspect is that hyperon cp violation arise from the same chromo - electric dipole moment operator which generates supersymmetric @xmath0 and in principle there is a perfect correlation .",
    "unfortunately the matrix element uncertainties obscures the correlation but pakvasa argued that the hyperon cp violation should appear within the sensitivity of the current hypercp experiment if @xmath0 is saturated by supersymmetry in the way i described @xcite . it would the most direct test of this possibility .",
    "another important question is what the corresponding flavor - changing effects in the lepton sector would be .",
    "in fact , we found a new contribution to @xmath83 which was also generally missed in the literature .",
    "unfortunately the estimate is uncertain because we do not know the mixing angle in the lepton sector , but a reasonable guess is @xmath840.05 suggested by the small angle msw solution .",
    "the new limit from mega collaboration @xcite @xmath85 ( 90% cl ) leads to the bound on the mass insertion parameter @xmath86 .",
    "this is to be compared to the estimate @xmath87 .",
    "note that this bound is on the _ magnitude _ of the parameter , not its imaginary part , and is hence more difficult to avoid .",
    "one can regard this estimate as a lower bound on @xmath88 of about 500  gev , which is much stronger than previously discussed limits .",
    "the electron electric dipole moment @xmath89 ( 90% cl ) translates to the limit @xmath90 , compared to the estimate @xmath91 .",
    "the supersymmetric contribution again nearly saturates the constraint and a future improvement of the bound would be useful .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested that there may also be enhancements in @xmath92 @xcite and @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "see also discussions in @xcite .",
    "overall , the naive estimate of the lr mass insertion i ve described gives interesting and important contributions to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 and those on the first two had been generally missed in the literature .",
    "we reexamined the supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 , and found that an important contribution had been missed in the literature .",
    "the assumptions that went into the estimate are : ( a ) hierarchical yukawa matrix is probably controlled by certain flavor symmetries , ( b ) @xmath38-matrix is subject to the same control which makes its structure similar to the yukawa matrix but not necessarily exactly proportional to each other , ( c ) cabibbo rotation arises in the down sector , and ( d ) @xmath25-ish phase in the @xmath38-matrix . given these assumptions , we came up with the estimate eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilonp ] ) which surprisingly is in the ballpark of reported experimental values without any fine - tuning .",
    "if @xmath0 is dominated by the supersymmetric contribution described here , it should give important contribution to the hyperon cp violation and possibly also to the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "correspondingly , there is an important contribution to @xmath96 and possibly also to the electron electric dipole moment .",
