    "one of the important problem in the field of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to find out the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter formed after nuclear collisions at ultra - relativistic energies  @xcite . under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the eos is the functional relation between pressure ( p ) and the energy density ( @xmath1 ) , where p and @xmath1 are related through the velocity of sound , @xmath2 which is defined as @xmath3  @xcite . for a massless , non - interacting gas , @xmath4 ( ideal gas limit ) .",
    "the velocity of sound plays a crucial role in the hydro - dynamical evolution of the matter created in heavy - ion collision and affects , among others , the momentum distribution of the particles originating from the fluid elements at the freeze - out stage . in the present work",
    "we will assume the order of the phase transition from qgp to hadrons to be first order .",
    "however , it should be mentioned here that this issue is not fully settled yet .",
    "the phase transition from qgp to hadrons could be weak first order , second order or it may be just a cross over depending on the mass of the dynamical quarks  @xcite .",
    "consider a situation where quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed at the initial state .",
    "in such a scenario , the matter evolves from an initial qgp state to the hadronic phase via an intermediate mixed phase of qgp and hadrons due to the expansion of the system ( hence cooling ) in a first order phase transition scenario .",
    "finally the system disassembles to hadrons ( mainly pions ) at the freeze - out where the interaction among the particles become too weak to maintain the equilibrium .",
    "the velocity of sound is very different in the three stages of expansion mentioned above reflecting the interaction among the constituents of the matter in the three stages . while in the qgp phase",
    ", it should in principle approach the ideal gas limit , in the mixed phase it should reduce to zero due to vanishing pressure gradient , indicating `` softness '' of the eos . then below the critical temperature , it should have a value that reflects the presence of interacting hadrons in the system .",
    "relativistic hydro - dynamical models have been routinely used to describe the multiplicity distribution in the rapidity space , transverse mass spectra of hadrons etc produced in nuclear collisions .",
    "one of the aim of the present work is to calculate the velocity of sound for hadronic system and compare the results with lattice qcd calculations . in the present calculation",
    "we have taken into account the non - zero width of the unstable hadrons .",
    "we study the rapidity distribution of the particles within the framework of relativistic hydro - dynamical models proposed by landau and collaborators  @xcite and by bjorken  @xcite .",
    "the results of the analysis performed within these models will be compared with experiments to extract the velocity of sound .",
    "it is expected that at ags and also at sps energies , the landau hydro - dynamical model can be applied although the bjorken hydro - dynamical model has been used at sps energies .",
    "the main criticisms of landau model are : ( i ) neglect of leading particle effects and ( ii ) removal of radiation energy due to the deceleration required in this model for full stopping .",
    "these difficulties , however , can be removed if one assume that during the collisions the valence quarks move without much interaction and the energy carried by the gluon fields is stopped in the collision volume  @xcite .",
    "this assumption is justified because the gluon - gluon interaction cross - section is larger than quark - quark interaction due to larger color degeneracy of the gluons .",
    "the gluon field thermalizes after a time @xmath5 , providing the initial condition of the landau model . in this picture",
    "the removal of energy of the decelerated gluons fields due to the bremsstrahlung is prohibited by the color confinement mechanism . under these conditions , it is obvious that only a fraction of the beam energy is stopped in the collisions , which can be taken into account by introducing an in - elasticity factor in the model  @xcite .    bjorken hydrodynamical model predicts a plateau structure for the rapidity distribution of the fluid elements which is not observed experimentally for the entire rapidity range .",
    "it has been indicated in  @xcite from perturbative qcd that the initial energy distribution is a broad gaussian in rapidity even at lhc energies .",
    "however , we will show that a good description of the data is possible at ags and sps energies in the framework of the bjorken s model if we treat the upper limit of the fluid rapidity as a parameter .",
    "in other words the boost invariance has to be limited in a finite rapidity range for the description of the data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we obtain the velocity of sound for a hadronic model and compare the result with the lattice qcd calculations  @xcite and those obtained from a simple confinement model as discussed in ref  @xcite . in section iii",
    "we extract the velocity of sound from the particle number density in rapidity space at ags and sps energies . finally in section",

    "we try to extract the velocity of sound from the rapidity distributions of various hadrons produced from heavy - ion collisions for various collision energies using hydro - dynamical model .",
    "we then compare the values obtained with the results of the model under consideration .",
    "there are two well known hydro - dynamical models as mentioned before  @xcite for the description of the space time evolution of the system formed after the collision of heavy - ions .",
    "it may be mentioned that in the coherent interactions the collective effect is an important feature , unlike incoherent collisions where collision is considered to be a succession of independent nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the basic difference is , in landau s model , in the center of mass of the collision two nuclei would be stopped and all the kinetic energy would be used up for the particle production , while the baryon transparency in the mid - rapidity region is the basic feature of the bjorken s model .",
