    "the processes of surface reconstruction play a central role in heterogeneous catalysis @xcite .",
    "a prominent example of a catalyst with the reactivity strongly affected by the rearrangement of the substrate atoms is the pt(100 ) surface .",
    "the mechanism of such rearrangements is the tensile excess stress due to charge depletion of 5d orbitals of surface pt atoms @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the bulk - like ( @xmath3 ) termination of clean pt(100 ) corresponding to the square configuration of pt atoms becomes metastable which causes a transformation to the hexagonal ( hex ) surface atomic arrangement . from the point of view of the catalytic properties , the crucial importance has the fact that such surface reconstructions are strongly affected by the adsorbates .",
    "the co - induced lifting of the hex surface reconstruction and the stabilization of the @xmath4 phase is forced by a gain in the co adsorption energy and proceeds through the nucleation of ( @xmath0)-islands with high co coverage @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of pt surfaces is a key factor responsible for their complex oscillating behavior and pattern formation @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that the stable pt(111 ) surface where the reconstruction is not observed , does not exhibit oscillation properties . during the reconstruction , the surface of pt(100 ) becomes inhomogeneous and contains coexisting micrometer - size regions of different ( hex and square ) atomic configurations .",
    "as demonstrated in low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) studies @xcite , the propagating waves of surface modification can result in highly irregular spatio - temporal character of the oscillations .",
    "even with a constant oscillation period , the time variation of the local leed intensity of small surface spots differs from the temporal behavior of the intensities integrated over the whole surface area @xcite .",
    "such a behavior is in contrast to the uniform oscillations on pt(110 ) surfaces originating from the global coupling of various surface patches through the gas phase @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the mechanism of the global coupling has been extensively studied in a series of experimental works and by the theoretical modelling @xcite . in distinction to pt(110 ) , the irregular oscillations during co oxidation on pt(100 ) possibly originate from the propagating chemical reaction fronts which can be triggered by defects and other surface imperfections @xcite .",
    "the kinetic monte carlo simulations performed for the heterogeneous pt(100 ) surfaces containing mesoscopic hex regions in macroscopic ( @xmath0 ) surrounding , have essentially shown local unsynchronized oscillations@xcite .",
    "these local oscillations disappear on the @xmath5m  scale , whereas the experiment demonstrates well developed irregular oscillations even on the macroscopic mm - scale @xcite .",
    "another aspect which can lead to the irregular temporal character of oscillations is the stong fluctuations on nm - size catalyst particles with ( 100)-facets @xcite .",
    "as the fluctuations in surface coverages are increasing with the decrease of the system size @xcite , they can not satisfactorily explain the irregularities observed on single crystal surfaces of pt(100 ) .    to gain deeper insight into the nature of the irregular behavior , in the present work we consider a modelling of spatially inhomogeneous pt(100 ) surfaces . in our approach ,",
    "we account for the fact that the hex - square transformation occurs through a hysteresis and has a character of a first - order phase transition . under the non - equilibrium conditions ,",
    "the hysteresis features are described in terms of a bistable behavior which is characterized by a coexistence of the hex and square phases in a wide range of temperatures and partial pressures .",
    "such a mechanism allows to obtain in a natural way the inhomogeneous surface state , without introducing additional separate variables for the description of the adsorbate coverage in different phases . upon the increase of temperature and co pressure ,",
    "the bistable region narrows and terminates at a bifurcation cusp point ( @xmath6  k , @xmath7  torr ) . due to strong fluctuations near this critical point",
    ", the behavior at high temperatures and pressures should be qualitatively different from the hysteresis - type behavior observed on pt(100 ) under ultahigh vacuum conditions@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we address two main questions related to the surface inhomogeneities .",
    "first , we analyze the role of the inhomogeneities in the nucleation and growth of adsorbate islands .",
    "we find that the difference between the co desorption rates for the hex and square substrate geometries is responsible for the trapping of the adsorbed co @xcite , a property responsible for the growth of co islands during the hex - square transformation .",
    "second , we study the oscillation behavior on inhomogeneous surface during the reaction of co oxidation .",
    "we show that the surface inhomogeneities lead to the benjamin - feir instability and to a new inhomogeneous oscillating regime .",
    "this new regime is characterized by the random standing waves in spatially separated surface regions .",
    "we investigate the driving mechanisms of irregular oscillations and provide the analysis of the stability of the system with respect to nonuniform perturbations .",
    "the obtained deformations of the chemical wave fronts appear to be a direct consequence of structural inhomogeneities typical for pt(100 ) , and can be a possible clue for the explanation of the irregular oscillating behavior on this type of surfaces .",
    "a fundamental property related to the adsorption of co on low - index pt(100 ) surfaces is a transformation of the initially stable reconstructed hex pt surface into the bulk - like ( @xmath0 ) structure .",
    "the lifting of the surface reconstruction is activated in the case when the concentration ( coverage ) of adsorbed co exceeds a critical value @xmath8  ml . in a wide range of the co surface coverages @xmath9 ( @xmath10  ml ) , the surface contains the coexisting areas of the ( @xmath0)- and hex - geometry @xcite . in the leed experiments ,",
    "the range of temperatures and co partial pressures determining the phase coexistence is identified by a hysteresis behavior of leed intensities @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the nonequilibrium conditions , the hex-(@xmath0 ) coexistence should be described in terms of a bistable behavior . to provide a consistent analysis of the co controlled bistability",
    ", we introduce a variable @xmath11 for the description of the co surface coverage and a parameter @xmath12 which measures a degree of the surface reconstruction .",
    "the value @xmath13 corresponds to a fully reconstructed hex surface whereas the maximal value @xmath14 describes the recovered homogeneous ( @xmath0 ) state .    within the two - variables approach ,",
    "the process of the co - induced surface transformation contains two main stages .",
    "the first stage includes the change of the local mesoscopically averaged co surface coverage during the steps of co adsorption , desorption and co diffusion on pt surface : @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the partial pressure and the impingement rate of co , respectively , and @xmath18 refers to the maximal ( corresponding to a saturation ) co coverage ; @xmath19 is the co diffusion coefficient .",
    "the factor @xmath20 models the precursor - type kinetics of the co adsorption @xcite . in our analysis , a typical value @xmath21 for the precursor factor is chosen .",
    "for the kinetic processes on the inhomogeneous surface containing a mixture of hex- and ( @xmath0)-islands , we need to consider two different contributions to the adsorption / desorption steps in ( [ a ] ) .",
    "these two different types originate from the processes co@xmath22co@xmath23 and co@xmath22co@xmath24 which contribute with the weights @xmath25 and @xmath12 to the total rates of surface adsorption and desorption . as a consequence ,",
    "the final expression for the co sticking and co desorption coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 contain both contributions @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the expressions for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the co sticking and desorption coefficients in the hex and ( @xmath3 ) phases , respectively .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , the low desorption rate @xmath34 is a prime factor responsible for high co coverages of the ( @xmath3 ) surface .",
    "in contrast , due to higher desorption rate on the hex surface , significant part of adsorbed co molecules desorps which leads to substantially lower co coverages in the hex state .    for the sticking coefficients ,",
    "we use the values @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , hex geometry ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xmath0 geometry ) reported in ref .  .",
    "in the arrhenius - type form of the desorption coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath34 we choose the following values for the rate parameters : @xmath39  s@xmath40 and @xmath41  s@xmath40 ; @xmath42  kcal / mol and @xmath43",

    "the rate of the lifting is proportional to the co coverage @xmath45 and to the factor @xmath46 which is a mean - field form of the effective flux between the hex and ( @xmath3)- regions . by introducing the step function @xmath47 ( @xmath48 for @xmath49 and 0 otherwise ) , we account for the experimental observation that the transition to the ( @xmath0 ) phase does not occur below a critical coverage @xmath50 . in our calculations , we describe the transition rate @xmath51 by an arrhenius - type expression where the activation energy @xmath52  kcal / mol corresponds to a small activation barrier for the transformation from the hex- to the ( @xmath0)-state @xcite , and the prefactor @xmath53  s@xmath40 gives correct time scales for the transformation in the considered temperature interval @xcite .",
    "the second term in ( [ n ] ) refers to the reverse ( @xmath3)@xmath54hex reconstruction with a rate coefficient @xmath55 . here",
    "the factor @xmath56 accounts for the property that the reconstruction can occur locally if a small cluster of neighbouring surface positions ( a pair in the simplest case ) is not occupied by adsorbed co which is in analogy with the assumption considered in @xcite .    for an inhomogeneous surface , the laplacian term @xmath57 in ( [ n ] ) originates from the contribution of the interfaces between different surface geometries to the total system energy @xcite",
    "consequently , the coefficient @xmath58 describes the energy costs of such interfaces and is related to the characteristic interface width @xmath59 which is typically of the order of few nanometers .",
    "we note that the characteristic diffusion length of the adsorbed co is given by @xmath60 and is of the order of several micrometers .",
    "the fast co diffusion between the hex- and ( @xmath3)-areas described by the diffusion term in ( [ a ] ) , controls the @xmath5 m size of co islands which is discussed in details in section  [ nucleation ] .    the equations ( [ a ] ) and ( [ n ] ) can be transformed by the substitution : @xmath61 into the following dimensionless form @xmath62 where @xmath63 for a given @xmath64 , the second equation ( [ an ] ) leads to the two stable steady states : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    ", we will omit for convenience the tilde signs in the notations of dimensionless time and coordinate .",
    "a remarkable property of the system ( [ sa ] ) , ( [ an ] ) , ( [ f12 ] ) is a strong dependence of the co adsorption and desorption rates on the local configurational state of the surface determined by the parameter @xmath12 . in analogy to @xcite",
    ", this dependence can can be conveniently analyzed in terms of a net sticking probability of co molecules defined as @xmath69 specifically , despite a large initial sticking coefficient @xmath31 in the hex regions , the significant contribution of the second desorption term in ( [ nets ] ) results in a suppression of @xmath70 which reflects the fact of low co coverages @xmath71  ml observed on the reconstructed surfaces .",

    "[ fig11](a ) ) .",
    "the positive @xmath205 for nonzero @xmath188 indicates the formation of the inhomogeneous state presented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) shows that the bulk - like oscillation state which develops in an initially homogeneous region @xmath147 of a maximal length @xmath206 m , is unstable with respect to inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "on such a substrate , the uniform oscillations can not be destroyed by homogeneous perturbations which is reflected in @xmath207 in fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) .",
    "in contrast , due to the positive @xmath208 , the inhomogeneous perturbations diverge and lead to spatially modulated oscillatins .",
    "the principal feature of @xmath205 is its almost dispersionless ( flat ) character which can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) .",
    "specifically , for all values of @xmath204 we obtain an initial increase of @xmath205 at small @xmath188 , with a further saturation to the maximal constant value which occurs for larger @xmath209 ( fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) ) . this `` flat - band''-character is in strong contrast to the dispersion @xmath205 usually obtained in the modelling of the global coupling for pt(110 ) @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath205 has a distinct well - defined maximum at a certain @xmath210 which corresponds to the appearance of spatial clusters with @xmath211-modulation . in our case , due to the flatness of @xmath205 at larger @xmath188 , no distinctly leading mode can be formed . instead",
    ", all possible @xmath188-modulations can exist in such an instable system .",
    "this is the key reason for a highly irregular form of the standing waves in fig .",
    "although keeping the basic features related to the central symmetry , the irregular wave profiles are strongly sensitive to the initial state of substrate and to the initial spatial distributions of adsorbate coverages , and in this sence they are random . in the real systems , the type of irregular profile can be pinned by surface defects like steps and surface imperfections , with possible further random changes caused by the noise in the system .",
    "in fact , the obtained spatio - temporal evolution of the irregular oscillations on the substrate is consistent with the the development of irregular patterns on spatially separated patches typically observed on pt(100 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the inhomogeneous oscillating states and standing waves have been previously discussed for co oxidation on pt(110 ) where the main mechanism responsible for these phenomena is the coupling through the gas phase @xcite .",
    "in contrast to pt(110 ) , on pt(100 ) the inhomogeneities in the surface geometry play a central role .",
    "such inhomogeneities lead to the nucleation of adsorbate islands and to a decisive role of the boundaries between geometrically different surface areas in the formation of standing waves and irregular oscillations .",
    "we have studied the co adsorption and catalytic co oxidation on inhomogeneous pt(100 ) surfaces which contain structurally different hex and ( @xmath3)-domains . in our model , the structural surface transformation is described in terms of a bistability characterized by a coexistence of the reconstructed and @xmath0 surface areas .",
    "the bistable region terminates in the critical cusp point which can be approached at higher temperatures and pressures .",
    "due to significant increase of the fluctuations , the behavior in the vicinity of the cusp point should be qualitatively different from the hysteresis - type behavior typically observed in the experiments under ultrahigh vacuum conditions .",
    "we have also studied the nucleation and growth of co islands on inhomogeneous substrate , a process driven by the difference in the desorption properties of co in the hex and @xmath0 phases .",
    "we have also performed the analysis of the oscillation behavior on the surface during the co oxidation .",
    "the surface inhomogeneities lead to the benjamin - feir instability and to the irregular standing waves of adsorbate coverages .",
    "the obtained deformations of the wave fronts is a direct consequence of structural inhomogeneities typical for pt(100 ) which allows to gain deeper insight into the nature of irregular oscillations on this type of surfaces .",
