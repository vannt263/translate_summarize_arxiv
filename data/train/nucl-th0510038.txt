    "hydrodynamic models have been very successful in describing the collective behavior of matter at rhic , such as single particle spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "in particular the strong elliptic flow which , for the first time , reaches the hydrodynamic limit at rhic , provides us with a new understanding of the nature of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created at rhic as strongly interacting or correlated qgp @xcite . however there exist a number of experimental observations that contradict perfect hydrodynamic models : transverse momentum spectra above 2 gev , elliptic flow at large pseudo - rapdities @xmath0 and hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) interferometry .",
    "these observations suggest that there exist limitations to the application of a simple perfect hydrodynamic model to rhic physics and that an improvement on a perfect hydrodynamic model is needed in order to obtain a comprehensive and unified description of the data from the point of view of hydrodynamics .",
    "in general , hydrodynamic models require initial conditions , an equations of state ( eos ) and freezeout conditions as parameters besides the relativistic hydrodynamic equation .",
    "one of the main advantages of the hydrodynamic model lies in its ability to investigate the relation between the eos and physical observables via comparison to experimental data .",
    "however , it has been pointed out repeatedly , e.g. by hirano @xcite , that details of the treatment of the freeze - out process can have large effects on physical observables . for example",
    ", the data on @xmath1 spectra and elliptic flow show that the assumption of chemical equilibrium @xcite or partial chemical equilibrium @xcite in the freezeout process is not realistic @xcite .",
    "in addition , studies of collective flow at ags , sps and rhic based on both of hydrodynamic models and cascade models suggest that the effects of viscosity are not negligible @xcite .",
    "therefore we construct a hybrid 3-d hydro + cascade model to include a realistic treatment of the freezeout process and viscosity in the hadronic phase .",
    "such hybrid models have been implemented in the past , however with reduced dimensionality in the hydrodynamic component and thus with restrictions to observables at mid - rapidity @xcite . as a cascade model",
    "we use urqmd in which final state interactions are included correctly @xcite .",
    "we solve the relativistic hydrodynamic equation , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is energy momentum tensor , including baryon number conservation , + @xmath4 .",
    "we modify our original code for the hydrodynamic expansion in cartesian coordinates @xcite to that in light - cone coordinates @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , in order to optimize our hydrodynamic model for ultra - relativistic high energy heavy collisions @xcite .",
    "we employ lagrangian hydrodynamics which has the following advantages over eulerian hydrodynamics @xcite : 1 ) we can trace the adiabatic path of each volume element of fluid on phase diagram .",
    "2 ) we can easily investigate effects of phase transition on physical observables .",
    "we assume that hydrodynamic expansion starts at @xmath7 fm .",
    "initial energy density and baryon number density are parameterized by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the impact parameter and the maximum value of energy density ( baryon number density ) , respectively .",

    "parameters @xmath10 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are listed in table [ table : initial ] .",
    "we set initial flow in the longitudinal direction to @xmath18 ( bjorken s solution ) and @xmath19 in the transverse plane .",
    "we use an equation of state with a 1st order phase transition , namely a bag model eos with and excluded volume correction @xcite .",
    "the thermal freezeout temperature is 110 mev .",
    "the key improvements of the hybrid model approach compared to the 3-d hydrodynamic model are the inclusion of viscosity in the hadronic phase as well a realistic treatment of final state interactions and a species dependent freezeout process . for the transition from hydrodynamic model to urqmd",
    "we introduce the switching temperature @xmath20 which should be chosen below but near the critical temperature ( @xmath21 mev @xcite ) .",
    "we set the switching temperature to 150 mev .",
    "the calculated procedure is as follows : first hadron distributions from the hydrodynamic model are calculated at the switching temperature via the cooper - frye formula @xcite .",
    "second , initial conditions for urqmd on an event by event basis are generated from the hadron distributions via the hydrodynamic expansion through a monte carlo implementation .",
    "finally the urqmd calculation starts with these initial conditions . in this scheme",
    "we neglect the reverse contribution from urqmd to the hydrodynamic model . for an initial condition for 3-d hydro + urqmd we assume the same parameterization as that of pure hydrodynamic model except the value of maximum energy density , which we have adjusted to achieve a better agreement to experimental data .",

    "we find that the average transverse momentum @xmath34 for @xmath22 decreases whereas the proton @xmath1 increases . since the number of @xmath22 is larger compared to that of @xmath24 , the effect on the protons per particle is larger than for the pions .",
