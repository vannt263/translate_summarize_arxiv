    "<S> suspended graphene sheets exhibit correlated random deformations that can be studied under the framework of rough surfaces with a hurst ( roughness ) exponent @xmath0 . here , we show that , independent of the temperature , the iso - height lines at the percolation threshold have a well - defined fractal dimension and are conformally invariant , sharing the same statistical properties as schramm - loewner evolution ( sle@xmath1 ) curves with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , iso - height lines of other rough surfaces are not necessarily conformally invariant even if they have the same hurst exponent , e.g. random gaussian surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the distribution of the modulus of the fourier coefficients plays an important role on this property . </S>",
    "<S> our results not only introduce a new universality class and place the study of suspended graphene membranes within the theory of critical phenomena , but also provide hints on the long - standing question about the origin of conformal invariance in iso - height lines of rough surfaces .    </S>",
    "<S> rough surfaces are very common in nature and can be found , for instance , in real landscapes @xcite and growth surface processes @xcite . in many cases </S>",
    "<S> , they can be characterised by a hurst ( roughness ) exponent that describes the height - height correlations of the surface , and consequently , being called self - affine . </S>",
    "<S> random gaussian surfaces ( rgs ) with positive hurst exponents are examples of rough self - affine surfaces , and their use has become very popular since they are analytically tractable . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was suggested that iso - height lines in this type of rgs are not conformally invariant @xcite , since their statistics is not compatible with the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) theory @xcite ( random curves satisfying sle statistics are necessarily conformally invariant ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fact that iso - height lines of other self - affine rough surfaces , e.g. some grown surfaces @xcite , follow sle theory opens the question on which are the main properties that are responsible for conformal invariance .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene , consisting of literally a single carbon monolayer , represents the first instance of a truly two - dimensional material ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : snapshot ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it owes its stability to the anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes , and the resulting deformation in the third dimension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the study of these deformations , often called ripples , is very important because they affect the electronic and mechanical properties . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it has been shown that reducing height fluctuations in graphene samples increases their electronic mobility and electrical conductivity @xcite .        since </S>",
    "<S> previous numerical studies have shown that the structure of graphene possesses self - affine properties @xcite , in this report , we show that iso - height lines , extracted at the percolation threshold , have a well - defined fractal dimension and are conformally invariant ( note that to obtain the percolation threshold one starts from the highest point of the membrane and systematically lowers down the height until a cluster , formed by carbon atoms bounded by covalent bonds to their neighbours , meets both opposite sides of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> this resulting height - threshold is the percolation threshold ) . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the observed statistical properties do not depend on the temperature of the samples . furthermore , by exploring the main differences between graphene sheets and self - affine rgs with the same hurst exponent , we have found that , even if they both have random uncorrelated phases in fourier space , the distributions of the modulus of the fourier coefficients are different . therefore , one can conclude that this distribution is important for conformal invariance , and opens a new way to construct self - affine surfaces that satisfy sle statistics . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the fact that the study of graphene can be placed within the theory of critical phenomena suggests that the interplay between thermal fluctuations and anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes induces a certain degree of criticality in graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> in this study , free standing graphene membranes are simulated using molecular dynamics with the adaptive intermolecular reactive bond - order ( airebo ) potential @xcite , which can describe graphene membranes accurately @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have imposed free boundary conditions and restricted the analysis of @xmath3 graphene membranes to the inner area @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> \\times \\big [ \\frac{l}{4},\\frac{3l}{4 }   \\big]$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed simulations of quadratic graphene membranes of length @xmath5   , @xmath6   , and @xmath7   , at different temperatures , i.e. @xmath8  k , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9  k , and @xmath10  k. a simulation time step of one fs was enough to capture the carbon - carbon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we let the samples evolve @xmath11  ns , @xmath12  ns , and @xmath13  ns , for system sizes @xmath7   , @xmath6   , and @xmath5   , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we control the temperature with a nos - hoover thermostat . </S>",
    "<S> each simulation starts with a flat graphene membrane located in the @xmath14 plane having small random perturbations in @xmath15-direction ( to break the symmetry ) and zero initial velocity ( zero temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> for each temperature and system size , we perform three independent simulations with different initial perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we use an equilibration time of @xmath16 ns to reach the desired temperature and verify that the respective maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the velocities is recovered ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 of the supplementary material ) . from each simulation </S>",
    "<S> , we extract graphene sheets in intervals of @xmath17  ps . following this procedure , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain for each temperature up to @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 graphene sheets for @xmath7   , @xmath6   , and @xmath5   , respectively .    in order to compare graphene membranes with rgs </S>",
    "<S> , we generate the latter ones by using the so - called fourier filtering method ( ffm ) . in contrary to graphene sheets , where simulations are performed in real space expressing physical interactions between atoms , rgs </S>",
    "<S> are constructed in fourier space , and can be designed to have a desired hurst exponent . in the ffm method </S>",
    "<S> , the fourier coefficients of rgs are constructed using the decomposition @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are standard gaussian random variables , the phase @xmath23 are uniformly random variables , and @xmath24 determines the hurst exponent @xmath25 via the relation @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by calculating the inverse fourier transform of @xmath27 , one gets the rgs .     </S>",
    "<S> k. inset : for different temperatures and a system size of @xmath7   . ]    using the thermalized graphene samples , we first compute the height - height correlation function , defined by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the height profile of the surface defined by the @xmath15 component of the atoms . for self - affine rough surfaces , </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath30 exhibits power - law behaviour , i.e. @xmath31 , where the hurst exponent @xmath25 characterises the roughness of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we take the statistical averages ( @xmath32 ) considering only carbon atoms that have a certain distance from the boundary to avoid boundary effects . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in fig .  [ fig : hurst ] indicate that within error bars the obtained hurst exponent @xmath33 is independent of both , system size and temperature , and is in agreement with the previous work by abedpour _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where it was found @xmath34 , even though they used different boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a hurst exponent confirms the self - affinity property of graphene membranes and thus sets our graphene sheets in the context of rough surfaces ( the measurement of the hurst exponent using the fourier space can be found in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 of the supplementary material ) . furthermore , knowing @xmath25 allows us to construct rgs with the same hurst exponent </S>",
    "<S> .    contour lines of self - affine surfaces exhibit scale invariance , as it is also the case for rgs @xcite . to verify this property </S>",
    "<S> , we extract the contour lines for each graphene sheet ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we have also measured the area enclosed by the contour lines in graphene membranes , finding that it also possesses a clear scaling exponent , i.e. @xmath42 ( see fig .  s4 of supplementary material ) .    to study conformal invariance in graphene membranes and rgs </S>",
    "<S> , we will use the sle theory . in this formalism , the fractal dimension @xmath35 of sle@xmath43 curves is related to the diffusion constant @xmath44 of a brownian walk obtained through a conformal map by @xcite : @xmath45 therefore to test the consistency of the iso - height contour lines with sle , one solves numerically the loewner differential equation that describes the conformal mapping @xcite , and compares the diffusivity @xmath44 of the driving function with the one computed using the fractal dimension and eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> we use the so - called slit map algorithm @xcite , to extract numerically the driving function @xmath46 , from which we obtain the diffusivity @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> if the random curves follow sle@xmath43 statistics , @xmath46 is a brownian motion of variance @xmath47 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::dsle_graphene_sheet ]  ( a ) , we plot the variance of the driving function for graphene at three different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it evolves linearly in time , and that the increments of the driving function are independent gaussian random variables . </S>",
    "<S> note that the results are independent of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate of @xmath48 predicts a fractal dimension of @xmath49 which does not differ significantly from the fractal dimension found for graphene @xmath50 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fd_graphene_and_rgs ] ) . from this , we conclude that although we do not have strong evidence that iso - height contour line in graphene are conformally invariant our results are in fair agreement with the sle formulation . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is strengthened through the left - passage probability test ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s5 of the supplementary material ) . on the other hand , for the case of rgs </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath51 ( see fig .  [ fig::dsle_graphene_sheet ]  ( b ) , which clearly disagrees with the diffusivity obtained from the fractal dimension using eq .   ( the expected value for @xmath44 is @xmath52 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a strong numerical evidence that the rgs are not sle .     for graphene at three different temperatures @xmath53  k , @xmath9  k , @xmath10  k. the solid line shows the linear dependence of the variance of the driving function with diffusivity @xmath54 . </S>",

    "<S> the winding angle @xmath62 between two points of the curve separated by a distance @xmath63 is defined as the oriented angle between the tangential vector of the curve at the first point and the vector connecting the two points . </S>",
    "<S> the winding angle distribution is expected to be gaussian of mean @xmath64 and variance @xmath65 where @xmath35 is the fractal dimension of the curves , and @xmath66 a constant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the variance of the winding angle , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq::winding_angle ] ) , gives a further numerical evidence for conformal invariance in graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have observed , not all rough self - affine surfaces satisfy sle statistics . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we are interested in understanding the origin of this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> since graphene sheets and rgs possess the same hurst exponent , we have extended our study to fourier space to seek for further information . </S>",
    "<S> we have taken the fourier transform of the graphene membranes and also of the rgs . by construction </S>",
    "<S> , the modulus of the fourier coefficients , @xmath74 , of rgs at each @xmath75 follows a gaussian distribution ( the modulus of the coefficients follows a folded normal distribution with zero mean unit variance ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , by performing the same measurement in graphene , we find a distribution that can be fitted with @xmath76 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : distribution_all](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we have also analysed the phase of the fourier coefficients , finding that in both cases , they can be considered , with good approximation , uniformly random ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : distribution_all](b ) ) and uncorrelated ( for rgs , the phases are uncorrelated by construction ) . for measuring correlations in the phase of the graphene membranes </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the autocorrelation function ( see fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> the fourier coefficients @xmath77 averaged over all graphene samples . ]    </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can conclude that the distribution of the modulus of the fourier coefficients in rough self - affine surfaces might play an important role in the conformal invariance of their iso - height lines at the percolation threshold , although it does not affect the fractal dimension . </S>",
    "<S> a similar connection between the distribution of the phase of the fourier coefficients and conformal invariance has already been observed for contour lines of zero - vorticity in 2d turbulence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have shown , that by randomizing the phase , the sle property disappears .    </S>",
    "<S> summarising , we have shown that the iso - height lines of graphene sheets at the percolation threshold are scale invariant and provided evidence that they might also be conformally invariant . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are independent of temperature ( within the range of @xmath8-@xmath10  k ) . additionally , they can be described by sle@xmath1 with @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> conformal invariance of the iso - height lines is not a property that all rough self - affine surfaces share , as is the case of rgs . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by further analysis of graphene surfaces and rgs , we have found that the distribution of the modulus of the fourier coefficients seems to be an important ingredient to guarantee this property . </S>",
    "<S> the modulus of the fourier coefficients reveals how much each mode contributes to the structure of the surface . from the distribution found in graphene sheets </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that there are more active modes compared to rgs . </S>",
    "<S> these additional modes can change the structure and the conformal invariance property .    </S>",
    "<S> this result provides insights on the long - standing question on which are the responsible properties for conformal invariance in self - affine surfaces , and can be used to construct self - affine surfaces with conformal invariance properties . additionally , the fact that iso - height lines in graphene are conformally invariant place the study of graphene within the theory of critical phenomena , belonging to a new universality class .    for an experimental verification of our findings </S>",
    "<S> we need the height profile of suspended graphene membranes . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is still challenging to measure the height profile of suspended graphene with an accuracy in the sub - angstrom regime with current methods , because they are generally not well applicable to suspended regions of a two - dimensional crystal ( due to its low binding rigidity ) . in the past few years , it has been possible to obtain the height profile of graphene grown on many different substrates , most commonly on sio@xmath79 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the substrates strongly influences the graphene membrane and thus changes its shape . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been possible to measure the height profile of suspended graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the technique used is still at an elementary stage and has to be improved in order to obtain sub - angstrom resolution . </S>",
    "<S> however , once this method is consolidated , we will be able to observe conformal invariance in experimental samples of graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , one can also explore if the scale and conformal invariance properties are typical for graphene or are present in other two - dimensional crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we have made tests on suspended silicene , a membrane made with silicon atoms , and unfortunately , we have found that it crumples ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s6 of the supplementary material ) , preventing us to perform the same analysis . </S>",
    "<S> however , further crystalline structures will be analysed in the future . </S>"
