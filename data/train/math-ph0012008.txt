    "the little group , or isotropy group , h@xmath3 of a component @xmath4 ( basis function )  of an irrep ( irreducible representation )  @xmath5 of a group g is the maximal symmetry group of this component .",
    "that is , it is the maximal subgroup of g  under each of whose elements this component is invariant .",
    "it is not necessary that the axis choices for g and h be identical .",
    "we define the little groups of @xmath6 as the set h@xmath7 of all possible symmetry groups of any single function or linear combination within this irreducible space .",
    "the inclusion of all linear combinations ensures that this set is independent of the choice of basis @xmath8 , making it relevant for all physical applications .",
    "applications of the little group concept cover the gamut of theoretical physics . in the group",
    "theoretical approach to symmetry breaking problems the symmetry of the solutions does not depend on the details of the governing equations .",
    "complete solutions will still require analysis of the governing equations , but the group theoretical selection rules may reduce the number of possibilities to a manageable number.in recent years it has been discussed in the physics literature in connection with internal symmetries in a relativistic theory ( e.g. landsman and wiedemann 1995 , kim 1996 , 1997 ) , lorentz - gauge potentials ( leaf 1998 ) , tachyons ( rembielinski 1997 ) , the pauli - lubanski spin vector ( nash 1997 ) , finding the higgs minima with the aid of little groups of the irreps of the gauge group ( girardi _ et al .",
    "_ 1982 ) , space groups ( e.g. jaric 1983a , jaric and senechal 1984 ) and aperiodic crystals ( konig and mermin 1997 ) .",
    "the landau theory is a cornerstone of our present understanding of second order phase transitions .",
    "the reason the landau theory is often qualitatively accurate , despite major quantitative approximations , is that it focuses on the exact symmetries involved in phase transitions .",
    "for example , the transition may only be second order when the system symmetry changes at the transition .",
    "landau s seminal hypothesis is that the thermodynamic potential of a system in the vicinity of a phase transition is a functional of the symmetry - breaking part of the relevant system density , namely the order parameter for the transition .",
    "since the expansion should provide a valid expression of the thermodynamic potential both above and below the transition , it must have at least as high a symmetry as the more symmetrical of the two phases .",
    "this is essentially an application of neumann s principle .",
    "since the transition occurs from the more symmetrical symmetry group ( say @xmath9 ) to a less symmetrical symmetry group ( say @xmath10 ) one may describe the system in terms of the irreps of @xmath9 .",
    "the order parameter belongs to the identity representation of @xmath10 but not to the identity representation of @xmath9 , and the little groups of the irreps of @xmath9 therefore play an important role ( jaric 1986 ) .",
    "a reduction of symmetry g @xmath11 h @xmath12 g is most appropriately quantified by an order parameter @xmath13 which has h for its little group . if @xmath13 corresponds to a single irrep @xmath5 of g , h is h@xmath14 as defined above .",
    "if we can specify @xmath13 as a particular basis function @xmath4 in the irrep space , h can be identified with h@xmath3 ; however in practice symmetry arguments alone are unlikely to give this further restriction .",
    "indeed the physics of the situation may rather require a reducible choice of @xmath13 , as discussed by birman ( 1982 ) .",
    "successful applications include superfluid he@xmath15 ( see vollhardt and wlfle 1990 for a comprehensive review ) .  in this case",
    "the symmetry breaking occurs from a seven parameter lie group that describes the spin angular momentum , orbital angular momentum and gauge symmetry of the cooper pairs that make up the superfluid .",
    "the little group technique successfully predicts all known superfluid phases of he@xmath15 and provides the starting point for any phenomenological theory of them .",
    "one interest of ours is in the optimal choice of symmetry of the order parameter for each of various liquid crystal phase transitions . because this interest includes isotropic to nematic liquid crystals , the little groups for irreps of o(3 )",
    "are of interest , as are those of so(3 ) for chiral systems .",
    "d@xmath1 in non - chiral systems and d@xmath0 in chiral systems are similarly of interest for liquid crystal transitions from smectic a to smectic c or to smectic b hexatic .",
    "analyses of the symmetry of order parameters in liquid crystal transitions have tended not to consider explicitly the effects of the reduction in point group symmetry of the orientational orderings , and have concentrated for example on such aspects as the breakdown of translational symmetry in the density wave of smectic liquid crystals .",
    "the little group concept has an important role in optimizing the description of the point group symmetry reduction basic to the onset of the various orientational orderings .",
    "this task requires a knowledge of the little groups of irreps of o(3 )  ( the symmetry of the isotropic phase from which the nematic transition occurs ) and of d@xmath16 ( the symmetry of the bond - orientational order in the nematic phase , to be broken by the further transitions ) .",
    "the appropriate choice of order parameter for each should reflect the nature of the symmetry being broken , both by being written in terms of the irreps of the higher symmetry phase and by having as little group the symmetry of the lower - symmetry phase .",
    "another application that we have in mind is to the determination of the symmetry of a system by ( for example ) experimental determination of its optical properties , both linear and nonlinear .",
    "it is known that the symmetry of a system may be ascertained to some degree from its spectra , and that the extent to which the symmetry can be pinned down varies with the technique used .",
    "there are several complications in the latter exercise .",
    "many sets of tables exist of the tensor components appropriate to ( for example )  phonon - assisted raman scattering ( e.g. loudon 1964 ) and second harmonic generation ( e.g. giordmaine 1965 , yariv and yeh 1984 ) . such tabulations note the nonzero and equivalent elements . based on a semiclassical approach , which has its own subtle inadequacies ( e.g. andrews _ _ et al.__1998 ) ,  these tables make many implicit and simplifying assumptions , such as the use of a singlet ground state .",
    "when the possibility of a degenerate ground state is considered in raman scattering , the optical properties of the system are considerably more complicated ( churcher and stedman 1981 ) .",
    "even the absorption spectrum of a low - symmetry system in a general linear polarisation can not be written as a linear combination of the spectra for @xmath17 linear polarisation , because the spectrum is of second order and requires cross terms in the amplitudes ( stedman 1985 ) .",
    "even so , these tables indicate that one may discriminate between ( for example )  c@xmath18 and d@xmath18 systems through their differing tensorial form in second harmonic generation .",
    "however if the requirement is foregone that the axes of reference are fixed and the question is asked whether two symmetries can be distinguished modulo a relative rotation , then little group analysis proves that many structures of different symmetry and with different property tensors behave identically .",
    "one powerful application of these results is to property tensors associated with certain optical effects ( see for example nye 1957 ) .",
    "it is useful for condensed matter or nonlinear optical experimenters to use tabulations by point group of the symmetry conditions on ligand field parameters ( newman 1971 ) , also the scattering tensors for such processes as phonon - assisted raman scattering ( loudon 1964 ) , second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation ( giordmaine 1965 )  etc . in establishing the non - zero and related elements of such tensors ,",
    "it is normal to assume a particular axis system .",
    "however many spectroscopic fitting techniques ( such as the fitting of the parameters in a crystal field hamiltonian to an observed energy level spectrum )  are ignorant of the coordinate system used in the theory , and are vulnerable to the associated introduction of unphysically high numbers of parameters .",
    "such results , familiar in the folklore of crystal field theory , can be put on a firmer foundation by recognising them as consequences of the identification of little groups for the relevant o(3 ) tensors .",
    "for example , in ligand field theory for a system of symmetry c@xmath19 inclusion of the parameter @xmath20 ( the coefficient of the corresponding tesseral harmonic @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23- )  in a level fitting program leads to indeterminancy in the fitting procedure , because its value is arbitrary in the sense that one may rotate the coordinates about the @xmath24 axis by any angle @xmath25 , changing the relative size of this parameter and @xmath26 ; hence a least squares fit becomes indefinite through the ambiguity in the choice of @xmath25 .",
    "one should define @xmath20 to be zero , as if the symmetry were d@xmath19 .",
    "section [ o3 ] gives a group - theoretic reason for this observation :  d@xmath19 and not c@xmath19 is a little group for @xmath27 ( the parity of a crystal field hamiltonian is positive since it acts within @xmath28 electron manifold ) , and the tensorial structure appropriate to d@xmath19 should therefore be used .",
    "the relationship of this ambiguity to the @xmath24 rotation is illustrated in section [ o3 ] as another example , systems of symmetry c@xmath18 and d@xmath18 can not be distinguished through second harmonic generation measurements , because the little groups appropriate to second harmonic generation ( corresponding to irreps 1@xmath29 , 2@xmath29 and 3@xmath29 ) include d@xmath18 and not c@xmath18 . again",
    "the physical reason is that the extra parameters which supposedly distinguish c@xmath18 from d@xmath18 can be removed by a suitable ( parameter - dependent ) rotation of the system , in this case an @xmath30 rotation to make the coefficient of say @xmath31 vanish .",
    "as another example , the dielectric tensor @xmath32 of a crystal usually has a higher symmetry than the point group g  suggests , being biaxial ( diagonal ) if g @xmath33 d@xmath34 , uniaxial ( diagonal and with @xmath35 ) if g @xmath36 d@xmath34 but g @xmath33 d@xmath37and isotropic otherwise .",
    "the reason is conspicuous from section [ o3 ] ; such a symmetric even - parity second rank tensor must transform as @xmath38 under so(3 ) , and the relevant little groups o(3 ) , d@xmath1 and d@xmath34 dictate the optimal form of the tensor , once a suitable rotation ( in this case diagonalising the matrix )  is applied .",
    "it is not guaranteed that the axes of the dielectric tensor coincide with any of the crystal axes .",
    "the same mathematics may be applied to justify the manner in which the moment of inertia tensor of undergraduate physics can be represented by an ellipsoid of revolution , even for objects with far less ( and even no ) symmetry , when principal axes are chosen suitably .    in the applied mathematics literature",
    ", two applications of the little group concept are to buckling problems and to rayleigh - bnard instabilities in thermal convection ( ihrig and golubitsky 1984 ) .",
    "many problems in bifurcation theory ( e.g. keller 1969 ) have the property that when a bifurcation occurs in a stationary problem the symmetry of the solution is a subgroup of that of the ground state .",
    "consequently , this sort of problem often involves finding symmetry breaking solutions to a system of non - linear partial differential equations .",
    "the spherical bnard problem forms an example of such a bifurcation problem .  it may involve the steady states in the buckling of an elastic spherical shell ( like a red blood cell ) or convection of a viscous fluid confined between two concentric spherical shells ( like the magma between the crust and the core of the earth )",
    "it has been successfully approached via the liapunov schmidt reduction ( sattinger 1978 ) , which is contingent upon knowledge of the little groups of o(3 ) ( ihrig and golubitsky 1984 ) .",
    "a similar situation is that of finding the equilibrium of a rotating self - gravitating fluid .",
    "the relevant equations depend on the square of the angular momentum",
    ".  consequently they and their unbifurcated solutions ( known as maclaurin ellipsoids ) are invariant under the group d@xmath1 .",
    "the first symmetry breaking solutions were found by jacobi ( 1834 ) and are known as the jacobi ellipsoids ( symmetry group d@xmath34 ) .",
    "poincar ( 1885 ) made further contributions .",
    "it was not until relatively recently ( constantinescu 1979 ) that complete ( infinite ) solutions were found for bifurcations from both the maclaurin and jacobi ellipsoids using the little groups of d@xmath1 and d@xmath34 respectively .",
    "the results presented here are therefore of immediate interest in the landau theory of liquid crystal phase transitions and in the identification of molecular symmetries from their spectra .",
    "however they are of far more general application , as indicated above .",
    "several authors have investigated the little groups of the rotation group so(3 ) .",
    "no fully reliable algorithm for determining the little groups of o(3 ) or so(3 )  has previously been reported .",
    "listings have been made of the little groups of the irreps ( @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) of o(3 ) .",
    "in many subsequent works , a chain criterion has been the central consideration .",
    "such criteria have been discussed extensively ( birman 1966 , goldrich and birman 1968 , cracknell _ et al .",
    "_ 1976 , boccara 1973 , lorenc _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 , birman 1982 , jaric 1982 , przystawa 1982 , gaeta 1990 ) .",
    "this chain criterion has passed through several modifications in the literature , and the little group listing alters with each modification .",
    "problems in the analysis of boccara ( 1973 ) , for example , are mentioned in appendix 1 .      a systematic determination of the little groups of so(3 )",
    "was made by michel ( 1980 ) .",
    "he used a form of the chain criterion ( his lemma 2 ) except in the case of all cyclic groups , where little groups were determined by inspection .",
    "the present work gives two small corrections to michel s list .",
    "first , so(3 ) is only trivially a little group for a non - identity irrep .",
    "second , michel s identification of d@xmath42 as a little group for @xmath43 is incorrect .",
    "this indicates an inadequacy in his chain criterion .",
    "the aim of the present work is to find an approach that generates the correct little groups and to extend the analysis to find the most general vector in the group representation space for a given little group , generalising these results to cover irreps of the full rotation group o(3 ) .",
    "michel notes that this is trivial in the case of positive parity representations if one knows the results for so(3 ) .",
    "this is because the full rotation group is an outer direct product group ; o@xmath44so@xmath45z@xmath46z@xmath47so@xmath48 where z@xmath42 denotes the parity ( inversion ) group .",
    "thus , if a representation belongs to the identity irrep of z@xmath42 , its little groups will simply be the direct product of z@xmath42 with the relevant so(3 ) little groups .  in the case of negative parity",
    "no such simple prescription exists as improper operations may still be present ( as in the intrinsic symmetry of a true vector such as the electric field , the symmetry of which is c@xmath2 ) .    in his lemma 2 and table aii michel ( 1980 ) used a group subduction criterion which may be rephrased in the following form .",
    "if h is to be a little group of an orthogonal irrep @xmath6 , for a strictly larger intermediate subgroup h@xmath49 such that h@xmath12h@xmath50 g , and in particular for a group h@xmath49 adjacent to h in this group coupling chain , then @xmath51 in this equation @xmath52 is the subduction frequency for h in @xmath5(g ) , namely the number of occurrences of the identity irrep @xmath53 in @xmath54 ; it is readily determined from the weyl trace formula @xmath55(h ) @xmath56 .    from the above chain criterion the largest group h that has a particular @xmath57h@xmath58 is the little group of that particular linear combination of basis functions .  if one moves from a little group to the next group up the group chain then the value of @xmath57h@xmath58 decreases because that increase in symmetry removes one or more of the basis functions that were allowed at the lower symmetry .",
    "the little group is then the maximal symmetry of some linear combination of basis functions .",
    "a simple illustration of the application of this chain criterion is given in appendix 1 , where the tables give the group - subgroup branching relations needed for the use of the chain criterion for the 32 crystallographic point groups and also for other groups of interest in our applications .",
    "the entries are the subduction frequencies , or number of times the invariant 0(h ) occurs in @xmath5(g ) .",
    "equation ( [ michel ] ) is a useful necessity condition for h to be a little group .",
    "jaric ( 1982 ) noted the failure of the chain criterion to be sufficient for a lie group .",
    "there are two reasons for the lack of sufficiency . even for finite groups equation ( [ michel ] )",
    "can fail to be a sufficiency condition , because multiple group - subgroup coupling chains connecting h@xmath49 and h need special consideration .",
    "in addition , the little group is the _ maximal _ symmetry group its symmetry elements do not have to share the axes of the same elements in the parent group .",
    "every function in the basis set can have its own orientation relative to the supergroup axes .",
    "for example , c@xmath59 is not a little group of 1@xmath60o(3 ) ) in spite its conformity to this chain criterion .",
    "the conformity is shown because the vector irrep 1@xmath61 branches twice to 0@xmath62 , once more than in any of its supergroups c@xmath63",
    "@xmath64 c@xmath65 , c@xmath34 , c@xmath66 , c@xmath67 which are maximally connected ( i.e. which have no intervening group in the chain ) .",
    "however these numbers reflect the fact that all the components are tied to the same choice of rotation axes and mirror plane .",
    "when the axis choice can be tailored individually to the basis functions their symmetry is seen to be much higher than this , and in fact the little group of the functions in 1@xmath68 is uniquely c@xmath2 , the intrinsic symmetry group of any polar vector . as another example , @xmath69so@xmath70 reduces to more invariants in the maximal subgroup c@xmath42 of d@xmath42 than it does in d@xmath42 itself ; again more invariants appear at c@xmath71 level . however c@xmath71 and c@xmath42 are not little groups of @xmath69so@xmath70 . the ( real and orthogonal )  basis functions @xmath72 , @xmath73  in @xmath74 both have d@xmath42symmetry , but about different axes .",
    "in addition , their linear combination has no 2-fold symmetry about an axis in the same plane ; yet it has d@xmath42symmetry about oblique axes .",
    "these examples show that the symmetries of all these functions can not be tested at once within a global choice of axes by counting the increases in the number @xmath55 of invariants as the symmetry is lowered simply by removing group elements relative to those axes .",
    "an approach is needed in which bases are allowed to be fully flexible so as to investigate the maximal symmetry of any function .",
    "in particular , michel ( 1980 ) was incorrect to assign d@xmath42 as a little group of @xmath43 under so(3 ) ( see appendix 1 ) .",
    "michel ( 1980 ) left the parthian challenge : `` we leave to the reader the study of the representations 1- '' .",
    "the challenge was taken up by ihrig and golubitsky ( 1984 ) .",
    "their work is the most sophisticated to date and has been accepted by subsequent workers as the definitive result .",
    "ihrig and golubitsky ( 1984 ) observe : `` unfortunately , michel s criterion for determining when a subgroup is actually an isotropy subgroup ( lemma 2 ) is incorrect as stated , ''  and `` in section 5 we give a correct version of this lemma .",
    "see lemma 5.3 . its proof is involved .",
    "it seems likely that the condition we give is both necessary and sufficient though we have not been able to prove this . ''",
    "our results show that their lemma 5.3 is necessary but not sufficient for the group o(3 ) , and not all their identifications are correct .    initially",
    ", ihrig and golubitsky ( 1984 ) undertake to find the maximal little groups of o(3 ) , stating : `` it is harder for a system to break more symmetries than less . ''",
    "this , the so - called maximality conjecture , has been part of the folklore of phase transition and gauge field theory for twenty years .",
    "its general applicability was disproved by jaric ( 1983b ) .",
    "ihrig and golubitsky ( 1984 ) then embark on the task of finding all of the little groups of o(3 ) , a task described as `` a much more difficult calculation '' .",
    "ihrig and golubitsky s ( 1984 )  central result , proposition 5.3 , is another refinement of the chain criterion . rather than depending on an increase in the total subduction frequency , ihrig and golubitsky propose that the following inequality must be satisfied in a h@xmath49 @xmath75 h if h is to be a little group of @xmath6 :    @xmath76    in this the following definitions are used .",
    "as above , @xmath77(g ) ( which ihrig and golubitsky write as @xmath78 )  is the subduction frequency for the group g in the vector @xmath79 , namely the number of occurrences of the identity irrep @xmath80(g ) in the set @xmath79 . in the case of @xmath55 @xmath81 , the set of basis functions of the irrep @xmath82 .",
    "the normaliser @xmath83 of any h @xmath12 g is the largest subgroup of @xmath9 that contains @xmath10 as an invariant subgroup :  @xmath84 ( see fraleigh 1994 ) .  for k @xmath12h , @xmath85 for a group ,",
    "@xmath86 g is the lie group dimension of the manifold of g , namely the number of infinitesimal generators in g. because we deal only with subgroups of o(3 ) , @xmath86 g @xmath87 if g @xmath88 o(3 ) or so(3 ) , @xmath86 g @xmath89 if g is one of the infinite axial groups , and @xmath86 g @xmath90 if g is a finite group .",
    "the normaliser of a finite subgroup of o(3 ) is usually also a finite group and so of dimension zero .",
    "the exceptions are the normalizers of any of the abelian subgroups of o(3 ) .",
    "any subgroup of an abelian group is an invariant subgroup , so that the normaliser of any abelian subgroup of o(3 ) will always contain c@xmath0 and will thus always be one - dimensional .",
    "this refinement of the chain criterion by ihrig and golubitsky ( 1984 ) , introducing the dimensions of the normalisers , shows cognisance of the basic problems with the michel criterion , and is closer to a sufficiency condition .",
    "the differences are discussed in sections [ mass ] , [ o3 - 2 ] and appendix 1 .",
    "we note here that the little groups of so(3 ) generated by their method mostly agree with michel ( 1980 ) , including the erroneous assignment of d@xmath42 in @xmath43 ; they disagree with michel ( 1980 )  by assigning o and not t  as a little group of @xmath43 ; these changes are retrograde as erroneous . for positive parity irreps of o(3 ) ,",
    "their results are completely incorrect ; none of the groups they list are little groups . for negative parity irreps in o(3 )",
    "their results are not consistently presented . on the most favourable rationalisation of this problem",
    ", they are incorrect in assigning t as a little group in @xmath91 .",
    "hence equation ( [ ig1 ] ) is not sufficient .",
    "we introduce now a modified criterion which we call the massive chain criterion ; we find it to be fully reliable as a sufficiency as well as necessity condition within subgroups of g = o(3 ) .",
    "this criterion states that h @xmath12 g is a little group of an orthogonal irrep @xmath82 if and only if for each strictly larger and adjacentgroup h@xmath49 ( so that h @xmath12 h@xmath92 g ) , _  _ _  _    @xmath93    here we call @xmath94 the massless subduction frequency ; it will be defined below .",
    "@xmath95 redeems the failure of earlier chain criteria to recognise adequately that the shape of a basis function is independent of any o(3 ) rotation , and that the attendant freedom of its axis choice has to be taken into account in determining whether it is an invariant  with respect to any potential little group h. comparing equations ( [ mcc1 ] ) , ( [ michel ] ) and ( [ ig1 ] ) , we note that the massless subduction frequency @xmath94 plays the role of ihrig and golubitsky s correction term @xmath96 in refining the michel criterion .",
    "we shall illustrate that @xmath97(h ) can differ from @xmath98 by more than a constant even in subgroups of o(3 ) .",
    "another practical difference with both michel ( 1980 ) and with ihrig and golubitsky ( 1984 )  is the emphasis on checking the criterion in each possible coupling chain h@xmath99 h. _ _  _ _ this is an important check when there are multiple chains , to avoid h being credited with little group character when that application should really be to some higher group .",
    "this explains at least some of the explicit errors in earlier work .",
    "let @xmath100 be the subset of  functions in @xmath101 ( a set of orthogonal functions forming a basis of @xmath102 ) that are invariant under h. the basis is chosen to maximise the number of functions in the subset @xmath100 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath101 is therefore @xmath55 , the number of occurrences of 0@xmath103 in @xmath5 . at this stage",
    "no transformations of g may be applied to demonstrate such an h - invariance ; the basis functions , once chosen , are fixed and elements of g that are retained in its subgroup h have unchanged orientations .",
    "we now define the massless subduction frequency by determining the extent to which the members of @xmath104h ) are in fact equivalent under transformations of g. we partition @xmath100 into two sets , a ` massless ' subset @xmath105 and a ` massive ' subset @xmath106 , so that each member of @xmath105 when transformed by a suitable element of g is identical to some member of @xmath107 .",
    "the partition is made so as to maximise the dimension @xmath94 of @xmath108 within the irrep @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , g - equivalent functions in @xmath101 are separated , one being partitioned off to @xmath105 until no two members of @xmath106 are identical under a transformation of g. @xmath106 contains one and only one of each of the shapes represented by the members of @xmath109 ; @xmath105 contains any duplicate shapes ( functions which are equivalent under g transformation ) .",
    "this defines the ` massless subduction frequency ' @xmath94 .",
    "the massive subduction frequency is the dimension @xmath110 of @xmath106 , and is therefore given by @xmath111    the terms ` massless ' and ` massive ' are chosen in analogy with higgs theory ( see for example weinberg 1996 ) where a unitarity transformation ( the analogue of the g operations above , and in particular to rotations for so(3 ) )  removes the basis functions of the gauge group that correspond to massless particles .",
    "the analogy is particularly close when little groups are applied to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "only massive components contribute to the homogeneous hamiltonian .",
    "the massless components become important in the inhomogeneous part of the hamiltonian because they give rise to goldstone modes , and the number of goldstone modes must equal the number of massless components .    with these definitions , equation ( [ mcc1 ] )",
    "then gives@xmath112when this inequality holds , a new shape ( characterised independently of its orientation )  has appeared , and because it is invariant under h  and not under any supergroup h@xmath49 its symmetry is h. this is the condition for h to be a little group of @xmath113 . by construction , then , equation ( [ mcc1 ] ) takes fully into account the complications in the subduction formula caused by the freedom of axis choice .",
    "we now search for an algorithm to calculate the massless subduction frequency @xmath94 in subgroups of g = o(3 ) and so(3 ) .",
    "first , the value of @xmath94 is limited by the need to have at least one massive function , @xmath114 within a finite subspace @xmath101 of dimension @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 ) .",
    "hence @xmath117 , which is @xmath118 in the irrep @xmath39(o(3 ) ) .",
    "the next aspect is the extent to which linearly independent functions can be generated from any basis function while respecting h symmetries .",
    "the general rule for this pays particular attention to the degrees of freedom of the group ; linear independence is then possible because of the continuous value of the possible rotation ( ihrig and golubitsky 1984 ) .",
    "there are three cases to consider .",
    "we summarise the results here ; illustrations of such points are discussed in the next section .    first ,",

    "however , before one can conclude that h@xmath231 is a little group , it needs to be verified that a linear combination of basis functions has no further symmetries which are generated by the linear combination , and that its symmetries are exhibited only by a suitable axis rotation .    as an example , consider linear combinations in @xmath227 .",

    "some of the subtler points in implementing this are exemplified by reid and butler ( 1982 ) .",
    "the program racah was used to confirm the symmetry of some more complicated basis functions . while this approach restricted as above to a subset of axis choices and",

    "as noted below , this argument does not work in the cases @xmath245 .",

    "ihrig and golubitsky ( 1984 ) augment the trace formula and correctly generate subduction frequencies for groups such as c@xmath127 for arbitrary values of @xmath164 .  for this presentation",
    "we proceed partly via inspection as deployed initially by ihrig and golubitsky in the groups c@xmath0 and c@xmath127 and then apply the massive chain criterion .",
    "the dimension of the fixed point set must be unity for c@xmath0 because there is just one tesseral harmonic basis function , @xmath376 that is invariant under infinitesimal rotations about an axis .  from our earlier discussion the subduction frequency for c@xmath0 must be equal to the massive subduction frequency ( i.e. unity ) .",
    "furthermore , as ihrig and golubitsky also observe , the fixed point set for the group c@xmath127 will include all basis functions where @xmath164 divides @xmath377 .",

    "the preceding results with the massive chain criterion ( section [ mass ] ) produce the complete set of results for the little groups of so(3 ) in table 1 .",
    "the basis functions for the groups t , o and y are not as simply stated ; only particular combinations of the tesseral harmonic basis functions have the requisite symmetry .",
    "they may be determined for any particular case by using the program ` racah ` ( appendix 3 ) . in this sense group branching arguments fully accommodate the effects of axis freedom .",
    "we now consider little groups of irreps of o(3 ) .",
    "the results for positive parity irreps are trivially derived from the little groups of so(3 ) ( see caption to table 2 ) ; the subduction frequencies and representation vectors are exactly the same for these irreps .",
    "the case of negative parity may be attacked in exactly the same way as that of positive parity .",
    "the only caution applies to finding the general vectors for cases such as d@xmath127 where one must again be sure that the two fold axes of different basis functions coincide .",
    "also , one must be sure that basis functions that are included in the fixed point set do actually possess the requisite symmetry .",
    "for example , the group d@xmath347 does not contain d@xmath296 ; the supergroups of d@xmath126 are d@xmath385 where @xmath386 is any odd positive integer .",
    "the cases of d@xmath125 , c@xmath125 and s@xmath127 are similar .",
    "the results for @xmath387 are given in table 2 .",
    "in our choice of basis we follow the convention ( see section [ l=3 ] ) in which the massless components that are eliminated are those with @xmath388 and one of the smallest @xmath389 possible where necessary ( often @xmath390- ) .",
    "the group o@xmath123 is maximally connected to o(3 ) ; there are no subgroups of o(3 ) that are supergroups of o@xmath123 .",
    "it follows that o@xmath123 will be a little group for any irrep that subduces its identity more that zero times ( except the identity irrep @xmath391 ) .",
    "the same is true of the group y@xmath123 .  in the case of the groups",
    "o , y and t@xmath124 one may note that they are only connected to o(3 ) via inversion supergroups .",
    "it follows that since these non - inversion groups can only be little groups of negative parity irreps and since inversion groups are always subduced zero times by negative parity irreps , that they will be little groups for any negative parity irrep @xmath39 , @xmath387 for which @xmath392  since the subduction frequency is partly a periodic function and partly a linear function , the largest value of @xmath228 for which the subduction frequency could be zero is obtained by comparing the linear part to the largest negative value generated by the periodic part ) .",
    "this gives the little groups in the first 5 rows of of table 2 .",
    "the cases of t@xmath123 for positive parity and t for negative parity require a further observation .",
    "suppose for some irrep of a group @xmath9 there exist at least two little groups : @xmath393 and @xmath394 .",
    "further suppose that @xmath393 and @xmath394 are not group  subgroup related .",
    "it follows that at least one of the massive components of the most general representation vector with little group @xmath393 must be different from that with little group @xmath394 .",
    "the representation vector that subduces the identity representation of any subgroup of @xmath393 must contain all of the components of the representation vector that subduces the identity of @xmath393 .",
    "the same is true for any subgroup of @xmath394 .",
    "now consider a group @xmath395 that is a subgroup of both @xmath393 and @xmath394 .",
    "it follows immediately that the massive subduction frequency of @xmath395 must be strictly greater than that of either @xmath393 or @xmath394 ( whichever is the larger ) .",
    "hence @xmath395 must also be a little group of @xmath9 for the irrep under consideration .",
    "this means that both t@xmath123 ( supergroups y@xmath123 and o@xmath123 ) and t ( supergroups y , o and t@xmath124 ) must be little groups for all @xmath39 ( respectively positive and negative parity ) greater than or equal to thirty .  since the subduction frequencies given above must be the massive subduction frequencies for these groups ( which have non - collinear axes ) it is a simple matter to apply the massive chain criterion for all @xmath228 less than thirty .",

    "since any linear combination of these functions has the d@xmath42 rotational symmetry which they share , this is the minimum rotational symmetry in @xmath227 .",
    "in addition these functions ( with even @xmath157 ) have compatible reflection symmetries , so that in the case of even parity a general linear combination has d@xmath34 symmetry .    if @xmath455 , then in addition , either @xmath456 or @xmath457 , i.e. only a 3-fold rotation can evade the necessity of requiring @xmath458 . since a 2-fold and 3-fold rotation are not compatible , it is impossible to avoid imposing at least 3 conditions on @xmath459 and @xmath460 ( 3 rather than 4 , because of the possibility of using the third euler angle to cancel the fourth ) ; and so it is impossible for a general linear combination at @xmath43 to have a nontrivial rotational symmetry .",
    "however , the symmetry of a general linear combination of the full basis set @xmath461 can be simplified by an appropriate axis choice to restrict the number of functions under consideration to @xmath462 with the free choice of one linear relation between the coefficients @xmath463 , @xmath464 ( for example @xmath465 ) .",
    "since the reflection symmetries of @xmath466 ( where @xmath157 is odd )  are incompatible with those of the other functions ( with even @xmath157 ) , no reflection plane can survive in general in the case @xmath455 . hence c@xmath119 and c@xmath71 are the maximal symmetries of a general linear form and and so little groups for positive and negative parity respectively for @xmath455 .",
    "this proceeds similarly for higher @xmath228 ; for @xmath22 we can consider a general linear combination as a combination of @xmath467 with the coefficient of one of the @xmath468 functions being set to zero .",
    "special functions and their little groups at @xmath22 include equation ( [ oh ] ) for o  and at @xmath469 include y@xmath470 o@xmath471 t@xmath472 @xmath473    since the little groups of positive parity irreps are determined purely by their rotational symmetry we need only consider pure rotations in using the inspection method .  the tesseral harmonic basis functions in 3@xmath274 have the following symmetries ( confirmed by the program ` racah ` ) : @xmath335 : c@xmath1 , @xmath474 : c@xmath34 , @xmath336 : t@xmath123 , @xmath466 : d@xmath328 .",
    "a general linear combination of @xmath475 with @xmath476 will always have the same symmetry as @xmath477 for the reasons discussed in section [ strategy ] .",
    "we may now consider all possible linear combinations of the above .",
    "this is essentially a combinatorial exercise although we use the fact that it is always possible to remove @xmath478 and one other function with @xmath199 , say @xmath479  by performing the appropriate rotation .",
    "the results are as follows :  @xmath480 : c@xmath481 @xmath482 : c@xmath483 @xmath484 : c@xmath481 @xmath485 : c@xmath486 @xmath487 : c@xmath119 .",
    "in short , the massive chain criterion finds all possible little groups .",
    "the massive subduction frequency also gives the number of massive components of the most general representation vector that has a particular little group .",
    "the vectors which are appropriate for different @xmath228 , h are indicated in tables 1,2 .",
    "the convention by which the massless components are removed is that of section [ l=3 ] , [ gen ] . according to the above we",
    "could have chosen @xmath488 as the vector for c@xmath34 instead of @xmath489 .",
