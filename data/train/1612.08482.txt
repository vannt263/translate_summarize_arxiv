    "since the quantum number _ strangeness _ was introduced @xcite and the first observation of @xmath4 hypernuclei @xcite in 1953 , strangeness nuclear physics has always been at the frontier of experimental and theoretical nuclear physics . in recent years , open questions such as the charge symmetry breaking in @xmath5",
    "@xmath4-hypernuclei @xcite and the existence of h - dibaryon @xcite have attracted a lot of attention  @xcite . in facilities like j - parc in japan and",
    "fair in germany , many important studies are being pursued , e.g. , the level spectra and decay properties of @xmath4 , double @xmath4 and @xmath6 hypernuclei @xcite , the @xmath7 scattering @xcite , and the final state interactions in production reactions , such as @xmath8 @xcite , which can provide information on the @xmath9 scattering lengths .",
    "meanwhile , theoretical few- and many - body calculations of hypernuclei have made steady progress , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "one particularly interesting ongoing issue is about the role of hyperons in the core of neutron stars , known as the _ hyperon puzzle _ : nuclear many - body calculations incorporating hyperon degrees of freedom  @xcite have difficulties obtaining a two - solar mass neutron star that was recently observed  @xcite .    as the most important theoretical input for few- and many - body calculations , baryon - baryon interactions play an indispensable role in studies of hypernuclear physics .",
    "although many efforts have been made to derive them , previous theoretical investigations were mainly based on phenomenological meson - exchange models @xcite and quark models @xcite . in the past two decades",
    ", two breakthroughs have occurred in constructing model - independent baryon - baryon interactions , and both of them are more closely related to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the underlying theory of strong interactions .",
    "one is lattice qcd simulations @xcite , which provide an _ ab initio _ numerical solution to qcd from first principles . with the ever - growing of computing power and evolving numerical algorithms ,",
    "lattice qcd simulations are approaching the physical world @xcite , thus providing us with more information and constraints on baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "the other is chiral effective field theory ( @xmath10eft ) , which has achieved great successes in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) interactions @xcite following weinberg s proposal  @xcite .",
    "the latter approach has been generalized to antinucleon - nucleon @xcite , hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath12 ) @xcite and multi - strangeness systems @xcite . the main advantage of @xmath10eft is that by using a power counting scheme , one can improve calculations systematically by going to higher orders in powers of external momenta and light quark masses , and estimating the uncertainties of any given order .",
    "furthermore , three- and four - body forces automatically arise as we push through the hierarchy of chiral forces .    however , the weinberg approach for baryon - baryon interaction is based on a non - relativistic formalism .",
    "it suffers from high sensitivities to ultraviolet cutoffs , that is , renormalization group invariance is violated , risking severe model dependence of short - range physics .",
    "various opinions on this issue can be found in refs .",
    "in two recent papers , epelbaum and gegelia have proposed a new approach ( referred to as the eg approach in the present letter ) to @xmath11 scattering in @xmath10eft @xcite , where the time - ordered perturbation theory is employed and relativistic effects are partially retained . at leading order ( lo ) ,",
    "the potential remains unchanged but the scattering equation changes to the kadyshevsky equation , compared to the lippmann - schwinger equation with nonrelativistic nucleon propagators in the weinberg approach .",
    "although this turned out to improve the description of the nijmegen partial wave analysis ( pwa ) @xcite , a higher order contact term was still needed in @xmath13 partial wave to achieve renormalization group invariance .",
    "we applied the eg approach to the strangeness @xmath0 @xmath12 system @xcite and found that the best description of the experimental data is quantitatively similar to that of the weinberg approach , and that cutoff dependence is mitigated but not removed .",
    "partly motivated by the successes of covariant @xmath10eft in the one - baryon and heavy - light systems @xcite , a new covariant power counting is proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study @xmath11 chiral interactions .",
    "the covariant treatment of baryons maintains all the symmetries and analyticities , and , at lo , it results in a more efficient scheme in the sense that it requires fewer low energy constants ( lecs ) to achieve similar accuracy , in comparison with the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) weinberg scheme .",
    "in the present letter , we apply this scheme to @xmath12 scattering with strangeness @xmath0 .",
    "given the fact that experimental data are scarce in the @xmath12 sectors , a more efficient formulation of baryon - baryon forces with fewer lecs is particularly relevant .",
    "in the covariant power counting  @xcite , the full baryon spinor is retained to maintain lorentz invariance @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 , while a non - relativistic reduction of @xmath17 is employed in the weinberg approach .    according to naive dimensional analysis ,",

    "the infrared enhancement in two - baryon propagations gives the theoretical argument for low - energy baryon - baryon interactions to be nonperturbative  @xcite . as a result",
    ", one needs to iterate the potentials in the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "in practice this is difficult .",
    "one often utilizes a three - dimension reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the coupled - channel kadyshevsky equation : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the total energy of the baryon - baryon system in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath86 is the relativistic on - shell momentum defined by @xmath87 , with @xmath88 and @xmath89 intermediate state baryons , and @xmath90 is the reduced mass of the intermediate state . the labels @xmath91 denote the particle channels , and @xmath92 denote the partial waves .",

    "the kadyshevsky equation is solved in particle basis in order to properly account for the physical thresholds and the coulomb force in charged channels .",
    "the latter is treated with the vincent - phatak method  @xcite .",
    "in our approach , there are 12 lecs that need to be pinned down by fitting to the 36 @xmath12 scattering data as done in  @xcite , which consist of 35 cross sections  @xcite and a @xmath95 inelastic capture ratio at rest  @xcite .    due to the poor quality of experimental data , it is customary to consider the hypertriton @xmath96h binding energy @xcite as a further constraint , which is crucial in fixing the relative strength of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 contributions to @xmath97 scattering .",
    "however , we are unable to perform a 3-body calculation at present , so we use as benchmarks the @xmath97 @xmath98 -wave scattering lengths extracted in the lo  @xcite and next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite calculations using the weinberg approach , mainly because they combine to describe very well the hypertriton  @xcite .",
    "empirically , the @xmath97 @xmath35 contribution is more sensitive to the scattering data while the @xmath34 part is mainly decided by the hypertriton binding energy @xcite .",
    "in addition , it seems necessary that @xmath99 should be neither smaller nor too larger than @xmath100 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "another constraint that should be considered is the @xmath7 @xmath35 scattering length .",
    "a repulsive @xmath101 interaction with isospin @xmath102 is obtained from recent experiments  @xcite . and",
    "the conventional @xmath103-matrix calculations @xcite indicate that the @xmath35 partial wave for @xmath102 @xmath101 should be at least moderately repulsive , therefore in out fits we require a positive @xmath104 .",
    "previous works in @xmath10eft  @xcite showed that the optimum cutoff @xmath105 may be around 600 mev .",
    "therefore we first tentatively fix @xmath105 at @xmath106 mev . with this cutoff",

    "best fits within @xmath113 mev yield similar scattering lengths . in the results presented below ,",
    "we fix @xmath114 fm and @xmath115 fm .",
    "given the fact that most phenomenological studies seem to prefer a larger scattering length in this channel .",
    "] it should be noted that at present we could in principle choose other combinations within the uncertainties allowed in the best fits . to fix them uniquely ,",
    "more experimental inputs are needed .",
    "we have made an attempt at the combined fit to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 data , in which strict su(3 ) symmetry was imposed upon the contact terms so that no additional lecs are needed .",
    "however , we failed to describe the @xmath11 and @xmath12 data simultaneously .",
    "as a result , consistent with previous nlo results in the weinberg approach  @xcite , we conclude that one needs to treat more carefully the su(3 ) symmetry breaking in order to simultaneously describe both the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 systems in @xmath10eft .",
    "with the three additional constraints @xmath115 fm , @xmath114 fm and @xmath116 as explained above , we perform a fit to the 36 scattering data while varying the cutoff @xmath105 .",

    "the best fitted lecs obtained with @xmath119 mev are listed in table [ tab_lecs600 ] .",
    "since the lecs in the @xmath97 @xmath34 partial wave can not be uniquely determined as mentioned previously , we only show a typical case here .",
    "one should note that these lecs are certain combinations of those appearing in the lagrangians , and hence they are not necessarily of the same order of magnitude ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "our value is about 350 mb , which is smaller than the two phenomenological models .",
    "our result in the @xmath122 reaction is similar to the lo weinberg approach and nsc97f results , but quite different from the jlich 04 model .",
    "this channel can partially reflect the nature of @xmath1 coupling , which is crucial in hypernuclear structure calculations  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the jlich 04 model predicts an overbound @xmath4 single particle potential @xmath123 in @xmath103-matrix calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the results from the former two are much closer to the empirical value , c.f . @xcite and references therein .",
    "one should note that the improved description of the scattering data by the covariant @xmath10eft scheme for the most part arises from the contact terms . in the lo weinberg approach",
    ", contact terms only appear in central and spin - spin potentials without momentum dependence , which only contribute to the @xmath34 and @xmath35 partial waves . in the covariant",
    "power counting , tensor , spin - orbit , asymmetric spin - orbit and quadratic spin - orbit terms appear at lo in addition to the central and spin - spin terms of the weinberg approach , namely the momentum dependent terms of @xmath124 in eqs .",
    "( [ ctp1]-[ctp8 ] ) .",
    "these terms are responsible for the improved description . meanwhile ,",
    "relativistic corrections in the one - pseudoscalar - meson - exchange potentials contribute very little .",
    "these are similar to the @xmath11 sector .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in ref .",
    "we have studied strangeness @xmath125 hyperon - nucleon scattering at leading order in a covariant framework of chiral effective field theory .",
    "starting from the covariant chiral lagrangian , the small components of the baryon spinors are retained in deriving the potentials in order to preserve lorentz invariance .",
    "strict su(3 ) symmetry is imposed upon contact terms , which yield 12 independent low energy constants .",
    "su(3 ) symmetry is broken in the one - pseudoscalar - meson - exchange potentials because of the mass difference of exchanged mesons .",
    "the potentials are iterated using the kadyshevsky equation .",
    "a quite satisfactory description of the 36 hyperon - nucleon scattering data is obtained and the cutoff dependence is shown to be mitigated , both of which are comparable with the next - to - leading order weinberg approach .",
    "however , the latter has 11 more low energy constants .",
    "the relativistic interaction obtained is shown to be more efficient than the weinberg approach and may provide essential inputs to relativistic hypernuclear structure studies .",
