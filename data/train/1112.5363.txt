    "a large number of satellites of asteroids have been discovered since the discovery of the satellite dactyl , thanks to the galileo flyby of ( 243 ) ida ( @xcite ) . as of today",
    ", there is 206 known systems ( binary , triple and quintuple ) , following the johnston s archive online database ( see also the online database described by @xcite and @xcite ) and it is believed that small binaries could represent a fraction of 15% of the nea population ( @xcite ;",
    "triple systems are rare and only nine known systems have been reported up to now in the entire solar system",
    ".    the dynamical evolution and formation mechanisms of these systems are highly dependent on the size ratio between the secondaries and the primary .",
    "if this ratio is very small , as in the case of the main - belt asteroid ( 243 ) ida , the systems are similar to the classical dynamical problem of a massless satellite orbiting a planet ( see for example @xcite ) , this one being replaced by a possibly highly elongated ellipsoid ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , systems with similar size components , as the near - earth asteroid ( 66391 ) 1999 kw4 , have to be described taking into account both their shapes and their rotations . a lot of studies",
    "have been realized on the expression of the full two - body problem and the study of its characteristics ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , emphasis has been given during the past decade on the description of dissipative effects on binary systems , like tidal effects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or byorp ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we studied in this paper the dynamics and stability of the system ( 87 ) sylvia , which was the first triple asteroid system discovered ( @xcite ) .",
    "the specificities of this system place it in the first class described above .",
    "sylvia , discovered in 1866 , is a low - eccentric and midly - inclined asteroid located in the outer main belt .",
    "its long - term evolution has been investigated through the astdys project ( @xcite ; @xcite ) giving its proper orbital elements ( @xmath0 = 3.486 au , @xmath1 = 0.0537 , @xmath2 = @xmath3 ) and its secular fondamental frequencies ( @xmath4/yr , @xmath5``/yr , @xmath6''/yr ) .",
    "its orbit has been found to be slightly chaotic , exhibiting a lyapunov time of @xmath7 1.4 myr .",
    "the two satellites of sylvia present near - circular and near - equatorial orbits , and have a mass ratio of about @xmath8 and @xmath9 with sylvia .",
    "the outermost satellite , romulus , is approximately ten times more massive than the innermost one , remus , for a semi - major axis twice as important .",
    "@xcite studied the system and found that the satellites could be highly unstable when the oblateness of sylvia ( even a small fraction ) is not taken into account .",
    "indeed , the oblateness of the asteroid , as well as the short distance of the satellites from its surface ( @xmath7 5 and 10 radius of sylvia ) , critically increase the precession frequencies and prevent them from commensurabilities with frequencies arising from other gravitational perturbations .",
    "our aim is the understanding of the dynamical mechanisms present in the system and in its neighborhood .",
    "we then generalize some of the results to the other triple systems , and , in a general way , to the systems similar to ( 87 ) sylvia , e.g. with a small size ratio and a primary diameter of the order of @xmath7 100 km .",
    "the gravitational potential of sylvia is modeled by a spherical harmonics expansion ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant of the central body , @xmath12 is its radius , ( @xmath13 ) are the spherical coordinates of the satellite , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are physical constants depending on the shape of the main body and named coefficients of the expansion ( @xmath16 is the degree and @xmath17 is the order of the coefficients ) , and @xmath18 are the associated legendre polynomials .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion are computed using the freely available software archive shtools developed by mark wieczorek and using the convex shape model of sylvia ( @xcite ; @xcite ) available on damit ( database of asteroid models from inversion techniques ) .",
    "the asteroid shape models are represented by polyhedrons with triangular surface facets .",
    "using this shape model as an input of a home - made code ( which call the functions shexpandlsq , makegriddh and cilmplus of shtools ) , we computed the spherical harmonics coefficients of sylvia up to the tenth degree and order . after having run test integrations",
    ", we conclude that a @xmath19 order and degree harmonics development is sufficient to precisely approximate the perturbation due to the shape of sylvia .",
    "the coefficients up to that degree and order are presented in table [ coefharmo ] .",
    "more details on how they have been computed can be found in @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tabelem ] , the orbital elements and some parameters used for the integrations are presented .",
    "the incertitudes ( when known ) are also given .",
    "the orbital elements and diameters of the satellites have been taken from @xcite and their masses from @xcite .",
    "the orbital elements of the two satellites from @xcite correspond to different epochs of reference , so we took as a reference epoch the mid - time between these epochs ( jd 2453248 ) and move the mean anomalies of the satellites to this date , by considering fixed mean motions .",
    "the heliocentric orbital elements of sylvia at this epoch , as well as its radius and rotation period , have been taken from the jpl service .",
    "the mass of sylvia was obtained from @xcite and the ecliptic coordinates of its pole from @xcite .",
    ".main spherical harmonics coefficients of sylvia . [ cols=\"^,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the tidal age of romulus is of the same order as the one obtained by taylor & margot ( 2011 ) if we consider @xmath20 = @xmath21",
    ". the semi - major axis of romulus at the time when remus attains the stability limit is also indicated , which reflects the tidal age of the actual system .",
    "the byorp parameter @xmath22 determines the amplitude of the byorp effect , but has a reduced effect for the orbits considered here .",
    "we show in fig.[fig5 ] the tidal evolution of the system with the three set of parameters .",
    "the evolution starts with the semi - major axis of remus at 400 km up to the actual configuration , and is subsequently followed during 1 gyr .",
    "the major resonances are shown in the figure .",
    "the evolution for the parameters @xmath20=@xmath21 , @xmath22=@xmath23 is merged with the one corresponding with @xmath20=@xmath24 , @xmath22=@xmath25 , and ends shortly after the evection line .",
    "the satellites are on converging orbits ( the orbit of remus is expanding faster than the one of romulus ) for the three sets of parameters , and the system crosses the evection resonance before the mean - motion resonance 2:1 in each case .    as observed above , the byorp effect is stronger for distant orbits .",
    "we can see in fig.[fig5 ] that a larger value of @xmath22 allows a faster evolution .",
    "it is interesting to note that it also reduces the distance between the two satellites , and thus drives the system towards the mean - motion resonances seen in fig.[fig1 ] , and eventually towards highly chaotic zones",
    ". a smaller value of @xmath22 keeps away the system from these zones as the integration time increases .",
    "a choice of @xmath22 = @xmath25 also has the effect of decreasing the eccentricity of remus after @xmath7 750 myr .",
    "its value monotically increases with the two other sets of parameters .",
    "similarly , using inverse signs for @xmath26 and @xmath27 noticeably changes the evolutions only when @xmath22 = @xmath25 . for this value ,",
    "the orbits become divergent after 450 myr , and the eccentricity of remus can attain 0.08 after 1 gyr , compared to 0.03 with our first choice of sign in the byorp equations .",
    "the inverse signs have a very small effect on the dynamical ages of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "finally , we can observe that the system will also encounter the evection resonance before the mmr 2:1 for the second choice of sign in the byorp equation and the three set of parameters .",
    "we note that with @xmath22 = @xmath25 , the system can even stay between the mmr 2:1 and 3:1 during 5 gyr .",
    "as we know now that the orbits of remus and romulus are located in a stable dynamical zone , it is interesting to know if it is also the case for the other known triple systems .",
    "we also extend this study to satellites of main - belt asteroids , in the case where the masses of the satellites are significantly smaller than the mass of the asteroid . for greater relative masses of the satellites ,",
    "one can no longer neglect the influence of their rotation and shape on their orbital evolution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital elements of the asteroids have been taken from the astdys database .",
    "data concerning the physical parameters of the asteroids and associated satellites , as well as the orbital elements of the satellites , have been taken from various sources ; ( 22 ) kalliope ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 45 ) eugenia ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 87 ) sylvia ( @xcite ) , ( 93 ) minerva ( @xcite ) , ( 107 ) camilla ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 121 ) hermione ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 130 ) elektra ( @xcite ; damit ) , ( 216 ) kleopatra ( @xcite ) , ( 243 ) ida ( @xcite ) , ( 283 ) emma ( @xcite ; damit ) , ( 136108 ) haumea ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the determination of the location of the triple systems relatively to their mean motion resonances just requires the knowledge of the periods of the satellites .",
    "we show in fig.[fig6 ] the positions in semi - major axis of the five multiple systems considered here : ( 45 ) eugenia , ( 87 ) sylvia , ( 93 ) minerva , ( 216 ) kleopatra , and ( 136108 ) haumea .",
    "the semi - major axes are normalized by the hill radius of the asteroid , computed with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the semi - major axis and mass of the asteroid , and @xmath31 is the solar mass .",
    "the figure shows that all the multiple systems , except ( 216 ) kleopatra , are between the mean motion resonances 2:1 and 3:1 . noting that the tidal and byorp evolutions move the systems outwards",
    ", it could be tempting to postulate that the mmr 2:1 prevents the evolution of the satellites from going beyond its location . in fig.[fig8 ]",
    ", we show the evolution of the eccentricity of remus inside the mmr 2:1 .",
    "the semi - major axes of the satellites are chosen in order to place their orbit inside the resonance according to the tidal evolution shown in fig.[fig6 ] ( @xmath32=1067 km , @xmath33=1694 km ) .",
    "the other initial elements are chosen equal to their actual values .",
    "the eccentricity of romulus is much less perturbed and attains only 0.01 for the same timespan , and the inclinations of both satellites remain close to their initial values . using the capture probability estimates of @xcite ,",
    "the satellites are assured to be captured in the resonance if their initial eccentricities are less than the critical values @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the actual eccentricities of the satellites could thus indicate whether they suffered a chaotic evolution in the past .",
    "( 216 ) kleopatra is the only system that seems to have crossed the resonance but , unfortunately , we still have no informations about the actual eccentricities of its satellites .",
    "@xcite studied the orbital and tidal evolution of ( 136108 ) haumea , and argued that the passage of the system through the mmr 3:1 could explain the high value of eccentricity of its inner satellite namaka ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , it can be noted that the known eccentricites of the satellites in the three systems ( 45 ) eugenia , ( 87 ) sylvia and ( 93 ) minerva are quite low ; the maximum value is attained by princess ( the innermost satellite of eugenia ) with @xmath37 .",
    "this could indicate than the passage through the mmr 3:1 is quite safe for the satellites .",
    "although the location , dimensions and mass of haumea make it a completely different object than the main - belt asteroids studied here , with possibly different dynamical mecanisms , we can try to find another explanation for these differences in eccentricity .",
    "we show in the following the location of the satellites with respect to the evection resonance . in order to compute the semi - major axis corresponding to the evection @xmath38 for each satellite",
    ", we solve @xmath39 for @xmath38 .",
    "the frequency of the pericenter @xmath40 is obtained with the corresponding lagrange equation : @xmath41 where the averaged disturbing function @xmath42 contains the solar influence and the oblateness of the asteroid .",
    "@xmath43 is taken from the expansion of @xcite which keeps terms up to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the classical koza approximation .",
    "the eccentricity and inclination of the satellite are fixed values , but the solution @xmath38 still depends on the argument of the pericenter @xmath47 of the satellite , although we checked that this dependence is highly negligible .",
    "the oblateness coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 are determined from the shape of the ellipsoid approximation for each asteroid , using the formulation of @xcite .",
    "an averaged disturbing function describing the perturbation of an additional satellite was used in the case of triple systems .",
    "the resulting disturbing function @xmath50 was taken from the analytical expansion of @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the value of @xmath40 of each of the satellite was found while keeping fixed the semi - major of the other satellite . in the case of ( 87 ) sylvia and ( 136108 ) haumea , it was found that the frequency of pericenter of the innermost satellite could not be low enough to be commensurable with the mean motion of the sun .",
    "in addition , the resonance can be found for the innermost satellite of ( 216 ) kleopatra only when considering the first shape model , giving two values of @xmath38 : 915 km and 1456 km .",
    "however , we did not retain this system in the study , since the lack of information about the eccentricities of its satellites .",
    "similarly , some binary systems have not been retained in this study due to the lack of information about the shape of their asteroid to this date .",
    "this is the case of ( 379 ) huenna , ( 702 ) alauda and ( 762 ) pulkova .    for some systems ,",
    "both the shape of the asteroid from the ellipsoid approximation , and a theorical value of @xmath48 determined from the knowledge of the satellite orbit are known .",
    "the computation of @xmath38 gives approximately similar results .",
    "the distance of the satellites from the evection resonance is shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the uncertainties in semi - major axis and eccentricity correspond to the uncertainties on the knowledge of the orbits .",
    "the small number of systems available make statistical considerations rather ambiguous but we can try to make a few considerations , based on the assumption that the tidal and byorp effects make the satellites evolve outwards .",
    "first we can consider the fact that satellites beyond the evection resonance are rather close to it .",
    "for a comparison , the moon would be located at @xmath51 @xmath38 in the figure ( using for the earth @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "apart from observational biases , this could maybe point out the evection resonance as a powerful way to eject satellites of asteroids .",
    "the effect of the evection resonance is already well - known for dramatically increasing the eccentricity of a satellite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as an example , we show in fig.[fig12 ] the highly chaotic evolution of romulus inside the resonance .",
    "its initial eccentricity , as well as the initial semi - major axis and eccentricity of remus , have been given accordingly to the tidal and byorp evolution of the system , with the parameters @xmath20 = @xmath24 , @xmath22=@xmath23 .",
    "the larger number of satellites with very - low eccentricity located before the resonance could infer that hypothesis , which will be investigated in a following paper .",
    "we studied the dynamics and stability of the ( 87 ) sylvia triple system by using numerical integrations of the complete and averaged equations of motion .",
    "we used a shape of sylvia derived from light - curves observations and up to @xmath54 for the complete integrations .",
    "the position of the actual system lies in a very stable zone .",
    "we showed the possible evolutions of the system trough tidal and byorp effects , and showed that the system , currently lying between the mean - motion resonances 2:1 and 3:1 , will likely evolve through the evection resonance before the mmr 2:1 in the future .",
    "the other known triple system considered here , except ( 216 ) kleopatra , also lie between the mmr 2:1 and 3:1 .",
    "finally , we show that the evection resonance could limit the outward evolution of the satellites .",
    "the authors warmly thank a. lemaitre for her constructive comments and her careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "numerical simulations were made thanks to the local computing resources ( clusters iscf and urbm - sysdyn ) at the university of namur ( fundp , belgium ) .",
