    "the geometric idea leading to ( [ eq : colored - laman - sparse ] ) is that a sub - framework that `` sees '' @xmath19 flexible periods has @xmath36 non - trivial degrees of freedom from the lattice representation , @xmath37 from the coordinates of the vertices , and each connected component has either two or three `` trivial '' motions commuting with any fixed lattice representation .",

    "the combinatorial steps in @xcite rely on the `` edge - doubling trick '' of lovsz @xcite and recski @xcite and then decompositions obtained by submodular function theory @xcite .",
    "seeing as the colored graph families under consideration arise in a planar rigidity setting , it is natural to ask what the connection they have to the well - studied @xmath38-sparse graphs ( shortly _ laman graphs _ ) characterizing the minimally rigid planar frameworks @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to see that the @xmath10-rank zero subgraphs must be @xmath38-sparse . on the other hand ,",
    "the proof method employed here is based around the following proposition that characterizes a cone - laman graph in terms of its symmetric cover :    [ prop : cone - laman - lift ] let @xmath26 be an odd prime , and let @xmath5 be a @xmath6-colored graph with @xmath15 vertices and @xmath39 edges .",

    "thus , we also obtain a distinction between the cone - laman - sparse colored graph families and the more general ones introduced to understand periodic and crystallographic frameworks .",
    "finding the `` right '' generalization of proposition [ prop : cone - laman - lift ] would be very interesting .",
    "proposition [ prop : cone - laman - lift ] allows us to study the combinatorial structure of cone - laman graphs via the symmetric lift @xmath32 .",
    "this allows us to apply the entire theory of laman - sparse graphs apply .",
    "colored henneberg moves on a cone - laman graph @xmath13 correspond to `` symmetrized groups '' of uncolored henneberg moves on @xmath32 .",
    "the idea of symmetrizing henneberg moves is not new @xcite , but the approach taken here is .",
    "the difficult step ( lemma [ lemma : cone - h2-reverse ] ) is to show that , after removing an entire vertex _ orbit _ in @xmath32 , an entire edge _ orbit _ may be added to the remaining graph while maintaining laman - sparsity .",
    "the proof makes use of a new circuit - elimination argument ( proposition [ prop : cyclic - eliminate ] ) that avoids a complicated cases analysis .",
    "when dealing with the families of ( uncolored , finite ) @xmath0-sparse graphs @xcite , we adopt the following conventions : _ @xmath0-circuits _ are minimal violations of sparsity ; a graph is _ @xmath0-spanning _ if it contains a spanning @xmath0-graph ; a _",

    "while the choice of colored quotient is not canonical , the rank of the image of the induced homomorphism @xmath47 is , which justifies the use of colored graphs in situations where the natural definition is in terms of symmetric graphs . to compute @xmath10 on a cycle @xmath48",
