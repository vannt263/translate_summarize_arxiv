    "we have found over the years that several nonlinear , partial differential equations of physics , not integrable by standard methods , such as inverse scattering or else an inversion of variables , yield their secrets to lagrangian coordinate methods @xcite@xcite . here",
    "we will treat one such equation pair and see a combination of two ` lagrangian ' transformations ( the second one will be called quasi - lagrangian for reasons to be explained ) and a twofold introduction of the lambert function enable us to solve the one lane traffic flow problem explicitely . a further class of solutions is found in parametric form .",
    "although we find a class of solutions that falls short of being general , common sense situations are well described , as well as some unexpected ones .",
    "the interesting thing , however , is that the much researched nonlinear equations involved , known for a long time now , can in some instances be solved exactly , without recourse to approximations and with little or no numerics .    in 1955 ,",
    "james lighthill and his former research student , whitham , formulated an equation describing single lane traffic flow , assumed congested enough to justify a fluid model .",
    "the theory was formulated in the second part of their classic paper on kinematic waves @xcite .",
    "richards independently came to the same conclusion and published in the following year @xcite .",
    "next payne @xcite and whitham @xcite added a second equation and replaced the lwr equation with standard continuity . we will call this pair lwrp .",
    "recently the literature on both models has grown considerably , see for example the books by kern @xcite and further references @xcite@xcite .",
    "extensions to more than one lane , lane changing , discrete models , higher order effects , as well as numerical work , prevail .",
    "one of the original authors has found a toda lattice like solution to the discrete version of newell @xcite , see @xcite . in a future paper",
    ", we will see if the methods introduced here can be applied to some of these recent extensions of lwrp and lwr .",
    "assume a long segment of a one lane road , deprived of entries and exits , sufficiently congested by traffic and free of breakdowns to admit a continuous treatment , so as to permit us to postulate the usual equation of continuity : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the density of cars , the maximum of which corresponds to a rather deplorable , but all too familiar almost bumper to bumper situation , and @xmath3 is the local velocity .",
    "the right hand side of the second , newtonian equation , formulated by payne @xcite and whitham @xcite , is less obvious : @xmath4 the first term on the right involves the mean drivers reaction time @xmath5 , and the next term models a diffusion effect depending on the drivers awareness of conditions beyond the preceding car .",
    "the constant @xmath6 is a sort of diffusion coefficient , measuring the effect of the density gradient .",
    "some recent improved models also bring in the second derivative , but we will not at this stage .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 and @xmath2 both constant give a possible solution to the lwrp equations .",
    "indeed , in his book whitham expands around this equilibrium and treats the linear waves and possible instability so obtained @xcite .",
    "however , exact nonlinear solutions are what we are interested in at the present .",
    "we specify @xmath8 this often postulated form of @xmath9 is the only one that leads to an integrable equation , as far as we can see .",
    "fortunately , the plot of @xmath10 , which people measure , is always convex and parabola - like , see whitham s figure 3.1 .",
    "thus , so far luck is with us .",
    "we introduce dimensionless variables by replacing @xmath11 this leaves the continuity equation unchanged , and the newtonian equation takes the form : @xmath12",
    "the non - linearity on the left hand side of equations ( [ cont ] ) and ( [ momds ] ) can be eliminated by introducing lagrangian coordinates : @xmath13 , the initial position ( at @xmath14 ) of a fluid element which at time @xmath15 was at @xmath16 , and time @xmath15 . in this description ,",
    "the independent variable @xmath16 becomes a function of @xmath17 and @xmath15 , as are the fluid parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "here and in what follows we adopt the convention that a superposition of two functions which introduces a new variable is denoted by the same symbol as the original function , but of the new variable .",
    "denoting by @xmath20 either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , the basic transformation between eulerian coordinates @xmath0 and lagrangian ones @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 we denote by @xmath23 the number of cars between the last one at @xmath24 and that at @xmath17 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the initial mass density distribution .    here and",

    "the results , depending on two parameters @xmath212 and @xmath213 , are shown in figure 8 .     as functions of @xmath15 for @xmath214 and @xmath215 , @xmath170 , @xmath143 , @xmath216 , and @xmath172 . ]",
    "a characteristic feature of the plots representing the density given in parametric form , @xmath203 and @xmath204 , is that the mesh lines correspond to @xmath217 , and @xmath218 , see figures 6 and 7 . for the density",
    "given explicitly , @xmath142 , they correspond to @xmath219 , and @xmath218 , see figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the mesh lines @xmath217 are particularly useful . each point on a @xmath217 mesh line",
    "gives us the information of both the actual position @xmath41 and the associated density at time @xmath15 , for the car that started from @xmath220 at @xmath14 .",
    "this information is given in the frame moving along with the discontinuity at @xmath28 .",
    "the motion of these frames in turn is described by the characteristics labelled with @xmath28 in figure 8 .",
    "adding cases i and ii , we have a solution such that the initial congestion splits in the middle , resulting once again in a slower cavalcade following a faster one , see figure 8 .",
    "this is rather like a two soliton solution of the korteweg  de vries equation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "our solutions augment those found for simpler , single equation nonlinear models , e.g. burgers , see @xcite .",
    "our exact solutions converge to single or double stationary travelling wave structures after a few @xmath5 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this steady state convergence is more or less what one would expect , at least in the single case .",
    "the lwrp equations have several families of solutions , to which we hereby add .",
    "generally we must use common sense to home in on the relevant ones . however , exact solutions help and absolve us from the need to guess . as in police work , connecting initial conditions with a present situation requires painstakingly following through the history .",
    "exact solutions exempt us of this task .    we introduce a lagrangian transformation in @xmath0 .",
    "the variables are now @xmath21 , @xmath17 being the position at @xmath14 .",
    "it labels the car rather than its actual position .",
    "the continuity equation is now linear , simplifying further calculations .",
    "it may so happen that the newtonian equation can yield a condition in just one dependent variable .",
    "if this condition can be factorized , there is a possibility of finding exact solutions by finding solutions to this factorized equation , being of lower order . in our case ,",
    "two distinct factorizations were possible , both were solved , and both solutions were needed to cover all @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , each factorization was assigned to a specific half axis , the same for all cases considered .",
    "this situation , demanding merging two solutions to cover the whole domain , is unusual in a nonlinear problem .",
    "another requirement was that the original profile have only one maximum at @xmath54 .",
    "we had to introduce a second , quasi lagrangian transformation to linearise .",
    "in general , we obtain the solution in parametric form . however , if we are lucky , we can solve completely , that is get rid of the parameter , by using lambert functions .",
    "we give an example of this .",
    "it should be stressed that a complete solution is only possible if we combine our two factorized equations , i and ii . this is similar to the situation for solutions to the wave equation @xmath221 such that solutions of @xmath174 and @xmath175 coexist .",
    "however , this coexistence is somewhat surprising for a nonlinear system .",
    "an interesting question is : how wide a class of non - linear problems can be so solved ?",
    "perhaps one possibility is furnished by the somewhat similar gas dynamics and shallow water equations",
    "? in our case , exponential initial conditions alone seem to promise that the lambert function will make an appearance .",
    "perhaps they should be used for similar problems .",
    "another interesting question is how general is the requirement of merging solutions i and ii when two factorizations of the consistency condition exist ."
