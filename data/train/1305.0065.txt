    "fundamental models of many - body physics , originally developed as approximate theoretical descriptions of highly complex underlying systems , have in recent years been realized experimentally with an unprecedented degree of control thanks to advances in atomic physics and quantum optics . in particular , systems using ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices @xcite and systems based on cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed )",
    "@xcite have provided effective realizations ( or `` quantum simulations '' @xcite ) of many - body models with a high degree of accuracy via exquisite experimental control and manipulation of atoms and electromagnetic fields .",
    "such approaches also offer a flexible means of varying the effective model parameters , opening up exciting possibilities for exploring several frontiers of many - body physics and of strongly interacting quantum systems in general .",
    "such realizations are particularly interesting in light of quantum phase transitions in many - body systems @xcite , as the flexibility of the schemes allows ready access to different phases and to the boundary ( critical ) regions between them . in particular , transitions between different phases can , for example , be observed in real time by the slow variation of one or more controllable system parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one can also consider more rapid `` quench '' dynamics by a sudden change of parameters , taking the system from one region of phase space to a distinctly different region over a short period of time ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and thereby inducing complicated , non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "in addition , signatures of the critical behaviour are observable in the output channels from the systems ; for example , in cavity qed systems , one typically finds dramatic changes in the properties of the output field of the cavity , such as the intensity and the photon counting statistics , and , for example , spontaneous symmetry breaking at a critical point may in fact be directly observable through homodyne detection of the field @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of such effective realizations is that they often offer generalizations of the original model , sometimes in terms of non - trivial extensions of the hamiltonian of the system , and also due to the intrinsically open ( dissipative ) nature of atomic and cavity qed systems , which in itself can lead to new phenomena .",
    "one particular example of this , which will be our focus in this work , is the effective realization of the dicke model quantum phase transition using a superfluid gas in an optical cavity , recently demonstrated in @xcite . here , the two - level atoms of the original dicke model are realized using resonant raman transitions between a pair of discrete momentum states of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "when comparing with the original dicke model @xcite , this realization offers a number of generalizations , such as the non - negligible decay of the optical cavity field , independently tunable interaction strengths for rotating and counter - rotating terms in the atom - field interaction hamiltonian , and a new non - linear coupling term between the cavity photon number and the collective atomic inversion .",
    "the implications of these generalizations have been studied theoretically in great detail in @xcite in the `` thermodynamic limit '' of a large number of atoms , where a semiclassical model can be employed .",
    "this analysis predicts an exceedingly rich dynamical phase diagram for the steady state of the system with fundamentally new behaviour and phases , such as a new superradiant phase , co - existence regions , and regimes with oscillatory long - time attractors .",
    "the theoretical results of @xcite focus on parameters appropriate to the experiment in @xcite . an analogous realization of the same model could also be based upon raman transitions between a pair of electronic hyperfine ground states in alkali atoms , as first proposed and investigated theoretically in @xcite .",
    "this leads to an identical effective dicke model , but the scheme potentially offers access to a broader range of the effective parameters , and alternative ways of tuning them in order to access different regions of phase space . further investigation of this scheme in @xcite , albeit focussing on the single - atom case , suggests that rubidium atoms coupled to a high finesse optical cavity should enable a good realization of the model .",
    "a many - atom cavity qed setup as realized recently in @xcite is potentially of most immediate relevance to the current work .    in particular ,",
    "in this work we study this effective dicke model including all quantum effects , and considering finite numbers of atoms .",
    "how this quantum model connects with the results for the thermodynamic limit considered previously is one aspect of our analysis , but , to further complement the work in @xcite , we also consider somewhat different parameter regimes , motivated by the possibility of realizing the model using the scheme discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "we will see that one can achieve good acccess to the distinct regions of parameter space , with parameter ranges believed feasible based on the results from @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our findings indicate that one can observe phase transitions between a range of distinctly different phases through the variation of a single model parameter .",
    "the generalized dicke model that we consider describes the interaction of @xmath0 two - level atoms with a single mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the dynamics can be given in terms of a master equation for the density operator , @xmath1 , of the atoms and cavity mode , as @xcite : @xmath2 + 2\\kappa \\mathcal{d}[a]\\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a super - operator defined through @xmath5\\rho = o\\rho o\\dagg - 1/2 o\\dagg o \\rho - 1/2 \\rho o\\dagg o$ ] , for any operator @xmath6 .",
    "parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the atomic and cavity frequencies , respectively , @xmath9 is the linear interaction strength , and @xmath10 is a non - linear coupling constant .",
    "operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the annihilation and creation operators for the cavity field , and @xmath13 are collective atomic operators satisfying angular momentum commutation relations : @xmath14 = 2j_z$ ] , @xmath15 = \\mp j_\\pm$ ] .",
    "reproduces the conventional equilibrium dicke model if @xmath16 .",
    "this generalized dicke model has been studied theoretically in @xcite in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath17 . in this limit",
    "one can derive a closed set of equations for the expectation values @xmath18 using and assuming factorization of operator products , i.e. , @xmath19 , one can arrive at the following semiclassical equations of motion : @xmath20 we note that both the quantum and semiclassical models conserve the total length of the spin .",
    "physical initial conditions of course require that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . in @xcite dynamical phase diagrams",
    "were mapped out by considering the long time attractors of .",
    "the semiclassical analysis predicts an exceedingly rich phase diagram , where the generalizations due to cavity decay and the non - linear coupling ( @xmath10 ) leads to fundamentally new behaviour and phases , including a new superradiant phase , coexistence regions , and regimes of persistent oscillations for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "since one of our goals is to compare the semiclassical predictions with fully quantum results for finite @xmath0 , we first summarize briefly some of the main results from @xcite .",
    "the steady states of can be found analytically by requiring @xmath25 .",
    "one finds that the semiclassical normal phase , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and inverted phase @xmath26 , @xmath28 are always valid fixed points .",
    "in addition , two superradiant phases , referred to as superradiant a ( sra ) and superradiant b ( srb ) , are possible .",
    "the sra phase refers to solutions where @xmath29 and the srb phase to solutions where @xmath30 .",
    "we will assume @xmath31 throughout this paper , so that the latter condition is only possible for @xmath32 .",
    "the onset of superradiance from the normal / inverted phase was identified at critical values of the coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "the sra phase comes into existence for @xmath33 where @xmath34 refers to the onset from the normal phase , @xmath35 from the inverted phase , and @xmath36 the steady state values in this phase are @xmath37 similarly , the srb phase comes into existence if @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the steady state values are @xmath40 since these results imply that multiple fixed points exists at any given point in parameter space , a further stability analysis of the different steady states is necessary to determine the phase diagram .",
    "however , one can immediately draw a few conclusions based on the above results .",
    "physical solutions require @xmath41 , and of course @xmath42 must be real .",
    "this means that for the two roots of the sra solution @xmath43 , the @xmath35 solution can only exist for @xmath44 , and the @xmath34 solution only for @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , the srb solution can only be valid if @xmath44 ( recall that we assume @xmath31 ) .",
    "the two critical points for @xmath10 at @xmath46 are found to mark the change in stability for the normal and inverted phases , the inverted phase being stable only if @xmath44 and the normal phase only if @xmath45 .",
    "we do not reproduce the semiclassical stability analysis here , but refer to @xcite for details .",
    "we note in particular that the region @xmath47 has no stable semiclassical fixed points .",
    "it does yield a steady state solution for @xmath42 given by @xcite @xmath48 as in the srb phase , but the region has periodic orbits as long time attractors for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the results of the semiclassical steady state analysis can be summarized in a phase diagram for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is shown in for parameters @xmath49 mhz , @xmath50 mhz and @xmath51 mhz ( the specific values of which are motivated by @xcite ) .",
    "these results are analogous to the phase diagram in figure 4 of ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular , this diagram suggests that there is a possibility of taking the system through a whole range of different phases upon the variation of a single parameter , @xmath10 .",
    "schematic phase diagram based on the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the two superradiant phases are denoted sra and srb .",
    "@xmath52 refers to the normal phase @xmath53 , @xmath54 to the inverted phase @xmath55 , and `` limit cycle '' to the region @xmath56 , with periodic orbits as the semiclassical long time attractors for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath34 sign indicates co - existence phases .",
    "the dashed lines show three horizontal cuts , at @xmath57 mhz , of the phase diagram that we will consider in the following sections . ]",
    "in this section , we present numerical solutions of as the parameter @xmath10 is varied , and connect this to the semiclassical predictions discussed above .",
    "we focus our interest primarily on the steady state of , numerically approximated by an inverse power method iterated until an absolute tolerance of @xmath58 is achieved @xcite . alternatively",
    ", steady states could be approximated by integrating for long times , but this approach is problematic due to the exceedingly long time - scales involved in certain regions of parameter space , as pointed out in @xcite ( see also below ) . the cavity mode hilbert space was approximated with a truncated fock space , with up to nine states for the largest value of @xmath9 considered .",
    "we focus here on the parameters used in , i.e. , @xmath49 mhz , @xmath50 mhz , @xmath51 mhz , @xmath10 in the range @xmath59 mhz @xmath60 mhz , and @xmath61 up to 0.17 mhz . as for the number of atoms , we vary @xmath0 up to a maximum value of @xmath62 .",
    "a first observation that we would like to draw attention to , however , is that in regions of parameter space where the semiclassical analysis predicts co - existence phases , the size of the basin of attraction typically varies greatly for the individual fixed points .",
    "if there are two , or more , fixed points with appreciably large basins of attraction compared to the characteristic size of quantum fluctuations , one would expect the steady state of the ensemble average dynamics given by to consist of a mixture of the solutions centered around the semiclassical fixed points .",
    "but , the semiclassical analysis does not predict the weighting of different fixed points , and we find this to in general depend on @xmath0 and the other parameters .",
    "if a fixed point which is stable in the asymptotic limit , @xmath63 , has a basin of attraction that is too small compared to quantum fluctuations for finite @xmath0 , this fixed point will not contribute to the steady state of the quantum dynamics .",
    "we will often see this in our numerical results to follow .",
    "another observation is that , for finite @xmath0 , the normal ( @xmath52 ) and inverted ( @xmath54 ) phases , @xmath64 , are in fact never the exact steady states of the quantum dynamics , as long as @xmath65 . indeed , even in regions of parameter space where the semiclassical analysis predicts one of these phases as the unique stable fixed point , one finds a small , but non - zero , photon number in the cavity for finite @xmath0 .",
    "this photon - production comes from the counter - rotating terms in , and might at first glance seem unphysical .",
    "we must here remember though , that is an effective model that comes about via laser - pumped raman transitions between distinct states of a multilevel system ( such as an alkali atom or bec ) , and the photon flux from the cavity can thus be explained by the energy input of the lasers involved in the effective realization .",
    "the normal and inverted phases are only approached in the limit @xmath63 .    with this in mind , we vary the parameter @xmath10 along the horizontal cuts , shown as dashed lines in , and compare the semiclassical predictions to steady state expectation values given by .",
    "we also find it useful , as a means of shedding further light on the various phases and phase transitions , to look at how the reduced density operator for the cavity field , @xmath66 , and the collective spin , @xmath67 , change .",
    "this can be visualized with , for example , the wigner function and the atomic @xmath68-function , respectively . here",

    "we start our discussion on the finite @xmath0 results by considering the behaviour as @xmath10 is varied at low @xmath9 ; in particular , for @xmath78 mhz .",
    "this corresponds to the lowest dashed line in .",
    "there are no superradiant phases in this region of parameter space , but the semiclassical analysis suggests a transition from a co - existent @xmath88 phase for @xmath44 to a @xmath52 phase for @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore , there is a transition to the `` limit cycle '' region for @xmath90 , where the semiclassical solutions for @xmath91 and @xmath92 oscillate .",
    "it is not obvious from the semiclassical analysis how these transitions might manifest themselves in the quantum state of the system , i.e. , the steady state of the quantum master equation ( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "we first look , in , at the steady state expectation values ( or `` order parameters '' ) @xmath79 and @xmath93 as @xmath10 is varied along the cut @xmath78 mhz .",
    "we also show in the same figure the intensity correlation function of the cavity field , @xmath94 , in the steady state . we compare results for @xmath83 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 atoms . the semiclassical solutions , as given in the previous section , are shown as green dashed lines wherever they apply , for comparison . as expected , the photon number in the cavity is small throughout , but there is a sharp increase at @xmath97 .",
    "a pronounced increase is also seen in the collective atomic inversion , @xmath79 , at this point , with a shape that is characteristic of a second order phase transition .    as for the region @xmath44 , the behaviour of the system",
    "is seen to vary greatly with @xmath0 , and , for small @xmath0 , also with @xmath10 . regarding the dependence on @xmath0",
    ", we point out that the energies of the states @xmath98 and @xmath99 are degenerate at @xmath100 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "degeneracies in the hamiltonian of the ground state and an excited state at a critical point is the trademark of equilibrium quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "we are considering a dynamical steady state of a quantum master equation , but with a degeneracy in the spectrum at a value of @xmath103 , certainly a significant dependence on @xmath0 is not surprising . note that this is not predicted in the thermodynamic limit , as the degeneracy is pushed out to @xmath104 .",
    "one might wonder if there are any sharp changes to the steady state at this point of degeneracy in the spectrum .",
    "the expectation values in do not indicate this .",
    "however , there is , in fact , a sharp transition in the quantum state of the _ spin _ as @xmath10 crosses @xmath105 .",
    "this can be visualized using the atomic @xmath68-function , as defined in the previous section and considered below .",

    "contour plots of the wigner function for a series of values of @xmath10 , with @xmath62 , are shown in .",

    "the atomic @xmath68-function is plotted on the bloch sphere for the same values of @xmath10 , and @xmath62 , in . here ,",
    "significant variation in the atomic state can be seen . starting out as a ring shape for large , negative @xmath10",
    ", there is an increasing concentration around two points , approaching a two - peak structure as @xmath10 is close to @xmath106 .",
    "as @xmath10 crosses this point , the @xmath68-function changes into a new two - peak structure , with a concentration around the north and south pole ",
    "this is what we would expect for a @xmath88 co - existent phase .",

    "the results indicate a low degree of distillable entanglement for large @xmath0 , except close to the superradiant phase transition around @xmath151 ( assuming @xmath9 is large enough ) , in the sra phase close to @xmath152 , and , interestingly , in the semiclassical limit cycle region , where @xmath153 .",
    "for low @xmath9 , the results add to what was observed in the expectation values considered earlier , namely a second order phase transition at @xmath152 , whereas the change in stability of the inverted phase at @xmath123 , that was predicted by the semiclassical analysis , is not related to a phase transition for the quantum system .",
    "for higher @xmath9 , however , the results point towards a first order phase transition at this value of @xmath10 .",
    "the results so far point towards some similarities between large negative and positive @xmath10 , especially for low @xmath9 .",
    "the cavity photon number tends towards zero as @xmath154 grows , as does @xmath79 .",
    "further investigation shows that for large @xmath154 , and finite @xmath0 , the atomic @xmath68-function develops a distinctly ring - type structure , which moves towards the equator of the bloch sphere with growing @xmath154 , pointing towards a well - defined value for @xmath155 .",
    "calculation of the purity of the steady state , @xmath156 $ ] , further reveals the approach towards a pure state with growing @xmath154 and in turn towards a simplified dynamic for large @xmath154 .",
    "in fact , investigation shows that the steady state approaches the state @xmath157 in this limit , where @xmath158 is a @xmath155 eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath159 . in",
    "we show the fidelity of the steady state with the state @xmath160 for @xmath161 mhz @xmath162 @xmath163 mhz , where the fidelity of two quantum states @xmath1 and @xmath164 is defined as @xmath165.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     fidelity with the state @xmath166 , for the three different cuts of the phase diagram : @xmath82 , @xmath62 ( squares ) , @xmath135 , @xmath84 ( crosses ) and @xmath128 , @xmath114 ( diamonds ) . ]",
    "we have studied , by numerical means , a generalized dicke model , where the long time attractor for the model is a dynamical quantum steady state , resulting from a balance between photon production , due to the counter - rotating terms of the dicke model hamiltonian , and decay of the cavity field .",
    "this generalized model has recently received attention due to its realization in a quantum gas experiment using an optical cavity .",
    "other recent experimental demonstrations of self - organization for a large number of rubidium atoms coupled to a high - finesse cavity also point towards a promising potential realization of the model .",
    "we have in particular focused on the consequences of a non - linear coupling between the cavity photon number and the collective atomic inversion , written as @xmath167 , that is not present in the conventional dicke model .",
    "if the non - linear coupling constant , @xmath10 , becomes comparable to the cavity frequency , @xmath8 , it can qualitatively change the steady state of the system .",
    "we have investigated this in detail , including quantum fluctuations and for a finite number of atoms , and seen how the steady state can be taken through a number of distinct phase transitions , which are observable , for example , as sharp changes in the cavity output field , as @xmath10 is varied .",
    "the predictions of an approximate , semiclassical model are seen to be approached as the number of atoms is increased .    for large values of the non - linear coupling , the atomic steady state approaches a state with a well - defined value for the inversion , @xmath155 , whereas @xmath168 become delocalized  the latter corresponding to periodic orbits for the expectation values in the semiclassical approximation . in particular , as @xmath10 tends to infinity , the steady state approaches the pure state @xmath169 , i.e. , the vacuum state for the cavity , while the atoms are in the maximally entangled @xmath170 eigenstate . for a finite number of atoms , @xmath0 ,",
    "this is also the case for @xmath171 , whereas in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath63 , a mixture of @xmath172 , eigenstates is predicted for large negative @xmath10 . for finite @xmath0 , this co - existence phase is observed for negative @xmath44 , but a sharp change in the atomic state appears at @xmath173 , corresponding to the development of a ring - type structure in the atomic @xmath68-function , which eventually approaches the @xmath170 eigenstate , as in the @xmath174 case .",
    "the rich behaviour of the system , due to the presence of cavity decay and the non - linear atom - photon coupling , together with the readily observable cavity output field , suggests that various experimental implementations might offer observations of not only the conventional superradiant dicke quantum phase transition , but also other novel quantum phases and phase - boundaries as well .",
    "we hope that this work might further stimulate experimental , as well as theoretical , investigations of the model .",
