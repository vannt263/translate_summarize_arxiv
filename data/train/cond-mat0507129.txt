    "the realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of a dilute gas of trapped atoms @xcite has opened the way to great improvements in the domain of atom optics and atom interferometry .",
    "the macroscopic population of atoms in a single quantum state is the matter - wave analog to a laser in optics @xcite for which the generalization of its use has revolutionized interferometry technology @xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that the use of bose - einstein condensed atoms will advance the field of atom optics and non linear atom optics @xcite .",
    "in particular , becs will bring about an unprecedented level of accuracy in atom interferometry @xcite .    in the several years since their first observation",
    ", becs have been studied extensively @xcite . in most cases",
    "the condensate properties themselves are the focus of the investigations .",
    "relatively little work has been done so far using a condensate as a tool to explore questions in other fields @xcite .",
    "therefore , developing a system that could be used for these purposes is worthwhile , but needs a special focus in the conception of the key elements .",
    "one of the main challenges when designing such a bec apparatus is to produce in a stable and reproducible way bose - einstein condensates with a large number of atoms .",
    "for that , one needs to optically collect many atoms and have a long lifetime for the atoms in the trap where the atoms will be cooled down to a few hundred nanokelvins . to reach these ultra low temperatures and enter the quantum degeneracy regime , evaporative cooling of trapped atoms @xcite remains at this time the most efficient method .",
    "this technique relies on a sufficiently high binary collision rate in order to allow fast thermalization of the external degrees of freedom of the atoms @xcite .",
    "thus , besides requiring an ultrahigh vacuum and a sophisticated timing system , the major challenge lies in designing an adequate and easy - to - use non - dissipative trap with high confinement , either using magnetic or optical fields , which forms the core element of each bec experiment .",
    "potential applications , such as inertial sensors in space @xcite , mandate the highest gradients for the lowest power .",
    "several groups around the world have unveiled condensate - producing technologies that may in the future prove to fullfill the requirements .",
    "one such system involves ",
    "macroscopic \" magnets , either permanent or electrically controlled @xcite .",
    "a magnetic configuration commonly used is the ioffe - pritchard trap configuration @xcite because it avoids trap losses due to nonadiabatic spin flips : a quadrupolar linear trap providing the radial confinement is combined with a dipolar trap providing the axial confinement . to increase the density of trapped atoms and ensure a high collision rate ,",
    "tight confinement is necessary . to accomplish those requirements ,",
    "ioffe traps typically dissipate kilowatts of power necessitating considerable cooling and stabilization as well as causing electronic switching problems .",
    "different structures of magnetic traps have been widely used and a few , such as the quic traps @xcite , the ferromagnetic traps @xcite , the permament magnets @xcite or a combination @xcite have very low power consumption .",
    "another system called  atom chip \" involves a surface magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and a magnetic trap based on a wafer with lithographically patterned wires @xcite .",
    "this technology is compact , generates condensates with unprecedented rapidity , and holds promise for eventually being simpler and more robust than traditional condensate machines .",
    "nevertheless it requires more expertise to fabricate @xcite and might not allow for high fluxes because of its small size .",
    "the latest approach is the all optical method @xcite . by eliminating the magnetic trap altogether ,",
    "this method indeed may eventually become the simplest route to bec , but the need for high power lasers makes it still difficult with the present technology .    our system is a hybrid magnetic trap that falls in the first category .",
    "it uses strong iron core magnets to produce radial confining fields and low power electromagnetic coils to produce axial confinement and a bias field . the ferromagnets guide and concentrate the magnetic flux where it is needed , i.e. on the atoms , and thus can be used to create a compact and light aparatus that consumes very little power .",
    "they are used above saturation threshold and thus , do not need to be actively temperature controlled like permanent magnets @xcite and only need moderate cooling compared to electromagnetic coils producing the same field .",
    "the tight confinement from the ferromagnets insures that we have the necessary collision rate to evaporatively cool the atoms .",
    "the longitudinal bias field , the only parameter for which stability is critical , is produced by servo - controlled electromagnetic coils , which are water cooled .    in this paper , we report on the development of this new hybrid electromagnet . in the first section",
    "we explain the main advantages of ferromagnetic trapping . in the second and third section",
    "we describe this electromagnet and present the way it is used to cool @xmath0rb atoms . in the last section we present stability measurements made using atom lasers .",
    "ferromagnetic structures @xcite , which have been developed @xcite in our group , make possible high gradient fields with reasonable power consumption and large condensates .",
    "ferromagnetism @xcite consists in exciting a magnetic material with coils .",
    "this excitation orientates the microscopic magnetic moments , so that field in the material is enhanced . due to the high permittivity of ferromagnetic materials ,",
    "the ferromagnetic core guides the magnetic flux . to understand this effect ,",
    "let us consider the magnetic circuit represented in figure [ culasse ] .",
    "the two tips are separated by a gap @xmath2 of a few centimeters .",
    "the ferromagnetic structure has a total length @xmath3 and a section @xmath4 .",
    "the whole structure is excited by a coil of @xmath5 loops driven by a current @xmath6 , leading to an excitation @xmath7 . from ampere s theorem @xcite",
    ", we can introduce the reluctance @xmath8 : @xmath9 inside the iron core and @xmath10 : @xmath11 in the gap between the tips .",
    "a simple relation between the excitation @xmath7 and the magnetic flux @xmath12 can be written : @xmath13 since @xmath14 is very large ( @xmath15 ) for ferromagnetic materials , only the gap contribution is important ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "a more complete calculation @xcite shows that the field created in the gap is similar to that created with two coils of excitation @xmath17 placed close to the tips as represented in figure [ culasse ] .",
    "thus , guiding of the magnetic field created by arbitrary large coils far away from the rather small trapping volume is achieved .",
    "this is only true if a yoke links a north pole to a south pole . if not , no guiding occurs and the field in the gap is significantly reduced .",
    "ferromagnetic materials are also subjected to hysteresis cycles generating remnant fields which must be compensated to offer an appropriate magnetic environment .",
    "this is somewhat difficult to accomplish as long as some coupling exists between the dipole and the quadrupole causing the remnant field to have a complex geometry . in this case , several additional coils are required to provide the right compensating field as previously described in @xcite . to avoid these couplings",
    ", we use a partially - ferromagnetic electromagnet where iron cores are only used where strong fields ( gradients ) are needed ( i.e. the quadrupole part of the ioffe - pritchard configuration ) . with this configuration",
    ", we can independantly act on the bias and the gradients , and the remnant fields retain a simple geometry .",
    "the configuration of the electromagnet is shown in fig .  [ figelectromagnet ] and [ figpolesandfields ] .",
    "the quadrupole field is produced by two ferromagnetic pieces , each one composing two poles in a way very similar to figure [ culasse ] .",
    "each ferromagnetic piece is excited by a coil of 5  cm diameter made with hollow copper wire ( 5  mm diameter ) with 10 windings .",
    "the hollow wire allows the exciting coils to be water cooled .",
    "poles are 2  cm wide and are bevelled mainly in order to better guide the magnetic field but also to leave some space for the vertical magneto - optical trap beams .",
    "the dipolar coils are 100 turn coils of copper wire excited by equal current and separated each other by 3  cm .",
    "they are conical to facilitate the path of the magneto - optical trap beams and positioned on a macor and brass support , which is also water cooled .",
    "another pair of electromagnetic coils called  anti - dipole coils \" is used to make the bias adjustable .",
    "these coils are larger than the dipole coils , separated from each other by 10  cm and placed at the support termination .",
    "the dipole and antidipole coils are mounted in series , but with the currents flowing in opposite directions , so as to cancel out noise in the magnetic field due to current fluctuations .",
    "we can set the value for the bias field by controling the number of windings of the anti - dipole coils @xcite .",
    "_ static performances of the ferromagnetic structure _",
    "the maximum achievable quadrupole gradient @xmath18 is 830  g / cm , obtained for a saturating current of 60  a ( see fig .",
    "[ figquadgrad ] ) .",
    "we limit the current in the dipole coils to 15  a , beyond which heating becomes too important . with this value , a bias @xmath19 and a curvature @xmath20 of respectively 54  g and 150  g/@xmath21",
    "are obtained for the dipole and 49  g and 68  g/@xmath21 for the anti - dipole ( see fig .  [ figdipplusantidip ] ) .",
    "the total bias can thus be varied from 54 to 5  gauss .",
    "the modulus of the magnetic field created by the electromagnet is then given by :    @xmath22    _ dynamical properties _",
    "the dynamical characteristics of the electromagnet are also of a great interest since it is necessary to be able to switch on and off the magnetic field in times shorter than the oscillation period of the trap .",
    "there are two important reasons for this condition .",
    "the first one is that we wish to transfer the atoms from the magneto - optical trap to the magnetic trap without losing in density .",
    "the second reason is due to the way we image the atomic cloud : it is released from the trap and expands ballistically before being illuminated by a near - resonant probe beam ( absorption imaging @xcite ) . from the images ,",
    "we can deduce temperature , density and the number of trapped atoms .    to avoid eddy currents in the ferromagnetic structure , which would limit switching times , we use a laminated material .",
    "it is worth noting that the shape of the present quadrupole is simple enough to be easily produced by assembling inexpensive laser - cut sheets of ferromagnetic material .",
    "it consists of 100  @xmath23 thick iron - silicium plates , each isolated from the other .",
    "to control the switching times , we use a capacitor @xmath24 in series with the coils of inductance @xmath25 . to turn on the magnetic field ,",
    "the capacitors ( @xmath26 ) are first loaded with a high voltage supply @xmath27 .",
    "then the energy @xmath28 accumulated in the capacitors is transferred to the coils in a time equal to @xmath29 , i.e. a quarter of a period of the oscillating circuit .",
    "then , the power supply takes over .",
    "the same idea applies to the procedure to switch off the magnetic field , but now , the switch off current will charge a capacitor called @xmath30 which limits overvoltage in the circuit at switch off . for our setup , the switching time is @xmath31 .",
    "the electronic circuit used for the quadrupole is presented in fig .",
    "[ figcircquad ] . for the dipolar coils ( fig .  [ figcircdip ] ) , the switching procedure is the same , but now we also ramp the current in  anti - dipole \" coils by using mosfet so as to precisely adjust the bias at a low value @xmath19 without decreasing the curvature @xmath20 .    _",
    "cancelling of the remnant magnetic field _    to generate the compensating field in order to cancel remnant fields , two thin coils ( 1 mm diameter wire ) have been rolled on the two quadrupole exciting coils .",
    "they have thus the same configuration and the compensation field automatically possesses the right geometry to cancel the remnant field . the procedure to find the compensation current is quite simple .",
    "we adjust the current after having cooled atoms into a magneto - optical trap @xcite and then cut the mot magnetic field . if the compensating current is too high or too low , the remnant field provokes a rotation of the atomic cloud , a situation which can be compared to the mechanical hanle effect @xcite . at the right value , there is no rotation anymore , which can be seen by observing fluorescence along the x axis .",
    "we should stress the point that the remnant fields are so easy to compensate only because we limited the ferromagnetic structure to the quadrupolar plane so as to suppress coupling between quadrupole and dipole .",
    "in order to trap the atoms , the electromagnet is placed around a 1 cm square section parallelepipedic glass vacuum cell ( see fig .  [ figbobines ] ) .",
    "the atoms are first loaded into a magneto - optical trap whose magnetic field is produced by two thin printed circuits ( 400 @xmath32 m thick ) positioned along the @xmath33 direction . on each one",
    "are imprinted 6.5 loops which are 1 mm wide and 35 micrometers thick , such that the full resistance is 1 @xmath34 . a current of 2  a in those circuits generates a spherical quadrupole field with an axial gradient of 15  gauss / cm .",
    "a slave laser , injected by a grating stabilized diode laser , produces the six independent circularly polarized trapping beams with a diameter of one centimeter .",
    "the mot sequence ends with an optical molasses @xcite phase during which the spherical quadrupole field is switched off and the laser frequency is detuned .",
    "it is important that there is no residual magnetic field -bias or gradient- during the molasses phase so as not to disturb the sub - doppler cooling mechanism . to ensure this requirement , three pairs of coils (  molasses coils \" in fig .",
    "[ figbobines ] ) are placed along the three axes to compensate any residual fields ( terrestrial field , ionic pump field ... ) additional to remnants fields .",
    "we obtain @xmath35 atoms at @xmath36k after the molasses .",
    "after the molasses phase , the atoms are optically transferred into the @xmath37 hyperfine state , in which only the @xmath38 sublevel experiences an attractive potential which can be harmonically approximated around the minimum of the magnetic field with the following trapping frequencies : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the land factor and @xmath41 the bohr magneton .",
    "the values of the trap parameters are presented in table  [ tablecaract ] .",
    "8.5cml@ * 5c @ trap & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 + ncipt & 54 & 150 & 200 & 2 @xmath47 15 & 2 @xmath47 11 + cipt & 5 & 82 & 830 & 2 @xmath47 330 & 2 @xmath47 8    the magnetic ioffe - pritchard trap ( ipt ) is switched on by applying a current of 15  a in the dipole coils and 5  a in the quadrupole exciting coils .",
    "these values are selected so that the size of the two traps -mot and ipt- are well matched . moreover",
    ", the centers of the two traps have to overlap , otherwise the atoms will acquire a larger energy during the transfer . to adjust the relative position of the trap centers , we have added two pairs of coils in a helmholtz configuration in series with the mot s coil .",
    "they act on the field in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 directions .",
    "variable resistances are added in parallel to the three pairs of coils ( including the mot coils ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ figpositioning ] , allowing for tuning of the current in the positioning coils .",
    "the mot , which will be centered around the zero of the magnetic field , can now be placed appropriately using the positioning coils system described above .",
    "it is to be noted that the right values for each resistance must be found following an iterative method . by moving the center of the mot , as explained above",
    ", the magnetic environment is slightly modified and the molasses coils need to be fine tuned .",
    "this in turn displaces the mot and we have to center the cloud again .    after having transfered the atoms into the ipt , current in the quadrupole",
    "is increased to 60  a and the current in the anti - dipole coils is slowly ramped up . at this point ,",
    "the quadrupole field gradient reaches 830  g / cm and the bias is reduced to 5  gauss .",
    "this provides a tight trap for which the collision rate is around 60  s@xmath50 , more than one order of magnitude larger than before compression .",
    "the compression of the trap is adiabatically done in one second in order to minimize the loss of phase space density .",
    "compression time is thus chosen larger than the oscillation time and the rethermalization time .",
    "current values at each stage are summarized in fig .",
    "[ figcyclemag ] . at this stage",
    ", we obtain typically @xmath51 atoms at @xmath52k i.e. a phase space density of @xmath53 .",
    "finally , evaporative cooling of the atoms is performed by radio - frequency ( rf ) induced spin flips .",
    "the rf magnetic field is produced by the mot coils ( fig .",
    "[ figpositioning ] ) , in which the rf current now flows in the same direction for both coils such that the field is nearly homogeneous on the atoms .",
    "it is applied perpendicular to the ipt magnetic field at the center of the trap .",
    "then , the radiofrequency is swept from 70  mhz to a final value of around 4.2  mhz .",
    "[ figtransitionimg ] shows images of cooled atomic clouds after 25  ms of ballistic expansion for different final values of the ramp .",
    "the sudden appearence of the bec can be seen in the density profile measured by absorption imaging along the x axis , as the distribution becomes bimodal .",
    "the distribution of thermal atoms is gaussian and is represented by a dashed line in the profiles , whereas the distribution of condensed atoms is an inverted parabola ( in the thomas - fermi approximation)@xcite . for decreasing temperatures ( lower final rf frequency )",
    ", the fraction of thermal atoms decreases and at sufficiently low temperatures , we obtain a pure condensate containing @xmath54 atoms .",
    "one efficient way to check the stability of the bias created by the electromagnet is to produce atom lasers by radio - frequency outcoupling @xcite(fig .",
    "[ atomlas ] ) and mesure the spectral width of the condensate .",
    "the principle of weak radio - frequency outcoupled atom lasers has been developped in @xcite .",
    "main features are summarized in figure [ atomlasprinciple ] .",
    "the condensate is displaced from the center of the magnetic field due to gravity .",
    "thus , it crosses magnetic equipotentials in the vertical direction only .    by applying",
    "radio - frequency one flips the spin of atoms from the trapped state @xmath55 to the untrapped one @xmath56 .",
    "the wave falls under the effect of gravity into the continuum of airy functions @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to an atom laser since the source ( the condensate ) is fully coherent @xcite .",
    "the radio - frequency value @xmath57 is directly related to the difference in energy between the two involved states : @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for the potential energy of outcoupled atoms and depends on the extrating point @xmath60 , @xmath32 and @xmath61 , respectively the chemical potential and the magnetic potential energy of the bec . for a given radiofrequency , fluctuations of the coupling zone",
    "are only related to bias fluctuations through @xmath61 .    to quantitavely give an estimation on the stability of the experiment , we have to determine the spectral width of the condensate . for a given weak radio - frequency power",
    ", we have measured the number of extracted atoms as a function of the value of the rf knife ( experimental points in figure [ width ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the number @xmath62 of extracted atoms is proportional to the number of condensed atoms on the surface @xmath63 defined by the rf value @xmath57 ( i.e. one neglects the effect of interactions on the coupling rate @xcite ) .",
    "taking a thomas - fermi profile for the condensate leads to :    @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the difference between outcoupling radio - frequency and its value in the center of the bec , @xmath66 and @xmath67 being respectively the coordinate and the thomas - fermi radius of the dimension @xmath68 .",
    "the surface @xmath63 corresponding to the radiofrequency knife resonance condition is defined by : @xmath69    if we assume that fluctuations are gaussian with r.m.s value @xmath70 , the final output flux is the convolution between this noise and @xmath62 :    @xmath71    we have fitted the experimental data with @xmath72 as shown in figure [ width ] , and we obtain @xmath731.5  khz .",
    "this broadening could come from bias variations during one scan .    in order to look more precisely for the different timescales involved in these fluctuations ,",
    "we have fixed the rf outcoupler at a detuning of @xmath74 and we have looked at the long term drift and fluctuations of the number of outcoupled atoms .",
    "once we have deduced the effects of atom number fluctuations in the original bec ( @xmath75 ) , we have measured a drift of @xmath76 and r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations of @xmath77 which correspond to shot to shot bias fluctuations of @xmath78 .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that the rapid fluctuations are also of the order of @xmath79 , which is sufficient to produce stable quasi - continuous atom lasers as one can see on figure [ atomlas ] .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the realization of a new generation hybrid electromagnet designed to produce large bose - einstein condensates containing one million rubidium atoms . due to the compact ferromagnetic design ( 20  cm diameter )",
    "one achieves gradients as large as 830  g / cm which are sufficient to compress the atomic cloud for an efficient runaway evaporative cooling . the total power consumption is less than 800  w which is easy to dissipate . due to the lamellar structure of the ferromagnetic core and the driving electronic circuit ,",
    "eddy currents are suppressed and the switching time is reduced to 150  @xmath32s .",
    "the high stability of the bias ( fluctuations measured to be of the order of @xmath80 ) enables us to produce stable radio - frequency outcoupled quasi - continuous atom lasers .",
