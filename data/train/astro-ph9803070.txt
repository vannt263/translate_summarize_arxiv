    "neutron stars have a high enough interior density as to make phase transitions in the nature of nuclear matter a distinct possibility . according to the qcd property of asymptotic freedom ,",
    "the most plausible is the quark deconfinement transition . according to lattice qcd simulations ,",
    "this phase transition is expected to occur in very hot ( @xmath1 mev ) or cold but dense matter .",
    "since neutron stars are born with almost the highest density that they will have in their lifetime , being very little deformed by centrifugal forces , they will possess cores of the high density phase essentially from birth if the critical density falls in the range of neutron stars .",
    "however the global properties such as mass or size of a slowly rotating neutron star are little effected by whether or not it has a more compressible phase in the core . in principle , cooling rates should depend on interior composition , but cooling calculations are beset by many uncertainties and competing assumptions about composition can yield similar cooling rates depending on other assumptions about superconductivity and the cooling processes .",
    "moreover , for those stars for which a rate has been measured , not a single mass is known .",
    "it is unlikely that these measurements will yield conclusive evidence in the present state of uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , it may be possible to observe the phase transition in millisecond pulsars by the easiest of measurements  the sign of @xmath2",
    ". the sign should be negative corresponding to loss of angular momentum by radiation .",
    "however , as we will show , a phase transition , either first or second order , that occurs near or at the limiting mass star , can cause spin - up during a substantial era compared to the spin - down time of millisecond pulsars .",
    "we sketch the conventional evolutionary history of millisecond pulsars with the addition of the supposition that the critical density for quark deconfinement falls in the density range spanned by neutron stars .",
    "as already remarked , with this supposition , the star has a quark core from birth but its properties are so little effected that this fact can not be discerned in members of the canonical pulsar population .",
    "however , by some mechanism , usually assumed to be accretion from a companion during the radio silent epoch following its @xmath3 year spin down as a canonical pulsar , the neutron star may be spun up .",
    "as it spins up , it becomes increasingly centrifugally deformed and its interior density falls .",
    "consequently , the radius at which the critical phase transition density occurs moves toward the center of the star ",
    "quarks recombine to form hadrons . when accretion ceases , and if the neutron star has been spun up to a state in which the combination of reduced field strength and increased frequency turn the dipole radiation on again , the pulsar recommences spin - down as a visible millisecond pulsar .    during spin - down the central density increases with decreasing centrifugal force .",
    "first at the center of the star , and then in an expanding region , the highly compressible quark matter will replace the less compressible nuclear matter .",
    "the quark core , weighed down by the overlaying layers of nuclear matter is compressed to high density , and the increased central concentration of mass acts on the overlaying nuclear matter , compressing it further .",
    "the resulting decrease in the moment of inertia causes the star to spin up to conserve angular momentum not carried off by radiation .",
    "the phenomenon is analogous to that of `` backbending '' predicted for rotating nuclei ( mottelson and valatin 1960 ) and discovered in the 1970 s ( johnson et.al .",
    "1972 , stephens and simon 1972 ) ( see fig .  [ nucleus ] ) in nuclei , it was established that the change in phase is from a particle spin - aligned state at high nuclear angular momentum to a superfluid state at low angular momentum .",
    "the phenomenon is also analogous to an ice skater who commences a spin with arms outstretched .",
    "initially spin decreases because of friction and air resistance , but a period of spin - up is achieved by pulling the arms in .",
    "friction then reestablishes spin - down . in all three examples , spin up",
    "is a consequence of a decrease in moment of inertia beyond what would occur in response to decreasing angular velocity .",
    "in our calculation , nuclear matter was described in a relativistically covariant theory ( garpman , glendenning and karant 1979 , glendenning 1985 , glendenning and moszkowski 1991 ) and quark matter in the mit bag model ( chodos et.al .",
    "the phase transition occurs in a substance of two conserved quantities , electric charge and baryon number , and must be found in the way described in ref .",
    "( glendenning 1992 ) .",
    "the moment of inertia must incorporate all effects described above  changes in composition of matter , centrifugal stretching  and frame dragging , all within the framework of general relativity .",
    "the expression derived by hartle is inadequate because it neglects these effects ( hartle and thorne 1968 ) .",
    "rather we must use the expression derived by us ( glendenning and weber 1992a , 1992b ) .       for fixed baryon number",
    "we solve general relativity  for a star rotating at a sequence of angular momenta corresponding to an equation of state  that describes the deconfinement phase transition from charge neutral nuclear matter to quark matter . the equation of state  is shown in fig .",
    "[ eos ] the moment of inertia as a function of angular momentum does not decrease monotonically as it would for a gravitating fluid of constant composition .",
    "rather , as described above , the epoch over which an enlarging central region of the star enters the more compressible phase is marked by spin - up ( fig .",
    "to estimate the duration of the spin - up , we solve the deceleration equation for the star with moment of inertia having the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ oi ] .    from the energy loss equation @xmath4 for magnetic dipole radiation",
    "we find @xmath5^{-1 } \\omega^3\\ , .",
    "\\label{braking2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression reduces to the usual braking equation when the moment of inertia is held fixed .",
    "the braking index is not constant but varies with angular velocity and therefore time according to @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this holds in general even for a star whose internal composition does not change with angular velocity ( inconceivable ) .",
    "in particular one can see that for very high frequency , the derivatives will be largest and the braking index for any millisecond pulsar near the kepler frequency will be less than the dipole value of @xmath9 .",
    "the braking index is shown as a function of time in fig .",
    "[ nt ] an anomalous value endures for @xmath10 years corresponding to the slow spin down of the pulsar and the corresponding slow envelopment of a growing central region by the new phase .",
    "the two points that go to infinity correspond to the infinite derivatives of @xmath11 at which according to ( [ braking2 ] ) , the deceleration vanishes .",
    "they mark the spin - up era .",
    "the actual spin - up lasts for @xmath0 years or 1/50 of the spin - down time for this pulsar .",
    "this could be easily observed in a solitary pulsar and would likely signal a phase transition .",
    "we have found the spin - up phenomenon in a pulsar model for which the change in phase occurs in a star near the maximum mass .",
    "the phase transition can be first or second order as long as it is accompanied by a sufficient softening of the equation of state .",
    "we have not quantified the meaning of `` sufficiently soft '' .",
    "if no pulsar is observed to produce the signal , little is learned .",
    "just as in nuclear collisions , failure to observe a signal does not inform us that the deconfined phase does not or can not exist . + this work was supported by the director , office of energy research , office of high energy and nuclear physics , division of nuclear physics , of the u.s .",
