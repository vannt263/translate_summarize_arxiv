    "the evolution equation for single diffractive dissociation in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) was derived in @xcite .",
    "first we write the cross section for single diffractive dissociation in dis on a nucleus as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the net rapidity interval and the rapidity gap stretches from rapidity @xmath2 to rapidity @xmath3 with @xmath4 the invariant mass of the produced hadrons .",
    "@xmath5 is the order-@xmath6 light - cone wave function squared for a virtual photon fluctuating into a @xmath7 pair with @xmath8 the transverse size of the pair and @xmath9 the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the incoming virtual photon carried by the quark in the pair .",
    "the object @xmath10 is the `` @xmath11-matrix '' for single diffractive dissociation , which includes both interacting and non - interacting contributions in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude with the rapidity gap greater than or equal to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the object @xmath10 obeys a nonlinear evolution equation , which is equivalent to the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) @xcite evolution equation @xcite : @xmath13.\\ ] ] the equation is illustrated in .",

    "is given by @xmath14 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the ( imaginary part ) of the forward dipole ",
    "nucleus scattering amplitude obeying the standard bk evolution equation .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the fact that @xmath10 obeys the bk evolution results from the cancellation of final state gluon emissions : no @xmath16-channel gluon emitted or absorbed after the interaction with the target ( to the right of the dashed line in the amplitude and to the left of the dashed line in the complex conjugate amplitude ) remains in the final evolution pictured in . without the final state gluon emissions / absorptions , the evolution becomes just like that for a forward amplitude , that is , a bk evolution .",
    "the same property remains valid when the running coupling corrections are included @xcite : these corrections also cancel in the final state . hence , the running - coupling evolution equation for diffractive dissociation is equivalent to the running - coupling bk ( rcbk ) evolution equation , with the initial condition now containing the dipole amplitude @xmath15 evolved by the full rcbk evolution .",
    "we thus write the running - coupling evolution equation for @xmath10 as @xcite @xmath17\\ ] ] where the evolution kernel was calculated in @xcite . for completeness let us show the kernel in the balitsky prescription @xcite : @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 .",
    "can be used to describe the dis diffraction data with large center - of - mass energy squared @xmath16 and large @xmath4 , such that @xmath20 .",
    "unfortunately current hera data does not extend to high enough values of @xmath4 to necessitate the use of : perhaps this equation would be useful to describe single diffraction at the future dis machines such as the proposed eic and lhec colliders .",
    "the progress in the calculation of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) intercept of the qcd odderon was presented in the talk by jochen bartels at the diffraction 2012 workshop ( reporting on work being done in collaboration with victor fadin and lev lipatov ) .",
    "the calculation employs standard feynman diagram approach .",
    "here we would like to document a prediction for the nlo odderon intercept made by the author of these proceedings in the discussion following the talk : the nlo odderon intercept can be straightforwardly obtained using the @xmath16-channel time - ordered formalism usually employed in saturation physics .",
    "the odderon exchange amplitude in dis is @xcite @xmath21 -   \\mathrm{tr } \\ , \\left [ v_{\\bf y }   \\ , v^\\dagger_{\\bf x } \\right ] \\right\\rangle   = \\frac{1}{2i } \\ ,   \\left [ n_{{\\bf y } , { \\bf x } } - n_{{\\bf x } , { \\bf y } } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a wilson line along the light - cone of the projectile dipole located at transverse coordinate @xmath23 and @xmath24/n_c\\right\\rangle$ ] is the dipole ",
    "nucleus forward scattering amplitude .    to construct the nlo evolution equation for @xmath25 we begin with the linearized nlo bk evolution for @xmath26 derived in @xcite ( that is , the nlo balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite in transverse coordinate space ) , which can be written as ( see eq .  ( 103 ) in @xcite ) @xmath27 + \\int d^2 z \\",
    ", d^2 z ' \\ , k_2",
    "( { \\bf x } , { \\bf y } ; { \\bf z } , { \\bf z } ' ) \\ , n_{{\\bf z } , { \\bf z}'}.\\ ] ] the kernels @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be found in eq .",
    "( 103 ) of @xcite .",
    "one can explicitly verify that @xmath30 using these properties of the kernels , along with eqs .   and , we derive the nlo evolution equation for the odderon amplitude , which turns out to be equivalent to : @xmath31 + \\int d^2 z \\ , d^2 z ' \\",
    ", k_2 ( { \\bf x } , { \\bf y } ; { \\bf z } , { \\bf z } ' ) \\ , o_{{\\bf z } , { \\bf z}'}.\\ ] ] we see that the situation closely replicates that for the odderon evolution in transverse coordinate space at the leading order ( lo ) @xcite : there the odderon evolution equation was also identical to the ( lo ) bfkl equation , with the eigenfunctions of the odderon evolution operator being @xmath32-odd , that is , they had to flip sign under the @xmath33 interchange .",
    "the same observation applies here at nlo : since the odderon amplitude @xmath34 obeys the same nlo bfkl evolution equation , the odderon intercept is the same as the nlo bfkl intercept , with only odd values of the azimuthal index @xmath35 contributing .",
    "( note that , strictly speaking , to obtain which is equivalent to nlo bfkl one has to redefine the dipole amplitude by an order-@xmath36 correction with the corresponding new operator referred to as the composite dipole in @xcite : using this operator in place of @xmath15 would not change the derivation above . )",
    "the nlo bfkl intercept for non - zero @xmath35 can be found in e.g. @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( 65 ) there ) .",
    "evaluating it for @xmath37 at the saddle point @xmath38 we obtain zero and @xmath39 had been originally observed by agustin sabio vera during the discussion of the odderon evolution at the diffraction 2012 workshop ( see also eq .  ( 38 ) in @xcite ) , and was since confirmed by the author . ] , such that the nlo odderon intercept in qcd is @xmath40 we conclude that the zero value of the odderon intercept , originally found at the leading - order in @xcite , persists at the nlo .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as was pointed out by lipatov in the discussion at the workshop , the odderon intercept at strong t hooft coupling @xmath41 was found in @xcite using the anti - de sitter space / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence .",
    "the authors of @xcite found two odderon solutions , both of which give @xmath42 for @xmath43 , with one of the solutions exhibiting no deviation from zero when finite-@xmath44 corrections were calculated , such that @xmath45 .",
    "this result , along with our , presents evidence in favor of a tantalizing possibility that the odderon intercept is identically equal to zero at all values of the coupling ! ( the same reference @xcite states that the result had been known earlier to cyrille marquet , who , as it turns out , arrived at it numerically using a similar line of arguments to the one presented here . )    the author is greatly indebted to ian balitsky and giovanni chirilli for discussions of the nlo bk evolution .",
