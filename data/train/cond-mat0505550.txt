    "quantum bose and fermi gases of ultracold atoms continue to attract considerable interest since the experimental realization of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite and the pair condensation of fermionic atoms @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been paid to one - dimensional ( @xmath1d ) bose gases , which are seen to exhibit the rich and novel effects of quantum many - body systems @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", there has been a revival of interest in the exactly solved @xmath1d model of interacting bosons .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0-function interacting bose gas is integrable @xcite and can be realized via short - range interactions with an effective coupling constant @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this constant is determined through an effective @xmath1d scattering length @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the characteristic length along the transverse direction and @xmath5 is the @xmath6d scattering length .",
    "the ratio of the average interaction energy to the kinetic energy , @xmath7 , is used to characterize the different physical regimes of the @xmath1d quantum gas . here",
    "@xmath8 is the atomic mass and @xmath9 is the boson number density . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath10 , the wave functions of the bosons are coherent . in this regime ,",
    "the density fluctuations are suppressed and the phase correlations decay algebraically at low temperatures .",
    "thus the @xmath1d bose gas can undergo a quasi bec .",
    "however , in the opposite limit , i.e. , the tonks - girardeau limit @xmath11 , the bosons behave like impenetrable hard core particles , the so called tonks - girardeau gas @xcite . in this regime",
    "the single - particle wave functions become decoherent and the system acquires fermionic properties .",
    "the @xmath1d bose gas is realized experimentally by tightly confining the atomic cloud in two ( radial ) dimensions and weakly confining it along the axial direction .",
    "the motion along the radial direction is then frozen to zero point oscillations @xcite , making the gas effectively one - dimensional .",
    "anisotropic trapping along the radial and axial directions can form either a @xmath12d optical lattice or @xmath1d tubes .",
    "there have been two types of @xmath1d quantum gases , the lattice bose gas @xcite and the continuum bose gas confined in a harmonic potential along the axial direction @xcite ( see ) . from a theoretical point of view , the former is usually described by the bose - hubbard model while the latter is described by the @xmath1d interacting bose gas .",
    "the bose - hubbard model is not integrable , except for a special case @xcite , which corresponds to two sites . on the other hand ,",
    "the trapping potential along the axial direction breaks the integrability of the @xmath1d bose gas .",
    "however , the long - wavelength properties of the @xmath1d bose gas and the bose - hubbard model can be described by a luttinger liquid , owing to the universality of the low energy excitations , i.e. , gapless excitations with a linear low - energy excitation spectrum and power - law decay in the correlations @xcite .",
    "the exactly solved @xmath1d interacting bose gas has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy and low energy excitations @xcite , thermodynamic behaviour @xcite , finite - size effects @xcite , correlation functions @xcite and luttinger liquid behaviour @xcite have been investigated via various methods .",
    "the signature of the @xmath1d bose gas is strongly influenced by the interaction strength and the external trapping potential .",
    "the effects of spatial inhomogeneity and finite temperature are other considerations to be taken into account under experimental conditions . to this end",
    ", several approximation schemes have been adopted to describe the main features of the @xmath1d trapped bose gas . in particular , the local density approximation @xcite is widely used for calculating the density profiles of bosons and fermions in harmonic traps .",
    "now for a finite number of bosons and finite system size , boundary effects are expected to be pronounced at low temperature @xcite .",
    "indeed , significantly different quantum effects should be exhibited by a finite number of bosons confined in a finite hard wall box .",
    "for example , in the weak coupling regime , macroscopic states lie on the zero point oscillations as if the system undergoes bec .",
    "the density expectation value exhibits friedel oscillations and the correlation decay is slower than in the periodic case , due to the enhancement of the density and phase stiffness .",
    "the boundary conditions also have an effect on the phase correlations near the boundaries .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath1d interacting bose gas with hard wall boundary conditions has no momentum pairing ( with a @xmath13 for each @xmath14 ) compared to the period case , because of the missing translational symmetry .",
    "the hard wall boundary conditions have been experimentally realized by square potentials with very high barriers @xcite .",
    "most recently , bec have been produced in a novel optical box trap @xcite , in which atom numbers are as small as @xmath15 .",
    "more experiments in this direction can be anticipated @xcite .",
    "these are our motivations for studying the ground state properties of the @xmath1d interacting bose gas confined in a hard wall box .",
    "the @xmath1d interacting bose gas with hard wall boundaries was solved by gaudin in the early 1970 s @xcite .",
    "gaudin calculated the surface energy via the bethe ansatz solution in the thermodynamic limit . very recently , this model was studied via haldane s harmonic liquid theory @xcite , which describes the long wave - length properties of the @xmath1d fluid in terms of the density and phase fluctuations .",
    "the correlation functions of the tonks - girardeau gas have also been studied with hard wall boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ ba ] , we present the bethe ansatz wave functions and bethe equations for the @xmath1d interacting bose gas with hard wall boundary conditions . details of the bethe ansatz solution are given in appendix a. in section [ as ] , we derive the ground state energy via asymptotic roots of the bethe equations in the strong and weak coupling limits .",
    "we derive the surface energy through the continuum integral equations in section [ tdl ] . in section [ wpsem ]",
    ", we calculate the ground state energy in the strong and weak coupling limits using wadati s power series expansion method @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the connection between the @xmath1d bose gas trapped by an harmonic potential and the exactly solved model is given in section [ lda ] .",
    "the low - energy properties are discussed in section [ sec : ll ] , with concluding remarks given in .",
    "the @xmath1d quantum gas of @xmath16 bosons with @xmath0-function interaction in a hard wall box of length @xmath17 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath18 where the hard walls are defined via the boundary conditions @xcite @xmath19 here @xmath20 is an effective @xmath1d coupling constant with scattering strength @xmath21 .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath22 must be totally symmetric in all its arguments , as required for a bosonic system .    for harmonic trapping along the axial direction ,",
    "the scattering strength is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the trapping potential should be added to the hamiltonian as an external field . however , harmonic potentials appear to break the integrability of the model .",
    "fortunately the integrability of the model is preserved by the hard wall boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this provides us with an opportunity to study the signature of the @xmath1d bose gas in a hard wall box in an exact fashion . for simplicity , we set @xmath24 in the following .",
    "the explicit solution of the model via the coordinate bethe ansatz is described in appendix a. the wavefunction is given by @xmath25 where the sum extends over all @xmath26 permutations @xmath27 and all signs @xmath28 ( see appendix a ) . the wavefunction is valid in the domain @xmath29 and can be continued via symmetry in all coordinates @xmath30 .",
    "the wavefunction coefficients @xmath31 are determined by the bethe roots , or wave numbers , @xmath32 via @xmath33 in the above equation @xmath34 denotes a @xmath35 sign factor associated with even / odd permutations .",
    "the wave numbers satisfy the bethe equations @xmath36 the energy eigenvalues are as usual given by @xmath37 like the periodic boundary condition case @xcite , the bethe roots @xmath32 are known to be real for repulsive interactions ( @xmath38 ) , but they may become complex for attractive interactions ( @xmath39 ) . here",
    "we consider the repulsive regime .",
    "free bosons are recovered for @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "in this appendix we present the coordinate bethe ansatz solution of the 1d interacting bose gas with hard wall boundary conditions .",
    "the general form of the wavefunction is that of the spin-@xmath216 heisenberg chain with open boundaries and additional surface terms @xcite .",
    "first we consider the standard one particle in a box case , @xmath217 , for which the wave function is @xmath218 from the hard wall boundary conditions , we have @xmath219 and @xmath220 . the energy is @xmath221 .",
    "thus , up to an overall constant , the wave function is @xmath222 , with quasi momentum @xmath223 , where @xmath9 is a non - zero integer .",
    "this describes a trapped particle which has a discrete energy spectrum .",
    "if @xmath17 is infinitely large , the particle becomes free and the enery levels will be continuous .",

    "observe that for @xmath40 , the wave function reduces to the standing wave @xmath235 , with @xmath236 and @xmath237 for @xmath238 and @xmath239 non - zero integers .",
    "when @xmath21 increases , @xmath240 and @xmath241 also increase as if the boson mass increases .",
    "the standing wave properties are gradually lost as the interaction becomes stronger .    in a similar way , we can derive the @xmath16-particle wave function given in .",
    "the coefficients are connected to each other via @xmath242 for @xmath243 .",
    "application of the boundary conditions leads to the explicit form of the coefficients given in , along with the bethe equations .",

    "in contrast with periodic boundary conditions , the ground state no longer contains @xmath42 momentum pairs due to the reflection of quasi momenta at the boundaries . as a result",
    "the total quasi momentum @xmath43 is not conserved in this case .",
    "we first examine the asymptotic solutions of the bethe equations in the strong and weak coupling limits .",
    "it is well known that in the strong coupling regime , i.e. , @xmath11 , the @xmath1d bose gas with repulsive interaction behaves like a gas of weakly interacting fermions @xcite . in the limiting case @xmath44",

    "the asymptotic bethe roots @xmath52 for the ground state energy follow from the condition that the eqns be consistent .",

    "we will compare the ground state energy with numerical solutions of the continuum integral equation , which is the hard - wall analogue of the lieb - liniger integral equation , in section [ tdl ] .",
    "the explicit form for the wave numbers @xmath54 also allows an in principle calculation of the asymptotic correlation functions directly from the wave function .",
    "switching back to real physical units , the ground state energy per particle can also be written as @xmath55 here the bulk energy @xmath56 and the surface energy @xmath57 are given by @xmath58    a useful quantity is the @xmath1d temperature @xmath59 , which is just the ground state energy in different units @xcite .",

    "the dashed horizontal lines are the corresponding values of @xmath60 in the tonks - girardeau limit .",
    "we remark that for hard wall boundary conditions , the particle density distribution is rather flat and homogeneous .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath60 increases rapidly as @xmath61 increases in the weak coupling regime .",
    "it then slowly approaches the tonks - girardeau energy as @xmath61 tends to infinity . in an actual experiment",
    ", the length of the atomic cloud varies with the interaction strength . in that case",
    "the @xmath60 will increase smoothly as @xmath61 increases .",
    "most significantly , @xmath60 is sensitive to the length of the hard wall box .",
    "the smaller the length of the box , the larger the ` quasi - momentum ' of the particles .",
    "we note also that the surface energy is positive . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the ground state energy for periodic boundary conditions is proportional to the linear density @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , in the thermodynamic limit , the ground state energy per particle of the bose gas in a hard wall box can be considered as an excited state of a bose gas with @xmath66 particles in a periodic box of length @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "we will study the ground state properties for the hard wall box further in section [ tdl ] .",

    "the inset shows the @xmath1d temperatures in the regime @xmath71 . ]",
    "the ground state properties in the weak coupling limit are both subtle and interesting .",
    "so far it has proved difficult to reach the weak coupling regime via anisotropic trapping in experiments @xcite and it is necessary to sharply define the criterion for weak coupling @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "the @xmath1d regime is reached if the radial zero point oscillation length @xmath72 is much smaller than the axial correlation length @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the frequency of the radial trap and @xmath64 is the chemical potential of the @xmath1d system , thus the condition is @xmath75 for the @xmath1d trapped system . in general , @xmath76 at zero temperature is referred to as the weak coupling regime .",
    "the thomas - fermi regime is usually reached for @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the axial oscillation frequency for the harmonic trap . in this regime",
    "the kinetic energy term can be neglected and the system has a parabolic density distribution profile @xcite , referred to as the thomas - fermi bec . however , in the regime @xmath79 the system is considered to have a macroscopic occupation in the ground state of the trap with a gaussian density profile @xcite .",
    "for the hard wall boundary conditions , the leading terms in the ground state energy can be obtained through asymptotic solutions of the bethe equations in analogy with the periodic case @xcite . here",
    "the wave numbers @xmath54 for the ground state satisfy the algebraic equations @xmath80 algebraic equations for periodic boundary conditions have arisen in a number of different contexts @xcite , most notably in the integrable bcs pairing models @xcite .",
    "the roots of such equations also describe the equilibrium positions of potentials in calogero systems associated with lie algebras @xcite .",
    "the solutions of give the ground state energy @xmath81 this is quite different from the periodic boundary case , for which the leading term in the ground state energy per particle is @xmath82 . here",
    ", due to the reflections at the boundaries , the ground state energy for hard wall boundary conditions is larger than the energy for periodic boundary conditions . for the integrable @xmath1d bose gas with periodic boundary conditions , the ground state energy per particle",

    "this discrepancy is not totally unexpected , as the lieb - liniger integral equation is only valid up to terms of order @xmath90 .",
    "if the interaction energy is much smaller than the scale of @xmath90 , i.e. , if @xmath91 , results derived from the lieb - liniger integral equation are no longer valid in this very weak coupling regime . on the other hand , in the regime @xmath92 the zero point oscillation kinetic energy is much smaller than the interaction energy and is thus negligible  it is here that one can derive the ground state energy asymptotically from the continuum integral equation .",
    "finite - size discrepancies between the discrete and integral equation approaches have also been noted in ref .",
    "taking the logarithm on both sides of the bethe equations gives @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are ordered positive integers , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "here for later convenience we have denoted the bethe roots by @xmath97 .",
    "our calculation takes advantage of the fact that in the thermodynamic limit , the ground state energy of the @xmath16 boson system in a box of length @xmath17 is equivalent to one half the energy of @xmath66 bosons with length @xmath67 and periodic boundary conditions , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "it is thus convenient to derive the surface energy from a periodic system of @xmath66 bosons with a length @xmath67 , for which the bethe equations are @xcite @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 are half - odd integers .",
    "we now introduce the notation @xmath101 and @xmath102 . the difference between @xmath103 and @xmath54",
    "can thus be written as @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is a sign factor .",
    "the surface energy is given by @xmath107 using @xmath108 and taking the taylor expansion of equations at @xmath109 gives @xmath110 it follows that @xmath111 let us define @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the distribution function @xcite , then the bethe equations become @xmath114 here we use the density @xmath115 and define the cut - off momentum @xmath116 .",
    "subsequently , equation becomes @xmath117 here @xmath118 . further defining @xmath119 ,",
    "the surface energy is given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 satisfies the integral equation @xmath122    after the same rescaling as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath123 , we find the ground state energy per particle to be of the form .",
    "the bulk and surface energies are given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 with the cut - off condition @xmath126",
    "as remarked in references @xcite , the lieb - liniger integral equation is closely related to the love equation for the problem of a circular plate condensator @xcite .",
    "one can obtain a series expansion for the ground state energy from the integral equation @xcite .",
    "this method has also been applied to the yang - yang integral equations for the thermodynamics @xcite and to the gaudin integral equation for the attractive @xmath0-function interacting fermi gas @xcite . for the bose gas with hard walls ,",
    "gaudin @xcite found the leading surface energy term in the weakly interacting limit . in this section",
    ", we apply the wadati method to obtain the leading terms in the ground state energy from the integral equations and .      in the strong coupling regime the bulk part of the ground state energy per particle",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath127 which agrees with the asymptotic result .",

    "again this is because the continuum integral equation derived from the bethe equations is only valid for terms of order up to @xmath90 .      in this regime the leading terms of the distribution function",
    "are found to be @xmath131 the surface energy @xmath132 follows from equation .",
    "here we keep only the leading term , as for a large number of particles , the contribution from other terms is negligible .",
    "the ground state energy per particle in the regime @xmath85 is again of the form where the leading bulk and surface energy terms are @xmath133    so far we have derived some analytic results for the ground state energy of the interacting @xmath1d bose gas with hard wall boundary conditions .",
    "one may also perform direct numerical calculations using the integral equations and , as originally done in the bulk @xcite . in doing this",
    "we see that the ground state energy , with and , is consistent with the result obtained from the the integral equations and for @xmath134 , with best agreement found for @xmath135 ( see ) .",
    "a comparison between the analytic result and numerical calculation for weak coupling is presented in figure [ fig : e0f - weak ] .",

    "the experimental realization of the tonks - girardeau gas trapped in harmonic potentials has involved the measurement of momentum distribution profiles @xcite , the ground state energy @xcite and collective oscillations @xcite . to model the experiments",
    "more closely it is desirable to take into account the ` soft ' boundaries of the harmonic potential rather than the commonly used ` hard ' boundaries of a box . unfortunately the axial trapping potential breaks the homogeneity of the integrable model .",
    "however , if the density varies smoothly in a small interval the systems under consideration can be thought of as a uniform bose gas in each small interval @xcite .",
    "this quasiclassical approach is called the _ local density approximation _ and is used to study the density distribution profile in cases where the chemical potential is much larger than the level spacing @xmath138 in the @xmath1d direction . for the equilibrium state the chemical potential of the system in a harmonic trap can be taken to be constant .    applying the local density approximation to the @xmath1d bose gas with periodic boundary conditions at zero temperature , we have @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the local chemical potential of the uniform system and @xmath141 is the local trapping potential .",
