    "the weak decay of heavy hadrons has brought a wealth of information concerning the interaction of mesons , has reported on many mesonic , as well as baryonic , resonances and , together with devoted theoretical work ( see the recent review @xcite ) , has brought new insight into the nature of many resonances which have been the subject of continuous debate @xcite .",
    "the meson scalar sector has been emblematic and the chiral unitary approach , unitarizing in coupled channels the information contained in the chiral lagrangians @xcite , has shown that the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 resonances appear as a consequence of the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons and respond to a kind of molecular structure of these components@xcite , diverting from the standard @xmath6 nature of most mesons .",
    "the case of the @xmath7 ( @xmath3 ) has been thoroughly discussed in a recent review @xcite and the situation has been much clarified . in this picture , the @xmath4 stands as a bound @xmath8 state , with a small component of @xmath9 that provides the decay channel of this state .",
    "much before the advent of the chiral unitary approach , the @xmath8 molecular nature of the @xmath4 had already been claimed @xcite .",
    "a perspective into these `` extraordinary states '' was also recently given in the hadron2015 conference by jaffe @xcite .",
    "the chiral lagrangians can be obtained from a more general framework , which includes vector mesons , the local hidden gauge approach @xcite . in this picture",
    "the chiral lagrangians are obtained by exchanging vector mesons between the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "this picture is most welcome because it allows us to extend the dynamics of the chiral lagrangians to the heavy quark sector , and the interaction of @xmath10 , for instance , would be given by the exchange of light vector mesons .",
    "heavy vector mesons could also be exchanged , but their large mass makes the contributions of these terms subdominant , and the dominant terms , where the heavy quarks act as spectators @xcite , automatically satisfy the rules of heavy quark spin symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is then not surprising that , in analogy to the @xmath8 interaction , which generates the @xmath4 , the @xmath10 interaction also gives rise to a bound state , which was studied in @xcite .",
    "this state was also predicted in @xcite using effective field theory that implements heavy quark spin symmetry . in @xcite",
    "the results of the @xmath11 reaction close to threshold @xcite were analyzed .",
    "a bump around the @xmath10 threshold was observed and the fit to the data was compatible with a state below threshold at 3720 mev ( we shall call this state x(3720 ) from now on ) .",
    "on the other hand , the study of @xmath12 and @xmath13 weak decays looking at resonances in the final state , or threshold behavior of invariant mass distributions , has shown that these reactions have a potential to tell us about the existence of `` hidden '' resonances and their nature . in this sense , in @xcite",
    "a natural explanation was given , in terms of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 as dynamically generated resonances @xcite , for the experimental facts that in the @xmath14 reaction the @xmath4 was clearly observed and no trace of the @xmath3 was seen @xcite , while in the case of the @xmath0 decay , the @xmath3 was seen and only a minor fraction of the @xmath4 was observed @xcite .",
    "these results were complemented by the study of the @xmath13 weak decays , were the production of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 were studied @xcite .    the idea in this paper will be to make predictions for the @xmath10 invariant mass distribution in the decay of @xmath0 . in this sense",
    "the work of @xcite , where the @xmath15 was studied , showed that from the spectrum of the @xmath16 invariant mass one could determine the existence of the @xmath17 below threshold , and the amount of the @xmath16 component in its wave function , using the compositeness sum rule of @xcite .",
    "a similar work was also done in @xcite where the reactions @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 were studied .",
    "it was found there that from the study of @xmath21 and @xmath22 mass distributions close to threshold , the existence of resonances below threshold could be induced .    in the present paper",
    "we will study the @xmath0 decay to @xmath1 with a model based on the work of @xcite that generates the x(3720 ) resonance , and will make predictions for the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution .",
    "the theory predicts the shape of the distribution close to threshold , but not the absolute normalization .",
    "however , from the shape of the distribution the existence of the resonance below threshold could be induced .",
    "additionally , we shall also evaluate the rate of production of the x(3720 ) resonance , irrelevant of its decay channel , and will show that the ratio of this rate to the @xmath2 mass distribution is then predicted with no free parameters , under the assumption that the x(3720 ) resonance is dynamically generated . the implementation of the experiment would provide a boost in the search of this elusive state , which we think really exists .",
    "this experiment and related ones are currently under investigation by the lhcb collaboration @xcite and this gives us a motivation to perform the calculations at the present time .",
    "so far , the related experiment @xmath23 has already been done @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 invariant mass is measured , but with very small statistics close to threshold .",
    "a sharp peak is identified , that corresponds to the excitation of the @xmath24 charmonium state , which decays in p - wave in @xmath2 .",
    "the x(3720 ) state is a scalar meson and it decays into @xmath2 in s - wave . in this sense , testing the invariant mass predicted here should require to separate the s - wave from the p - wave part of the spectrum , something which is already currently been done by the partial wave analysis of the lhcb collaboration , where the contribution of the @xmath25 and @xmath3 are separated in the @xmath0 decay to @xmath26 @xcite . in any case , in the work of @xcite the contribution of the @xmath24 is separated and this allows us to make a comparison of our results with this distribution . with present errors we find a good agreement with the data , thus getting extra support for the x(3720 ) state .",
    "however , our study indicates that the @xmath27 reactions is better suited than the @xmath28 one to give information on that state .",
    "if we followed the steps of [ 26,38 ] , a possible way for the @xmath27 to proceed would be the following : in the first place we would produce a @xmath29 together with a @xmath30 pair as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "decays into @xmath29 and a @xmath30 pair . ]",
    "the next step would consist in introducing a new @xmath31 state with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , @xmath32 in between the created @xmath29 pair , and see which combinations of mesons appear .",
    "this is depicted in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "this would lead to some @xmath33 components .",

    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "pair into two mesons . ]",
    "this way chosen to hadronize the quarks follows the path of @xcite , based on the topology of the internal emission @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case , we also have external emisson , which is color favored and , thus , we adhere to this other mechanism , which is depicted in fig . [ fig3 ] at the quark level .",
    "the hadronization is now done including a @xmath36 scalar pair inside the @xmath37 pair , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and technically this is done as follow : an easy way to see which mesons are produced in the hadronization of @xmath37 is to introduce the @xmath31 matrix @xmath38    in order to get the pair of mesons it is convenient to write the @xmath31 in terms of pseudoscalar mesons and then the @xmath39 matrix has its equivalent matrix in @xmath40 given by    @xmath41    which incorporates the standard @xmath42 mixing @xcite .",
    "now we see that ( see refs.@xcite ) @xmath43 thus , in terms of mesons the hadronized @xmath37 pair will be given by @xmath44 we have the meson - meson components of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dai ] ) , together with a @xmath45 of fig .",
    "if we want to have @xmath46 and @xmath47 at the end , we must take the @xmath48 component of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dai ] ) and let the @xmath49 interact to have @xmath50 .",
    "similarly , if we want to produce the scalar resonance x(3720 ) , which has zero charge , it is also the @xmath48 component of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dai ] ) that we must take , and we will let the @xmath49 interact to give the resonance x(3720 ) at the end . hence , diagramatically this latter process is depicted in fig .",

    "we take it as a constant since we are only concerned about a restricted range of invariant masses , and the factor prior to the final state interaction is smooth in that range @xcite ( see section 3.3 of ref .",
