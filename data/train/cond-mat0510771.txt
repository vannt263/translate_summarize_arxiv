    "one direction of current efforts aimed at development of mesoscopic solid - state qubits",
    "is realization of effective schemes of qubit measurements . different versions of the qubits which use quantum dynamics of magnetic flux in superconducting loops @xcite are at the moment among the most advanced solid - state qubits . practically all of them employ the measurement scheme based on the modulation by the measured qubit of the decay rate of the supercurrent of a josephson junction or a squid . this process can be viewed as tunneling of a magnetic flux quantum and has several attractive features as the basis for measurement .",
    "most important one is sufficiently large sensitivity which comes from strong dependence of the tunneling amplitude on parameters of the tunneling potential controlled by the measured system .",
    "there is , however , an important disadvantage of this approach . in simple few - junction structures , the supercurrent decay brings the detector into the finite - voltage state characterized by large energy dissipation , which strongly perturbs both the system and the detector itself , and makes it impossible to repeat the measurements sufficiently quickly .",
    "this strong perturbation also destroys the state of the measured quantum system by changing it in an uncontrolled way . both of these factors prevent realization of non - trivial quantum measurement strategies which are typically based on continuous measurements or a sequence of successive discrete measurements .",
    "the goal of this work is to suggest and analyze a new flux detector which should not have this drawback .",
    "while still based on tunneling of individual magnetic flux quanta , the detector nevertheless avoids the transition into the dissipative state by using ballistic motion of the flux quanta @xcite .",
    "the detector should have the quantum - limited back - action on the measured system and time resolution sufficient for realization of non - trivial quantum measurements of superconducting qubits .",
    "the cost of achieving this is the need for single - flux - quantum ( sfq ) support electronics @xcite required for operation of this detector .",
    "adaptation of the sfq circuits to qubit applications @xcite is an important , and not fully solved , problem of development of scalable superconducting qubits .",
    "the suggested detector is based on the ballistic motion of fluxons in the josephson transmission line ( jtl ) formed by unshunted junctions with critical currents @xmath0 and capacitances @xmath1 coupled by inductances @xmath2 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the detector can be viewed as the flux analog of the quantum point contact ( qpc ) charge detectors ( see @xcite and references therein ) used for measurements of the quantum - dot qubits .",
    "both detectors make use of the ability of the measured system to control the ballistic motion of independent particles ( electrons in the qpc , fluxons in the jtl detector ) through a one - dimensional channel .",
    "the jtl detector should , however , provide more control over the propagation of individual fluxons than is possible with electrons in the qpcs .",
    "this leads to new measurement regimes ( e.g. , time - delay measurement ) impossible with the qpc .",
    "( 3.3,1.6 ) ( .0,-.1)3.3 in    the jtl detector uses the fact that the flux @xmath3 generated by the measured system creates potential @xmath4 for the fluxons moving in the jtl ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the fluxons are injected one by one , with the period @xmath5 , into the jtl by the generator , and are scattered by the potential @xmath4 localized in some region of the jtl .",
    "the injection frequency @xmath6 is sufficiently low so that only one fluxon at a time moves inside the jtl .",
    "the fluxon scattering characteristics : transmission probability or the time delay associated with the motion through the jtl , are registered by the receiver . since these characteristics depend on the potential @xmath4 controlled by the measured system , they contain information about the state of this system .",

    "we are interested in the regime of small inductances , @xmath17 , in which the jtl acts as a uniform ballistic channel for the fluxons .",

    "( condition of validity of this approximation is discussed more quantitatively at the end of this section . ) in this regime , the jtl is equivalent to a distributed josephson junction , and the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) reduces to the standard `` sine - gordon '' hamiltonian , which can be written as follows : @xmath20 +   \\nonumber \\\\ + \\lambda_j^{-2}(1-\\cos",

    "( [ e2 ] ) and below , all distances along the jtl , including @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are dimensionless , and are measured in units of the cell size @xmath27 of the jtl ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "conversion of most equations to absolute units of length can be achieved simply by changing interpretation of all quantities ( e.g. , @xmath28 ) from `` per cell '' to `` per unit length '' .",
    "the commutation relations for the charges and phases give the following equal - time commutation relations for the field @xmath29 in the hamiltonian ( [ e2 ] ) : @xmath30= \\beta^2 \\delta ( x - x ' ) \\ , , \\label{e3}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath31 measures the wave resistance @xmath32 of the jtl in the absence of josephson tunneling relative to the quantum resistance .",

    "the transition at @xmath37 should be qualitatively similar to the analogous resistance - driven transition in small josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "this analogy suggests that the dynamics of the supercurrent flow in the jtl with large wave resistance should be described in terms of tunneling of individual cooper pairs @xcite . while this limit might be reachable in very narrow and thin jtls of sub - micron width @xcite , we assume here more typical situation , when @xmath32 is on the order of 10  100 ohm and @xmath38 . in this case",
    ", the jtl supports a number of quasiclassical excitations including , most importantly for this work , topological solitons that carry precisely one quantum of magnetic flux each .",
    "dynamics of such `` fluxons '' is equivalent to that of stable , in general relativistic , particles @xcite with the terminal velocity @xmath23 and mass @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the plasma frequency .",
    "another type of quasiclassical excitations in the jtl are the small - amplitude plasmon waves with frequency @xmath41 for a wavevector @xmath42 .    in this work",
    ", we are interested in the `` non - relativistic '' regime of fluxon dynamics , when velocity @xmath43 of its motion is small , @xmath44",
    ". equations ( [ e4 ] ) and ( [ e5 ] ) show that in this regime , the fluxon kinetic energy @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , can be made smaller than the lowest plasmon energy @xmath47 , @xmath48 so that for @xmath49 the fluxon can not emit a plasmon even when it is scattered by non - uniformities of the jtl potential @xcite .",
    "intrinsic dissipation associated with emission of plasmons is then suppressed , and the fluxon motion in the jtl should be elastic , provided that other , `` extrinsic '' , sources of dissipation are also sufficiently weak . although the jtl operation as the flux detector should be possible for moderately strong fluxon dissipation , the dissipation would prevent the detector from reaching the quantum - limited regime .",
    "the shape of the scattering potential @xmath4 for fluxons created by the measured system is determined by the convolution of the distribution of the flux @xmath3 with the distribution of current in each fluxon @xcite , and can be written as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the shape of the fluxon that in general can be distorted by the potential @xmath4 itself . if , however , the potential is smaller than @xmath52 , or does not vary appreciably on the scale of the size of the fluxon given by @xmath26 , the changes in the fluxon shape are negligible , and one can use in eq .",

    "it implies that direct injection of the currents @xmath59 in the jtl junctions indeed produces the same distribution of phases and currents as magnetic coupling generating the fluxes @xmath56 . throughout this work",
    "we assume that the measured system does not inject the net current in the jtl , @xmath61 , i.e. , the corresponding flux ( [ e7 ] ) and the potential ( [ e6 ] ) vanish outside the coupling region : @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "( 3.3,1.0 ) ( .6,-.05)2.1 in    although the assumed condition @xmath38 makes quantum fluctuations of the fluxon shape small , the dynamics of the fluxon as a whole can still be completely quantum .",
    "an example of quantum dynamics of fluxons of this type was recently observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "jtl detector uses the quantum fluxon dynamics in the potential described by eqs .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) or ( [ e7 ] ) . as was mentioned above , operation of the detector",
    "requires that the fluxons are injected by the generator into one end of the jtl and observed by the receiver at the other end ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "both of these circuits can be designed following the general principles of the sfq electronics @xcite and will not be discussed explicitly here .",
    "we simply assume that the ends of the jtl are matched appropriately to these circuits so that the fluxons can enter and leave the jtl without reflection and are injected in the jtl in an appropriate quantum state .",
    "this initial state @xmath64 of an injected fluxon is characterized by the average fluxon velocity @xmath43 and the wave - packet @xmath65 defining its position : @xmath66 as we will see from the discussion in the next section , many properties of the jtl detector are independent of the specific shape of the wave - packet @xmath65 , as long as it is well localized both in coordinate space and space of the fluxon momentum @xmath42 .",
    "they depend only on the wave - packet width @xmath67 in coordinate space and the corresponding width @xmath68 in momentum space .",
    "these parameters should satisfy two obvious conditions : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the total length of the jtl , and @xmath71 .",
    "we assume a stronger form of the second condition that follows from the requirement that the broadening of the wave - packet by @xmath72 because of the momentum uncertainty @xmath73 during the typical time @xmath74 of the fluxon propagation through the jtl is negligible in comparison to the initial width : @xmath75 .",
    "the discussion below shows that this requirement is necessary for the quantum - limited operation of the jtl detector in the time - delay mode .",
    "the two conditions mean that the width @xmath67 is limited as follows : @xmath76    in cases when it will be necessary to specify the shape of the wave - packet @xmath65 we will take it to be gaussian : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the initial fluxon position in the jtl .",
    "besides being well localized as necessary both in the momentum and coordinate space , the wave - packet ( [ e9 ] ) can be obtained as a result of the fluxon generation process that can be implemented naturally with the sfq circuits .",
    "this process consists of the two steps : relaxation of the fluxon to the ground state of a weakly damped and nearly quadratic josephson potential with the required width @xmath67 of the wavefunction of the ground state , and then rapid acceleration to velocity @xmath43 after this potential is switched off .    while the assumed condition @xmath38",
    "does not preclude the quantum dynamics of fluxons in the jtl , eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) shows that decreasing @xmath79 increases the fluxon mass .",
    "this makes it more difficult to maintain quantum coherent dynamics of fluxons , which in the case of large mass becomes more susceptible to perturbations .",
    "for instance , to avoid the effects of discreteness on the fluxon dynamics in the case of the discrete jtl structure ( fig .  1 ) , the wavelength of its wavefunction ( [ e8 ] ) should be larger than the size of one cell .",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath80 and means that the fluxon velocity and kinetic energy can not be larger than , respectively @xmath81 and @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 we see that both the fluxon velocity @xmath43 and its kinetic energy @xmath84 decrease with decreasing @xmath85 and any external perturbation ( e.g. , fluctuations of the critical current of the jtl junctions ) affects the fluxon motion more strongly at small @xmath79 . for realistic values of @xmath26 and @xmath79",
    "the limitation on the fluxon energy ( [ e52 ] ) is stronger than ( [ e51 ] ) .",
    "since the fluxon size @xmath26 can not be increased much for obvious reasons of convenience of fluxon manipulation , the energy ( [ e52 ] ) depends only on the junction capacitance @xmath1 , and can be increased only by decreasing the junction size ( see the discussion below ) . in practical terms , the fluxon energy ( [ e52 ] ) should be at least larger than temperature for the fluxons to be generated by an sfq generator .",
    "all this means that the jtl can operate as the quantum detector only with junctions of sub - micron size .",
    "although the estimate ( [ e52 ] ) was made for the discrete jtl , the same practical conclusion would be reached in the case of nominally - uniform long josephson junctions , for which the limitation on the fluxon momentum @xmath86 would be set by unavoidable spatial fluctuations of the junction parameters .",
    "( 3.3,1.35 ) ( .4,-.1)2.1 in    we end this section with a discussion of experimental realization of the jtl detector with conventional thin - film `` tri - layer '' fabrication technology of the sfq circuits . simplified but sufficiently realistic geometry of one jtl cell in this case is shown in fig .",
    "it contains 4 superconductor ( niobium ) films , the lower and the top of which ( ground plane and the counter - electrode ) are used to define inductances , while the two layers in the middle are separated by a very thin layer of insulator ( the tri - layer structure ) and are used to produce the josephson junctions .",
    "such a discrete multi - layer configuration of the jtl is more convenient than a uniform long josephson junction , since it enables one to optimize separately the junctions and inductances of the jtl , most importantly , to reduce effective capacitance .    one possible drawback of the discrete configuration could be the parasitic periodic potential @xmath87 for the fluxons produced by the jtl discreteness ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this potential , however , is negligible when @xmath26 is not too small , @xmath88 . indeed , using the hamilonian ( [ e1 ] ) and equation for the static distribution @xmath8 that follows from it , we can write the energy @xmath89 of the static fluxon as @xmath90 applying the poisson summation formula to this expression , we get in the limit of sufficiently large @xmath26 : @xmath91 \\ , , \\label{e54}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the fluxon rest energy , @xmath93 is the fluxon coordinate in units of the jtl period @xmath27 , and @xmath94 here @xmath95 is a smooth envelope of the discrete distribution @xmath96 ( [ e53 ] ) associated with the static fluxon @xmath8 . since @xmath95 is smooth in the limit of large @xmath26 , eq .",
