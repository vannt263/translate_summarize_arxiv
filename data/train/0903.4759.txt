    "this has sparked interest in the analysis of different spin models on complex networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , such models have interesting applications .",
    "for example , the opinion of each individual of a social network may be represented by an ising spin e.g. for simple yes or no alternatives .",
    "such a model may describe phenomenon of opinion formation , namely , individuals change their mind under the influence of their acquaintances @xcite .",
    "the properties of the order - disorder phase transition of the ising model on complex networks strongly depend on the node degree distribution ( [ eq01 ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite and analytical calculations @xcite of the ising model on barabasi - albert scale - free networks ( @xmath4 ) as well as different analytical approaches @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite for the ising model on networks with arbitrary degree distributions have been performed .",
    "three types of behavior were found depending on the respective behavior of the moments @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the degree distribution , which are related to the value of the @xmath7 exponent .",
    "namely , if @xmath6 and @xmath5 are finite ( @xmath8 ) , the behavior of the system is described by the standard mean - field critical exponents . if @xmath6 diverges and @xmath5 is finite , which corresponds to @xmath9 , the critical behavior is governed by either mean fields exponents with logarithmic corrections ( @xmath10 ) or by nontrivial @xmath7-dependent critical exponents . finally , if both @xmath6 and @xmath5 diverge ( @xmath11 ) , the critical temperature becomes divergent ( for the infinite - size networks ) and the system is always ordered .",
    "furthermore , other models on scale free networks , namely the xy @xcite and potts @xcite models ( for a more detailed list see e.g. @xcite ) also show peculiarities depending on the value of @xmath7 .",
    "rather recently , critical phenomena on complex networks have been studied in the spirit of landau theory @xcite .",
    "the power of the latter is that it is independent of the origin of the interactions between the particles , and therefore it may be applied to a wide range of systems .",
    "the main new feature of the phenomenological theory of critical phenomena on complex networks , that differs from the standard landau theory is the dependence of the coefficients on the moments @xmath12 of the degree distribution ( [ eq01 ] ) .",
    "landau theory for two interacting scalar order parameters is widely used to analyze systems with several possible types of ordering ( e.g. ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic , ferroelectric and ferromagnetic , or structural and magnetic ordering )",

    "the latter is obtained from the @xmath1 invariant free energy by adding invariants of the symmetry group @xmath26 of the @xmath24-dimensional hypercube @xcite .",
    "the aim of our work is to generalize the landau theory for models on complex networks @xcite to the case of two interacting order parameters with a free energy symmetry given by ( [ eq02 ] ) .",

    "this section is devoted to the construction of a generalized landau theory for a system with two coupled order parameters on a network ( [ iia ] ) . besides , we derive a corresponding free energy starting with a microscopic spin hamiltonian and compare both approaches ( [ iib ] ) .",
    "in the spirit of the landau approach we assume that the system may display some ordering which can be quantitatively characterized by two order parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for convenience",
    "let us introduce a vector @xmath17 . following the work of ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that the landau free energy is not only a function of the order parameters , conjugated field @xmath27 , and temperature but also depends on the node degree distribution @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the contribution to the free energy of an individual node of degree @xmath2 , and @xmath31 is the maximal node degree of the network .",

    "( [ eq01 ] ) one finds in general that all moments @xmath12 with @xmath54 are finite , whereas all moments with @xmath55 diverge .",

    "if @xmath6 or lower moments of the degree distribution are divergent ( @xmath56 ) , as often found for real networks , the free energy ( [ eq04 ] ) at the first sight may seem to be infinite for any nonzero values of the order parameters , a behavior which certainly is unphysical .",
    "in fact , the correct way to calculate the free energy is to take into account all the orders of the series ( [ eq06 ] ) .",
    "this procedure ensures to a behavior of the function @xmath30 at large values of @xmath57 as described by equation ( [ eq07 ] ) .",

    "as we will see , differences between usual landau theory and that on a scale - free network become apparent starting from the marginal case @xmath10 .",
    "( _ a _ ) _ case @xmath8 _    in this case the free energy may be found easily by substituting ( [ eq06 ] ) into ( [ eq04 ] ) and performing the integration .",

    "note , that for @xmath11 , the term of order @xmath49 is no more the leading one .",
    "terms of lower order of magnitude become relevant .",
    "in particular there is a term @xmath105 for @xmath4 , and a term @xmath106 for @xmath90 .    before passing to the details of the phase diagram that results from the expressions for the landau free energy ( [ feg5 ] ) , ( [ fe5 ] ) , ( [ fe35 ] ) , ( [ fe3 ] ) , ( [ fe23 ] ) ,",
    "we first proceed to show that the landau free energy may also be derived from a spin system on a network by calculating its partition function in the simplest of approximations .",
    "one of the ways to get the landau free energy with two coupled scalar order parameters is to start from two coupled spin subsystems @xcite .",
