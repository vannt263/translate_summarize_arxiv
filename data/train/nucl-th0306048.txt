    "the slow neutron capture , or @xmath7 process is thought to be the production mechanism for approximately half of all heavy elements in the universe @xcite . the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of low and intermediate mass stars is thought to be the most likely astrophysical site for this process @xcite .",
    "although the neutron source for the @xmath7 process has still not been well identified , the most recent studies seem to prefer the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath5)@xmath6o reaction as the main neutron source in agb stars at low temperatures @xcite .    models of the @xmath7 process depend critically on the neutron flux produced by the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath5)@xmath6o reaction .",
    "however , the astrophysical @xmath14 factor for this reaction , defined by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cross section and @xmath17 the coulomb parameter , has been determined experimentally down to a centre of mass energy of only 270 kev @xcite , whereas the reaction takes place predominantly at energies below this point .",
    "as the cross section for the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath5)@xmath6o reaction decreases extremely rapidly as the incident @xmath0 energy gets lower , direct measurement of the reaction rate at lower energies is very difficult .",
    "extrapolations @xcite suggest a rapid increase of the @xmath14 factor as the incident @xmath0 energy reduces to zero , which has been ascribed to the effect of resonances in @xmath3o @xcite , the @xmath18 = @xmath19 level at 5.94 mev and the @xmath2 level at 6.356 mev , both very close to the @xmath0 + @xmath4c threshold of 6.359 mev",
    ". however , due to the experimental uncertainties , the data are also consistent with a constant , horizontal extrapolated @xmath14 factor @xcite .    in a recent paper , kubono _",
    "_ @xcite suggested that a better way to determine the @xmath14 factor at lower energies is via a direct @xmath0 transfer measurement .",
    "the reaction chosen for this study was the @xmath4c(@xmath8li,@xmath9)@xmath3o transfer at @xmath10 mev and angular distributions for transfers leading to the 0.0 mev @xmath20 , 0.87 mev @xmath2 , 3.055 mev @xmath19 , 3.84 mev @xmath21 , 4.55 mev @xmath22 and 6.356 mev @xmath2 states of @xmath3o were accurately measured .",
    "the @xmath0 spectroscopic factor @xmath1 of each state was determined from a finite - range distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) analysis @xcite of these data . using the value of @xmath1 obtained for the 6.356 mev @xmath2 state , its @xmath0 width was determined and the cross section of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath5)@xmath6o reaction through the tail of this sub - threshold resonance calculated .",
    "the astrophysical @xmath14 factor was then calculated using eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .    the dwba analysis of kubono _ et al .",
    "_ gave a very small value of @xmath11 for the 6.356 mev @xmath2 state of @xmath3o when normalised by the same scaling factor used to obtain @xmath23 for the 3.055 mev @xmath19 state .",
    "this leads to a very small contribution of the @xmath24 sub - threshold state to the reaction rate at low energies and thus to an astrophysical @xmath14 factor that is essentially constant below @xmath25 kev .",
    "since such a result poses serious questions about the mechanism of neutron production for the @xmath7 process , a reanalysis of the kubono _",
    "data was undertaken . in the present work we present the results of detailed dwba and coupled reaction channels ( crc ) analyses of these same data to determine whether @xmath1 for the 6.356 mev @xmath2 state of @xmath3o is actually so small .",
    "our results show that the original dwba analysis of kubono _ et al . _ led to incorrect conclusions , and that their data are compatible with a much larger value of @xmath1 for the 6.356 mev @xmath2 state .",
    "the present analysis is consistent with previous extrapolations of the astrophysical @xmath14 factor for the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath5)@xmath6o reaction that indicate a rapid increase as the incident @xmath0 energy approaches zero .",
    "initially , we carried out a dwba analysis as similar as possible to that of kubono _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , but using the code fresco @xcite .",
    "we employed the same @xmath0 + @xmath4c binding potential and the same @xmath8li + @xmath4c and @xmath9 + @xmath3o optical potentials as in the original analysis @xcite .",
    "however , all calculations presented here were carried out including the full complex remnant term unless otherwise stated .",
    "the remnant term occurs in the residual interaction @xmath26 in the expression for the transition amplitude in the dwba . for the reaction @xmath27 the residual interaction",
    "is defined as follows for post form dwba : @xmath28 and in the prior form : @xmath29 the remnant terms are the quantities in parentheses , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the ( complex ) optical model potentials in the entrance and exit channels , respectively and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the potentials binding the transferred particle ( @xmath34 ) to the projectile and target cores , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is a ( complex ) optical potential operating between the projectile and target cores .",
    "see satchler @xcite for a full discussion of these terms .",
    "the use of the full remnant term enables good agreement between post and prior formulations of the dwba to be obtained , which is not possible when no remnant term is included .",
    "we show results for the post formulation , although we did perform test calculations using the prior form to ensure that agreement was obtained . as a further check we compared calculations performed using fresco with no remnant term ( using the post formulation ) with calculations carried out with the code dwuck5 @xcite . for each transfer considered here excellent agreement between the two codes",

    "we adopt the convention that the number of radial nodes includes that at the origin but excludes that at infinity .",
    "the @xmath0 + @xmath4c binding potential had a radius of @xmath37 fm and diffuseness 0.65 fm , the depth being adjusted to give the correct binding energy for each @xmath3o state considered .",
    "the number of nodes @xmath38 and orbital angular momentum of the transferred @xmath0 particle with respect to the @xmath4c core @xmath39 were fixed by the oscillatory energy conservation relation @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the corresponding single - nucleon shell quantum numbers .",

    "this agreement with the calculation of furutani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows that the @xmath49 values that we have extracted from our dwba calculations are at least plausible .",
    "furthermore , it supports the suggestion of bethge _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that these states ( the 3.055 mev @xmath19 , 3.84 mev @xmath21 and 4.55 mev @xmath22 ) are of predominantly 4p-3h character .",
    "a recent dwba analysis of new 60 mev @xmath4c(@xmath8li,@xmath9)@xmath3o transfer data @xcite found a very small @xmath0-spectroscopic factor ( @xmath11 ) for the 6.356 mev @xmath2 state .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that there is no large enhancement of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath5)@xmath6o reaction rate at energies of astrophysical interest due to this sub - threshold state based on the small reduced @xmath0 width they obtained , contrary to previous suggestions @xcite .",
    "since such a result poses serious questions about the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath5)@xmath6o reaction as a neutron source for the @xmath7 process , we have performed dwba and crc analyses of their data using a realistic choice for the entrance channel optical potential .",
    "we concluded that the transfer data are consistent with a much larger @xmath1 value for the 6.356 mev @xmath2 state and consequently a much larger @xmath13 value .",
    "thus , the transfer data are compatible with a large contribution from this state to the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath5)@xmath6o reaction rate at very low energies .",
    "we have also shown that uncertainties in the assumed @xmath50c structure of the @xmath3o states can have significant effects on the extracted spectroscopic factors and reduced @xmath0 widths . while this problem does not directly affect the 6.356 mev @xmath2 state",
    ", one needs to be aware of it . as _ relative _",
    "@xmath1 factors are reasonably well determined one may use the normalisation procedure employed by kubono _",
    "_ to scale the dwba results to a calculated value for a state that is believed to have significant @xmath0 clustering structure in order to obtain absolute @xmath1 values",
    ". however , such a method is highly questionable as the fragmentation of the @xmath0-cluster states over the low - energy region of @xmath3o excitations is unknown .",
    "moreover , there are difficulties in this method as it relies on the accuracy of the structure calculation used for the normalisation , plus it is not clear what effect this process should have on the @xmath0 + core wave function if one wishes to extract @xmath13 values .",
    "we also noted the effect of the entrance channel optical potential on the @xmath1 values extracted from the dwba analysis , which was considerable . this demonstrates the need to have a realistic choice for the optical potential in the entrance channel .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to obtain elastic scattering data over a large angular range ( possibly much larger than the angular range of the transfer data themselves ) if one wishes to use this type of indirect approach to obtain reliable estimates of astrophysical reaction rates .",
    "a limited coupled reaction channels study found that couplings between the ground and excited states of @xmath3o had a negligible effect on the @xmath1 values .",
    "other multi - step transfer paths , in particular , those proceeding via the excited states of @xmath4c , were not investigated due to the need for some prior estimate of the necessary @xmath0 strengths . without such estimates",
    "one merely introduces extra adjustable parameters that need to be determined from the same data set .",
    "in summary , we have highlighted some of the pitfalls of dwba analyses of @xmath0 transfer reactions and their use to extract spectroscopic factors .",
    "we have not considered in detail the more fundamental question of whether such transfer reactions may be adequately described by a simple direct @xmath0 transfer , as is assumed in the dwba . if multi - step paths contribute significantly to the @xmath0 transfer strength the @xmath1 values extracted from such a dwba analysis will not be reliable , regardless of how carefully it is carried out .",
    "however , an extensive investigation of these multi - step transfer paths still can not be carried out in a meaningful way for the @xmath4c(@xmath8li,@xmath9)@xmath3o reaction due to the lack of prior estimates of the required @xmath0 strengths for transfers proceeding via the excited states of @xmath4c .",
    "thus , while the indirect approach to astrophysical reaction rates can be a valuable tool one needs to be aware of possible uncontrolled parameters contained in the analysis .",
