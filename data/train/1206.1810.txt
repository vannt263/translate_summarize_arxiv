    "quasistatic carnot cycle is the most efficient heat engine cycle allowed by physical laws .",
    "practically any heat engine operates far from the ideal maximum efficiency conditions set by carnot @xcite .",
    "although the carnot cycle has the highest efficiency , its power output is zero because the time for completing a cycle is infinite .",
    "the cycle should be speeded up to obtain a finite power . considering a finite - time carnot cycle within the assumption of endoreversibility that irreversible processes occur only through the heat exchanges , curzon and ahlborn ( ca )",
    "@xcite obtained the efficiency at maximum power output as @xmath8 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs , respectively . historically speaking , the seminal expression ( [ etth ] )",
    "was derived by yvon @xcite and novikov @xcite much earlier than @xcite .",
    "but it is usually called the ca efficiency . recently , the issue of the efficiency at maximum power output , as main focus of finite time thermodynamics , has attracted much interest @xcite . under the low - dissipation assumption that the irreversible entropy production in a heat - exchange process is inversely proportional to the time required for completing that process , esposito _",
    "et al_. @xcite proposed a model for low - dissipation carnot - like engines , in which use of endoreversibility hypothesis and phenomenological transfer laws can be avoided .",
    "although the importance of internally frictional dissipation in an adiabatic process was mentioned by novikov in his pioneer paper @xcite , most of the studies about the efficiency at maximum power output always neglect the influence of inner friction on the performance of the heat engine models , within the assumption that the time taken for completing the adiabatic process is ignored or proportional to the total time spent on the isothermal processes . from everyday experience ,",
    "the irreversible phenomena that limits the optimal performance of engines occurs not only in an isothermal process but but also in an adiabatic process because of inner friction when classical or quantum piston moves @xcite .",
    "dissipation loss due to internally dissipative friction , by which real engines are dominated @xcite , has been discussed in several papers @xcite .",
    "however , so far there has been no comprehensive discussion of the effects of friction on the cycle performance in the literature , and thus the properties of an irreversible carnot - like cycle consisting of two irreversible isothermal and two non - isentropic adiabatic processes have not been addressed adequately and clearly .",
    "for this reason , we follow the tradition of thermodynamics constructing a more generalized engine , in which the  adiabatic \" process takes finite time as well as becoming non - isentropic @xcite .",
    "troughout this paper , the word  isothermal \" merely indicates that the working substance is in contact with a reservoir at constant temperature , and the word  adiabatic \" means that the working substance is isolated from a heat reservoir and no heat exchange happens .    in this paper , we focus on the study of the efficiency at maximum power output of an irreversible carnot - like engine performing finite time cycles ,",
    "in which frictional dissipation and the time of any adiabat are taken into account .",
    "we derive the cycle period which contains time spent on four thermodynamic processes , which is quite different from that derived in the previous models for which the time of two adiabatic processes was assumed to either be proportional to the time duration of the two isothermal processes or be negligible . in the frictionless case ,",
    "the efficiencies at maximum power output are proved to bounded between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with the carnot efficiency @xmath5 , coinciding with the result found in ref .",
    "@xcite for frictionless engine models in which the time required for completing any adiabatic process was assumed to be totally ignored . in the strong limits of the dissipations in the hot and cold isothermal processes , we find that the efficiency at maximum power output approaches the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "if dissipations of two isothermal and two adiabatic processes are symmetric , respectively , we prove that the efficiency at maximum power output is bounded between @xmath6 and the curzon - ahlborn ( ca ) efficiency @xmath7 , and that the ca efficiency is reached by ignoring the friction .",
    "a carnot - like cycle @xmath9 is drawn in the @xmath10 plane ( see fig . [ st ] ) . during two isothermal processes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the working substance is coupled to a hot and a cold heat reservoir at constant temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath13 be the entropies at the instants @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "for the reversible cycle where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we recover the carnot efficiency @xmath18 , which is independent of the properties of the working substance . in the adiabatic process @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , the working substance is decoupled from the hot ( cold ) reservoir , and the entropy changes from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 to @xmath24 ) in a period @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "let us consider the carnot - like cycle under finite - time operation .",
    "finite - time cycles move the working substance away from the equilibrium , leading to irreversibility of the engine .",
    "although the system needs no close to equilibrium during the isothermal process , the system remains in an equilibrium state with the heat reservoir at the special instants @xmath14 where @xmath27 .",
    "under such a circumstance , the thermodynamic quantities of the system@xmath28 in particular the entropy@xmath28are well defined at these instants . unlike in the frictionless case where any adiabatic process is isentropic , the adiabatic process becomes non - isentropic when friction is included , since friction develops heat and leads to an increase in entropy in any adiabat .",
    "this additional heat remains in chamber or in trap along an adiabatic process until it is released to a heat reservoir with which the working systems couples during an isothermal process . as a consequence ,",
    "heat productions due to friction in the adiabatic expansion @xmath19 and in the adiabatic compression @xmath20 are released into the cold and hot reservoirs , respectively @xcite .",
    "this additional heat is also represented in fig .",
    "[ st ] by the red triangular area for the branch @xmath29 and by the blue triangular area for the process @xmath20 .",
