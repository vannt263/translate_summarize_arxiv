    "a proper understanding of the confinement phenomenon in quantum chromodynamincs ( qcd ) , describing the transition from the perturbatively calculable parton level to the experimentally observable hadron level , is still missing . in order to get",
    "a better understanding of the hadronisation process one is therefore lead to constructing models , such as the lund string fragmentation model  @xcite , and then compare these to data .",
    "of special interest in these types of models is the treatment of the colour quantum number and the associated colour flux .",
    "typically , the planar approximation is used for this , which is valid in the large @xmath6 limit , leading to a good description of inclusive event properties at high energy colliders .    at the same time",
    ", there is also a large class of so called hard diffractive processes in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 collisions which can not be described by the planar approximation .",
    "the signifying feature of this type of processes is that the final state particles are divided into two or more colour singlet systems , separated by large rapidity gaps , and that at least one of these systems has the properties of a hard partonic interaction , such as jets .",
    "these events are in accordance with the predictions of the model introduced @xcite based on pomeron exchange .",
    "although further developments of this model is successful in describing rapidity gap data , it implies different descriptions of diffractive and non - diffractive events without a smooth transition in between .    in order to order to remedy this situation and get a model that can describe both inclusive and hard diffractive processes , the soft colour interaction ( sci ) model",
    "was introduced  @xcite . in short ,",
    "this model is based on the assumption that the colour flux from the hard perturbative interaction is modified through interactions with the colour background field represented by the remnants of the incoming hadrons . in the simplest version of the model",
    "there is only one new additional parameter describing this interaction , namely the probability for such a colour exchange .",
    "these colour rearrangements were added to the lund monte carlo programs lepto  @xcite for deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and pythia  @xcite for hadron - hadron collisions , where they give rise to events having regions in phase space where no string is stretched , and therefore no hadrons are being produced .",
    "these rapidity gap events are classified as diffractive and this simple model essentially reproduces all data on diffractive hard scattering in both @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite collisions .",
    "of course , events without such rapidity gaps are also produced corresponding to ordinary inclusive events .",
    "the sci colour rearrangements can also turn a colour octet @xmath9 or @xmath10 pair into a singlet , leading to production of charmonium and bottomonium states in basic agreement with data from @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological success of the sci model @xcite indicates that it captures some very essential qcd dynamics .",
    "it is therefore interesting that recent developments on qcd rescattering theory @xcite provides a basis for this model @xcite .",
    "rescatterings of a hard - scattered parton on the spectator system can not be gauged away and do contribute at leading twist . in dis such rescatterings of the struck quark via 1,2  gluons are summed in the wilson line used in the definition of the parton density functions , which thereby absorb these rescatterings effects when fitted to inclusive dis data . however , for less inclusive observables that depend on the colour structure in the event , these rescatterings are important and the sci model is a phenomenological model to account for their effect .",
    "there are also several extensions of the model .",
    "the difference in the potential energy of various string configurations can be included  @xcite and the momentum transfer in the colour exchange can be modelled  @xcite .",
    "the model has also been successfully extended to describe jet quenching in a quark gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "the rational behind the sci model is to learn more about the non - perturbative dynamics by starting from a well defined perturbative state .",
    "one such example , which is the subject of this paper , is the production of hidden and open charm in hadronic @xmath0-decays .",
    "thanks to the @xmath0-factories there is now a wealth of detailed data from the babar and belle experiments , which can be used as a testing ground for the ideas behind the sci model . in a @xmath0-meson decay",
    "the hard scale is given by the @xmath13-quark mass , @xmath14 gev , and the decay products then interact with the remaining soft part of the @xmath0-meson . following earlier applications of the sci model , we are aiming at formulating a model which can describe both hidden and open charm production .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section 2 by reviewing earlier models for hidden and open charm production in b - decays , with emphasis on charmonium production , and how they compare with data . in section 3",
    "we then present our model on the parton level and the transition to the observable hadron level .",
    "the resulting model is then compared to existing data in section 4 and finally section 5 contains the conclusions .",
    "charmonium production in @xmath0-decays has a long history . in a naive version of the so called colour singlet model ( csm )",
    "@xcite one notes that there is a probability 1/9 that the @xmath9 pair in a @xmath15 decay is in a colour singlet state and combines this with the @xmath5 wave - function at the origin giving a rate which is in reasonable agreement with data .",
    "however , in a proper treatment one also has to take into account that the hamiltonian describing the @xmath13-decay should be the effective one , where the @xmath16-boson ( and @xmath17-quark ) has been integrated out  @xcite .",
    "this gives an additional factor @xmath18 suppression of the colour singlet state compared to the colour octet one  @xcite . to make things even worse ,",
    "a strict nlo calculation of the colour singlet rate becomes negative  @xcite unless one also includes @xmath19 corrections to the colour octet channel and thus modifies the perturbative expansion .",
    "even so , the rate obtained is about a factor ten below data . in addition",
    "the csm can not be used to calculate the production of p - wave charmonium states ( @xmath20 ) .    a theoretically more sound description of charmonium production in @xmath0-decays is provided by the so called colour octet model ( com ) , based on non - relativistic qcd  @xcite , in which the decay is factorised into two parts .",
    "first , a non - relativistic colour singlet or octet @xmath9-pair is produced in a given spectroscopic state , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the spin , orbital angular momentum and total angular momentum respectively , and then this state is transformed into a charmonium hadron through the possible emission of soft gluons in order to get a colour singlet system .",
    "the latter process is described by non - perturbative matrix - elements which in principle can be fitted from data .",
    "if one only takes into account the colour singlet and octet @xmath25 states and uses data from the @xmath5 decay width and the production of @xmath5 at large transverse momenta at the tevatron to fit the non - perturbative matrix elements , then the com predicts a rate for direct @xmath5 production which is about half of the observed value  @xcite and similarly for @xmath26 .",
    "however , in a proper non - relativistic expansion the colour octet @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 states also need to be included  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding non - perturbative matrix - elements can not be fitted independently so it is not possible to get a prediction for these rates .",
    "once the @xmath5 rate has been fitted it can be used  @xcite to get a prediction for the inclusive @xmath30 rate , for which there is yet no data .",
    "finally one can fit the branching ratio @xmath31 and get a prediction for @xmath32 which turns out to be about a factor two below the observation .",
    "given that the @xmath5 rate is fitted to data , the com can then be used to calculate the @xmath5 momentum distribution by assuming that the @xmath13-quark decays through a two body process @xmath33 , taking into account smearing from the boost to the @xmath0 ( or @xmath34 ) rest system  @xcite as well as a non - perturbative  shape - function \" which resums the emissions of multiple soft gluons  @xcite .",
    "overall this gives a good description of the data on direct @xmath5 production when combined with a model for the @xmath35 contributions except for small momenta where it is much below the data  @xcite .",
    "several suggestions have been made for how to describe this low - momentum region , including enhanced baryon pair production  @xcite , hybrid mesons  @xcite , and hidden charm diquark - antidiquark bound states  @xcite .",
    "as already alluded to our model aims to describe both open and hidden charm production .",
    "whereas the production of charmonium states in @xmath0-decays have been studied extensively , there has been less attention devoted to @xmath36 and @xmath37 decays .",
    "there are some models , which all are more or less based on the factorization hypothesis and to varying degree make use of heavy quark symmetry .",
    "for example , for @xmath36 decays we have the simpler pole models  @xcite which later have been refined  @xcite using heavy quark symmetry .",
    "another example is given by  @xcite , which is an extension of the so called isgur - scora - grinstein - wise model  @xcite to non - leptonic decays , also assuming factorisation .",
    "typically all of these models are able to describe the branching ratios of the specific decay processes they are studying ( see for example  @xcite ) but they can not be used to predict hidden charm production . finally , there also exists models for @xmath37 decays assuming that they proceed via an intermediate @xmath38 state  @xcite , which however are not so successful at describing data .",
    "the model has three main ingredients : the internal @xmath0-meson dynamics with the @xmath13-quark decay giving a partonic final state , the soft colour interactions which modifies the colour structure of the event and finally hadronisation using the lund string model amended with special treatment of systems of small invariant mass and the mapping onto discrete charmonium states .",
    "it is particularly important to have a properly devised and tuned hadronisation model in order to describe the exclusive few - body final states in @xmath0-meson decays that is investigated here . in this section",
    "we define and discuss these details of our model .",
    "the @xmath0-meson can be viewed as a non - relativistic @xmath13-quark surrounded by a non - perturbative hadronic system represented by a spectator quark to account for the light valence quark as well as seaquarks and gluon contributions .",
    "this is the basis for the accmm model  @xcite , which describes the internal dynamics of the @xmath0-meson . in the @xmath0-meson rest system",
    "the three - momentum @xmath39 of the @xmath13-quark is spherically symmetric and given by the normalised gaussian @xmath40 having a width given by the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the other model parameter is the mass @xmath42 of the spectator .",
    "the decaying @xmath13-quark is not a final state parton and its mass @xmath43 is allowed to vary dynamically as given by energy - momentum conservation , @xmath44 , resulting in @xmath45    the weak decay of the @xmath13-quark is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ feynbdec ] , which defines the four - momenta in the process , where in the @xmath13 rest frame @xmath46 .",
    "the differential decay rate in the @xmath13 rest frame is then    @xmath47    where @xmath48 are @xmath49-factors for the hadronic and semi - leptonic decays , respectively , that will be fitted to data to get the correct normalization .",
    "the leading order spin averaged squared matrix element for the @xmath13-quark decay can be expressed as @xcite @xmath50    -quark decay into a lighter quark , @xmath51 , and a fermion pair , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is the momentum of the incoming @xmath13-quark , @xmath55 is the momentum transferred by the @xmath16 and @xmath56 the momenta of final state particles . ]    in our monte carlo model we thus start by generating the three - momentum @xmath39 of the @xmath13-quark from eq .",
    "( [ eq : b - mom ] ) , which is then used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b - mass ] ) to get the dynamical @xmath13-quark mass @xmath43 .",
    "the momenta of the decay products from the @xmath13-quark decay are then generated according to the differential decay rate in eqs .",
    "( [ eqndiffdec],[eqnmatel ] ) in the @xmath13-quark rest frame and boosted to the @xmath0-meson rest frame .      from the calculation of the two colour configurations in the @xmath15 decay using the effective theory  @xcite , we know that the @xmath9 colour singlet fraction is suppressed with about a factor 100 compared to the colour octet one",

    "[ plotbrexc ] demonstrates that also the exclusive branching ratios are quite well described by the model and that the difference between the two fits is again very small . in both cases",
    "the model essentially describes all the different channels involving @xmath68-mesons , including the relative strength of @xmath68 and @xmath69 channels .",
    "it also gives an overall good description of the states that can be produced from the two colour configurations displayed in fig .",
    "[ feynncrc ] and discussed in section  [ sec : colstr ] respectively .",
    "this is true both for the two - body decays shown in fig .",
    "[ plotbrexc](c , d ) as well as for the three - body decays shown in fig .",
    "[ plotbrexc](a , b ) where for some channels both colour configuration @xmath57 and @xmath66 contribute as indicated in the figure . as a consequence",
    "the model also gives sum - rules of the type , @xmath70 , which , at least within errors , are in agreement with data .",
    "evidently it is more demanding to describe all these exclusive final states which are sensitive to the non - perturbative dynamics in hadronic few - body systems with relatively small kinetic energy available . in view of this , it is remarkable that this model with only a few parameters reproduce the data so well .",
    "we also note that the rate for @xmath71 , which is controlled by the @xmath72 parameter , comes out essentially right even if this decay mode is not included in the fit .",
    "not surprisingly , however , there are some channels where the description is not so good .",
    "this is mainly for channels with one of the heavier charmonium states and either a @xmath49 or a @xmath73 , e.g. @xmath74 . in our approach",
    "the two mesons are formed more or less independently and we therefore get about the same ratio for @xmath75 and @xmath76 irrespectively of whether it is produced together with a heavier or lighter charmonium state .",
    "however , the data indicates that the production of mesons with small relative momenta , _",
    "i.e. _ closer to threshold , such as @xmath77 , should be suppressed .    when fitting to all channels we get @xmath78 , which may be considered too large for a good fit .",
    "most of the @xmath79 is , however , coming from some particular channels .",
    "for example , removing the @xmath80 channels , which gives the dominant contribution , results in @xmath81 .",
    "we also note that since our model is not based on first principles , it is not very meaningful to perform @xmath79-tests of it .",
    "instead , it is meant to investigate whether the sci model , which is phenomenologically very successful in describing other kinds of data related to colour string - field topologies , is of relevance also in decays of @xmath0-mesons , and this seems indeed to be the case .          finally , in fig .",
    "[ momdist ] the results of our model is compared to the momentum distribution of directly produced @xmath5 s in @xmath0 decays measured in the @xmath82(4s ) rest frame .",
    "first of all it is clear from the figure that our model gives a good overall description of the data especially in the low - momentum region , whereas it is slightly too high in the peak region . at the same time",
    "it should be noted that the model has not been fitted to the normalisation of these data , only to the inclusive and inclusive plus exclusive branching ratios respectively . since the peak in fig .",
    "[ momdist ] is dominated by two - body decays , the model s excess here of @xmath83 indicates that it produces somewhat too many direct @xmath5 s , in particular in the @xmath84 channel as is also indicated by figure fig .",
    "[ plotbrexc](c ) .    for comparison fig .",
    "[ momdist ] also shows the results of a nrqcd based model from  @xcite discussed in section 2 .",
    "this model is a combination of the com results  @xcite together with a model for the exclusive @xmath84 and @xmath85 decays .",
    "in contrast to our model , the nrqcd based model is not at all able to describe the low - momentum region , which has given rise to various alternative explanations as already mentioned .",
    "it is also important to recognize that the parameter that mostly affects the overall shape of the momentum distribution , namely the width , @xmath41 , of the gaussian momentum distribution of the @xmath13-quark in the @xmath0-meson , does not affect the low - momentum region of the spectrum .",
    "instead this parameter is responsible for the smearing in the peak region .",
    "similarly , the mass @xmath42 of the spectator quark also does not affect the low - momentum region .",
    "in addition , for both of these parameters we have used the same values as in  @xcite .",
    "the main difference of our model compared to the nrqcd - based ones therefore lies in the dynamical treatment of the decay products from the @xmath13-quark .",
    "such soft dynamics is particularly important to get a good description of the low - momentum region in fig .",
    "[ momdist ] , and our detailed model does indeed provide an improvement .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new model , which can describe both open and hidden charm production in @xmath0-meson decays .",
    "the model is based on the accmm model for the internal @xmath0-meson dynamics , the sci model for colour rearrangements in the partonic final state , a model for mapping of colour singlet @xmath86 pair on to charmonium states and a new procedure for hadronising colour singlet systems with small invariant mass within the lund string fragmentation framework .    using more or less standard values for the parameters of the accmm and sci models : the width of the gaussian momentum distribution of the @xmath13-quark in the @xmath0-meson , @xmath87 gev , the mass of the spectator quark , @xmath88 gev , and , the probability for a colour rearrangement , @xmath89 , we find overall good agreement with the data both on open and hidden charm production . in order for this to be possible",
    "we have had to activate the production of axial vector mesons in the hadronisation with a probability @xmath90 consistent with the number of available angular momentum states .",
    "we have also improved the probing of the available phase space , which is particularly constrained for processes close to mass thresholds , by increasing the number of times that the program tries to make a single hadron out of a given small mass partonic system . related to this",
    ", we have modified the way that energy and momentum is exchanged when the invariant mass of such a parton system has to be changed in order to give the proper hadron mass .",
    "our model gives a very good description of inclusive observables such as @xmath64 and @xmath91 , which shows that the basic ideas ingredients of the model are correct .",
    "in particular it shows that the idea of soft colour interactions also can be successfully applied in @xmath0-meson decays giving a unified description both of open and hidden charm production .",
    "when it comes to exclusive decay modes the overall description is still good but there are some channels , which are not well described .",
    "the latter is especially true for @xmath92 and @xmath93 indicating that there is something lacking in the model for mapping colour singlet @xmath86 pair onto charmonium states which also may be connected to the fact that these decay modes are the ones closest to threshold that we have considered .",
    "last but not least , the model also describes the momentum distribution of direct @xmath5 s , including the low mass region where earlier models , most notably the com , fails .",
    "this shows that there is no need to invoke new hadronic states such as hybrids or bound diquark anti - diquark states to explain this region .",
    "instead this comes out naturally from our model as a consequence of the non - perturbative dynamics involved in the hadronisation process .",
    "the overall conclusion of our study is that it is possible to describe and understand a wealth of data on @xmath0-meson decays with our relatively simple model based on the framework of soft colour interactions , which modify the colour structure of an event and thereby the string - field topology leading to different hadronic final states .",
    "the fact that this sci model has earlier been successful in describing a wide range of phenomena , such as rapidity gap events and charmonium production in both hadron - hadron and electron - proton collisions , and now @xmath0-meson decays shows that it captures essential _ generic _ features of non - perturbative qcd interactions .",

    "<S> we present a new model , based on colour rearrangements , which at the same time can describe both hidden and open charm production in @xmath0-meson decays . the model is successfully compared to both inclusive decays , such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as well as exclusive ones , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it also gives a good description of the momentum distribution of direct @xmath5 s , especially in the low - momentum region , which earlier has been claimed as a possible signal for new exotic states . </S>"
