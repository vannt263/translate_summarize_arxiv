    ", we see that there is excellent discriminating power of many standard deviations to determine whether the normal or the inverted mass hierarchy is realized . however , as @xmath192 increases the number of @xmath110 events become approximately equal and the discriminating power diminishes .",
    "the absolute scale of neutrino masses ( say @xmath192 ) can also be determined by measuring @xmath191 , but only if @xmath197 is not too large compared to @xmath198 .",
    "this is because , a given ( statistical ) uncertainty @xmath194 corresponds to an uncertainty on the mass given by @xmath199 .",
    "thus , for @xmath200 the masses become approximately degenerate , @xmath201 , due to which @xmath202 , and the uncertainty @xmath203 becomes worse . from fig .",
    "[ amuem1.fig ] we see that we can determine @xmath192 by measuring @xmath191 , and the horizontal error - bars shows the uncertainty in the inferred value of @xmath192 due to the ( statistical ) uncertainty @xmath194 on the measured @xmath191 .",
    "this might provide a means to measure the absolute scale of neutrino mass ( @xmath192 ) which can not be done through neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "for example , in the normal mass scheme if @xmath204  ev , at the lhc we would measure an asymmetry @xmath205 , where the error is the statistical uncertainty for @xmath195 . from this measurement , we infer from eq .",
    "( [ amue.eq ] ) that @xmath206  ev , and this error is shown in fig .",
    "[ amuem1.fig ] as the horizontal error - bar . for @xmath207",
    "ev the horizontal error - bars get progressively larger and we do not show them in the figure to reduce clutter . if @xmath192 is indeed large in nature , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ sigsca.eq ] ) that from the measured bulk neutrino production cross section , we can at best only determine the ratio @xmath208 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : hadron_cs ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the neutrino oscillation probability from an active species to the ( sterile ) heavier kk modes is also proportional to @xmath208  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears that in the degenerate mass case , it would not be possible to disentangle @xmath209 and @xmath75 even if we observed the collider signature that we have been considering ; this would still be the case if we also observed a finite oscillation probability into the heavier kk states .    in eq .",
    "( [ lbfit.eq ] ) , for simplicity , we assumed @xmath210 to be zero .",
    "if we had not done so , one might wonder if @xmath191 has any sensitivity to the small angle associated with @xmath210 .",
    "we do not expect this to be measurable since the change in the numbers of @xmath196 and @xmath131 events would be much smaller than the statistical uncertainties involved .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the @xmath211-@xmath196 ( or @xmath211-@xmath131 ) asymmetry does not add any information in probing the neutrino masses .",
    "we consider a theory with right - handed neutrinos propagating in @xmath0 large extra dimensions , with radius @xmath22 , and coupled to the left - handed neutrino by the higgs boson yukawa coupling .",
    "such a theory naturally explains the smallness of the neutrino mass scale , in addition to addressing the gauge hierarchy problem in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "presently the combination of neutrino oscillation data leave undetermined the absolute neutrino mass scale @xmath212 which lead us to present our results for the normal , inverted and degenerate mass schemes .",
    "in addition , the observables that we analyze depend on @xmath0 and @xmath75 of the extra - dimensional theory .",
    "we take the fundamental scale of gravity @xmath14 to be the electroweak scale @xmath213 .",
    "we showed in our previous work  @xcite that neutrino oscillation and unitarity in higgs - higgs scattering places a lower bound on @xmath75 , particularly strong for @xmath214 .",
    "we thus restricted our consideration to theories with @xmath215 , and we pointed out that the bounds we derived were somewhat uncertain for @xmath216 , since the observables depended on the cutoff ( @xmath14 ) of the theory . here , we present our results choosing @xmath75 to be around this lower bound , although not imposing the bound strictly due to the uncertainty just mentioned .",
    "we show that the higgs boson production at a collider and its decay can be enhanced significantly owing to the large number of kaluza - klein ( kk ) neutrino states that can be produced in the final state . to probe this theory we consider the signal process @xmath217 at hadron colliders , such as the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the production cross section is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : prod_cs ] ) for @xmath218 .",
    "we find for instance , for @xmath74 , @xmath219  kev , we could detect a signal at the lhc with a luminosity @xmath177 .",
    "in addition to the sm decay mode of the higgs boson @xmath220 , we also consider the new invisible decay mode @xmath221 . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : decay_br ] ) , the invisible decay mode dominates for smaller @xmath75 .",
    "we perform a monte carlo analysis of the signal process along with the sm backgrounds , and find that the higgs boson decaying invisibly , leading to a @xmath222 signature , is more promising compared to the @xmath220 decay mode .",
    "we apply the cuts shown in table  [ tbl : invis - cuts ] to enhance the signal relative to the background , and show the resulting significance in fig .",
    "( [ fig : significance ] ) .",
    "we find a significance in the @xmath223 range for @xmath74 and @xmath224  ev for normal and inverted mass hierarchies , and @xmath225  ev for the degenerate mass scheme .",
    "we only consider the positive charged lepton and the @xmath226  decay mode of the @xmath167 . including the negative charged lepton and the @xmath227  decay mode of the @xmath211 will improve the situation somewhat .    finally , we point out that if a positive signal is found that is compatible with the extra - dimensional hypothesis considered here , the asymmetry in the number of @xmath131 versus @xmath196 events can be used to distinguish between the neutrino mass schemes and to determine the absolute neutrino mass scale , and the accuracies with which these can be determined are shown in fig .",
    "( [ amuem1.fig ] ) .",
    "the collider might be a unique place to determine this information as it is not available from neutrino oscillation experiments .",
