    "the experimental determination of isoscaling  xu , johnston , laforest , tsang , tsang2001 has prompted a vigorous study of its origins and its implications on the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter . isoscaling is the property that fragment yields of similar , but isotopically different , reactions depend exponentially on the neutron ( @xmath0 ) and proton ( @xmath1 ) numbers through @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are fitting parameters .    in the past , this power law expression for @xmath5 has been linked , under diverse approximations , to primary yields produced by disassembling infinite equilibrated systems in microcanonical and grand canonical ensembles  tsang , souza , as well as in canonical ensembles  @xcite , and it has also been observed in the framework of the grand - canonical limit of the statistical multifragmentation model  @xcite , in the expanding - emitting source model  @xcite , and in the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics model  @xcite . furthermore , under these approximations , the isoscaling parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 have been found to be related to the symmetry term of the nuclear binding energy  tsang2001,botvina , to the level of isospin equilibration  @xcite , and to the values of transport coefficients  @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , it has been determined through the use of molecular dynamics  @xcite that isoscaling can exist in purely classical systems , and that it can be created in systems fully out of equilibrium .",
    "it was also found , among other things , that @xmath5 can maintain the power - law behavior even when it contains yield contributions generated at different times and corresponding to diverse thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the implications of these findings are many and very important .",
    "isoscaling is not a quantum process ; @xmath4-decay , pauli s exclusion principle and its implications for isospin selection can not be possible causes of isoscaling . isoscaling exists in finite systems out of equilibrium ; expanding systems with rapidly varying temperatures and chemical potentials obey isoscaling .",
    "the isoscaling ratio , @xmath5 , contains contributions from different times of the reaction ; its final value does not necessarily correspond to the thermodynamic conditions of a period of the reaction .",
    "this , of course , if not invalidates the scenarios and conclusions presented by previous studies , at least casts a shadow of doubt on them and , especially , on the assumed physical meanings of the isoscaling parameters @xmath3 and @xmath8 .    in view of the present situation ,",
    "the question that needs to be addressed remains the same as in our previous study  @xcite , what produces isoscaling ? answering this question is now , in a way , simpler than in our previous work as many reaction variables have been eliminated out of the search . after removing the need for quantum effects and for thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "it is clear that isoscaling should , then , exist in systems with little more than protons and neutrons without specific interactions or dynamics .",
    "the origin of isoscaling must then lie in the sampling ( _ i.e. _ mode of fragmentation ) of a conglomerate of protons and neutrons and perhaps , since we are dealing with finite systems , on its geometry and homogeneity .",
    "this work aims at elucidating the origin of isoscaling by searching for this effect in a system with the bare minimum number of ingredients , namely bond percolation model . after presenting the model in the next section , results of the percolation of hundreds of thousands of three",
    "- dimensional grids are presented in section  [ num ] , followed with a number of conclusions in section  [ concl ] .",
    "in order to explore the behavior of isoscaling we use a three dimensional bond percolation model .",
    "this model was first applied in nuclear multifragmentation by bauer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and used by many groups  @xcite ever since . in the usual bond percolation model , a fragmenting nucleus",
    "is represented by a three - dimensional cubic lattice , and individual nucleons  by nodes on the lattice .",
    "all nodes start with bonds to all nearest - neighbors , which represent nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "these bonds are then attempted to be broken statistically according to a probability @xmath9 , thus producing clusters of connected nodes which are interpreted as fragments .    to this usual model , we add the `` isospin '' of the nodes as an extra degree of freedom . with this method ,",
    "lattices with different ratios of `` protons '' and `` neutrons '' can be constructed and ruptured , producing cluster yields which can then be used to construct the ratio @xmath5 . besides the usual assumptions of bond percolation",
    ", the following three conditions are added in this analysis : @xmath10 the bond breaking probability , @xmath9 , is spatially homogeneous and identical for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 bonds , @xmath14 the probability of a node for having isospin `` up '' ( @xmath15 ) or `` down '' ( @xmath16 ) is spatially homogeneous , and @xmath17 ) the number of protons and neutrons is fixed from the beginning .      in this model , fragments are obtained when bonds are broken with a given probability @xmath9 . if we consider the infinite size limit is customary to express the number of fragments as the number of fragments per node @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the size of the lattice measured in nodes , @xmath20 is the number of fragments of size @xmath21 , and @xmath22 the number of fragments of size @xmath21 per node .",
    "this last quantity can be written in the following way @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for the perimeter of the cluster ( number of bonds to be broken in order to isolate the cluster composed by @xmath21 nodes ) , and @xmath25 is the number of bonds linking the @xmath21 nodes , @xmath26 is the number of cluster configurations with size @xmath27 perimeter @xmath24 and @xmath25 activated bonds . as an illustration , figure  [ fig1 ] shows the different terms appearing in the expression for @xmath28 in the two dimensional case .",
    "the resulting expression for this term is @xmath29    .",
    ", width=377 ]    to include the isospin degree of freedom , a given node belonging to a cluster of size @xmath21 will be considered to be a proton with probability @xmath15",
    ". then @xmath30 \\left [ \\underset{% z=0,a}{\\sum } \\alpha _ { z}p^{z}(1-p)^{(a - z)}\\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath31 being the number of ways of building a cluster with @xmath1 protons and @xmath32 neutrons : @xmath33 the number of fragments per node with @xmath21 particles and @xmath1 protons is then defined as : @xmath34=n_{a}\\alpha _ { z}p^{z}q^{n } \\ .\\ ] ]    focusing now on the isoscaling problem , the quantity of interest is the quotient : @xmath35 with @xmath36 representing the yield for the reaction involving the neutron rich nuclei .    for the percolation model , @xmath5 takes the form @xmath37_{2}}{[n_{a , z}]_{1}}=\\frac{p_{2}^{z}q_{2}^{n } } { p_{1}^{z}q_{1}^{n}}=\\left ( \\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\\right ) ^{z}\\left ( \\frac{q_{2 } } { q_{1}}\\right ) ^{n}\\ ,   \\label{r12p}\\ ] ] in which all the geometrical and combinatorial terms cancel out and only the part related to the occupancy probabilities remains .",
    "in this way @xmath38 \\right\\ } = \\exp \\left [ n\\ln \\left ( \\frac{q_{2}}{q_{1}}\\right ) + z\\ln \\left ( \\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\\right ) \\right ] = \\exp \\left ( \\alpha n+\\beta z\\right ) \\ .\\ ] ] which is the standard expression of the isoscaling coefficient , but now with a clear microscopic interpretation for the isoscaling parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    for finite lattices ,",
    "it is convenient to study @xmath5 calculated in terms of the number of fragments @xmath39 instead of the above derivation in terms of the number of fragments per node , @xmath40 .",
    "this can be achieved by using the above derived expressions for the constants @xmath6 and @xmath41 .",
    "equation  ( [ r12p ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath42 _ { 2}}{\\left [ n_{a , z}\\right ] _ { 1}}\\approx \\frac{a_{2}[n_{a , z}]_{2}}{a_{1}[n_{a , z}]_{1}}=\\frac{a_{2}}{z}\\frac{z}{a_{1}}% \\left ( \\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\\right ) ^{z}\\left ( \\frac{q_{2}}{q_{1}}\\right ) ^{n}=\\left ( \\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\\right ) ^{z-1}\\left ( \\frac{q_{2}}{q_{1}}% \\right ) ^{n}\\]]where the probabilities have been approximated by @xmath43 .",
    "this immediately yields the usual expression : @xmath44with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47=p_{1}/p_{2}=a_{2}/a_{1}$ ]    it should be kept in mind that the main assumptions in this derivation are that the probability @xmath15 is homogenous and that the number of fragments per node ( per particle ) can be approximated by the corresponding infinite size limit .",
    "we now turn to a numerical verification of these predictions .",
    "to explore the isoscaling phenomena in the framework of the above defined percolation model , two different types of calculations were performed : fixing the number of protons in the lattice , and using a fixed probability to assign the isospin to the nodes .      in this case , the @xmath5 was obtained using the yields of two lattices , one of size @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ with @xmath49 nodes , and a second one of @xmath50 with @xmath51 nodes , both with the number of protons fixed to @xmath52 .",
    "these grids , had , then , @xmath53 , and probabilities @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the @xmath56 grid , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for the @xmath50 grid .    for these probabilities ,",
    "the isoscaling coefficients are @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and the constant @xmath63 .",
    "the results of @xmath64 percolations of each of these grids are displayed in panel @xmath65 of figure  [ fig2 ] .      in this second case ,",
    "the two isotopically different grids were constructed with the same sizes for both , but with two different protons and neutrons occupation probabilities .",
    "several cases were studied .",
    "first , @xmath48 grids were constructed using @xmath54 and @xmath66 which yields a total number of protons ( in average ) of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 which yields a total number of protons ( in average ) of @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the coefficients are : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the results obtained from this numerical exercise are displayed in panel b ) of figure  [ fig2 ] ; the fact that isoscaling is well reproduced by this purely geometrical model is obvious from this figure .",
    "next , to investigate size effects , a similar case was constructed using a smaller lattice of size @xmath77 with the same probabilities as in the previous case .",
    "the corresponding results are displayed in panel c ) of figure  [ fig2 ] ; again the property of isoscaling is apparent .    finally , to investigate the effect of different occupation probabilities on @xmath78 , one more case was studied . in this case , a lattice of @xmath48 was populated with protons and neutrons according to the probabilities : @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for the neutron rich partner",
    "the probabilities used were @xmath79 and @xmath80 which yields a total number of protons ( on average ) of @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath84 . in this case",
    "the coefficients are @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in panel d ) of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "for each of these cases @xmath64 configurations were generated .",
    "the bond breaking probability was chosen as @xmath87 in order to get good statistics in an ample range of masses .",
    "[ attempts with different values of the breaking probability @xmath9 demonstrated that the ratio @xmath5 is independent of @xmath9 . ]",
    "the figure also shows a comparison of the numerical results to the theoretical predictions of section  [ num ] , lines denote theoretical predictions whereas symbols denote numerical simulations .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical predictions and the results of the simulations is remarkable .",
    "we have studied the isoscaling phenomenon in the frame of percolation model . we have derived exact analytic expressions for the infinite case and approximate ones for the finite case .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations for not too big systems ( @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 particles ) with different relative populations of n : z . the excellent agreement between numerical simulations and theory",
    "indicate that isoscaling emerges from the simple assumption of fair sampling with homogeneous probabilities . on the other hand",
    ", this property can be seen as a minimum information approach , _",
    "i.e. _ all configurations are equiprobable , as such this analysis can be interpreted in the frame of a maximum entropy approach .",
    "this indicates that the information about effects due , for example , to the asymmetry term in the equation of state , is in the absolute values of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath4 , and not in the isoscaling property itself .        h.  s. xu , m. b. tsang , t. x. liu , x. d. liu , w. g. lynch , w. p. tan , a. vander molen , g. verde , a. wagner , h. f. xi , c. k. gelbke , l. beaulieu , b. davin , y. larochelle , t. lefort , r. t. de souza , r. yanez , v. e. viola , r. j. charity and l. g. sobotka , _ phys .",
