    "we consider the problem arising in wireless communication of coding for a multiple antenna system , where the transmitter has twice more antennas than the receiver .",
    "codes for that setting fall into the category of asymmetric space - time codes , and are usually formed of @xmath3 complex matrices .",
    "the case when the receiver has exactly two antennas is called a mido channel ( which stands for multiple input double output ) .",
    "particular attention has recently been paid to the mido case , due to its potential application to digital tv broadcast , where the end user carries a portable tv device .",
    "many good space - time codes are available in the literature , in that they satisfy the _ full diversity _ property requiring that @xmath4 for any two matrices @xmath5 in the codebook - ensuring good behavior at high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , and the _ non - vanishing determinant ( nvd ) _ property , which states that @xmath6 is bounded away from zero , even for an infinite space - time code , thus guaranteeing that the code performs well irrespectively of the alphabet size .",
    "however , most of the codes enjoying the above properties in fact possess an underlying lattice structure , and might suffer from high maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding complexity .",
    "this triggered a new line of research focusing on designing codes with both good performance and reduced ml decoding complexity via sphere decoding @xcite , called _ fast decodable codes _ @xcite .",
    "analysis of conditions under which a code satisfies fast decodability can be found in e.g. @xcite , where the notions of _ fast decodable _ , _ group decodable _ and _ conditionally group decodable _ are detailed .",
    "several @xmath7-dimensional fast decodable mido codes have subsequently been studied , attempting to improve on the mido code in @xcite , which combines a quasi - orthogonal code with a twisted unitary transformation of another quasi - orthogonal code , and gets a lower decoding complexity , by sacrificing the full diversity property , and consequently the stronger nvd property . in @xcite , cyclic algebra",
    "based codewords are arranged in an alamouti block code @xcite fashion to gain fast decodability for asymmetric space - time codes .",
    "recent fast decodable code constructions include a fully diverse mido code conjectured to have the nvd property @xcite , and mido codes with the nvd property based on crossed product algebras @xcite .",
    "constructions for arbitrary number of transmit antennas are also available in @xcite .",
    "we consider transmission over a coherent rayleigh fading channel with @xmath1 transmit antennas , @xmath2 receive antennas and perfect channel state information at the receiver ( csir ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the channel matrix and @xmath10 is the noise at the receiver , both with i.i.d zero mean complex gaussian components .",
    "the @xmath3 space - time code @xmath11 can transmit up to @xmath12 complex ( say qam ) information symbols , or equivalently @xmath13 real ( say pam ) information symbols .",
    "we will focus on the full - rate case where indeed @xmath13 real symbols are sent . when @xmath14 , @xmath11 is sometimes referred to as mido space - time code , where mido stands for multiple input double output .",
    "maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding consists of finding the codeword @xmath11 that achieves the minimum of the squared frobenius norm @xmath15 by describing the space - time code @xmath11 in terms of basis matrices @xmath16 , @xmath17 and a pam vector @xmath18 as @xmath19 we can rewrite ( [ frob - min ] ) in euclidean norm as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the channel output which has been vectorized , with real and imaginary parts separated , and @xmath22 also obtained by vectorizing and separating the real and imaginary parts of @xmath23 to obtain @xmath24 .",
    "this search can then be performed using a real sphere decoder @xcite .",
    "we will focus on two aspects of space - time code design : diversity and fast decodability .    *",
    "full diversity .",
    "* it is well known @xcite that the first important space - time code design criterion is _ full diversity _",
    ", that is , we require @xmath25 , for any @xmath5 in the codebook .",
    "when @xmath26 is again a codeword for all @xmath27 , the full diversity criterion simplifies to @xmath28    * fast decodability . * from ( [ eq : dlatt ] ) , a qr decomposition of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 unitary , reduces to computing @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an upper right triangular matrix and @xmath34 denotes the hermitian transpose .",
    "the number and position of nonzero elements in the upper right part of @xmath33 will determine the complexity of the sphere decoding process .",
    "if @xmath35 is the real alphabet in use , and @xmath36 is the number of independent real information symbols from @xmath35 within one code matrix , then the _ ml decoding complexity _",
    "@xcite is the minimum number of values of @xmath37 in ( [ eq : dr ] ) that should be computed while performing ml decoding .",
    "note that @xmath36 will sometimes be referred to as the rank or dimension of the code , which corresponds to the number of basis matrices , @xmath38 in our case .",
    "the worst case is given when the matrix @xmath33 is a full upper right triangular matrix , yielding the complexity of the exhaustive - search ml decoder , that is here @xmath39 , with @xmath38 and @xmath40 is the number of pam symbols in use .",
    "if the structure of the code is such that the decoding complexity has an exponent of @xmath40 smaller than @xmath13 , we say that the code is _ fast - decodable_.    we now recall three shapes of matrix @xmath33 which have been shown @xcite to result in reduced decoding complexity .",
    "suppose a space - time code has matrix @xmath33 of the form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a @xmath43 diagonal matrix and @xmath44 is upper - triangular .",
    "then decoding complexity of the code is reduced to @xmath45 .",
    "the matrix @xmath33 , which depends on the channel matrix @xmath9 , may be difficult to compute .",
    "thankfully , the zero structure of @xmath33 is actually related @xcite to the zero structure of the matrix @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 which captures information about orthogonality relations of the basis elements @xmath16 , with @xmath48 denoting hermitian transpose .",
    "it furthermore has the advantage that its zero structure is stable under premultiplication of @xmath49 by a channel matrix @xmath9 ( in general , the same does not hold for @xmath33 ) .",
    "it was shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) that @xmath50 where @xmath42 is a @xmath51-dimensional diagonal matrix .",
    "it is thus sufficient to compute @xmath46 to deduce fast - decodability .",
    "a space - time code of dimension @xmath36 is called _",
    "g - group decodable _ if there exists a partition of @xmath52 into @xmath53 nonempty subsets @xmath54 , so that @xmath55 when @xmath56 are in disjoint subsets @xmath57 .    in this case , as shown in @xcite , the matrix @xmath33 has the form @xmath58 , where each @xmath59 is a square upper triangular matrix .",
    "hence , the symbols @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be decoded independently when their corresponding basis matrices @xmath62 and @xmath63 belong to disjoint subsets of the induced partition of the basis , yielding a decoding complexity of @xmath64 .",
    "finally , a code might not be a @xmath53-group decodable code , but could become one assuming that a set of symbols are already decoded .",
    "this corresponds to another characterization of fast - decodability @xcite :    a code is called _ conditionally @xmath53-group decodable _ if there exists a partition of @xmath65 into @xmath66 disjoint subsets @xmath67 ,  , @xmath68 , @xmath69 such that @xmath70    in this case , the sphere decoding complexity order reduces to @xmath71 .    by the above discussion , in order to demonstrate fast - decodability , respectively ( conditional ) @xmath53-group decodability , it suffices to find an ordering on the basis elements @xmath16 , which results in the desired zero structure of @xmath46 .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of designing full - rate space - time codes for @xmath1 transmit and @xmath2 receive asymmetric mimo channels .",
    "our main contributions are :    1 .",
    "we propose a general code construction that maps two rank-@xmath2 algebraic space - time codes coming from a cyclic algebra to a rank-@xmath1 new code and give a criterion for full diversity .",
    "we obtain a novel way of constructing division algebras , and describe their center and one maximal subfield .",
    "we provide a decoding complexity analysis that permits to derive conditions under which the iterated code inherits fast - decodable properties of the underlying code .",

    "this code should be of @xmath0-rank 18 , so that the iterated code is of desired @xmath0-rank 36 .",
    "let @xmath605 be a @xmath87-basis of @xmath606 , such that all @xmath607 , e.g. @xmath608 .",

    "since @xmath87 is of degree 2 over @xmath322 , this is more rate than we can support , namely @xmath614 complex symbols instead of @xmath424 .",
    "let us write @xmath615 as @xmath616 by setting two @xmath617 to zero , we will obtain the right rate . instead of the @xmath0-basis @xmath618 of @xmath87 , we will thus use a subset @xmath619 . for reasons of fast - decodability",
    "we insist that @xmath620 be real ( @xmath620 is 1 or @xmath621 ) and @xmath622 be totally imaginary ( @xmath622 is @xmath226 or @xmath623 ) .",
    "we obtain from a @xmath87-basis of @xmath80 the following @xmath0-linearly independent set for @xmath624 : @xmath625 @xmath626 @xmath627 where we denote @xmath628 for short .",
    "we have @xmath629 using the fact that @xmath630 have only real coefficients , and commute since they are diagonal .",
    "furthermore , @xmath620 was also real , while @xmath622 is totally imaginary .",

    "@xmath634    at the price of sacrificing full - diversity , we may choose @xmath581 .",
    "this will result in additional relations : @xmath635 for all @xmath636 , implying decoding complexity @xmath637 using ( * ? ? ? * lemma 2 ) , rather than the worst case @xmath638 for the given code .",

    "to see this , we use similar arguments as in example [ ex:6x3example1 ] to demonstrate that @xmath73 is a non - norm element in the extension @xmath555 .",
    "namely , @xmath73 multiplicatively generates nonzero elements of @xmath644 , which is the residue field of the ideal above @xmath645 in @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the image of @xmath73 in @xmath646 can not lie in the kernel of the epimorphism @xmath647 .",

    "each matrix encodes @xmath424 elements of @xmath87 , or @xmath614 elements of @xmath0 , since this time @xmath87 is of degree 2 over @xmath0 . for the iterative construction , first we observe that @xmath650 is an element whose cube is not fixed by @xmath90 .",
    "hence , by lemma [ conditionfd3 ] the elements in the image of @xmath651 have nonzero determinant , moreover since @xmath652 , lemma [ normconditionn ] implies that the resulting code has nvd .",
    "we set the code to be the matrices in the image of @xmath653 , and by lemma [ lem : fd ] , fast - decodable properties of @xmath80 are inherited .",
    "similar computations as in the previous example can be done .",
    "motivated by the code design of fast decodable space - time codes for asymmetric mimo channels , we proposed an iterated code construction , that maps a space - time block code coming from a cyclic division algebra into a new space - time code of twice the original dimension .",
    "we studied the algebraic structure of the newly obtained codes , which are actually forming interesting families of division algebras , whose center and maximal subfield are computed .",
    "in particular , we gave a condition for full diversity .",
    "particular attention was paid to the quaternion case , corresponding to the mido case .",
    "it is surely possible to obtain other ( possibly better ) codes from the general construction that we proposed .",
    "it would be a valuable contribution to establish a bound on the best decoding complexity that codes coming from division algebras can have . from a purely mathematical point of view , it would be of interest classify the division algebras that are built through the proposed iterative construction .",
