    "the polonyi problem  @xcite is one of the most serious problems in models based on the @xmath6 supergravity  @xcite . in a wide class of supergravity models ,",
    "the polonyi field @xmath7 , which is a scalar field related to the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking , has a mass @xmath8 of the order of the gravitino mass . during inflation",
    ", @xmath7 takes an amplitude of the order of the gravitational scale @xmath9 . after the inflation ,",
    "the condensation of @xmath7 starts to oscillate when the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath10 , becomes comparable to @xmath8 and finally decays into particles in the observable sector .",
    "since the interactions of the polonyi field are suppressed by powers of @xmath11 , the decay rate of the polonyi field , @xmath12 , is very small as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of the decay modes .",
    "( in the following calculations , we take @xmath15 . )",
    "therefore , the polonyi field is expected to decay when the temperature of the universe becomes very low .",
    "the reheating temperature @xmath16 due to the decay of the polonyi field is given by @xmath17 this causes serious cosmological difficulties ; namely the polonyi field may destroy the great success of the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and the entropy production due to its decay may dilute the baryon number of the universe too much .    in the previous works  @xcite",
    "it has been pointed out that the polonyi problem can be solved if the gravitino mass @xmath18 ( which is the same order of the polonyi mass ) is larger than @xmath19 in order to hasten the decay of the polonyi field .",
    "thus , it is desirable to raise the gravitino mass while keeping the effective susy breaking scale in the observable sector at @xmath20 . in no - scale",
    "type supergravity models , such mass hierarchy is realized  @xcite and hence the no - scale type supergravity model with @xmath21 has been suggested as an attractive solution to the polonyi problem .    in reference  @xcite ,",
    "however , it has been also pointed out that the mass density of the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) produced by the decay of the polonyi field may overclose our universe if lsp is stable . as we will see below , the mass density of lsp increases as the reheating temperature @xmath16 due to the decay of the polonyi field decreases .",
    "therefore , a lowerbound on @xmath16 is derived requiring that the present mass density of lsp should not exceed the critical density of the universe @xmath22 . in this letter",
    ", we obtain the lowerbound on @xmath16 in the framework of the minimal susy su(5 ) model with no - scale type boundary conditions on the susy breaking parameters .",
    "before starting cosmological arguments , let us first describe our basic assumptions . we consider the minimal susy su(5 ) model with no - scale type boundary conditions .",
    "this model has three types of higgs field ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 which contain flavor higgses @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27 whose condensation breaks the su(5 ) group into the gauge group of the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) , @xmath28 . for the higgs sector ,",
    "the superpotential is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are dimensionless constants , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are mass parameters which are of the order of the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the model also has the soft susy breaking terms ; @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are susy breaking parameters . minimising the higgs potential ,",
    "we find the following stationary point ; @xmath40 where the su(5 ) is broken down to @xmath28 . regarding this stationary point as the vacuum , we obtain mssm as the effective theory below the gut scale @xmath41 . here",
    ", the masslessness of the flavor higgses @xmath25 and @xmath26 is achieved by a fine tuning among several parameters ; @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the susy - invariant higgs mass in mssm .    in the present model ,",
    "the parameters in mssm at the electroweak scale is obtained by solving renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "our method is as follows .",
    "the boundary conditions on the parameters in the minimal susy su(5 ) model are given at the gravitational scale @xmath44 .",
    "since we assume the no - scale type supergravity models , all the susy breaking parameters except for the gaugino mass vanish at the gravitational scale . from the gravitational scale to the gut scale , the parameters follow the renormalization group flow derived from rges in the minimal susy su(5 ) model . then we determine the parameters in mssm at the gut scale through an appropriate matching condition between the parameters in the susy su(5 ) model and those in mssm .",
    "finally , we use rges in mssm from the gut scale to the electroweak scale in order to obtain the low energy parameters .    as for the matching condition",
    ", we have a comment . in the stationary point ( [ vac_su5 ] ) , the mixing soft mass term of the two flavor higgs bosons , @xmath45 , is generated at the tree level , where @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 } _ { \\mu = m_{\\rm gut } }        \\label{m12 ^ 2}\\ ] ] since the mixing mass term depends on unknown parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eq.([w_su5 ] ) , we regard @xmath46 as a free parameter taking account of the uncertainty of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in our analysis . then , the low energy parameters are essentially determined by the gauge and yukawa coupling constants and the following three parameters ; the supersymmetric higgs mass @xmath43 , the mixing mass of the two flavor higgs bosons @xmath46 , and the unified gaugino mass.in fact , parameters in mssm slightly depend on the parameters in the susy gut such as @xmath30 , @xmath31 and so on . in our numerical calculation",
    ", we ignore the effects of these parameters on the renormalization group flow .",
    "however , it is more convenient to express these parameters by other physical ones .",
    "in fact , one combination of them is constrained so that the flavor higgs bosons have correct vacuum expectation values ; @xmath48 .",
    "as the other two physical parameters , we use the mass of lsp , @xmath49 , and the vacuum angle @xmath50 .",
    "thus , once we fix @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we can determine all the parameters in mssm.yukawa coupling constants are determined so that the fermions have correct masses .",
    "the gauge coupling constants are also fixed so that their correct values at the electroweak scale are reproduced . following the above procedure",
    ", we solve the rges numerically , and obtain the low energy parameters in mssm .",
    "then , we determine the mass spectrum and the mixing angles for all superparticles .",
    "one remarkable thing is that _ lsp almost consists of bino @xmath53 which is the superpartner of the gauge field for @xmath54 _ if we require that lsp is neutral .",
    "therefore , in our model , the lsp mass @xmath51 is essentially equivalent to the bino mass .",
    "this fact simplifies the following analysis very much .",
    "now we are in a position to discuss the mass density of lsp produced by the decay of the polonyi field .",
    "the decay of the polonyi field produces a large number of superparticles , which promptly decay into lsps . the number density of lsp produced by the decay , @xmath55 , is of the same order of that of the polonyi field @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 being the energy density of the polonyi field ) . just after the decay of the polonyi field , the yield variable for lsp , @xmath58 , which is defined by the ratio of the number density of lsp to the entropy density @xmath59 ,",
    "is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass density of lsp just after the decay of the polonyi field . if lsp is stable and the pair annihilation of lsp is not effective , @xmath58",
    "is conserved until today . comparing the ratio given in eq.([my_lsp ] ) with the ratio of the critical density @xmath22 to the present entropy density @xmath62 , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the hubble constant in units of 100km / sec / mpc",
    ", we see that lsp overcloses the universe in the wide parameter region for @xmath65 and @xmath16 which we are concerned with .",
    "if the pair annihilation of lsp takes place effectively , its abundance is reduced to @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the annihilation cross section , @xmath68 is the relative velocity , and @xmath69 represents the average over the phase space distribution of lsp . from eq.([abundance_lsp ] ) , we obtain a lowerbound on the annihilation cross section , @xmath70 in order that the mass density of lsp does not overclose the universe .    comparing this bound with the annihilation cross section of lsp ,",
    "we derive a bound on the reheating temperature by the decay of the polonyi field . since lsp is most dominated by bino , it annihilates into fermion pairs .",
    "the annihilation cross section is given by  @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the average velocity of lsp , and @xmath73 here , @xmath74 represents the fine structure constant for u(1)@xmath75 , @xmath76 the top - quark mass , @xmath77 the hypercharge of the fermion @xmath78 , and @xmath79 the mass of the sfermion @xmath80 .",
    "notice that @xmath81 and @xmath82 terms correspond to @xmath59- and @xmath83-wave contributions , respectively .",
    "taking @xmath84 , the annihilation cross section given in eq.([sigma*v ] ) is at most @xmath85 . using this result in the inequality ( [ sv_limit ] )",
    ", we can see that the reheating temperature must be higher than about 100mev even if @xmath86 .",
    "if the average velocity is smaller than 1 , the constraint becomes more stringent , as we will see below .",
    "in order to obtain the precise lowerbound on the reheating temperature @xmath16 , we have to know @xmath72 , as well as the mass spectrum of the superparticles on which the annihilation cross section depends .",
    "first , let us discuss the averaged velocity of lsp , @xmath87 .",
    "since lsp is mostly the bino , it loses its energy by scattering off the background fermions . in the model with the no - scale type boundary conditions ,",
    "right - handed sleptons become the lightest among the sfermions , and hence lsp loses its energy mainly by scattering off the background electron ( and @xmath88 and @xmath89 , if the temperature is higher than their masses ) .",
    "if lsp is relativistic , the cross section for this process , @xmath90 , is estimated as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the energy of lsp , and @xmath93 the mass of the right - handed selectron.this cross section is applied for @xmath94 .",
    "the energy loss rate for the relativistic lsp , @xmath95 , is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 represents the number density of the background electron and @xmath98 is the averaged energy loss of lsp in one scattering which is given by @xmath99 taking the ratio of the energy loss rate @xmath100 to the expansion rate @xmath10 of the universe , we find @xmath101 thus , if @xmath102 a few @xmath103 10mev , the energetic lsp loses its energy through the scattering off thermal electrons efficiently for @xmath104 , and becomes a non - relativistic particle .",
    "the non - relativistic lsp further loses its energy by scattering off background electrons .",
    "the averaged loss of the kinetic energy for the non - relativistic lsp in one scattering process , @xmath105 , is given by is @xmath106 .",
    "however this order of the energy loss is cancelled out when the average is taken over angles of the incident particles and the actual energy loss is much smaller than the naive expectation . ]",
    "@xmath107 where @xmath108 is the kinetic energy of lsp . as one can see in eq.([delta_e ] ) , the lsp which has a kinetic energy larger than @xmath109 tends to lose its energy through the scattering process , while lsp receives energy from the thermal bath if its energy is smaller than @xmath109 .",
    "thus , if the scattering processes take place effectively , the averaged kinetic energy of lsp becomes @xmath109 , _",
    "i.e. _ lsp goes into the kinetic equilibrium .",
    "the energy loss rate @xmath110 for the non - relativistic lsp is given by @xmath111 the lsp goes into the kinetic equilibrium if the scattering rate @xmath110 is larger than the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "taking @xmath112 , the ratio of @xmath110 to the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath10 , is given by @xmath113 thus , if the reheating temperature is higher than about 10mev , produced lsps go into kinetic equilibrium as far as @xmath114gev .",
    "furthermore , as we discussed in the previous section , the reheating temperature should be higher than at least 100mev in order to decrease the mass density of lsp sufficiently .",
    "thus , we conclude that the produced lsps go into kinetic equilibrium if we require that the mass density of the relic lsp should not overclose the universe.by the numerical calculation we have checked , in fact , that the scattering rate given in eq.([gamma_scatt ] ) is always larger than the expansion rate of the universe when the relic lsp does not overclose the universe .",
    "( see fig.2 . ) in this case , the averaged velocity is given by @xmath115 > from this we easily see that the lsp abundance given in eq.([abundance_lsp ] ) decreases as the reheating temperature gets higher .",
    "thus , we obtain the lowerbound on the reheating temperature .",
    "once we know the averaged velocity @xmath72 , we can calculate the annihilation cross section of lsp , and get the lowerbound on the reheating temperature after the decay of the polonyi field . in this letter",
    ", we first solve rges based on the minimal su(5 ) model with the no - scale boundary conditions , and determine the mass spectrum of the superparticles .",
    "we only investigate the parameter space which is not excluded by the experimental or theoretical constraints . the constraints which we use",
    "are as follows :    * higgs bosons @xmath25 and @xmath26 have correct vacuum expectation values .",
    "* perturbative picture is valid below the gravitational scale .",
    "* lsp is neutral .",
    "* sfermions ( especially , charged sleptons ) have masses larger than the experimental lower limits  @xcite . *",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath116-boson decaying into neutralinos is not too large  @xcite .",
    "then , with the obtained mass spectrum of superparticles , we calculate the annihilation cross section and determine the lowerbound on the reheating temperature from the following equation ; @xmath117 in fig .  1",
    ", we show the lowerbound on the reheating temperature in the @xmath52 vs. @xmath51 plane . in the figures , large or small @xmath52",
    "s are not allowed since the yukawa coupling constant for the top quark or bottom quark blows up below the gravitational scale for such @xmath52 s .",
    "furthermore , there also exists a lowerbound on the lsp mass . in the case where @xmath118 , charged sfermions become lighter than the experimental limit if the lsp mass becomes lighter than @xmath119 . on the other hand , for the large @xmath52 case ,",
    "unless the bino mass is sufficiently large , the lightest charged slepton becomes lsp .",
    "( remember that the dominant component of lsp is bino . ) thus , the lowerbound on @xmath51 is obtained .",
    "as we can see , the reheating temperature should be larger than about 100mev , even for the case where @xmath120 .",
    "the constraint becomes more stringent as @xmath51 increases , since the masses of the superparticles which mediate the annihilation of lsp becomes larger as the lsp mass increases .",
    "if we translate the lowerbound on the reheating temperature into that of the polonyi mass @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath121 ( see eq.([rtemp ] ) ) .",
    "we can also see that the lowerbound is almost independent of @xmath52 . in fig .  2",
    ", we show the lowerbound on @xmath16 as a function of the lsp mass for @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .    here , we should comment on the accidental case where the annihilation process hits the higgs pole in the @xmath59-channel",
    ". if the lsp mass is just half of the lightest higgs boson mass , the lsp annihilation cross section is enhanced since lsp has small but nonvanishing fraction of higgsino component .",
    "if the parameters are well tuned , such a situation can be realized and the lowerbound of @xmath16 decreases to @xmath124 .",
    "however , we consider that such a scenario are very unnatural since a precise adjustment of the parameters is required in order to hit the higgs pole.in the case where the annihilation process hits the pole of heavier higgs bosons , the cross section is not enhanced so much , since the widths of the heavier higgs bosons are quite large .",
    "in this letter , we have obtained the lowerbound on the reheating temperature due to the decay of the polonyi field in a framework of the no - scale type supergravity model . as a result",
    ", we have seen that the polonyi mass should be larger than about 100tev which may raise a new fine - tuning problem  @xcite .",
    "we have assumed the minimal susy gut model in the present analysis .",
    "however , the main conclusion is not changed as far as lsp is mostly the bino , because the minimum value of the lowerbound ( @xmath125mev ) is obtained when the mass of the selectron takes the experimentally allowed lower limit .",
    "we have assumed that lsp is stable so far .",
    "however , if we introduce @xmath126-parity violation , lsp becomes unstable and the allowed @xmath16 is as low as a few mev .",
    "it is also the case if we assume a very light lsp such as a neutral higgsino  @xcite or an axino  @xcite whose masses are less than about 100mev .",
