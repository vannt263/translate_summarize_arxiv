    "in a free - electron laser the electromagnetic field at the fundamental harmonic interacts with the electron beam . as a result , the beam is bunched in non - linear ( sinusoidal ) ponderomotive potential . when the bunching is strong enough , the beam current exhibits non - negligible fourier components at harmonics of the fundamental as well . in the sase case only the transverse ground mode of the fundamental harmonic survives , due to the transverse mode selection mechanism @xcite in the high gain regime , and is responsible for the bunching mechanism . as a result ,",
    "the nonlinear fourier components radiate coherently and the phenomenon is referred to as ( nonlinear ) harmonic generation of coherent radiation .    the process of harmonic generation of coherent radiation can be considered as a purely electrodynamical one .",
    "in fact , the harmonics of the electron beam density are driven by the electromagnetic field at the fundamental frequency , but the bunching contribution due to the interaction of the electron beam with the radiation at higher harmonics can be neglected .",
    "this leads to important simplifications .",
    "in fact , in order to perform numerical analysis of the characteristics of higher harmonics radiation , one has to solve the self - consistent problem for the fundamental harmonic only .",
    "subsequently , the solution to this problem , that must be obtained with the help of a self - consistent code , can be used to calculate the harmonic contents of the beam current .",
    "these contents enter as known sources in our electrodynamical process : solving maxwell equations accounting for these sources gives the desired characteristics of higher harmonics radiation . as a result , simulation codes dealing with harmonic generation are not first principle codes : in fact , they simply compute the solution of maxwell equations obtaining the proper sources by means of first - principle codes .",
    "non - linear generation of the second harmonic radiation , in particular , is important for extending the attainable frequency range of an xfel facility : in fact , the high peak - brilliance increase of xfels with respect to third generation light sources ( up to eight orders of magnitude ) makes the second harmonic contents of the xfel radiation very attractive from a practical viewpoint .",
    "moreover , it is also important in connection with experiments that make use of the fundamental harmonic only .",
    "in fact one must be able to estimate correctly the higher harmonics effects to distinguish between nonlinear phenomena induced by the fundamental and linear phenomena due to the second harmonic .",
    "the subject has been a matter of theoretical studies in a high - gain sase fel both for odd @xcite and even harmonics @xcite , where the electrodynamical problem is dealt with .",
    "the practical interest of these studies is well underlined by the fact that they were followed by both numerical analysis @xcite and experiments , that have been carried out in the infra - red and in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "experimental results are compared with numerical analysis and numerical analysis rely on analytical studies : this fact stresses the importance of a correct theoretical understanding of the subject .",
    "remarkably , such understanding does not require the introduction of radically new physical mechanisms .",
    "the key ideas involved are not much different from those regarding the second harmonic generation from a single particle , treated a long time ago and presented in synchrotron radiation textbooks ( e.g. @xcite ) . a complexity though",
    ", is constituted by the presence of many electrons involved in the radiative process , each with a given offset and phase , radiating coherently , as a whole or in part , due to the longitudinal modulation of the beam current at the second harmonic .    for a given frequency component the electromagnetic wave equation dictates both a characteristic longitudinal length ( that is the radiation formation length ) and a characteristic transverse length .",
    "as we will see , when the beam transverse size is smaller than the characteristic transverse length the entire electron beam behaves like a single electron and the harmonics of the beam current are simply interpretable in terms of the harmonic contents of a single particle current : in this case , all the particles act coherently and the radiated intensity scales with the square number of the electrons in the beam . when the transverse size of the beam increases and becomes much larger than the characteristic transverse length less",
    "electrons contribute collectively to the field and if the beam current remains constant the total radiated power is decreased .",
    "the characteristic transverse length is specified in a natural way after a dimensional analysis of the problem . the first treatment @xcite of non - linear generation of even harmonics",
    "does not account for the presence of such parameter , followed in this by others @xcite .",
    "we find that these works include arbitrary manipulations of the source terms in the paraxial wave equation . among these",
    ", an important part of the source terms is systematically dropped .",
    "moreover , estimations of the second harmonic power are based on the electromagnetic sources ( after manipulation ) while exact calculations should be based on a solution of maxwell equations . altogether , we find that these works predict an incorrect dependence of the second harmonic field on the problem parameters",
    ". results of @xcite are extended in @xcite to the case of an electron beam moving off - axis through the undulator .",
    "one of the conclusions in @xcite is that the second harmonic power increases when an angle between the beam and the undulator axis is present .",
    "we find that the power of the second harmonic radiation should never increase when such angle is present : in particular , as we will see , it is independent of it in optimal situations when the microbunching wavefront is matched with the beam propagation .    in this paper , that was inspired by a method @xcite developed to deal with synchrotron radiation from complex setups , we present a theory of second harmonic generation in high - gain fels .",
    "first we give , in section [ sec : ours ] , an exact analytical solution of the wave equation for the second harmonic generation problem .",
    "the procedure employed to derive such a solution shows the advantages of a green s function method . in section [ sec :",
    "mod ] , our result is used to calculate , in a particular case , specific properties of the second harmonic radiation such as polarization , directivity diagram and total power including proper parametric dependencies .",
    "the most surprising prediction of our theory is that the electric field is not only horizontally polarized , as it is usually assumed , but exhibits , though remaining linearly polarized , a vertically polarized component too .",
    "following the presentation of our theory , in section [ sec : stat ] we comment on the differences between our approach and the present understanding of the second harmonic generation mechanism .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] , we come to conclusions .",
    "as has been said in the introduction , the process of ( second ) harmonic generation of coherent radiation is a purely electrodynamical one .",
    "first , proper initial conditions are given as input to an fel self - consistent code , which calculates the electron beam bunching from the interaction of the beam with the first harmonic radiation .",
    "then , the results from the self - consistent code are used as electromagnetic sources to solve the problem of second harmonic generation . for simplicity ,",
    "in the following we will consider a beam modulated at a single frequency @xmath3 as the source .",
    "one may always write the longitudinal current density @xmath4 along the undulator as a sum of an unperturbed part independent of the modulation and of the time , @xmath5 , and a term responsible for the beam modulation , @xmath6 , at frequency @xmath3 ( perturbation ) :    @xmath7    we assume that we can write the unperturbed part @xmath5 as if all the particles where moving coherently , that is    @xmath8    where @xmath9 describes the coherent motion .",
    "this assumption is always verified , for instance , in the case of a single particle , when @xmath10 is simply a @xmath11-dirac function , or in the case of a monochromatic beam . if some energy spread is present , in order for eq .",
    "( [ unp ] ) to be valid we should assume that the transverse size of the electron beam is not smaller than the typical wiggling motion of the electrons .",
    "in this case , the validity of eq .",
    "( [ unp ] ) has an accuracy given by the relative deviation of the particles energy form the average value , @xmath12 . since for the fel process @xmath13 is , at most , of the order of the efficiency parameter , we have @xmath14 and eq .",
    "( [ unp ] ) is valid with the same accuracy of fel theory .",
    "however it should be noted here that the average energy of the beam is to be considered , in general , a function of the coordinate @xmath15 , @xmath16 : it has to be given as a result of start - to - end simulations and considered as an input for our electromagnetic problem .    the perturbation @xmath6",

    "it should be noted that the values of @xmath18 are not necessarily real : in fact there can be a @xmath15-dependent phase shift with respect to the phase @xmath19 .    in order to correctly calculate the phase @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ jzp ] ) one has to account for the dependence of the longitudinal velocity associated with the coherent motion , @xmath21 on the position @xmath15 .",
    "the function @xmath22 can be recovered from the knowledge of @xmath9 and of the average energy of the beam @xmath16 .",
    "if the beam is deflected of angles @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the horizontal and vertical direction with respect to the @xmath15 axis , the velocity of the coherent motion depends also on the deflection angles . renaming position and velocity of the coherent motion with no deflection with the subscript `` ( nd ) ''",
    "one obtains :    @xmath25    and    @xmath26    also @xmath18 will depend on @xmath27 .",
    "the exact dependence is fixed by the way the beam is prepared and should be regarded as a condition for the orientation of the microbunching wavefront . in all generality",

    "an important comment to what has been done before is needed .",
    "we calculated the electric field , the angular intensity distribution and the power for the second harmonic making a particular assumption about the electron beam modulation in eq .",

    "the same assumption has been implicitly done calculating the first harmonic power ( the expression in @xcite has been used , which does not account for deflection angles ) . in this particular case",
    "we have seen that the total power of the second harmonic radiation does not depend on the deflection angles @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the more general situation",
    "we find that the second harmonic power can be independent of the beam deflection angle ( like in the situation treated by us ) or can decrease due to the presence of extra oscillating factors in @xmath195 in eq .",
    "( [ undurad5 ] ) . on the contrary , in @xcite , an increase of the total power",
    "is reported due to the presence of deflection angles .",
    "after the presentation of our theory has been given , in this section we want to discuss in a more detailed way the differences between our approach and the currently accepted treatment of the problem of second harmonic generation .",
    "it is worth to begin summarizing the steps which led us to our main results .",
    "first , we started from the wave equation assuming that the electromagnetic sources are given externally by some code calculating the electron beam bunching at the second harmonic .",
    "second , after applying the ultrarelativistic approximation ( @xmath29 ) and the resonance approximation ( @xmath61 ) , both non - restrictive ones , we solved exactly the wave equation using the green s function method .",
    "third , we calculated the angular distribution of intensity assuming a given beam modulation and we derived an expression for the total power radiated at the second harmonic by integrating the expression for the angular distribution of intensity .",
    "finally we compared the expression for the second harmonic power with the analogous expression for the first harmonic .    in @xcite and later on in @xcite the ultrarelativistic and",
    "the resonance approximation were used too , but several steps were performed on the wave equation which we find incorrect .",
    "first , the gradient term in the source part of the wave equation is overlooked .",
    "second , the particles trajectory in the transverse @xmath100 direction is expanded ( we will comment on this later on ) , and because of that the fresnel number @xmath160 is not identified as the main physical parameter of the problem .",
    "third , after these manipulations , the wave equation is not solved but , rather , the second harmonic power is estimated in the following way : ( a ) the squared of the ( manipulated ) source parts of the wave equation for the second harmonic is calculated ; ( b ) the squared of the source parts for the first @xcite or the third @xcite harmonic is calculated ; ( c ) the ratio between the square of the source parts for the second and either the first @xcite or the third @xcite is taken . as a result ,",
    "magnitude of the second harmonic power and polarization characteristics are predicted that are in disagreement with what we have found . in @xcite ,",
    "further notions regarding the case of deflection angle between the beam and the undulator axis are introduced .",
    "we already expressed our critical view on this last conclusion at the end of the previous section .",
    "let us briefly comment on the other points mentioned above by analyzing more in detail the approach followed in @xcite .",
    "as has been already said , we find that neglecting the gradient term in the wave equation is not correct . as we have seen in section [ sec :",
    "ours ] such term is responsible for a contribution to the total intensity for the second harmonic both for the horizontal and for the vertical polarization components and , indeed , it can not be neglected .",
    "doing so would result in any case in an overall incomplete result : namely one would obtain only part of the horizontally polarized component of the field .",
    "going further with the derivation in @xcite , the motion of the electrons in the @xmath100-direction is written as a sum of a fast oscillation due to the undulating motion and a slow motion due to the betatron functions .",
    "on the @xmath102-direction instead , only the slow motion due to betatron functions is present .",
    "the beam distribution is then considered as a collection of individual point - particles , i.e. a sum of @xmath11-dirac functions . for",
    "the @xmath196-th electron one may write    @xmath197    and    @xmath198    where @xmath199 describes the fast oscillation , while @xmath200 and @xmath201 describe the slow motion .",
    "all the @xmath11-dirac in the @xmath100 coordinate on the right hand side of maxwell equation are subsequently expanded as    @xmath202    based on the only assumption that the transverse beam dimension is much larger than the wiggling amplitude of the electron motion .",
    "it should be noted that , based on this assumption , the ratio between the wiggling amplitude and the transverse beam dimensions , @xmath203 , is identified as the main physical parameter of the theory and is denoted as the coupling strength of the second harmonic emission . in contrast with this we have found that the exact solution of the wave equation depends on the fresnel number , but not on the coupling strength ( see , for instance , eq .",
    "( [ i2xybis ] ) ) . in this regard",
    "it is suggestive to write @xmath204 as @xmath205 ^ 2\\times \\pi n_w ( 2+k^2)/(4 k^2 ) $ ] .",
    "as @xmath206 assumes a fixed value ( for instance , much smaller than unity according to the assumption above ) , our fresnel number can assume any value , depending on the number of undulator periods @xmath207 .",
    "if , on the one hand , @xmath208 we have a behavior @xmath209 so that @xmath210 as has been seen in eq .",
    "( [ compxlim ] ) and therefore the ratio @xmath211 is independent on @xmath207 as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ realcomp ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath139 we obtain @xmath212 \\sim \\mathrm{const}$ ] so that @xmath213 is independent on @xmath207 while @xmath214 . on the contrary ,",
    "being based on the coupling strength parameter only , current understandings of the second harmonic mechanism predict that @xmath211 is always independent on @xmath207 .",
    "finally we find that , from a mathematical viewpoint , the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ expwrong ] ) constitutes an incorrect manipulation of the right hand side of maxwell equation and . to show this",
    ", we simply need to consider the mathematical structure of the wave equation .",
    "for any polarization component we are dealing with a differential equation :    @xmath215    with    @xmath216    where @xmath217 is a function containing the appropriate phase factor .",
    "this is essentially equivalent to our starting equation , eq .",
    "( [ incipit4 ] ) , the only differences being that the sources are presented in a different way and that , at that stage , we had already assumed that the transverse beam dimensions are not smaller than the wiggling amplitude of the electron motion .    the problem with the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ expwrong ] ) is that @xmath218 is a function of the longitudinal coordinate and that the green s function for the wave equation depends on both longitudinal and transverse coordinates .",
    "let us see this point in more detail .",
    "if we call with @xmath219 the green s function of the operator @xmath220 we have    @xmath221    that is    @xmath222    it follows that the expansion of the @xmath11-dirac in eq .",
    "( [ expwrong ] ) is mathematically equivalent to the expansion of the green s function @xmath223 in @xmath224 around @xmath225 ; however under the only assumptions @xmath226 and @xmath227 we can not expand the green s function in @xmath224 around @xmath228 .",
    "in fact we have that    @xmath229    because @xmath223 is simultaneously a function of @xmath15 not only through @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 but also through @xmath233 .",
    "in this paper we addressed the mechanism of second harmonic generation in free - electron lasers .",
    "we found that an early treatment of this phenomenon @xcite is based on arbitrary manipulations of the source term of the wave equation , which describes the electrodynamical part of the problem .",
    "first , an important part of the source term is neglected and , second , an expansion of the particles trajectory in the transverse horizontal direction is performed , while we find that there is no ground for such a step . moreover , this leads to the identification of the ratio between the amplitude of the electron wiggling motion in the ( planar ) undulator and the electron beam transverse size as the main physical parameter , while such parameter does not play any role in our theory .",
    "the same steps were also followed in @xcite .",
    "after these manipulations , the wave equation is not solved but , rather , an estimation of the second harmonic power is given by calculating the squared of the manipulated source parts in the wave equation for the second and either for the first @xcite or the third @xcite harmonic and , subsequently , taking the ratio between the squared of the second harmonic source part and either the squared of the first or the third .",
    "finally in @xcite it is introduced the notion of a second harmonic power increasing when a deflection angle between the beam trajectory and the undulator @xmath15 direction is present . on the contrary",
    ", we find that such power can only decrease or , at most , be independent of the deflection angle , depending on how the beam modulation is prepared . by solving analytically the wave equation with the help of the green s function technique we derived an exact expression for the field of the second harmonic emission .",
    "we limited ourselves to the steady - state case which is close to practice in high - gain harmonic generation ( hghg ) schemes but , for the rest , we did not make restrictive approximations .",
    "this solution of the wave equation may therefore be used as a basis for the development of numerical codes dealing with second harmonic emission , which should be using as input data the electron beam bunching for the second harmonic as calculated by self - consistent fel codes .",
    "we found that , in general , the second harmonic field presents both horizontal and vertical polarization components and that the electric field is linearly polarized , while the relative magnitude of the power associated to the vertical polarization component to that associated to the horizontal polarization component is a function of the undulator deflection parameter only . using our result we calculated analytically the directivity diagram and the power associated with the second harmonic radiation assuming a particular beam modulation case .",
    "we expect that these expressions may be useful for cross - checking of numerical results .    in this paper",
    ", we presented a theory of the second harmonic generation mechanism in xfels and pointed out several notions on such mechanism which we consider incorrect . in this regard",
    ", it should be noted that some of them appear to go beyond the subject of harmonic generation itself .",
    "in fact we have seen that these notions imply an increase of the second harmonic power when an angle between the beam direction and the undulator axis is present , as if this was a general property depending on maxwell equations .",
    "in other words , it looks like the solution of maxwell equations for any electron beam in an undulator would yield a non - trivial dependence on the angle between the trajectory and the undulator axis .",
    "if so , this conclusion should be valid , in particular , for a single particle as well .",
    "we find that this is not correct : in fact , for a single particle in a undulator the dependence of the electric field on the angle between the average direction of the particle and the undulator axis , @xmath234 , is simply related to the chosen reference system , i.e. , usually , one with the @xmath15 axis aligned with the undulator axis",
    ". a simple rotation of an angle @xmath234 to a system with the @xmath15 axis aligned with the electron average velocity would give a result independent on such angle .",
    "this means that the basic characteristics of undulator radiation , in particular the intensity distribution at fixed frequency and the spectrum at fixed observation angle @xmath103 , depend on the combination @xmath235 only . in other words",
    "the presence of an angle @xmath234 between the electron direction and the undulator axis has the only effect of introducing a rotation in the expression of the electric field otherwise leaving unvaried all its characteristics , including its resonance frequency .",
