    "extrapolation to the continuum limit is an indispensable procedure to obtain physics from lattice calculations . for the system including heavy quarks ( @xmath0 )",
    "this extrapolation might no longer be straightforward , since @xmath1 errors can uncontrollably be large . in this work",
    "we numerically explore the problem of the continuum limit for the decay constant of heavy - light mesons using the wilson heavy quark action in the quenched approximation .",
    "table  [ table : simulation_parameters ] summarizes parameters we used in our simulations carried out on vpp-500/80 at kek .",
    "the improvement we have made since lattice 95@xcite is the adoption of a smeared source for heavy quarks to suppress contaminations from excited states , and an addition of a run at @xmath2 .",
    "we use as a smearing function the wave function of heavy - light mesons as measured in the simulation .",
    "the size of lattice is chosen so that physical volume is roughly constant against @xmath3 .",
    "we take the physical scale of the lattice estimated from the charmonium spin - averaged 1s-1p mass splitting .         where we take the value with prescription ( iib ) for our central values .",
    "the first error is statistical and the second represents a spread over four prescriptions , which gives an estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "finally we emphasize that convergence of different extrapolations to the continuum limit both from above and below bolsters the reliability of our results , at least for charmed mesons .",
    "we expect that the errors for bottom mesons are at most within the quoted errors",
