    "the amplitudes of these radial velocity oscillations are less than a few hundred m s@xmath6 and no significant line - bisector variations are detected ( see section  [ sec : blends ] ) .",

    "the radius and mass estimates for wasp-2 are better constrained .",
    "we have also used the available bv and 2mass photometry to estimate @xmath28 using the infrared flux method @xcite , which gave results in agreement with that obtained from the spectral analysis .",
    "the formal precision of the radial - velocity observations depends on the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum , the sharpness and density of the stellar lines , and the scattered - light background in the instrument .",
    "the formal errors on the velocity measures are given by the semi - empirical estimator @xmath34/(s : n*contrast ) .",
    "the contrast parameter quantifies the contrast of the ccf peak against the additional background signal from light leakage into the as - yet incomplete spectrograph enclosure .",
    "because we did not use simultaneous thorium - argon wavelength calibration , the accuracy of the radial - velocity measurements is limited by the stability of the spectrograph over the 2 to 3 hours between successive thorium - argon calibration exposures , considering that its thermal control was not yet optimized .",
    "tests performed during the commissioning of the instrument indicate that the velocity drift during a night is typically in the range @xmath35 m s@xmath6 . taking into consideration additional uncertainties coming from the wavelength solution of the h.e .",

    "although the wavelength calibration may vary only slowly during a given night , the drifts may reasonably be expected to be uncorrelated from one night to the next .",
    "guiding noise should be uncorrelated even between successive observations .",

    "in modelling the superwasp photometry we used linear limb darkening coefficients @xmath74 and 0.63 @xcite for wasp-1 and wasp-2 respectively . for the more precise data from ofxb and volunteer observatory we used the 4-coefficient model of @xcite .",

    "an additional 50 m s@xmath6 was added in quadrature to the uncertainties of radial - velocity observations during transits , to allow for the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in spite of this , the contribution of the radial - velocity data to the total value of @xmath65 in both stars is larger than expected .",
    "wasp-1 yields a spectroscopic @xmath79 for 5 degrees of freedom , while wasp-2 gives @xmath80 for 7 degrees of freedom .",
    "more extensive observations will be required to establish the cause of this small additional `` jitter '' in the radial - velocity measurements .",
    "a common cause of such radial - velocity  jitter \" is rotationally - modulated distortion of the line profiles arising from magnetic activity in the stellar chromosphere and photosphere .",
    "while the s : n in the bluest orders of the sophie spectra is insufficient for us to measure the chromospheric emission cores in the ca ii hk lines in any meaningful way , both stars have narrow ccfs that suggest @xmath81 values less than @xmath82 km s@xmath6 and hence low to moderate activity levels .",
    "we allow for this additional variability in the bootstrap error analysis by adding 12 m s@xmath6 of additional radial - velocity jitter to the synthetic radial - velocity data .",
    "we note that this amount of jitter is within the ranges determined empirically for f and k stars with low to moderate levels of chromospheric activity @xcite , and conclude that chromospheric activity is a likely cause .    also given in table  [ tab : params ]",
    "are the masses and radii of wasp-1b and wasp-2b derived using the best - fit model parameters . despite the ambiguities in the light - curve solution",
    "it is clear that the data presented show that wasp-1 and wasp-2 have planetary - mass companions with gas - giant radii .",
    "although many types of stellar binary system can mimic a planet - like transit signal , most are easily eliminated .",
    "strong rotational broadening implies tidal synchronisation by a massive companion . grazing double or single - lined stellar binaries",
    "reveal their nature after one or two observations .",
    "triple systems can , however , mimic transiting planets in a way that is difficult to eliminate ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". a bright single f , g or k star with a much fainter , physically associated eclipsing - binary companion will apparently produce shallow eclipses .",
    "if the bright primary has narrow absorption lines , the faint binary s lines will produce apparent periodic velocity shifts in the combined spectrum , in phase with the photometric orbit .",
    "the apparent shift occurs because the broadened lines of the tidally - synchronised primary of the eclipsing binary are doppler shifted by orbital motions into the wings of the composite line profile .",
    "several tests can reveal this type of system .",
    "because the spectral types of the bright star and the cooler eclipsing binary are very different , cross - correlation masks of different spectral types tend to yield different orbital velocity amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we computed the ccf with different masks without significant change in the radial - velocity values .",
    "because the apparent doppler shift arises through a variable asymmetry in the line wings , line - bisector analysis of the cross - correlation function is also an effective probe for this type of system @xcite .",
    "when the fainter , moving spectrum is broadened by rotation , the induced velocity shift is sufficiently weak that the apparent velocity variation tends to be small unless the binary s lines are strong enough to give a clearly - visible asymmetry in the combined line profile .",
    "the change in line - bisector velocity from the wings to the core of the line tends to be greater than the induced velocity amplitude .",
    "we measured the asymmetries of the cross - correlation function peaks using the line - bisector method of @xcite . for wasp-1 and wasp-2",
    "we found the scatter in bisector velocities from the wings to the core of the ccf profile to be substantially less than the measured orbital velocity amplitude , and uncorrelated with orbital phase . a third candidate , 1swasp j210318.01 + 080117.8 , failed this test and was eliminated as a planet candidate .",
    "therefore , we can eliminate the scenario `` bright single star plus faint , late - type short - period eclipsing binary '' with confidence for wasp-1 and wasp-2 . while other more intricate scenarios are possible , we were not able to contrive any that could explain both the photometric and the velocity signals while remaining credible .    at the 380 and 140 pc distances of wasp-1 and wasp-2 , it should be possible to resolve such binary companions at separations of a few tens of au or more with the help of adaptive optics . as an additional line of defence against this type of astrophysical false positive , we secured high - resolution @xmath83-band images of both targets with the naomi adaptive - optics system on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope on the nights of 2006 september 6 and 7 . images with corrected fwhm = 0.25 arcsec",
    "reveal that wasp-1 has a * stellar * companion 4.7 arcsec to the north and 3.7 magnitudes fainter at @xmath83 .",
    "the sophie fibre aperture has a diameter of 3 arcsec . seeing and",
    "guiding errors may allow some of the companion s light into the fibre , but we can be fairly confident that the contamination is not significant at visible wavelengths . even if the companion were an eclipsing binary , it would be unlikely to mimic the radial - velocity signature of a planet , and indeed the line - bisector analysis eliminates this possibility .",
    "naomi h - band images taken on 2006 september 7 with corrected fwhm=0.2 arcsec , and using the osca coronagraph system , show that wasp-2 has a stellar companion 2.7 magnitudes fainter at @xmath83 located 0.7 \" to the east .",
    "this falls within the sophie fibre aperture .",
    "additional naomi images secured during transit on 2006 september 10 20:00 to 20:20 ut with 0.2 arcsec corrected fwhm showed no sign of the @xmath841.5-mag deep eclipse in the companion that would be needed to mimic a transit .",
    "future ao observations should reveal whether these faint stellar companions ( which are the only objects visible besides wasp-1 and wasp-2 in their respective naomi fields of view ) are chance alignments or common - proper - motion companions .",
    "we have detected the presence of radial - velocity variations in two exoplanetary transit candidates .",
    "our preliminary analysis yields masses between 0.8 and 1.0 @xmath85 for both planets . wasp-1b and wasp-2b lie between the  hot jupiters \" and the  very hot jupiters \" in the mass - orbital separation diagram for transiting hot jupiters , ( fig .",
