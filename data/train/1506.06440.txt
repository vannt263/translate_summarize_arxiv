    "the topology and regularity of the spheres as well as the dimension assumptions matter : the result obviously does not hold surfaces @xmath3 of positive genus . for codimension @xmath25 knots @xmath1 in a @xmath26-sphere @xmath3 , the complement is connected but not simply connected .",

    "his argument is similar to jordan s proof for @xmath33 using an intersection number is what we will follow here .",

    "its deepness in the case @xmath33 can be measured by the fact that ' ' 4000 instructions to the computer generate the proof of the jordan curve theorem \" @xcite .",
    "there are various proofs known of the jordan - brouwer theorem : it has been reduced to the brouwer fixed point theorem @xcite , proven using nonstandard analysis @xcite or dealt with using tools from complex analysis @xcite .",
    "alexander @xcite already used tools from algebraic topology and studied the cohomology of the complementary domains when dealing with embeddings of with finite cellular chains . in some sense , we follow here alexander s take on the theorem , but in the language of graph theory , language formed by a.v .",
    "evako in @xcite in the context of molecular spaces and digital topology .",
    "it is also influenced by discrete morse theory @xcite .",
    "when translating the theorem to the discrete , one has to specify what a  sphere \" and what an  embedding \" of a sphere in an other sphere is in graph theory .",
    "we also need notions of  intersection numbers \" of complementary spheres as well as workable notions of  homotopy deformations \" of spheres within an other sphere .",
    "once the definitions are in place , the proof can be done by induction with respect to the dimension @xmath2 .",
    "intersection numbers and the triviality of the fundamental group allow to show that the two components in the @xmath0-dimensional unit sphere of a vertex in @xmath3 lifts to two components in the @xmath2-dimensional case : to prove that there are two complementary components one has to verify that the intersection number of a closed curve with the @xmath0-sphere @xmath1 is even .",
    "this implies that if a curve from a point in @xmath21 to @xmath12 in the smaller dimensional case with intersection number @xmath23 is complemented to become a closed curve in @xmath3 , also the new connection from @xmath21 to @xmath12 has an odd intersection number , preventing the two regions to be the same .",

    "we will have to describe the homotopy on the regularized simplex level to regularizes things .",
    "the jordan - schoenflies theme is here used as a test bed for definitions in graph theory .",
    "indeed , we rely on ideas from @xcite .",
    "+ lets look at the jordan case , an embedding of a circle in a 2-sphere . a naive version of a discrete jordan theorem is the statement that a  simple closed curve in a discrete sphere divides the complement into two regions \" . as illustrated in figure  ( [ octahedron ] ) , this only holds with a grain of salt .",
    "take the octahedron graph @xmath3 and a closed hamiltonian path which visits all vertices , leaving no complement .",
    "it is even possible for any @xmath34 to construct a discrete sphere @xmath3 and a curve @xmath1 in @xmath3 such that the complement has @xmath35 components as the curve can bubble off regions by coming close to itself without intersecting itself but still dividing up a disk from the rest of the sphere .",
    "as usual with failures of discrete versions of continuum results , the culprit is the definition , in this case , it is the definition of an  embedding \" .",
    "the example of a hamiltonian path is more like a discrete peano curve in the continuum as it visits all vertices but without hitting all directions or area forms of the plane .",
    "we need to make sure that also the closure of the embedding is the same curve . in the graph theoretical case",
    ", we ask that the graph generated in @xmath3 by the vertex set of @xmath1 is still a sphere . for curves in a 2-sphere for example we have to ask that the embedded curve features no triples of vertices forming a triangle in @xmath3 .",
    "there is an other reinterpretation to make the theorem true for simple closed curves as we will see in the proof : there is a regularized picture on the simplex level , where two complementary domains always exist .",
    "we need the simplex regularization because embeddings do not play well with deformations : when making homotopy deformation steps , we in general lose the property of having an embedded sphere . already in discrete planar geometry ,",
    "where we work in the flat @xmath25-dimensional hexagonal lattice @xcite one has to invoke rather subtle definitions to get conditions which make things work .",
    "discrete topological properties very much depend on the definitions used .",
    "it would be possible to build a homotopy deformation process which honors the embeddability , but it could be complicated .",
    "the construction of a graph product @xcite provided us with an elegant resolution of the problem : we can watch the deformation of an  enhanced embedding \" @xmath36 in @xmath37 , where @xmath36 is the graph obtained from @xmath1 by taking all the complete subgraphs of @xmath1 as vertices and connecting two of them if one is a subgraph of the other .",
    "it turns out that even if @xmath1 is only a subgraph of @xmath3 , the graph @xmath36 is an embedding of @xmath37 .",
    "this holds in particular if @xmath1 is a hamiltonian path in @xmath3 , the closure of @xmath36 , the graph generated by the vertex set of @xmath36 remains geometric in @xmath37 .",
    "the cartesian product @xcite allows also to look at homotopy groups geometrically : a deformation of a curve in a @xmath25-sphere @xmath3 for example is now described as a geometric surface in the @xmath26-dimensional solid cylinder @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the @xmath23-dimensional line graph with @xmath40 vertices and @xmath41 edges .",
    "this is now close to the definition of homotopy of a curve using a function @xmath42 in two variables so that @xmath43 is the first curve and @xmath44 the second .",
    "+ this paper is not the first take on a discrete jordan theorem as various translations of the jordan theorem have been constructed to the discrete .",
    "they are all different from what we do here : @xcite uses notions of discrete geometry , @xcite looks at jordan surfaces in the geometry of digital spaces , @xcite proves a jordan - brouwer result in the discrete lattice @xmath45 , @xcite extends a result of steinhaus on a @xmath46 checkerboard @xmath3 , a minimal king - path @xmath1 connecting two not rook - adjacent elements of the boundary divides @xmath3 into two components .",
    "a variant of this on a hexagonal board @xcite uses such a result to prove the brouwer fixed point theorem in two dimensions .",
    "@xcite deals more generally with graphs which can have multiple connections .",
    "the result essentially establishes what we do in the special case @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite looks at two theorems in @xmath47 or @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the usual cartesian product and @xmath50 the tight product . in both cases ,",
    "the complement of @xmath51 has exactly two path components . the paper @xcite deals with graphs , for which every unit sphere @xmath10 is a hamiltonian graph .",
    "also here , a closed simple path @xmath51 in a connected planar graph @xmath3 divides the complement into exactly two components .",
    "@xcite deals with graphs which can have multiple connections . on @xmath25-spheres",
    ", it resembles the jordan case @xmath33 covered here as a special case .",
    "+ the main theorems given here could readily be derived from the continuum by building a smooth manifold from a graph , and then use the jordan - brouwer - schoenflies rsp .",
    "mazur - morse - brown theorem .",
    "the approach however is different as no continuum is involved : all definitions and steps are combinatorial and self - contained and could be accepted by a mathematician avoiding axioms invoking infinity .",
    "sometimes , constructabily can be a goal @xcite .",
    "new is that we can prove jordan - brouwer - schoenflies entirely within graph theory using a general inductive graph theoretical notion of  sphere \" @xcite .",
    "papers of jordan , brouwer or alexander show that the proofs in the continuum often deal with a combinatorial part only and then use an approximation argument to get the general case . as the alexander horned sphere , the open schoenfliess conjecture or questions about triangulations related to the hauptvermutung show , the approximation part can be difficult within topology and we do nt go into it .",
    "our proof remains discrete but essentially follows the arguments from the continuum by defining intersection numbers and use induction with respect to dimension .",
    "the induction proof is possible because of the recursive definition of spheres and seems not have been used in the continuum , nor in discrete geometry or graph theory . but what really makes the theorem go , is to watch the story on the simplex level , where geometric graphs @xmath3 remain geometric and where sub - spheres @xmath1 of @xmath3 can be watched as embedded spheres @xmath36 in @xmath37 .",
    "the step @xmath52 can be used in the theory of triangulations because it has a  regularizing effect \" .",
