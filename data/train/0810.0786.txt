    "in a series of papers , gabriel f. calvo , antonio picn , and co - authors studied the manipulation of single - photon states for purposes of quantum communication , from theory to experimental design @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated the limitations of the metaplectic operators when acting on spatial transverse - field modes , and they showed how one can overcome those limitations with a different family of transformations @xcite . in particular , they considered the subspace of states spanned by the three lowest hermite - gaussian ( transverse spatial ) modes @xmath0 and found a class of operators that would allow arbitrary manipulations of such modes .",
    "however , their class of operators includes `` non - gaussian transformations '' , which are not metaplectic operators .",
    "thus the question arises of what properties of metaplectic operators may be extended , at least partially , to their non - gaussian transformations .",
    "this could lead to the construction of the associated optical system @xcite .",
    "the theory of metaplectic operators is often presented in terms of the stone - von neumann theorem ( see , for example , the book of g. b. folland @xcite ) . rather than attempt to extend the stone - von neumann theorem to non - gaussian transformations , in this paper we provide an alternative approach , based on the theory of semiclassical fourier integral operators .",
    "we find that a fourier integral operator ansatz provides approximate solutions to the evolution equations of calvo and picn , and in the process we will determine the canonical transformations associated with the non - gaussian transformations , in the sense of egorov s theorem .",
    "in fact , the canonical transformations are given by the hamilton flow of the semiclassical weyl symbols of calvo and picn s [ now semiclassical ] differential operators .",
    "the weyl symbols are dependent on the semiclassical parameter @xmath1 , so the hamilton flow is also @xmath1-dependent .",
    "we take this point of view essentially for three reasons : ( 1 ) the operators may be exactly reconstructed from their ( @xmath1-dependent ) weyl symbols .",
    "( 2 ) the flow leaves invariant a disc of radius @xmath2 , which closes up as @xmath3 . in the context of laser physics , @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the radius of the laser beam s waist . outside this disc of radius @xmath6",
    ", the flow goes to infinity in finite time .",
    "this is because the flow propagates along elliptic curves having two components , one bounded and one unbounded .",
    "( see section [ s : fionongauss ] and the appendix . ) and ( 3 ) the appropriate version of egorov s theorem has an error of order @xmath7 , rather than the more typical @xmath8 .",
    "( see section [ s : egorov ] . ) moreover , in section [ s : concl ] we give examples suggesting that we have creation and propagation of singularities along the @xmath1-dependent flow .    in this paper",
    "we find that there are fundamental difficulties with the generators of the non - gaussian transformations .",
    "first of all , we show that , although they are clearly symmetric , they have infinite deficiency indices .",
    "we are however able to describe all self - adjoint realizations in terms of certain boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "and there are difficulties with constructing semiclassical approximations of the unitary groups ( the non - gaussian transformations ) .",
    "we can still find approximate solutions to the evolution equations , but the associated symplectic transformations can blow up in finite time , as they are described in terms of the weierstrass @xmath9-function , which , as is well - known , has a double pole in every period . however , we show that the semiclassical propagator behaves reasonably well when acting on sufficiently phase - space localized initial conditions , for example , finite sums of semiclassical hermite - gaussian modes .",
    "this is because , as mentioned above , the hamilton flow leaves invariant a disc of radius @xmath2 centered at the origin .    in section  [",
    "s : calvopiconreview ] we review the non - gaussian transformations of calvo and picn and show that the generators have infinite deficiency indices .",
    "we then describe all self - adjoint realizations in terms of certain boundary conditions at infinity . in section  [ s : scformalism ]",
    "we introduce the semiclassical version of calvo and picn s work , so that we can solve their evolution equations approximately , in the semiclassical regime .",
    "we illustrate this method in sections [ s : warmup ] and [ s : gyrator ] by first taking simpler generators and using semiclassical fourier integral operators to find _ exact _ solutions to the associated evolution equations , corresponding to `` gaussian transformations '' .",
    "we use the same method for the more difficult non - gaussian transformations in sections [ s : fionongauss ] and [ s : tilt4 ] , but in that case we only have approximate solutions to the evolution equations . in section [ s : egorov ]",
    "we discuss egorov s theorem and give a property of non - gaussian transformations that is analogous to a property of metaplectic transformations .",
    "we give concluding remarks in section [ s : concl ] , and we include an appendix for relevant facts regarding elliptic curves .",
    "+ * notation : * we write @xmath10 and similarly for the other variables .",
    "also , we will use the semiclassical weyl quantization of a symbol @xmath11 , defined by @xmath12 we will mostly be in dimension @xmath13 or @xmath14 , and we will mostly deal with polynomials @xmath11 ( hence resulting in semiclassical differential operators with polynomial coefficients ) .",
    "in this section we recapitulate the recent work of calvo and picn @xcite .",
    "they introduced the following eight generators acting on hermite - gaussian modes : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22,\\ ] ] defined in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , and similarly for the @xmath25-variable .",
    "we note first of all that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are unitarily related by the fourier transform @xmath28 : @xmath29 and that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are obtained from @xmath26 and @xmath27 by simply interchanging the variables @xmath32 and @xmath25 .    these generators , within the subspace generated by the lowest three hermite - gaussian modes @xmath33 ,",
    "obey the @xmath34 algebra , which is only relevant here for @xmath35 and @xmath36 . ]",
    "@xmath37=if_{abc}{\\hat{\\mathcal{t}}}_{c}\\ ] ] ( @xmath38 ) , where the only nonvanishing ( up to permutations ) structure constants @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 we note that the triad of generators @xmath41 gives a @xmath42 group that conserves the mode order .",
    "the remaining two @xmath42 groups are formed by the triads @xmath43 and @xmath44 unitary operators @xmath45 generated by the first triad give rise to superpositions between the two modes @xmath46 and @xmath47 , leaving invariant the fundamental mode @xmath48 .",
    "unitarities @xmath49 and @xmath50 , generated by the second and third triad , produce superpositions between the two modes @xmath48 and @xmath46 ( leaving invariant @xmath47 ) , or the modes @xmath48 and @xmath47 ( leaving invariant @xmath46 ) , respectively . for reference , we state the operations for @xmath49 : @xmath51 the corresponding operations for @xmath45 and @xmath50 are similar .",
    "however , a difficulty arises when attempting to extend to larger subspaces of @xmath52 : starting from the smallest natural domain , the domain of [ finite ] linear combinations of hermite - gaussian modes , the symmetric operators @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 all have multiple self - adjoint realizations .",
    "we first prove that the deficiency indices of @xmath26 are both infinity .",
    "for this we consider how @xmath26 acts on the basis of two - dimensional hermite - gaussian modes , which we write either as @xmath53 or as @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being the mode order in the @xmath32-variable and @xmath56 being the mode order in the @xmath25-variable .",
    "we have that @xmath57 where @xmath58    we take the domain of @xmath26 ( as an unbounded linear operator ) to be the subspace @xmath59 of [ finite ] linear combinations of hermite - gaussian modes .",
    "this domain is dense in @xmath52 , and @xmath26 is clearly symmetric with this domain . and",
    "it is easy to check that the domain of the adjoint operator is @xmath60 and that , for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and we occasionally find it convenient to use the formal operator on sequences given by @xmath63    two somewhat degenerate cases occur when @xmath64 and @xmath13 , so we treat these separately . for @xmath64 ,",
    "we get @xmath65 and for @xmath13 , we get @xmath66 in all other cases we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 for all @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "hence @xmath26 acts like a jacobi matrix for any fixed @xmath56 , fixing the mode order in the @xmath25-variable , and @xmath26 may be decomposed accordingly . to be precise ,",
    "we consider the orthogonal projection operator onto the @xmath69 mode in @xmath25 : @xmath70 then ( [ e : caltonmn ] ) shows that @xmath26 is decomposed according to @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are by definition the kernels of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "that is , we have ( see , for example , the book of kato @xcite ) @xmath76    now , to prove that @xmath26 is not essentially self - adjoint on @xmath59 , for any fixed @xmath56 we consider the equations @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "this is a recursion relation for @xmath79 in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the special case",
    "when @xmath64 we simply take @xmath82 ; then the solution is uniquely determined by the initial value @xmath83 . if @xmath13 we simply take @xmath84=0 , so that the solution is uniquely determined by the initial value @xmath85 . in all other cases the solution is completely determined by @xmath86 and the initial value @xmath84 .",
    "hence @xmath80 is the initial condition multiplied by a polynomial in @xmath87 , which we write as @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath89 and denote by @xmath90 the orthogonal complement of @xmath91 , called the deficiency subspace of the operator @xmath26 .",
    "this subspace is precisely the subspace of solutions of the equation @xmath92 considering @xmath93 , stated in ( [ e : domadj ] ) , we see that @xmath90 is the subspace given by solutions of the difference equation @xmath94 ( or the appropriate modified version for @xmath64 and @xmath13 . for the remainder",
    "we always write the initial condition as @xmath84 , for convenience ) .",
    "hence for fixed @xmath56 the deficiency subspace is at most one - dimensional ; moreover , it is nonzero if and only if @xmath95 that is , if @xmath96 non - self - adjointness is then a consequence of the following theorem about the infinite jacobi matrix @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 for all @xmath100",
    ". we can reduce to this case if we multiply @xmath26 by @xmath101 .",
    "this theorem is from berezanskii s book ( @xcite , p.507 ) , where one may find a beautiful and elementary proof .",
    "[ t : berez ] assume that @xmath102 ( j=0,1 ,  ) , @xmath103 beginning with some @xmath100 , and @xmath104 then the operator @xmath105 is not self - adjoint .",
    "it is elementary to show that the hypotheses are satisfied for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , for any fixed @xmath56 .",
    "hence for any fixed @xmath56 the deficiency indices of the resulting jacobi matrix are both @xmath108 , and so , summing over @xmath56 , the deficiency indices for @xmath26 are both infinity .    as for the operator @xmath27 , we may either use a slight modification of the above methods , or we may simply use the fact that the fourier transform intertwines @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "then , simply by interchanging the roles of the variables @xmath32 and @xmath25 , we see that the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 also have infinite deficiency indices .",
    "the symmetric cubic operators @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 and @xmath30 of calvo and picn do however admit self - adjoint extensions .",
    "moreover , using the results of allahverdiev @xcite we may explicitly classify all of the self - adjoint extensions in terms of certain boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "we begin by studying the restriction of @xmath26 to the subspace @xmath72 given by the projection @xmath75 as in ( [ e : pnproj ] ) .",
    "we simplify notation by then omitting `` @xmath56 '' ; in particular , @xmath109 now denotes the @xmath110 hermite - gaussian mode , and @xmath111 will also lose the superscript `` @xmath56 '' .    for @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "we denote by @xmath114 $ ] the sequence with components @xmath114_{m}$ ] given by @xmath115_{m}=\\beta_{m}(g_{m}\\overline{h}_{m+1}-g_{m+1}\\overline{h}_{m}).\\ ] ] we then have green s formula : @xmath116_{m}\\ ] ] since the sequences @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 are all in @xmath121 , we then have that the limit @xmath115_{\\infty}=\\lim_{m\\rightarrow\\infty}[g , h]_{m}\\ ] ] exists and is finite .",

    "we have that @xmath126 ; in fact , @xmath127    with this set - up we have the following results of allahverdiev @xcite :    [ t : allaclos]*_(allahverdiev @xcite . )",

    "conversely , for an arbitrary @xmath137 , the boundary condition ( [ e : boundcond ] ) determines a self - adjoint extension on @xmath72 .",
    "allahverdiev @xcite additionally considers maximal dissipative and accretive extensions of infinite jacobi matrices .",
    "these correspond to @xmath140 such that @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "he also gives applications to scattering theory .",
    "it remains to consider @xmath26 as acting on the entire space @xmath143 let @xmath144 denote the restriction of @xmath26 to @xmath72 , that is , the operator in @xmath72 with @xmath145 such that @xmath146 .",
    "as we have just shown , the closure of @xmath144 is obtained by extending to the space of @xmath147 satisfying @xmath148 .",
    "we now prove the analogous result for the larger space .",
    "[ t : t4closure ] the closure of @xmath26 is obtained by extending to the space @xmath149    the closure of @xmath26 is of course the adjoint of @xmath150 , so we are to show that @xmath151 is equal to @xmath152 moreover , we note that @xmath153 since @xmath154 and @xmath26 have the same adjoint and since @xmath154 is automatically symmetric .",

    "we have also seen that self - adjoint extensions of @xmath144 are in one - to - one correspondence with boundary conditions of the form @xmath170 for @xmath171 .",
    "now we define @xmath172 and we denote the extension of @xmath26 to this domain as @xmath134 .",
    "we next show that all self - adjoint extensions of @xmath26 are of this form .",

    "conversely , for an arbitrary sequence @xmath173 with @xmath171 , the set @xmath177 determines a self - adjoint extension of @xmath26 .",
    "we begin by proving the converse : we take an arbitrary sequence @xmath1 with @xmath171 and prove that the extension @xmath134 to the domain @xmath177 is self - adjoint .",
    "we first show that @xmath177 is symmetric , that is , we show that @xmath178 as in the proof of theorem [ t : t4closure ] , we use the identity @xmath179_{\\infty}^{n}=\\langle g|{\\hat{\\mathcal{t}}}_{4}^{*}f\\rangle-\\langle{\\hat{\\mathcal{t}}}_{4}^{*}g|f\\rangle.\\ ] ] but now we may use the identity @xmath180_{m}^{n}=[g , u^{n}]_{m}^{n}[\\overline{f},v^{n}]_{m}^{n}-[g , v^{n}]_{m}^{n}[\\overline{f},u^{n}]_{m}^{n},\\ ] ] where @xmath181 and @xmath182 are the functions occurring in the definitions of @xmath183 and @xmath184 . hence , in the limit , @xmath180_{\\infty}^{n}=(\\gamma_{2}^{n}p_{n}g)(\\gamma_{1}^{n}p_{n}\\overline{f})-(\\gamma_{1}^{n}p_{n}g)(\\gamma_{2}^{n}p_{n}\\overline{f}).\\ ] ] since @xmath185 are in @xmath177 , we can use the identities @xmath186 and @xmath187 to see that @xmath188_{\\infty}^{n}=0 $ ] for all @xmath56 . hence @xmath134 is a symmetric operator .    to show that @xmath134 is a closed operator , we suppose that @xmath189 and @xmath190 then clearly , for all @xmath56 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 but since @xmath193 , the restriction of @xmath134 to @xmath72 , is closed ( as is @xmath150 ) , we then have that @xmath194 ( hence @xmath195 ) and that @xmath196 ( hence @xmath197 ) . so @xmath134 is a closed operator .",
    "next we show that the deficiency indices of @xmath134 are both zero .",

    "then @xmath200 , and , since @xmath193 is self - adjoint , @xmath201 for all @xmath56 .",
    "hence @xmath202 .",
    "so the deficiency indices of @xmath134 are both zero , and @xmath134 is a closed operator .",
    "hence @xmath134 is self - adjoint .    for the other direction ,",
    "let @xmath203 , with domain @xmath204 , be some self - adjoint extension of @xmath26 , and let @xmath205 be its restriction to @xmath72 . to show that @xmath205 is closed",

    "now @xmath205 is a self - adjoint extension of @xmath144 , so the results of allahverdiev cited above show that @xmath205 must be given by a boundary condition of the form @xmath170 for some @xmath171 .",
    "hence we have @xmath212 , that is , @xmath213 and since both operators are self - adjoint , we then have @xmath214 .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "we have now categorized all self - adjoint extensions of the operator @xmath26 , so we are presented with the basic question : which is the `` right '' extension ?",
    "we expect the physics of the problem to dictate the appropriate extension , for which we may return to the original work of calvo and picn @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "they state that the cubic generators , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , can be implemented with passive optical elements having higher - than - first - order aberrations ( nonquadratic refractive surfaces ) @xcite .",
    "perhaps the physics of the apparatus will determine the `` right '' self - adjoint extension .",
    "in the case of gaussian transformations , one may use the theory of metaplectic operators ( sometimes presented in terms of the stone - von neumann theorem ) to deduce the underlying canonical transformations .",
    "however , non - gaussian transformations are not metaplectic operators , so the arguments must be modified .",
    "calvo and picn then ask if the stone - von neumann theorem can be extended to the case of the above cubic generators , for then `` this would enable one to find the explicit form of the symplectic transform and thus the construction of the associated optical system '' @xcite . in the following sections we take a different approach : we approximate the non - gaussian transformations by semiclassical fourier integral operators , by starting with the semiclassical fourier integral operator ansatz and then by solving the resulting eikonal equation and transport equations .",
    "this , along with egorov s theorem ( stated in section [ s : egorov ] ) , justifies the claim that the underlying canonical transformation is the hamilton flow associated to the evolution equation . as a first step , in this section we put the work of calvo and picn in the framework of semiclassical analysis .",

    "it is more convenient to introduce the semiclassical differential operator @xmath221 for reference , we note that @xmath222 and we note that the semiclassical weyl symbol of @xmath223 is @xmath224 we then have the permutation properties similar to those in section [ s : calvopiconreview ] .",
    "explicitly , for @xmath49 we have @xmath225 the operations for @xmath45 and @xmath50 are similar .",
    "hence , in this choice of scale , we have permutations of the three lowest hermite - gaussian modes when @xmath226",
    "for non - gaussian transformations , the approximate representation by fourier integral operators will be somewhat complicated , so we begin with a simpler situation : the case of a gaussian transformation . for the sake of concreteness , we restrict our attention to the semiclassical differential operator @xmath227 though all ten generators of @xmath228 , the metaplectic representation of @xmath229 ( see @xcite ) , may be treated in the same way .",
    "our goal is then to solve the evolution equation @xmath230    following the method outlined in the book of grigis and sjstrand ( @xcite , p.129 ) , we try @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a quadratic form in @xmath233 . here",
