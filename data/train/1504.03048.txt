    "throughout this paper , let @xmath0 be an odd prime . denote by @xmath3 a finite field with @xmath0 elements .",

    "therefore , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the monic polynomial of lowest degree and divides @xmath15 . then @xmath14 is called the generator polynomial and @xmath16 is called the parity - check polynomial @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the number of codewords with hamming weight @xmath18 in a linear code @xmath5 of length @xmath11 .",
    "the weight enumerator of @xmath5 is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the sequence @xmath21 is called the weight distribution of the code @xmath5 .",
    "cyclic codes have found wide applications in cryptography , error correction , association schemes and network coding due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms . however , there are still many open problems in coding theory ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "it is an interesting subject to study the weight distribution of a linear code .",
    "firstly , the information of the error correcting capability of a code is achieved from the weight distribution , i.e. , the minimum distance @xmath8 is the minimum positive integer @xmath18 such that @xmath22 .",
    "secondly , the weight distribution of a cyclic code is closely related to the lower bound on the cardinality of a set of nonintersecting linear codes , which can be applied to prove the existence of resilient functions with high nonlinearity ( see theorem 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "finally , cyclic codes with few weights have found interesting applications in cryptography @xcite .",
    "therefore , the weight distribution is the major basis of computing the error probability of error detection and correction , and it is the primary tool of researching the structure of a code , improving the inner relationship of codewords for finding a new good code .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite given by ding @xmath23 for details on constructing optimal or almost optimal cyclic codes in the sense that they meet some bounds on linear codes .    in recent years",
    ", much attention has been paid to evaluating the weight distribution of cyclic codes though it is usually an extremely difficult problem .",
    "however , they are known only in a few special cases . for example",
    ", the authors in @xcite studied the weight distributions of irreducible cyclic codes . for reducible cyclic codes , the authors in @xcite settled the weight distributions of cyclic codes whose duals have two zeros .",
    "the authors of @xcite dealt with a few classes of cyclic codes whose duals have three zeros .",
    "as for cyclic codes whose duals have arbitrary zeros , see @xcite or @xcite for example .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be two positive integers with @xmath26 .",

    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the minimal polynomials of @xmath31 and @xmath32 over @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "obviously , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are pairwise distinct and @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , it can be easily shown that @xmath34 if @xmath35 and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be two cyclic codes over @xmath3 of length @xmath38 with parity - check polynomials @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "hence , the dimensions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 over @xmath3 are @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , if @xmath35 ; and otherwise , the dimensions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the greatest common divisor of @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "take @xmath46 .",
    "note that the cyclic code @xmath36 was defined by carlet , ding and yuan in @xcite and a tight lower bound on the minimum distance was also determined .",
    "later , the authors in @xcite established the weight distribution of @xmath36 for odd @xmath47 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no information about the weight distribution of @xmath36 in the case of even @xmath47 .    in this paper",
    ", we explicitly determine the weight distribution of the code @xmath36 for even @xmath47 and the weight distribution of the code @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the results show that both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are cyclic codes with few weights .",
    "in fact , the number of nonzero weights of these codes is no more than @xmath48 .",
    "this means that the two classes of cyclic codes may be of use in cryptography @xcite and secret sharing schemes @xcite .",
