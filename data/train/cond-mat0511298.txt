    "the elementary excitations above the ground state are + ( i ) fermionic , @xmath4 , bogoliubov quasiparticles , + ( _ ii _ ) plasmons ( or `` phase fluctuations '' ) , and + ( _ iii _ ) vortices with magnetic flux @xmath5 .    for the traditional `` low temperature '' superconductors , the vortices are usually treated as a classical , configuration of the superconducting order parameter , which forms a background for the quantum fluctuations of the fermionic quasiparticles and the cooper pairs : the quantum zero - point motion of the vortices themselves is negligibly small .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the vortices are expected to play a more fundamental role in the cuprate superconductors , requiring that the vortices be treated as bona fide quasiparticles and elementary excitations in their own right .",
    "there are a variety of experimental indications @xcite that the superconducting state is proximate to an insulating ground state",
    ". vortices and anti - vortices are expected to proliferate in the vicinity of such a transition , and so the energy gap towards creation of vortex / anti - vortex pairs in the superconductor becomes vanishingly small as the superconductor - insulator transition is approached .",
    "moreover , the superconductor coherence length , @xmath6 , is at most a few lattice spacings , which suggests that the effective mass of the vortices is small",
    ".    scales of a vortex .",
    "the core size is of the order of superconducting coherence length @xmath6 , while the extent of supercurrent circulations is roughly equal to the much larger london penetration depth @xmath7 .",

    "if we neglect the fermionic @xmath4 quasiparticles , the required action can be readily deduced from the theory of boson - vortex duality@xcite , as we will review below .",
    "we will primarily be concerned here on the influence of the gapless , nodal , fermionic quasiparticles on the vortices .",
    "the interaction between the fermions and the vortices is non - local , with no natural expansion parameter , and so its description poses a strong - coupling problem . here",
    ", we will consider a single , isolated , slowly moving vortex , and exactly evaluate the functional integral over the fermionic degrees of freedom by a combination of analytic and numerical techniques ; this yields a renormalization of the effective action for the vortices and the plasmons .",
    "our primary result will be that despite the absence of an energy gap in the fermionic spectrum , the influence of the fermionic degrees of freedom is relatively innocuous , and at zero temperature ( @xmath1 ) the leading terms in the vortex action retain the form deduced while ignoring the fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "the interplay between fermions and moving vortices has also been examined previously in semiclassical framework by a number of workers.@xcite these theories are expansion in the ratio of the superconducting pairing energy to the fermi energy , a ratio which is not small in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "we will not make any assumptions on the value of this ratio in the present paper .",
    "the results of semiclassical theory are expressed in a different framework of transport equations , and this makes direct comparison with our results difficult .",
    "an important characteristic of the semiclassical results is that the effective mass of a vortex ( as defined in their transport equations ) in a @xmath0-wave superconductor diverges linearly with the spacing between vortices .",
    "we do not find any corresponding divergence in the vortex mass in our functional formalism .",
    "the reasons for this potential discrepancy between our and the semiclassical results are not completely clear to us .",
    "we speculate it may be due to the breakdown of the semiclassical approximation in describing the low energy nodal fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "such fermionic excitations are not semiclassical , but , with their scale - invariant dirac spectrum , better characterized as a quantum - critical system.@xcite      it is worth pointing out here a noteworthy aspect of the action for vortices and plasmons presented here in eqs .",
    "( [ sv ] ) and ( [ sa ] ) .",
    "although obtained by an approximate and uncontrolled boson - vortex duality mapping , most of the coupling constants in the final action can be fixed rather precisely .",
    "the primary unknown is the vortex mass , @xmath37 , and we will describe microscopic contributions to its value this paper .    clearly , the physics described by @xmath38 is similar to the quantum electrodynamics of a charged particle .",
    "the coupling to the phase fluctuations will renormalize the vortex mass , @xmath37 , and lead to ` radiation damping ' in the motion of a vortex .",
    "we review this physics in section  [ sec : dynamic ] . for a neutral superfluid ,",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the phase fluctuations lead to a logarithmically divergent `` dynamic mass '' of the vortex ; we show how the analog of this result obtains in our formalism in section  [ sec : dynamic ] .",

    "( for completeness , we note that in a neutral @xmath0-wave superfluid , as we will demonstrate in section  [ sec : dynamic ] , there is an additional @xmath56 term in @xmath45 : this term is the manifestation , in the present formalism , of the logarithmically divergent `` dynamic mass '' of the vortex @xcite , noted above . )    it is interesting to note here that the expression for @xmath45 in eq .",

    "the dependence of @xmath63 on the velocities follows from ensuring consistency with engineering dimensions .",

    "our results show that any bardeen - stephen damping must come from other sources : a non - zero @xmath1 , or from impurities which induce a non - zero density of fermionic states at zero energy .",
    "in particular , we show in section  [ ssecfinitet ] that at @xmath2 , the function @xmath69 contains a bardeen - stephen term @xmath70 where the viscous drag co - efficient is universal in the clean limit : @xmath71 with @xmath72 a universal function of the velocity ratio .",
    "we are able to compute one contribution to @xmath73 exactly : that due to the statistical phase factor acquired by the fermions upon encircling the vortex  the result appears in eq .",

    "the nature of the coupling between the fermionic quasiparticles and the vortices and the plasmons will then be reviewed in section  [ sechamiltonian ] ; here we will follow the framework of teanovi and others.@xcite    with the basic formalism in place , it then remains to explicitly evaluate the functional determinant of the nodal fermions .",
    "there is no natural small parameter in this determinant , and so an exact evaluation is required .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to examine the structure of the perturbation theory order - by - order in the non - linearities ; this will be done in section  [ sec : perturbation ] .",

    "this section takes a slight detour .",
    "we will review earlier computations on the influence of phase fluctuations on the vortex mass .",
    "consideration of the influence of nodal quasiparticles will begin in section  [ secvortexaction ] .",
    "popov@xcite and duan@xcite have argued that vortices acquire a `` dynamic '' mass from their coupling to quantum fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting order , and that this contribution diverges logarithmically for a neutral superfluid .",
    "we now present the analog of this effect in our formalism , and show further that the divergence is absent in charged superfluids .",
    "we begin with a discussion of neutral superfluids . for this case , in the action for the phase fluctuations in eq .",

    "we begin by deriving a general effective action for a single vortex.@xcite we will focus on the contributions of the fermionic quasiparticles , with the aim of renormalizing the action @xmath92 presented in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "the vortex will be treated as a singular configuration of external gauge and supercurrent fields in the quasiparticle hamiltonian .",
    "we write a path - integral for quasiparticles and immediately integrate them out , which gives us the vortex action as a functional of the time - dependent vortex location .",
    "this is done in an expansion in the vortex velocity .",
    "formally , for this procedure to be well defined , quasiparticles must be massive .",
    "therefore , we will initially give a finite mass to the nodal quasiparticles , and send it to zero later when it becomes safe .",

    "there are four flavors of nodal quasiparticles - their contributions must be calculated separately and added to the vortex action .",
    "the quasiparticle hamiltonian @xmath96 , which we discuss in the next section , depends on the vortex position @xmath97 .",
    "we expand it to the second order in small vortex displacements from the origin : @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",

    "clearly , the vortex dynamics can be derived entirely from the knowledge of quasiparticle energies and wavefunctions in presence of the vortex at rest .",
    "the second term of  ( [ vact2 ] ) expanded to the second order in vortex position is : @xmath109 in absence of disorder , translational symmetry requires that there be no linear terms in @xmath97 in the vortex action .",

    "note that in the last expression @xmath30 already describes vortex motion - it is a `` bosonic '' matsubara frequency , taking values @xmath117 at finite temperatures .",
    "this expression is not zero at @xmath118 , which implies its non - invariance under translations , even in absence of disorder .",
    "however , the trapping potential encountered earlier can now be exactly cancelled .",
    "a simple recipe , which is rigorously derived in appendix [ appvortexaction ] , is to subtract from  ( [ trace3b ] ) its zero - frequency part . this way we obtain the complete effective vortex action : @xmath119    the vortex action must be invariant under all lattice symmetries of the superconducting material .",
    "translational symmetry is already guaranteed , while the @xmath120 degree rotation symmetry of the square lattice is implemented only after the contributions from all quasiparticle nodes are included .",
    "symmetry under @xmath120 rotations generates the same requirements on the vortex action at the second order in vortex displacement as the symmetry under any rotation .",
    "the allowed rotationally invariant terms are therefore @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and we may write the action as : @xmath123 the first term describes vortex mass and dissipation , while the second term breaks the time - reversal symmetry and describes possible magnus - type forces on the vortex arising from presence of quasiparticles .",
    "in this section we derive a convenient linearized form of the quasiparticle hamiltonian that will be used to find the effective vortex action . while our focus will be the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) description of quasiparticles , we note that similar results can also be obtained from the `` staggered - flux '' model of quasiparticles in @xmath0-wave superconductors .",

    "in such circumstances one can neglect contribution of the gauge field to the total flux of @xmath142 on @xmath136 and @xmath137 sublattices and keep only the @xmath143 contribution of the superfluid order parameter .",

    "we assume that all of the flux is contained in a small cylindrical shell : this yields @xmath181 for a vortex , and @xmath182 for an anti - vortex @xcite .",
    "other choices do not introduce qualitative changes in the results that follow , but they may give rise to some quantitative corrections , to the vortex mass for example , which we briefly discuss in the appendix [ apptheta ] .",
    "the presence of a vortex significantly affects quantum motion of quasiparticles , as is clearly seen from the local density of states ( ldos ) expressed in the rescaled coordinates ( for @xmath165 ) : @xmath183            \\frac{|\\epsilon|}{2\\pi } & |\\epsilon|r \\gg 1         \\end{array } \\right\\rbrace   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at small distances from the vortex core ldos diverges as @xmath155 due to the zero angular momentum state  ( [ wf0 ] ) , and there are also certain oscillations .",
    "this behavior was studied earlier , and with addition of the doppler shift it only acquires anisotropy , but does not qualitatively deviate from @xmath155 dependence @xcite . in realistic circumstances this divergence is cut - off by the finite core size .",
    "note that the ldos peak at @xmath184 does not correspond to bound states in purely @xmath0-wave vortex cores ( bound states could emerge only if a secondary order parameter , such as s - wave , were present in vicinity of the vortex ) .",
    "in fact , a careful analysis shows that the hamiltonian  ( [ hnodoppler ] ) does not support even a bound state exactly at @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "far away from the vortex core ldos becomes constant and linear in energy as expected .",
    "we can now calculate the matrix elements @xmath157 in  ( [ umatrel ] ) .",
    "this calculation can be done directly in the rescaled coordinate system , with the states  ( [ wf ] ) and  ( [ wf0 ] ) that were obtained after a gauge transformation , rescaling and a unitary transformation : @xmath186 here @xmath187 denotes @xmath188 .    the calculation of  ( [ u2 ] ) is pretty tedious , so that we only sketch it in the appendix [ appumatrel ] .",
    "a closed form for arbitrary quasiparticle mass @xmath164 is obtained by algebraic manipulations and elementary integrations , with help of bessel function identities .",
    "it turns out that no singularities are introduced in the end by taking the @xmath189 limit , so that in the following we will consider only the case of interest @xmath165 .",
    "since @xmath190 are essentially transition matrix elements of the momentum operator , the only allowed transitions are between states whose angular momentum is different by one . defining @xmath191 , we obtain for the node @xmath192 and zero quasiparticle mass : @xmath193 where    @xmath194    here , @xmath195 is the dirac delta - function , and : @xmath196 @xmath197 quasiparticle energies are now @xmath198 .",
    "the expression  ( [ uscalar ] ) defines infinities at @xmath199 completely , except when @xmath200 . in that case , however , it can be shown by finite - size regularization that @xmath147 at @xmath199 diverges only logarithmically with the system size , which does not affect the important integrals over energies in the limit of infinite system size beyond what is given by the expression  ( [ uscalar ] ) .",
    "the effective vortex action  ( [ vactfull ] ) depends on @xmath190 through : @xmath201 where we have used  ( [ uexpr ] ) , relevant for the quasiparticle node at @xmath202 .",
    "note that this dependence on vortex coordinates is not isotropic ; only final expressions with all quasiparticle nodes included become isotropic .",
    "it is easily checked from  ( [ bdg ] ) that the linearized hamiltonians at different nodes are related by unitary transformations and an exchange @xmath203 as needed , in absence of the doppler shift .",
    "thus , in order to add contributions at all nodes we only need to symmetrize with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath160 and multiply by the number of nodes : @xmath204 note that for our purposes we do not need to worry about inter - node scattering of quasiparticles .",
    "if we went back to the non - linear quasiparticle hamiltonian and calculated @xmath190 for states that belong to different nodes , we could obtain singular behavior only when the momentum transfer is @xmath205 .",
    "such transitions are not stimulated by a slowly moving vortex , and can not play a significant role in low - energy vortex dynamics .",
    "owing to the degeneracy of the quasiparticle energies with respect to angular momentum , it is possible to analytically carry out summation over angular momentum channels in  ( [ vactfull ] ) , that is summation over @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "vortex mass and possible dissipation are determined by the following sum , which is just a geometric series that we evaluate from  ( [ uscalar ] ) : @xmath208 here , we have dropped the dirac delta - functions in  ( [ uscalar ] ) , since in  ( [ vactfull ] ) there is a factor that becomes zero when @xmath209 ( safe to do only in absence of the doppler shift ) .",
    "for the same reason the other possible divergences at @xmath210 , in  ( [ uscalar ] ) or in the sum over angular momenta turn out not be dangerous : they actually appear only when @xmath211 as well , that is only when @xmath209 ( particle - particle or hole - hole transitions ) .",
    "similarly , we find the sum that determines `` transversal dynamics '' : @xmath212      this subsection collects our results above and computes the contribution of the @xmath146-flux to the vortex mass .",
    "we will find that this contribution is finite .",
    "the vortex mass is determined by the `` longitudinal '' part of the vortex action  ( [ vactlt ] ) .",

    "at zero temperature the difference between fermi - dirac functions @xmath213 allows only transitions between states whose energies have opposite signs .",
    "this means that only particle - hole transitions will be allowed . using the invariance of  ( [ usuml ] ) under exchange @xmath214 , and symmetrizing the `` longitudinal '' part of  ( [ vactfull ] ) with respect to its complex conjugate",

    "if slow vortex dynamics reduces to vortex inertia , then the leading low - frequency term in the `` longitudinal '' vortex action is : @xmath216 where @xmath37 is the vortex mass : @xmath217 note that this expression is obtained by simply setting @xmath118 in the denominator of  ( [ vactt0 ] ) , which is justified only if @xmath37 turns out to be finite . in absence of thermal fluctuations",
    "@xmath37 could in principle be infra - red divergent only due to transitions at @xmath218 .",
    "however , only the bulk density of states , which shapes such transitions , can be responsible for infra - red divergences . in the bulk , far away from the vortex core , ldos is linear in energy ( see  ( [ ldos ] ) ) and hence suppresses transitions at @xmath185 .",
    "this is formally reflected in the sum  ( [ usuml ] ) by absence of the singularity at @xmath219 , @xmath220 .",
    "then , without help from the transition matrix elements , the extra factor of @xmath221 in  ( [ vortexmass ] ) is innocuous and fully integrable .",
    "note that the @xmath155 behavior of ldos close to the vortex core matters , but not enough to cause infra - red divergency of @xmath37 ; it produces the second term in  ( [ usuml ] ) , including the logarithms , but no singularity at @xmath185 .",
    "careful integration , presented in appendix [ appvortexmass ] , shows that indeed the vortex mass is finite : @xmath222 therefore , vortex dynamics at zero temperature is entirely specified by inertia .",
    "the cut - off scale @xmath49 is roughly given by the maximum superconducting gap @xmath132 .",

    "for example , this can be expected in presence of disorder , or zeeman splitting in magnetic field . in such situations",
    "the vortex mass calculated from the expression  ( [ vortexmass ] ) could become infra - red divergent , and it would be more appropriate to go back to the full action  ( [ vactt0 ] ) .      at finite temperatures the `` longitudinal '' part of the vortex action is : @xmath227 the difference between fermi - dirac functions @xmath228 does not strictly prohibit transitions between two particle - like or two hole - like states at @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , singularities in which the factors @xmath221 become zero at finite energies will be included in the vortex action",

    "similarly , it will be clear shortly that the precise boundaries of @xmath235 do not matter after analytic continuation .",
    "the sum over angular momenta is given by  ( [ usuml ] ) .",
    "its `` most divergent '' part ( @xmath236 term ) , which comes from the particle - particle and hole - hole transitions that involve the zero angular momentum channel , dominates the small frequency behavior : @xmath237 after analytic continuation to real frequency , this has the `` ohmic '' dissipation form of the bardeen - stephen viscous drag .",
    "the ellipses denote corrections that become more noticeable as the frequency grows .",
    "the first such correction is also interesting and comes from particle - particle and hole - hole transitions that do not involve the zero angular momentum channel ( @xmath238 term of  ( [ usuml ] ) ) : @xmath239 & & \\hspace{-5 mm } \\approx \\frac{\\log(2)}{8 }   \\left ( \\frac{1}{v_f^2 } + \\frac{1}{v_{\\delta}^2 } \\right )     t",

    "with such an interpretation the vortex mass at rest would be logarithmically divergent .",
    "however , we feel that it is more natural to associate only the strictly quadratic frequency behavior to the vortex mass , and regard everything that dominates it at small frequencies as various forms of dissipation .",
    "all other corrections are @xmath240 , and hence contribute the normal vortex mass .    in conclusion",
    ", dissipation occurs at finite temperatures , its strength being a power law in temperature due to the gapless quasiparticle nodes .",
    "the `` transversal correlation '' @xmath241 defined in  ( [ vactlt ] ) describes aspects of vortex dynamics that are associated with the magnus force .",

    "the physical reason for complete absence of quasiparticle - induced transversal forces is related to the fact that there are no circulating currents of quasiparticles in thermal equilibrium .",

    "we adapt the expression  ( [ vactfull ] ) and write the longitudinal part of the vortex action : @xmath286 we will use labels @xmath287 for the exact eigenstates , and @xmath105 for exact energies .",

    "the finite size scaling can be done in two ways , by changing either @xmath283 , or @xmath49 .",
    "this is because there is no specific scale in the linearized hamiltonian and thermodynamic limit ( all coordinate dependence comes from the products @xmath300 ) .",

    "the total density of states at low energies in figure [ dos ] is easily obtained from the exact spectra , and it is indicative of the bulk ldos . the bulk ldos remains a linear function of energy , and roughly equal to ldos in absence of the doppler shift , as expected .",

    "the transition matrix elements  ( [ umatrel ] ) that involve these states and other normalizable states are always finite ; the only possible concern are the `` diagonal '' matrix elements , but they must be finite as well because the states at finite energies carry finite momenta .    the last argument against dissipation and anomalous dynamics",
    "is presented in the appendix [ appsemianalytical ] . there",
    "we study in detail analytic properties of the exact transition matrix elements @xmath190 . making use of the known transition matrix elements  ( [ uexpr ] ) between the basis states in absence of the doppler shift , we ask the following general question : what should",
    "the exact eigenstates look like in this basis in order for dissipation to occur .",
    "the general conclusion is that dissipation would require from the exact hamiltonian to either systematically shift or shuffle the energy levels of the basis states in vicinity of the zero energy .",
    "the first scenario is equivalent to an effective chemical potential for the linearized quasiparticles , and it was discussed in the appendix  ( [ ssecvint ] ) , while the second scenario could happen due to zeeman splitting or disorder . in both cases the bulk ldos would be finite .",
    "neither of these scenarios seem to be realized in our situation of interest , when we consider the quantum - coherent doppler shift due to the circulating supercurrents of a single vortex .",
    "we studied various effects introduced by nodal quasiparticles in clean @xmath0-wave superconductors on dynamics of isolated vortices in thermal equilibrium .",
    "these effects generally give dominant contributions to vortex mass and dissipation in fermionic superfluids , over the corresponding contributions of the superfluid order parameter . in @xmath0-wave superconductors the quasiparticles have gapless nodes , and",
    "this makes quantum - mechanical phenomena fundamentally important for vortex dynamics at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , we used methods that carefully took into account the phase change of quasiparticle wavefunction upon encircling a vortex , resulting with the proper determination of quasiparticle density of states .",
    "classical effects of the superfluid flow in the vicinity of a vortex were taken into account through the doppler shift of quasiparticle hamiltonian , and it was shown that they do not lead to qualitative changes , but give rise to important quantitative corrections to the vortex mass .",
    "vortex dynamics was studied both perturbatively and non - perturbatively , and the two approaches yielded the same results .",
    "the perturbation theory was formulated in a dual description of d - wave superconductors , where the cooper - pair fluctuations are handled as a u(1 ) gauge field that mediates interactions between `` charged '' particle - like vortices .",
    "the non - perturbative approach was focused on the small - amplitude response of a vortex to a weak oscillating force .",
    "our findings are also in agreement with simple scaling arguments that regard the d - wave quasiparticles as a quantum critical system .",
    "our main conclusions are the following : ( 1 ) at zero temperature the vortex mass is finite and completely specifies vortex dynamics , apart from a universal `` sub - ohmic '' damping ; ( 2 ) at finite temperatures vortex motion becomes dissipated in an ohmic fashion , with certain logarithmic corrections .",
    "furthermore , quasiparticles mediate new interactions between vortices ( assumed to be far enough apart so that quasiparticle motion between vortices is incoherent ) , leading to both longitudinal and transversal forces in addition to the usual `` hydrodynamic '' forces .",
    "all parameters that characterize vortex dynamics depend quantitatively ( and not qualitatively ) on the boundary conditions at the vortex core .",
    "we reached these conclusions under several assumptions .",
    "first , the vortex core was idealized by a point in the continuum limit .",
    "this was primarily motivated by the fact that in good @xmath0-wave superconductors the coherence length @xmath6 is not much larger than the fermi wavelength @xmath351 , so that the core is indeed small .",
    "furthermore , the superconducting gap vanishes in the nodal momentum directions , leaving a route for quasiparticles inside the core to leak out . both of these facts conspire against bound core states , which is the situation that our idealization of the core models well , and various other studies support .",
    "the vortex mass is , then , determined by scattering of free quasiparticles from a moving vortex .",
    "smallness of the core renders quantum phenomena very important . at finite temperatures we ignored thermal fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter , but kept the quasiparticles in thermal equilibrium .",
    "presumably , as long as temperatures are low and quasiparticle contributions to vortex dynamics dominant , such an approximation is valid .",
    "effects of thermal non - equilibrium have not been taken into account , but they are expected not to be important in the circumstances that we consider ( slow oscillatory vortex motion with very small amplitude ) .    as we noted in section",
    "[ sec : intro ] , there is a possible disagreement between our results and the semiclassical approach@xcite .",
    "the latter works find that the nodal quasiparticles induce an effective mass which diverges linearly with the separation between vortices .",
    "in particular , it does appear that direct application of our theory and the semiclassical theory leads to distinct predictions for a certain class of experiments .",
    "it has recently been argued@xcite that the zero point quantum motion of vortices leads to modulations in the local density of states , and this was proposed as the explanation of recent stm experiments on the cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "the spatial extent of the zero point motion , and hence density modulations , is determined @xcite by the value of @xmath37 .",
    "( indeed , this fact was the initial motivation for our study . ) consequently , @xmath37 can be determined , in principle , from stm measurements of the modulations .",
    "our theory predicts that such an @xmath37 should be independent of the field @xmath96 , at small @xmath96 , while the semiclassical theory predicts a divergence in @xmath37 as @xmath352 .    in the future , it is also possible that dynamic ( thz scale ) measurements of vortex dynamics will lead to more direct quantitative determinations of @xmath37 , and these should allow tests of the theoretical proposals .    at the end",
    ", we make some comments about the incoherent quasiparticle mediated interactions between vortices , explored in the appendix [ ssecvint ] .",
    "they were modeled by an effective chemical potential @xmath13 in the linearized quasiparticle hamiltonian , which describes the doppler shift due to the supercurrents from a second nearby vortex .",
    "the interactions that we discussed in appendix  [ ssecvint ] are specific to @xmath0-wave superconductors ( for similar effects to be observed in @xmath329-wave superconductors , @xmath13 would have to be larger than the gap , that is the two vortices practically overlapping ) .",
    "the effects of these interactions would be visible in vortex - vortex scattering events : the vortices would lose some of their initial kinetic energy during scattering , and excite some low - energy extended quasiparticle states .",
    "anisotropy of @xmath0-wave superconductors would be reflected in these interactions , so that the differential scattering cross - section , and the amount of kinetic energy lost , would depend on the initial direction of approach toward the point of collision .",
    "we also speculate that these interactions might play an important role in shaping the properties of vortex lattices ( especially if pinning disorder ruins the vortex lattice inversion symmetry ) .",
    "they could lead to anisotropic stiffness and pinning of the vortex lattice orientation to that of the substrate .",
    "the discovered dissipation - looking response of a single vortex in presence of another vortex could transform into significant and magnetic field dependent correction to the vortex mass in the equilibrium conditions of the vortex lattice .",

    "both singularities can be crossed at the same time.,height=96 ]    what remains to be examined is how sending @xmath325 to zero may affect this picture . generally , the integration over @xmath288 discussed above picks divergences of both wavefunctions in  ( [ rfunct2 ] ) , so that the resulting function of @xmath235 may be non - analytic or even divergent at some @xmath475 . in particular ,",
    "if the only divergences of the wavefunctions are dirac peaks ( as it seems ) , then the resulting function of @xmath235 is divergent as a dirac peak at @xmath476 ; other finite non - analyticities in the wavefunctions do not matter .",
    "now , integrating out @xmath235 is sensitive to such a divergence and the final result ( which should be finite for @xmath477 ) may end up scaling as @xmath478 for small @xmath325 .",
    "however , this can actually happen only if we introduce some non - zero chemical potential @xmath13 .",
    "otherwise , we always approach the @xmath479 limit only together with @xmath480 , and no divergence emerges from  ( [ rfunct2 ] ) ( for details , see analytical calculations in absence of the doppler shift - this is equivalent to reducing the present exact wavefunctions to pure dirac peaks , and such divergences do not give rise to dissipation without a non - zero chemical potential ) .    in conclusion , the transitions that involve the zero angular momentum , which are the most critical for appearance of anomalous vortex dynamics ,",
    "seem to qualitatively follow the same behavior as if there were no doppler shift .",
    "consider first the `` most divergent '' terms in  ( [ uexpr ] ) for @xmath481 : @xmath482 and substitute them into  ( [ rfunct2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath483 function takes care of the signs for positive or negative @xmath206 in  ( [ uexpr ] ) . ignoring @xmath484 and the vector structure of @xmath452",
    ", we find : @xmath485 according to our assumptions from the beginning of this appendix , the energies @xmath288 at which the wavefunctions @xmath486 are non - analytic do not depend on angular momentum @xmath206 .",
    "therefore , we can first sum up @xmath206 - the result should be finite , and have the same analytical properties as the original expression .",
    "then , we integrate out @xmath288 .",
    "as long as @xmath477 , the two wavefunctions in the integral can not diverge at the same value of @xmath288 , so that , according to our assumptions , the integral over @xmath288 is finite .",
    "exactly for @xmath487 , the result may be infinite , and it is @xmath488 if the wavefunction divergence at @xmath489 is a dirac peak .",
    "this is essentially the same situation as in the case without the doppler shift : @xmath488 is killed by the factors of @xmath325 in the vortex action .    now consider the remaining portion of  ( [ uexpr ] ) for @xmath481 and substitute : @xmath490 into @xmath463 from  ( [ rfunct2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath483 function selects whether the argument of the step @xmath491-function should be @xmath492 for positive @xmath206 or @xmath493 for negative @xmath206 ( see  ( [ uexpr ] ) , and recall @xmath494 ) .",
    "we could roughly follow the previous argument , although the summation over @xmath206 is not entirely trivial - it may introduce a singularity at @xmath209 . since the wavefunction amplitudes can not grow indefinitely with @xmath206 ,",
    "this new singular behavior is in the worst case : @xmath495 ( see for example  ( [ usuml ] ) ) .",
    "after summation over @xmath206 we are left with an integral over @xmath243 and @xmath244 , which has a very similar structure to the one that we considered in the previous subsection . by repeating the same argument , we arrive to the conclusion that we could obtain anomalous vortex dynamics only with a non - zero chemical potential ."
