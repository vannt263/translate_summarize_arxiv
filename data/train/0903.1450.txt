    "multi - unit auctions have been studied comprehensively in microeconomics and auction theory literature @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the problem of budget - constrained bidders has been paid surprisingly little attention , despite of the fact that in practice , bidders face natural budget constraints . as an example , an important type of multi - unit auctions with budget - constrained bidders is sponsored search and contextual auctions @xcite where advertisers normally submit their bids for each query and the total monthly advertising budget .",
    "then it is the auctioneer s ( e.g. google , or yahoo ! ) job to allocate slots and decide the pricing such that no advertiser has to pay more than her monthly budget .",
    "one reason the budget constraints have not received much attention is the technical difficulty that the utility of obtaining the items is compared to the total price at which the items are procured to give a net payoff . perhaps",
    "because of this , the theoretical framework of budget - constrained auctions is currently substantially less well - developed than that of unconstrained auctions .",
    "this is unsatisfactory both from a theoretical viewpoint , and from the practical viewpoint , where the absence of appropriate framework might potentially result in losses in revenue and efficiency .      in this paper",
    "we study multi - unit auctions with budget limits .",
    "we suppose there are @xmath0 identical divisible units of a single item for sale .",
    "each bidder @xmath1 has a private value @xmath2 for each unit , and a private budget limit @xmath3 on the total amount she may pay .",
    "we assume that bidder @xmath1 s utility from acquiring @xmath4 units and paying price @xmath5 is @xmath6 as long as the price is within budget : @xmath7 , and is negative infinity if @xmath8 .",
    "( i.e. the budget constraint is _ hard_. note that this is the assumption that may be considered unnatural in the more usual quasi - linear utility maximization models . )    throughout the paper , for simplicity of description we always assume there exist a bidder with value @xmath9 and budget @xmath10 ( she has enough money to buy all the items with her value ) . as @xmath9 tends to zero , the revenue of this modified instance approaches that of the original , and hence this assumption is without loss of generality .      1 .",
    "we propose a new mechanism , called sort - cut , for selling _ all _ the units . in the",
    ", no agent can benefit from lying about her budget .",
    "however , some people may increase their revenue by lying about their value , but only by overstating their value .",
    "we show that the allocation of the  is pareto - optimal ( defined formally later ) ; hence , it is nearly the best possible result that can be obtained for this problem since the recent result of dobzinski , lavi and nisan @xcite shows that there is no truthful pareto - optimal deterministic mechanism for this problem .",
    "we also obtain an upper - bound @xmath11 ( which coincides with the revenue of  for truthful bids ) for the revenue of _ any _ pareto - optimal mechanism and then show that if the sum of budgets of all bidders is at least twice of @xmath11 , this upper - bound is achievable by .",
    "3 .   assuming reasonable behavior of the bidders ( defined as rational bidding in definition [ rational ] ) , we show that any equilibrium of sort - cut has a revenue of at least @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the maximum budget among the winners , and prove this bound is tight for all pareto - optimal mechanisms which are budget - truthful ( bidders can not benefit from lying about their budgets ) .",
    "4 .   finally , we study the dynamics of the auction and show that under some natural assumptions , the unique equilibrium of the game is the one that maximizes the revenue ( attains revenue @xmath11 ) .",
    "the equilibrium turns out to be the same as the outcome of  in which bidders are bidding truthfully .",
    "the problem of multi - unit auctions with budget - constrained bidders was initiated by borgs et al . in  @xcite .",
    "our model is identical to theirs .",
    "they introduce a truthful mechanism that is asymptotically revenue - maximizing ; however , it may leave some units unsold .",
    "the idea is to group the people randomly into two groups , and use the market clearing price of each group as an offering price to the other group .    a second paper that uses the same model is by abrams  @xcite .",
    "it basically uses the same idea of @xcite but with some improvements .",
    "the proposed mechanism may still leave some units unsold .    another recent paper that analyzes this problem by dobzinsky et al .",
    "@xcite , mainly proves an impossibility result .",
    "they first assume that budgets of all players are publicly known .",
    "then they give a truthful mechanism which solves the problem under this assumption .",
    "their mechanism is a direct application of ausubel s auction @xcite .",
    "they define the demand of each bidder at any time to be her budget ( which is assumed to be publicly known ) divided by the current price of ausubel s clock auction .",
    "the demand is defined to be zero for bidders who have values lower than the current price . with respect to this demand function ,",
    "they allocate the units and define the prices using ausubel s clock auction .",
    "then they show that this mechanism is the unique mechanism which is both truthful and pareto - optimal under the assumption of publicly known budgets . finally by showing that their mechanism is not truthful",
    "if the budgets are private knowledge , they conclude that no mechanism for this problem can be both truthful and pareto - optimal .    both @xcite and @xcite argue that lack of quasi - linearity ( because of hard budget constraints )",
    "is the most important difficulty of the problem .",
    "still some papers have tried to solve the problem by relaxing hard budget constraints @xcite , or modeling the budget constraint as an upper bound on the value obtained by the bidder rather than her payment @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that modeling budget constraints with quasi - linear functions can lead to arbitrarily bad revenue .",
    "another paper that has studied budget constraints , mainly for advertisement auctions , is the work of feldman et al.@xcite .",
    "they give a truthful mechanism for ad auctions with budget - constrained advertisers where there are multiple slots available for each query , and an advertiser can not appear in more than one slot per query .",
    "their work is related to our work because they also consider the game - theoretic aspects of the problem .",
    "however , the utility function that they use is very different from ours . in @xcite",
    "they define advertisers to be click - maximizers , while in our model , advertisers are profit - maximizers .",
    "other papers that have considered budgets in auctions include @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , @xcite only considers the offline optimization problem and does not study the game theoretic aspects of the problem .",
    "they also model budget constraints by value functions of the bidders , which means bidders are not willing to get value more than their budget . in @xcite , they study an auction for selling two single items to budget - constrained bidders .",
    "they mainly focus on the effect of bidding aggressively on an unwanted item with the purpose of depleting other bidders budget .",
    "similar situation happens in our model too , but the focus of our work is generally very different from theirs .",
    "another paper @xcite compares first - price and all - pay auctions in a budget - constrained setting and show that the expected payoff of all - pay auctions is better under some assumptions .",
    "however , they do not consider multi - unit items , and do not propose any new mechanisms .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ desc ]",
    "we describe our proposed mechanism and show some examples of how it works . in section [ semitruth ]",
    "we show that our mechanism is close to a truthful mechanism by proving that it is weakly dominant for the bidders to tell the truth about their budget and not to understate their values .",
    "then in section [ pareto ] we use a proposition of @xcite to prove the pareto - optimality of .",
    "we step into revenue analysis in section [ rev ] by proving some theorems which state  is almost revenue optimal .",
    "finally , in section [ equ ] we show that if bidders use a natural greedy algorithm for bidding , the only equilibrium of the infinitely repeated game is revenue optimal .",
    "we conclude our work and introduce some possible extensions in section [ conc ] .",
    "in this section we describe how our mechanism allocates the units , and how each bidder is charged . without loss of generality , assume that @xmath14 .",
    "the algorithm assigns some units to the bidders @xmath15 through @xmath16 , and assigns nothing to the bidders @xmath17 through @xmath18 .",
    "( we describe later how we determine @xmath16 ) the bidders @xmath19 must have exhausted almost ( we will define what we mean by almost ) all their budget , and bidder @xmath16 may be left with some money from her budget @xmath20 .",
    "bidders @xmath21 do not pay anything .",
    "suppose that the money left for bidder @xmath16 is @xmath22 , and define @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 define @xmath25 .",
    "( @xmath26 denotes the number of units that bidder @xmath1 can buy according to her value for one unit . )",
    "now we charge bidder @xmath1 ( for @xmath27 ) for the first @xmath28 items that she wins a price of @xmath29 , for the next @xmath30 items that she wins a price of @xmath31 , for the next @xmath32 items that she wins a price @xmath33 and so on until her remaining budget can not buy the next whole item ( at this point , her budget is almost exhausted ) . for bidder @xmath16 , we start charging her a price of @xmath31 for the first @xmath30 items that she gets , @xmath33 for the next @xmath32 items that she gets and so on until she has exhausted all her allocated spending budget of @xmath34 .",
    "we give each bidder @xmath1 ( @xmath27 ) as many units as she can afford according to our pricing and her budget .",
    "the only point that needs to be cleared here , is how we determine @xmath16 , and @xmath22 ( the money which is left for the last winner ) , because they play an important role in our pricing mechanism .",
    "if the index @xmath16 is very large ( close to @xmath18 ) , then the prices for the units will be very low and the number of units that each winner can afford increases , also the number of winners is large , that results in shortage of supply . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath16 is chosen very small ( close to @xmath15 ) , we have few winners , and relatively high prices , so a number of units will be left unsold .",
    "we seek to find the right point which determines bidder @xmath16 and the amount of money @xmath22 left for her , such that the market clears at this point .    to be more precise , define @xmath35 .",
    "we are looking for a breakpoint ( boundary ) @xmath36 in the interval @xmath37 $ ] that determines for us both @xmath16 and @xmath22 .",
    "we want to sell all items .",
    "we must also guarantee that the bidders @xmath38 ( which are determined by @xmath39 ) do not have enough budget to buy any additional item .",
    "as we increase @xmath39 , the prices decrease , the number of winners and items demanded to be allocated increases , and consequently the demand increases .",
    "we can find the solution by slowly increasing @xmath39 from @xmath40 until the demand becomes equal to supply .",
    "in other words , we increase @xmath39 until the total number of units that bidders @xmath15 through @xmath16 want ( assuming that bidder @xmath16 can use only @xmath41 of her budget ) becomes equal to the units that we have to sell .",
    "algorithmically , we can use a simple binary search for finding the right value for @xmath39 .    finally , to keep the bidders from overstating their budget , we add the following to sort - cut .",
    "suppose that the  wants to charge a bidder @xmath1 an amount equal to @xmath5 , and her announced budget is @xmath3 . instead of charging her @xmath5",
    ", we charge her @xmath3 with probability @xmath42 and @xmath40 otherwise . in this way , if somebody overstates her budget , she is accepting the risk of paying more than her budget which makes her expected utility equal to minus infinity ( this is because we have hard budget constraints ) . to make the situation more practical ,",
    "even if we get into this process with probability @xmath9 , and simply charge the bidder @xmath5 in the rest of the cases , still bidders can not take the risk of overstating their budget .",
    "[ ex1 ]    we give an example to show how our mechanism works for selling @xmath43 units of an indivisible item to a set of @xmath44 bidders with the following ( private ) values per item and budgets .    [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this example , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if we assume that  uses binary search for finding the right breakpoint , the first guess would be @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . therefore , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the first bidder wins @xmath53 items ( @xmath54 ) ; the first @xmath55 of them with price @xmath56 for each , and the next @xmath57 with price @xmath53 for each .",
    "the total amount of money that the first winner has to pay is @xmath58 .",
    "now , we look at the second bidder .",
    "note that she is the one on the boundary , so she has different pricing scheme .",
    "she can use up to @xmath59 of her budget .",
    "the first @xmath57 items that she gets cost @xmath53 for her each , and other items ( if she can afford ) cost @xmath60 for her each .",
    "therefore , she can get @xmath57 items with a total price of @xmath61 .",
    "we see that demand is @xmath62 while supply is @xmath46 .",
    "this means that @xmath47 is too small for the breakpoint .",
    "we continue our binary search with @xmath63 .",
    "now , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the price of the first unit , the second unit , and ... that each winner wins ( for bidders @xmath15 and @xmath55 ) is @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the demand of the first bidder according to this pricing scheme is @xmath69 , which means nothing will be left for the second bidder .",
    "this situation shows that @xmath39 is too large for the breakpoint , so we have to continue our binary search with @xmath70 .    by continuing the binary search ,",
    "after trying values @xmath71 we finally end up with the following pricing and allocation .",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath64 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the prices of the first unit , second unit , ... for the first two bidders are : @xmath78 .",
    "if the reader has not followed all the details for this example , it is instructive at least to apply the mechanism for the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 to see how the value of @xmath72 gives the clearing point .",
    "another example of  behavior is when there is only one unit for sale ( i.e. @xmath81 ) . in this case , suppose that @xmath82 is the smallest index such that there exists some @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "( note that @xmath82 always exists , because we have added a dummy bidder with value @xmath9 to the set of bidders ) .",
    "now , take @xmath1 the smallest index with @xmath84 .",
    "the mechanism assigns the single unit to bidder @xmath1 with price @xmath85 .",
    "a special case of this example is when bidders do not have budget constraints . in that case ,  is equivalent to the second price auction .",
    "although we first described above the sort - cut mechanism for indivisible units , we will henceforth assume that the units are divisible .",
    "note that in the divisible case , we will require that for the bidders @xmath86 , all their budget is spent while for bidder @xmath16 all but @xmath22 is spent .",
    "the divisibility assumption helps us to understand  more easily .",
    "in this example , we use the same numbers as in example [ ex1 ] but here for the case of divisible units .",
    "we start with @xmath87 , so @xmath64 and @xmath88 .",
    "this means that the price of each unit ( for the first two bidders ) is @xmath53 for the first @xmath89 that they spend , and after that for the next @xmath90 that they spend , the price for each unit is reduced to @xmath60 , and finally , after that the price is @xmath9 for each unit .",
    "therefore , the first bidder can afford @xmath91 units with a total price of @xmath92 .",
    "but the second bidder can afford all the remaining units now ( which means nothing will be left for the third bidder , who must be assigned something according to our breakpoint ) .",
    "this means that @xmath39 is too large for the breakpoint .",
    "our next guess is @xmath94 , so @xmath64 and @xmath95 . here , the price ( for the first two bidders ) is @xmath53 per unit for the first @xmath96 that they spend , and @xmath60 per unit for the next @xmath90 that they spend , and @xmath9 per unit after that",
    ". therefore , the first bidder can afford @xmath97 and the second bidder can afford @xmath98 units .",
    "the third bidder can use @xmath53 of her money and she has to pay @xmath60 per unit for the first @xmath90 that she spends .",
    "therefore , she can afford @xmath99 units .",
    "we can see that @xmath100 , therefore , @xmath39 is too small for the breakpoint .    by continuing the same procedure",
    ", we will see that @xmath101 is the right value for @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and the prices they pay are @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "the implications follow by a simple analysis of the outcome of the sort - cut mechanism .    in the first case @xmath86 , since the budget of an agent who is assigned good",
    "is decreased , the market will not clear at the old value of @xmath39 and there will be left over supply .",
    "thus the new clearing point @xmath140 must be larger than @xmath39 ; clearly , it can not be more than the amount by which the bidder @xmath82 understates her budget since the resulting changed prices will be used not only for bidder @xmath82 but for all other bidders up to @xmath16 .    in the second case",
    "when @xmath144 , the left over budget @xmath22 of this bidder has decreased by @xmath9 .",
    "thus the pricing scheme for all bidders @xmath145 has become better since the items they procure at the unit rate of @xmath29 went down by @xmath9 .",
    "with the revised price scheme , the demand from these bidders will increase . to clear the increased demand , the breakpoint @xmath140 will have to be less than @xmath39 . as before it can not decrease by more than @xmath9 since even one bidder faced with this increase will reduce the demand by the equivalent amount .",
    "the case @xmath146 is similar to the previous one since the decrease in the budget of bidder @xmath82 can reduce the unit price for the agents who are assigned the item ; the calculations are identical as well .",
    "although dobzinski et al .",
    "@xcite shows that no truthful pareto - optimal mechanism exists for this problem , it is still interesting to know _ how truthful _ a pareto - optimal mechanism can be . in other words ,",
    "we want to know how much the bidders can benefit from lying , and how the different ways of lying can benefit them in a mechanism .",
    "there are basically four ways that a bidder can lie : overstating budget , understating budget , overstating value and understating value . in different mechanisms",
    ", bidders may take different strategies and use either of these ways to increase their utility .",
    "we show that in , the only way out of these four that the bidder can use to benefit from lying is by overstating value .",
    "this result is interesting because first , we know that some kind of lying must be beneficiary for the bidders if the mechanism is pareto - optimal , and second , among four different ways of lying , this is the most desirable one for the auctioneer  giving good revenue properties ( this is formalized in section  [ rev ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the revenue of  is monotone with respect to the vector of bids .",
    "( i.e. if bidders increase their stated values , the revenue of the mechanism does not decrease . )",
    "we say a mechanism @xmath147 is semi - truthful if it is a weakly dominant strategy for the bidders to bid their real budgets and not to understate their value .",
    "is semi - truthful .",
    "there are three cases :    1 .",
    "consider a bidder @xmath82 where @xmath148 .",
    "obviously @xmath82 can not benefit from overstating her value because all winners @xmath38 have the same pricing policy .",
    "also , she can not benefit from lying about her budget , because if she overstates her budget , she will be charged more than her budget which makes her utility minus infinity .",
    "if she understates her budget , we show that her payoff does not increase : the payoff before understating her budget is @xmath149 , while after understating to @xmath139 , it is at most @xmath150 ( see proposition  [ pr : delta ] ) . since @xmath151 , the implication follows .",
    "+ if bidder @xmath82 understates her value , she may still remain among the first @xmath118 bidders which does not change anything for her , or , she may go to the boundary which makes the situation trickier , or she may go below the boundary which decreases her utility .",
    "so the only case that we must handle is when she goes to the boundary .",
    "+ suppose bidder @xmath82 moves to the boundary by announcing a value @xmath152 and she spends @xmath153 of her money while @xmath154 of her money will be remaining .",
    "( so we have @xmath155 ) we know that before going to the boundary , with @xmath22 of her budget she bought the units for price @xmath29 per unit , and after that she had unit prices @xmath156 .",
    "now when she goes to the boundary , she buys for prices @xmath157 which are lower and seem to be better for her , but as we will see , that is not the case because she is not using all her money when she is on the boundary .",

    "now , consider bidder @xmath16 to see how many units she wins after leaving the boundary . now",

    "now consider a bidder @xmath82 where @xmath164 .",
    "note that this person has incentive to overstate her budget , because in this way she may increase the price for the winners , decrease their demand and probably win some units ; but because overstating budget leads to paying more than real budget with some positive probability , and makes the expected utility minus infinity , bidders will never overstate their budget .",

    "( the lowest valued one may be partially allocated , but still for price @xmath190 per unit . )",
    "we define @xmath11 to be the revenue of  in which bidders are bidding truthfully .",
    "note that  is pareto - optimal , but is not truthful.(a bidder may benefit from both understating her value and her budget . )    if we have two bidders with @xmath191 and @xmath192 and @xmath57 units of the item to be sold , then the  will be @xmath193 and revenue will be @xmath194 .",
    "if we have @xmath195 instead of @xmath196 , then @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "if we run  for the data of example [ ex1 ] , we will have : @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath105 , @xmath202 , @xmath106 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 .    in the next lemma",
    ", we show an upper bound on the revenue of any mechanism which guarantees pareto - optimality .",
    "no pareto - optimal mechanism can guarantee revenue more than @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that @xmath190 is the  and let @xmath205 be the greatest index such that @xmath206 . if a mechanism @xmath147 generates a revenue more that @xmath11 , it must charge some bidder @xmath1 ( @xmath207 ) more than @xmath190 per unit .",
    "but if bidder @xmath1 decreases her bid down to @xmath208 , the mechanism still has to exhaust all her budget ( otherwise , because of pareto - optimality , it can not charge the people who have value @xmath190 or less , and consequently can not even make revenue @xmath11 ) but now with price of at most @xmath208 .",
    "that means that at an equilibrium of the mechanism , no bidder can be charged more than @xmath190 per unit .",
    "for the rest of this section , we want to give a lower bound for the revenue of .",
    "but before that , we need to introduce the concept of _ rational bidding_.    [ rational ] we say that bidders are bidding rationally , if those who do not win anything bid at least their true value .",
    "( the motivation for the definition arises from the fact that someone who is not winning anything can never benefit from understating her value . )",
    "assuming rational bidding , the  always makes a revenue of at least @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the maximum budget among the winners .",
    "suppose that  has used all the budget of bidders @xmath38 and a part of the budget of @xmath16-th bidder .",
    "also suppose that  for truthful bids is @xmath190 where @xmath209 . as we defined    @xmath210    where @xmath3 is the budget of @xmath1-th bidder .",
    "note that the revenue of  is @xmath211 where @xmath22 is the amount of money left unused by the @xmath16-th bidder .",
    "also note that    @xmath212 ( this is by definition of )    now , we are ready to prove the claim . consider an output of the .",
    "since the revenue of  is less than @xmath11 and both mechanisms sell all @xmath0 units , there must be some winner @xmath1 who is getting the item cheaper than @xmath190 per unit .",
    "we can either have @xmath27 or @xmath213 .",
    "first suppose that @xmath27 . according to our pricing scheme",
    ", bidder @xmath1 has to pay at least @xmath190 per unit up to @xmath214 of her budget ( see figure [ firstfig ] ) .",
    "that means if @xmath1 is paying less than @xmath190 on average per unit , her budget must be more than @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , @xmath215 which implies @xmath216 .",
    "now consider the case where @xmath213",
    ". here , bidder @xmath1 is using @xmath217 of her budget , and she has to pay at least @xmath190 per unit up to @xmath218 of her budget .",
    "therefore , if she pays less than @xmath190 on average per unit , the amount of her budget that she is actually using , @xmath217 , must be more than @xmath218 .",
    "that is @xmath219 , equivalently , @xmath220 .",
    "note any mechanism which is truthful for the budgets ( like ) can not guarantee a revenue higher that @xmath12 .",
    "this can be shown by a simple example in which there is only one bidder .",
    "no budget - truthful mechanism can charge this bidder more than @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , our bound of @xmath12 is tight , and the best achievable in budget - truthful mechanisms .",
    "in this section , we try to answer the following question : for natural repeated strategies , if the vector of bids stabilizes , at what bids can it stabilize ?",
    "we focus on simple strategies and impose some assumptions and restrictions .",
    "first , we assume that all values are common knowledge : over time , advertisers are likely to learn all relevant information about each other s values .",
    "second , since bids can be changed at any time , stable bids must be best responses to one another . in this section",
    ", we are using the same approach that edelman et al @xcite used to model the generalized second price ( gsp ) auctions . like in their paper , we assume that the bidders are playing an infinitely repeated game , and use this to obtain some equilibria properties for .",
    "we then take the approach of a consequent paper @xcite which shows that a natural bidding strategy played by all bidders leads to a unique nash equilibrium of gsp , and that the nash equilibrium coincides with the outcome of a vcg auction . here , we show that a natural bidding strategy , called _ greedy bidding _ , leads to a unique equilibrium of the game which coincides with the outcome of ; this shows the revenue optimality of the equilibrium .",
    "if we assume that revenue @xmath11 of  for truthful bids is less than half of the total budget of all participants , i.e. @xmath221 , then there exists an equilibrium of the  in which the payments and utilities are like those of the  with truthful bids .",
    "the following vector of bids will be a nash equilibrium in the game of complete information .",
    "all those who have value greater than @xmath190 bid truthfully , those who have value less than @xmath190 bid @xmath222 .",
    "therefore , all those who are bidding @xmath222 are the losers and will not be assigned anything , and the winners have to pay @xmath222 per unit .",
    "( note that if the last winner is partially using her budget , then @xmath190 is equal to her value , and she has utility @xmath40 .",
    "therefore she has no incentive to increase her bid for depleting the budget of other winners . )",
    "now , we define _ greedy bidding _ , a simple and natural response algorithm for the bidders who are playing the infinitely repeated game without knowing anything about bids and budgets of other bidders .",
    "then we show that the unique equilibrium of greedy bidding coincides with the one described above .",
    "greedy bidding from the perspective of a bidder is defined as follows :    ( greedy bidding )    the bidder executes the following rules in order .    1 .",
    "if what the bidder is paying per unit on average is higher than her value per unit ( her bid is too much above her value ) , she decreases her bid continuously over time . 2 .",
    "if all or part of her budget is left ( trying to deplete the budget of those who are above her , and winning more units ) , she increases her bid continuously over time .",
    "if she is using all her budget ( she can not influence her own price according to the pricing scheme ) , she does not change her bid .    if all the bidders use greedy bidding , the only equilibrium of the game has prices and allocations identical to those of the  with truthful bids , which provides revenue @xmath11 .",
    "first we claim that all losers have the same bid in an equilibrium .",
    "this is because if any of them bids slightly higher , she must be assigned something with a price higher than her value to send her back to her previous bid using rule @xmath15 .",
    "because of pareto - optimality , this can happen only if they all have the same bid .",
    "moreover , this common bid must be the highest possible , otherwise they all can increase their bid . those who have higher value than the common bid of the losers must bid higher than the losers . therefore , the unique solution to this greedy bidding system is when all losers are bidding slightly lower than the and this completes the proof .",
    "we have introduced a new mechanism for multiple units of a single item with individual budgets and valuations , and proved some useful properties . extending the  for multi - item auctions with similar desirable properties",
    "is the most important avenue for further work .",
    "another issue , also considered in @xcite , is the definition of welfare when there are budget constraints .",
    "if we define welfare as sum of the utilities of the bidders , any _ reasonable _ mechanism can be arbitrarily bad with respect to welfare .",
    "suppose that there is a bidder who has budget @xmath40 and has a very large value .",
    "the mechanisms which do not allocate anything to this bidder are unboundedly bad compared to those which do . on the other hand , allocating something to a bidder who has budget @xmath40 , means giving something for free to a bidder !",
    "therefore , we must find another way for measuring welfare rather than comparing it to a situation where all items are given to a bidder for free .",
    "this remains another important direction for future work .",
