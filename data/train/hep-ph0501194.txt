    "quark - hadron duality is a fascinating phenomenon that was first observed by bloom and gilman @xcite more than 30 years ago .",
    "it is receiving plenty of attention today from both the experimentalist @xcite and theorist @xcite communities , due to an interest in duality itself , and due to the huge field of experimental applications of duality in kinematic regions that are very difficult to access without it .",
    "the most straightforward definition of quark - hadron duality says that any hadronic process can be described in terms of either a quark and gluon picture , or in terms of a purely hadronic picture , provided either calculation contains all fock states .",
    "however , in the former case , a full numerical solution of qcd is prohibitive in most situations , despite the impressive progress of lattice qcd , and in the latter case , a full hadronic solution , e.g. employing an effective field theory , also is not feasible unless the kinematic region is restricted to low energies and momenta .",
    "thus , this most general version of duality is not very useful , as many interesting processes take place in a region that is neither perturbative nor very low energy .",
    "there is a much more practical version of duality : in certain kinematic regimes , properly averaged hadronic observables can be described by a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculation .",
    "this version of duality is highly relevant as perturbative qcd calculations can be performed . using duality , these pqcd calculations",
    "can then be related to averaged data taken in the resonance region .",
    "quark - hadron duality has been observed experimentally in many processes : it was discovered by bloom and gilman in inclusive , inelastic electron scattering , it made its way into the textbooks in @xmath1 , was studied in the semileptonic decays of heavy mesons @xcite , is considered in the analysis of heavy ion reactions @xcite , and forms the basis for using qcd sum rules @xcite . in addition to the `` classical '' examples and applications of duality , duality ideas are applied in new areas , too .",
    "for neutrino scattering , the beam energies are not well known , and an averaging will thus take place almost automatically .",
    "the application of duality is discussed for several planned neutrino experiments , see e.g. @xcite , and duality ideas have been applied in @xcite to nucleon / nuclear duality in neutrino scattering . there is also interest in duality in parity violation experiments @xcite , and with regard to generalized parton distributions @xcite . a very local version of duality - assuming that it holds for just one resonance - has been used in @xcite to extract information on structure functions at @xmath0 in the scaling limit from form factor data .",
    "these ideas were also applied to neutrino - nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "duality ideas might also be useful for pion photoproduction @xcite .",
    "duality is a major point in the 12 gev upgrade of cebaf at jefferson lab @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate duality in inclusive , inelastic electron scattering . new experimental data from jefferson lab and desy have impressively confirmed that quark - hadron duality is valid down to rather low four - momentum transfers , and for many observables : duality in @xmath2 was confirmed to hold down to @xmath3 @xcite , and very recently , the longitudinal structure function @xmath4 and the purely transverse @xmath5 were separated , and found to exhibit duality for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for duality in spin observables has been reported for @xmath7 from hermes @xcite and from jefferson lab @xcite for the first moment of @xmath8 .",
    "while this is exciting all by itself , these data have inspired experimentalists to apply duality to the extraction of information on the deep inelastic region in kinematics that are not readily accessible .",
    "duality allows us to connect the perturbative regime of quarks and gluons with the strongly non - perturbative resonance regime .",
    "the earliest example discussed was the extraction of the elastic nucleon form factor from the deep inelastic scaling curve @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "higher twist contributions were inferred from the resonance data .",
    "these two kinematical regions have traditionally been separated , as it was believed that the physics of quarks and gluons had little connection to the collective phenomena of resonances . at low invariant masses",
    "@xmath9 of the final state in an @xmath10 reaction on the nucleon , one observes many resonance bumps in the cross section , and @xmath11 is traditionally referred to as the resonance region . for higher invariant masses , @xmath12 ,",
    "the cross section becomes smooth and exhibits bjorken scaling , and this region is referred to as the deep inelastic region .",
    "note that this strict division of kinematics was introduced historically , even though non - resonant processes are present for low @xmath9 , and resonances with larger mass may contribute for high @xmath9 .",
    "the demarcation line of @xmath13 is plotted in the @xmath14 - @xmath15 plane in fig .",
    "[ kinplot ] .     and @xmath15 kinematic plane .",
    "this kinematic plot shows the deep inelastic regime and the resonance regime .",
    "the solid line corresponds to an invariant mass of the final state of @xmath13 .",
    "every point above the line lies in the resonance region , @xmath16 , and every point below the line lies in the deep inelastic region @xmath12 .",
    "the invariant mass of the final state , @xmath9 , is related to the four momentum transfer @xmath15 and bjorken @xmath14 by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the nucleon mass . ]",
    "one consequence of this traditional subdivision is that large amounts of data with @xmath11 were cut from deep inelastic analyses of data , leading to a paucity of data at very high bjorken @xmath14 .",
    "the region of large @xmath14 , @xmath0 , is referred to as the ( deep ) valence region , and is the subject of much interest . in particular",
    ", one would like to study the valence quark spin distribution of the nucleon .",
    "this can be achieved by measuring the polarization asymmetry @xmath19 of the proton and neutron . for @xmath0 ,",
    "many , and widely different predictions , exist for the polarization asymmetry of the neutron , running the gamut from @xmath20 , predicted in unbroken su(6 ) , to @xmath21 , predicted in pqcd , and everything in between , see @xcite for good reviews of the situation . in the chiral soliton model ,",
    "there are even predictions of negative values @xcite .    the experimental data available for @xmath22 at high @xmath14 was rather scarce and afflicted with very large error bars for @xmath23 before the advent of the recent jefferson lab data @xcite .",
    "they also extended only up to @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this is due not only to the fact that polarization experiments are always more difficult to perform than unpolarized measurements , but mainly due to the fact that in order to achieve @xmath0 for the deep inelastic regime , one has to use very high four - momentum transfers @xmath15 , see fig .",
    "[ kinplot ] .",
    "this drastically reduces the cross section , as the cross section is proportional to the mott cross section , which in turn is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "thus , accessing one and the same @xmath14 in the resonance region and in the deep inelastic regime leads to much lower count rates in the deep inelastic regime .",
    "for example , a measurement at @xmath26 can be performed at @xmath27 in the resonance region , or at @xmath28 in the deep inelastic region .",
    "the count rate in the deep inelastic region will be lowered by more than a factor of 50 compared to the resonance region measurement .",
    "this makes taking data in the deep inelastic regime for large @xmath14 extremely difficult .",
    "a recent jefferson lab experiment improved the situation by measuring in the deep inelastic regime , up to @xmath29 with very reasonable error bars , thus decreasing the uncertainty by an order of magnitude compared to older data @xcite .",
    "still , the experimental exploration of @xmath22 at really large @xmath0 has not been feasible yet , thus making it the prime application for duality .",
    "even with the planned 12 gev upgrade of jefferson lab , data in the deep inelastic regime will be accessible only up to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "as the kinematics plot shows , large values of @xmath14 can be accessed at low @xmath15 in the resonance regime",
    ". a measurement of @xmath22 - or any other observable of interest - in the resonance region can then be averaged , and will yield the same information as a direct measurement in the deep inelastic region , provided that duality holds . using this approach ,",
    "@xmath22 could be measured up to @xmath31 , by taking data in the delta resonance region @xcite .",
    "another interesting application of duality that was recently discussed is the application of duality to the emc effect @xcite .",
    "even though the emc effect has been mapped out for a large kinematic region , data at very high @xmath14 and for lighter nuclei are scarce .",
    "the data base could be significantly expanded by the application of duality to lepton scattering from nuclei .",
    "before we can embark on this new experimental approach , we need a good , solid understanding of how well duality holds , and where it holds .",
    "ideally , one would come up with a certain accuracy of the duality procedure , which then could be quoted as a systematic error for the extraction of @xmath22 or other observables in the relevant region . here , we need more theoretical input and guidance . as we currently do not understand quark - hadron duality from first principles ,",
    "modeling is our best tool to obtain the answers necessary for applying duality to extract @xmath22 .",
    "currently , theorists tackle this problem by modeling duality in two different ways : one branch starts out from the non - relativistic constituent quark model , with some relativistic corrections , to describe duality @xcite , the other branch starts the modeling with a relativistic one - body equation @xcite .",
    "the former branch makes contact with the phenomenology .",
    "it was started by the pioneering work of close and isgur @xcite , where the authors investigated how a summation over the appropriate sets of nucleon resonances leads to parton model results for the structure function ratios in the su(6 ) symmetric quark model .",
    "this work was recently expanded @xcite to include the effects of su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry breaking . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered the first five low - lying resonances , and performed a careful analysis of the onset of duality for @xmath2 and @xmath32 .",
    "our results belong to the latter branch .",
    "the goal of these modeling efforts is obvious : to gain an understanding of quark - hadron duality and the conditions under which it holds , by capturing just the essential physical conditions of this rather complex phenomenon .",
    "we imposed these basic requirements for a model : we require a relativistic description of confined valence quarks , and we treat the hadrons in the infinitely narrow resonance approximation .",
    "this paper is the fourth in a series of papers , in which we have modeled duality with increasing complexity .",
    "all models that we have presented so far have reproduced the features of duality in a qualitative manner .",
    "we started out with an all scalar model @xcite , and gradually improved the model until all the particles had proper spin @xcite . in @xcite , we focused on the model results for the unpolarized responses .",
    "for the first time , we investigated the dependence of our results on the type of potential we employed . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the spin observables : the responses @xmath33 and @xmath34 that are accessible only with spin , the spin structure functions @xmath32 and @xmath35 , and the polarization asymmetries @xmath19 and @xmath36 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ secmodel ] , we briefly state the properties of the model , then , in section [ secformalism ] , we discuss some of the formalism for polarized inclusive electron scattering . in section [ secresults ]",
    "we discuss our numerical results for the various spin observables for the bound - free and the bound - bound transitions .",
    "we end with a brief summary of our results and an outlook .",
    "we use the same model as in @xcite . for the convenience of the reader , we present the key ingredients of our model here .",
    "our model consists of a constituent quark bound to an infinitely heavy di - quark and is represented by the dirac hamiltonian @xmath37 where the scalar potential is a linear confining potential given by @xmath38 we have used the constituent quark mass in this paper , as our main interest is the study of quark - hadron duality , which sets in at rather low @xmath15 , experimentally @xmath39 is enough . in this kinematic region ,",
    "the appropriate degree of freedom is the constituent quark , which has acquired mass through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we have used a value for the quark mass of @xmath40 - obtained previously in a fit to heavy mesons @xcite . however , nothing hinges on using that particular value : we changed our quark mass to @xmath41 , in order to have a value reminiscent of a current quark mass , and repeated our calculations .",
    "it turns out that , while scaling does set in a little faster , there are no qualitative changes in the results .    in our model , the vector potential is provided by a vector color coulomb potential .",
    "calculations will be presented where the vector color coulomb potential is absent , that is @xmath42 , where the vector potential is the simple static coulomb potential @xmath43 with @xmath44 and where the color coulomb potential is corrected to allow for the running coupling constant in a manner similar to that used by godfrey and isgur @xcite .",
    "the vector potential then has the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 note that we use different scalar and vector potentials , in contrast to @xcite , where @xmath47 is used to simplify the calculations .",
    "we assume that only the light quark carries a charge , and we choose unit charge for the light quark for simplicity .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the formalism for calculating responses for targets with arbitrary polarization axes , and connect the definitions of the polarization asymmetries @xmath48 and the spin structure functions @xmath49 to the responses .",
    "the hadronic tensor for targets with an arbitrary polarization axis in @xmath50 direction is : @xmath51 with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the electromagnetic current operator .",
    "the ground state s z - component of @xmath54 is denoted @xmath55 instead of @xmath56 for brevity .",
    "components of the hadronic tensor can be combined to give @xmath57 the cross section for electron helicity @xmath58 and target polarization axis @xmath50 can be expressed in terms of the hadronic tensor and the leptonic coefficients @xmath59 as @xmath60 \\right ) \\label{crossec}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the mott cross section , @xmath62 is the three - momentum transfer from the electron to the target , @xmath63 is the energy transfer and @xmath64 , and @xmath58 denotes the electron helicity .",
    "the leptonic coefficients are given by @xcite @xmath65    for arbitrary target spin , all six combinations of the hadronic tensor are non - zero . however , for spin @xmath66 targets , only four combinations contribute : @xmath67 and @xmath68 . inserting the results for the current matrix elements , and exploiting selection rules and symmetry relations between various current matrix elements ,",
    "one finds for our case @xmath69 explicitly carrying out the summation over the initial spin @xmath55 for the @xmath68 and @xmath70 combinations , and substituting for the hadronic tensor combinations in the expression for the cross section eq .",

    "now we can relate this cross section to the definition of the polarization observables .",
    "the polarization asymmetry @xmath74 is defined as the ratio of the difference and sum of the cross sections for longitudinally polarized electrons and target polarization parallel or anti - parallel to the beam , see e.g. @xcite : @xmath75 / \\left [ \\frac{d \\sigma^{\\to \\atop \\leftarrow}}{d e ' d \\omega ' } + \\frac{d \\sigma^{\\to \\atop \\to}}{d e ' d \\omega ' } \\right ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{defapar}\\ ] ] the upper superscript denotes the direction of the electron polarization , the lower superscript indicates the direction of the target polarization .",
    "the relevant cross sections are obtained by using @xmath76 in each case and @xmath50 and @xmath77 for the target polarizations parallel and antiparallel to the beam . using the conventional coordinate system",
    ", this means that the target is polarized in the @xmath78 plane , see e.g. @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the angle between transferred momentum @xmath81 and beam momentum @xmath82 : @xmath83 . substituting and rearranging now",
    "yield : @xmath84 now , we compare this expression to the definition of the polarization asymmetries @xmath48 . for the convenience of the reader , we quote the standard definitions @xcite : @xmath85 with the depolarization factor @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and @xmath90 with the magnitude of the virutal photon s longitudinal polarization , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "note that the @xmath93 defined here is not the @xmath93-variable used in the next section .",
    "thus , we can read off the expressions for the polarization asymmetries in terms of response functions from eq .",
    "( [ apares ] ) as @xmath94 where we used the symmetry of the current matrix elements and the definitions for the responses @xcite : @xmath95 the symbol @xmath96 indicates the average over initial states and the sum over final states .",

    "we find : @xmath99 summarizing our expressions for the polarization observables in terms of response functions , we have @xmath100    for completeness , we also quote the expressions for the unpolarized structure functions @xmath101 and @xmath102 in terms of the responses : @xmath103 and @xmath104    we focused on the longitudinal and transverse response functions in our last paper @xcite , and we now focus on the true spin observables , which we can now calculate , as quark spin is included in our present model .",
    "the dirac wave functions and energy eigenvalues are obtained by integrating the dirac equation using the runge - kutta - feldberg technique and solutions are obtained for energies up to 12 gev with the radial quantum number of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    in our model",
    ", we excite the bound quark from the ground state to higher energy states , and do not allow it to decay .",
    "we refer to this process as the bound - bound transition ( previously , in @xcite , we referred ot it as fsi ) .",
    "thus , we do not include any particle production in our model , and are strictly quantum - mechanical in this sense .",
    "we do not have any gluons in our model , either , which means that we do not encounter any radiative corrections .",
    "since the response functions consist of a sum of delta functions , we choose to smear out the response functions by folding with a narrow gaussian for purposes of visualization .",
    "the smeared response functions are then given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 stands for @xmath109 or @xmath70 .    before presenting numerical results , we would like to remind our readers that , while the present model is more realistic than its predecessors , its results should not be compared _",
    "quantitatively _ to inclusive electron scattering from a nucleon . due to the assumption of an infinitely heavy antiquark ( or diquark ) to which the light quark is bound",
    ", our calculation most resembles inclusive electron scattering from a b - meson , which has never been measured .",
    "the goal of our work is to gain a qualitative understanding of duality , and the current simplification is no impediment to this .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the current matrix elements naturally are functions of the three - momentum transfer @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to show our results for fixed three - momentum transfer @xmath110 as a function of the @xmath93-scaling variable    @xmath111    the physics are not affected by presenting our results in this fashion .",
    "in fact , later on we will explicitly compare our results plotted for fixed @xmath110 and @xmath93 to our results plotted for fixed four - momentum transfer @xmath15 and the appropriate @xmath112 scaling variable .    in the following , we will present analytic and numerical results for the bound - free and bound - bound transitions , and we investigate if duality holds or not .",
    "the conditions that need to be fulfilled to see duality are : scaling of the bound - bound transition and bound - free transition to the same scaling curve , and oscillation of the bound - bound results at low momentum transfer around the scaling curve .",
    "we are going to check if our model results qualitatively reproduce the signature of duality as seen in the electron scattering data .    in each case",
    ", we will investigate the approach to scaling for the different observables , the scaling curves themselves , and the behavior at low momentum transfers .",
    "now , we turn to the numerical results of our model calculations . within our model , we calculate two different processes : the bound - bound transition and the bound - free transition of the light quark . the bound - free transition ( referred to as pwia in @xcite ) , is the analog to perturbative qcd .",
    "the bound quark is knocked into the continuum by the absorption of the virtual photon .",
    "we discuss the bound - free transition first , employing just the linear confining potential .",
    "we investigate the scaling results and the onset of scaling for the bound - free transition .",
    "next , in section [ secbb ] , we show our results for the bound - bound transition and the linear confining potential .",
    "there , we focus on the onset of scaling and the low-@xmath110 duality . then , we take a look at the role of the ground state p - wave contribution in section [ secpwave ] . finally , we investigate the effect of employing a static coulomb and a running coulomb potential in section [ secpotmodels ] .      for the bound - free transition , we can reach arbitrarily high energy transfers without any numerical complications , as we do not have to solve for any high energy bound states in the final state .",

    "<S> we apply a model for the study of quark - hadron duality in inclusive electron scattering to the calculation of spin observables . the model is based on solving the dirac equation numerically for a scalar confining linear potential and a vector color coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> we qualitatively reproduce the features of quark - hadron duality for all potentials considered , and discuss the onset of scaling and duality for the responses , spin structure functions , and polarization asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> duality may be applied to gain access to kinematic regions which are hard to access in deep inelastic scattering , namely for @xmath0 , and we discuss which observables are most suitable for this application of duality .    </S>",
