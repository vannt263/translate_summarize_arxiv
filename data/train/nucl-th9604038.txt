    "few - body interactions of the @xmath0 meson may complement our knowledge on the @xmath0-nucleon interaction . of related interest is the possibility of @xmath0-nuclear quasi - bound states .",
    "such states have been predicted by haider and liu @xcite and li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , when it was realised that the @xmath0-nucleon interaction is attractive . in few - nucleon systems these states",
    "are expected to be narrow , and thus easier to detect .",
    "so far there has been no direct experimental verification of this hypothesis . on the other hand ,",
    "wilkin @xcite has suggested that an indirect effect of such a state is seen in the rapid slope of the @xmath1he amplitude detected just above the @xmath0 production threshold @xcite .",
    "another indication of the strong three - body @xmath2 correlations follows from the recent measurement of @xmath3 cross sections in the threshold region @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-deuteron is the easiest few - body system to describe . in this letter",
    "a simple formula is given to provide the @xmath4 scattering matrix at energies below the deuteron breakup .",
    "detailed calculations are done for the scattering length @xmath5 , where the @xmath0-nucleon scattering length @xmath6 is considered as an input . in the limiting case of fixed nucleons ,",
    "this formula is found to be consistent with earlier calculations of ref .",
    "however , our model includes corrections involving effects of the continuum in the @xmath7 system , which are found to be necessary .    for large values of re @xmath6 in the region of 0.7 to 1.0 fm ,",
    "suggested by some models , we find the @xmath4 system to be close to binding",
    ". in this region @xmath5 becomes large and depends on details of the @xmath8 interaction model .",
    "in particular one finds strong dependence on the way the @xmath8 scattering matrix is extrapolated to the region below the threshold .",
    "if the actual @xmath9 turns out to be sizable , it will be detected from the analysis of the final state interactions in the @xmath10 scattering experiment performed at celsius recently @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to derive a simple formula that relates the low - energy meson - deuteron scattering amplitude to the meson - nucleon scattering length .",
    "the former is found by summation of a multiple scattering series and is expressed in terms of a few basic multiple scattering integrals . in order to motivate the method we recall a simple formula for the scattering length of a meson on a pair of fixed nucleons @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath6 is the meson - nucleon scattering length and @xmath12 is the nucleon - nucleon distance .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) is obtained in a simple way by setting a boundary condition for the meson wave function @xmath13 at each scatterer @xmath14 . in the simplest version of genuinely fixed scatterers @xmath15 , but a simple correction @xmath16 is easy to implement . here , the meson - deuteron reduced mass @xmath17 corrects for the meson propagator ( @xmath18 ) , which has to be referred to the @xmath19 centre of mass system .",
    "the reduced meson - nucleon mass @xmath20 is necessary to relate the meson - nucleon scattering lengths to the meson - nucleon potentials .",
    "already at this stage eq . ( [ f1 ] ) is a fair representation of @xmath5 for re @xmath6 of about 0.3 fm or less . in principle",
    "it handles also situations of @xmath21 , i.e. the cases of meson - deuteron bound or virtual states close to threshold .",
    "the latter may occur already at re @xmath22 fm , which is close to the range of the @xmath0-nucleon scattering lengths allowed by some models @xcite .",
    "however , for such large re @xmath6 eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) becomes rather inaccurate . in the rest of this section",
    "we find necessary corrections , determine the virtual or quasibound state singularities and discuss other related calculations of @xmath5 .",
    "let us begin with a multiple scattering expansion that follows from the three - body faddeev equations for a meson interacting with a pair of nucleons labeled 1,2 .",
    "for the situation of meson - deuteron scattering below the deuteron breakup , the series for the @xmath0-deuteron @xmath23-matrix is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a meson - nucleon scattering matrix , @xmath26 is the free three - body propagator and @xmath27 is that part of the three - body propagator which contains the nucleon - nucleon scattering matrix @xmath28 .",
    "this expansion is performed in momentum space and appropriate integrations over the intermediate momenta are understood .",
    "the detailed notation and normalisation will be given later .",
    "now the partial summation of the series for the scattering amplitude is performed .",
    "the latter is determined by an average @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the deuteron and @xmath31 is the free - meson @xmath32-wave function in the relative meson - deuteron momentum variables .",
    "we define the @xmath4 scattering length as @xmath33 a partial summation of the series  ( [ f2 ] ) for @xmath34 is obtained by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the impulse approximation and @xmath37 @xmath38 this partial sum is already equivalent to formula ( [ f1 ] ) as it contains terms of the order @xmath39 in the denominator .",
    "the expansion parameter @xmath40 does not need to be small to guarantee the success of eq .",
    "( [ f5 ] ) , which works even for @xmath41 , when the multiple scattering is divergent",
    ". in the @xmath4 case @xmath42 falls into the 0.10.3 range .",
    "corrections for higher orders of @xmath40 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ f5 ] ) may be obtained by comparing higher orders in eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) with a series expansion of eq .",
    "( [ f5 ] ) with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in this way",
    "the next approximation is obtained @xmath45-[\\sigma_2-(\\sigma_1)^2 ] -[\\delta_2-\\omega_1\\sigma_1]}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48    this procedure may be continued into a systematic method to include higher powers of @xmath40 in the denominator .",
    "the main advantage is a strong cancellation in the @xmath49 term and also higher order @xmath50 terms , as was demonstrated in the optical model calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite for he nuclei . as we show numerically in the next section ,",
    "also for the @xmath0-deuteron system there is a strong cancellation in the second ( and indeed also in the higher orders ) term of the partial sum ( [ f7 ] ) .",
    "this causes the method to converge much more rapidly than the direct @xmath51 series .    before going further we write down and",
    "discuss the basic quantities entering this formalism .",
    "momentum variables are used everywhere .",
    "these are the momenta canonical to the jacobi coordinates , @xmath52 the relative @xmath19 momentum , @xmath53 the relative @xmath54 momentum , and the corresponding variables for the other possible pairs like ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the normalisation is chosen so that a `` volume '' element is @xmath56 , the propagator @xmath57 and the scattering matrices are @xmath58 , i.e. they conserve the spectator momentum .",
    "the @xmath59 are normalised in such a way that @xmath60 with the standard convention i m @xmath61 . later , a separable form @xmath62 is used with a yamaguchi formfactor @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath19 scattering matrix @xmath64 is normalised with a different ( standard ) sign convention that requires @xmath65 also here a yamaguchi separable form is used with @xmath66 @xmath67 and the strength fitted to reproduce the deuteron binding energy , the scattering length @xmath68 fm .",
    "calculation of the multiple scattering integrals is straightforward although tedious and the formulae are lengthy . for simplicity",
    "we reproduce a few dominant quantities in the zero meson momentum and zero range @xmath0-nucleon force limit , although actual calculations are performed also taking into account a finite force range .",
    "then the impulse approximation term becomes @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the scattering matrix averaged over some energy region , generated by the recoil of the spectator nucleon .",
    "the range of the latter is given by the fourier transform of the deuteron wave function @xmath71 . in a more general nonzero meson momentum case",
    "the average is given by the momentum distribution of the @xmath8 pair .",
    "the quantity of interest is the scattering length at threshold @xmath5 .",
    "hence , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the deuteron binding energy , and the energies in eq .",
    "( [ f12 ] ) extend down to the subthreshold region .",
    "this means an extrapolation into the unphysical region by a few mev .",
    "therefore , a model is required for this extrapolation and some possibilities are discussed later . in general , due to the short range of @xmath8 forces , the absence of nearby singularities or an @xmath8 quasi - bound state , the energy dependence of @xmath74 in the narrow subthreshold region is apparently smooth . in all multiple scattering integrals of interest",
    "the average value @xmath75 is used . in this way",
    "the dominant term @xmath43 becomes @xmath76 ^ 2 \\equiv 2 \\bar{a}_{\\eta n } \\ , \\sigma_1\\ ] ] with @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the yamaguchi formfactor for the @xmath19 separable potential . in the low energy region",
    "the @xmath28 matrix is dominated by the deuteron pole . for @xmath72 , the integration in eq .",
    "( [ f13 ] ) extends from the pole down to negative energies .",
    "when @xmath28 is limited to the pole term , and the @xmath19 recoil energy @xmath79 is neglected in eq .",
    "( [ f14 ] ) , expression ( [ f13 ] ) reduces to a simple form @xmath80 with a clear physical interpretation .",
    "the higher order terms for @xmath50 have the same structure corresponding to @xmath81 scatterings on the optical potential @xmath82 at zero incident energy .",
    "similarly to refs . @xcite it can be expected that the series for @xmath83 converges so rapidly that @xmath84 would be precise on the 1% level even in the case of a bound state at threshold .",
    "indeed , the effectiveness of this expansion is confirmed in table i for two particular values of the @xmath8 scattering lengths and an @xmath8 formfactor allowing comparison with the calculation of @xcite . the latter one uses",
    "a rather involved set of integral equations for the @xmath0 scattering on fixed nucleons corrected later for the effect of the deuteron wave functions , but no allowance is made for a free @xmath85 spectrum in the intermediate states .",
    "this assumption would correspond to our model with @xmath86 .",
    "the agreement between these two calculations is rather good , with small differences probably due to two factors : first , gaussian wave functions are used in ref .",
    "@xcite , while ours come naturally in the hulthen form ; second , the @xmath28 used here contains more than the deuteron pole .",
    "the effect of the free three - body spectrum in the intermediate states is still missing .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath6 it is given by the @xmath44 term of eq .",
    "( [ f6 ] ) . within the average @xmath87 approximation it becomes @xmath88",
    "this quantity is real below the deuteron breakup , which is the region of our interest . in a similar way one obtains higher order terms @xmath89",
    "etc . , which are also real in this region .",
    "now , the final formula to be used in the applications is presented as @xmath90},\\ ] ] where the second order terms are defined in analogy to eqs .",
    "( [ f13 ] , [ f16 ] ) , i.e. @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the numerical factors 1 , 2 and 4 in eq .",
    "( [ f17 ] ) arise from the number of independent collisions on the successive nucleons .",
    "numerical results for the scattering length are given in the next section . before presenting these",
    "let us discuss the question of the unitarity of @xmath93 , when it is calculated for finite meson energies , but below the deuteron breakup threshold .",
    "imaginary contributions to @xmath94 arise only above the deuteron breakup , but the absorptive parts of @xmath95 begin already at @xmath96 .",
    "these are generated by the deuteron pole in @xmath97 in the integral ( [ f13 ] ) for @xmath98 and in similar formulas for the higher order @xmath95 . at @xmath99 ,",
    "the pole term of @xmath100 contributes the @xmath101 term to expression ( [ f15 ] ) in the coordinate representation . for higher energies",
    "the meson propagator becomes @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the incident meson momentum .",
    "hence for small momenta we have i m @xmath104 .",
    "in addition the second term @xmath105 generates no terms linear in @xmath103 as may be seen from eq .",
    "( [ f15 ] ) and its second order analog .",
    "this allows us to present the low energy behaviour of @xmath106 as @xmath107^{-1}\\ ] ] as required by unitarity .",
    "it also permits the use of the series summation method in some energy region close to the threshold .",
    "the formula for the meson - deuteron scattering length @xmath5 expresses it in terms of an `` effective @xmath0-nucleon scattering length '' @xmath87 , which is an average of the @xmath8 scattering matrix extrapolated by a few mev below the threshold .",
    "this is our input parameter .",
    "inherently there is another parameter , the inverse range @xmath108 in the @xmath8 form factor , included in the calculated quantities multiplying powers of the @xmath87 in the expansion ( [ f17 ] ) for the inverse @xmath109 .",
    "these follow from the three - body interactions , and they are given in table ii for four representative values of @xmath108 from the literature @xcite , which presumably cover the whole range of allowed values .",
    "it follows from this table that the coefficients of the @xmath110 order are very small .",
    "the second order terms @xmath111 due to the intermediate @xmath19 interactions have been found to be small already in the optical model calculations of @xmath0he scattering @xcite .",
    "higher order terms are negligible as may be seen from the results of table i.    as shown in table i the static nucleon approximation is not adequate in the region of large re @xmath112 close to the critical values .",
    "the effect of the @xmath19 continuum is significant .",
    "some care is needed with calculations of the corresponding scattering integrals in the three - body continuum @xmath94 .",
    "these converge slowly and depend strongly on the range of the @xmath8 interaction . in particular , the zero range limit can not be taken for @xmath113 and higher orders .",
    "provided an unphysical value @xmath114 is not used to describe the free - spectrum contributions , the small weight and the cancellations in @xmath115 reduce effects of the continuum to the @xmath116 term .",
    "a similar cancellation happens in the `` mixed term '' @xmath117 which , although small , dominates the second order term .",
    "all this allows the simple formula ( [ f17 ] ) to work very effectively even under the demanding condition of a nearby singularity .    in table",
    "iii one finds values of @xmath5 for a number of @xmath8 scattering lengths that follow from several analyses of the combined @xmath118 coupled channels and from @xmath0 photoproduction data .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 may vary by an order of magnitude , reflecting a nearby @xmath4 quasibound state that may arise at threshold for re @xmath6 close to 0.8 fm .",
    "it is also clear that the results depend on the extrapolation of @xmath119 below the threshold .",
    "no detailed models are available in this region and two simple approaches have been attempted : + ( 1 ) a constant @xmath6 and + ( 2 ) a typical low - energy form @xmath120 as required by unitarity .",
    "+ in the latter case the calculations are done using an imaginary @xmath121 .",
    "this value follows from the average value of the subthreshold energy argument @xmath122 involved in eq .",
    "( [ f12 ] ) , ( the recoil energy amounts to some 4 mev ) .",
    "such an extrapolation reduces the effective values of re  @xmath123 by @xmath124 as compared to the threshold re  @xmath125 values .",
    "the sensitivity on this extrapolation method is due to the nearby singularity .",
    "this singularity may represent a quasi - bound @xmath4 state , if re @xmath126 , or a quasi - virtual @xmath4 state , if re @xmath127 .",
    "a more systematic study of @xmath5 is presented in figs . 1 and 2 , where plots of i m  @xmath128 and re  @xmath128 are given for two typical values of i m  @xmath6 as functions re  @xmath6 .",
    "these are all calculated for @xmath129 @xmath67 and for the two low energy presentations of @xmath130 .",
    "it is seen that the critical value of re  @xmath6 , when the virtual state is formed at the @xmath4 threshold and crosses - over to the quasi - bound state is about 0.8 fm .",
    "that is well within the range of expected values .",
    "if this happens , one may observe very strong effects in the final state @xmath4 interactions .",
    "these may be seen in @xmath10 scattering experiments , if relative @xmath4 momenta as small as 10 - 60 mev / c are measured .",
    "we have applied a multiple scattering series formalism developed earlier for the @xmath0-helium system to calculate the @xmath0-deuteron scattering length .",
    "\\a ) it is possible to sum effectively the multiple scattering series for the inverse meson - deuteron scattering matrix below the breakup threshold .",
    "the method has the advantage of being able to incorporate both the influence of @xmath19 scattering and the free three - body intermediate continuum in a relatively simple but numerically stable way without resorting to exact faddeev equations .",
    "\\b ) for small values of re  @xmath131 fm the fixed nucleons make a good approximation . for larger values of re",
    "@xmath112 it is necessary to take into account the intermediate three - body continuum states .",
    "the sensitivity to otherwise small effects is due to the proximity of an @xmath4 quasibound state .",
    "for the same reason the @xmath4 scattering length is fairly sensitive to the subthreshold extrapolation of the @xmath8 scattering matrix .",
