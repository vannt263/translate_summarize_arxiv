    "in january 2004 , j.w . mcneil discovered a new reflection nebula in the dark cloud lynds 1630 near m 78 @xcite this object , now known as mcneil s nebula , is apparently associated with an exor - type eruption @xcite of the embedded protostar v1647 ori .",
    "exors belong to the class of pre - main - sequence optical variables @xcite .",
    "they are classical t tau stars which undergo irregular outbursts in the optical / uv of several magnitudes , named for the prototype ex lup @xcite .",
    "these outbursts are interpreted as episodes of substantial mass transfer resulting from instabilities in the accretion disk ; they are present very early in the evolution of a protostar , as shown by the detection of exor outbursts from deeply embedded class 1 protostars in the serpens star formation region @xcite .",
    "@xcite first identified v1647 ori as the young stellar object iras 05436 - 0007 on the basis of its iras colors .",
    "i - band and [ sii ] narrow - band imaging of the region by @xcite revealed a faint i band source at the position of the iras object and reflection nebulosity extending to the north , identifying v1647 ori as the likely driver for hh 23 , located 170 arcsec north of the star .",
    "the bolometric flux of the source derived from iras and sub - millimeter photometry by @xcite yields a luminosity of 2.7 @xmath0 and an inferred molecular gas mass of 0.4 @xmath1 assuming a distance of 400 pc to the orion star - forming complex @xcite .",
    "estimates of the extinction towards v1647 ori , @xmath2 = @xmath3 - @xmath4 , are found to be similar from photometry taken during the quiescent phase ( abraham et al .",
    "2004 ) and during the eruptive phase ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ; vacca et al . 2004",
    "; briceo et al . 2004 ; andrews , rothberg & simon 2004 ) .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether the appearance of mcneil s nebula is due only to the eruption of v1647 ori or to the eruption plus additional clearing of obscuring circumstellar dust . in this paper",
    ", we examine this question using pre - eruption multiband optical and near infrared data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) compared with post - eruption data in the sdss and 2mass bands observed at the united states naval observatory .",
    "we detect the protostar at four epochs of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) imaging as a point source ( sdss j054613.14 - 000604.1 ) coincident with the 2mass @xmath5-band position ( @xmath6=05@xmath746@xmath813.1@xmath9 , @xmath10=-00@xmath1106@xmath1205@xmath13 ) .",
    "the sdss observations consist of two pairs of scans acquired in november 1998 and february 2002 .",
    "figure [ fig - detail ] shows an sdss composite image made with the @xmath14 filters in which the protostar and the faint nebulosity to the north can be seen .",
    "a technical summary of the sdss is given by @xcite .",
    "the sdss imaging camera is described by @xcite .",
    "the early data release and the data release one are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former includes an extensive discussion of the data outputs and software .",
    "@xcite describe the astrometric calibration of the survey and the network of primary photometric standard stars is described by @xcite .",
    "the photometric system itself is defined by @xcite , and the system which monitors the site photometricity by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the differences between the native sdss 2.5 m @xmath15 system and the @xmath16 standard star system defined on the usno 1.0 m @xcite .",
    "the sdss low galactic latitude data which includes the orion equatorial imaging used in this work are described by @xcite .    the u.s .",
    "naval observatory flagstaff station 1.0 m and 1.55 m telescopes were used to obtain eruptive phase @xmath17 and @xmath18 photometry of v1647 ori . for @xmath17 , frames were taken and flatfielded using twilight sky flats .",
    "daophot psf fitting as implemented in iraf was used to obtain photometric measures of the target since there is a bright part of the nebula only a few arcsec distant . for each dataset",
    ", ensemble differential photometry was performed using a set of secondary standard stars calibrated on two photometric nights with the usno 1.0 m telescope .",
    "the @xmath19 measures were relative to @xmath19 secondary standard stars calibrated by the sdss pt telescope @xcite . for @xmath18 , we used 2mass stars in the field , eliminating obvious variables , to calibrate the data .",
    "we used a standard @xmath5 filter for 2004 february 11 , but used a @xmath20 filter for 2004 april 12 .",
    "the pre - eruptive and recent optical and near - infrared photometry of v1647 ori are summarized in tables [ tbl - photo_opt ] , [ tbl - photo_erupt ] , and [ tbl - photo_nir ] . the quiescent and eruptive phase spectral energy distributions",
    "are shown as @xmath21 in figure [ fig - sed ] .",
    "we examine the evolution of reddening invariant colors from the quiescent to the eruptive states to constrain the underlying physical processes .",
    "these colors take the generic form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the observed magnitudes in each passband .",
    "a color change is computed as @xmath25 , where color changes having @xmath25 statistically distinct from 0 indicate changes in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) not consistent with pure dust clearing . the conversion from @xmath26 to extinction in each band follows @xcite and finkbeiner et al.(2004 ) , _ in preparation _",
    "the reddening invariant colors measured before and during the eruption are listed in table [ tbl - colors ] for both @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the latter appropriate for the larger dust grains found in star formation regions .",
    "@xmath29 , defined as @xmath30 , is the ratio of the general to selective extinction .",
    "characteristic grain sizes are inferred to increase from 0.17 @xmath31 m to 0.21 @xmath31 m as @xmath29 ranges from 3.1 to 5.5 assuming a mix of silicate and carbonaceous populations @xcite . in the coldest portions of the molecular clouds additional grain species such as refractory and volatile organics , olivine , water ice , orthopyroxene , trolite , and metallic iron",
    "are expected to contribute to the opacity @xcite .",
    "@xcite detect absorption due to water ice at 3.1 @xmath31 m in the near - ir outburst spectrum .",
    "study of the selective extinction in background stars has revealed that @xmath29 is not constant within the interiors of dark molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite find that for the bok globule cb 107 @xmath29 increases inwards reaching a value of 6.5 at the core .",
    "given the complex nature of the v1647 ori environment including outburst cavities , accretion disks , and remnant envelopes it is likely that @xmath29 can vary on small spatial scales .      in the foregoing analysis",
    "we choose to characterize the intervening dust in terms of the sdss @xmath24 band extinction and @xmath29 .",
    "since the shape of the extinction curve is dependent upon the grain size distribution for @xmath32 m @xcite the traditional @xmath2 and @xmath26 quantities are sensitive to both the dust column density and @xmath29 . by adopting reference passbands longward of 0.9 @xmath31 m",
    "we remove the dependency on the form of the dust law although @xmath29 must still be considered in the optical and uv .",
    "alternate passbands that are free of @xmath29 effects include the near - ir @xmath33 and johnson - cousins @xmath34 , the latter used by @xcite who adopted @xmath35 @xmath36 for a standard gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite we assume that the quiescent phase near - ir colors are that of an embedded low - mass classical t tauri and obtain @xmath37 = 1.43@xmath8 by dereddening onto the classical t tauri locus of @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 = 3.39@xmath8 ( @xmath39 = 6.40@xmath8 ) given @xmath40 m and @xmath41 m and application of the @xcite methodology .      in order to analyze the general differences between the quiescent and eruptive appearance",
    "we combine sets of observations to form representative values .",
    "the quiescent state is taken as the october 7 ( 2mass @xmath42 ) and the 1998 november 17 ( sdss @xmath43 ) observations .",
    "the optical photometry for the eruptive state is obtained from the 2004 february 14 gemini @xmath44 and @xmath45 data @xcite , and the 2004 february 26 usno @xmath24 band observations .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath5 data for the eruptive state are from the 2004 february 11 usno observations .",
    "table [ tbl - deltas ] presents the reddening invariant colors in the quiescent and eruptive states for @xmath29 = 3.1 and @xmath29 = 5.5 .",
    "as evidenced by the greater than 5@xmath47 change in all colors except for @xmath48 , which has a marginal @xmath44 band detection in the quiescent state , it is clear that the increase in emission is not consistent with a dust clearing event and thus we conclude that an intrinsic change occurred to the sed of v1647 ori .    in figure [ fig - delm ]",
    "we compare the observed magnitude variations against @xmath49 = @xmath50 and @xmath51 dust clearing events and , as concluded above based on reddening invariant colors , find they are not explainable in terms of a simple diminishing of the line of sight extinction .      from observations of class ii protostars ( classical t tauris )",
    "we would expect that the veiling continuum due to magnetospheric accretion will be present in the sdss @xmath52 and @xmath53 bands but weakening into the redder @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath24 bands @xcite . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the thermal emission from the inner portion of the circumstellar disk should be bright in the @xmath54 and @xmath5 bands but diminishing into the bluer @xmath33 band @xcite .",
    "for all but the mostly heavily veiled stars the @xmath45 and @xmath24 bands will only be affected by extinction .",
    "none of the reddening invariant colors can be used to give the intrinsic spectral type .",
    "young ( 1 myr ) t tauri stars exhibit spectral types between m0 and m4 for masses of 0.1 to 1.0 m@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the use of the @xcite near - ir classical t tauri locus by @xcite and @xcite implicitly assumes a similar spectral type as this locus is based on observations of k7/m0 stars in the taurus star formation region .",
    "the @xmath56 colors for these early to mid m spectral types range from 0.38 to 0.80 with considerable scatter on the order of several tenths of magnitudes @xcite . given the observed @xmath56 ( 2.01@xmath570.06 ) , dereddening to these intrinsic colors requires @xmath39 = 3.1@xmath8 to 4.2@xmath8 for @xmath58 and 4.3@xmath8 to 5.7@xmath8 for @xmath28 .",
    "dereddening using the estimated @xmath59 and @xmath29 = 3.1 results in an intrinsic @xmath56 of -0.47 , which is too blue for the stellar locus .",
    "assumption of @xmath29 = 5.5 yields an @xmath56 of 0.20 , corresponding to a late k spectral type @xcite .",
    "if v1647 ori is indeed a low mass protostar with a late k or m spectral type than either @xmath60 is high or significant @xmath45 band veiling is present in the quiescent state .    in figure [ fig - qsed ]",
    "we compare the observed quiescent phase sed against an m0 photosphere seen under an extinction of @xmath39=6.4 magnitudes .",
    "excess emission is seen in the @xmath46 and @xmath5 bands that could indicate the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "the optical spectra acquired during the outburst by @xcite lack the tio molecular absorption bands characteristic of late k and m stars .",
    "@xcite attribute this to either an early photospheric spectral type or overwhelming veiling .",
    "we adopt the latter interpretation given the apparent change to the intrinsic sed and the large brightness increase in the optical ( figure [ fig - delm ] ) .",
    "if the new component to the sed is due to an exor outburst then we expect to see emission from the high temperature ( 6000 - 8000 k ) inner disk @xcite . in figure [ fig - delf ]",
    "we show the observed flux ( @xmath21 ) increase in comparison with a 7000 k blackbody reddened by @xmath39 = 3.2@xmath8 and 6.4@xmath8 for @xmath29 = 3.1 and 5.5 . in common with @xcite",
    "we see that a single exor - like high temperature component can not reproduce the observed excess in both the optical and the near - ir .    for the partial dust clearing events suggested by @xcite and @xcite",
    "we find that due to the increase in optical depth towards the blue the additional flux due to a new source must fall more rapidly at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "the observed change in @xmath61 is -0.61@xmath8 , which if entirely due to dust clearing requires @xmath49 = -3.2@xmath8 .",
    "the intrinsic flux increase required in this case is shown in figure [ fig - delf ] and would require either a lower temperature for the new source or a significantly higher extinction than anticipated .",
    "spectral indices are commonly defined by the ratio of the flux of the feature ( @xmath62 ) and that of the nearby pseudo - continuum ( @xmath63 ) , so the intrinsic measure of the feature strength is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "if a veiling continuum is present , defined by @xmath65 , then the measured spectral index , @xmath34 , is    @xmath66    figure [ fig - veil ] shows the observed depression of the line relative to the continuum level @xmath67 on a logarithmic scale as a function of the veiling , @xmath44 , for unveiled indices of @xmath68 = 0.0 , 0.1 , to 0.9 . from figure [ fig - delm ]",
    "we see that the flux in the @xmath45 band has increased by @xmath69 m = -5 or a factor of @xmath70100 which means the tio features will be visible as less than a 1% fluctuation in the observed continuum .",
    "the observed photometric variations are not consistent with a simple dust clearing event as evidenced by changes in reddening invariant indices .",
    "we infer that the process of eruption involves changes to both the optical and near - ir sed .",
    "application of an inferred pre - outburst extinction of @xmath39 = 6.4@xmath8 suggests a late k spectral type if the @xmath71 and @xmath56 colors are minimally affected by the veiling continuum arising from magnetospheric accretion shocks and that @xmath60 has a value expected for a star formation region . an early to mid",
    "m spectral type is possible if the @xmath45 band includes an excess emission of 0.2@xmath8 to 0.6@xmath8 , corresponding to a veiling between 0.2 and 0.7 .",
    "we interpret the quiescent phase of v1647 ori as an embedded low mass classical t tauri .",
    "comparison with a reddened m0 photosphere shows a near - ir excess that is presumably due to thermal emission from a normal circumstellar disk .",
    "the outburst sed is dominated by the new component .",
    "we see that a single blackbody having the @xmath707000 k temperature expected for an exor inner disk can not simultaneously reproduce both the optical and near - ir portions of the sed .",
    "it is possible , as suggested by @xcite , that a partial dust clearing event occurred in combination with an intrinsic brightening .",
    "we note that a reduction of the line of sight extinction would preferentially lessen the required flux increase at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this steepening of the curve shown in figure [ fig - delf ] would increase the difficulty of fitting the high temperature ( b spectral type ) component observed by @xcite .",
