    "<S> to further our understanding , we have complemented the atomistic calculations with an effective mass ( em ) based analytic model with rashba and dresselhaus - like soi terms [ supplementary section s1 ] , as used in earlier works @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it is clear from these expressions that to match @xmath4 the difference in soi and dipole moment parameters between the valley states are relevant ( but not their absolute values ) . </S>",

    "<S> 1c and 2a ( cyan solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the atomistic tb calculations , we include no new fitting parameters and the effects of soi and @xmath26 are intertwined by the effects of interface steps , electric field , and dot size .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figs .  1 and 2 , three physical attributes play a key role in explaining the experimental data , 1 ) soi , 2 ) @xmath24 , and 3 ) @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> each of these contribute to @xmath52 , and only their sum can accurately reproduce the experimental data for a specific interface condition and vertical electric field , the two knobs mentioned in earlier paragraph . in figs .  3 and 4 , </S>",
    "<S> we show separately the effects of 1 ) and 3 ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the contributions of soi and @xmath26 are modulated by the nature of the confining interface ( knob 2 ) . </S>",

    "<S> both @xmath2 and @xmath3 show a 180@xmath53 periodicity but they are 90@xmath53 out of phase . from analytic effective mass study [ supplementary equation s11 ] , we understand that the anisotropic contribution from the dresselhaus - like interaction , caused by interface inversion asymmetry@xcite , results in this angular dependence in @xmath52 . moreover , the different signs of the dresselhaus coefficients @xmath39 for the valley states , give rise to a 90@xmath53 phase shift between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to notice that the change in @xmath52 is in mhz range . </S>",
    "<S> so , in ghz scale , like the blue curve ( diamond markers ) in fig .  1 d , this change is not visible </S>",

    "<S> both the sign and magnitude of @xmath63 depends on the interface condition . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath39 decreases when a qd wavefunction is spread over a step edge , the smooth interface case ( green curve ) has the highest amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3f shows that the slope of @xmath63 with @xmath8 changes sign for a 90@xmath53 rotation of @xmath5 and is strongly dependent on the step configuration . the step configuration labeled c3 in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is key to note here that , as @xmath12 also influences @xmath66 and @xmath67 , shown in supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s3 , a different combination of interface steps and @xmath12 can also produce these same soi results of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c and 2a , but might not result in the necessary contribution from micro - magnet to match the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> now the dependence of @xmath4 on the interface condition will cause device - to - device variability , while the dependence on the direction and magnitude of @xmath5 can provide control over the difference in spin splittings . </S>",
    "<S> these results thus give us answers to the questions 1 and 3 asked in paragraph 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",

    "<S> 4c with and without the various step configurations portrayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3d . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that @xmath68 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4c is negligible for a flat interface , but is significant when interface steps are present . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood from figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a and 4b , and/or equation [ equ2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> interface steps generate strong valley - orbit hybridization@xcite causing the valley states to have non - identical wavefunctions , and hence different dipole moments , @xmath70 and/or @xmath71 , as opposed to a flat interface case , which has @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the spatially varying magnetic field has a different effect on the two wavefunctions , thereby contributing to the difference in esr frequencies between the valley states . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b shows @xmath68 as a function of the dot location relative to a step edge , @xmath58 ( as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) and illustrates that @xmath26 has the largest contribution to @xmath4 when the step is in the vicinity of the dot . also , @xmath68 is almost independent of @xmath8 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4d . </S>",
    "<S> the curves labeled c3 in both figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c and 4d correspond to the contribution of @xmath26 in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> now @xmath12 also influences @xmath73 , as shown in supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s4 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a different combination of interface steps and @xmath12 can also produce these same @xmath26 results of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c and 2a , but might not result in the necessary soi contribution to match the experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3f and 4d ( also between equations [ equ1 ] and [ equ2 ] ) reveals that any dependence of @xmath74 on @xmath8 can only come from the soi . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the experimental b - field dependency in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a can not be explained without the soi . </S>",
    "<S> so the effect of the soi can not be ignored even in the presence of a micro - magnet and this answers question 2 raised in the third paragraph . </S>",
    "<S> however , engineering the micro - magnetic field will allow us to engineer the anisotropy of @xmath4 ( question 3 , paragraph 3 ) </S>",
    "<S> . also , the influence of interface steps will cause additional device - to - device variability ( question 1 , paragraph 3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupled spin and valley behavior observed in this work may in principle enable us to simultaneously use the quantum information stored in both spin and valley degrees of freedom of a single electron . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a valley controlled not gate@xcite can be designed in which the spin basis can be the target qubit , while the valley information can work as a control qubit . if we choose such a direction of the external magnetic field , where the valley states have different spin splittings , an applied microwave pulse in resonance with the spin splitting of @xmath75 , will rotate the spin only if the electron is in @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> so we get a not operation of the spin quantum information controlled by the valley quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> spin transitions conditional to valley degrees of freedom are also shown in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> -  @xcite and an inter - valley spin transition , which can entangle spin and valley degrees of freedom , is observed in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> -  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we experimentally observe anisotropic behavior in the electron spin resonance frequencies for different valley states in a si qd with integrated micro - magnets . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze this behavior theoretically and find that intrinsic soi introduces 180@xmath76 periodicity in the difference in the esr frequencies between the valley states , but the inhomogeneous b - field of the micro - magnet also modifies this anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> interfacial non - idealities like steps control both the sign and magnitude of this difference through both soi and inhomogeneous b - field . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the external magnetic field dependence of the resonance frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the measured magnetic field dependence of the difference in resonance frequencies originates only from the soi . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that even though the soi in bulk silicon has been typically ignored as being small , it still plays a major role in determining the valley dependent spin properties in interfacially confined si qds . </S>",
    "<S> these understandings help us answer the questions raised in paragraph 3 , which are crucial for proper operation of various qubit schemes based on silicon quantum dots . </S>"
