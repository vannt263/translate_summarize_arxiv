    "the key points are conduction quantization @xcite due to the discreteness of levels , coulomb blockade due to electron repulsion,@xcite and the interplay between resonant tunneling and charging in double dot structures.@xcite in this work we consider a further issue , the transport by electron - electron scattering .    electron - electron scattering is not included in standard transmission models,@xcite where the coulomb interaction is taken into account by a mean - field approach frequently including exchange - correlation interactions as well . within such models",
    "electron transport strongly depends on the presence of states in the system connecting both leads.@xcite here we show that electron - electron scattering allows for additional transport channels and that it can be consistently implemented using a many - particle basis following the concepts developed in refs .  .",
    "while in double - dot structures , each dot has direct access to a reservoir with a continuous level density , the situation is essentially different in triple - dot structures,@xcite where the states in the central dot only couple to discrete states in the neighboring dots .",
    "thus the properties of these states are far more sensitive to scattering events , which may essentially determine the transport through the structure .",
    "this is precisely the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] : here the upper level 4 of the middle dot can be filled from the left lead by resonant tunneling via level 1 , while its lower level can be emptied into the right lead by resonant tunneling via level 6 .",
    "thus the current is very sensitive to scattering between level 4 and level 3 . in this work",

    "it should be noted that we obtain the pauli master equation , @xcite if we neglect the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix . however , this approximation is only reasonable as long as the spacing between the many - particle energies is large compared to the contact couplings @xmath81.@xcite this is not the case for the systems considered here , so the full set of equations is needed .",

    "if both states 1 and 4 are occupied , the coulomb scattering via @xmath10 is possible . this process transfers one electron from level 1 to level 2 and a second electron from level 4 to level 3 , which can subsequently reach the right lead via level 6 .",
    "thus coulomb scattering establishes a transport path through the nanosystem .",
    "however , when the left fermi level comes into the vicinity of the excited state of the first dot ( @xmath88 mev ) electrons will start to occupy this state .",
    "this causes a decrease in the current ( see fig .",

    "this presence of current enhancement in a finite bias window @xmath94 matching the energy transfer @xmath95 by the scattering process is the characteristic signal of electron transport by coulomb scattering .",
    "this pauli - blocking of the scattering from level 4 to level 3 by occupation of the further level 2 does not appear for other inelastic scattering mechanisms such as phonon scattering .",
    "the description based on scattering given above becomes quantitative if the coulomb scattering is the limiting process for transport through the device , i.e. , if @xmath10 is significantly smaller than @xmath96 and @xmath83 .",
