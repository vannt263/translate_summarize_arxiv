    "the hypercp collaboration recently observed three events for the rare decay mode @xmath7 with dimuon invariant masses narrowly clustered around 214.3mev  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to account for these events within the standard model ( sm ) when long - distance contributions are properly included  @xcite .",
    "however , the probability that the three events have the same dimuon mass , given the sm predictions , is less than one percent .",
    "this result has prompted several studies investigating the consequences of a new state with this mass  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was pointed out that the flavor - changing coupling of the new state to @xmath8 has to be ( dominantly ) of a pseudoscalar or axial - vector nature to explain why it has not been seen in @xmath9 .",
    "this would still allow the new particle to be observed in the other rare modes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "predictions for the new particle s contributing to these modes , consistent with existing constraints , were made in refs .",
    "these predictions indicate that there could be evidence for the particle in the data already taken by the ktev collaboration , specifically in the mode @xmath12 currently being studied  @xcite",
    ".    beyond the above - mentioned theoretical analyses , to explore the possible consequences of the hypercp result in greater detail one has to incorporate some model dependence .",
    "to this end , various ideas have been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we have demonstrated that a  light pseudoscalar higgs boson in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , the  @xmath0 , could be identified as the possible new particle responsible for the hypercp events while satisfying all constraints from kaon and @xmath13-meson decays  @xcite .",
    "now , it is long known that kaon decays involving a light higgs boson , such as in the nmssm , receive two types of contributions that can be of comparable size : two - quark contributions in which the flavor change occurs in one - loop processes involving the light @xmath0 , and four - quark contributions in which the flavor change occurs via a tree - level standard - model @xmath14 exchange with the light @xmath0 radiated off one of the light quarks  @xcite .",
    "not too long ago , we showed that the same situation occurs in the case of light higgs production in hyperon decays  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the modes @xmath15 and @xmath5 in order to present a complete prediction within the model suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , plus the possible modifications recently pointed out in ref .",
    "this differs from the model - independent studies of refs .",
    "@xcite in two important ways . within the nmssm",
    ", we can identify the effective scalar and pseudoscalar couplings of the model - independent studies with specific one - loop processes . here",
    "we consider not only the chargino - mediated diagrams of refs .",
    "@xcite , but also the gluino- and neutralino - mediated diagrams discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we include the four - quark contributions which are missing in refs .",
    "these four - quark contributions were shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be essential to evade the bounds arising from the nonobservation of the @xmath0 in @xmath9 modes  @xcite .",
    "following our earlier work  @xcite , we will here assume that @xmath16 ,    additional processes where such a light @xmath0 would appear have been recently studied in the literature : collider signatures for a light @xmath17",
    "@xcite , @xmath13-meson decays  @xcite , and radiative quarkonium decays  @xcite .",
    "the latter are especially useful because , being flavor conserving , they are independent of the specifics of the one - loop flavor - changing couplings and follow directly from the tree - level couplings of the @xmath0 to down - type quarks .",
    "finally , in this paper we also consider the modes @xmath3 which , like radiative quarkonium decays , are flavor diagonal and only sensitive to the tree - level couplings of the @xmath0 .",
    "the prediction for these modes is , therefore , much less model - dependent .",
    "we find a rate two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding sm rate , that could be probed at da@xmath4ne .",
    "in this section , we briefly review some features of the nmssm that are relevant to our study .",
    "the model is an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and provides a  solution to the so - called @xmath18-problem of the mssm  @xcite . in the nmssm",
    ", there is a gauge - singlet higgs field @xmath19 in addition to the two higgs fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 responsible for the up- and down - type quark masses in the mssm . as a result , the physical spectrum of the extended model has two additional neutral higgs bosons : one a scalar and the other a pseudoscalar .",
    "we follow the specific model described in ref .",
    "@xcite , with suitable modifications .",
    "the superpotential of the model is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 represent the usual quark and lepton fields , @xmath28 are the yukawa couplings , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "the soft - supersymmetry - breaking term in the higgs potential is @xmath31 and the resulting higgs potential has a global @xmath32 symmetry in the limit that the parameters @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the nmssm has two physical @xmath34-odd higgs bosons which are linear combinations of the pseudoscalar components in @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath19 in the model mix , with the @xmath0 being the lighter mass - eigenstate with mass given by @xmath37 in the large-@xmath38 limit , where @xmath39 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath19 and @xmath38 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets .",
    "if the @xmath32 symmetry is broken slightly , the mass of @xmath17 becomes naturally small , with values as low as @xmath40100mev phenomenologically allowed  @xcite .    in the large-@xmath38 limit",
    ", the @xmath0 is mostly the singlet pseudoscalar and couples to sm fields through mixing .",
    "also in the large-@xmath38 limit , its couplings to fermions are suppressed by a factor of @xmath38 with respect to those of the @xmath41 in the mssm  @xcite . in particular , this makes the tree - level couplings to up - type quarks negligible .",
    "the tree - level couplings to down - type quarks and charged leptons can be described in terms of one parameter , @xmath42 where the parameter @xmath43 involves both the different higgs vevs and soft - supersymmetry - breaking parameters , @xmath44 with @xmath45gev being the electroweak scale and @xmath46 . requiring the mass of the heavier pseudoscalar not to exceed 500gev , ref .",
    "@xcite finds a lower bound @xmath47 for @xmath48 . at the same time , the contribution of @xmath0 to the muon anomalous magnetic moment results in an upper bound @xmath49  @xcite .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this scenario leads to four - quark contributions that easily reproduce the hypercp result .",
    "unfortunately , they are also in conflict with the nonobservation of the @xmath0 in @xmath9  @xcite . to satisfy these bounds ,",
    "it is necessary to include contributions from one - loop flavor - changing diagrams in the nmssm , which depend in a complicated way on the many parameters of the model .",
    "we can describe them in terms of an effective lagrangian for the @xmath50 couplings as @xmath51 where the parameters @xmath52 are generally independent .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we followed ref .",
    "@xcite to consider only chargino - mediated one - loop diagrams in the large-@xmath38 limit .",
    "furthermore , we selected the supersymmetric parameters so as to suppress the @xmath53 transition and in this way satisfy the nonobservation of @xmath0 in @xmath13 decay  @xcite .",
    "this scenario led to @xmath54 with @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "more recently , ref .",
    "@xcite has pointed out a  different scenario in which @xmath56 also receive contributions from gluino- and neutralino- mediated one - loop diagrams .",
    "although the gluino - mediated contributions are suppressed by a factor of @xmath38 compared to the chargino contributions , the former are proportional to the strong coupling @xmath57 , compensating for the suppression factor , and hence can be as important as the latter",
    ". moreover , in some regions of the parameter space the neutralino - mediated contributions could be comparable to the gluino - mediated ones  @xcite .",
    "if all the different contributions are similar in size , then @xmath56 can become effectively independent .",
    "this opens up the possibility of satisfying the kaon bounds without the four - quark contributions by having @xmath58 , which results in an effective @xmath50 coupling that is mostly pseudoscalar .",
    "the hypercp observation can then be explained as in the model - independent analysis of refs .",
    "however , to have @xmath58 requires some sort of fine tuning .",
    "furthermore , the four - quark contributions may not necessarily be negligible . in our analysis",
    ", we will thus keep @xmath59 and @xmath60 independent and constrain them with data .",
    "also , we will assume that @xmath34 is conserved and hence @xmath56 are real .",
