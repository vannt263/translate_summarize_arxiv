    "nonequilibrium growth models leading naturally to self - organized fractal structures , such as diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite , are of continuing interest due to their relevance for many important physical processes including dielectric breakdown  @xcite , electrochemical deposition @xcite , and laplacian flow  @xcite .",
    "a powerful method , namely iterated stochastic conformal mapping @xcite , has been already successfully applied to generate and analyze dla @xcite and laplacian @xcite growth patterns in two dimensions .",
    "this has provided an alternative way to address many of the important open questions related to pattern formation in dla in two dimensions , one of these being the existence of minimal fields for growth at the boundary of the growing cluster . in previous work",
    "@xcite we studied the properties induced by a _ fixed _ , material dependent critical field @xmath10 for growth , and showed that in the presence of such a threshold all clusters ultimately become pinned and , in addition , this simple constraint has remarkable consequences for the resulting patterns  the rich , branched structure of dla is replaced by a much lower dimensional shape consisting of a few surviving branches .    in this paper",
    "we address a similar , but significantly more important question because of its relationship to the multifractal spectrum of dla , that of what happens when there exists a critical field for growth on the boundary of the cluster , field decaying like @xmath0 as the cluster increases in size .",
    "we shall call this model the `` @xmath11-model '' . as we will show below , as @xmath11 decreases from @xmath3 toward a critical value @xmath12 ( which corresponds to the most singular possible behavior for the laplacian field , that occuring at the tip of a line )",
    ", there is a continuous transition from dla toward lower dimensional shapes for which the multifractal spectrum is necessarily different from that of dla .",
    "we study this transition in terms of the fractal dimension @xmath5 of the emerging patterns , and we derive analytic expressions for the behavior of @xmath5 in the range @xmath8 where the dla universality class breaks down and @xmath9 close to the pinning transition .",
    "witten and sander @xcite have shown that the growth probability at any point @xmath13 on the boundary of a dla cluster of length @xmath14 is given by the harmonic measure @xmath15 , where @xmath16 obeys laplace s equation @xmath17 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath18 on the ( evolving ) boundary of the cluster and @xmath19 as @xmath20 ( corresponding to a uniform flux of particles far away from the cluster ) .",
    "the model we study is a variant of the two - dimensional dla growth model described above in which growth is disallowed at points on the cluster boundary where the probability for growth is smaller than a critical value @xmath0 , where @xmath1 ( the exact meaning will be defined later ) is the radius of the @xmath21 particle cluster , i.e. , @xmath22|\\nabla v ( s')|ds ' } } , & |\\nabla v| > r_n^{-\\gamma } , \\cr 0 , & |\\nabla v| < r_n^{-\\gamma},\\cr \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the multifractal exponent at point @xmath24 on the cluster boundary , @xmath14 is the length of the boundary , and the step function @xmath25 ensures that only those regions of the cluster boundary obeying @xmath26 contribute to the normalization integral .",
    "estimates of this integral will be very important in our analysis of the fractal dimension of the growing `` @xmath11-cluster '' .",
    "since we need to calculate the harmonic measure on a freely evolving interface , this is handled by using conformal mapping techniques @xcite .",
    "the method was presented in great detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , and thus here we will just briefly review the main results .    the basic idea is to follow the evolution of the conformal mapping @xmath27 of the exterior of the unit circle in a mathematical @xmath28plane onto the complement of the cluster of @xmath29 particles in the physical @xmath30plane rather than directly the evolution of the cluster s boundary .",
    "the initial condition is chosen to be @xmath31 .",
    "the process of adding a new `` particle '' of constant shape and linear scale @xmath32 to the cluster of @xmath33 `` particles '' at a position @xmath13 which is chosen randomly according to the harmonic measure is described via a function @xmath34 , where @xmath35 -1 \\right \\ } ^a \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\phi_{\\lambda,\\theta } ( \\omega ) = e^{i \\theta } \\phi_{\\lambda,0}(e^{-i \\theta } \\omega ) \\",

    "the shape of the bump depends on the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "following the analysis in @xcite , we have used @xmath39 througout this paper , as we believe the large scale asymptotic properties will not be affected by the microscopic shape of the added bump .    the conformal map for an @xmath29-particle cluster @xmath40 can be built by adding one `` particle '' to an @xmath33-particle cluster @xmath41 , resulting in the recursive dynamics @xmath42 which can be solved in terms of iterations of the elementary bump map @xmath43 , @xmath44 in eqs .",
    "[ recursive ] and  [ comp ] the angle @xmath45 $ ] at step @xmath29 is randomly chosen since the harmonic measure on the real cluster translates to a uniform measure on the unit circle in the mathematical plane , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is chosen in order to ensure that the size of the bump in the physical @xmath30 plane is @xmath32 . since @xmath32 is a natural length scale in the problem ,",
    "in can be scaled out by measuring all the lengths in terms of it .",
    "we re - emphasize here that although the composition eq .  [ comp ] appears at first sight to be a standard iteration of stochastic maps , this is not so because the order of iterations is inverted  the last point of the trajectory is the inner argument in this iteration . as a result",

    "it can be easily seen that the rich , branched structure of the cluster at @xmath63 changes , as @xmath11 decreases toward @xmath68 , into a much lower - dimensional shape with only a few branches surviving .",

    "these results theoretically let us begin with a very simple argument based on the assumption that the clusters have a multifractal spectrum in the sense described above , in that the interface consists of sets of @xmath86 sites with growth probabilities @xmath87 . since the constraint will cut - off growth at regions in the cluster with exponents in the range @xmath88 of the multifractal spectrum , we can write down the following equation for the rate of growth of the cluster in the presence of the barrier in terms of the rate of growth of a dla ( no barrier for growth ) cluster @xmath89 where @xmath90 . the enhancement of growth comes from eq .",
    "[ growth ] together with the estimate @xmath91 now , we know that the harmonic measure is concentrated at @xmath92 , and thus for @xmath3 the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand at @xmath92 , while for @xmath8 it is dominated by the value at @xmath11 , and thus @xmath93 where @xmath94 is some constant independent of @xmath21 .",
