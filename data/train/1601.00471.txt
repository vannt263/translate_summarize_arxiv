    "the present stage of accelerate expansion of the universe seems to be well established from the analysis of observational data . besides the supernova ia data @xcite , the data from the observation of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite , the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite",
    ", large scale structures @xcite , weak lensing @xcite , the differential age of old galaxies ( @xmath3 ) @xcite , give strong evidences for the present accelerated expansion phase .",
    "since gravity is attractive , the cosmic accelerate expansion requires some new form of exotic matter that leads to violation of the strong energy condition ( sec ) @xcite , as far as the general relativity ( gr ) theory is considered .",
    "this exotic component is dubbed dark energy .",
    "the most popular , and most simple , candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant .",
    "interpreted as a manifestation of the quantum vacuum energy , the cosmological constant faces however a huge discrepancy between the observed value and the predicted one .",
    "the exact value of this discrepancy depends on many details , but in general it mounts to many dozen orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the incertitude about the dynamical origin of the observed accelerated expansion led to many speculations about possible extensions of the general relativity ( gr ) theory in such way that the accelerated expansion could be obtained without the introduction of dark energy . in this sense ,",
    "one of these possible extensions is to generalise the einstein - hilbert action including non - linear geometric terms .",
    "one of this proposal is the @xmath0 theories @xcite , where the non - linear terms are combinations of the ricci scalar @xmath4 .",
    "such theories may give very good results at cosmological scales but must be complemented with a screening mechanism in order not to spoil the achievements of the gr theory at scales of the solar system @xcite .",
    "there are a long list of other possible , and generally more complex , modifications of the gr theory @xcite    another problem concerning the applications of the gr theory to concrete problems is the presence of singularities , as that predicted in the primordial universe and in the end of the life of some massive stars .",
    "the presence of such singularities seems to point to the limit of application of the gr theory , requiring perhaps to consider quantum effects in the strong gravitational regime . some other possibility to cure this singularity problem , yet in the context of a classical theory , is to consider as source of the gravitational equations matter fields that may lead to violation of at least some of the energy conditions .",
    "examples are given by non - linear gauge fields , like the electromagnetic field .",
    "non linear electromagnetism @xcite has been conceived originally to cure singularity problems in the maxwell theory . in gravity theories",
    ", the electromagnetic field appears as one of the sources of of the structure of the space - time . in such a context",
    ", some success to avoid singularities has been obtained in implementing such extension of the classical maxwell field @xcite .    in the ref .",
    "@xcite both proposals of extension of the usual gravitational and gauge field theories were considered . in that paper , the emphasis was in the study of black hole configurations . a very general form of the this theory mixing the @xmath0 theory and the non - linear electromagnetic lagrangian @xmath1 has been considered .",
    "a static , spherically symmetric space - time has been used .",
    "particular , solutions with horizon ( thus , candidates to represent a black hole ) were found , but without the singularity existing in the usual black hole solutions of the gr theory .",
    "this singularity - free black hole solutions imply the violation of the sec only in certain regions of the space - time . however , the other energy conditions are generally satisfied .",
    "we remember that the energy conditions are directly connected with the existence of singularities in gr theory @xcite .    in the present paper , we revisit the problem treated in the ref .",
    "@xcite , and we show that new non - singular solutions are possible .",
    "this new solutions emerge from a specific , but very appealing , choice of the mass function @xmath2 , which will be properly defined later .",
    "the mass function we will use was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with gr theory coupled to non - linear electromagnetic field , in other to satisfy some requirements , like to avoid violation of the weak energy condition ( wec ) and to have the reissner - nordstrm asymptotic limit : the mass function @xmath2 given in ref .",
    "@xcite is the most general functional form satisfying the wec in gr . as it was found for other mass functions in ref .",
    "@xcite , the employment of the mass function of ref .",
    "@xcite in our general context implies that the violation of sec occurs only in a limited region of the space - time , the other energy conditions being satisfied in the entire space - time .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    ", the equations of motion are written down . in section iii , we determine the new non - singular solutions and analyse the fate of the energy conditions for these solutions .",
    "the final conclusions are presented in section iv . in the appendix , it is shown explicitly that the solutions found here are asymptotically regular .",
    "the @xmath0 gravity is defined by the action , @xmath5 \\label{action}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 stands for the determinant of the metric @xmath7 , @xmath0 is a given function of the ricci scalar @xmath4 , @xmath8 represents the lagrangian density of the matter and other fields , and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the newton s gravitational constant and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "there are two main approaches for this theory , the first one supposing the the dynamical fields are the metric and the matter field , known as metric formalism , and the second one , called palatini formalism , for which the dynamical fields are the metric , the matter field , but with the levi - civita connection independent of the metric .",
    "in what follows we will use the first approach .    applying the variational principle in terms of the metric to the action ( [ action ] ) , we find the following field equations : @xmath12 where @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 is the ricci tensor , @xmath15 stands for the covariant derivative , @xmath16 is the dalembertian , and @xmath17 is the matter energy - momentum tensor .    in the present work , we will analyse the coupling of the @xmath0 gravity with a non - linear electrodynamic theory ( ned ) , given by , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , and with @xmath20 being the maxwell tensor , and @xmath21 is an arbitrary function of @xmath22 .",
    "a similar structure was exploited in ref .",
    "we will first review the methodology employed in that reference , which will be applied in the present paper in order to find new regular black hole solutions .    considering the ned coupling ,",

    "fixed the spherical coordinates , it is possible to impose the quasi - global condition by choosing a radial coordinate : @xmath39 this is an additional requirement to the metric functions since the coordinate system has already been fixed .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the existence of regular black hole structures for a general @xmath0 theory , sourced by non - linear electromagnetic terms expressed by the lagrangian @xmath1 .",
    "our approach follows very closely that one employed in ref .",
    "@xcite : instead of choosing specific forms for the the @xmath0 and @xmath1 functions , the approach consists in expressing the metric in terms of a mass function @xmath2 and to choose a mass function that satisfies some requirements .",
    "specifically , we have used the mass function determined in ref . @xcite .",
    "such mass function was constructed , in the context of gr theory coupled to non - linear electromagnetic field , in order to satisfy the wec and to have an asymptotic reissner - nordstrm limit .",
    "in fact , the chosen mass function @xmath2 is the most general functional form satisfying the wec in gr .",
    "applied to the case of a general @xmath0 and @xmath1 functions , that mass function of ref .",
    "@xcite leads to regular black hole solutions which contain two horizons , the event horizon and the cauchy horizon .",
    "we worked out completely two specific cases of that mass function , by choosing specific values for the free parameters in the model developed in ref .",
    "the regular character of the solutions is attested by the regular behaviour of the geometric invariants , like the ricci scalar and the kretschmann scalar .",
    "asymptotically , as expected , the metric functions reproduces the reissner - nordstrm solution of the gr theory .",
    "the energy conditions are satisfied for the two specific cases studied here , except for the case of the strong energy condition ( sec ) which is violated in the vicinity of the cauchy horizon .",
    "of course , a violation of at least some of the energy conditions must occur if regular solution must be extracted from the original theory .",
    "in this case , the violation is quite mild since it is only the energy condition connected with the convergence of the geodesics that is violated ( sec ) , and even though in a quite restricted region of the whole space - time .    evidently , there are many open issues related to the problem treated here , like the complete determination of the @xmath1 function corresponding to the configurations found , and the stability problem .",

    "the metric function @xmath92 , for the solution , behaves in this limit as , @xmath93 from this behaviour , it is possible to verify that the metric behaves , up to second order , as in the reissner - nordstrm solution . in this limit",

    "but this divergence does not affect the physical quantities neither the equations of motion for this solution . in order to verify this",
    ", we will evaluate the electric energy density .",
    "hence , let us turn the attention to other physical quantities like the electrical energy density ( right side to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) , which becomes , @xmath100 the electrical energy density goes to a constant in the limit @xmath101 . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective electric energy density is given , in this limit , by @xmath102 which goes asymptotically to zero .",
    "for the solution the left side for first equation of motion , in the limit @xmath103 , leads to , @xmath104 this result shows that the infinite quantity coming from @xmath105 does not affect the equations of motion .",
    "the same happens for the second equation of motion . for the third equation of motion , we find @xmath106 hence , the equations of motion are regular in the limit @xmath101 : the equations are consistent since the infinity coming from @xmath105 is compensated by other terms .",
    "+ now , we perform a similar asymptotical analysis ( @xmath101 , with @xmath89 ) for the second solution given by ( [ a3 ] ) . in this case , @xmath107 showing the asymptotically the metric coincides with the reissner - nordstrm .",
    "the function @xmath0 for this solution reads , @xmath108 again , the function @xmath0 becomes asymptotically a constant which depends on @xmath82 , which can not be made zero .",
    "inspecting the action , we have that @xmath109 or @xmath110 . on the other hand ,",
    "the component @xmath98 becomes , @xmath111 hence , the component @xmath98 diverges in the limit @xmath101 . but",
    "this does not imply the presence of divergences in quantities like the energy density , among others , neither in the equations of motion .",
    "in fact , the lagrangian @xmath1 becomes @xmath112 leading to , @xmath113 for the electrical energy density we find @xmath114 which is a constant in the limit @xmath101 . for the effective energy density , we find , @xmath115 which goes to zero in the limit @xmath101 .",
    "let us now verify how the equations of motion behave .",
    "the left hand side of the first one reads in that limit , @xmath116 this shows that the infinity introduced by @xmath117 is cancelled , and does not contribute to the equations of motion .",
    "the same happens for the second equation ( by symmetry ) . for the third equation ,",
    "we find , @xmath118 hence , we confirm that a regular behaviour is also verified for the second solution , since there is no divergence in the physical relevant quantities neither in the equations of motion .",
