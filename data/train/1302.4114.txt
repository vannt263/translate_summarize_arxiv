    "streamers are rapidly growing filaments of weakly ionized plasma , whose dynamics are controlled by highly localized space charge regions and steep plasma density gradients .",
    "the dynamics of the streamer ionization front are governed by electron dynamics in electric fields above the break - down value ; therefore the plasma is very far from equilibrium , and the neutral gas stays cold while the ionization front passes .",
    "streamers occur widely in pulsed discharges , both in nature and in technology . as their size scales with inverse gas density",
    ", streamers occur in the limited volumes of plasma technological devices mostly at high gas densities , while planetary atmospheres also can host huge discharges at very low gas densities ; so - called sprite discharges  @xcite are streamers , they exist at altitudes of up to 90 km in our atmosphere , i.e. , at pressures down to well below 10  @xmath0bar .",
    "for a cluster issue on streamers , sprites and lightning , we refer to  @xcite and the 19 original articles therein , discussing common issues of streamer dynamics in atmospheric discharges and plasma technology , including discharge evolution and subsequent chemical reactions .",
    "streamers are a key element in gas processing in so - called corona reactors  @xcite as well as in high voltage technology  @xcite ; they are used for the treatment of polluted gases  @xcite and water  @xcite or for plasma enhanced vapor deposition @xcite .",
    "the plasma bullets observed in plasma jets in noble gases have now been identified with streamers  @xcite .",
    "studies of breakdown phenomena at atmospheric pressure in short non - uniform air gaps @xcite or in microwave fields @xcite benefit from related streamer studies .",
    "streamers appear as well in resistive plate chambers used in high - energy physics , where the streamer mode of operation must be carefully controlled and optimized @xcite .",
    "the progress of streamer simulations with fluid models has recently been reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "the main point for the present paper is that essentially all these numerical studies are based on the classical fluid model , as we have called it in  @xcite .",
    "the classical fluid model for the electron density contains a reaction term for impact ionization and attachment , a drift term accounting for electron displacement in the local field , and electron diffusion ; the reaction term is typically taken as a function of the local electric field .",
    "the structure of this classical model with reaction , drift and diffusion is based on basic symmetry considerations and conservation laws ; it has emerged as a purely phenomenological model in the course of the past century .    on the other hand ,",
    "cross - sections for the collisions of electrons with molecules have become available with growing accuracy @xcite .",
    "they are the input either for the boltzmann equation or for monte carlo models .",
    "these microscopic particle models have not yet been appropriately linked with the much older phenomenological fluid models .",
    "this becomes evident when comparing their solutions .",
    "a negative streamer ionization front in nitrogen represented by a monte carlo model can not appropriately be described by a classical fluid model even if the transport and reaction coefficients for the fluid model are derived from the monte carlo model @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the coefficients for the fluid model were derived as so - called bulk coefficients ; therefore in this model the electron swarms evolve correctly , and ionization fronts in a given electric field propagate with the correct velocity , as they are so - called puled fronts  @xcite .",
    "however , the electron density behind the ionization front is too low .",
    "as we will see in section  [ sec3 ] of the present paper , a classical fluid model evaluated with flux coefficients gives better ionization densities behind the front , but too low front velocities .",
    "a phenomenological extension of the classical fluid model with a gradient expansion considerably improves the approximation of the microscopic electron dynamics  @xcite , and it cures the deficiency of the local field approximation by including a dependence of the impact ionization rate on the local electron density gradient  @xcite . that the extended fluid model matches the monte carlo model well up to the moment of streamer branching ,",
    "can also be seen in a recent comparison of three - dimensional model simulations in  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the model is still based on a local field approximation , therefore electron energies in the streamer interior erroneously are modeled as relaxing instantaneously to the low field in the streamer interior .    a full simulation by monte carlo models would deliver the physically most reliable results , but this is computationally extremely costly . as a compromise between accuracy and efficiency , hybrid methods",
    "@xcite have been developed in the past years to track the fast and energetic processes in the ionization front with a particle model , and to model the many electrons at lower fields in the streamer interior with a fluid model .",
    "fluid models are also the most efficient for the long time evolution in the streamer interior where slow chemical reactions and a slow thermalization of the deposited energy sets in .",
    "these demands on fast and quantitative streamer simulations ask for the development of a fluid model that accurately incorporates the microscopic electron dynamics contained in boltzmann or monte carlo models",
    ". we will here follow the strategy to derive such a model not from phenomenological considerations , but through a systematic derivation from the boltzmann equation .",
    "this paper is the first in an ongoing investigation of high order fluid models for streamer discharges ; it is focused on the derivation of first and higher order fluid models and on the derivation and correct implementation of transport data in these models .",
    "section [ sec2 ] describes the derivation of models of different order .",
    "the starting point is the set of balance equations obtained as velocity moments of the boltzmann equation .",
    "then the derivation of the classical first order model is briefly described , and previous approaches to higher order models are summarized . in section [ sec2d ] our new high order fluid model",
    "is derived in a systematic manner .",
    "the balance / moment equations are closed after the balance equation for the energy flux .",
    "this is done by approximating the high order tensors in the energy flux balance equation by a product of two lower moments while the collision transfer terms are evaluated using momentum transfer theory . in section 3 ,",
    "electron transport properties as an input in fluid models are calculated using a multi term theory for solving the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "we pay particular attention to the accuracy of the calculation and the proper use in both the first and high order fluid models .",
    "the results of our multi term solution of boltzmann s equation are compared with those obtained by the publicly available boltzmann solver bolsig+ developed by hagelaar and pitchford   for electrons in molecular nitrogen .",
    "bolsig+ is a popular boltzmann solver based on a classical two term theory so we have been motivated to check its accuracy and integrity against the advanced and highly sophisticated multi term boltzmann solver developed by the group from the james cook university and their associates @xcite . in section 4",
    "we give the results for negative planar fronts obtained with the first order model with particular emphasis upon the consistent implementation of transport data .",
    "the results for various streamer properties obtained with different type of input data are compared . a thorough analysis of numerical streamer front solutions with our high order model , and a comparison with monte carlo results",
    "is contained in an accompanying second paper  @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the boltzmann equation for charged particles in an electric field @xmath1 @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the distribution function in phase space at the position @xmath4 and velocity @xmath5 for each charged component @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the differential operator with respect to space @xmath4 and @xmath8 with respect to velocity @xmath5 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are charge and mass of species @xmath6 , and @xmath11 is time .",
    "the right - hand side of equation ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) , @xmath12 , describes the collisions of charged particles with neutral molecules , accounting for elastic , inelastic , and non - conservative ( e.g. ionizing or attaching ) collisions , and @xmath13 is the velocity distribution function of the neutral gas ( usually taken to be maxwellian at temperature @xmath14 ) .",
    "streamer discharges have a characteristic nonlinear coupling between densities of charged particles and electric field .",
    "the space charge modifies the field , and the field determines the drift , diffusion and rate coefficients .",
    "the electric field has to be calculated self - consistently with poisson s equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath9 and @xmath17 are the charges and densities of species @xmath6 that can be electrons and ions . as ions are much heavier than electrons , their motion is typically neglected within the ionization front , and",
    "the analysis focuses on the electron evolution .",
    "thus , in what follows we suppress the charged particle index @xmath6 in equation ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) and focus in the electron dynamics .    after solving equations ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.1.2 ] ) , quantities of physical interest could be obtained as velocity ` moments ' of the distribution functions , starting with the number density @xmath18 followed by higher order quantities @xmath19 with @xmath20 furnishing the average velocity @xmath21 , average energy @xmath22 , and so on .    equations ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.1.2 ] ) represent a non - linear coupled system of partial differential equations in 6-dimensional phase space and in time , with a complicated collision operator @xmath23 .",
    "for a complete problem description , appropriate initial and boundary conditions on @xmath24 in phase space must be implemented .    for streamers , it is very difficult to solve equations ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.1.2 ] ) due to the large gradients of electric fields and of charged particle densities at their fronts .",
    "moreover , the streamers create a self - consistent field enhancement at their tips which allow them to penetrate into regions where the background field is too low for efficient ionization processes to take place . from a kinetic theory point of view , this is a non - stationary , non - hydrodynamic and non - linear problem where space and time should be treated on an equal footing with velocity in equation ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) . clearly , the numerical solution of equations ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.1.2 ] ) for the full streamer problem is a formidable task and a fluid equation treatment is more tractable . in a fluid approach ,",
    "the problem of solving the boltzmann equation for @xmath25 in phase - space is replaced by a set of low order approximate ( velocity ) moment equations of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "fluid equations may be derived either directly as moments of ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) or from first principles using physical arguments .",
    "following the first approach , the set of moment / balance equations can be found by multiplying ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) by @xmath26 and integrating over all velocities @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the average over the velocity @xmath5 of the charged particles , and @xmath29 is the collision term in the balance equation : @xmath30 to derive the term @xmath31 with its negative sign , a partial integration over @xmath5 has been performed .",
    "if one now takes @xmath26 consecutively equal to @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , etc . ,",
    "equation ( [ 2.1.5 ] ) generates an infinite series of equations , a full solution of which would be equivalent to calculating @xmath25 itself . in practice , one truncates after a certain moment equation ; in this process obviously some information of the boltzmann equation is lost .",
    "therefore we now discuss the derivation of first and second order fluid models with their truncations of the moment equations , and then we derive systematically our new high order fluid model .",
    "first we derive the classical fluid model as an approximation from the boltzmann equation .",
    "we use continuity and momentum balance equation , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath33 , and truncate the set ( [ 2.1.5 ] ) at the momentum balance equation , @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the average local electron velocity .",
    "now the velocities are decomposed into an average velocity @xmath40 plus random velocities @xmath41 with zero mean ( @xmath42 )",
    ". on introducing the pressure tensor @xmath43 equation ( [ 2.2.2 ] ) becomes @xmath44 where the following identity was used @xmath45 \\nonumber \\\\   & = \\nabla \\cdot \\big ( nm \\;{\\mbox{\\boldmath\\/${v}$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath\\/${v}$}}\\big ) + \\nabla \\cdot \\big(nm\\;\\langle \\left ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath\\/${c}$}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath\\/${v}$ } } \\right ) \\left ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath\\/${c}$}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath\\/${v}$}}\\right ) \\rangle \\big)\\big ] \\label{2.2.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term in the left - hand side of ( [ 2.2.4 ] ) can be expanded as @xmath46 .",
    "\\label{2.2.6}\\ ] ] now we substitute ( [ 2.2.6 ] ) into ( [ 2.2.4 ] ) , use the continuity equation ( [ 2.2.1 ] ) and introduce the convective time derivative @xmath47 which measures the rate of change in a reference frame moving with the mean drift velocity @xmath40 of the electrons . the momentum balance equation then obtains the form @xmath48 the physical interpretation of this equation is straightforward : the rate of change of the mean electron velocity is due to the force of the electric field plus forces due to the pressure of the electron fluid itself and due to internal forces associated with the collisional interactions with a large number of neutral gas molecules at rest",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that the form with the convective derivative @xmath49 is not useful for the analysis of a full streamer problem where local fields and therefore local mean electron velocities @xmath40 vary largely in space and time .    because the system has been truncated",
    ", the yet unspecified tensor @xmath50 ( [ 2.2.3 ] ) of electron pressure appears on the right - hand side of ( [ 2.2.9 ] ) , and a closure assumption needs to be found .",
    "if the distribution of random velocities is close to isotropic , the diagonal terms of @xmath50 are equal and given by the scalar kinetic pressure @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unity tensor , @xmath54 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath55 is the temperature .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the isotropy of the velocity fluctuations and of the pressure is a strong assumption at the streamer tip where the electric fields are high and strong pressure gradients exist . in this streamer region",
    "the random spread of electrons along the field direction can differ significantly from the perpendicular direction .",
    "the next simplifying assumption concerns the collision terms .",
    "an expression often used for momentum transfer by collision is @xmath56 which assumes that the force per unit volume exerted on the electrons due to collisions with neutral molecules is proportional to the average electron velocity .",
    "the proportionality constant is called the effective momentum transfer collision frequency ; it accounts for momentum exchange in elastic and inelastic collisions . with this simplifying assumption and neglecting",
    "the transfer of momentum in non - conservative collisions relative to other momentum transfer collisions ( which is usually a good approximation ) , the momentum balance equation ( [ 2.2.9 ] ) becomes @xmath57 if the rate of momentum change @xmath58 is smaller than the rate of momentum transfer @xmath59 , and if the gradients in electron energy can be neglected , one gets the following expression for the average flux of the electrons @xmath60 where mobility and diffusion constant are given by @xmath61 if the system is close to equilibrium . in this case",
    "the nernst - townsend - einstein relation @xmath62 is valid .",
    "the steady - state form of equation ( [ 2.2.12 ] ) is an acceptable approximation because the effective time constant for momentum transfer @xmath63 at atmospheric pressure is generally much less than the time scale on which the local electric field varies within a streamer @xcite .",
    "further from equilibrium as in the head of the streamer where the electric fields are high , the approximation ( [ 2.2.10 ] ) is not valid as the velocity fluctuations of the electrons are clearly anisotropic .",
    "let us consider once more the special case where the average velocity of electrons is stationary . from equation ( [ 2.2.9 ] ) and neglecting momentum transfer in non - conservative collisions , we obtain @xmath64 and as a result for the flux we have @xmath65 . \\label{2.2.17}\\ ] ] comparing the last equation and equation ( [ 2.2.13 ] ) , it is obvious that quantity @xmath66 is the reminisce of the diffusion tensor often used in the drift - diffusion approximation instead of the diffusion constant . however , the physical interpretation of this quantity is not _ a priori _ clear .",
    "though this quantity assumes the anisotropic nature of the temperature tensor , it reduces to the diffusion constant @xmath67 when the effective momentum transfer collision frequency @xmath59 is independent of the electron energy . for an energy - dependent effective momentum transfer collision frequency ,",
    "the straightforward generalization of the einstein relation for the diffusion constant ( [ 2.2.14 ] ) to the diffusion tensor @xmath68 or application of @xmath69 in the equation for the average flux ( [ 2.2.13 ] ) is misleading and reader is referred to @xcite where the so - called generalized einstein relation were introduced using the momentum and energy balance equations .",
    "however , the generalization of the diffusion constant @xmath67 appearing in ( [ 2.2.13 ] ) to diffusion tensor @xmath68 is a very welcome step in fluid modeling of streamer discharges due to the often strong anisotropic nature of the diffusion tensor for certain gases and due to deviations of the electron velocity distribution function from a maxwellian distribution of velocities in different spatial regions of the streamers .    when the above approximation for the particle flux is inserted into equation ( [ 2.2.1 ] ) , we get the well known reaction drift diffusion expression for the charged particle motion in the discharge @xmath70    originally this approximation",
    "was not derived from the boltzmann equation , but derived on purely phenomenological grounds .",
    "it is clear that the equation must have the structure of a continuity equation with a source term for electron generation and loss .",
    "the parametric dependence of the source term is open at this point ; within the classical model the source term is assumed to depend on local particle densities and on the local electric field .",
    "the second approximation concerns the electron velocity @xmath40 . on a time scale",
    "much larger than the collision frequency , the electron motion is overdamped , so the electrons must drift against the direction of the electric field according to the second term in ( [ 2.2.19 ] ) .",
    "the stochastic and undirected motion is modeled in an _ ad hoc _ manner through the diffusion term ; the fact that the diffusion correction is added to the drift term and not included in any other functional manner is not _ a priori _ clear and can actually be deduced from the above analysis .    in conclusion ,",
    "the lowest level of fluid approximation , also called classical model or first order model , is given by the equations @xmath71 coupled to the poisson equation for the electric field , @xmath72 here @xmath73 and @xmath74 are positive and negative ion densities , while @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the ionization and attachment collision frequencies due to electron - molecule collisions , and @xmath77 is the electric potential .",
    "the numerical solution of the system ( [ 2.2.20])-([2.2.23 ] ) requires the transport properties @xmath0 , @xmath68 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 as a function of the local electric field for the gas in question .",
    "the derivation and implementation of transport data is discussed in section  3 .",
    "the numerical solutions of planar streamer fronts with these transport data are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we now turn to models that include the second velocity moment of the boltzmann equation , i.e. , the energy balance equation .",
    "we will see that the closure of this equation is not a straight forward process , and we will discuss some approximations made in the literature .",
    "the results of a second order model and of our high order model for planar streamer fronts will be compared in our second paper  @xcite .",
    "the first important steps beyond first order fluid models of streamer discharges , to our knowledge , were carried out by abbas and bayle @xcite , and by bayle and carenbois @xcite .",
    "they employed a second order model which involves the energy balance equation to explore the zone at the streamer tip where the electron energy is not determined anymore by the local electric field only .",
    "however , as pointed out by kanzari _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the accuracy of their model was restricted by the drastic assumptions taken in their energy balance equation .",
    "they evaluated the source term in the energy balance equation and corresponding averages by assuming a maxwellian distribution for the electrons .",
    "guo and wu @xcite have developed a more sophisticated second order model in which the langevin theory was used to simplify the collision source terms with _ a priori _ knowledge of the relaxation times of electron energy and momentum .",
    "_ @xcite have made an important step further by calculating the source term in the energy equation in a more consistent way where the _ ad hoc _",
    "assumptions for the distribution function were avoided .",
    "a similar approach was later used by eichwald _",
    "@xcite in their simulations of the streamer dynamics and of the radical formation in a pulsed corona discharge used for flue gas control .",
    "their results showed that the average electron velocity in the streamer head is largely overestimated by the classical first order model .",
    "as a consequence , electron density and radical density in the ionized channel were up to 50% higher than with the second order model .",
    "the salient feature of their theory is the fact that the heat flux term in the energy balance equation was explicitly neglected , but this , unfortunately , is of questionable accuracy .",
    "we will illustrate in streamer simulations in our second paper  @xcite that the energy flux plays an important role in determining the streamer behavior .",
    "thus , particular care should be taken with the closure through specification of the energy flux .",
    "even for charged particle swarms under non - hydrodynamic conditions one must be careful how to specify the heat flux vector @xcite .",
    "we now discuss how the fluid equations should be closed for streamers , while we stress that the method itself is applicable to a much wider range of phenomena .",
    "we now derive a fluid model including the energy flux equation , i.e. , we truncate at the moment equation with the third power of velocity .",
    "we will argue that the energy flux equation is crucial for the success of the fluid model for streamers . inserting different moments of @xmath5 into equation ( [ 2.1.5 ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 different forms of these equations that some readers might be familiar with , are given in the appendix .",
    "it will be shown in section [ sec2 g ] that the explicit form of the high order tensors appearing in the divergence term of the energy flux equation ( [ 2.3.4 ] ) is not required .",
    "this system of equations is exact at this stage , but not very useful and the reason is twofold .",
    "first , there are more unknowns than equations , the familiar problem of closure .",
    "the set of fluid equations can be increased to an arbitrary size merely by taking higher velocity moments of the boltzmann equation .",
    "second , the definition of the system requires the respective collision terms @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast to monte carlo simulations or kinetic equations in which cross sections for charged particle scattering enter into the calculations in a fairly clear way , in fluid equations the collisions are treated in a variety of ways which are not necessarily consistent with the data itself and/or with the system under consideration .",
    "there are many examples which illustrate this issue and the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed discussion . in the context of streamer and breakdown studies beyond first order fluid models ,",
    "it has become common practice to evaluate the collision terms and averages by assuming some particular form of the velocity distribution function , usually maxwellian @xcite .",
    "let us consider the form of the collision terms in the balance equations ( [ 2.3.1])-([2.3.4 ] ) . in this work",
    "we characterize the elastic , inelastic and non - conservative collisions by corresponding average collision frequencies .",
    "a collision frequency @xmath82 for collisions between charged particles and gas molecules is related to the cross section @xmath83 characterizing the process by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the relative velocity and @xmath86 is the number density of the neutral gas .",
    "further , we deal with weakly ionized systems where the interactions of charged particles with one another and with excited molecules is negligible .",
    "our calculation takes into account that the charged particles can loose energy and momentum even in elastic collisions with the gas molecules as the finite mass and the thermal energy of the molecules are taken into account .",
    "the momentum exchange in inelastic collisions is included and @xmath87 denotes the total momentum transfer collision frequency while @xmath88 and @xmath89 are inelastic and superelastic collision frequencies for the inelastic channel @xmath6 .",
    "the total collision frequencies for attachment and ionization are denoted by @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "we consider only single ionization with ionization energy @xmath92 , but the resulting ion can be left in any one of its internal excited states , characterized by an excitation energy @xmath93 and a collision frequency @xmath94 .",
    "the momentum transfer theory has a long history in kinetic theory of gases and has proved very successful for describing charged particle transport in gases under the influence of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "it is discussed comprehensively in the textbook of mason and mcdaniel @xcite and in references @xcite .",
    "the main ideas can be briefly summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) we need to express the average collision frequencies as a function of the mean energy in the center - of - mass reference frame .",
    "thus , we replace the variables @xmath95 in expressions for collisional frequencies @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the energy measured in the center - of - mass reference frame and @xmath98 is the reduced mass .",
    "\\(2 ) if we assume that the dominant contributions to the averages come from regions near the mean energy @xmath99 , and that @xmath100 varies sufficiently slowly with @xmath97 , then a taylor expansion @xmath101 is expected to be a reasonable approximation . for conservative collisional processes such as elastic and inelastic scattering , only the first term of the expansion ( [ 2.4.2.3 ] ) is considered .",
    "however , when energy - dependent non - conservative processes such as ionization and electron attachment are operative then the derivative term in ( [ 2.4.2.3 ] ) becomes the leading term and must be included .",
    "\\(3 ) using the momentum transfer approximation , the balance equations ( [ 2.3.1])-([2.3.4 ] ) get the form @xmath102 @xmath103\\ ; , \\label{2.4.2.5}\\ ] ] @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath97 is the average electron energy , @xmath106 is the average electron energy flux and @xmath107 is the mass of gas molecules .",
    "@xmath108 is given by @xcite : @xmath109 the average collision frequencies for momentum and energy transfer @xmath110 @xmath111 are prescribed functions of the mean energy in the centre - off - mass frame @xmath112 where @xmath54 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath113 is the neutral gas temperature .",
    "other collision frequencies describing the inelastic , non - conservative and superelastic collisions appearing in equations ( [ 2.4.2.4])-([2.4.2.7 ] ) are also functions of @xmath99 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the equations of continuity ( [ 2.4.2.4 ] ) , of momentum balance ( [ 2.4.2.5 ] ) and of energy balance ( [ 2.4.2.6 ] ) are valid for charged particles of arbitrary mass while the energy flux equation ( [ 2.4.2.7 ] ) is obtained in the approximation of @xmath114 .",
    "high - order corrections in momentum transfer theory corrections ( e.g. , high - order terms in the taylor expansion ( [ 2.4.2.3 ] ) ) could be added on the right - hand side of the system ( [ 2.4.2.4])-([2.4.2.7 ] ) if desired , without in any way changing the generality of the physical arguments associated with the closure assumptions presented below .",
    "the closure of the system of equations ( [ 2.4.2.4])-([2.4.2.7 ] ) requires approximations or assumptions on the form of the pressure tensor .",
    "the standard approximation for light particles such as electrons is that the pressure tensor can be taken as a scalar at the fluid level of approximation @xcite .",
    "this means that , @xmath115 , and the pressure tensor simplifies to @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the so - called temperature tensor that characterizes energy fluctuations even if the system is not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this form of the pressure tensor was employed in all previous swarm oriented studies @xcite , as well as in the recent fluid models of streamer discharges @xcite . however",
    ", if the velocity distribution significantly deviates from isotropy in velocity space , then this approximation is problematic . for ions ,",
    "the distribution function in velocity space is always anisotropic ( even if elastic collisions between ions and molecules are predominant ) and hence any assumption on an isotropic pressure tensor is wrong for ions .",
    "this problem can be avoided by considering the temperature tensor balance equation but this in turn contains further unknowns .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for how to treat charged particle swarms under spatially - homogeneous hydrodynamic conditions . in streamer studies , the ions are usually considered as immobile or they are modeled by a reaction - drift - diffusion and local field approximation which is a reasonable approximation on the time scale on which a streamer ionization front passes a given point in space .",
    "the next step in the closure of the system of equations ( [ 2.4.2.4])-([2.4.2.7 ] ) concerns the energy flux balance equation ( [ 2.4.2.7 ] ) . the third term can be simplified as follows : @xmath118 where @xmath53 is the unity tensor .",
    "assuming again as in ( [ 2.4.3.1 ] ) that the temperature tensor is isotropic , and hence that @xmath119 and after some algebra , the energy flux equation can be written as @xmath120    the second term in the energy flux balance equation ( [ 2.4.3.3 ] ) or ( [ 2.4.2.7 ] ) is the divergence of the fourth power of the velocity averaged over the velocity distribution , @xmath121 , while all other terms in the equation contain only the third power of velocity .",
    "therefore this term , that we will call the quartic tensor , requires either the next equation in the sequence of moment equations or a closure approximation",
    ". this closure assumption must be physically transparent and consistent with the general structure of the equations .",
    "one way is to approximate the relevant term by a product of lower moments as @xmath122 where we used ( [ cc ] ) for the second equality .",
    "@xmath123 is a parametrization factor , generically close to unity , when the higher order correlation term @xmath124 can be neglected .    with these closure assumptions",
    "the system of fluid equations ( [ 2.4.2.4])-([2.4.2.7 ] ) for the electrons becomes : @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 the parameter @xmath123 that appears in the energy flux equation is a quantity close to unity , but can be used to fit the neglected higher order correlations",
    ". variations of this parameter will be discussed in our second paper  @xcite .",

    "we note that swarm transport data are usually given in the literature in the form of tables as a function of reduced electric field , @xmath129 @xcite . in fluid plasma modeling",
    ", however , several important issues have to be considered before directly implementing data from the literature .",
    "first , transport coefficients are defined far from boundaries , sources and sinks of charged particles where the so - called hydrodynamic conditions prevail @xcite . under hydrodynamic conditions ,",
    "the space - time dependence of the distribution function is expressible in terms of linear functionals of @xmath130 .",
    "a sufficient functional relationship between the distribution function @xmath24 and @xmath130 in the case of weak gradients is the well - known expansion @xmath131 where @xmath132 are tensors of rank @xmath133 and @xmath134 denotes an @xmath133-fold scalar product",
    ". direct application of transport properties measured / calculated in different experimental arrangements where often non - hydrodynamic conditions are present explicitly or implicitly , is problematic and should be avoided .",
    "typical example of swarm data obtained under non - hydrodynamic conditions are those measured / calculated under the steady - state townsend ( sst ) conditions @xcite .",
    "before direct application of sst data one must perform careful swarm analysis and convert the sst data into the hydrodynamic transport coefficients .",
    "details of this procedure are presented in @xcite .",
    "second , care must be taken when non - conservative collisions are significant . in the presence of non - conservative collisions",
    "there are two sets of transport coefficients , the bulk and the flux @xcite .",
    "assuming the functional relationship ( [ 2.1.43 ] ) the flux @xmath135 and source term @xmath136 ( usually denoted by @xmath137 in previous swarm oriented studies @xcite ) appearing in the equation of continuity ( [ 2.2.1 ] ) can be expanded @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 define , respectively , the flux drift velocity and flux diffusion tensor while @xmath141 are expansion coefficients of the source term .",
    "substitution of expansions ( [ 2.1.43a ] ) and ( [ 2.1.43b ] ) into the continuity equation ( [ 2.2.1 ] ) yields the diffusion equation @xmath142 which defines the bulk transport coefficients @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the loss rate , @xmath145 is the bulk drift velocity and @xmath68 is the bulk diffusion tensor .",
    "the basic difference between the bulk and flux transport coefficients should now be apparent .",
    "the bulk drift velocity is displacement of the mean position of the electron swarm and it characterizes the motion of the total ensemble of electrons .",
    "the presence of the electric field results in a spatial variation in the energy throughout the swarm . under such conditions ,",
    "the presence of non - conservative collisions ( ionization/ attachment ) may lead to a change in the position of the center - of - mass of the swarm .",
    "this effect on the bulk drift velocity is denoted by @xmath146 . on the other hand",
    ", the flux drift velocity @xmath139 represents the rate of change of the position of the center - of - mass due to the electric field only and can be interpreted as the mean velocity of the electrons .",
    "likewise the flux diffusion tensor @xmath140 represents the rate of spreading of the swarm due to the electric field @xmath1 and gradients in density @xmath147 .",
    "the presence of non - conservative collisions may result in the variation of @xmath147 throughout the swarm and a subsequent variation in the rate of change of the mean squared width of the swarm .",
    "such effects are expressed by the second rank tensor @xmath148 .",
    "the most appropriate procedure in plasma modeling would be to use the experimental swarm data ( e.g. bulk values ) for the analysis of the validity of the cross section and then to calculate the flux quantities which are necessary as input data in fluid modeling .",
    "more about duality of the hydrodynamic transport coefficients and their implementation in fluid modeling can be found in the references @xcite .",
    "third , while the first order fluid model requires electron transport data as a function of local reduced electric field , what really appears in high order fluid models are mean - energy - dependent collisional rates .",
    "since momentum transfer theory is used to determine the collision terms in the fluid equations , the most appropriate procedure would be to systematically reduce these fluid equations down to the swarm limit assuming the hydrodynamic regime . from this set of equations",
    ", one can then find relationships between collisional transfer rates and the mean energy , in a self - consistent manner .",
    "this method was employed in previous works of robson and co - workers ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , but we apply here a slightly different approach . instead of using the so - called generalized einstein relation to determine the mean energy from the transverse diffusion coefficient @xcite , the mean energy is directly calculated from the multi term solution of boltzmann s equation .",
    "the correspondence between the mean energy and @xmath129 is then used to find the correspondence between the mean energy and other relevant transport data .",
    "the momentum transfer collision rate is obtained from @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the electron mobility which is here a function of the mean energy .",
    "the energy - transfer collision frequency is calculated from equation ( [ 2.4.2.10 ] ) .",
    "thus our procedure of determining the electron transport data as an input for high order fluid models is entirely consistent with the work of boeuf and pitchford @xcite .",
    "the electron transport data employed in this work are calculated using a multi term theory for solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "the methods and techniques are by now standard and the reader is referred to our previous works @xcite . among many important aspects ,",
    "we highlight the following important steps :    * no assumptions on symmetries in velocity space are made , and the directional dependence of the phase - space distribution function in velocity space is represented in terms of a spherical harmonic expansion : @xmath151}(\\hat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath\\/${c}$}}})\\ , , \\label{2.1.42}\\ ] ] where @xmath152}(\\hat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath\\/${c}$}}})$ ] are spherical harmonics and @xmath153 represents the angles of @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to the classical two term theory ( where the sum over @xmath154 is performed only up to @xmath155 ) , the number of spherical harmonics is not restricted , and our method therefore is a truly multi term approach .",
    "the differences between two - term approximation and our full multi term approach for electron transport in nitrogen are illustrated in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the inadequacies of a legendre polynomial expansion ( when density gradients are not parallel to the field ) are highlighted in our previous publications @xcite and avoided in this work . *",
    "as discussed above , under hydrodynamic conditions a sufficient representation of the space dependence is an expansion in terms of powers of the density gradient operator . *",
    "the velocity ( energy ) dependence of the phase - space distribution function is represented by an expansion about a maxwellian at an arbitrary temperature in terms of sonine polynomials .    using the appropriate orthogonality relations for the spherical harmonics and for the modified sonine polynomials , the boltzmann equation is converted into a hierarchy of coupled equations for the moments of the distribution function .",
    "these equations are solved numerically and all transport and rate coefficients are expressed in terms of moments of the distribution function @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "transport and reaction coefficients for electrons in n@xmath156 at a temperature of 298 k are calculated as an input for first and high order fluid models .",
    "the first order model is based on the local field approximation ; it requires mobility , diffusion coefficient and ionization rate as a function of the reduced electric field @xmath129 ( where @xmath157 is the gas number density ) . compared to our previous work @xcite , we extend the electric field range up to 3000 td ( 1 td=@xmath158 vm@xmath159 ) .",
    "the high order fluid model requires average collision frequencies for momentum and energy transfer in elastic and inelastic collisions , and rate coefficients for all collision processes as a function of the mean electron energy .",
    "we use the cross sections for electron scattering in n@xmath156 provided by stojanovi and petrovi @xcite . for elastic collision processes we use the original boltzmann collision operator @xcite while for inelastic processes we employ the generalization of wang - chang _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the ionization collision operator is detailed in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the ratio between the energy of the scattered electron and the total available energy in an ionizing collision is equally distributed between 0 and 1 ; the same holds then , of course , for the ejected electron .",
    "we remark that at the high electron energies in the streamer tip , the assumptions on the energy division can considerably influence transport profiles . furthermore",
    ", scattering is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "this can be problematic for high values of @xmath129 ( generally for @xmath160 td for electrons in n@xmath156 ) when electrons scatter predominantly in the forward direction @xcite .",
    "however , the errors in the calculated transport coefficients and rate coefficients are acceptable in fluid modeling for streamers in the range of the reduced electric fields @xmath129 considered in this work after appropriate renormalization of cross - sections for the scattering angle distribution @xcite .",
    "we present both _",
    "bulk _ and _ flux _ coefficients obtained by our multi term solution of the boltzmann equation , and we compare them with the coefficients obtained by the public available boltzmann solver bolsig+ derived from the same cross sections .",

    "figure 1a shows the electron mobility as a function of the reduced electric field @xmath129 .",
    "we observe that bulk and flux quantities start to differ visibly above a reduced field of approximately 150 td , this means that the ionization processes start to be significant at this value of the field . as @xmath129 increases further ,",
    "the effect becomes more pronounced , until the bulk mobility exceeds the flux mobility by approximately 30% at 3000 td .",
    "the difference between bulk and flux mobility is the consequence of the spatial variation of the average electron energy within an electron swarm @xcite .",
    "if the ionization rate is an increasing function of electron energy ( as is the case for the parameters considered here ) , electrons are preferentially created in regions of higher energy resulting in a shift in the centre of mass position as well as in a modification of the spread about the centre of mass . in nitrogen up to 3000 td , the electrons are preferentially created at the leading edge of an electron swarm and hence the bulk mobility is larger than the flux mobility .

    "the diffusion coefficients are more sensitive to the ionization processes than the mobility ; the differences between bulk and flux data can reach almost 50% for @xmath129 approaching 3000 td . for a more thorough analysis of the explicit influence of ionization processes on the diffusion",
    "coefficients one must consider the second order variations in the average energy along the swarm .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this work and we defer this to a future study .    figure 1b clearly shows the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor , i.e. @xmath161 ; for the rage of @xmath129 considered here , the transverse diffusion coefficient is always larger than the longitudinal diffusion coefficient .",
    "this is due to the spatial variation of the average energy within the swarm and to the energy dependence of the collision frequency .",
    "the theory of anisotropic diffusion in an electric field is now textbook material ( see for example @xcite ) and rather than a detailed discussion of the origin of this phenomenon , we prefer to highlight the implementation of the diffusion coefficients in fluid models of streamer discharges . for @xmath129 below approximately 30 td , our results for the flux component of the transverse diffusion coefficient and those obtained by the bolsig+ code agree very well .",
    "for @xmath129 above 30 td , however , bolsig+ with its two term approximation is clearly above our multi term solution .",
    "here one should bear in mind that bolsig+ treats the diffusion processes under the spatially homogeneous conditions and hence the transverse diffusion coefficient obtained under the spatially - inhomogeneous conditions should be used for comparisons . on the other hand , our one - dimensional fluid model requires the longitudinal diffusion coefficient as an input as we consider the spatial variations of the electron density and average electron energy only along the field direction .",
