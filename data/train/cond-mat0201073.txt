    "the flow of a dc current in response to a slowly - varying time - dependent potential operating on an _ un - biased _ system is termed ",
    "adiabatic charge pumping \" .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon , first considered in ref . ,",
    "has attracted recently much theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite interest . in general ,  adiabatic pumping \" occurs when the charge transferred across a boundary during a single period of a certain modulating potential is independent of the modulation frequency .",
    "this process is adiabatic in the sense that the periodic potential varies very slowly in time , such that its frequency @xmath0 is smaller than any characteristic energy scale of the electrons .",
    "eighteen years ago , thouless @xcite has shown , using the adiabatic approximation , that the ground state of an infinite one - dimensional ( 1d ) system of non - interacting electrons subject to a slowly moving periodic potential can support a dc current .",
    "later theoretical investigations of quantum pumping in confined nanostructures have employed the result derived by brouwer , @xcite which gives the pumped charge in terms of the time - dependent scattering matrix related to the modulating potential .",
    "the derivation presented by brouwer is based on the analysis of ref . ,",
    "which , in turn , utilizes an expansion in the amplitude of the modulating potential in the context of time - dependent scattering theory .",
    "nevertheless , it is generally accepted that the formalism of bttiker _",
    "_ @xcite and the resulting brouwer formula are valid @xcite even for large amplitudes , as long as the adiabatic approximation holds",
    ".    this paper is devoted , among other issues , to the exploration of this point .",
    "we consider a spatially - confined system of non - interacting electrons , connected by leads ( denoted by @xmath1 ) to electronic reservoirs which are kept at various chemical potentials , @xmath2 .",
    "the system is also subject to a slowly - varying periodic potential .",
    "we derive an expression for the instantaneous current flowing in this system , allowing for arbitrary strengths of the modulating potential , using time - dependent scattering states .",
    "the formalism is based on an iterative solution of those states , in the adiabatic approximation , in which the temporal derivative of the scattering potential ( and the scattering states ) is the small parameter .",
    "the formal derivation is summarized in sec .",
    "ii , where we obtain the instantaneous current in the lowest - order adiabatic approximation .",
    "this current is averaged over a single period of the modulating potential . in this way we obtain the effect of the chemical potential bias on the pumped charge on one hand , and the modification of the landauer formula caused by the modulating potential on the other .",
    "we find a new expression for the charge pumped through an un - biased system [ see eq .",
    "( [ intpump ] ) below ] , which is particularly useful in cases where the modulating potential operates on the entire nanostructure , @xcite and is spatially - dependent .",
    "the appendix includes the derivation of the next order correction to the current .",
    "we investigate the lowest - order expression for the current in sec .",
    "iii , confining ourselves for simplicity to a system connected to two reservoirs .",
    "our results there can be summarized as follow . in a two - terminal structure ,",
    "the current averaged over a single period , @xmath3 , consists of two parts .",
    "the first , denoted by @xmath4 , flows even when the system is un - biased , ( but is modified by the presence of the chemical potential difference ) . to the lowest order in the adiabatic approximation , that current reads @xmath5,\\label{intpump}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the left and the right leads , respectively , and @xmath8 are the fermi distributions in the reservoirs connected to the left and right leads . in eq .",
    "( [ intpump ] ) , @xmath9 is the instantaneous scattering state at time @xmath10 , excited by an incoming wave in channel @xmath11 of lead @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the temporal derivative of the time - dependent scattering potential .",
    "interestingly enough , the matrix element appearing in eq .",
    "( [ intpump ] ) can be written in terms of the instantaneous scattering matrix , reproducing the brouwer formula , @xcite and vindicating its use for arbitrary amplitudes .",
    "the second part of the current , denoted by @xmath14 , flows only when the system is biased , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "when this current is integrated over a single period , @xmath3 , of the modulating potential , one obtains the landauer formula , modified by the modulated potential in two ways : ( i ) the transmission coefficient is the instantaneous one , @xmath16 , averaged over a single period of the time - dependent potential ; ( ii ) there appears a correction to the landauer expression , which is related to the temporal derivative of the modulating potential and the ensuing instantaneous scattering matrix . in the simplest case in which the two leads are single - channel ones , @xmath14 takes a particularly simple form , @xmath17\\bigl ( f_{\\ell}(e)-f_{r}(e)\\bigr ) , \\label{landauer}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath18 is the instantaneous friedel phase ( i.e. , the transmission phase ) of the nanostructure . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ landauer ] ) yields the landauer formula for the present case . the second term there is a correction , which is discussed in sec .",
    "iii , using a simple example .",
    "in the first part of this section we solve for the time - dependent scattering states iteratively , using the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we then use those scattering states in the second part , to obtain the current .",
    "the formalism presented below borrows from the derivations in refs . and , extended to include the effect of a time - dependent scattering potential .",
    "we consider a ballistic nanostructure of arbitrary geometry , which consists of a nanostructure connected to several electronic reservoirs .",
    "this system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath19 where the scattering potential @xmath20 is assumed to be confined in space , so that asymptotic behaviors of the scattering solutions can be defined un - ambiguously .",
    "this confined region is attached to leads , numbered by the index @xmath1 , and each lead is connected to a reservoir having the chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath21 consists of the kinetic energy .",
    "we use the adiabatic approximation , requiring that the characteristic inverse time - constant , @xmath22 , which describes the time dependence of @xmath23 , is smaller than any characteristic energy scale of the electrons . for a simple oscillatory potential , @xmath24 .    as in the usual scattering treatment",
    ", we denote the incoming wave with energy @xmath25 in lead @xmath1 by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the transverse mode number .",
    "this wave is a solution of the free hamiltonian , @xmath28 and is normalized such that it carries a unit flux .",
    "the scattering solution of the full hamiltonian , excited by this incoming wave , can be written in the form @xmath29 the time dependence of the scattered wave function , @xmath30 , is expected to have the same characteristic time scale as @xmath23 .",
    "for example , when the modulating potential is oscillating in time , @xmath31 contains all harmonics of the frequency @xmath0 .    the scattering solution @xmath32 should satisfy the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath33 inserting ( [ scatsol ] ) into ( [ sch ] ) , using eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) , we find @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the instantaneous green function of the full hamiltonian , such that @xmath36    we now solve eq .",
    "( [ chitild ] ) , using the adiabatic approximation : the temporal derivative appearing on the right - hand - side of that equation is regarded as a small correction ( of order @xmath22 ) , and the equation is solved iteratively .",
    "the zeroth - order is just the instantaneous scattering solution , which we denote by @xmath37 , @xmath38 the instantaneous scattering state @xmath37 is the solution of the instantaneous schrdinger equation , with energy @xmath25 , @xmath39 turning back to eq .",
    "( [ chitild ] ) , one finds that to first order in the time - derivative the scattering solution reads @xmath40 in which @xmath41 is the time - derivative of the instantaneous scattering state .",
    "hence , to first order in the adiabatic approximation the time - dependent scattering states are given entirely in terms of the _ instantaneous _ solutions ( namely , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) of the problem at hand .",
    "one notes that the adiabatic solution ( [ sol ] ) of the scattering state is analogous to thouless @xcite solution for the ground - state wave function in his model . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss the corrections to the lowest order adiabatic approximation .      here",
    "we outline the derivation of the current in the scattering states formalism , as developed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "one writes the field operator of the electron , @xmath44 , in terms of the scattering states as @xmath45 in which @xmath46 destroys an electron incoming in channel @xmath27 of lead @xmath1 .",
    "the thermal average of the latter operators is given by the fermi distributions of the various reservoirs , such that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fermi distribution in the reservoir connected to the @xmath1 lead .",
    "with these definitions , the thermal average of the current density operator becomes @xmath49 where @xmath50 stands for the negative electron charge .",
    "it is convenient to evaluate this quantity when @xmath51 approaches @xmath52 in lead @xmath12 ( which will be denoted by @xmath53 ) , and then to integrate the current density over the cross - section of that lead ( noting that the incoming and outgoing waves are normalized to carry a unit flux ) . in so doing , we may take advantage of the asymptotic properties of the instantaneous quantities @xmath37 and @xmath54 , as documented in refs . and",
    ", @xmath55 here , @xmath56 is the outgoing wave in channel @xmath11 of lead @xmath12 and @xmath57 is the matrix element of the instantaneous scattering matrix . as a result , the current flowing into lead @xmath12 is given by @xmath58 \\biggr ) , \\label{gencur}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath59 the result ( [ gencur ] ) for the time - dependent current entering into lead @xmath12 of the nanostructure holds for a general biased system , whose various terminals have different chemical potentials ( as long as the time - dependence of the periodic potential is slow enough ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider charge conservation , using that result .",
    "indeed , summing ( [ gencur ] ) over all leads , we obtain @xmath60 which shows that when the total current entering the system , @xmath61 , is integrated over a single period of the modulating potential , the result is zero , i.e. , the charge per period is conserved . in deriving the result ( [ chacon ] ) we have employed ( i ) the unitarity of the instantaneous scattering matrix , @xmath62 ; and ( ii ) the following property of the scattering matrix @xcite @xmath63    equation ( [ gencur ] ) can be considered as a generalization of the landauer formula , extended to include the effect of a time - dependent potential , in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the new ingredient is the quantity @xmath64 , eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) .",
    "this quantity can be expressed in terms of the temporal derivative of the scattering potential , @xmath65 to prove this , we take the temporal derivative of eq .",
    "( [ chiteq ] ) , and use eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) , to obtain @xmath66 we insert this expression into eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , and carry out one of the spatial integrations using @xmath67 which follows directly by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ chiteq ] ) with respect to the energy , and using eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) and the symmetry of the green function @xmath68 .",
    "this produces the result ( [ uder ] ) .",
    "let us now confine ourselves to a nanostructure connected to two terminals , with left ( @xmath69 ) and right ( @xmath7 ) leads .",
    "then we can use eq .",
    "( [ gencur ] ) to write the current entering the system from the left terminal in the form @xmath70.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an analogous expression holds for @xmath71 .",
    "the net current flowing in the system during a single period of the modulating potential then consists of two parts , @xmath72 where the first , @xmath14 , flows only when the system is biased , whereas the second , @xmath4 , is established by the time - dependent potential ( though it is affected by the chemical potential difference , when the latter is applied ) . using eqs .",
    "( [ sums ] ) and ( [ uder ] ) , the pumped current , @xmath4 , takes the form @xmath73 . \\label{ipump}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the biased current we find @xmath74.\\label{ibias}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the pumped part of the current , @xmath4 , can be written in terms of the temporal derivatives of the instantaneous scattering matrix . in order to vindicate this statement",
    ", we start from the asymptotic form for @xmath75 , eq .",
    "( [ asymp ] ) , for the wave going from lead @xmath1 into lead @xmath12 .",
    "noting that @xmath76 we conclude that @xmath77 differentiating this expression with respect to time and using eqs .",

    "( [ sums ] ) , by which @xmath79 then , multiplying by @xmath80 and summing over @xmath1 and @xmath27 yields @xmath81 one notes that this identity makes the expression for @xmath82 , eq .",
    "( [ ipump ] ) above , to be identical with the brouwer @xcite formula , in the case where the system is un - biased .    in the simplest case where each of the leads is a single - channel one , the expression for the current takes a particularly simple form .",

    "the reflection phase @xmath86 describes the asymmetry of the nanostructure .",
    "a finite time - dependent reflection phase is a necessary ingredient to obtain the pumped current .",
    "finally , @xmath18 is the transmission ( friedel ) phase . with the parametrization eq .",
    "( [ smatrix ] ) one finds , using eqs .",

    "the second term forms a correction to this result , brought about by the modulating potential .",
    "the pumped charge is given by @xmath91 ( see ref . ) , and it vanishes unless @xmath86 is time - dependent .      clearly , a comparison between @xmath92 and the second part of @xmath93 is called for .",
    "consider for simplicity zero temperature .",
    "then , @xmath92 is given by the values of @xmath94 at @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the chemical potential difference , and @xmath97 denotes the fermi level . on the other hand , the second term in @xmath93 is given by @xmath98 $ ] , and hence should be much smaller than the landauer contribution , which is proportional to @xmath99 . nevertheless , it may be of interest to explore this term experimentally , as it is related to the friedel phase of the nanostructure .    to further explore this point , we consider the following simple example : a quantum dot , with a single localized level , coupled to two ideal 1d leads .",
    "@xcite adopting the tight - binding description , we model the two leads connecting the quantum dot to the electronic reservoirs by 1d chains of sites , whose on - site energies are assumed to vanish , and whose nearest - neighbor transfer amplitudes are denoted by @xmath100 .",
    "thus the energy of an electron of wave vector @xmath101 moving on such a chain is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the lattice constant . the localized level , of energy @xmath104 , is attached to the left - hand - side lead with matrix element @xmath105 , and to the right - hand - side lead with matrix element @xmath106 .",
    "the latter two quantities are assumed to vary slowly in time , in a periodic way .",

    "note that these two parameters can be thought of as the ` contact conductances ' of the quantum dot .",

    "@xcite in the present model ,",
    "that line is given by @xmath118 we will elaborate on this point , which is exemplified in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] this integral vanishes .",
    "hence , in such a symmetric configuration , there will be no deviation from the landauer formula due to the temporal variation of the friedel phase .",
    "one may conclude from this example that when the pumping orbit in the plane of the time - dependent parameters is not so simple as the one considered above , there might be a small correction , related to the asymmetry of the orbit .",
    "the motivation of this work is mainly to examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation in calculating the charge pumped quantum - mechanically through a confined system of non - interacting electrons , and to study the effects of a constant bias . to this end , we have derived the time - dependent current generated when the system is subject to a slowly - changing modulating potential , in addition to being connected to reservoirs of different chemical potentials .",
    "we have found that the widely - used brouwer formula which gives the pumped charge in terms of the instantaneous scattering matrix is valid for arbitrary amplitudes of the modulating potential , as long as the lowest - order adiabatic approximation can be employed .    in the process , we have obtained an alternative expression for the pumped charge , eq .",
    "( [ intpump ] ) , which gives it in terms of matrix elements of the temporal derivative of the potential between the instantaneous scattering states .",
    "we have also derived and analyzed the effects of the modulating potential on the biased current , and showed them to be quite small .",

    "<S> corrections to the adiabatic approximation are derived and discussed .    2 </S>"
