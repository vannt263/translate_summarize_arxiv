    "the cosmological constant ( cc ) problem @xcite-@xcite , the accelerated expansion of the late time universe@xcite , the cosmic coincidence @xcite are challenges for the foundations of modern physics ( see also reviews on dark energy@xcite-@xcite , dark matter @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerous models have been proposed with the aim to find answer to these puzzles , for example : the quintessence@xcite , coupled quintessence@xcite , @xmath3-essence@xcite,@xcite , variable mass particles@xcite , interacting quintessence@xcite , chaplygin gas@xcite , phantom field@xcite , tachyon matter cosmology@xcite , abnormally weighting energy hypothesis@xcite , brane world scenarios@xcite , etc .. these puzzles have also motivated an interest in modifications and even radical revisions of the standard gravitational theory ( general relativity ( gr))@xcite,@xcite . although motivations for most of these models can be found in fundamental theories like for example in brane world@xcite , the questions concerning the einstein gr limit and relation to the regular particle physics , like standard model , still remain unclear .",
    "one can add to the list of puzzles the problem of initial singularity@xcite,@xcite , including the singularity theorems for scalar field - driven inflationary cosmology@xcite , resolution of which is perhaps a crucial criteria for the true theory .",
    "it is very hard to imagine that it is possible to propose ideas which are able to solve the above mentioned problems keeping at the same time unchanged the basis of fundamental physics , i.e. gravity and particle field theory .",
    "this paper may be regarded as _",
    "an attempt to find a way for satisfactory answers at least to a part of the fundamental questions on the basis of first principles , i.e. without using semi - empirical models_. in this paper we explore a toy model including gravity and a single scalar field @xmath0 in the framework of the so called two measures field theory ( tmt)@xcite-@xcite . in tmt , gravity ( or more exactly , geometry ) and particle field theory intertwined in a very non trivial manner , but the fifth force problem is resolved and the einstein s gr is restored when the local fermion matter energy density ( i.e in the space - time regions occupied by the fermions ) is much larger than the vacuum energy density@xcite,@xcite .    here",
    "we _ have no purpose _ of constructing a complete realistic cosmological scenario .",
    "instead , we concentrate our attention on the possible role tmt may play in resolution of a number of the above mentioned problems . all the novelty of the field theory model we will study here results from the peculiar structure of the tmt action while the lagrangian densities do not contain any exotic terms . the model is invariant under global scale transformation of the metric accompanied with an appropriate shift of the dilaton field @xmath0 .",
    "this scale symmetry is spontaneously broken due to intrinsic features of the tmt dynamics .",
    "the obtained dynamics represents an explicit example of @xmath3-essence resulting from first principles .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following .",
    "in sec.ii we present a review of the basic ideas of tmt .",
    "sec.iii starts from formulation of a simple scale invariant model containing all the terms respecting the symmetry of the model but without any exotic terms . in appendix",
    "a we present equations of motion in the original frame . using results of appendix",
    "a , the complete set of equations of motion in the einstein frame is given in sec.iii as well .",
    "it is shown there that if no fine tuning of the parameters is made , the effective action of our model in the einstein frame turns out to be a k - essence type action quadratic in the kinetic term .",
    "we start in sec.iv from a simple case with fine tuned parameters where the non - linear dependence of the kinetic term disappears",
    ". then three different shapes of the effective potential are possible . for the spatially flat frw universe",
    "we study some features of the cosmological dynamics for each of the shapes of the effective potential . for one of the shapes of the effective potential ,",
    "the zero vacuum energy is achieved without fine tuning of dimensionfull parameters , integration constant and initial conditions .    in secs.v , vi and vii",
    "we study the cosmological dynamics of the frw universe without any fine tuning parameters .",
    "the structure of the scalar field phase plane turns out to be very unexpected .",
    "when continuing phase curves to the past , it is revealed that in a finite cosmic time they arrive the repulsive line in the phase plane . the energy density @xmath9 , pressure @xmath10 , the first two derivatives of the scale factor @xmath11 and @xmath12 remain finite on this line but @xmath13 and @xmath14 become singular",
    "the subsequent stage of evolution is characterized by a power law inflation .",
    "depending on the region in the parameter space ( but without fine tuning ) the inflation ends with a graceful exit either into the state with zero cosmological constant ( cc ) , sec.v , or into the state driven by both a small cc and the field @xmath0 with a quintessence - like potential , sec.vi .",
    "the speed @xmath15 of propagation of the cosmological perturbations varies and during the power law inflation @xmath16 .    in sec.vii",
    "we show that there is a wide range of the parameters such that : the equation - of - state in the late time universe @xmath5 ; @xmath6 asymptotically ( as @xmath7 ) approaches @xmath8 from below ; @xmath9 approaches a constant , the smallness of which does not require fine tuning of dimensionfull parameters .",
    "it is shown that there is the possibility of a superacceleration phase of the universe , and some details of the dynamics are explored .",
    "sec.viii is devoted to the resolution of the cc problem . in sec.viiia",
    "we study two ways tmt enables for resolution of the new cc problem without fine tuning of dimensionfull parameters : either by a seesaw type mechanism or due to a correspondence principle between tmt and conventional field theories ( i.e theories with only the measure of integration @xmath4 in the action ) . in sec.viiib",
    "we analyze in detail why the weinberg s no - go cosmological constant theorem@xcite may be nonapplicable in our model .",
    "we analyze also the difference between tmt and conventional field theories ( where only the measure of integration @xmath4 is used in the fundamental action ) which allows to understand why from the point of view of tmt the conventional field theories failed to solve the old cc problem .    in appendix",
    "b we shortly discuss what kind of model one would obtain when choosing fine tuned couplings to the measures of integration in the action .",
    "some additional remarks concerning the relation between the structure of tmt action and the cc problem are given in appendix c. in appendix d we briefly discuss a connection of a particular case of our model with the class of models studied in ref.@xcite",
    "tmt is a generally coordinate invariant theory where _ all the difference from the standard field theory in curved space - time consists only of the following three additional assumptions _ :",
    "the main supposition is that for describing the effective action for gravity @xmath17 matter at energies below the planck scale , the usual form of the action @xmath18 is not complete .",
    "our positive hypothesis is that the effective action has to be of the form@xcite-@xcite @xmath19 including two lagrangians @xmath20 and @xmath21 and two measures of integration @xmath4 and @xmath22 .",
    "one is the usual measure of integration @xmath4 in the 4-dimensional space - time manifold equipped with the metric @xmath23 .",
    "another is the new measure of integration @xmath22 in the same 4-dimensional space - time manifold .",
    "the measure @xmath22 being a scalar density and a total derivative in string and brane theories see ref.@xcite . ] may be defined    * either by means of four scalar fields @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , ( compare with the approach by wilczek ) , @xmath26 * or by means of a totally antisymmetric three index field @xmath27 @xmath28    to provide parity conservation in the case given by eq.([phi ] ) one can choose for example one of @xmath24 s to be a pseudoscalar ; in the case given by eq.([aabg ] ) we must choose @xmath27 to have negative parity .",
    "some ideas concerning the nature of the measure fields @xmath24 are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the idea of t.d .",
    "lee on the possibility of dynamical coordinates@xcite may be related to the measure fields @xmath24 ; see also@xcite and our discussion in sec.ix.c concerning the ideas of ref.@xcite .",
    "a special case of the structure ( [ s ] ) with definition ( [ aabg ] ) has been recently discussed in ref.@xcite in applications to supersymmetric theory and the cc problem .",
    "it is assumed that the lagrangian densities @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions of all matter fields , the dilaton field , the metric , the connection but not of the `` measure fields '' ( @xmath24 or @xmath27 ) .",
    "in such a case , i.e. when the measure fields enter in the theory only via the measure @xmath22 , the action ( [ s ] ) possesses an infinite dimensional symmetry . in the case given by eq.([phi ] ) these symmetry transformations have the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are arbitrary functions of @xmath31 ( see details in ref.@xcite ) ; in the case given by eq.([aabg ] ) they read @xmath32 where @xmath33 are four arbitrary functions of @xmath31 and @xmath34 is numerically the same as @xmath35 .",
    "one can hope that this symmetry should prevent emergence of a measure fields dependence in @xmath20 and @xmath21 after quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "important feature of tmt that is responsible for many interesting and desirable results of the field theory models studied so far@xcite-@xcite consists of the assumption that all fields , including also metric , connection and the _ measure fields _ ( @xmath24 or @xmath27 ) are independent dynamical variables .",
    "all the relations between them are results of equations of motion .",
    "in particular , the independence of the metric and the connection means that we proceed in the first order formalism and the relation between connection and metric is not necessarily according to riemannian geometry .",
    "we want to stress again that except for the listed three assumptions we do not make any changes as compared with principles of the standard field theory in curved space - time . in other words , all the freedom in constructing different models in the framework of tmt consists of the choice of the concrete matter content and the lagrangians @xmath20 and @xmath21 that is quite similar to the standard field theory .",
    "since @xmath22 is a total derivative , a shift of @xmath31 by a constant , @xmath36 , has no effect on the equations of motion .",
    "similar shift of @xmath21 would lead to the change of the constant part of the lagrangian coupled to the volume element @xmath37 . in the standard",
    "gr , this constant term is the cosmological constant . however in tmt the relation between the constant term of @xmath21 and the physical cosmological constant is very non trivial ( see @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite ) .    in the case of the definition of @xmath22 by means of eq.([phi ] ) , varying the measure fields @xmath24 , we get @xmath38 since @xmath39 it follows that if @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a constant of integration with the dimension of mass . in what follows",
    "we make the choice @xmath44 .    in the case of the definition ( [ aabg ] ) , variation of @xmath27 yields @xmath45 that implies eq.([varphi ] ) without the condition @xmath40 needed in the model with four scalar fields @xmath24 .",
    "one should notice _ the very important differences of tmt from scalar - tensor theories with nonminimal coupling _ : + a ) in general , the lagrangian density @xmath31 ( coupled to the measure @xmath22 ) may contain not only the scalar curvature term ( or more general gravity term ) but also all possible matter fields terms .",
    "this means that tmt modifies in general both the gravitational sector and the matter sector ; b ) if the field @xmath22 were the fundamental ( non composite ) one then instead of ( [ varphi ] ) , the variation of @xmath22 would result in the equation @xmath46 and therefore the dimensionfull integration constant @xmath47 would not appear in the theory .",
    "applying the palatini formalism in tmt one can show ( see for example @xcite and appendix a of the present paper ) that in addition to the christoffel s connection coefficients , the resulting relation between connection and metric includes also the gradient of the ratio of the two measures @xmath48 which is a scalar field .",
    "consequently geometry of the space - time with the metric @xmath23 is non - riemannian .",
    "the gravity and matter field equations obtained by means of the first order formalism contain both @xmath49 and its gradient as well .",
    "it turns out that at least at the classical level , the measure fields affect the theory only through the scalar field @xmath49 .",
    "the consistency condition of equations of motion has the form of a constraint which determines @xmath50 as a function of matter fields .",
    "the surprising feature of the theory is that neither newton constant nor curvature appear in this constraint which means that the _ geometrical scalar field _",
    "@xmath50 _ is determined by the matter fields configuration _ locally and straightforward ( that is without gravitational interaction ) .    by an appropriate change of the dynamical variables which includes a transformation of the metric",
    ", one can formulate the theory in a riemannian space - time . the corresponding frame we call `` the einstein frame '' .",
    "the big advantage of tmt is that in the very wide class of models , _ the gravity and all matter fields equations of motion take canonical gr form in the einstein frame_. all the novelty of tmt in the einstein frame as compared with the standard gr is revealed only in an unusual structure of the scalar fields effective potential ( produced in the einstein frame ) , masses of fermions and their interactions with scalar fields as well as in the unusual structure of fermion contributions to the energy - momentum tensor : all these quantities appear to be @xmath49 dependent@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is why the scalar field @xmath50 determined by the constraint as a function of matter fields , has a key role in the dynamics of tmt models .",
    "the tmt models possessing a global scale invariance@xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite are of significant interest because they demonstrate the possibility of spontaneous breakdown of the scale symmetry .",
    "in fact , if the action ( [ s ] ) is scale invariant then this classical field theory effect results from eq.([varphi ] ) , namely from solving the equation of motion ( [ varphib ] ) or ( [ adl1 ] ) . one of the interesting applications of the scale invariant tmt models@xcite is a possibility to generate the exponential potential for the scalar field @xmath0 by means of the mentioned spontaneous symmetry breaking even without introducing any potentials for @xmath0 in the lagrangians @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the action ( [ s ] ) . some cosmological applications of this effect have been studied in ref.@xcite ( see also appendix d of the present paper ) .",
    "a dilaton field @xmath0 allows to realize a spontaneously broken global scale invariance@xcite and together with this it governs the evolution of the universe on different stages : in the early universe @xmath0 plays the role of inflaton and in the late time universe it is transformed into a part of the dark energy .",
    "according to the general prescriptions of tmt , we have to start from studying the self - consistent system of gravity ( metric @xmath23 and connection @xmath51 ) , the measure @xmath22 degrees of freedom ( i.e. measure fields @xmath52 or @xmath27 ) and the dilaton field @xmath0 proceeding in the first order formalism .",
    "we postulate that the theory is invariant under the global scale transformations : @xmath53 if the definition ( [ aabg ] ) is used for the measure @xmath22 then the transformations of @xmath24 in ( [ st ] ) should be changed by @xmath54 .",
    "this global scale invariance includes the shift symmetry of the dilaton @xmath0 and this is the main factor why it is important for cosmological applications of the theory@xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we choose an action which , except for the modification of the general structure caused by the basic assumptions of tmt , _ does not contain any exotic terms and fields _ as like in the conventional formulation of the minimally coupled scalar - gravity system . keeping the general structure ( [ s ] )",
    ", it is convenient to represent the underlying action of our model in the following form : @xmath55   \\label{totaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the action ( [ totaction ] ) there are two types of the gravitational terms and of the `` kinetic - like terms '' which respect the scale invariance : the terms of the one type coupled to the measure @xmath22 and those of the other type coupled to the measure @xmath4 . using the freedom in normalization of the measure fields ( @xmath24 in the case of using eq.([phi ] ) or @xmath27 when using eq.([aabg ] ) ) , we set the coupling constant of the scalar curvature to the measure @xmath22 to be @xmath56 . normalizing all the fields such that their couplings to the measure @xmath22 have no additional factors , we are not able in general to provide the same in the terms describing the appropriate couplings to the measure @xmath4 . this fact explains the need to introduce the dimensionless real parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 and we will only assume and @xmath58 : one can normalize all the fields such that their couplings to the measure @xmath4 have no additional factors . then generically one should introduce arbitrary dimensionless coupling constants to the measure @xmath22 .",
    "it is clear that if for example the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 in ( [ totaction ] ) are large then the new parameters would be small and vice versa . such formulation of the underlying action results in the model equivalent to the model ( [ totaction ] ) . ]",
    "that _ they are positive and have close orders of magnitudes_. note that in the case of the choice @xmath59 we would proceed with _ the fine tuned model_. the real positive parameter @xmath60 is assumed to be of the order of unity ; in all numerical solutions presented in this paper we set @xmath61 . for the newton constant we use @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "one should also point out the possibility of introducing two different pre - potentials which are exponential functions of the dilaton @xmath0 coupled to the measures @xmath22 and @xmath4 with factors @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "such @xmath0-dependence provides the scale symmetry ( [ st ] ) .",
    "however @xmath64 and @xmath65 might be higgs - dependent and then they play the role of the higgs pre - potentials@xcite .      in appendix",
    "a we present the equations of motion resulting from the action ( [ totaction ] ) when using the original set of variables",
    ". the common feature of all the equations in the original frame is that the measure @xmath22 degrees of freedom appear only through dependence upon the scalar field @xmath49 , eq.([zeta ] ) .",
    "in particular , all the equations of motion and the solution for the connection coefficients include terms proportional to @xmath66 , that makes space - time non riemannian and all equations of motion - noncanonical .",
    "it turns out that when working with the new metric ( @xmath0 remains the same ) @xmath67 which we call the einstein frame , the connection becomes riemannian . since @xmath68 is invariant under the scale transformations ( [ st ] ) , spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry ( by means of eq.([varphi ] ) which for our model ( [ totaction ] ) takes the form ( [ app1 ] ) ) is reduced in the einstein frame to the _ spontaneous breakdown of the shift symmetry _",
    "@xmath69    notice that the goldstone theorem generically is not applicable in this model@xcite .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "in fact , the scale symmetry ( [ st ] ) leads to a conserved dilatation current @xmath70 .",
    "however , for example in the spatially flat frw universe the spatial components of the current @xmath71 behave as @xmath72 as @xmath73 . due to this anomalous behavior at infinity",
    ", there is a flux of the current leaking to infinity , which causes the non conservation of the dilatation charge .",
    "the absence of the latter implies that one of the conditions necessary for the goldstone theorem is missing .",
    "the non conservation of the dilatation charge is similar to the well known effect of instantons in qcd where singular behavior in the spatial infinity leads to the absence of the goldstone boson associated to the @xmath74 symmetry .",
    "after the change of variables to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) and some simple algebra , eq.([app4 ] ) takes the standard gr form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the einstein tensor in the riemannian space - time with the metric @xmath68 ; the energy - momentum tensor @xmath77 is now @xmath78 where the function @xmath79 is defined as following : @xmath80 -v_{2}}{(\\zeta + b_{g})^{2}}. \\label{veff1}\\ ] ] putting @xmath43 in the arguments of @xmath81 we indicate explicitly that @xmath81 incorporates our choice for the integration constant @xmath43 that appears as a result of the spontaneous breakdown of the scale symmetry .",
    "we will see in the next sections that @xmath49-dependence of @xmath82 in the form of _ square _ of @xmath83 has a key role in the resolution of the old cc problem in tmt .",
    "the fact that only such @xmath49-dependence emerges in @xmath82 , and a @xmath49-dependence is absent for example in the numerator of @xmath82 , is a direct result of our basic assumption that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are independent of the measure fields ( see item 2 in sec.ii ) .",

    "the obtained model belongs to a more general class of models than those discussed recently in ref.@xcite .",

    "in fact , using the notations of the general form of the tmt action ( [ s ] ) in the case of the action ( [ totaction ] ) , one can conclude that the relation between the `` usual '' ( i.e. entering in the action with the usual measure @xmath4 ) lagrangian density @xmath85 and the new one @xmath84 ( entering in the action with the new measure @xmath22 ) is roughly speaking @xmath412 . in the case @xmath413 becomes negligible , the remaining term of the action @xmath414 would describe gr instead of tmt .",
    "it seems to be very interesting that such _ a correspondence principle for the tmt action ( [ s ] ) may have a certain relation to the extreme smallness of the cosmological constant_.    appearance of a large dimensionless constant in particle field theory",
    "is usually associated with hierarchy of masses and/or interactions describing by _ different _ terms in the lagrangian .",
    "the way large numbers can appear in the tmt action is absolutely different .",
    "it is easier to see this difference in the case of a fine tuned model , where @xmath59 and @xmath415 , see appendix b. in such a case the lagrangians @xmath84 and @xmath85 not only have the same type of terms but they are just proportional : @xmath416",
    ". therefore _ the nature of the huge value of @xmath57 differs here very much from the conventional hierarchy issue_.",
    "if such the ratio between @xmath84 and @xmath85 is actually realized , then taking into account the fact that @xmath84 and @xmath85 describe the same matter and gravity degrees of freedom in a very similar manner , the question arises why @xmath84 is not dynamically negligible in comparison with @xmath85 . to answer this question we have to turn to the fundamental action ( [ totaction ] ) that it is convenient to rewrite in the following form @xmath417   \\label{totaction1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one can see that the ratio @xmath418 has an important dynamical role . analyzing the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) and cosmological dynamics studied in secs.iv-vi it is easy to see that the order of magnitude of the scalar field @xmath419 is generically close to that of @xmath57 (",
    "recall that @xmath420 ) .",
    "in other words , it turns out that _ on the mass shell the ratio of the measures _ @xmath421 _ generically compensates the smallness of _ @xmath422 .",
    "thus , similar terms ( @xmath423-terms , kinetic terms and pre - potential terms ) appearing in the action ( [ totaction ] ) with measures @xmath22 and @xmath4 respectively , are both dynamically important in general .    in the light of this understanding of the general picture",
    "it is interesting to check the tmt dynamics in situations where @xmath418 becomes very small .",
    "let us start from the fine tuned model where @xmath424 and @xmath59 ( recall that @xmath278 and we consider the case @xmath187 ) . in this case",
    "it follows from the constraint ( [ zeta - without - ferm - delta=0 ] ) that @xmath425 then the effective potential ( [ veffvac - delta=0 ] ) ( see also eqs.([rho - without - ferm])-([v - quint - without - ferm - delta=0 ] ) ) reads @xmath426 in such a fine tuned model , @xmath418 approaches zero asymptotically as @xmath195 where the effective potential becomes flat .",
    "however when looking into the tmt action written in the form ( [ totaction1 ] ) we see that the asymptotic disappearance of @xmath418 means that we deal with an asymptotic transition from tmt to a conventional field theory model with only measure of integration @xmath4 and only one lagrangian density . in the limit",
    "@xmath427 , the transformation to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) takes the form @xmath428 .",

    "similar conclusion is obtained in a model where @xmath432 , i.e. with no fine tuning of the prepotentials , which have been studied in sec.ivd .",
    "the only difference is that now @xmath427 and @xmath433 as @xmath434 , see eq.([minveff ] ) ; in a small neighborhood of @xmath435 the tmt action presented in the einstein frame looks like ( [ totaction - zeta0 ] ) .",
    "note however that in the context of the k - essence model studied in sec.vii where @xmath120 and @xmath432 , the asymptotic value of @xmath49 in the late time universe ( as @xmath195 and @xmath436 which is an asymptotic regime of the phantom behavior ) is @xmath437 but nevertheless the energy density tends to @xmath438 as well ( see figs.1b and 19b ) .",
    "similar situation takes place in the model where @xmath439 , studied in secs.ivc and vi .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath49 in the late time universe is again @xmath440 and the energy density tends to @xmath441 as well ( see figs.1a , 5b and 15b ) .",
    "thus in all the models , the huge value of @xmath57 can ensure the needed smallness of the dark energy density in the late time universe but it is not always realized due to the limit @xmath427 .",
    "as we have seen in sec.ivb , in the model with @xmath129 and @xmath130 , the old cosmological constant problem is resolved without fine tuning : the effective potential ( [ veffvac - delta=0 ] ) is proportional to the square of @xmath442 , and @xmath145 where @xmath443 , is the minimum of the effective potential without any further tuning of the parameters and initial conditions .",
    "now we want to analyze some of the essential differences we have in tmt as compared with the conditions of the weinberg s no - go theorem and show what are the reasons providing solution of the old cc problem in tmt .",
    "this has to be done when tmt is considered in the original frame since in the einstein frame we observe only the results in the effective picture after some of the symmetries are broken .    * the basic assumption of the weinberg s theorem is that in the vacuum all the fields ( metric tensor @xmath23 and matter fields @xmath444 ) are constant .",
    "as it was pointed out by s.weinberg in the review@xcite , the euler - lagrange equations for such constant fields ( with the action @xmath445 ) have the form @xmath446 @xmath447 and these equations constitute the basis for further weinberg s arguments .",
    "in particular , if @xmath448 symmetry @xmath449 survives as a vestige of general covariance when all the fields are constrained to be constant , the lagrangian @xmath450 transforms as a density : @xmath451 weinberg concludes that when eq.([w1 ] ) is satisfied then the unique form of @xmath450 is @xmath452 where @xmath453 is independent of @xmath23 . as a matter of fact this means that for example in the case of a scalar matter field @xmath0 model considered by weinberg in sec.vi of the review @xcite , @xmath453 is determined by the value of the scalar field @xmath0 potential as @xmath0 is a constant determined by eq.([w2 ] ) .",
    "+ however , if for example one of the fields @xmath444 appears in @xmath450 only via a term linear in space - time derivatives of this field then eq.([w2 ] ) turns out to be an identity , but instead the euler - lagrange equations take another form .",
    "this is what happens in tmt where the first term in the action ( [ s ] ) is linear in space - time derivatives of @xmath27 ( when using the definition ( [ aabg]))(see also ) .",
    "then instead of eq.([w2 ] ) which appears to be an identity in this case , the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath27 look @xmath454 which are nontrivial even for constant @xmath27 , and resulting in eq.([adl1 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath455 is a scalar density and transforms exactly according to eq.([w4 ] ) .",
    "therefore generically ( i.e. if @xmath27 are not constant while other fields are constant ) , the lagrangian @xmath456 satisfying ( [ w4 ] ) can have the following form @xmath457 where @xmath458 and @xmath459 are independent of @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "this is why the equation @xmath460 where @xmath461 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , used by weinberg@xcite for all constant @xmath23 and matter fields , is generically no longer valid .",

    "* from the point of view of tmt , this is the answer to the question why the old cosmological constant problem can not be solved ( without fine tuning ) in theories with only the measure of integration * @xmath4 * in the action*. * recall that one of the basic assumptions of the weinberg s no - go theorem is that all fields in the vacuum must be constant .",

    ". one of the reasons is that in the framework of the postulated need to use the palatini formalism , the original metric @xmath23 and connection @xmath471 appearing in the fundamental tmt action describe a non - riemannian space - time .",
    "the transformation to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) enables to see the physical meaning of tmt because the space - time becomes riemannian in the einstein frame .",
    "now we see that the transformation to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) plays also the role of a * regularization of the space - time metric * : the singular behavior of the transformation ( [ ct ] ) as @xmath472 compensates the disappearance of the original metric @xmath23 in the vacuum @xmath145 . as a result of this the metric in the einstein frame @xmath68 turns out to be well defined in all physical states including the @xmath216 vacuum state .",
    "the main idea of tmt is that the general form of the action @xmath473 is not enough in order to account for some of the fundamental problems of particle physics and cosmology .",

    "we would like to emphasize that including in the action of tmt the coupling of the lagrangian density @xmath31 with the measure @xmath22 , we modify in general both the gravitational and matter sectors as compared with the standard field theory in curved space - time . besides we made two more assumptions :",

    "in particular there is no need for the non - linear kinetic term as well as for the phantom type term in the fundamental lagrangian densities @xmath31 and @xmath21 in order to obtain a super - acceleration phase at the late time universe .    after making use of the variational principle and formulating the resulting equations in the einstein frame ,",
    "we have seen that the effective action ( [ k - eff ] ) represents a concrete realization of the @xmath3-essence@xcite obtained from first principles of tmt without any exotic terms in the fundamental lagrangian densities .        as @xmath119 , i.e. in the fine - tuned model ,",

    "it is clear that this type of `` sudden '' singularity studied by barrow@xcite on purely kinematic grounds has no relation to the initial singularity theorems@xcite .",
    "note also that the strong energy condition holds on the line @xmath475 .",
    "it is worthwhile to pay attention to the fact that the sound speed @xmath254 tends to infinity as the starting point @xmath182 approaches the line @xmath475 .",

    "it is interesting that the resolution of the old cc problem in the context of tmt happens in the regime where @xmath481 . from the point of view of tmt ,",
    "the latter is the answer to the question why the old cosmological constant problem can not be solved ( without fine tuning ) in theories with only the measure of integration @xmath4 in the action .",
    "\\2 ) _ the new cosmological constant problem_. interesting result following from the general structure of the scale invariant tmt model with @xmath187 is that the cosmological constant @xmath189 , eq.([lambda ] ) , is a ratio of quantities constructed from pre - potentials @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath103 .",
    "such structure of @xmath189 allows to propose two ways ( see sec.viiia ) for the resolution of the problem of the smallness of @xmath189 that should be @xmath395 :    \\a ) the first way is a kind of a _ seesaw _ mechanism@xcite .",
    "for instance , if @xmath398 and @xmath399 then @xmath406 .",
    "\\b ) the second way is realized if the dimensionless parameters @xmath103 , @xmath482 and @xmath483 of the action ( [ totaction ] ) are huge numbers of the close orders of magnitude . for example , if @xmath405 then for getting @xmath395 one should assume that @xmath484 .",
    "the latter means that the ratio of the lagrangian density @xmath84 coming into the underlying action with the new measure @xmath22 , to the lagrangian density @xmath85 coming with the usual measure @xmath4 , is extremely small : @xmath485 .",
    "possibility of this idea means that the resolution of the new cosmological constant problem may have a certain relation to _ the correspondence principle _ between tmt and conventional field theories ( see details in sec.viii.a.2 ) .",
    "if no fine tuning of the parameters is made in the fundamental action , namely if @xmath486 , then our tmt model has big enough regions in the parameter space where the super - acceleration phase in the late time universe becomes possible .",
    "the appropriate phantom dark energy asymptotically approaches a cosmological constant .",
    "however , in the framework of our model it is impossible to obtain _ a pure classical solution _ which connects the early universe power law inflation with the late time super - acceleration .",
    "this problem is apparently related with the toy character of our tmt model .",
    "first , possible dependence of @xmath116 and @xmath117 on the higgs field has not been taken into account .",
    "second , the role of the matter creation has been ignored : in tmt the fermionic matter generically contributes to the constraint equation for the scalar field @xmath49 and so can effect the field @xmath0 dynamics as well .",
    "one can speculate that matter creation at the end of inflation may cause a phase transition from the structure of the phase plane of the type shown in figs.9 and 10 to the structure as in fig.17 . then without any fine tuning , a scenario involving a start from finite curvature , a power law inflation in the early universe and super - accelerated late universe with small asymptotic cc would be possible .      in this paper",
    "we have studied only classical tmt and its possible effects in the context of cosmology .",
    "however quantization of tmt as well as influence of quantum effects on the processes explored in this paper may have a crucial role .",
    "we summarize here some ideas and speculations which gives us a hope that quantum effects can keep the main results of this paper .",
    "recall first two fundamental facts of tmt as a classical field theory : ( a ) the measure degrees of freedom appear in the equations of motion only via the scalar @xmath49 , eq.([zeta ] ) ; ( b ) the scalar @xmath49 is determined ( as a function of matter fields , in our toy model - as a function of @xmath0 ) by the constraint which is nothing but a consistency condition of the equations of motion ( see eqs.([app1])-([app3 ] ) in appendix a and eq.([constraint2 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore the constraint plays a key role in tmt .",
    "note however that if we were ignore the gravity from the very beginning in the action ( [ totaction ] ) then instead of the constraint ( [ app3 ] ) we would obtain eq.([app1 ] ) ( where one has to put zero the scalar curvature ) .",
    "in such a case we would deal with a different theory .",
    "this notion shows that the gravity and matter intertwined in tmt in a much more complicated manner than in gr . hence introducing the new measure of integration @xmath22 we have to expect that the quantization of tmt may be a complicated enough problem .",
    "nevertheless we would like here to point out that in the light of the recently proposed idea of ref.@xcite , the incorporation of four scalar fields @xmath52 together with the scalar density @xmath22 , eq.([phi ] ) , ( which in our case are the measure fields and the new measure of integration respectively ) , is a possible way to define local observables in the local quantum field theory approach to quantum gravity .",
    "we regard this result as an indication that the effective gravity @xmath17 matter field theory has to contain the new measure of integration @xmath22 as it is in tmt .",
    "the assumption that the measure fields @xmath52 ( or @xmath27 ) appear in the action ( [ s ] ) _ only _ via the measure of integration @xmath22 , has a key role in the tmt results and in particular for the resolution of the old cosmological constant problem . in principle",
    "one can think of breakdown of such a structure by quantum corrections .",
    "however , tmt possesses an infinite dimensional symmetry mentioned in item 2 of sec.ii which , as we hope , is able to protect this feature of the structure of the action from a deformation caused by quantum corrections .",
    "another effect of quantum corrections is the possible appearance of a nonminimal coupling of the scalar field @xmath0 to gravity in the form like for example @xmath487 .",
    "proceeding in the first order formalism of tmt one can show that the nonminimal coupling can affect the k - essence dynamics but the mechanism for resolution of the old cc problem exhibited in this paper remains unchanged .",
    "this conclusion together with expected effect of quantum corrections on the scale invariance , including appearance of a `` normal '' cosmological constant term @xmath488 ( see our discussion in the paragraph after eq.([veff=0 ] ) ) , allows us to hope that the quantization of the underlying tmt model ( [ totaction ] ) will not spoil the exhibited resolution of the old cc problem .",
    "quantization of tmt being a constrained system requires developing the hamiltonian formulation of tmt .",
    "preliminary consideration shows that the einstein frame appears in the canonical formalism in a very natural manner .",
    "a systematic exploration of tmt in the canonical formalism will be a subject of forthcoming research .",
    "possibility of the classical evolution of the universe to start from finite values of @xmath489 , @xmath490 such that @xmath491 and @xmath492 are finite and @xmath493 , requires certain arguments addressed to explain how such an initial state could be formed .",
    "one can think of the action ( [ totaction ] ) of the underlying model as a tree approximation of the entire tmt effective action at energies below the planck scale .",
    "then one can expect that the next terms in the expansion of the entire effective action will be like @xmath494 , @xmath495 etc .",
    "coupled both to the measure @xmath4 and to the measure @xmath22 .",
    "it is evident that in such more general tmt model formulated in the einstein frame , the @xmath2 dependence of the matter lagrangian density @xmath107 in eq.([k - eff ] ) may be very much different from that in eq.([p1 ] ) . as a result of this the structure of the phase plane may change quantitatively in comparison with that of the model studied in the present paper .",
    "for example , it may be found that the new factor @xmath496 has no zeros . in such a case",
    "the effect of the initial singularity related to the line @xmath220 vanishes .",
    "however this is only one of the possibilities . in the absence of a reliable knowledge about the entire effective action one can also expect , with not less grounds , that the changed structure of the phase plane still involves the line @xmath220 .",
    "so we return the problem formulated in the previous paragraph . at the qualitative level we can suggest the following two ideas .",
    "\\1 . as we have already mentioned after eq.([rho - very - big ] ) the described initial state can be realized at the energy density close to the planck scale . in this case ,",
    "similar to the cosmological models in the framework of the standard einstein gravity , there is a need to use the quantum gravity and therefore the singularity effects related to the line @xmath220 are expected to be smoothed out .",
    "\\2 . if @xmath497 , then quantum effects from the scalar field dynamics itself can play a crucial role in smoothing the singularity related to the line @xmath220 . recall that @xmath263 in the regions between @xmath220 and @xmath251 ( where @xmath242 , see figs.9 and 10 ) , which means that from this side of the line @xmath220 arbitrarily small scalar field fluctuation is amplified exponentially . besides @xmath498 when approaching the line @xmath220 from this side .",
    "therefore we expect that the classical or quantum chaos in the regions with @xmath242 should affect the classical dynamics on the other side of the border , i.e. in the close neighborhood of the line @xmath220 in zone i. moreover , this influence can work as a mechanism responsible for creation of our universe starting from an excitation in zone with @xmath242 .",

    "however it is very unlikely that a nondynamical scalar field will not acquire a kinetic term after quantum corrections@xcite .",
    "then it becomes dynamical which restores the above results for the model ( [ toy-2 ] ) .",
    "this is why we have ignored the rather formal possibility of introducing the nondynamical scalars into the fundamental action of the models studied in this paper .",
    "with the choice of the parameters @xmath114 , the scalar field @xmath0 lagrangian density ( [ p1 ] ) takes the form @xmath552 where @xmath553 @xmath554 .",
    "\\label{g(y)}\\ ] ] such a model is a particular realization of the models studied in ref.@xcite , but recall that here it follows from first principles .",
    "it is very important that the factor @xmath555 in front of @xmath476 in the @xmath0-equation ( [ phi1 ] ) is now @xmath556 and the line @xmath220 in the plane @xmath174 provides the same mechanism for the dynamical avoidance of the initial singularity we have studied in detail in secs.v and vi . in the models considered in those sections , the role of nonzero @xmath116 and @xmath117 becomes negligible as @xmath557 .",
    "therefore the only essential difference of the model with @xmath114 from the models of secs.v and vi is that the power law inflation ends with a graceful exit to a quintessence phase ( with zero cc in contrast with the model of sec.vi ) .",
