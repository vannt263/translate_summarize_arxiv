    "quantum graphs have been intensively studied mainly in the last thirty years .",
    "there is extensive bibliography we refer to , e.g. the book @xcite , the proceedings @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of the models studied are quantum graphs with attached semiinfinite leads . for this model ,",
    "the notion of resonances can be defined ; there are two main definitions : resolvent resonances ( singularities of the resolvent ) and scattering resonances ( singularities of the scattering matrix ) . for the study of resonances in quantum graphs",
    "we refer e.g. to @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding resonance asymptotics in quantum graphs has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "a surprising observation by davies and pushnitski @xcite shows that a graph has in some cases fewer resonances than one would expect from weyl asymptotics .",
    "criteria , which can distinguish these non - weyl graphs from the graphs with regular weyl asymptotics , have been presented in @xcite ( graphs with standard coupling ) , and in del ( graphs with general coupling ) . although distinguishing between these two cases is quite easy ( it depends on the vertex properties of the graph ) , finding the leading term of asymptotics , which is closely related to the `` effective size '' of the graph , is more difficult since it uses the structure of the whole graph .    in the paper",
    "we express the first term of non - weyl asymptotics using the method of pseudo orbits and find bounds on the effective size that depend on the structure of the graph .",
    "the paper is divided into the following eight sections : in the second section we introduce the model itself , in the third section we state known theorems on the asymptotics of the resonances , in the fourth section we develop the method of pseudo orbit expansion for the resonance condition , in the fifth section we state how the effective size can be found for an equilateral graph ( a graph with the same lengths of the internal edges ) , in the sixth section we develop a method that allows us to delete some of the edges of a non - weyl graph , in the seventh section we state the main theorems on the bounds on the effective size and position of the resonances for equilateral graphs , and finally the eighth section illustrates found results and developed method in three examples .",
    "first , we describe the main notions . we consider a metric graph @xmath0 that consists of the set of vertices @xmath1 , the set of @xmath2 finite internal edges @xmath3 of lengths @xmath4 ( these edges can be parametrized by intervals @xmath5 ) , and the set of @xmath6 semiinfinite external edges @xmath7 ( parametrized by intervals @xmath8 ) . the graph is equipped by the second order differential operator @xmath9 that acts as @xmath10 on internal and external edges .",
    "the domain of this operator consists of functions with edge components in sobolev space @xmath11 and at the same time satisfying the coupling conditions at the vertices @xmath12where @xmath13 is a @xmath14 unitary matrix ( @xmath15 is the degree of the vertex ) , @xmath16 is a @xmath14 identity matrix , @xmath17 is the vector of limits of functional values to the vertex from attached edges and , similarly , @xmath18 is the vector of limits of outgoing derivatives .",
    "this general form of the coupling was independently introduced by kostrykin and schrader @xcite and harmer @xcite .",
    "there is a trick shown in @xcite how to describe the coupling on the whole graph by one big @xmath19 unitary matrix @xmath20 that is similar to a block diagonal matrix with blocks @xmath13 .",
    "( square matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are similar if there exists a regular square matrix  @xmath23 such that @xmath24 . )",
    "this matrix encodes not only the coupling but also the topology of the graph .",
    "@xmath25 in the previous equation @xmath16 is @xmath19 identity matrix , and the vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 consist of entries @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this coupling condition corresponds to a graph where all the vertices are joined into one vertex .",
    "one can describe the effective coupling on the compact part of the graph using energy - dependent @xmath28 coupling matrix @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the square root of energy .",
    "there is a straightforward way @xcite how to construct this effective coupling matrix by a standard method by schur , etc .",
    "@xmath31^{-1}u_{3}\\ , , \\label{eq - utilde}\\]]where the matrices @xmath32 are blocks of the matrix @xmath33 ; @xmath34 corresponds to coupling between internal edges , @xmath35 corresponds to coupling between external edges , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to the mixed coupling .",
    "the coupling condition has a similar form to ( [ eq - coupling2 ] ) with @xmath20 replaced by @xmath29 and @xmath16 meaning now @xmath28 identity matrix .",
    "we are interested in asymptotical behavior of the number of resolvent resonances of the system .",
    "the _ resolvent resonance _ is usually defined as the pole of the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent @xmath38 into the second sheet .",
    "the resolvent resonances can be obtained by the method of complex scaling ( more on that in @xcite ) .",
    "we use a simpler but equivalent definition .",
    "we call @xmath39 a resolvent resonance if there exists a generalized eigenfunction @xmath40 , @xmath41 satisfying @xmath42 on all edges of the graph and fulfilling the coupling conditions ( [ eq - coupling1 ] ) that on all external edges behaves as @xmath43 .    this definition is equivalent to the previously mentioned one because these generalized eigenfunctions ( which , of course , are not square integrable ) , become after complex scaling square integrable .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that the set of resolvent resonances is equal to the union of the set of scattering resonances , and the eigenvalues with the eigenfunctions supported only on the internal part of the graph .",
    "we define the counting function @xmath44 that counts the number of all resolvent resonances including their multiplicities contained in the circle of radius @xmath45 in the @xmath46-plane .",
    "one should note that by this method we count twice more resonances than in the energy plane .",
    "this is clear for the case of a compact graph because @xmath46 and @xmath47 correspond to the same eigenvalue .",
    "asymptotics of the resonances in most of the quantum graphs obeys weyl s law  ",
    "equation  ( [ eq - weyl ] ) with @xmath48 equal to the sum of the lengths of the internal edges , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "however , there exist such quantum graphs for which the leading term of the asymptotics is smaller than expected ; we call these graphs _ non - weyl_. the problem was studied for graphs with standard coupling ( in literature also called kirchhoff , free or neumann coupling ) in @xcite , and for graphs with general coupling in @xcite .",
    "we define the standard coupling and state main results presented in these papers .    for the standard coupling functional values",
    "are continuous at each vertex and the sum of outgoing derivatives is equal to zero , i.e. for the vertex @xmath50 with degree @xmath51 we have @xmath52    ( davies and pushnitski)let us assume a graph @xmath0 with standard coupling at all vertices and the sum of the lengths of all internal edges equal to @xmath49",
    ". then the number of resolvent resonances has the following asymptotics @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",

    "while it is quite easy to find whether a graph is weyl or non - weyl ( it depends only on the vertex properties of the graph ) , determining the coefficient @xmath48 ( the effective size of the graph ) is more complicated , because it depends on the properties of the whole graph .",
    "it is illustrated e.g. in theorem 7.3 in @xcite .",
    "there is a theory developed showing how to find the spectrum of a compact quantum graph by the pseudo orbit expansion ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this section",

    "the only difference is that the vertex - scattering matrix @xmath100 introduced in @xcite is replaced by the effective vertex - scattering matrix @xmath101 .",
