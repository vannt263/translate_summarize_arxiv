    "ultracold neutral atoms are a wonderful tool to study many - body physics and strong correlation effects . since the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in alkali atoms @xcite , we have been witnesses of two major breakthroughs .",
    "one is the cooling of fermionic atoms and the study of cooper pairing and the bcs to bec transition @xcite .",
    "the other one is the implementation of lattice hamiltonians using bosonic @xcite and fermionic atoms in off - resonance optical lattices .",
    "contemporary and supported by these experimental achievements , a plethora of theoretical papers has consolidated ultracold atoms as an ideal system for quantum simulations .",
    "the goal is two - fold : amo is now capable of implementing known hamiltonians which could describe real systems in condensed matter physics , such as hubbard models @xcite and spin hamiltonians @xcite ; but it is also possible to study new physical effects , such as the quantum hall effect with bosons @xcite and lattice gauge theories @xcite .    in this work",
    "we deepen and expand the ideas presented in @xcite , where we introduced a novel mechanism for pairing based on transport  inducing collisions . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : collisions ] , when atoms collide they can mutate their internal state .",
    "if the atoms are placed in a state - dependent optical lattice , whenever such a collision happens the pair of atoms must tunnel to a different site associated to their new state .",
    "for deep enough lattices , as in the mott insulator experiments @xcite , this coordinated jump of pairs of particles can be the dominant process and the ensemble may become a superfluid of pairs .",
    "the focus of this work is to develop these ideas for all possible interaction asymmetries that can happen in experiments with bosonic atoms in two internal states , where the scattering lengths among different states can be different , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we want to understand the different types of correlated hopping that appear when we move beyond the limited type of interactions considered in ref .",
    ". we will better study the resulting phases and phase transitions , using different analytical and numerical tools that describe the many body states , and evolving from few particles to more realistic simulations .",
    "the main results will be to show that when one considers more general asymmetries , a new type of correlated hopping appears , but that both the previous @xcite and the newly found two  body terms cooperate in creating a superfluid state with pair correlations .",
    "indeed , this new state will also be shown to be more than just a condensate of pairs , based on analytical and numerical studies .",
    "correlated hopping is not a new idea .",
    "it appears naturally in fermionic tight - binding models , where it has been used to describe mixed valence solids @xcite and , given that they are able to mimic the attractive interactions between electrons , also high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite . in most of these works ,",
    "the correlated hopping appears in the form @xmath2 indicating that the environment can influence the motion of a particle .",
    "this would seem substantially different from correlated motion of pairs of fermions .",
    "nevertheless , even this more elaborate form of correlated hopping has been shown to lead to the formation of bound electron pairs @xcite and it has been put forward as a possible explanation for high @xmath3 superconductivity @xcite .    this work is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we introduce the most general model of correlated hopping that can be produced by such means with two  states bosons .",

    "the first and second terms , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are related to on - site and next - neighbor interactions .",
    "when these terms are dominant , we expect the atoms in the lattice form an insulator . such a phase is characterized by atoms being completely localized to lattice sites , having well - defined occupation numbers , the absence of macroscopic coherence and a gapped energy spectrum . whether this insulating state is itself dominated by strong on  site interactions @xmath19 or by nearest ",
    "neighbor repulsion / attraction @xmath21 will decide whether it presents an uniform density , a mott insulator ( mi ) , or a periodic density pattern , a charge density wave ( cdw ) , respectively .",
    "the third term is the key feature of our model .",
    "it describes the tunneling of pairs between neighboring lattice sites , with amplitude @xmath22 given @xmath23 we expect the atoms to travel along the lattice in pairs forming what we call a pair superfluid ( psf ) .",
    "these pairs will be completely delocalized , establishing long range coherence along the lattice .",
    "the observable @xmath24 would be the figure of merit describing this kind of delocalization , while a vanishing @xmath25 indicates the absence of the single - particle correlations appearing in a normal superfluid .",
    "furthermore , we expect this phase to have a critical velocity , similar to that of an atomic condensate , and the energy spectrum should be gapless .    unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite , when one considers the most general kind of atomic interaction , a second kind of correlated hopping appears , described by the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) . here",
    ", individual atoms will hop only if there is already a particle in the site they go to ( @xmath26 ) or leave at least a particle behind ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "one might be induced to think that this term is equivalent to single ",
    "particle hopping with a strength that depends on the average density , thus giving rise to a single - particle superfluid ( sf ) phase .",
    "however , this does not seem to be the case .",
    "we will show that the correlated hopping @xmath28 generates a mixed phase which contains features of both the ordinary bec and the psf created by @xmath22      we now establish the relation between the model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) and the dynamics of atoms in an optical superlattice . the actual setup we have in mind",

    "it consists on a three  dimensional lattice that is strongly confining along the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions , creating isolated tubes . on top of this , we create an optical superlattice acting along the @xmath31 direction @xcite .",
    "this superlattice traps atoms in the dressed states @xmath8 and @xmath32 while the atomic interaction is diagonal in the basis of bare states @xmath33 and @xmath34 the interaction will be described by a contact potential and parameterized by some real constants @xmath35 @xmath36 these interaction constants are functions of the s  wave one  dimensional scattering lengths between different species @xmath37 in general , the interaction strengths among different atomic components are different from each other , a situation that can be enhanced with feshbach resonances . we will use a parameterization @xmath38 that makes the symmetries more explicit @xmath39 the total hamiltonian combines the previous interaction with the kinetic energy and the trapping potential for one particle @xmath40\\psi_s(x ) dx,\\ ] ] which is written in a different basis @xmath41 since the superlattice potential @xmath42 is the dominant term , we may approximate the bosonic fields as linear combinations of the wannier modes in this superlattice and in the dressed state basis , a process detailed in [ sec : derivation ] . note that out of all the terms in the interaction hamiltonian ( [ eq : interaction2 ] ) , only the first one is insensitive to the state of the atoms .",
    "this is important because the asymmetries @xmath43 and @xmath44 when expressed in the dressed basis , produce terms that change the state of the atoms during a collision .",
    "once we introduce the effective interaction constants in the lattice @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the single site wannier wavefunction , we arrive to the effective hamiltonian in eq .",

    "in this section we study the eigenstates of hamiltonian ( [ eq : model ] ) for systems that we can diagonalize exactly .",
    "the goals are to characterize the effect of the different interaction and hopping terms , as well as to understand the structure of the ground state wavefunction .",
    "although we are limited to a small number of particles , the following examples provide enough evidence of the roles of correlated hopping , nearest neighbor repulsion and the utility of different correlators to characterize the states .",

    "this is consistent with later studies where we will see that on - site interactions just add a global , density dependent contribution to the energy . to better understand the role of the remaining terms",

    "the first interesting feature is that , as predicted by perturbation theory , we have large lobes both with integer @xmath217 and with fractional @xmath218 occupation numbers , forming uniform mott insulators and cdw , respectively .",
    "the insulators are characterized by having a well defined number of particles per site , and thus no number fluctuations @xmath219 while the size of the lobes does not depend dramatically on the sign of @xmath20 these are significantly larger for the pair hopping @xmath10 than for the correlated hopping @xmath144 as already seen with perturbation theory .    the boundary of the insulating areas marks a second order phase transition to a superfluid regime , where we find number fluctuations @xmath220 in order to characterize these gapless phases we have computed the order parameter of a single - particle condensate @xmath221 and two quantities that we use to detect pairing .",
    "the first one is a two - particle correlation that generalizes the order parameter of a bec to the case of a pair - bec @xmath222 the second quantity @xmath223 is used to correct the previous value eliminating the contribution that may come from a single - particle condensate coexisting with the pair - bec .    when @xmath93 we always find that @xmath224 even outside the insulating lobes .",
    "this marks the absence of a single - particle bec , which is expected since we do not have single - particle hopping . on the other hand",
    ", we now find long range coherence of the pairs and thus @xmath225 all over the non - insulating area , which we identify with the pair - superfluid regime .",
    "the situation is slightly different for @xmath226 the single - particle order parameter @xmath25 no longer vanishes in the superfluid area , denoting the existence of single - particle coherence , but at the same time we find that the two - particle correlations exceed the contribution from the single - particle superfluid as @xmath227 which we attribute to a coexistence of both a single - particle and a pair - superfluid , or a state with both features .",
    "this picture does not change substantially when @xmath21 is positive or negative .",

    "the previous numerical simulations are very simple and can not fully capture the single particle and two - particle correlators . to complete and verify the full picture we have searched the ground states of the full hamiltonian using the so called itebd algorithm , which uses an infinite matrix product state ansatz together with imaginary time evolution @xcite .",

    "this variational ansatz is known to work well for states with fast decaying correlations , but it also gives a good qualitative description of the critical phases .    in order to optimize the itebd wavefunction we performed an approximate imaginary time evolution using a trotter decomposition and local updates of the associated tensors , as described in ref .",

    "the pair correlations between neighboring sites decrease very quickly , while in the superfluid regime we see a critical behavior @xmath246 with an exponent that varies between @xmath247 and @xmath248 depending on the simulation parameters .     vs. site separation , for @xmath249 @xmath250 @xmath251 @xmath252 @xmath253 @xmath254 , from top to bottom .",

    "the remaining lines have been rescaled and plotted in log - log scale in the inset , which shows that the two - particle correlator decays approximately as @xmath256 with a power @xmath257",
    "there are many ways of differentiating the phases we have found , each one having its own degree of difficulty .",
    "the simplest and best established detection methods are related to the insulating regimes .",
    "these phases , which involve both mi and cdw , are characterized by having a well defined number of particles at each lattice site , the lack of coherence and an energy gap that separates the insulator from other excitations .",
    "the energy gap in these insulators may be probed either by static or spectroscopic means as it has been done in experiments @xcite , determining that indeed the system is insulating .",
    "second , the lack of coherence will translate into featureless time - of - flight images , having no interference fringes @xcite at all .",
    "even though there will be no fringes , the measured density will be affected by quantum noise .",
    "the analysis of the noise correlation will show peaks at certain momenta @xcite that depend on the periodicity of the state , so that the number of peaks in the cdw phase will be twice those of the mi . in case of having access to the lattice sites , as in the experiments with electron microscopy @xcite , or in future experiments with large aperture microscopic objectives that can collect the fluorescence of individual lattice sites @xcite",
    ", the discrimination between the mi and the cdw should be even easier , since in one case we have a uniform density and in the other a periodic distribution of atoms .",
    "when the system enters a superfluid phase , it becomes a perfect `` conductor '' with a gapless excitation spectrum .",
    "the lack of an energy gap , should be evident in the spectroscopic experiments suggested before .",
    "however , we are not only interested in the superfluid nature , but rather in the fact that this quantum phase is strongly paired .",
    "more precisely , we have found that for @xmath93 the single - particle coherence is small or zero , and that the two - particle correlator decays slowly @xmath258 the first equation implies that the time of flight images will reveal no interference fringes and will exhibit noise correlations which will be similar to the mi . in order to probe @xmath259 and confirm the pairing of the particles , we suggest to use raman photo - association to build molecules out of pairs of atoms @xcite .",
    "for an efficient conversion , it would be best to perform an adiabatic passage from the free atoms to the bound regime . as described in @xcite",
    ", we expect a mapping that goes from @xmath260 where @xmath130 is the number of bosons and @xmath131 the number of molecules .",
    "more precisely , we expect the @xmath261 operator to be mapped into @xmath262 so that the pair coherence of the original atoms translates into the equivalent of @xmath263 for the molecules .",
    "this order should reveal as an interference pattern in time - of - flight images of the molecules .",
    "finally , in cases with @xmath57 we have found the coexistence of single - particle and two - particle coherences .",
    "this translates also into the coexistence of interference fringes with nonzero pair correlators .",
    "summing up , we have suggested a family of experiments with cold atoms that would produce correlated hopping of bosons .",
    "the mechanism for the correlated hopping is an asymmetry in the contact interaction between atoms .",
    "this asymmetry is exploited by trapping the atoms in dressed states , a configuration that gives rise to transport induced by collisions .",
    "the main result of this paper is that there is a huge variety of interaction asymmetries that will give rise to long range pair correlations via interaction  induced transport .",
    "formally , in the resulting effective models we recognize two dynamical behaviors .",
    "if we have a nonzero asymmetry in the interspecies interactions , @xmath264 the hamiltonian will exhibit pair hopping , while an asymmetry in the intra - species scattering lengths @xmath265 gives rise to correlated hopping . however , we have given enough evidence that * both * hamiltonian terms give rise to a novel quantum phase which we call pair superfluid .",
    "this phase is characterized by a gapless spectrum with a finite sound speed , zero single - particle correlations and long range pair coherence .",
    "all quantum phases are connected by second order quantum phase transitions .",
    "these phases can be produced and identified using variations of current experiments @xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative nature of the effect should help in that respect .",
    "our ideas are not restricted to one dimension .",
    "it is possible to engineer also a two ",
    "body hopping using two  dimensional lattice potentials .",
    "again , the basic ingredients would be atoms with an asymmetric interaction and an optical lattice that traps two states , @xmath8 and @xmath9 with a relative displacement .",
    "both in the one and two  dimensional cases it is a valid question to ask whether the coupling between different trapped states , @xmath266 can excite also transitions to higher bands , processes that have not been considered in the paper .",
    "our answer here is no .",
    "there are only two sources of coupling to higher energy bands .",
    "one is the interaction , but we are already assuming that the interaction energies are much smaller than the band separation . following the notation from ref .",
    "@xcite , we have the constraint that the interaction energy should be smaller than the energy separation to the first excited state in a well of the periodic potential , @xmath267 the same requisite as for ordinary bose  hubbard models @xcite",
    ". the other source of coupling to higher bands would be single  particle hopping .",
    "however , unlike @xcite , here we are assuming that these terms are strongly suppressed compared with the interaction . in other words , realizing the models that we suggest in this paper , for realistic densities",
    ", @xmath268 and simple potentials , imposes no further constraint in current experiments .",
    "finally , let us remark that transport  inducing collisons may be implemented using other kinds of spin - dependent interactions .",
    "for instance , correlated hopping appears naturally in state - dependent lattices loaded with spinor atoms , because their interactions can change the hyperfine state of the atoms while preserving total angular momentum @xcite .",

    "[ fig : superlattice]b @xmath272 under appropriate circumstances , discussed in @xcite , we will find that each superlattice site has a unique ground state , energetically well differentiated from the next excited state , and which consists of a symmetric wavefunction spanning both lattice wells .",
