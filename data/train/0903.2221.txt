    "the josephson effect provides a unique principle to excite high - frequency electromagnetic ( em ) waves @xcite .",
    "much effort has been made to stimulate powerful radiations , first using artificial josephson junction arrays @xcite , and later on josephson junctions inherent in cuprate high-@xmath0 superconductors of layered structures @xcite .",
    "the latter have obvious advantages , since the junctions are homogeneous at the atomic scale guaranteed by the high quality of single crystals , and the superconductivity gap is large , typically of tens of mev , which in principle permits the frequency cover the whole range of the terahertz ( thz ) band , a very useful regime of em waves still lacking of compact solid - state generators @xcite .",
    "an experimental breakthrough was achieved in 2007 @xcite .",
    "clear evidences have been obtained that coherent terahertz radiations from side edges of a thin rectangular mesa were realized by biasing a dc voltage in the @xmath2 axis of the @xmath1 ( bscco ) single crystal ; the frequency of the em wave and the voltage where the radiation occurs obey the ac josephson relation , and the frequency coincides with one of the cavity modes determined by the lateral size of mesa @xcite .",
    "this discovery is expected to leave significant and long - standing impacts .",
    "it has the potential to open a practical way to develop a source of frequency tunable em waves based on superconductivity and fill the so - called thz - gap .",
    "it also shines light on new directions of making use of the phase of superconductivity .",
    "its importance would be better appreciated if one notices that up to now the usage of superconductivity phase variable is still limited to the squid .",
    "the discovery immediately raises many interesting questions , such as why the josephson plasma oscillation , namely the coherent tunneling of cooper pairs forth and back between adjacent cuo layers driven by a @xmath2-axis voltage can radiate strong _ transverse _ radiations , in absence of josephson vortices induced by an applied magnetic field ; how it becomes possible to synchronize the superconductivity phase variables of @xmath5 junctions , and so on .",
    "these quests challenge our knowledge on superconductivity as well as nonlinear phenomena .",
    "it is formulated explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is a significant mismatch in impedance @xmath6 at the edge of a superconductor mesa when the thickness of the mesa @xmath7 is small compared with the em wavelenght @xmath8 , which was known for a single junction as a limiting case @xcite .",
    "this makes the tangential component of oscillating magnetic field at the mesa edge extremely small compared with the electric one , in sharp contrast to the case of em plane waves . actually , this relation is a general property shared by a normal capacitor with small electrode separation . particularly for thin mesas of superconductor ,",
    "the vanishingly small tangential component of magnetic field gives the neumann - type boundary condition of superconductivity phase difference across junctions , namely the spatial derivative of the phase difference normal to the edge should be zero ( in absence of an applied magnetic field ) .    with this neumann boundary condition",
    ", a new dynamic state of superconductivity phase difference has been found in a stack of josephson junctions under a dc voltage bias , which is characterized by static @xmath3 ( actually @xmath9 with @xmath10 integer ) phase kinks localized at the mesa center and piled up alternatively along the @xmath2 axis @xcite . in this @xmath11 kink state",
    ", an inter - lock between superconductivity phases in neighboring junctions appears , which establishes the coherence across the whole system of more than @xmath4 junctions .",
    "the @xmath11 phase kink makes the lateral cavity modes and the transverse josephson plasma couple strongly to each other , permits large dc supercurrent flow into the junctions and generates strong em radiations from the sides of mesa .    the @xmath11 kink state requests strong inductive couplings between adjacent superconducting layers @xcite , which is guaranteed in the cuprates high-@xmath0 superconductor bscco .",
    "another condition is on the thickness of the superconductor mesa : it should be much smaller than the em wavelength on one hand , which renders the superconductor mesa a cavity , and on the other hand , it should be thick enough to avoid large surface effects .",
    "the samples of @xmath12 m adopted in the experiment @xcite satisfy these requests well .",
    "the @xmath11 kink state is stable against other distortions , such as thermal fluctuations , inhomogeneity of physical parameters , and so on .",
    "the present work is motivated by two recent experiments on thz radiations from thin mesas of bscco single crystals .",
    "the first one is a detection of thz radiations from a cylindrical mesa @xcite , after the theoretical proposal @xcite for testifying the boundary condition of the system .",
    "the second one is an observation on em standing waves in a rectangular mesa @xcite , an approach being able to provide direct evidence for cavity resonance .",
    "the remaining part of the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the right boundary condition for thin mesas from a theoretical point of view",
    ". then we point out that the result of the recent experiment using a cylindrical mesa is to be understood in accordance with this boundary condition . in sec .",
    "iii , the radius dependence of the radiation frequency for first several modes is presented , accompanied with the spatial distributions of the @xmath11 kink in superconductivity phase difference , supercurrent , as well as the em standing wave .",
    "section  iv is devoted to a new proposal of using annular mesa , which can reduce the joule heating and enhance the leakage of heat as compared with the cylindrical one . by checking the frequency variation upon tuning aspect ratio",
    ", it is displayed that tailoring the mesa geometry may be a prosperous way to improve the present technique for thz stimulation .",
    "finally summary and perspectives are given in sec .",
    "the inductively coupled sine - gordon equations for the gauge - invariant phase differences in a stack of josephson junctions with a dc current bias and dissipations are given in the dimensionless form as @xcite    @xmath13    under the neumann boundary condition in the later directions @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the inductive coupling and @xmath16 is the @xmath2-axis conductivity ; @xmath17 the laplace operator in lateral directions , and @xmath18 the second difference operator along the @xmath2 axis",

    "unfortunately , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are both eigenfunctions of the laplace equation , derivative to each other , and give the same wave number ( or equivalently frequency in dimensionless form ) @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , from a pure experimental point of view , the dependence of frequency on the system size can not determine uniquely the mode .",
    "a mesa of cylindrical shape was proposed to testify uniquely the dynamics of the superconductivity phase difference inside the junctions @xcite . for the cylinder geometry ,",
    "the radial part of an eigenfunction of the laplace equation is given by the bessel function , not their derivatives .",
    "the boundary condition for the cylinder geometry determines uniquely the wave number , and vice versa , since the zeros of the bessel functions are different from the zeros of their derivatives , contrasting to sine and cosine functions in the rectangle geometry .",
    "therefore , measuring by experiments the frequency of em radiation from a cylindrical mesa of given radius and assigning the mode by the properties of bessel functions enable one to identify uniquely the right boundary condition for the em waves .",

    "the wave number observed in the experiment @xcite is given by @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath54 is the first zero of derivative of the bessel function @xmath55 , it is inferred that the mode ( 1,1 ) has been achieved in the experiment .",
    "the most important message from the experiment is that the frequency of em radiation is determined by the zero of derivative of the bessel function , in agreement with the theoretical analysis @xcite .",
    "the right boundary condition for the cavity therefore is that the tangential component of the oscillating magnetic field should be zero at the edges as discussed above , consistent with the analysis in ref .",

    "the obvious advantage of the annular geometry is the reduction of heating , since the area of sample is reduced which suppresses the total joule heating and the inner surface of the sample may enhance heat leakage additionally . the effect of removing the central part of a cylindrical mesa , thus rendering an annular one , on the redistribution of the superconductivity phase difference , the supercurrent and the em waves is analyzed .",
    "it is shown that , depending on the mode , the radiation frequency varies with the aspect ratio in different ways , and there is plenty of room for modification of the em radiation by tailoring the shape of sample , while keeping low heating .",
    "superconductor samples of annular geometry can also be manufactured as a waveguide resonator , where fragments of superconductor mesas are arranged in a thread with each satisfying the condition of small thickness compared with the wavelength of electromagnetic wave . in contrast with the fiber lasers developed for visible lights",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , the lasing mode propagates along the annular superconductor , whereas the electromagnetic waves within the inner surface establishes the coherent oscillation in thread of superconductor mesas . when the outer surface is shielded by wrapping a jacket made of appropriate materials , the wave propagating in the wave guide can be enhanced .",
