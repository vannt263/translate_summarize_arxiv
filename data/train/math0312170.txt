    "in other words the constellation @xmath40 is required to operate fixed point free on the vector space @xmath84 . using a classical classification result of fixed point free unitary representations by zassenhaus  @xcite , shokrollahi et al .",

    "in most of the literature mentioned above researchers focus their attention to constellations having the special form  .",
    "unitary differential modulation  @xcite is used to avoid sending the identity ( upper part of every element in the constellation ) redundantly .",
    "this increases the transmission rate by a factor of 2 to :    @xmath86    because of this reason we will also focus ourselves in the later part of the paper to the special form   as well .",
    "nonetheless it will become obvious that the numerical techniques also work in the general situation .      as we mentioned before a constellation with a large diversity sum will have a small diversity function at small values of the signal to noise ratio .",
    "this is particularly suitable when the system operates in a very noisy environment .",

    "it is the objective to make @xmath92 as small as possible for every pair of @xmath93 .",
    "it follows that at high snr , the probability primarily depends on @xmath94 , but at low snr , the probability primarily depends on @xmath95 . in order to be able to compare the constellation of different dimensions , we define :    [ div - sum ] the _ diversity sum _ of a unitary constellation @xmath40",
    "is defined as @xmath96    again one has the important special case where @xmath73 and the matrices @xmath8 take the special form  . in this case one",
    "verifies that @xmath97    for the form   the diversity sum assumes the following simple form : @xmath98 without mentioning the term the concept of diversity sum was used in  @xcite .",
    "liang and xia  @xcite explicitly defined the diversity sum in the situation when @xmath73 using equation  .",
    "definition  [ div - sum ] naturally generalizes the definition to arbitrary constellations .",
    "we want to point out that the diversity sum is the design criterion only for unitary constellation .",
    "hochwald and marzetta  @xcite calculate the non - coherent space time channel capacity and indicate that unitary signal constellation are capacity achieving signal sets only for high snr scenarios . for low snr case",
    ", the transmitting power should be allocated unsymmetrically , i.e. , unitary constellations are not capacity achieving in the first place .",
    "however unitary signal sets are easily manageable and one can take advantage of differential modulation technique  @xcite to speed up the transmission . moreover our simulation results indicate that codes with near optimal diversity sum tend to perform significantly better compared to the currently existing ones optimized for the diversity product for low and even moderate snr scenarios .",
    "so it is quite reasonable and more toward the practical use to construct unitary constellations with good diversity sum .    as the formulas make it clear the diversity sum and the diversity product are in general very different .",
