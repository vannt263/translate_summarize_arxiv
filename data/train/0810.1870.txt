    "in our previous papers @xcite , we calibrated the relation between peak energy @xmath0 and peak luminosity @xmath1 of prompt grb emission ( so called yonetoku relation @xcite ) by 33 low - redshift grbs ( @xmath14 ) whose luminosity distances were estimated from sneia @xcite .",
    "then we used the calibrated yonetoku relation as a distance indicator like the period - luminosity relation of cepheid variables , and extended the hubble diagram up to @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite showed that grbs constrain cosmological parameters in a different way from sneia , and grbs could be useful to probe cosmological expansion of high - redshift universe where no snia has been observed .",
    "the amati relation @xcite is another relation for prompt emission property .",
    "it involves peak energy @xmath0 and isotropic energy @xmath16 , and was originally derived under a given set of cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore , the circularity problem arises if one applies naively the amati relation to determine cosmological parameters . to overcome this difficulty , in this paper , we first calibrate the amati relation as we did for yonetoku relation without assuming any cosmological models but using luminosity distance given by sneia for @xmath7 .    although the strong correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 are generally confirmed , we found little trend between their data residuals of @xmath17 and @xmath18 from the best fit function of each relation .",
    "we suggest statistical independence of amati and yonetoku relations while these two relations have the same parameter @xmath0 (  -2 ) .",
    "next , we will extend the hubble diagram with the obtained relations and make constraints on density parameters , ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is shown that the two hubble diagrams differ systematically at high redshifts and , as a result , two different constraints are obtained (  -3 ) .",
    "although the difference is not so significant ( 1-@xmath8 level ) , taking the relatively large systematic errors in the two relations themselves into consideration , it is suggested that there may be a hidden parameter which characterizes the prompt emission and reduces the systematic error of the distance indicator .",
    "we introduce the luminosity time ( @xmath10 ) as a possible hidden parameter to derive the @xmath0-@xmath9-@xmath1 relation , and put constraints on cosmological parameters (  -4 ) .",
    "finally we give some comments on other relations used as distance indicators in the past , and argue the advantage of our new relation (  -5 ) . throughout the paper ,",
    "we fix the current hubble parameter as @xmath20 .",
    "we note that , in whole this paper , tentatively we do not take possible selection effects and evolution effects on relations into accounts although a hot debate @xcite exists .",
    "we think that the final resolution needs the increase of the events with enough well determined parameters such as redshifts , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 since we should divide all data into several sub groups to check possible selection effects and evolution effects .",
    "the typical spectrum of the prompt emission of grbs can be expressed as exponentially connected broken power - law , so called band function @xcite",
    ". then we can determine spectral peak energy @xmath0 , corresponding to the photon energy at maximum in @xmath22 spectra .",
    "there are two empirical relations that relate prompt emission property with @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0-@xmath2 relation is the first one found by @xcite , which connects @xmath0 with the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath2 .",
    "the second one is @xmath0-@xmath1 relation found by @xcite which was used in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "we first calibrate amati relation in the same way as in our previous papers @xcite and analyze the correlation of the residuals of grb data from the relations and the partial correlation coefficient .",
    "if there are a small degree of correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath3 after removing the effect of @xmath0 , it suggest the possible independence of the distance indicators , and might suggest the existence of a hidden parameter common to each relation .",
    "we found an empirical formula for the luminosity distance as a function of redshift from 192 sneia observations @xcite , @xmath23 the reduced chi - square of the formula is @xmath24 .",
    "note here that the formula is not unique and a different formula is possible .",
    "note also that we do not assume any cosmological models at this stage , but simply assume that the type ia supernovae are the standard candles for @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the errors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dl_sn ] ) in the following analysis , which leads to the underestimation of errors in cosmological parameters .",
    "our purpose here is to compare distance indicators and find a better indicator so that this neglect would be reasonable .",

    "the factor 2c in the front of @xmath72 comes from the fact that the definition of @xmath9 includes @xmath1 .",

    "the luminosity is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the photospheric radius , the gamma factor and co - moving temperature of the photosphere , respectively .",
    "since @xcite assume that the energy is supplied by the relativistic collision of the rapid shell of mass @xmath79 and lorenz factor @xmath80 with the slow shell of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then under the perfectly inelastic collision model , @xmath77 is given by @xmath83 . since @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ", we can reduce @xmath86 . if we regard @xmath87 , we can rewrite eq.([eq : photoshere ] ) as @xmath88 now let us assume @xmath76 , @xmath81 and @xmath89 are constants .",
    "then we have @xmath90 the above relation is essentially the same as eq.([eq : new ] ) if we consider 2-@xmath8 error of the power index in eq.([eq : new ] ) .",
    "possible reasons for the above three assumptions are as follows . in @xcite model",
    "@xmath76 is similar to the radius of the progenitor star so that it could be constant .",
    "@xmath9 can be regarded as the effective duration of the burst .",
    "then @xmath91 is the radius that the last rapid shell catches the slow shell and we expect that this is also the order of the radius of the progenitor star , which is constant .",
    "we have no reason why @xmath81 is constant .",
    "however if @xmath81 obeys the log normal distribution like the other observables in grbs we may regard it essentially constant .",
    "if these assumptions are reasonable , the new relation ( eq.([eq : new ] ) ) could be derived in the photospheric model of the prompt emission of grbs like @xcite .",
    "finally we use this new relation to put constraints on cosmological parameters . here",

    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are pioneering works for grb cosmology , but they are caught in circularity problem because there are few grbs at low redshift .",
    "@xcite obtained cosmological constraints from lag ( @xmath97)-luminosity relation , variability ( @xmath98)-luminosity relation , @xmath0-jet collimated energy ( @xmath99 ) relation ( so called ghirlanda relation ) , minimum rise time ( @xmath100)-luminosity relation , and yonetoku relation .",
    "@xcite calibrated these relations by luminosity distances from snia observations .",
    "however , @xcite showed redshift dependence of @xmath97-@xmath1 relation analyzing 565 baste grb samples with pseudo - redshifts estimated by yonetoku relation .",
    "this suggests that the relation can not be used as a distance indicator .",
    "the dependence might come from the fact that @xmath101s were evaluated from several fixed energy bands depending on the detectors and they are different energy in grb rest frame , so it suffer from k - correction problem .",
    "this argument applies to @xmath98s and @xmath100s .",
    "although @xmath0-@xmath99 relation and liang & zhang relation have much smaller systematic errors than both yonetoku and amati relations , there are many grbs without a jet break or with multiple jet breaks ( missing or multiple jet break problem ) so that it is not certain whether the jet break can be used to characterize grb emission .",
    "in contrast , our new relation does not suffer from these problems , because it is totally defined by the prompt emission property and it has as a small systematic error as @xmath0-@xmath99 and liang & zhang relations .",
    "thus we could expect that the new relation would put grb cosmology to the next promising stage , as phillips relation @xcite and fundamental plane @xcite did for sneia and elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , we must emphasize that we need detailed studies of the new relation with much larger number of grbs and examination of systematic errors in order for grb to be regarded as a reliable tool for cosmology like snia , cosmic microwave background , baryon acoustic oscillation and gravitational lens . now",
