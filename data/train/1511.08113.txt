    "ikenmeyer and panova  @xcite showed that the vanishing of rectangular kronecker coefficients can not be used to prove superpolynomial lower bounds on the determinantal complexity of the permanent polynomials !",
    "recall that by theorem  [ th : kl ] , an occurence obstruction  @xmath139 proving @xmath131 necessarily satisfies @xmath371 and @xmath193 .",
    "( by a minor modification of the notion of padded permanents , we may even assume @xmath372 . )",
    "this result does not yet rule out the occurence based approach towards @xmath375 as outlined in section  [ se : attempt ] , since it refers to the kronecker coefficients @xmath179 of rectangular partitions and not to the gct - coefficients @xmath178 .",
    "( recall those are the multiplicities in the coordinate ring of the orbit closure of @xmath97 ; see and theorem  [ th : ms ] . )",
    "the main ingredient behind the proof of theorem  [ th : bip ] , besides a splitting technique as for theorem  [ th : ip ] , is the encoding of a generating system of highest weight vectors in plethysms @xmath378 by ( classes of ) tableaux with contents @xmath379 , as well as the analysis of their evaluation at tensors of rank one in a combinatorial way .",
    "this is similar to @xcite .",
    "a further technique is the `` lifting '' of highest weight vectors of @xmath378 , when increasing the inner degree  @xmath13 , as introduced by kadish and landsberg  @xcite .",
    "this is closely related to stability property of the plethysm coefficients @xcite .",
    "remarkably , for the proof of theorem  [ th : bip ] , the only information needed about the orbit closures @xmath97 is that they contain certain padded power sums , see also  @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that there still remains the possibility that the approach via representation theoretic obstructions may succeed when comparing multiplicities .",
    "indeed , if the orbit closure @xmath380 of the padded permanent @xmath381 is contained in @xmath97 , then the restriction defines a surjective @xmath101-equivariant homomorphism @xmath382\\to\\c[z_{n , m}]$ ] of the coordinate rings , and hence the multiplicity of the type @xmath139 in @xmath383 $ ] is bounded from above by the gct - coefficient @xmath178 .",
    "thus , proving that @xmath178 is strictly smaller than the latter multiplicity implies that @xmath384 .",
    "mumuley pointed out to us a paper by larsen and pink  @xcite that is of potential interest in this connection .      to conclude , even if the approach via multiplicities should turn out to be impossible as well , we should keep in mind that the noncontainment of orbit closures in principle can be proved by exhibiting some highest weight vector functions ( see ( * ? ? ?",
