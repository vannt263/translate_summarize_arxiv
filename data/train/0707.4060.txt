    "circumstellar ( cs ) disks surrounding pre - main sequence stars are supposed to be the location of planet building .",
    "the characterization of the gaseous component , which initially represents 99%  of the total disk mass , is a key research question towards an understanding of protoplanetary disks and planet formation .",
    "however , from previous observations , little is known about the gas compared to the dust .",
    "major questions concerning planet formation remain .",
    "how massive are the disks ?",
    "can giant planets form in every disk ?",
    "how long does the planet formation process take ?",
    "detailed information is required about the gas in disks in order to address these questions .",
    "in particular , characterizing the warm gas phase in the inner disk ( r@xmath450 au ) , where planet formation is supposed to take place , is an essential step .",
    "molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) is the main constituent of the molecular cloud from which the young star is formed and is also expected to be the main component of the cs disk .",
    "it is expected to be at least 10@xmath5 times more abundant than other gas tracers such as carbon monoxide ( co ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since it self - shields very efficiently against photodissociation by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons and does not freeze effectively onto grain surfaces .",
    "h@xmath0 is the only molecule that can directly constrain the mass reservoir of warm and hot molecular gas in disks .",
    "indeed , the detection of h@xmath0 excited by collisions allows us to measure the temperature and density of the warm gas .",
    "unfortunately , direct observation of h@xmath0 is difficult .",
    "electronic transitions occur in the ultraviolet to which the earth s atmosphere is opaque , and rotational and ro - vibrational transitions at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths are faint because of their quadrupolar origin .",
    "fuv absorption lines have been observed with the _ fuse _  satellite in the spectrum of some herbig ae stars ( haes ) and show the presence of warm ( t@xmath6 k ) molecular hydrogen gas in the cs environment of these stars @xcite .",
    "however , absorption observations require specific configurations to observe the gas within the disks , i.e. nearly edge - on .",
    "due to the high inclination angles to the lines of sight estimated for the disks observed by @xcite , the detected h@xmath0 is not in the disk .",
    "those authors concluded that the lines of sight probably pass through a thin layer of warm / hot gas above the surface of the disk which is produced by the photoevaporation of the disk .",
    "searches for mid - ir h@xmath0 rotational emission lines have been performed using different space- and ground - based instruments .",
    "space - based instruments on iso and spitzer have low spectral and spatial resolution , and therefore have not yielded an unambiguous detection of h@xmath0 line emission from protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "indeed , when detections of h@xmath0 towards a few pre - main sequence stars have been claimed with iso - sws @xcite , ground - based observations showed that contamination from surrounding cloud material was important and that iso detections were likely not dominated by the emission of the disk gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite estimated the line - to - continuum ratio that should be observed for h@xmath0 transitions in the mid - ir .",
    "they used a two - layer model @xcite of a gas - rich disk ( column density of n(h@xmath0)=10@xmath7 cm@xmath2 ) seen face - on , located at 140 pc from the sun , with local thermodynamics equilibrium ( lte ) for the gas and dust , t@xmath9=t@xmath10 , and assuming a gas - to - dust mass ratio about 100 .",
    "those authors concluded that the expected peak flux of the s(1 ) line at 17.035 @xmath1 m , observed at a spectral resolution of 20000 , should be less than 0.3%  of that of the continuum at temperatures higher than 150 k , and thus should not be observable with the existing instruments .",
    "indeed , they did not detect any h@xmath0 mid - ir emission line in their sample of 6 herbig ae stars .",
    "however , h@xmath0 rotational lines have been recently detected in the disk around one herbig ae star , namely ab aur , with the high spectral and spatial resolution texes spectrometer @xcite .",
    "these detections imply that h@xmath0 can be observed in the mid - ir domain when particular physical conditions exist in disks .",
    "the _ vlt imager and spectrometer for the mid - infrared _ ( _ visir _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has the high spectral ( @xmath11 ) and spatial resolution necessary to pick up such narrow gas lines from the disks .",
    "in addition , high spectral resolution is a key element to disentangle the h@xmath0 line from the absorption lines due to the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the spectral ranges covered by _ visir _",
    "offer access to the most intense pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) : s(1 ) ( @xmath12 ) at 17.0348 @xmath1 m , s(2 ) ( @xmath13 ) at 12.2786 @xmath1 m , s(3 ) ( @xmath14 ) at 9.6649 @xmath1 m , and s(4 ) ( @xmath15 ) at 8.0250 @xmath1 m .",
    "the s(0 ) ( @xmath16 ) transition near 28 @xmath1 m is not observable from the ground due to the earth s atmospheric absorption .",
    "a particularly interesting object to study the cs material around a pre - main sequence intermediate mass star is hd97048 .",
    "hd97048 is a nearby , relatively isolated herbig a0/b9 star located in the chameleon cloud at a distance of 180 pc @xcite .",
    "its age has been estimated from evolutionary tracks to be of the order of 3 million years ( kindly computed by l. testi and a. palacios ) .",
    "this star is known to be surrounded by an extended cs disk .",
    "the _ visir _",
    "imaging observations of this star conducted in 2005 june 17 and 19 , have revealed an extended emission of pahs ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) at the surface of a flared disk inclined to the line of sight by 42.8@xmath17 degrees @xcite .",
    "this is the only herbig star for which the flaring of the disk has been observed by direct imaging .",
    "the flaring index has been measured to be 1.26@xmath180.05 , in good agreement with hydrostatic flared disk models @xcite .",
    "this geometry implies that a large amount of gas should be present to support the flaring structure and that the disk is at an early stage of evolution .",

    ", we present _ visir",
    "_  observations of the s(1 ) pure rotational emission line of molecular hydrogen at 17.03 @xmath1 m arising from the disk of hd97048 .",
    "hd97048 was observed for 1800s with the high spectral resolution long - slit mode of _ visir _  in june 22 , 2006 . the central wavelength of the observation was set to 17.035 @xmath1 m .",
    "we used the 0.75  slit , providing a spectral resolution about 10000 , i.e. @xmath19=30 kms@xmath20 .",
    "the weather conditions were very good and stable during the observations ; the optical seeing was less than 0.66  and the airmass ( @xmath41.8 ) was close to the minimum airmass accessible when observing this object from the paranal eso observatory .",
    "the standard `` chopping and nodding '' technique was used to suppress the large sky and telescope background dominating at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "secondary mirror chopping was performed in the north - south direction with an amplitude of 8  at a frequency of 0.025 hz . nodding technique , necessary to compensate for chopping residuals , was applied using a telescope offset of 8  in the south direction , every 3 minutes .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.127/pixel resulting in a total field of view along the slit about 32.5  .",
    "the elementary frames were combined to obtain chopping / nodding corrected data .",
    "_ visir _  detector is affected by stripes randomly triggered by some abnormal high - gain pixels .",
    "a dedicated destriping method has been developped to suppress them ( pantin 2007 , in preparation ) . in order to correct the spectrum from the earth s atmospheric absorption and obtain the absolute flux calibration",
    ", we observed the ceres asteroid and the standard star hd89388 ( see www.eso.org/visir/catalogue ) just before and after observing hd97048 . hd89388 and ceres",
    "were observed at nearly the same airmass and seeing conditions as the object . as shown in fig .",
    "[ ceres]_b _ , airmasses are slightly different between the observation of ceres and that of hd97048",
    ". however , the discrepancy between the two spectra of the sky can not be responsible for the emission feature we observe in the hd97048 spectrum around 17.035@xmath1 m , i.e. the h@xmath0 line ( fig .",
    "[ ceres]_a _ ) .",
    "we thus have divided the spectrum of hd97048 by that of ceres ( which has a much better signal - to - noise ratio than that of the standard star hd89388 ) to correct for the telluric absorption , and used the hd89388 observed and modelled spectra @xcite to obtain the absolute flux calibration .",
    "the wavelength calibration is done by fitting the observed sky background features with a model of the paranal s atmospheric emission .",
    "we note that @xcite found a@xmath21=0.24 mag from the fit of the _ iue _  spectrum of hd97048 , thus we have not corrected the spectrum for dust extinction , since it is neglectible in our wavelength range for a@xmath21@xmath22 mag @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ raie]_a _ , we have detected the h@xmath0 pure rotational s(1 ) line near 17.03 @xmath1 m . in the flux - calibrated spectrum ,",
    "the standard deviation ( @xmath23 ) of the continuum flux was calculated in regions less influenced by telluric absorption , and close to the feature of interest .",
    "we deduced a 6@xmath23 detection in amplitude for the line , corresponding to a signal - to - noise of about 11@xmath23 for the line , when integrating the signal over a resolution element ( 6 pixels ) .",
    "the line is not resolved as we can fit it with a gaussian with a full width at half maximum equal to a spectral resolution element of 30 kms@xmath20  ( see fig .",
    "[ raie]_a _ ) . from our fit , assuming the emission arises from an isothermal mass of optically thin h@xmath0 , we derived an integrated flux in the line of 2.4@xmath2410@xmath25 w m@xmath2 or 2.4@xmath2410@xmath26 ergss@xmath20cm@xmath2 .    once the spectrum is corrected from the earth s rotation , and knowing the heliocentric radial velocity of hd97048 ( + 21 kms@xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimated , from the wavelength position of the gaussian peak , the radial velocity of h@xmath0 to be about 4@xmath182 kms@xmath20 in the star s rest frame .",
    "we thus considered that the radial velocity of the h@xmath0 is similar to that of the star , implying that the emitting gas is bound to the star .",
    "the h@xmath0 line is not resolved spatially .",
    "given the _",
    "visir _  spatial resolution of about 0.427  at 17.03 @xmath1 m , and the star distance ( 180 pc from the sun ) , we can assess that the emitting h@xmath0 is located within the inner 35 au of the disk ( fig .",
    "[ raie]_b _ ) .",
    "we estimated the corresponding column densities and masses as a function of prescribed temperatures ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , we first assumed that the line is optically thin and that the radiation is isotropic .",
    "in this context , assuming that the first rotational levels ( up to @xmath27 ) of h@xmath0 are thermalized , and thus that their populations follow the boltzmann law for a given temperature ( lte ) , the column densities are derived from the following formula :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the integrated intensity of the line , @xmath30 is the wavelength of the transition @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the spontaneous transition probability , @xmath33 is the column density of the upper rotational level of the transition .",
    "since the line is not spatially resolved , we calculated a lower limit on @xmath29 by dividing the integrated flux value by the solid angle of the point spread function , and thus obtained lower limits on the total column densities . under the same assumptions as used for the calculations of the column densities and assuming that the medium we observe is homogeneous , the mass of warm h@xmath0 is given by @xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the line flux , @xmath36 the distance in pc to the star , @xmath37 is the fractional population of the level @xmath38 at the temperature @xmath39 in lte ( for details on the calculation method , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath40 is the conversion factor required for deriving the total gas mass from the h@xmath0-ortho or h@xmath0-para mass . since m@xmath41=m@xmath41(ortho)+m@xmath41(para ) , @xmath40 = 1 + 1/(ortho / para ) for the s(1 ) line ( a h@xmath0-ortho transition ) .",
    "the equilibrium ortho - para ratio at the temperature t was computed using @xcite .",
    "we also estimated the dust mass producing the flux level of the continuum in the spectrum .",
    "we used a simple model of optically thin emission of a given mass of dust at the surface of a disk .",
    "the grains have sizes between 0.01 and 100 @xmath1 m and a size distribution following a power - law with an index of -3.5 . a fixed composition , mixture of amorphous silicates ( 50% ) and amorphous carbon ( 50% )",
    "is assumed . for different temperatures ( 150 , 300 , 1000 k ) assigned to the dust , we computed the corresponding mass of dust and derived gas - to - dust mass ratios .",
    "our results are tabulated in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "our high resolution spectroscopic observation of the s(1 ) pure rotational line of h@xmath0 at 17.03 @xmath1 m of hd97048 has revealed the presence of significant amounts of warm gas in the inner 35 au of the disk . from a gaussian fit of the emission line , we derived very high column densities of warm gas , which are more than two orders of magnitude higher than those generally observed in the cs environment of herbig ae stars @xcite .",
    "this confirms that hd97048 is a young object surrounded by a circumstellar disk at an early stage of evolution .",
    "indeed photoevaporation of the gas is expected to clear up the inner part of the disk within 3 million years @xcite .",
    "we derived masses of the warm gas in the range from 10@xmath2 to nearly 1 m@xmath3 ( 1 m@xmath3 @xmath42 10@xmath43 m@xmath44 ) depending on the adopted temperature , and assuming lte .",
    "the masses derived here are lower than those of @xcite who have estimated a minimum mass of gas in the inner disk to be of the order of 3 m@xmath3 .",
    "but it should be pointed out that mid - ir h@xmath0 lines are only probing warm gas located in the surface layer of the disk , when a higher mass of colder gas is expected to be present in the interior layers of the disk . in any case , the finding of warm molecular hydrogen reinforces the claim that a large amount of cold gas is present in the disk to support its flaring geometry @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the first rotational levels ( @xmath45 ) of h@xmath0 are populated by thermal collisions , an excitation mechanism which requires kinetic temperatures higher than 150 k to produce the s(1 ) transition . assuming equal dust and gas temperatures , we estimated dust masses responsible for the continuum emission and derived gas - to - dust mass ratios in the range from 3260 to 14164 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) , much larger than the canonical value of 100 .",
    "these crude estimates are in agreement with more sophisticated models such as two - layer lte disk models @xcite . indeed , by scaling the gas - to - dust mass ratio found here to the canonical value of 100",
    ", we obtained a peak line flux of about 0.46%  of that of the continuum at 150 k , decreasing to 0.1%  of the continuum at 1000 k , which is close to the line - to - conitnuum ratios calculated in disks models by @xcite .",
    "thus one possible interpretation of our observation is that the dust is partially depleted from the disk surface layer , where the h@xmath0 emission originates .",
    "the spatial decoupling between the gas and the dust may be due to dust settling or dust coagulation into larger particles .",
    "however , other excitation mechanism can not be excluded .",
    "several competing mechanisms could contribute to the excitation of molecular hydrogen such as uv pumping , shocks , x - rays , etc ... , ( see review papers by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and could be responsible for the observed emission .",
    "weak x - ray emission has been detected from hd97048 by rosat @xcite .",
    "x - rays and uv photons are likely candidates to heat the gas to temperatures significantly higher than those of the dust @xcite and could partly explain a high line - to - continuum ratio . according to radiative transfer models of disks around t tauri stars @xcite",
    ", x - ray heating could significantly increase the line - to - continuum flux ratio , but , applying the same increase factor to haes , the s(1 ) h@xmath0 line would still be below the detection limit of _",

    "new observations of hd97048 will be performed with _ visir _  in order to observe the other pure rotational lines of h@xmath0 .",
    "the detection of these lines would help to better constrain the temperature ( and thus the mass ) of the warm gas .",
    "our results are very similar to those obtained by @xcite for ab aur with the texes instrument .",
    "indeed , those authors have shown that the emitting warm gas is located in the inner 18 au of the disk around ab aur .",
    "for the two stars , the gas has not completely dissipated in the inner region of the disk in a lifetime of about 3 myrs .",
    "hd97048 and ab aur have nearly identical astrophysical parameters ( t@xmath46 , age , mass , distance ) .",
    "their disks are flared @xcite and seem to be in similar evolutionary states , which could well be a disk old enough such that the dust sedimenation / coagulation has already been at work , but young enough such that the gas has not yet been photoevaporated .",
    "it is not possible to draw definite conclusions with only two examples and it would be interesting to observe other hae stars similar to ab aur and hd97048 .",
