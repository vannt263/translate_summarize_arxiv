    "in relativistic astrophysics , understanding the nature and exact composition of a specific class of compact stars which are more compact than ordinary neutron stars , has become a field of active research in recent years .",
    "a neutron star is the final stage of a gravitationally collapsed star which , after exhausting all its thermo - nuclear fuel , gets stabilized by degenerate neutron pressure . soon after the discovery of the particle ` neutron ' by chadwick , the existence of neutron star was predicted .",
    "later on , the concept got observational support with the discovery of pulsars@xcite . with the progress in our understanding of particle interactions at high energy , theoretical modelling of neutron stars",
    "have improved considerably over the last few decades@xcite .",
    "however , the nature of particle interactions beyond nuclear density is still poorly understood .",
    "the conjecture that quark matter might be the true ground state of hadrons@xcite , has led to the discussions of an entirely new class of stellar bodies composed of deconfined @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks , called ` strange stars ' .",
    "it is interesting to note that a strange matter equation of state ( eos ) seems to explain the observed compactness of many astrophysical objects like her x-1 , 4u 1820 - 30 , sax j 1808.4 - 3658 , 4u 1728 - 34 , psr 0943 + 10 and rx j185635 - 3754 , whose estimated compactness , otherwise , can not be explained in terms of a neutron star eos@xcite .",
    "though many more exotic phases may exist at the interior of such class of stars , in this paper , we shall restrict our discussions to the strange matter eos only .",
    "we shall choose a simple eos for strange quark matter based on the mit bag model where the quark confinement is assumed to be caused by a universal pressure @xmath3 , called the bag constant@xcite .",
    "the bag model essentially describes the confinement mechanism of quarks inside hadrons . by imposing the condition that the energy per baryon of strange matter be less than that of the nucleon ( @xmath4mev ) , farhi and jaffe@xcite",
    "have shown that for a stable strange quark matter the bag constant should be @xmath5mev/@xmath6 .",
    "once the strange matter eos is known , one can employ numerical techniques to get an estimate of the gross features of a strange star by integrating the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff(tov ) equations . from the general relativistic view point , question is , what would be the relevant back ground space - time to model such class of compact stars ? in a recent work , avellar and horvath@xcite have considered a wide set of exact and approximate solutions to model strange stars .",
    "the objective of the current investigation is to look for a physically viable analytical model which can describe such class of compact stars . to this end",
    ", we explore the possibility of applying the krori and barua@xcite ( henceforth kb ) metric to describe the interior space - time of a strange star .",
    "the kb model is singularity free and has earlier been shown to be useful to describe realistic stars@xcite .",
    "ivanov@xcite has shown that the kb model satisfies the necessary energy conditions of a realistic star .",
    "et al_@xcite , for a einstein - maxwell system , have used the kb model to describe a self - gravitating , charged , anisotropic fluid sphere satisfying a linear and/or non - linear eos .",
    "the key observations made by them are as follows : ( i ) spheres with vanishing net charge contain fluid elements with unbounded proper charge density located at the fluid - vacuum interface ; ( ii ) inward - directed fluid forces caused by pressure anisotropy may allow equilibrium configurations with larger net charges and electric field intensities than those found in studies of charged isotropic fluids ; ( iii ) possible applications of the model to describe charged strange quark stars , dark matter distributions and massive charged particles . in a separate paper , farook _",
    "et al_@xcite have used the kb model to analyze an anisotropic , charged , static , spherically symmetric fluid source .",
    "it has been shown that the inclusion of a tangential pressure - like variable admits a non - linear , chaplygin - type eos .",
    "interestingly , the two approaches coincide for an eos of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the energy density , @xmath9 the pressure and @xmath10 is a model parameter describing the stiffness of the eos .",
    "the results obtained by varela _",
    "et al _ may be regained by farook _",
    "et al_s@xcite approach .",
    "they too predicted a possible extrapolation of the investigation to the case of astrophysical bodies , in particular , for a quark star of radius @xmath11 km .",
    "the present investigation is a follow up of the earlier works done by varela",
    "_ et al_@xcite and rahaman _ et al_@xcite . in the present work",
    ", we shall incorporate the bag model eos in the kb model and study the subsequent stellar configurations .",
    "it is to be noted here that once we specify the eos , we can integrate the tov equations to derive the gross features of a stellar configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "if one of the metric functions is assumed a priori , one can determine the subsequent eos of the material composition of the star .",
    "however , if both the metric functions as well as the eos are provided , it becomes an over determined system .",
    "to overcome the situation , we include two additional input parameters into the system .",
    "note that the kb model was originally developed for a charged neutral , isotropic and spherically symmetric object in static equilibrium .",
    "we assume here that the composition of the strange star is anisotropic in nature coupled with high electric field .",
    "these assumptions are justified due to the following reasons : strange stars are extremely dense objects and at very high density , it is expected that the pressure should be anisotropic in nature@xcite .",
    "the electric field at the surface of a strange star has also been reported to be very high@xcite .",
    "implications of these additional parameters on the physical behaviour of the strange star will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the paper has been organized as follows : in sect .",

    "one of the advantages of using the kb metric is that there there is no singularity in its metric functions .",
    "proper bounds , however , should be imposed on the conatants appearing in the metric functions so that all the physically significant parameters remain well behaved at all interior points of the star .      from eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , we obtain the central density in the form @xmath38 for regularity of the electric field , it must vanish at the centre , i.e. , @xmath39 which yields @xmath40 substituting the value of @xmath3 in eq .",
