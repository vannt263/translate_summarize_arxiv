    "the dimension two condensate @xmath2 has received a great deal of attention in the last few years , see for example @xcite .",
    "this condensate was already introduced in @xcite in order to analyze the gluon propagator within the operator product expansion ( ope ) , while in @xcite the condensate @xmath5 was considered in the coulomb gauge .",
    "a renormalizable effective potential for @xmath2 has been constructed and evaluated in analytic form up to two - loop order in the landau gauge within the local composite operator ( lco ) formalism in @xcite .",
    "the output of these investigations is that a non - vanishing condensate is favoured as it lowers the vacuum energy .",
    "the renormalizability of the local composite operator formalism , see @xcite for an introduction to the method , was proven to all orders of perturbation theory , in the case of @xmath4 , in @xcite using the algebraic renormalization technique @xcite .",
    "besides the landau gauge , the method was extended to other gauges as , for instance , the curci - ferrari gauge @xcite , the linear covariant gauges @xcite and , more recently , the maximal abelian gauge @xcite .",
    "+   + as a consequence of the existence of a non - vanishing condensate @xmath4 , a dynamical mass parameter for the gluons can be generated in the gauge fixed lagrangian , see @xcite .",
    "we mention that a gluon mass has been proven to be rather useful in the phenomenological context , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "moreover , mass parameters are commonly used in the fitting formulas for the data obtained in lattice simulations , where the gluon propagator has been studied to a great extent in the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "+   + the lattice results so far obtained have provided firm evidence of the suppression of the gluon propagator in the infrared region , in the landau gauge .",
    "next to the gluon propagator , also the ghost propagator has been investigated numerically on the lattice @xcite , exhibiting an infrared enhancement .",
    "it is worth remarking that , in agreement with lattice results , this infrared behaviour of the gluon as well as of the ghost propagator has been obtained in the analysis of the schwinger - dyson equations , see @xcite , as well as in a study making use of the exact renormalizaton group technique @xcite .",
    "+   + the aim of the present work is to investigate further the condensation of the operator @xmath0 in the landau gauge using the local composite operator formalism .",
    "this will be done by taking into account the nonperturbative effects related to the existence of the gribov ambiguities @xcite , which are known to affect the landau gauge fixing condition , @xmath6 . as a consequence of the existence of the gribov copies , the domain of integration in the path integral",
    "has to be restricted in a suitable way .",
    "gribov s orginal proposal was to restrict the domain of integration to the region @xmath1 whose boundary @xmath7 is the first gribov horizon , where the first vanishing eigenvalue of the faddeev - popov operator , @xmath8 , appears @xcite . within the region @xmath9",
    "the faddeev - popov operator is positive definite , i.e. @xmath10",
    ". one of the main results of gribov s work @xcite was that the gluon , respectively ghost propagator , got suppressed , respectively enhanced , in the infrared due to the restriction to the region @xmath1 .",
    "+   + in two previous papers @xcite , we have already worked out the consequences of the restriction to the gribov region @xmath1 when the dynamical generation of a gluon mass parameter due to @xmath4 takes place , also finding an infrared suppression of the gluon and an enhancement of the ghost propagator . in @xcite , we closely followed the setup of gribov s paper @xcite . in this work",
    ", we shall rely on the zwanziger local formulation of the gribov horizon . in a series of papers @xcite",
    ", zwanziger has been able to implement the restriction to the gribov region @xmath1 through the introduction of a nonlocal horizon function appearing in the boltzmann weight defining the euclidean yang - mills measure .",
    "more precisely , according to @xcite , the starting yang - mills measure in the landau gauge is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the so - called horizon function , which implements the restriction to the gribov region .",
    "notice that @xmath15 is nonlocal .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 , known as the gribov parameter , has the dimension of a mass and is not free , being determined by the horizon condition @xmath17 where the expectation value @xmath18 has to be evaluated with the measure @xmath19 .",
    "to the first order , the horizon condition ( [ m4 ] ) reads , in @xmath20 dimensions , @xmath21 this equation coincides with the original gap equation derived by gribov for the parameter @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "+   + albeit nonlocal , the horizon function @xmath15 can be localized through the introduction of a suitable set of additional fields .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the resulting local action turns out to be renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "remarkably , we shall be able to prove that this feature is preserved when the local operator @xmath0 is introduced in the zwanziger action .",
    "moreover , the resulting theory turns out to obey a homogeneous renormalization group equation .",
    "these important properties will allow us to study the condensation of the operator @xmath0 within a local renormalizable framework when the restriction to the gribov region @xmath1 is implemented .",
    "+   + it is worth remarking that the gribov region is not free from gauge copies @xcite , i.e. gribov copies still exist inside @xmath9 . to avoid the presence of these additional copies , a further restriction to a smaller region @xmath22 , known as the fundamental modular region ,",
    "should be implemented . at present , a clear understanding of the role played by these additional copies appears to be a very difficult task .",
    "nevertheless , we should mention that , recently , it has been argued in @xcite that the additional copies existing inside @xmath1 could have no influence on the expectation values , so that averages calculated over @xmath23 or @xmath1 might give the same value .",
    "+   + the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we give a short account of how the nonlocal horizon functional @xmath15 can be localized by means of the introduction of additional fields . in section 3 , we prove the renormalizability , to all orders of perturbation theory , of zwanziger s action in the presence of the operator @xmath0 , introduced through the local composite operator formalism . as the model has a rich symmetry structure , translated into several ward identities , it turns out that only three independent renormalization factors are necessary .",
    "the resulting quantum effective action obeys a homogeneous renormalization group equation , as explicitly verified at one - loop order . from this effective action , two coupled gap equations , associated to the condensate @xmath4 and to the gribov parameter @xmath16 ,",
    "are derived .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study of these gap equations at one - loop order in the @xmath3 renormalization scheme .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , under certain conditions , we find that it is possible that the condensate @xmath4 is positive when the horizon condition is imposed .",
    "we prove that in the @xmath3 scheme , and at one - loop order , the solution of the gap equations is necessarily one with @xmath24 .",
    "we recall that without the restriction to the gribov region @xmath1 , the value found for @xmath4 using the local composite operator formalism is negative , see @xcite .",
    "let us also mention here that in @xcite , a positive estimate for @xmath4 was obtained when using the ope in combination with @xmath2 .",
    "these works were based on the observation of a certain discrepancy at relatively large momentum between the expected perturbative behaviour and the obtained lattice behaviour of e.g. the effective strong coupling constant and gluon propagator .",
    "this discrepancy could be accounted for by power corrections in @xmath25 , due to a positive @xmath26 gluon condensate .",
    "the presence of such power corrections has also been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we do not know if there is a direct connection between the condensate @xmath4 that we determine , and @xmath27 , as the latter is expected to contain only infrared contributions , according to an ope treatment , while the gap equations fixing the gluon condensate and the gribov parameter are evaluated using perturbation theory , implying that reliable results are only to be expected at a sufficiently large scale .",
    "+   + although the expansion parameter proves to be rather large , an attempt to obtain explicit values for the gribov and gluon mass parameter is still presented .",
    "also , we shall prove that in the original gribov - zwanziger model , the vacuum energy is always positive at one - loop order , irrespective of the choice of renormalization scheme and scale .",
    "we outline the importance of the sign of the vacuum energy , as it is related to the gauge invariant gluon condensate @xmath28 , via the trace anomaly . from @xmath29",
    "the vacuum energy can be traced back to the value of the gluon condensate @xmath30 . in particular , for @xmath31 , from this anomaly one deduces @xmath32 where the one - loop @xmath33-function has been used .",
    "hence , a positive vacuum energy implies a negative value for the condensate @xmath34 .",
    "this is in contradiction with what is found . in qcd , with quarks present",
    ", one can extract phenomenological values for @xmath34 via the sum rules @xcite , obtaining positive values for this condensate .",
    "it was discussed in @xcite how to obtain an estimate for it by means of lattice calculations . in the case of @xmath31 yang - mills",
    "theory without quarks , it was found that @xmath35 let us mention here that the yang - mills @xmath33-function is negative up to the ( known ) four - loop order @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath36 and @xmath34 will continue to have opposite sign at higher order . from this viewpoint",
    ", it seems to us that it would be an asset that the vacuum energy obtained from any kind of calculation is at least negative .",
    "+   + in section 5 we present an optimized expansion in order to reduce the dependence on the choice of renormalization scheme to a single parameter @xmath37 , related to the coupling constant renormalization .",
    "this is achieved by exchanging the mass parameters by their renormalization scale and scheme invariant counterparts and by re - expanding the series in the one - loop coupling constant . for @xmath38 , which corresponds to the @xmath3 scheme , we find a positive @xmath4 , positive @xmath36 and hence negative @xmath30 .",
    "however , we find that a region of @xmath37 is existing in which the vacuum energy is negative , but unfortunately the dependence on @xmath37 in this region happens to be very large .",
    "a higher order analysis seems to be required to reach more definite conclusions about the sign of @xmath4 , @xmath36 or @xmath28 . +   + for the benefit of the reader , we provide in section 6 an overview of some important consequences stemming from the presence of the gribov and gluon mass parameters on the gluon and ghost propagators .",
    "we point out a particular renormalization property of the zwanziger action in order to ensure the enhancement of the ghost propagator .",
    "conclusions are written down in section 7 , while the technical details of our work have been collected in the appendices a and b.",
    "as explained in @xcite , the nonlocal functional @xmath15 can be localized by means of the introduction of a suitable set of additional ghost fields .",
    "more precisely , for the localized version of the measure @xmath19 we get , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is given by and @xmath41 . ]",
    "@xmath42 while @xmath43 the fields @xmath44 are a pair of complex conjugate bosonic fields .",
    "each field has @xmath45 components .",
    "similarly , the fields @xmath46 are anticommuting .",
    "the local action ( [ ll1 ] ) is renormalizable by power counting .",
    "more precisely , it has been shown in @xcite that the green functions obtained with the action @xmath47 with the insertion of the local composite operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 are renormalizable , the action @xmath47 being indeed renormalizable by a multiplicative renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath50 and of the fields @xcite .",
    "we remark that the action @xmath47 displays a global @xmath51 symmetry , @xmath52 , with respect to the composite index @xmath53 , of the additional fields @xmath54 . setting @xmath55",
    "we get @xmath56 for the @xmath51 invariance we have @xmath57 the presence of the global @xmath51 invariance means that one can make use of the composite index @xmath58 . by means of the diagonal operator @xmath59 , the @xmath60-valued fields turn out to possess an additional quantum number . as shown in @xcite , the action @xmath47 is left invariant by the following nilpotent brsttransformations , @xmath61 with @xmath62 for further use , the quantum numbers of all fields entering the action @xmath47 are displayed in table 1 .       to determine the solution @xmath63 which characterizes the vacuum , we should take that one which gives us the absolute minimum of the energy functional @xmath64 , which was shown in figure 3 .",
    "+   + as a final remark , we would like to notice that the same decomposition as in eq.([9b ] ) could also be useful for higher loop computations .",
    "the effective action @xmath64 will remain symmetric under the exchange of @xmath65 and @xmath66 and equations like ( [ coord3])-([coord4bis ] ) shall remain valid .",
    "this should facilitate at least a bit the two - loop evaluation of the effective action and gap equations .",
    "also , one does not need to evaluate any new anomalous dimension , since these are already known , either from previous calculations @xcite , or from exploiting relations like eq.([new21 ] ) .",
