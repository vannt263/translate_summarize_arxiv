    ".    recall that the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xmath11 with hurst index @xmath12 is a centered gaussian process with the covariance function @xmath13}=\\frac{1}2 \\bigl(t^{2h}+s^{2h}-{{\\vert}t - s{\\vert}}^{2h } \\bigr).\\ ] ]    from now on we suppose that the hurst indices in satisfy the inequality @xmath14 and we consider the continuous modifications of both processes , which exist due to the kolmogorov theorem .",
    "assuming that the hurst indices @xmath4 , @xmath5 and parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 are known , we aim to estimate the unknown drift parameter @xmath17 by the continuous observations of the trajectories of @xmath18 . due to the long - range dependence property of fbm with @xmath19 , we call our model the model with double long - range dependence .    in the case where @xmath20 , the problem of drift parameter estimation in the model was solved in @xcite , and in the case where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the estimator was constructed in @xcite",
    ". the goal of the present paper is to generalize the results from @xcite to arbitrary @xmath23 .",
    "the problem , more technical than principal , is that in the case where @xmath22 and @xmath24 , the construction of the estimator is reduced to the question if the solution of the fredholm integral equation of the 2nd kind with weakly singular kernel from @xmath25 $ ] exists and is unique , but for @xmath26 , the kernel does not belong to @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "moreover , in this case , we can say that in the literature it is impossible to pick up for this kernel any suitable standard techniques for working with weak singular kernels , and it does not belong to any standard class of weak singular kernels .",
    "the matter lies in the fact that the kernel contains two power indices , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and they create more complex singularity than it usually happens .",
    "so , it is necessary to make many additional efforts in order to prove the compactness of the corresponding integral operator . immediately after establishing the compactness of the corresponding integral operator",
    ", the problem of statistical estimation follows the same steps as in the paper @xcite , and we briefly present these steps for completeness .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we describe the model and explain how to reduce the solution of the estimation problem to the existence ",
    "uniqueness problem for the integral fredholm equation of the 2nd kind with some nonstandard weakly singular kernel . in section  [ sec3 ] , we solve the existence  uniqueness problem .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to the basic properties of estimator , that is , we establish its form , consistency , and asymptotic normality .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] contains the properties of hypergeometric function used in the proof of the existence ",
    "uniqueness result for the main fredhom integral equation .",
    "since we suppose that the hurst parameters @xmath27 and scale parameters @xmath28 are known , for technical simplicity , we consider the case where @xmath29 and , as it was mentioned before , @xmath30 . if we wish to include the unknown parameter @xmath17 into the fractional brownian motion with the smallest hurst parameter in order to apply girsanov s theorem for construction of the estimator , we consider a couple of processes @xmath31 , @xmath32 defined on the space @xmath33 and let @xmath34 be a probability measure under which @xmath35 and @xmath3 are independent , @xmath3 is a fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath5 , and @xmath35 is a fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath4 and drift @xmath36 , that is , @xmath37    the probability measure @xmath38 corresponds to the case @xmath39 .",
    "our main problem is the construction of maximum likelihood estimator for @xmath0 by the observations of the process @xmath40.$ ] as in @xcite , we apply to @xmath41 the linear transformation in order to reduce the construction to the sum with one term being the wiener process .",
    "so , we take the kernel @xmath42 and construct the integral @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the beta function , and @xmath45 is a  gaussian martingale ( molchan martingale ) , admitting the representations @xmath46 with @xmath47 and a wiener process @xmath48 . according to @xcite , the linear transformation is well defined , and the processes @xmath41 and @xmath49 are observed simultaneously .",
    "this means that we can reduce the original problem to the equivalent problem of the construction of maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath0 basing on the linear transformation  @xmath49 . for simplicity , denote @xmath50 . now",
    "the main problem can be formulated as follows .",
