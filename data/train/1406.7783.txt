    "type iin supernovae ( sne iin ) are a class of sne in which the signatures of the interaction between the sn ejecta and the circumstellar medium are observed @xcite .",
    "the estimated circumstellar density required to explain the observational properties is much higher than that expected from the standard stellar evolution theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally assumed that the high circumstellar density is due to the high mass - loss rates of the sn iin progenitors .",
    "the estimated mass - loss rates are typically higher than @xmath2 @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sne iin are heterogeneous .",
    "for example , their peak luminosities spread in more than two orders of magnitudes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the diversities can be caused by many reasons , e.g. , the diversities in circumstellar density , sn ejecta mass , and sn ejecta energy .",
    "it is important to understand which observational properties are affected by which physical parameters . by disentangling the origins of the observational diversities , we can constrain the physical properties of the progenitor systems and obtain the better understanding of sne iin and their progenitors .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate a way to disentangle the information on the wind density , sn ejecta energy , and sn ejecta mass based on the early light curves ( lcs ) of sne iin .",
    "we suggest that the wind and sn properties can be constrained independently if both the rise time and the peak luminosity of a sn iin are observed . by using the observational rise times and peak luminosities of sne iin recently reported by @xcite",
    ", we show how diverse the wind and sn properties should be to explain the observational diversities of sne iin .",
    "@xcite also performed a similar analysis by using their data mainly focusing on the rise times when they reported the observations .",
    "however , they did not use the peak luminosities to constrain the sn properties .",
    "in addition , they assumed that the shock breakout always occurs in the dense wind in sne iin .",
    "the shock breakout does not necessarily occur in the wind even if it is optically thick and makes sne iin . here , we also investigate the case in which the shock breakout does not occur in the wind .",
    "we analytically estimate the diffusion time @xmath4 and the characteristic luminosity @xmath5 of sne iin at @xmath4 based on the way presented by @xcite .",
    "the diffusion time @xmath4 is estimated as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the speed of light , @xmath8 is the thomson scattering optical depth of the wind from the radius @xmath9 where photons start to be emitted in the wind , @xmath10 is the length between @xmath9 and the radius where the wind optical depth becomes unity ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "assuming that the wind radius and @xmath17 is much larger than @xmath9 , the diffusion time is expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is opacity and assumed to be 0.34 @xmath20 below .",
    "@xmath9 differs depending on whether the shock breakout occurs in the wind or not .",
    "we derive @xmath4 in the two cases separately .",

    "the shock breakout occurs at @xmath26 using the power - law formula presented in @xcite @xmath27 to estimate the shock radius at @xmath28 which is @xmath9 , we obtain the diffusion time @xmath4 for the case of the shock breakout in the dense wind @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the kinetic energy of the sn ejecta and @xmath31 is the mass of the sn ejecta ( see table [ tabletd ] )",

    "@xmath36 and the diffusion time in the wind is @xmath37 for example , when @xmath38 @xmath3 and @xmath39 @xmath40 , the total wind optical depth does not exceed @xmath41 if @xmath42 cm with the standard @xmath43 .",
    "it is possible that the progenitor radius is larger than @xmath44 cm @xmath45 and the wind does not become optically thick enough to cause the shock breakout in it . this dividing radius is less than those of red supergiants ( rsgs ) and luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) @xmath46 .",
    "even if the progenitor radius is smaller than @xmath44 cm , it is possible that the dense wind does not start just above the progenitor and there exist a void between the progenitor and the dense part of the wind .",
