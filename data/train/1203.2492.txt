    "several physical systems reproduce certain properties of astrophysical objects like black holes : they exhibit an effective curved space - time when a wave propagates in a `` moving '' medium  @xcite .",
    "examples can be found in acoustics , dielectrics , optical fibres , micro - wave guides , bose - einstein condensates , superfluids , ion traps ... starting with the seminal works of white  @xcite , anderson & spiegel  @xcite , moncrief  @xcite and unruh  @xcite , there has been a growing interest for such analogue models of gravity in order to simulate and understand the physics of wave propagation on a curved space - time .",
    "the case of interface and surface waves was initiated by schtzhold & unruh , who derived the equation of propagation of long gravity waves moving on a background flow in terms of a general relativistic metric  @xcite . a black hole , or its time - inverse : a white hole , can indeed be mimicked by the interaction between interfacial waves and a liquid current  @xcite .",
    "just like the expected behaviour of light near the event horizon of a black hole , gravity waves can not escape a hydrodynamic black hole featuring a trapping line caused by the velocity gradient of a sufficiently strong background flow .",
    "in hydrodynamic experiments , it is usually more convenient to simulate a white hole",
    ". then , gravity waves can not enter a hydrodynamic white hole featuring a blocking line .    in a previous series of experiments ,",
    "such an artificial white hole was created and observed in a laboratory , using water waves in the presence of a counter - flow inside a wave - tank with varying bottom profile  @xcite . here",
    ", we provide a status report on a new series of ongoing experiments , in which we study the behaviour of surface waves of various frequencies in the gravity and gravity - capillary regime in the presence of such white - hole horizons .",
    "we encounter a good qualitative agreement with the theory developed in  @xcite , and interpret the interesting quantitative differences .",
    "we are in particular interested in the following key points of the theory of gravity - capillary surface waves .",
    "when including surface tension , a second and third horizon appear on top of the white - hole horizon for gravity waves : a `` blue '' horizon associated to mode - converted blue - shifted waves , and a `` negative '' horizon .",
    "this negative horizon is associated to the appearance of negative - energy waves  @xcite ( recently observed in a similar setup  @xcite ) , an essential feature of hawking radiation ( the quantum glow of super - massive objects ) . the blue horizon can interact and even merge with the white horizon providing two scenarios in order to escape an artificial black hole .",
    "one scenario , consisting of a double bounce with mode conversion , was experimentally discovered nearly three decades ago by badulin et al .",
    "@xcite , and interpreted in terms of the black / white - hole analogy in @xcite .",
    "the other scenario is novel and consists of a direct dispersive penetration across the white - hole horizon .",
    "we have observed strong indications to validate this second scenario , and hope to confirm these quantitatively in the near future .",
    "this would establish that one can enter into the ( normally forbidden ) white - hole region by sending high - frequency capillary waves .",
    "these are not blocked at the primary white - hole horizon , contrarily to the low - frequency gravity waves , nor even at higher counter - flow velocities .. ] indeed , the horizon completely disappears above a certain frequency due to the merging and consequent disappearance of the blue and white horizons .",
    "these scenarios are not limited to hydrodynamic models , but are generic consequences of the dispersive properties beyond the relativistic regime .",
    "a double - bouncing scenario is possible in any system where `` subluminal '' dispersion ( group velocity @xmath0 decreasing with the wave number @xmath1 ) at intermediate wavenumbers @xmath1 gives place to `` superluminal '' dispersion ( @xmath0 increasing with @xmath1 ) at higher @xmath1 .",
    "this latter condition ( superluminal high-@xmath1 dispersion , irrespective of the behaviour at intermediate @xmath1 ) alone is sufficient for direct dispersive penetration .",
    "water waves in the presence of a uniform current are described by the dispersion relation  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the frequency of the wave in the rest frame and @xmath1 the wavenumber ; @xmath4 denotes the gravitational acceleration at the water surface , @xmath5 the fluid density , @xmath6 the surface tension , @xmath7 the constant velocity of the background flow and @xmath8 the water depth . for water , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the flow induces a doppler shift of the pulsation @xmath11 .",
    "the relativistic regime with its schwarzschild - like metric corresponds to the shallow - water limit ( @xmath12 ) of gravity - wave propagation  @xcite : @xmath13 , with the relativistic `` invariant '' speed @xmath14 .",
    "an analogue black / white - hole horizon will then appear when @xmath15 .",
    "but the concept of horizon can easily be generalized to any location where the group velocity @xmath16 vanishes .",
    "the shallow - water limit @xmath12 can be realized for example in the circular hydraulic jump , which spontaneously forms a hydrodynamic white hole  @xcite . in wave - channel experiments ,",
    "both the shallow - water and the deep - water limits can be probed , depending on the setup .",
    "interaction with a counter - current will lead to a blueshifting of the incident waves : @xmath1 increases .",
    "but variations of the counter - current flow rate are typically achieved by a variation of @xmath8 ( e.g. through the immersion of a bump ) .",
    "these two effects compete and various @xmath17 regimes can in principle be realised . at sufficiently high wavenumbers @xmath1 ,",
    "small - scale dispersive corrections appear due to capillarity , which will turn out to be crucial to cross a horizon . since this is our main object of study , we will from now on focus on the deep - water limit ( @xmath18 ) , and start again from long - wavelength gravity waves , proceeding step by step towards higher @xmath1 .",
    "when a gravity wave meets a counter - current , the incident wavelength diminishes and the wave height increases  @xcite . according to the ray theory ,",
    "the wave amplitude would diverge when blocking occurs .",
    "however , such caustic for the energy is avoided by a regularization process . due to the velocity gradient ,",
    "the incoming waves are somewhat diffracted before being stopped at the blocking point , where @xmath0 changes sign and the waves are reflected .",
    "blue - shifted modes are therefore created through a process of mode conversion at the blocking point .",
    "since the incident and blue - shifted waves have the same wavenumber at the blocking point , they interfere and a spatial resonance appears .",
    "the diffraction implies that the figure of interference is not a simple standing wave . in the deep - water limit valid for our experiments",
    ", an airy interferences pattern appears  @xcite .",
    "the blocking point itself is a saddle - node or tangent bifurcation  @xcite : it marks the point where the two real solutions disappear .    when including surface tension  @xcite , the deep - water ( @xmath18 ) dispersion relation becomes @xmath19 or @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the capillary length ( @xmath22 mm for water ) .",
    "the gravity waves are still blocked , with the blocking velocity for pure gravity waves ( @xmath23 ) given by @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the period .",
    "moreover , the blue - shifted waves are also stopped at a new blocking point on their backward drift ( group velocity @xmath26 , along with the background flow @xmath27 , although the phase velocity @xmath28 ) . the capillary asymptotic limit for the blocking velocity of these blue - shifted waves is @xmath29  @xcite . at this second blocking point ,",
    "the blue - shifted wave merges with a new capillary solution , which appears ( again through mode conversion , see fig .",
    "[ fig : disp - rel ] ) at this secondary turning point .",
    "the capillary waves propagate in the same direction as the original incident gravity waves .",
    "these newly created capillary waves are not blocked by the primary saddle - node line but go through the gravity horizon  @xcite .",
    "badulin et al .  observed experimentally that gravity waves can undergo such double bouncing behaviour followed by conversion to capillary waves which propagate into the forbidden region , and finally vanish by viscous damping  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : disp - rel ] illustrates the process .",
    "( the curves rotate clockwise with increasing @xmath30 ) , plotted in the form @xmath31 .",
    "the group velocity @xmath32 corresponds to the slope of the green / blue curves ( green : positive co - moving frequency @xmath33 , blue : negative @xmath34 ) , and horizons are characterized by local minima / maxima .",
    "the double - bouncing observed by badulin  @xcite corresponds to the dashed red line ( see also  @xcite).,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    in the context of the black hole analogy , when time - reversing these observations , one concludes that incident long - wavelength gravity waves can not escape from a trapping region ( black hole ) unless they are converted into the capillary range .",
    "the second escape route consists of creating incident waves from the start in the capillary range .",
    "the horizon completely disappears below some critical period @xmath35 , determined by the cusp formed through the interaction of the white and blue horizons .",
    "waves with @xmath36 can then propagate straight ahead , avoiding any horizons , and enter the `` forbidden '' region ( or escape from the trapping region ) .",
    "the cusp can clearly be identified graphically from the ( @xmath37 vs @xmath38 ) phase diagram for deep - water waves ( @xmath18 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , where @xmath37 represents any critical or blocking velocity .",
    "the theoretical phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] was derived in  @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall the main steps in its derivation .",
    "we start from the cubic dispersion relation   for water waves : @xmath39 , where we have taken @xmath40 .",
    "a double root @xmath41 of this cubic equation , characteristic of a saddle - node point ( and hence a horizon or turning point ) , is such that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the remaining simple root .",
    "after some straightforward but tedious algebra , this constraint leads to a quintic equation for the critical velocity @xmath37 , corresponding to all possible resonances ( for @xmath40 ) : @xmath44=0\\ ] ] a dual quintic is obtained for @xmath45 by reversing the velocity @xmath46 .",
    "using this quintic , one can numerically compute and plot the velocity for saddle - node bifurcations or blocking points as a function of the period of the incident waves , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] .",
    "here we are mainly concerned with the gravity - wave blocking speed @xmath47 and the blocking speed for blue - shifted waves ( of which @xmath48 is the asymptotic limit as @xmath49 ) , but we note that there also exists a blocking line for the negative - frequency waves  @xcite .",
    "the well - known result @xmath50 in the gravity - wave limit immediately follows from eq .   when setting @xmath23 ( or @xmath51 ) .",
    "the asymptotic capillary limit @xmath52 is likewise obtained for @xmath53 . from eq .",
    ", several analytic approximations can also be obtained .",
    "for example , to find an approximate expression for the blue horizon ( the blocking of blue - shifted waves ) , we keep the terms up to first order in @xmath11 and introduce the perturbative development @xmath54 in order to write : @xmath55 solving for @xmath56 , using @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath58 or @xmath59 note that an identical computation for the negative quintic leads to a simple change of sign in the second term : to first order , the negative - frequency blocking line has the same departure ( but in opposite direction ) from the capillary asymptotic limit as the blue horizon ( for @xmath60 ) .     versus wave period @xmath38 .",
    "the blocking curves @xmath37 are marked in thick black lines .",
    "the white - hole horizon ( corresponding to the gravity - wave blocking curve @xmath47thick red line  when @xmath23 ) intersects the blue horizon or blocking curve for the blueshifted waves ( the lowest thick black line , which asymptotes to @xmath48 from below ) and creates a cusp @xmath61 below which both horizons disappear . note that there also exists a blocking line for the negative - frequency waves , which intersects @xmath47 at @xmath62 and also asymptotes to @xmath48 ( from above ) .",

    "theory , we anticipate a so - called pitchfork bifurcation  @xcite : the merging of two saddle - node bifurcations is equivalent to the appearance of a fictive symmetry in the representation space of the cubic - in-@xmath1 equation  .",
    "the resulting pitchfork bifurcation is then associated with the breaking of this symmetry , which is absent from the original system . in other words , below @xmath35 , the blocking lines or horizons corresponding to both saddle - node bifurcations completely disappear .",
    "note that the cusp is analogous to a critical point ( second - order phase transition ) in a thermodynamical phase diagram ( fig .",

    "the vertical line @xmath68 roughly separates the capillary ( @xmath36 ) and the gravity ( @xmath69 ) regimes .",

    "the saddle - node line ending on @xmath74 ( critical point ) and @xmath48 ( tricritical point at infinity ) corresponds to the threshold for the simultaneous appearance of blue - shifted waves and capillary waves propagating in the same direction as the incident ones ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the @xmath76 and @xmath77 phases are characterized by the presence of negative energy waves . in the @xmath77 phase",
    ", these negative energy waves are of the gravity and capillary type and propagate in the same direction as the counter - flow .",

    "the dispersion relation   can be approximated by @xmath138 the condition @xmath139 for wave blocking becomes @xmath140 in the limit @xmath141 , the blocking wavenumber @xmath142 ( corresponding to @xmath50 ) gives @xmath143 . inserting this value in the previous expression leads to @xmath144 for @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "non - linear effects could also play an important role , in spite of our attempts to limit them by working with small amplitudes .",
    "we limit ourselves to two comments .",
    "first , the finite wave amplitude @xmath70 increases the blocking velocity .",
    "this well - known ( but poorly understood ) phenomenon  @xcite can to a first approximation be modelled as an effective surface tension ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath147 ( for pure gravity waves in the absence of a counter - current ) . since @xmath148 in our experiments",
    ", it is clear that the finite amplitude has a much stronger influence on the blocking velocity than the intrinsic surface tension , and is perhaps the main contributor to the difference between @xmath123 and @xmath133 .",
    "this illustrates the importance of generating waves with a low factor @xmath149 ( @xmath150 at @xmath136s in our current setup ) . a second non - linear effect which plays an important role in certain other wave - blocking experiments",
    "@xcite is the benjamin - feir instability , which leads to the appearance of so - called side - bands ( excitations at frequencies slightly different from the fundamental one ) .",
    "however , we have verified conservation of period in our experiments , thereby nearly excluding this possibility .",
    "we believe the above elements to provide a reasonable explanation for the apparent mismatch between @xmath98 and @xmath99 . it should be noted that this mismatch is well known in the fluid - mechanics community , but not well understood .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite also observe the blocking of @xmath136s waves at a countercurrent velocity @xmath98 , but do not attempt to interpret this discrepancy with the theoretical prediction .",
    "also note that similar arguments would apply to the case of the gravity - capillary waves at @xmath92 .",
    "there , however , the additional appearance of a transversal instability mentioned above further complicates matters and further experiments are required to clarify the situation .",
    "it is remarkable that the airy interference hybridizes the character of the incoming wave .",
    "a hybrid is created between the original wave ( through the period @xmath38 , in the expression   of the stopping length @xmath115 ) and the background flow ( through @xmath151 ) . in our experiment , we are sending continuous wave - trains .",
    "if one were to send wave - packets ( `` particles '' , i.e. : superpositions of waves ) , then these would be deformed into superpositions of wave - flow hybrids , or `` hybridons '' . as a matter of fact",
    ", we can take this observation further . the airy stopping length",
    "obeys @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the wavelength at blocking , and @xmath154 the dimensionless `` unruh '' number @xmath155 obtained from the two characteristic `` frequencies '' at blocking : the wave frequency @xmath11 and the flow gradient @xmath151 .",
    "this leads to the following interpretation .",
    "dispersion has a double role in the near - horizon physics .",
    "it keeps the wavenumber finite ( i.e. , it solves the trans - planckian problem  see next section ) , thereby avoiding the first relativistic ray - theory pathology .",
    "second , it creates an interference mechanism which hybridizes this wavelength with the background flow by modulating it through @xmath154 .",
    "dispersion thus replaces the wavelength by a characteristic interference length @xmath115 .",
    "this mechanism of interferences allows to solve the second pathology associated to the ray theory : the infinite amplitude at the blocking point .",
    "indeed , when @xmath156 , i.e.  when the frequency of the wave is large compared to the spatial variation of the background flow velocity , then the wkb - approximation is valid . note that @xmath156 also leads to @xmath157 and therefore to negligible hawking radiation . near the blocking point , though , one always has @xmath158 .",
    "the wkb approximation then breaks down , and two resonance mechanisms come into play .",
    "the first one ( airy interference ) is an adiabatic process and the second one ( hawking radiation ) is a non - adiabatic process , see the chapter on `` the basics of water waves theory for analogue gravity '' elsewhere in this volume .    as a final note ,",
    "we should point out that we have neglected the presence of a zero mode in our considerations on the airy mechanism .",
    "such a zero mode ( an @xmath159 solution to the dispersion relation , or superposition of various such solutions ) would deform the free surface and complicate the interference pattern , see  @xcite and the discussion in the chapter `` the cerenkov effect revisited : from swimming ducks to zero modes in gravitational analogs '' elsewhere in this volume .",
    "this omission is justified since in the regime @xmath18 one can minimize the amplitude of the zero mode by working at low velocities and limiting the slope of the bump . note that @xmath160 implies the existence of a threshold @xmath161 for the appearance of a zero mode , contrarily to the pure gravity case",
    "our experimental results to corroborate the theory developed in  @xcite have been slightly marred by the appearance of a transversal instability , which we hope to remedy using a narrower wave - channel .",
    "nevertheless , there is little doubt that capillary waves can penetrate through a gravity - wave blocking line .",
    "the full strength of this statement becomes clear in the context of the gravitational analogy .",
    "the surface tension constitutes a high-@xmath1 dispersive correction to the low-@xmath1 gravity - wave theory .",
    "such dispersive corrections can therefore completely alter the properties of a horizon : dispersive horizons are no longer one - way membranes , and the infinite blueshifting associated with strictly relativistic horizons disappears .",
    "the example of surface waves shows that this statement can be true even if the dispersion is ( initially ) subluminal .",
    "the idea that dispersive corrections could solve the trans - planckian problem of gravity has from the start been one of the cornerstones of the analogue gravity programme  @xcite .",
    "most work has historically focused on the study of subluminal ( `` normal '' ) dispersion .",
    "this seems curious in the light of the following observations . in the pure gravity - wave ( subluminal ) regime , the trans - planckian problem",
    "is indeed avoided for the incident wave : it is mode - converted into a blue - shifted wave and the wave bounces away from the horizon ( in terms of the group velocity ; the phase velocity is still directed towards the white hole ) .",
    "however , as this blue - shifted wave approaches `` flat space - time '' ( i.e. , as the counter - current velocity @xmath162 ) , a new , secondary trans - planckian problem arises : the wavenumber of the blue - shifted wave @xmath163 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : secondary - transplanckian ] .",
    "this was observed earlier  @xcite with respect to unruh s original subluminal model  @xcite , and related problems with other subluminal models were also discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the same secondary trans - planckian problem occurs for the negative - frequency waves associated to a hawking - like process .",
    "actually , even without invoking any horizon effects , a similar problem arises : any counter - current , no matter how small , would allow for the existence of both blue - shifted and negative - energy waves with infinitely small wavelengths .",
    "purely subluminal dispersion would then solve the primary trans - planckian problem associated to the horizon , at the cost of creating a new one in flat space - time .",
    "( dashed red line ) , a blue - shifted wave @xmath164 is created from the incident wave @xmath165 through mode conversion at the blocking line @xmath166 .",
    "since @xmath164 has @xmath26 , it moves away from the horizon towards lower @xmath30 . as @xmath162 , @xmath163 , leading to a secondary trans - planckian problem in flat space - time.,width=377 ]    more complicated dispersion relations , e.g.  as in helium - ii ( superfluid @xmath167he ) , which has a `` roton '' minimum in the @xmath168vs@xmath169 diagram , could overcome this problem by letting the outgoing blue - shifted wave decay at the end of the quasiparticle spectrum into two rotons , with the same total energy and momentum ( i.e. , @xmath170 )  @xcite . the secondary trans - planckian problem is then avoided because the dispersion curve ends in such a two - roton decay channel.he-like dispersion model seriously for true gravity , this could lead to the creation of a photon condensate near a white hole , or vice versa : outgoing particles from a black hole might originate from a condensate in curved spacetime .",
    "although such a scenario might not be as crazy as it sounds  @xcite , we will not pursue this exotic line of thought further here , and stick to `` simpler '' solutions of the trans - planckian problem . ]    another obvious way of resolving the secondary trans - planckian problem with subluminal dispersion is through dissipation , for example due to viscosity .",
    "note that viscosity , apart from leading to dissipation , necessarily also introduces dispersion  @xcite .",
    "dissipation in media is quite generic , often unavoidable ( as in optical media , where dissipation and dispersion are coupled through the kramers - kronig relations ) , and might be relevant for our `` fundamental '' space - time as well .",
    "actually , from a theoretical qft point of view , lorentz symmetry violation is automatically accompanied by dissipation under quite general assumptions , and dissipative effects should therefore in principle be treated together with dispersive ones  @xcite .",
    "however , dissipation is formally much harder to treat than dispersion , and it has received little attention in the context of ( analogue ) gravity . also , the relevance of dissipation obviously depends on its characteristic scale . here",
    ", we mainly wish to stress that the secondary trans - planckian problem in surface waves is solved through dispersion before dissipation becomes relevant .",
    "these observations suggest a more general interpretation for our results with water waves .",
    "the mesoscopic scale of surface tension `` saves '' the fluid continuum approximation from breaking down in the presence of a counter - current : the capillary behaviour at high @xmath1 is essential in order to avoid a trans - planckian pathology .",
    "we therefore expect that any system displaying analogue gravity behaviour at low @xmath1 through propagation on a moving background medium will necessarily have superluminal dispersion at sufficiently high @xmath1 s , unless dissipation kills the whole phenomenon before such scales are actually reached",
    ". the exotic case of helium - ii mentioned above might be the exception that confirms the rule , since even then , the dispersion relation is superluminal for a certain range of high wavenumbers beyond the roton minimum .",
    "moreover , we can establish the following general rules .",
    "if the first corrections at intermediate @xmath1 are subluminal , followed by superluminal corrections at high @xmath1 , as in the case of deep - water waves , then there will always be a white horizon and a blue horizon , leading to the possibility of a badulin - type double - bouncing scenario .",
    "there will then also always exist some counter - current velocity @xmath74 for which these white and blue saddle - node points merge into a pitchfork bifurcation and both horizons disappear , allowing for direct dispersive penetration .",
    "such direct dispersive penetration is actually even more universal : it suffices to have a superluminal correction at high @xmath1 to a relativistic low-@xmath1 behaviour , irrespective of the intermediate regime .",
    "this is true , e.g. , for phonons in becs  @xcite , just like for capillary surface waves : sufficiently blueshifted ( `` superblueshifted '' ) modes will always be able to penetrate through any counter - flow barrier , unless dissipation prevents such superblueshifting .",
    "the case of surface waves is in a sense richer than that of bec - phonons , in that there is a true blocking line for low - frequency gravity waves , which can not directly penetrate the horizon . for becs",
    ", the absence of an intermediate subluminal correction implies that even low - frequency phonons can in principle superblueshift and cross the horizon directly .",
    "finally , in spite of our several comments regarding dissipation , it seems that both horizon - crossing scenarios can indeed be fully realized for surface waves before being dissipated .    to sum up , to enter a white hole  or , by time - inversion : to escape a black hole ",
    "one has to either tune the period to be subcritical , or bounce on two horizons .",
    "the bottom line is of course what this teaches us for real gravity .",
    "here the issue is more complicated , because extrapolation from the current state of observations has so far not given any evidence for dispersion ( or dissipation ) even at the planck scale .",
    "other complications might also arise which are peculiar to real gravity .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it was shown using a simple toy model that superluminal dispersion would render gravitational black holes strongly unstable , due to the leaking of resonant modes . in any case , we may conclude that , if dispersion is indeed relevant in gravity ( possibly even far beyond the planck scale ) , then subluminal dispersion alone would most certainly not be sufficient to solve the trans - planckian problem .",
    "smith was the first to derive the airy equation in 1975 by performing an asymptotic expansion of the water - wave equations ( euler equations + continuity equation + boundary conditions ) close to the caustic  @xcite .",
    "he inferred the so - called amplitude equation which is a nonlinear schrdinger equation with a term proportional to the distance to the caustic .",
    "when the cubic term is negligible , the amplitude equation reduces to the airy equation .      in 1977 ,",
    "basovich & talanov  @xcite provided another derivation of the airy equation by noticing that @xmath172 at the blocking point .",
    "taylor - expanding the function @xmath173 close to its parabolic minimum and the function @xmath174 close to the stopping point @xmath117 and taking the inverse fourier transformation , they deduced the airy function and the associated stopping length : @xmath175    in 1979 , peregrine & smith  @xcite used an operator expansion method : the idea is to inverse fourier - transform a truncated series expansion of the dispersion relation written in the form @xmath176 .",
    "again , the cubic schrdinger equation with a spatial term was derived with another expression for the stopping length : @xmath177 where the subscripts mean partial derivative and the derivatives are taken at the blocking line .",
    "the method was generalized in 2004 by suastika  @xcite to include viscous dissipation and wave breaking . in 2003 , lavrenov  @xcite applied a saddle - point method to the maslov integral representation of the uniform wave field asymptotics in the vicinity of the blocking line .",
    "he found : @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the dispersion relation function and the derivatives are taken at the caustic .",
    "we write the background flow velocity near the critical value @xmath180 as a function of @xmath120 and @xmath1 , and develop both to lowest non - zero order around the stopping length : @xmath181 equating both into @xmath182 and making the substitution @xmath183 immediately leads to the airy differential equation @xmath184 where @xmath185 , with @xmath186 .",
    "thus , @xmath187 is an airy function @xmath188 and @xmath189 is the airy stopping length , which depends both on the incident wave and the background flow : it scales with the period @xmath38 of the incident wave as @xmath190 and with the background flow acceleration as @xmath191 . a straightforward dimensional analysis ( @xmath192 )",
    "would only lead to @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "note that airy interference requires the flow gradient to remain approximately constant over the characteristic length of the interference process .",
    "this can easily be seen in our derivation : eq .",
    "is only a good approximation if @xmath195 for @xmath196 . in our experiments , @xmath151 is a constant on the whole linear slope of the bump where the horizon @xmath117 is located , so we do not need to worry about this issue .",
