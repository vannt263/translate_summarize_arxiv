    "microtubules are important structural components of the cytoskeleton , which play a vital role in many processes in a living cell .",
    "their unique ability of rapid growth and even more rapid shrinking ( often called dynamical instability ) is exploited by the nature to segregate chromosomes during cell division , and as such microtubules have been the subject of intensive study . at the same time , the high complexity of the involved processes turns experimental study of microtubules into a challenging task , with many key questions in the area remaining unanswered .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "the authors suggested a simplified stochastic model of microtubule growth aimed at deriving the dynamical instability from the interplay of a small number of parameters ( the actual behaviour of microtubules is much more complex , see e.g.  review @xcite and references there ) .",
    "mathematically , the model represents microtubules as long polymers made from two types of monomers , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( guanosin triphosphate ( gtp@xmath2 ) and guanosin diphosphate ( gdp@xmath3 ) tubulin complexes ) , subject to several stochastic transformations occurring with fixed rates , namely : growth , i.e. , attachment of @xmath0  monomers to the active end ( with the rate depending on the type of the extremal monomer ) , hydrolysis , i.e. , irreversible transformation of a @xmath0  monomer into a @xmath1  monomer ( independently of the state of all other monomers composing the microtubule ) , and depolymerisation / shrinking , i.e. , spontaneous departure of the hydrolysed extreme monomer ( for a formal definition , see sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] below ) .",
    "the authors described analytically the limiting behaviour of the model in several particular cases but had to rely upon numerical simulations in `` the more biologically relevant case of intermediate parameter values ''  @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to describe the phase diagram of this model , in particular , to give several equivalent characterisations of the phase boundary , the set in the parameter space separating the region of the unbounded growth of microtubules from that of the `` compact phase '' , where the average microtubule length remains bounded . according to one of our main results ( for a complete list and rigorous statements ,",
    "see sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] below ) , for every point in the parameter space ( i.e. , a collection of fixed rates ) there is a well defined value of velocity of the position of microtubule s active end , and it is the zero - velocity set in the parameter space which separates the regions of unbounded growth ( positive velocity ) from that of `` compact phase '' ( negative velocity ) .      following @xcite , we think of microtubules @xmath4 as of long polymers consisting of @xmath0  and @xmath1  monomers , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 for all @xmath7 , with the `` extreme '' monomer @xmath8 located at the _ active _ end of the microtubule .",
    "initially all monomers are in the @xmath1  state , and the time evolution of the microtubule ( formally described below ) guarantees that with probability one at every moment of time the microtubule contains at most a finite number of @xmath0  monomers ; it is thus convenient to describe the current state of a microtubule at time @xmath9 in terms of the position @xmath10 of the extreme monomer @xmath8 and the head ( or the populated zone , @xcite ) @xmath11 of the microtubule , defined as the _ shortest _ word @xmath12 such that all other monomers @xmath13 , @xmath14 , are in the @xmath1  state .",
    "since attachment of new monomers occurs at the active end of a microtubule , every non - empty head @xmath11 spans between the active end of the microtubule and its left - most @xmath0  monomer .",
    "let @xmath15 be a two - symbol alphabet , and let @xmath16 denote the collection of all possible finite words , including the empty one .",
    "we call a head any word belonging to the set @xmath17 so that every non - empty head @xmath18 can be written as a finite word @xmath19 for some integer @xmath7 with its left - most monomer being in the @xmath0  state , @xmath20 ( here and below , if @xmath21 and @xmath22 are two finite words in @xmath23 , we write @xmath24 for the concatenated word @xmath25 of @xmath26 symbols ) .",
