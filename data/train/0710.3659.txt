    "determining the distribution of extragalactic objects is one of the most important problems of modern cosmology , because they are the only tracers of the dark matter , except anisotropy of the cmb , that helps us to realize the matter distribution on the redshifts of about 1000 .",
    "unfortunately even in the local universe it is difficult to see the most faint galaxies , and when we go farther to larger redshifts , the most part of objects we can observe there with the modern ground - based telescopes used for large surveys are quasars as the most luminous objects .",
    "the matter distribution that we could reconstruct with the help of quasars is just like a light sketch , but it is all we have for today .",
    "the quasars are nonuniform objects : they have various luminosities and are on the different stages of their evolution .",
    "thus the reasonable question arises : how their clustering could depend on their physical properties , for example on their luminosity ? according to different numerical simulations of galaxy mergers that incorporate black hole growth , this dependence has to exist because more luminous quasars are considered to be born in denser environment . in the main part of such models ,",
    "in which the host halo mass correlates with the instantaneous luminosity of the quasars ( see e.g. @xcite ) , there should be a strong luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering . in the other type of such models , in which the host halo mass correlates with the peak luminosity of quasars , the luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering should be weaker",
    "because all of the quasars we see now , are considered to be similar objects but on different stages of their evolution ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is worth to note , that the redshift distribution of the quasars is not the same for different luminosities due to possible evolution effects .",
    "the largest quasar surveys are 2df and sdss .",
    "in contrast to 2df , which is finished for today and has 2qz catalogue as a result @xcite , sdss @xcite is in progress and the area covered by it is increasing . only a part of objects primarily classified as quasars were justified by spectra analysis and were included into sdss quasar catalogue iv @xcite .",
    "however even photometric classification of quasars with color diagrams @xcite is sufficient for using these objects for statistical purposes @xcite .    some attempts to find luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering",
    "have been made with different samples .",
    "e.g. adelberg & steidel @xcite , who worked with their own survey , pointed to luminosity independent quasar clustering .",
    "2df - team , that studied 2qz survey and found the little redshift evolution in the amplitude of the power spectrum @xcite , @xcite and significant increase in clustering amplitude at high redshifts @xcite , detected only marginal evidence for quasars with brighter apparent magnitudes to have a stronger clustering amplitude @xcite .",
    "porciani and norberg @xcite also found weak luminosity dependence of the clustering in 2qz survey .",
    "furthermore they noted that samples with different redshifts show different trends in luminosity dependence : in the redshift bin @xmath0 the brightest quasars seem to be more clustered ( have larger bias parameter ) ; in the redshift bin @xmath1 the bias parameter seems to follow a u - shape ; and the low redshift bin ( @xmath2 ) does not show any particular trend .",
    "myers et al .",
    "@xcite , working with @xmath3300,000 photometrically classified quasars from the 4th data release of the sdss , detected no significant luminosity dependence and pointed out that a 3@xmath4 detection of such effect requires a sample several times larger .    the present work deals with the study of the luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering for quasars from the fifth data release of sdss .",
    "the sample and its peculiarities are described in section 2 .",
    "the results of estimation of the correlation length as a function of luminosity are presented in section 3 . as we do not have such large sample , which we need , according to myers et al .",
    "@xcite , for precise measurements of the correlation function , we used another technique , which is described in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 is dedicated to discussion of obtained results .",
    ".the samples used for both methods .",
    "n is the number of objects for all given redshift interval ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xmath6 is effective absolute magnitude , @xmath7 is the number of objects with luminosity within given range ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 is the mean redshift . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here the errors were calculated in the following way .",
    "we obtain the initial values of the parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , find the deviations of experimental data from the theoretical one , construct random new experimental data using normal distribution and treating the theoretical values as mean values and obtained deviations as dispersions .",
    "we generated 100 of such sets of experimental data , found the parameters for each set , and then find the mean values of these parameters and their rms , which are presented in the table 2 .",
    "as one can see , we can not speak about any significant trend from these results .",
    "some variations of the both parameters are present .",
    "e.g. for second and forth z intervals on the scales @xmath12 mpc the correlation length is smaller for brighter quasars . on all the scales for third and fifth z intervals luminosity dependence of the correlation length",
    "seems to follow u - shape , which was found by porciani & norberg @xcite .",
    "but all these differences along with variations of @xmath11 are significant only on 1@xmath4 level .",
    "thus for varification of these results another another technique , which does not require very big samples was proposed in the next section .",
    "the second method lies in direct estimation of a part of quasars with given luminosity which reside in environment with larger quasar density . for the initial sample s1 consider a subsample s2 of quasars having the absolute magnitude @xmath8 from a given interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the number of quasars in subsample s2 is equal to @xmath14 . for",
    "any quasar from s2 we are looking for the nearest neighbours from s1 with any @xmath8 at the distance less than r. let @xmath15 be a number of quasars from s2 with @xmath13 $ ] having the distance to the nearest neighbour from s2 less then r. consider the following function @xmath16 if we fix the value of r , this function is an estimate of the portion of quasars with given luminosity , having the nearest neighbour distance less r , that could be an estimate of the portion of quasars with given luminosity reside in denser environment . generally speaking , close pairs of quasars would not necessary reside in clusters . and",
    "the same function for the fifth nearest neighbour could be better estimate , but the sample is not large enough for this",
    ".    in our case initial samples ( s1 ) are our five samples of quasars from different redshift intervals . in table 1",
    "@xmath17 is a number of objects in s1 , @xmath7 is a number of objects in subsamples s2 .",
    "note that the function @xmath18 is a complement to @xmath19 introduced by white in @xcite as @xmath20 it is readily seen that @xmath21 . the function @xmath19 is an estimate of the probability that the volume of radius r is empty .",
    "this is a complementary statistic to the correlation functions , because it depends on the correlation functions of all orders in an entirely symmetric way @xcite .",
    "if there was no luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering , this function would not depend on absolute magnitude at all . for verification of this statement 100 artificial samples",
    "were generated for each from 5 samples in the following way : the absolute magnitudes in the catalogue were permutated in random way , preserving right ascensions , declinations and redshifts on their places .",
    "this means that the spatial distribution of quasars ( clustering ) remains the same , but any luminosity dependence has to disappear .",
    "results are shown in the fig.1 - 5 , where only curves for bright and faint quasars are shown for clearness .",
    "open circles denote faint quasars , filled - bright ones . the same curves for permutated samples coincide ,",
    "thus they are denoted with one curve with open triangles ( only in the right parts of the plots ) .",
    "note , that the errors shown on the plots are statistical ones for initial samples and rms for artificial samples . on the scales less than the clustering scales one can see that the curves for bright quasars lie higher than for faint ones .",
    "but the difference between the values @xmath18 for quasars with different luminosities is statistically insignificant . only for @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "this difference is more then 1@xmath4 on scales of about @xmath24 .",
    "then the curves intersect on the scales of about half mean nearest neighbour distance . on larger scales",
    "the curves for faint quasars lie higher . and on the scale which could be some characteristic scale of the large - scale structure of the universe these curves coincide .",
    "this scale increases with the redshift .",
    "as we can see from the table 2 to obtain any reliable results with the first method one need much larger samples , which are unavailable for today .",
    "moreover the correlation length is the spatial scale of clustering on the one hand and a measure of the clustering amplitude on the other hand .",
    "thus it is not easy to interpret the first technique results unambiguously .",
    "that is why the second method seems to be better for this purpose because it is more direct and does not require such large samples .",
    "from the results of the second method we can say that brighter quasars reside in closer pairs than faint ones .",
    "note , that such splitting of f(r ) curves on larges scales could also be the consequence of the different redshift distributions of the quasars with different luminosities .",
    "but we know , that the bright quasars represent higher redshifts and the quasar density decreases with the redshift , thus the inverse effect would be present .",
    "anyway the difference between the mean redshift for subsamples of quasars with different luminosities ( see the last column of table 1 ) within each redshift interval is negligibly small and can not affect the results .",
    "anyway this problem requires further investigations and improvement of the methods .",
    "it would be interesting to compare for example , the same @xmath18 function for the fifth nearest neighbour or cross - correlation with galaxies .",
    "the last possibility could increase the sample , but this could be applied only for the lower redshift intervals , than those used in the present work .",
    "summing up the obtained results one can speal about luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering , but this dependence is not strong , which is in agreement with the results by porciani & norberg @xcite and theoretical predictions by lidz et al .",
    "but even if this dependence is weak , we do not have to neglect it .",
    "note that when we estimate e.g. the correlation length of the quasars on the low redshift we obtain the mean correlation length averaged over all the quasars with different luminosities .",
    "but on the high redshifts the obtained results correspond only to the correlation length for bright quasars and do not reflect the whole picture .",
    "that is why possible effects of luminosity dependence of quasar clustering should be taken into account when studying the redshift evolution of it .",
    "but even so one should keep in mind that the quasars ( as another agns ) do not reflect the whole distribution of extragalactic objects because quasars are considered to reside in the strongest peaks of the matter density .",
    "this fact could explain larger values of the correlation function for quasars than for galaxies ( see @xcite , @xcite for comparision ) .",
    "the author would like to thank prof .",
    "zhdanov for his help with the theoretical part of the work and useful discussions and also to both referees for their useful comments and advices .",
