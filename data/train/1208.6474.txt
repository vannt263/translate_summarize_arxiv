    "the fundamental symmetry underlying quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions , is the exact local @xmath3 color symmetry . as a consequence of the non - abelian nature of this symmetry the gauge fields of qcd , the gluons , are colored objects and therefore interact strongly with each other .",
    "because of confinement , one expects that gluons can also form colorless , or ` white ' , states which are called glueballs .",
    "the first calculations of glueball masses were based on the bag - model approach @xcite . later on , the rapid improvement of lattice qcd allowed for precise simulations of yang - mills theory , leading to a determination of the full glueball spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , in full qcd ( i.e. , gluons plus quarks ) the mixing of glueball and quark - antiquark configurations with the same quantum number occurs , rendering the identification of the resonances listed in the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite more difficult .",
    "the search for states which are ( predominantly ) glueball represents an active experimental and theoretical area of research , see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .  therein .",
    "the reason for these efforts is that a better understanding of the glueball properties would represent an important step in the comprehension of the non - perturbative behavior of qcd .",
    "however , although up to now some glueball candidates exist ( see below ) , no state which is ( predominantly ) glueball has been unambiguously identified .",
    "in general , a glueball state should fulfill two properties regarding its decays : it exhibits ` flavor blindness ' , because the gluons couple with the same strength to all quark flavors , and it is narrow , because qcd in the large-@xmath4 limit shows that all glueball decay widths scale as @xmath5 which should be compared to the @xmath6 scaling law for a quark - antiquark state . the lightest glueball state predicted by lattice qcd simulations is a scalar - isoscalar state ( @xmath7 ) with a mass of about @xmath8 gev @xcite .",
    "the resonance @xmath9 shows a flavor - blind decay pattern and is narrow , thus representing a good candidate for a state which is ( predominantly ) a scalar glueball . also the resonance @xmath10 is a glueball candidate because its mass is very close to lattice qcd predictions and it is copiously produced in the gluon - rich decay of the @xmath11 meson .",
    "both scenarios have been investigated in a variety of works , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein , in which mixing patterns involving the scalar resonances @xmath12 @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are considered . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the decays of the @xmath11 have been included in a phenomenological fit and both assignments turn out to be consistent , but slightly favour a predominant gluonic amount in @xmath9 .",
    "the second lightest lattice - predicted glueball state has tensor quantum numbers ( @xmath13 ) and a mass of about @xmath14 gev ; a good candidate could be the very narrow resonance @xmath15 @xcite , if the total spin of the latter will be experimentally confirmed to be @xmath16 .",
    "the third least massive glueball predicted by lattice qcd ( in the quenched approximation ) has pseudoscalar quantum numbers ( @xmath17 ) and a mass of about @xmath0 gev .",
    "quite remarkably , most theoretical works investigating the pseudoscalar glueball did not take into account this prediction of yang - mills lattice studies , but concentrated their search around @xmath18 gev in connection with the isoscalar - pseudoscalar resonances @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . a candidate for a predominantly light pseudoscalar glueball",
    "is the middle - lying state @xmath21 due to the fact that it is largely produced in ( gluon - rich ) @xmath11 radiative decays and is missing in @xmath22 reactions @xcite . in this framework",
    "the resonances @xmath23 and @xmath20 represent radial excitations of the resonances @xmath24 and @xmath25 . indeed , in relation to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , a lot of work has been done in determining the gluonic amount of their wave functions .",
    "the kloe collaboration found that the pseudoscalar glueball fraction in the mixing of the pseudoscalar - isoscalar states @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be large ( @xmath26% ) @xcite , but the theoretical work of ref .",
    "@xcite found that the glueball amount in @xmath24 and @xmath25 is compatible with zero [ see , however , also ref .",
    "@xcite]*. *    in this work we study the decay properties of a pseudoscalar glueball state whose mass lies , in agreement with lattice qcd , between @xmath27 and @xmath28 gev .",

    "@xcite we write down an effective chiral lagrangian which couples the pseudoscalar glueball field ( denoted as @xmath29 ) to scalar and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "we can thus evaluate the widths for the decays @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 stand for pseudoscalar and scalar quark - antiquark states .",
    "the pseudoscalar state @xmath32 refers to the well - known light pseudoscalars @xmath34 , while the scalar state @xmath33 refers to the quark - antiquark nonet of scalars above 1 gev : @xmath35 .",
    "the reason for the latter assignment is a growing consensus that the chiral partners of the pseudoscalar states should not be identified with the resonances below 1 gev , see refs .",

    "the chiral lagrangian that we construct contains one unknown coupling constant which can not be determined without experimental data .",
    "however , the branching ratios can be unambiguously calculated and may represent a useful guideline for experimental search of the pseudoscalar glueball in the energy region between @xmath27 to @xmath28 gev . in this respect , the planned panda experiment at the fair facility @xcite will be capable to scan the mass region above 2.5 gev . the experiment is based on proton - antiproton scattering , thus the pseudoscalar glueball @xmath29 can be directly produced as an intermediate state .",
    "we shall therefore present our results for the branching ratios for a putative pseudoscalar glueball with a mass of 2.6 gev .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that the pseudoscalar glueball @xmath29 has a mass that is a bit lower than the lattice qcd prediction and that it has been already observed in the besiii experiment where pseudoscalar resonances have been investigated in @xmath11 decays @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the resonance @xmath2 which has been clearly observed in the @xmath36 channel represents a good candidate , because it is quite narrow ( @xmath37 mev ) and its mass lies just below the lattice qcd prediction .",
    "for this reason we repeat our calculation for a pseudoscalar glueball mass of @xmath1 gev , and thus make predictions for the resonance @xmath2 , which can be tested in the near future .",
