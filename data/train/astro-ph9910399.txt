    "dwarf novae are interacting binary stars in which a roche - lobe filling main - sequence secondary looses mass through the @xmath2 point .",
    "the transferred mass falls along a ballistic trajectory towards the heavier white dwarf primary , forming an accretion disk .",
    "the disk undergoes semi - periodic collapse during which matter is accreted by the compact primary .",
    "the result is a release of gravitational energy which is observed as a system brightening .",
    "this is called a dwarf nova outburst .",
    "dwarf novae , a subclass of cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) , have been reviewed by warner ( 1995a ) .",
    "is a long cycle - length large - amplitude dwarf nova with only 7 outbursts recorded since 1918 ( e.g  vanmuster & howell 1996 ) and with an estimated distance from earth between 174 and 246 pc ( sproats et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "humps in the light curve of repeating with a 00708(3 ) period were observed by howell & szkody ( 1988 ) .",
    "they concluded that this dwarf nova is a candidate for su uma star probably seen under a large inclination .",
    "this assumption is supported by the finding of broad double emission - lines in the optical spectrum ( cristiani et al.1985 , szkody & howell 1991 ) .",
    "orbital humps are observed in some high - inclination dwarf novae ( e.g.  szkody 1992 ) , they probably reflect the pass of the disk - stream interacting region ( often named hot spot or bright spot ) along the observer s line of sight .",
    "the study of the hot spot variability of rz leo is potentially useful to constrain models of gas dynamics in close binary systems . in the classical view ,",
    "the hot spot is formed during the shock interaction of matter in the gaseous stream flowing from @xmath2 ( the inner lagrangian point ) with the outer boundary of the accretion disk .",
    "this picture was consistent with photometric observations of dwarf novae during many years . however , this view conflicts with recents observations indicating anomalous hot spots in many systems .",
    "for example , in many cases , doppler tomography does not show the effect of a hot spot at all , or indicates that the hot spot is not in the place where we would expect a collision between the gaseous stream and the outer boundary of the disk ( e.g.  wolf et al .",
    "1998 ) . to explain these findings ,",
    "the possibility of gas stream overflow has been worked out . in this view",
    "the hot spot is formed behind the white dwarf by the ballistic impact of a deflected stream passing over the white dwarf ( e.g.  armitage & livio 1998 , hessmann 1999 ) . however ,",
    "this scenario has not yet been confirmed by observations .",
    "furthermore , recent three - dimensional numerical simulations indicate the _ absence _ of a shock between the stream and the disk .",
    "the interaction between the stream and the _ common envelope _ of the system forms and extended shock wave along the edge of the stream , whose observational properties are roughly equivalent to those of a hot spot in the disk ( bisikalo et al .  1998 ) .",
    "this paper is aimed to confirm the reported photometric period and to establish a long - term hump ephemeris .",
    "we also expect to detect systematic luminosity trends and get insights about the hump variability and hot spot nature .",
    "interestingly , we find some phenomena conflicting , in many ways , with the classical scenario of the hot spot forming region .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      a review of the observations of early 1998 including the diskovery of  anti - humps \" was given by mennickent & sterken ( 1999 ) .",
    "here we present a more complete analysis of the phenomenon .",
    "9 shows in detail the events of early 1998 .",
    "the light curves have been binned with a period 00756 , accordingly to table 3 .",
    "the evolution of the hump is singular .",
    "it starts as a 015 absorption feature ( 07/01/98 ) then disappear from the light curve ( 11/01/98 and 06/02/98 ) and then re - appears like a small wave ( 07/02/98 ) and fully developed symmetrical hump ( 18/03/98 and 19/03/98 ) .",
    "secondary humps are also visible , with amplitude roughly 60% the main hump amplitude . on february 7",
    "a secondary absorption hump is also visible , along with the main absorption feature .",
    "these  anti - humps \" appear at the same phases where normal humps develop a month later .",
    "a close inspection to the data of february 7 reveals another alternative interpretation : the observed minima could define the base of the humps .",
    "we have rejected this hypothesis for three reasons : ( 1 ) it does not fit the ephemeris , indicating a possible shift of the hump maximum by about 0.2 cycles , ( 2 ) the peak - to - peak distance between main and secondary maxima should be 0.3 cycles instead 0.5 cycles , which is observed the other 3 nights and ( 3 ) the secondary maximum should be about 80% of the main peak , contrasting with a value of 60% observed other nights .",
    "we provide an interpretation for this phenomenon in the next section .",
    "fig.10 shows the hump s amplitude roughly anticorrelated with the nightly mean magnitude , as occurs in vw hyi ( warner 1975 ) . as shown in fig.9",
    ", this anti - correlation is not only due to the increase of hump brightness , but is also a true rise of the total systemic luminosity , through the whole orbital cycle .",
    "the outlier in fig.10 is a measure by howell & szkody ( 1988 ) which is a rather doubtful point .",
    "in fact , accordingly to these authors , since their primary goal was to obtain differential photometry  not absolute photometry  they calibrated their magnitudes using only a few standards per night .",
    "they give a formal error of 003 for the zero point of , but with so few standards observed , not in the same ccd field , it is difficult to control systematic errors due to variable seeing and atmospheric transparency . in the following , we will omit this outlier from our diskussion . returning to fig.10",
    ", we observe that the hump disappears when @xmath3 and attains maximum amplitude when @xmath4 .",
    "surprisingly , the hump becomes  negative \" ( i.e.  an absorption feature ) when the system drops below @xmath5 19 mag .",
    "a linear least squares fit to the hump amplitude @xmath6 yields :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 refers to the nightly mean @xmath8 magnitude .",
    "any reasonable model for the photometric variability of should reproduce the non - coherent humps and their amplitude variations .",
    "it is currently assumed that the humps reflect the release of gravitational energy when the gas stream hits the accretion disk .",
    "the disk s luminosity is produced by the same process when disk gas slowly spirals towards the central white dwarf ( e.g.  warner 1995a ) .",
    "an explanation for the varying humps could be a hotpsot moving along the outer disk rim",
    ". a bright spot co - rotating with the binary should reflect the binary orbital period , but random translations of the hot spot along the outer disk rim should produce a non - coherent signal .",
    "support for this view arises from the evidence of moving hot spots in some dwarf novae , e.g.   ( ratering et al .",
    "1993 ) and ( neustroev 1998 ) .",
    "the large scatter observed in the @xmath9 diagram of ( up to 0.4 cycles ) is atypical for dwarf novae .",
    "for example , ( eason et al .  1983 ) , ( wolf et al .  1993 ) and ( echevarra & alvarez 1993 ) show quasi - cyclic period variations , of small amplitude , on time scale of years . in these cases ,",
    "the @xmath9 residuals are always lower than 0.02 cycles .",
    "the interpretation of the changes observed in the above stars is still controversial .        in this section",
    "we analyze the events of early 1998 .",
    "the observed correlation between the hump amplitude and mean brightness might provide important clues on the numerical value of the disk viscosity .",
    "the hot spot and disk bolometric luminosity can be approximated by ( warner 1995a , eq .",
    "2.21a and 2.22a ) :    @xmath10    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mass and radius of the primary , @xmath14 the disk s radius and @xmath15 and @xmath16 the mass _ transfer _ and mass _ accretion _ rates , respectively .    in the following we assume that @xmath17 is proportional to the hump s peak luminosity and @xmath18 is proportional to the cycle mean luminosity .",
    "the disk luminosity so defined includes some contribution from the hot spot , but it is difficult to exclude the wide and long - lasting humps from the analysis .",
    "it is apparent from fig.9 and 10 that the increase of hot spot luminosity is followed by an increase of the disk s luminosity .",
    "this effect seems to be true , and not simply a consequence of the hump rising .    accordingly to eq .",
    "3 and 4 , the events of early 1998 may be interpreted as follows : a mass transfer burst starts at the secondary in january 1998 and then continues with increasing @xmath15 , until march 1998 .",
    "the burst , evidenced in the rising of hump s luminosity in fig.9 triggers an increase of mass accretion rate inside the disk , as observed in the rising of the total systemic luminosity .    the time scale for matter diffusion across the accretion disk ,",
    "is called the viscous time scale ( pringle 1981 ) :    @xmath19    where the viscosity is given by the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) _ ansatz _ :    @xmath20    with @xmath21 the half - thickness of the disk and @xmath22 the sound velocity . replacing eq .  6 in 5 and using typical parameters",
    "@xmath23 = 0.01 , @xmath24 cm , @xmath25 cm s@xmath26 we obtain    @xmath27    for the diffusion process observed in @xmath28 @xmath1 6.0 @xmath29 10@xmath30 s ( 70 days ) , we find @xmath0 = 0.08 , a common value among dwarf novae ( verbunt 1982 ) .",
    "this value contrasts with the low @xmath0 ( @xmath31 0.01 ) invoked to explain the long recurrence times and large amplitude outbursts of some dwarf novae , in particular ( meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "1998 ) . since our observations",
    "indicate a rather normal @xmath0 , the long recurrence time must be explained by another cause . in this context",
    "it is worthy to mention the hypothesis of inner disk depletion .    the removal of the inner disk by the influence of a magnetosphere ( livio & pringle 1992 ) or the effect of mass flow via a vertically extended hot corona above the cool disk ( also referred as  coronal evaporation \" , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 , liu et al .",
    "1997 , mineshige et al .",
    "1998 ) naturally explains the long recurrence times .",
    "spectroscopic evidence indicates that the inner disk depletion might be a common phenomenon in su uma stars ( mennickent & arenas 1998 , mennickent 1999 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that many large amplitude dwarf novae have bounced off from the orbital period minimum ( at @xmath1 80 min ) and are evolving to longer orbital periods with very old , brown - dwarf like secondaries ( howell et al .",
    "this view is supported by the finding of undermassive secondaries in ( ciardi et al .",
    "1998 ) and v592 her ( van teeseling et al .  1999 ) and the suspection  based on the ",
    "superhump \" mass ratio  of this kind of objects in and ( patterson 1998 ) . in principle",
    ", the large amplitude and long cycle length of suggest that this star is an ideal candidate for a post - period minimum system and therefore , for an undermassive secondary .",
    "since superhumps have not been yet detected in this star , the only way to investigate this view is analyzing the flux distribution .",
    "we have compiled data from different sources .",
    "they are generally non - simultaneous , and may contain possibly significant variations in the emission of the cvs .",
    "however , to minimize this effect , we have excluded data taken during outburst , and we have considered data from as few sources as possible and as close together in time as possible .    the flux distributions of and other dwarf noave with recognized brown - dwarf like secondaries ( and available photometric data ) are compared in fig.11 . the optical - ir flux of a steady disk , scaled to fit the ubv data of , is also shown .",
    "law ( lynden - bell 1969 ) . ]",
    "we find that , in contrast with that observed in the objects with undermassive secondaries , the flux distribution of does not drop in the red wavelengths , but rises with respect to the disk s contribution .",
    "this is expected if the secondary were a main - sequence red dwarf .",
    "in fact , the @xmath32 color of ( viz.3.65 , sproats el at .",
    "1996 ) is representative of a main sequence m0 star ( bessell & brett , 1988 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that most secondaries stars for cataclysmic variables with @xmath33 @xmath34 3 h are close to the solar abundance main sequence defined by single field stars ( beuermann et al .",
    "the above arguments probably rule out the possibility of an undermassive secondary in .",
    "our results indicate that large amplitude  long cycle length  dwarf novae might not necessarily correspond to objects in the same evolutive stage .",
    "we have shown that , in spite of the extreme cycle length and outburst amplitude , can not be properly named a _ like star _ , as suggested in the ritter & kolb catalogue ( 1998 ) .",
    "the ratio between hot spot and disk luminosity , for the case of an optically thick , steady state accretion disk and a simple planar bright spot on the edge of the disk , is ( warner 1995a , eq .  2.71 ) :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the systemic inclination , @xmath37 an efficience factor @xmath1 1 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the bolometric corrections ( @xmath34 0 ) for the spot and disk respectively .    roche - lobe geometry and the assumption of a disk radius 70% the roche lobe radius ( an usually good approximation for dwarf novae ) , yield to :    @xmath40    in addition , hot spot and disk temperatures inferred for dwarf novae indicate @xmath38 @xmath1 @xmath39 ( warner 1995a s diskussion after eq .  2.73 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore we obtain :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a function with a numerical value in the range 0.030.3 for most practical purposes .",
    "the condition of  anti - humps \" is given by :    @xmath43    the above equations suggest that the apparition of  anti - humps \" in a single system depends on the relative values of @xmath16 and @xmath15 . in particular , for , assuming the orbital and photometric periods equals , a mass ratio of 0.15 , i.e.  representative for dwarf novae below the period gap ( e.g.  mennickent et al .",
    "1999 ) , and a moderate inclination angle of 65@xmath44 , this occurs when @xmath45 ( assuming @xmath37 = 1 ) .",
    "the rarity of the phenomenon indicates that @xmath46 is a condition rarely fulfilled among dwarf novae and that @xmath15 is probably always larger or equal than @xmath47 .",
    "systems with large amplitude humps are candidates for @xmath15 @xmath48 @xmath47 whereas high inclination systems with no prominent humps ( e.g.  wx cet , mennickent 1994 ) are candidates for @xmath15 @xmath1 @xmath49 .",
    "we can estimate the mass accretion rate from the recurrence time : + @xmath50    ( eq .",
    "37 by warner 1995b ) . using a supercycle length",
    "@xmath51 2 yr we obtain @xmath52 g s@xmath26 .",
    "this implies that @xmath53 g s@xmath26 is required to develop  anti - humps \" .",
    "this condition is easily satisfied if the mass transfer rate is driven by gravitational radiation , as expected for a dwarf novae below the period gap . in this case , using the system parameters given above , we estimate : + @xmath54    from eq .  9.20 by warner ( 1995a ) .",
    "since the mass accretion rate @xmath16 is proportional to the viscosity ( e.g.  cannizzo et al .",
    "1998 ) , an extremely low @xmath0 disk is not a good site for developing  anti - humps \" .",
    "the reason is that , in this case , the condition imposed on the mass transfer rate to satisfy eq .  11 is too strong , requiring , probably , unrealistic low @xmath15 values .",
    "therefore the presence of  anti - humps \" in is consistent with the normal @xmath0 found in the previous section .",
    "* the light curve of rz leo during a time interval of 11-years is characterized by highly variable humps .",
    "* a non - coherent photometric period of 00756(2 ) is consistent with the data . *",
    "the hump amplitude is anti - correlated with the stellar mean brightness . *",
    "a new phenomenon was reported : the presence of  anti - humps \" when the system is faint .",
    "* anti - humps might result from a regime of very low mass transfer rate and normal alpha disks . *",
    "non - coherent humps are compatible with a non - steady hot spot . *",
    "the rapid response of the accretion disk to the enhanced mass transfer rate evidenced by the phenomena of early 1998 ( fig.9 ) suggests a disk with a normal viscosity parameter @xmath0 @xmath1 0.08 . *",
    "the possibility of an undermassive secondary is rejected by arguments concerning the observed optical and infrared flux distribution .",
