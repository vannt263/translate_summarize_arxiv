    "<S> * abstract : * we have studied some thermodynamics features of kiselev black hole and dilaton black hole . specifically we consider reissner nordstrm black hole surrounded by radiation and dust , and schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence , as special cases of kiselev solution . we have calculated the products of black hole thermodynamics parameters , including surface gravities , surface temperatures , komar energies , areas , entropies , horizon radii and the irreducible masses , at the inner and outer horizons . </S>",
    "<S> the products of surface gravities , surface temperature product and product of komar energies at the horizons are not universal quantities . for kiselev solutions products of areas and entropies at both the horizons are independent of mass of the black holes ( except for schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence ) . for charged dilaton black hole , </S>",
    "<S> all the products vanish . using the smarr formula approach , the first law of thermodynamics is also verified for kiselev solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transitions in the heat capacities are also observed . </S>"
