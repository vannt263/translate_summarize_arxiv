    "different from models starting at the grand unified scale , the ingredients for a creation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe in a first order electroweak phase transition ( pt ) have a fair chance to be tested experimentally in the near future . besides non - equilibrium the other two necessary criteria of sakharov for baryogenesis , cp and baryon number violation are naturally fulfilled by the cp violating bubble wall of a first order pt .",
    "the bubble wall separates the hot symmetric phase with rapid sphaleron transitions from the higgs phase , where sphaleron transitions are suppressed by @xmath3 .",
    "however it turned out that the electroweak standard model ( sm ) does not have a strong first order pt , indeed there is a crossover behavior and no pt at all for higgs masses beyond the present experimental bound @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cp - violation by the ckm matrix is very small . in spite of tremendous successes of the sm",
    "it is commonly believed that it has to be embedded / enlarged to a more fundamental theory .",
    "supersymmetry is supposed to be an important facet of such a theory but it is still not backed by experiments . in concrete susy models , in order to have a strong first order pt one has to strengthen the ( one loop ) `` @xmath4 '' term of the effective potential or to have such a term already on the tree level . in the minimal susy extension of the sm , the mssm , the superpartner of the right - handed top - with a mass below that of the top - gives such a strong @xmath4 loop correction . with a negative susy breaking scalar mass",
    "it is almost massless in the hot phase and has a strong yukawa coupling to the higgs fields .",
    "this is confirmed by detailed analytical @xcite and lattice calculations @xcite , showing a strong first order pt even for higgs masses as large as 110 gev just beyond the experimental bound for mssm higgses .",
    "there are also possible cp - violating phases in the higgs lagrangian if 1-loop effects are taken into account @xcite .",
    "they are restricted much by the measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment unless one invokes special conditions",
    ". a recent investigation of a possible spontaneous cp - violation just in the bubble wall at the temperatures of the pt gave negative results @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to discuss baryogenesis in a strong first order electroweak pt ( ewpt ) in much detail starting from a model where all the three criteria given above can be fulfilled without much problem .",
    "this is a supersymmetric model with an additional gauge singlet superfield . in its original form ( nmssm )",
    "is was designed to substitute the problematic @xmath5 term of the mssm superpotential by a coupling @xmath6 @xcite @xmath7 with a @xmath8-symmetry whose spontaneous breaking causes dangerous domain walls in the early cosmos @xcite .",
    "the soft susy breaking potential contains a term @xmath9 which can act as a @xmath4 term if both the vevs of the higgses and of the singlet are of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "but in a @xmath8-symmetric model with universal susy breaking this turns out not to be possible if one wants to have a reasonable spectrum of particles .    in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite we thus add further terms to the superpotential which now obtains the form @xmath10 and is not @xmath8-symmetric anymore .",
    "the soft susy breaking lagrangian contains scalar masses , gaugino masses and @xmath11-terms @xmath12 thus we have reintroduced a @xmath13-term and we have the associated fine - tuning problem known from the mssm @xcite .",
    "additionally , there is the danger of quadratically divergent singlet tadpoles @xcite .",
    "such tadpole diagrams require three ingredients : ( i ) a singlet field ( ii ) non - renormalizable interactions and ( iii ) soft susy breaking terms .",
    "( i ) giving the `` singlet '' a charge under some discrete symmetry one can remove the tadpoles from the very beginning .",
    "but the discrete symmetry can not be exact in order to avoid unacceptable domain walls at the ewpt @xcite .",
    "( ii ) in refs .",
    "@xcite models with gauged r - symmetry or duality symmetry , both broken at some superheavy scale have been proposed to forbid dangerous non - renormalizable operators . on the renormalizable level",
    "these models typically have no discrete symmetries , and therefore are not plagued by the domain wall problem .",
    "while such models do not solve the @xmath13-problem , they are still very interesting with respect to higgs phenomenology and the ewpt . for that reason we will study this type of singlet model in the following .",
    "( iii ) another way to evade the tadpole divergences restricts the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "`` gauge mediated susy breaking '' ( gmsb ) in the context of singlet models does not have domain wall problems .",
    "a @xmath13-parameter is generated by radiative corrections and the singlet vev @xcite .",
    "however one of the special properties of gmsb models seems to be the strong suppression of @xmath11-terms .",
    "these however also contain the @xmath14-type term responsible for a strong first order pt .    in order not to have too many parameters we use universality of susy breaking at the gut scale and run renormalization group equations to get down to the electroweak scale . with such a lagrangian and adding the temperature corrections we can demonstrate @xcite that one can easily get a strong first order pt for higgs masses as high as 115 gev and superpartner masses beyond present experimental limits .",
    "the effective potential in @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be used to derive differential equations for the bubble wall profile and for varying cp - violating phases in the bubble wall arising from constant explicit phases in the theory or , more interesting , from spontaneous cp - violation .",
    "this is described in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "as worked out in section 6 , in the wkb approximation the cp - violating phases in the bubble wall create terms in the dispersion relations which differ between particles and anti - particles .",
    "this gives rise to a driving term in the boltzmann equation for the difference of particle and anti - particle chemical potentials , in particular for left - handed quarks and their superpartners .",
    "this difference is converted into a baryon asymmetry by the hot phase sphalerons in front of the proceeding bubbles .",
    "weak scale supersymmetric models have many unknown parameters related to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "a considerable part of this parameter space is excluded because of fcnc or the appearance of charge and color breaking vacua .",
    "these problems are partially evaded by imposing universality of the soft terms at the gut scale , @xmath18 gev , where the sm gauge couplings unify . at the gut scale",
    "there is a common gaugino mass @xmath19 , a universal scalar mass squared @xmath20 and a universal trilinear coupling @xmath21 .",
    "thus , universal susy breaking drastically reduces the parameters of the model to @xmath22 the subscript `` 0 '' indicates that the masses and couplings are evaluated at the gut scale .",
    "@xmath23 denotes the top yukawa coupling which we consider in the following . ] , and @xmath24 is the soft higgs mass term corresponding to the @xmath13-term in the superpotential .",
    "since the masses of the top quark and the @xmath25-boson mass are known , `` only '' seven parameters of ( [ ph1 ] ) are independent .    to evolve the parameters from the gut scale to the weak scale we use the renormalization group equations ( rges ) in the 1-loop approximation . for the @xmath8-symmetric case",
    "the relevant rges have already been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . defining @xmath26 the @xmath8-breaking terms @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are easily included with help of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath29    even with the simple universal pattern of soft breaking terms we are left with a 9-dimensional parameter space .",
    "additionally , we must satisfy two constraints coming from the z - boson and top quark masses . in the literature ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , usually `` random shooting '' is applied to deal with such a situation .",
    "this means randomly chosen sets of gut scale parameters are evolved to the electroweak scale , where their phenomenological implications are investigated .",
    "although the physical z - boson mass can easily be reproduced by an appropriate rescaling of the dimensionful parameters , one typically is still plagued by some light unobserved susy particles or an unphysical top quark mass .",
    "therefore this procedure is rather inefficient .",
    "furthermore , random shooting only provides statistical averages and correlations . to avoid these shortcomings we use the more systematic approach which we introduced in ref .",
    "it allows the elimination of @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 by the higgs and singlet vevs , while maintaining universal susy breaking .",
    "it relies on the observation that the @xmath8-breaking terms @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 do not enter the rges for the remaining parameters .",
    "they can therefore be calculated without specifying the former ones .",
    "our procedure consists of the following steps and is also sketched in fig .",
    "[ f_elim ] :    * fix the values of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 at the weak scale .",
    "the choice of @xmath34 automatically fixes @xmath23 by the relation @xmath35 gev ) . *",
    "evolve @xmath23 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 to the gut scale .",
    "* choose a set of the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 at the gut scale .",
    "* run all parameters down to the weak scale , with exception of @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 whose initial conditions have not yet been specified at this point .",
    "* at the weak scale calculate @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 by using the saddle point conditions for the 1-loop higgs potential @xmath36 @xmath37 at @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "finally one can use the corresponding rges to determine the values of @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 at the gut scale .",
    "appropriate values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 can always be found because of the effectively linear structure of eqs .",
    "( [ rge ] ) . our procedure has the additional benefit that the constraints coming from the top quark and z - boson masses , @xmath44 , are automatically built in .",
    "( 200,150 ) ( -15,-440 )    this reduces the number of free parameters by two so we are finally left with the 7-dimensional parameter space @xmath45    of course , not every parameter set leads to a viable phenomenology .",
    "the constraints on the model parameters are related to the particle spectrum and the vacuum structure . in the elimination procedure",
    "discussed before we assumed that the extremum parametrized by @xmath46 , @xmath34 and @xmath47 is indeed the global minimum of the scalar potential .",
    "thus we must ( numerically ) verify that there are no deeper minima in @xmath48 . if there appears a deeper minimum the parameter set has to be discarded .",
    "additional constraints arise from the required absence of charge and color breaking minima ( ccb minima ) deeper than the standard minimum , i.e.  from the absence of squark and slepton vevs .",
    "we check slepton and squark vevs induced by large trilinear couplings @xcite . furthermore , there are ccb minima which come from negative scalar mass squares , typically @xmath49 .",
    "these dangerous directions involve higgs , squark and slepton fields ( `` ufb '' directions ) .",
    "the condition for such a minimum not to be deeper than the standard minimum implies a lower limit on the ratio @xmath50 of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "however , the decay rate of the standard vacuum into a minimum in the ufb direction is usually negligible compared to the age of the universe .",
    "we therefore allow for a meta - stable standard vacuum with respect to the ufb directions and disregard the corresponding constraints .    up to now , no superpartners of the sm particles have been detected . from the experimental lower limits on the",
    "susy particle masses @xcite various constraints on the parameter space can be derived .",
    "the experimental limit on the chargino mass @xmath52 gev @xcite translates into bounds on the universal gaugino mass and the @xmath13 parameter @xmath53 if the bound on @xmath19 is satisfied the gluino mass @xmath54 is automatically above its experimental limit @xcite . in the case of @xmath55 gev",
    "also the squark and slepton masses are compatible with the experimental data .    of particular importance",
    "are the properties of the lightest neutral cp - even higgs mass eigenstate @xmath56 , which is a mixture of the higgses and the singlet .",
    "if @xmath56 has a large singlet content its coupling to the z - boson and thus its production cross section at lep is significantly reduced @xcite .",
    "parameter sets ( [ rge7 ] ) can not be ruled out by simply calculating the lightest higgs mass @xmath57 .",
    "for example , if the higgs production cross section is reduced by a factor of 10 compared to the sm , higgs masses down to about 60 gev are still in agreement with the data @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ f_pht0 ] we present a scan of the @xmath19-@xmath21 plane for two different sets of @xmath58 @xcite . the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath21 are of particular interest since they determine the values of the trilinear couplings at the weak scale which will play a prominent role in the discussion of the ewpt in section 3 .",
    "we have taken @xmath55 gev in order avoid light squarks and sleptons . choosing a small value of @xmath32 and a large value of @xmath33 prevents the appearance of very light higgs bosons . in fig .",
    "[ f_pht0]b we increased @xmath34 and the singlet vev to obtain large higgs masses up to 115 gev .",
    "the increase of @xmath57 with decreasing @xmath21 can be traced to the singlet diagonal entry in the higgs boson mass matrix which is diminished by the @xmath59 contribution . on the same lines",
    "the increasing singlet content of the lightest cp - even higgs state with increasing @xmath21 can be understood . in fig .",

    "the lower bound on @xmath19 is a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ cnstr3 ] ) .",
    "the requirement of the standard minimum being the global minimum of the higgs potential implies the upper and lower bounds on @xmath21 displayed in fig .",
    "[ f_pht0 ] .",
    "constraints from the required absence of @xmath11-term induced ccb minima are then automatically satisfied .",
    "note that @xmath19 is also bounded from above . in fig .",
    "[ f_pht0 ] we excluded parameter sets which predict @xmath61 gev .",
    "this leads to the upper bound on @xmath21 in fig .",
    "[ f_pht0]a . in fig .",
    "[ f_pht0]b no additional constraint arises , because of the larger higgs masses . on the other hand , if we would allow for smaller higgs masses in fig .",
    "[ f_pht0]a , still an upper bound on @xmath21 would be implied by the vacuum structure , as is the case in fig .",
    "[ f_pht0]b . taking into account the data from the higgs boson search further restricts the upper bounds on @xmath19 and @xmath21 . roughly , the regions @xmath62 gev in the @xmath63 set , and @xmath64 gev in the @xmath65 set are additionally excluded by the higgs boson data @xcite .",
    "these parameter regions are characterized by a very heavy spectrum of susy particles .",
    "for that reason they are not very promising candidates for the implementation of electroweak baryogenesis anyway , as will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "we close this section by emphasizing some important differences between our model and the @xmath8-symmetric nmssm , which is usually considered in the literature , e.g.  in refs .  @xcite . by setting @xmath66 eq .  ( [ cnstr3 ] )",
    "can be translated into a lower bound on the singlet vev , @xmath67 gev . however , the analysis of the @xmath8-symmetric case carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the actual lower bound on @xmath60 is much larger , once all phenomenological constraints are taken into account .",
    "typically one has a singlet vev in the multi - tev range and couplings @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in the next section",
    "we will discuss that in such a scenario the singlet is just a spectator during the ewpt , which proceeds more or less in the standard ( i.e.  mssm ) way .",
    "this property additionally motivates our inclusion of the @xmath13-term in the model , while it seems questionable whether the idea of electroweak baryogenesis can be realized in the @xmath8-symmetric nmssm .",
    "an additional peculiarity of the @xmath8-symmetric model is that large @xmath11-terms are required for successful electroweak symmetry breaking , leading to @xmath72 .",
    "however , this parameter range is severely constrained from the absence of ccb minima @xcite .",
    "some of the special features reported in ref .",
    "@xcite may be due to the assumption of universal soft susy breaking used in that work .",
    "it seems questionable , however , if the problematic bound , @xmath73 , can be evaded in the case of non - universal soft terms @xcite , since the required large values of @xmath32 typically lead to small values of the higgs mass due to large higgs singlet mixing .",
    "the nmssm with and without @xmath8 symmetry also have different properties with respect to cp - violation , as will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "order and strength of the ewpt are central questions in electroweak baryogenesis . only in the case of a first order phase transition ( pt )",
    "the associated departure from equilibrium is sufficient to induce a relevant baryon number production . to avoid baryon number washout after the pt the even stronger criterion @xmath74 has to be satisfied , where @xmath75 denotes the higgs vev at the critical temperature @xmath76 .",
    "a first order phase transition is triggered by cubic terms in the finite temperature effective potential @xcite . in the ( ms)sm",
    "these terms arise from 1-loop thermal corrections of bosons and therefore are small from the very beginning .",
    "thus it is difficult to satisfy @xmath77 . in the nmssm , on the other hand , trilinear terms enter already the tree - level higgs potential due to higgs singlet couplings , leading to a significantly stronger ewpt @xcite .",
    "these contributions stem from the soft susy breaking couplings @xmath78 and @xmath59 , and from the @xmath13-term @xmath79 all these trilinear terms explicitly contain the singlet field .",
    "therefore , in order to induce deviations from the ( ms)sm behavior also the singlet vev must change during the phase transition . since at the ewpt thermal contributions to the effective potential are of the order @xmath80 , this requires the mass and the vev of the singlet also to be of the order of the electroweak scale .    at finite temperature the effective potential of the neutral higgs and singlet fields",
    "is modified by the interaction with the hot plasma @xmath81 in the 1-loop zero temperature corrections @xmath82 we include tops , stops and gauge bosons , while in the 1-loop finite temperature part @xmath83 also higgs bosons , neutralinos and charginos are taken into account .",
    "we do not make a high temperature expansion , as some of the particles can be heavy in part of the field space .",
    "rather , @xmath83 is evaluated using a spline interpolation between the high and low temperature regions .",
    "we stress that in the range of parameters we will study a strong first order ewpt is the consequence of the tree - level terms in the higgs potential ( [ strength5 ] ) . since the stop mass will turn out to be always larger than 200 gev , the thermally induced cubic terms are too small to account for @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the most important finite temperature effect is the appearance of thermal effective masses @xmath85 where the constant encodes the couplings of the higgs and singlet fields to the particles in the plasma .",
    "it is this positive thermal contribution to the higgs mass that makes the symmetric phase stable at high temperatures , and thus causes the restoration of the electroweak symmetry . using the complete 1-loop expression rather than the simple high temperature approximation , is just a convenient prescription to handle the decoupling of heavy particles . because of the dominance of the tree potential , we neglect contributions to the thermal potential stemming from daisy resummation @xcite and 2-loop diagrams @xcite .    in order to determine the strength of the pt one has to compute the critical temperature @xmath76 .",
    "we define @xmath76 as being the temperature where the symmetric and the broken minimum of the finite temperature higgs potential ( [ strength1 ] ) become degenerate .",
    "we denote the higgs and singlet vevs in the broken phase by @xmath86 . in general",
    ", the singlet vev is different from zero even in the symmetric phase .",
    "we refer to a pt as being `` strongly first order '' , if it avoids baryon number washout , according to the condition @xmath84 .",
    "since both higgs fields contribute to the sphaleron energy , @xmath75 is given by @xmath87 , where the factor of @xmath88 is due to our choice of field normalization .",
    "although cp - violation is essential for baryogenesis , we assume cp - conservation in this section , i.e.  all vevs , mass parameters and coupling constants are taken real valued .",
    "of course , we have to verify that @xmath89 has no deeper cp - violating minimum . turning on phases much smaller than one",
    "would induce only marginal changes in our results .    in this paragraph",
    "we study again the two parameter sets already discussed in the context of fig .",
    "[ f_pht0 ] in section 2 .",
    "we determine the critical temperature by numerical minimization of @xmath89 . after having checked that no cp - violating minima are present we disregard the imaginary parts of the higgs and singlet fields .",
    "we then only have to minimize @xmath89 in the real valued fields @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "our investigations of the strength of the pt are summarized in fig .",
    "[ f_amscan ] where the regions of strong and weak pt in the @xmath19-@xmath21 plane are displayed for the two parameter sets of fig .",
    "[ f_pht0 ] @xcite . in case of @xmath63 and @xmath93 gev ( fig .",
    "[ f_amscan]a ) the pt is strongly first order in most part of the phenomenologically allowed range of parameters .",
    "however , the corresponding higgs masses up to 90 gev are compatible with the experimental higgs mass bounds only because of the reduced higgs production cross section due to higgs singlet mixing . in the parameter set of fig .",
    "[ f_amscan]b we increased @xmath94 and @xmath60 in order to obtain larger higgs masses . as a consequence ,",
    "the region of weakly first order pt is enlarged . however , a strong pt occurs still for a wide range of the parameters , while higgs masses up to 115 gev are consistent with @xmath84 .",
    "in contrast to the sm or the mssm where the pt definitely becomes weaker with increasing higgs masses the situation in the nmssm is more complicated .",
    "larger higgs masses can be related to a stronger phase transition .",
    "this may happen for example if the broken and symmetric minima of the effective potential are almost degenerate already at zero temperature .",

    "the baryon asymmetry strongly depends on the velocity of the bubble wall , which in the nmssm has not been computed so far .",
    "interesting enough , we find that the maximal baryon number is generated for @xmath268 .",
    "this is a typical value for the wall velocity in the mssm .    finally , we studied the dependence of the chargino source terms on @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",

    "@xcite . if @xmath310 , baryon production is partially suppressed by strong sphalerons .",
    "concluding , the nmssm can account for the observed baryon asymmetry , especially if @xmath311 and if the squark spectrum is rather non - degenerate , or if transitional cp - violation occurs .",
