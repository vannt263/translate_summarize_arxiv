    "lower bounds on neutrino masses have not been found yet in direct laboratory experiments . in particular",
    ", in the case of neutrinoless double - beta decay one expects a decrease of an upper bound on the majorana mass @xmath2 only .",
    "this current improvement of upper limits on neutrino masses takes a long time and strong efforts .",
    "however , we can not justify on this way whether neutrino is really the majorana particle or it can be the dirac one , or a mixture of them ( zkm - neutrino ) .    in this connection",
    "let us recall the old experiment by davis@xcite who demonstrated that neutrino and antineutrino are indeed different particles if we are using @xmath3 from the beta - decay @xmath4 as the incident `` neutrino '' for the capture process @xmath5 .",
    "negative result of the experiment@xcite , @xmath6 , is not an evidence that @xmath7 and @xmath3 are the dirac neutrinos with the fixed lepton number @xmath8 . in such experiments the",
    "helicity @xmath9 ( upper signs for @xmath7 ) is appropriate quantum number which is conserved due to the @xmath10 law of charged current weak interaction rather the lepton number .",
    "both the right - handed majorana neutrino and the dirac antineutrino with the same helicity @xmath11 could be emitted in the beta decay @xmath4 with the following suppression of the spin - flip @xmath12 in the process of capture in the chlorine detector ( the latter is true to the order of @xmath13 in the cross section ) .",
    "thus this example demonstrates the well - known fact that _ in the massless limit @xmath14 majorana and dirac neutrinos are not distinguishable_. we can not mark any difference between the fully - polarized right - handed majorana neutrino @xmath15 and the right -handed dirac antineutrino @xmath16 as well as between the left - handed majorana neutrino @xmath17 and the dirac left - handed one , @xmath18 ( see below section 3 ) .    in turn , if an incident neutrino flux became _ partially - polarized _ this would give a chance to distinguish these particles .",
    "we propose here a new way for distinction of majorana and dirac neutrino in the solar neutrino experiments by studying the profiles of the electron spectra in the low - energy @xmath0-scattering for incident @xmath19 and @xmath20 fluxes .",
    "it seems possible when solar neutrino flux is partially - polarized .",
    "the ultrarelativistic neutrinos produced in thermonuclear reactions within solar interior are evidently the left - handed ones ( fully - polarized @xmath17 ) and one needs to assume some mechanism for their conversion to the right - handed neutrinos .    first , the conversions @xmath21 in the majorana case or @xmath22 in the dirac case are obviously based on the assumption of a non - vanishing neutrino mass @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to nonzero neutrino diagonal @xcite and transition @xcite dipole moments and , therefore , to the possible neutrino spin @xcite and spin - flavor precession @xcite in vacuum in the presence of an external magnetic field . in a medium neutrino oscillations and spin - flavor precession",
    "can occur as the resonant conversions @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the spin - flavor conversion in combination with the msw - mechanism can lead to the right - handed majorana neutrino production ( @xmath21 @xcite , see below section 2 ) , i.e. to a mixture of the left - and right - handed active neutrinos as a partially - polarized @xmath26 neutrino flux incident upon underground detectors .",
    "in contrast to the majorana neutrino case , for the same conditions in the sun the right - handed dirac neutrinos produced via the spin - flip @xmath22 or in the cascade conversions @xmath27 appear to be sterile ones with respect to the @xmath0-scattering in detectors .",
    "notice that necessary large values of transition moments ( even without direct proportionality to @xmath28 ) can be obtained in some extended models obeying all known laboratory , astrophysical and cosmological constraints on neutrino masses and on its dipole moments .    for all majorana and dirac neutrinos with a mass below @xmath29 the most restrictive limit on dipole or transition magnetic and electric moments @xmath30 arises from the absence of anomalous neutrino emission from the red - giant cores just before helium ignition@xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath31 follows from a kinematic limit on the neutrino energy @xmath32 lost in the plasmon decay @xmath33 since the plasma frequency in a degenerate electron gas of red- giants is bounded in the same region , @xmath34 .",
    "a large dirac neutrino magnetic moment ( both diagonal and transition ones , @xmath35 ) was also excluded from sn1987a neutrino events in the + kamiokande and imb detectors .",
    "this is due to non - observation there of a hard energy tail stipulated by the sterile @xmath36 emission from a hot supernova core@xcite .",
    "these neutrinos could be produced within core via the electromagnetic scattering ( see below eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) ) and then be converted to the active @xmath17 in the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "the absence of sn1987a constraint in the majorana case means that the model - dependent estimate of @xmath37 @xcite seems to be less consistent even for light neutrinos suitable for the resonant spin - flavor or the msw conversions in the sun .",
    "therefore the laboratory constraint from reactor antineutrino experiments which is common for diagonal and transition magnetic moments , @xmath38 @xcite , remains an upper estimate of majorana neutrino transition moments corresponding to effective neutrino conversions within solar convective zone with magnetic fields of order @xmath39 .",
    "on the other hand , in magnetic hydrodynamics one can not exclude solutions with a strong magnetic field near bottom of the convective zone of the sun , @xmath40@xcite , and even larger within solar core for equilibrium hydromagnetic configuration in the gravitational field , @xmath41@xcite . as a result even for the case when the limit @xmath42@xcite is valid we may apply some mechanisms for effective spin - flavor conversions .",
    "notice also that the most stringent constraints on transition magnetic moments + @xmath43 were derived in @xcite from the primordial nucleosynthesis bound on additional neutrino species and from a supernova energy loss argument .",
    "these bounds were obtained in @xcite for _ active - sterile neutrino conversions neglecting neutrino mixing _ and in a medium with random magnetic fields .",
    "therefore this approach has no relation to our consideration here since we are using the models @xcite _ for active - active neutrino conversions_.    in the end of section 2 we consider experimental bounds on @xmath15 and give a theoretical interpretation of some contradictions in the model used .",
    "in particular , we consider an important question how to avoid some known lacks of the spin - flavor scenario @xcite with the use of large neutrino magnetic moments that inevitably leads to contradiction with non - observation of temporal variations of the solar neutrino flux in the most of current experiments .",
    "then in section 3 we show why the scattering of partially - polarized neutrino flux off electrons should be absolutely different for majorana and dirac neutrino provided that their right - handed components interact ( do not interact in the dirac case ) with electrons .    in section 4",
    "we discuss results and crucial parameters of the model used .",
    "the main assumption here is the presence of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath15 , @xmath36 produced by some mechanism within the sun . for instance , in the spin - flavor scenario involving majorana neutrinos the sun would be a source for antineutrinos , some of which could be @xmath15 s by a combination of spin - flavor ( @xmath25 ) and flavor ( @xmath44 ) oscillations ( or due to permutation of steps above , @xmath45 ) .",
    "this scenario was in detail elaborated in @xcite for the case of twisting magnetic field that allowed authors to avoid the suppression of the cascade conversion @xmath21 caused by the almost full compensation of the partial ( two - step ) amplitudes , @xmath46 , ( for a small neutron abundance in the sun ) .",
    "moreover , authors @xcite found conditions when either @xmath17- @xmath15-system decouples from @xmath47 and @xmath48 or the triple resonances merge and a resonant transition leads to a complete @xmath21-conversion . in the case of separation of @xmath17- @xmath15-system the adiabaticity condition is not fulfilled ( at least for the convective zone in the sun ) while for the triple resonance the relevant adiabaticity parameters at the merging point depend on neutrino energy .    as result",
    "authors@xcite predict that the @xmath15-flux should have a peak at the energy @xmath49 defined by the resonant condition .",
    "explicitely this occurs for @xmath50 at @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the mixing parameter ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the neutrino squared mass difference ; @xmath55 is the neutrino transition magnetic moment ; @xmath56 is the amplitude of the twisting magnetic field * b*@xmath57 which is perpendicular to the momentum * k * of an ultrarelativistic neutrino , @xmath58 .    since the position and the width of the peak strongly depend on the magnetic field strength in the region of resonance , the energy spectrum of resonantly emitted solar @xmath15 s",
    "should exhibit characteristic time dependence .",
    "in particular , depending on the signs of @xmath59 in the northern and southern solar hemispheres the semiannual neutrino flux variation ) leads to the minimum of the neutrino interaction term @xmath60 for the two season positions of the earth ( in june and december ) when the solar core is viewed from the earth through the solar equator .",
    "] can be either enhanced or suppressed . moreover ,",
    "the energy at which the @xmath15-spectrum achieves the maximum should vary in time .",
    "note also other ways of the majorana @xmath3-production like @xmath61-decay ( to majoron ) enhanced in solar matter @xcite . in this case",
    "we do not need any strong magnetic field in the sun or the presence of a large neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "however , the @xmath3-spectrum differs in such case from the initial one for left - handed neutrinos that prevents from the approach developed below .",
    "the active dirac antineutrino @xmath62 never can be produced in the sun due to absence there of the annihilation process @xmath63 which is important , for instance , in a supernova .",
    "however , in the same twisting magnetic field the resonant @xmath64-conversions lead to the production of the sterile neutrinos @xmath65 through a diagonal magnetic moment @xmath66@xcite ( neglecting neutrino flavor mixing ) or analogously to the majorana case in the presence of mixing and via a transition magnetic moment for the system of the active @xmath67 , @xmath68 neutrinos and their sterile @xmath69 , @xmath70- components .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is well - known that the kamiokande data already yield restrictive limits on a solar @xmath15-flux at the high energy region , @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "this limit was found from an isotropic background accounting also for @xmath15 s due to the relatively large cross - section @xmath72 with the isotropic distribution of positrons , where @xmath73 .",
    "the best relative limit is at @xmath74 where the @xmath15 flux is less than 5.8 % of @xmath75 solar @xmath7 s at 90% cl .",
    "however , since the @xmath21-conversion within the sun depends on neutrino energy , sign of @xmath59 , etc . , and",
    "due to the absence of the kamiokande limit for such process below @xmath76 we can not exclude the presence of right - handed majorana neutrinos emitted by the sun , in particular , for the low - energy beryllium neutrinos ( the line @xmath77 ) .",
    "one expects to observe these neutrinos in the borexino ( 1998 ? ) and the hellaz experiments where a scintillation detector@xcite and a helium gas at azote temperature@xcite should have a low - energy threshold .",
    "notice that for the beryllium neutrino line emitted by the sun the reaction @xmath78 vanishes because of its high threshold @xmath79 , but the parallel branch@xmath80-scattering contributes to the counting of neutrino events starting from a detector threshold .    in",
    "anyway , since we assume here the right - handed neutrinos are producing in the sun and the first scenario @xcite realizes , there appear some known objections concerning a large value @xmath81 for an effective neutrino spin reversal or non - observation of the semiannual flux variations in the current neutrino experiments .",
    "really , from the astrophysical bound on any dirac and majorana neutrino magnetic moments @xmath82@xcite it follows that necessary neutrino spin reversal when the dimensionless parameter @xmath83 should be of the order unity , @xmath84 , is provided by the sufficiently strong magnetic fields @xmath85 applied along a half of the width of the convective zone , @xmath86 .",
    "even such magnetic fields would not be in contrary with some estimates in magnetic hydrodynamics@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a more weakened and model - independent laboratory constraint @xmath87@xcite seems to be reasonable for a majorana neutrino for which the sn1987a energy loss argument@xcite does not work in contrast to the dirac case .",
    "this means that magnetic field strength in the sun could be less than for the dirac case , or quite realistic values @xmath88 would be sufficient for effective spin - flavor conversions .",
    "non - observation of the semiannual flux variations , perhaps , is explained either by unsuccessful sign of the angular velocity @xmath59 for the twisting magnetic field in both solar hemispheres ( in mechanism @xcite under consideration , see above ) ) or even more simpler than in @xcite without any specific geometry of a magnetic field : by the presence of random magnetic fields which always exist in addition to a regular magnetic field and can have the same strength of the r.m.s .",
    "field @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast to regular field , random magnetic fields do not disappear at the equatorial plane while @xmath90 elsewhere and their scale @xmath91 is much less than the regular field one .",
    "thus one can pronounce that experimental bounds at present do not exclude the possible observation of the low - energy @xmath15 s in future solar neutrino experiments .",
    "both right - handed majorana ( active ) neutrinos and right - handed ( sterile ) dirac neutrinos can influence the observed neutrino events but in different ways .",
    "really , below we find that for partially polarized electron neutrino , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the spin density matrix of the solar neutrino flux ( @xmath94 ) with the initial momentum directed along z - axis , * k*@xmath95= @xmath96 , the differential cross - sections of weak interactions , @xmath97 , are the different ones for dirac and majorana neutrinos .",
    "the main point is that the difference of the cross - sections gives the different electron energy spectrum profiles for two kinds of neutrino .    as well as in the case of a dirac neutrino in @xcite the polarization components of electron majorana neutrinos in eq .",

    "if a sharp difference in the slope of lines for the majorana neutrinos ( `` b '' , `` c '' , `` d '' lines in fig.1 ) and for the dirac ones ( `` e '' , `` f '' ) was marked in the borexino or hellaz experiment this would be a test whether the solar neutrinos are the majorana particles or they are the dirac ones .",
    "_ it does not matter which concrete value of unknown parameter @xmath60 influencing the survival probability p occurs within the sun _ : all corresponding lines given in fig.1 for the same probabilities ( pairs ( `` b '' , `` e '' ) and ( `` c '' , `` f '' ) ) have quite different slopes .    emphasize that we have simplified the observable averaged cross sections + @xmath229 using @xmath142-function for the beryllium neutrinos .",
    "all lines are interrupted at @xmath230 ( see also fig.2,3 ) and authors@xcite are planning to distinguish the `` signature edge '' of the recoil spectrum from the monoenergetic be neutrino flux .",
    "this difference appears also for a non - separated system ( merging of resonances in the mechanism@xcite ) shown in fig .",
    "2 for the particular equipartition case @xmath231 when the @xmath177-scattering is taken into account .",
    "the similar difference between majorana and dirac neutrino cases can be found from the total cross section behavior shown in fig.3 for the separated electron neutrino system ( a=1 ) .",
    "these cross sections @xmath232 contribute to the total number of neutrino events which can be observed in some different energy bins separated by the different thresholds @xmath233 .",
    "for a low energy region all lines depending on the different parameters p which correspond to the majorana neutrino cross sections become parallel to each other ( lines `` b '' , `` c '' in fig .",
    "3 ) but the analogous dirac neutrino cross - sections ( lines `` d '' , `` e '' with the same p as in the majorana case ) change their slope .",
    "thus , if the magnetic field value @xmath56 in the sun is somehow changing and , therefore , influences the total cross section @xmath234 ( i.e. leads to the transition @xmath235 , or @xmath236 ) we can distinguish majorana and dirac neutrinos due to different slopes of the event spectra over @xmath233 , @xmath237 .    the resonant spin precession can appear for another changing magnetic field configuration , for instance , for the _ linear -polarized alfven wave _ @xcite when a magnetic field direction ( transversal to the incident neutrino momentum ) could be fixed .",
    "however , in contrast to @xcite , this mechanism is still not elaborated for @xmath25 and @xmath238-conversions .",
    "1truecm the partially polarized electron neutrino flux provided by @xmath238 conversions within the sun can give an opportunity to distinguish majorana and dirac neutrinos in the borexino and in the hellaz experiments due to quite different profiles of recoil electron spectra(fig.1 - 3 ) .",
    "notice that measurements of @xmath239 and @xmath240 would allow authors of the project@xcite to determine the neutrino energy @xmath203 .",
    "the inclusion of other neutrino fluxes with the different @xmath241 is necessary for comparison with real electron spectra although we expect the same qualitative difference of the spectra for the majorana and the dirac cases .",
    "really , it is obvious that @xmath242 exceeds @xmath243 in a wide energy region due to additional interaction of right - handed _ active _ majorana neutrinos with electrons in contrast to the _ sterile _ @xmath244 .",
    "probably , in the superkamiokande or in the sno detectors this difference can be marked too . in spite of unknown dependence of the survival probability @xmath245 on the incident neutrino energy @xmath203 both the differential @xmath229 and the total @xmath246 cross - sections averaged over the boron neutrino spectrum @xmath247@xcite",
    "should have quite different slopes depending on @xmath239 or @xmath233  .",

    "( [ weak2 ] ) over the spectrum @xmath247@xcite .",
    "the absolute value of the averages @xmath229 , @xmath246 changes when @xmath249 varies that corresponds to some different levels of the electron neutrino deficit .",
    "meanwhile both sets of lines ( for majorana or dirac neutrinos ) conserve different slopes for the two kinds of particles .    another model independent way to distinguish majorana and dirac neutrinos was proposed in @xcite .",
    "authors @xcite showed that nc events at the sno detector would not oscillate over time for @xmath19 and would oscillate in the case of @xmath20 .",

    "a changing magnetic field @xmath251 influences neutrino flux variations so that one predicts @xmath252 for @xmath19 and @xmath253 for @xmath20 .      in conclusion , without any knowledge of solar magnetic field direction and even for a magnetic moment obeying the astrophysical constraint @xmath257",

    "in this case the spectra @xmath255 will be displaced parallel to the initial one without change of a slope in the contrary to the spectra @xmath256 that should change its slope .",
