    "the measurement of the mass of the w boson ( ) is one of the principal goals of the physics programme undertaken with the lep  collider at cern . within the standard model of electroweak interactions ,",
    "the w mass can be inferred indirectly from precision measurements of electroweak observables , in particular from @xmath92 events at centre - of - mass energies ( ) close to the peak of the z resonance ( around 91gev ) , studied extensively at lep1 and sld @xcite .",
    "these measurements currently give a prediction for  with an uncertainty of 32mev , or 23mev if the measurement of the mass of the top quark from the tevatron @xcite is also taken into account .",
    "direct measurements of the w mass with a similar precision are therefore of great interest , both to test the consistency of the standard model and better to constrain its parameters ( for example the mass of the so - far unobserved higgs boson ) , and to look for deviations signalling the possible presence of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "such measurements became possible at lep once the centre - of - mass energy was raised above 160gev in 1996 , allowing the production of pairs of w bosons in the reaction @xmath0 .",
    "measurements of the width of the w boson ( ) can also be carried out at lep , providing a further test of the consistency of the standard model .",
    "this paper presents the final opal measurement of the mass and width of the w boson , using direct reconstruction of the two boson masses in @xmath93 and  events recorded at  collision energies between 170gev and 209gev .",
    "the result for is combined with a measurement using direct reconstruction in the  final state @xcite and a measurement from the dependence of the ww production cross - section on  at @xmath94gev @xcite .",
    "this paper supersedes our previous results @xcite obtained from the data with @xmath95170189gev .",
    "three methods are used in this paper to extract , all based on similar kinematic fits to the reconstructed jets and leptons in each event .",
    "the principal method , the convolution fit , is based on an event - by - event convolution of a resolution function , describing the consistency of the event kinematics with various w boson mass hypotheses , with a breit - wigner physics function dependent on the assumed true w boson mass and width .",
    "the convolution fit is used to obtain the central results of this paper , but is complemented by two other fit methods of slightly lower statistical precision : a reweighting fit based on fitting monte carlo template distributions with varying assumed w mass and width to the reconstructed data distributions , and a simple analytic breit - wigner fit to the distribution of reconstructed w boson masses in the data .",
    "complete analyses , including systematic uncertainties , have been performed for all three methods , providing valuable cross - checks of all stages of the analysis procedure .",
    "the convolution and reweighting fits also measure the w width ; the convolution fit is again used for the central results , and the reweighting fit provides a cross - check including all systematic uncertainties .",
    "the breit - wigner fit does not measure the w width , but an additional independent convolution - based method is used to provide a second statistical cross - check in the  channel .",
    "the dominant systematic error in the  channel comes from possible final - state interactions ( colour reconnection and bose - einstein correlations ) between the decay products of the two hadronically decaying w bosons . according to present phenomenological models , these interactions mainly affect soft particles , and the uncertainties can be reduced by removing or deweighting soft particles when estimating the directions of jets .",
    "such a method is used for the  channel measurements of  from all three fit methods in this paper .",
    "conversely , the effect of final - state interactions can be enhanced by giving increased weight to soft particles , and this is used to place constraints on possible colour reconnection effects .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . the opal detector , data and monte carlo samples are introduced in section  [ s : dmc ] , followed by a brief description of the event selection in section  [ s : evtsel ] .",
    "elements of the event reconstruction and kinematic fitting common to all three analysis methods are discussed in section  [ s : reckin ] , followed by a detailed description of the individual convolution , reweighting and breit - wigner fits in sections  [ s : cvfit][s : bwfit ] .",
    "systematic uncertainties , which are largely common to all three methods , are described in section  [ s : syst ] .",
    "finally the results are summarised in sections  [ s : results ] and  [ s : conc ] .",
    "a detailed description of the opal detector can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "tracking of charged particles was performed by a central detector , enclosed in a solenoid which provided a uniform axial magnetic field of 0.435 t .",
    "the central detector consisted of a two - layer silicon microvertex detector , a high precision vertex chamber with both axial and stereo wire layers , a large volume jet chamber providing both tracking and ionisation energy loss information , and additional chambers to measure the @xmath96 coordinate of tracks as they left the central detector . along the @xmath97 beam direction and @xmath98 pointing towards the centre of the lep ring .",
    "the polar and azimuthal angles are denoted by @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and the origin is taken to be the centre of the detector . ]",
    "together these detectors provided tracking coverage for polar angles @xmath101 , with a typical transverse momentum ( @xmath102 ) resolution is used throughout this paper .",
    "] of @xmath103 with @xmath102 measured in gev .",
    "the solenoid coil was surrounded by a time - of - flight counter array and a barrel lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter with a presampler .",
    "including also the endcap electromagnetic calorimeters , the lead - glass blocks covered the range @xmath104 with a granularity of about @xmath105 in both @xmath99 and @xmath100 . outside the electromagnetic calorimetry , the magnet return yoke was instrumented with streamer tubes to form a hadronic calorimeter , with angular coverage in the range @xmath106 and a granularity of about @xmath107 in @xmath99 and @xmath108 in @xmath100 .",
    "the region @xmath109 was instrumented with an additional pole - tip hadronic calorimeter using multi - wire chambers , having a granularity of about @xmath110 in @xmath99 and @xmath111 in @xmath100 .",
    "the detector was completed with muon detectors outside the magnet return yoke .",
    "these were composed of drift chambers in the barrel region and limited streamer tubes in the endcaps , and together covered 93% of the full solid angle .",
    "the integrated luminosity was evaluated using small angle bhabha scattering events observed in the forward calorimeters @xcite .",
    "the data used for this analysis were taken at centre - of - mass energies between 170gev and 209gev during the lep2 running period from 1996 to 2000 , and correspond to a total integrated luminosity of about 689 . in the year 2000",
    ", lep was operated in a mode where the beam energy was increased in @xmath112gev steps during data taking several times in each collider fill .",
    "data taken during these ` miniramps ' ( approximately 1% of the total year 2000 data sample ) are excluded from the analysis as the beam energy is not precisely known .",
    "a detailed breakdown of the energy ranges and integrated luminosities in each year of data taking is given in table  [ t : evtsel ] .",
    "in addition , @xmath92 events recorded at @xmath113gev were used to calibrate the leptonic and hadronic energy scales and to study the modelling of the detector response by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "these events were recorded during dedicated runs at the beginning of each year , and also at intervals later in the data - taking periods to monitor the stability of the detector performance with time .",
    "they amount to a total integrated luminosity of about 13 , corresponding for example to about 400000 hadronic  decays .    .[t",

    ", the hadronisation and background uncertainties are conservatively taken to be uncorrelated between the  and  channels , and all other uncertainties are taken to be fully correlated .",
    "significant non - zero values of @xmath115 or @xmath116 could indicate that final - state interactions are biasing the values determined from the  channel ; however these values are consistent both with zero and with the shifts expected from colour reconnection in the sk  i model with @xmath117 .",
    "the result for the w mass is combined with previous opal measurements using @xmath3 events at  values between 183gev and 209gev @xcite and from the dependence of the ww production cross section on  at @xmath118gev @xcite .",
