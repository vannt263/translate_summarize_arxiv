    "a quantized vortex represents a hallmark of superfluidity @xcite .",
    "the vorticity in a superfluid clearly reveals the topological nature associated with the phase of a condensate s wave function and has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally @xcite since the first success of atomic bose - einstein condensation . in the strongly rotating limit",
    "when the number of vortices significantly exceeds the number of atoms , researchers have focused on the possibilities of observing interesting strongly correlated states @xcite .",
    "vortex states have been created experimentally relying on a variety of approaches : a spatially selective rotating rabi coupling to an auxiliary internal state @xcite , stirring inside @xcite or at the edge @xcite of a condensate with a focused laser beam , rotating a deformed trap @xcite , or simply merging several condensate pieces @xcite into a single trap .",
    "other approaches include direct phase engineering through the imprinting of a nontrivial topological phase to the wave function of a condensate @xcite using an azimuthal optical phase plate @xcite or through manipulating external magnetic ( b- ) fields @xcite .",
    "alternately , a condensate can gain angular momentum through its coupling to a laguerre - gaussian light beam @xcite or other forms of gauge potentials @xcite .",
    "the idea of phase imprinting from the nontrivial geometrical properties of external b - fields is especially illuminating as it involves no forced rotation or essentially no spatial motion @xcite .",
    "it has since been demonstrated in beautiful recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the original protocol @xcite involves an axially symmetric spinor condensate in the familiar b - field of an ioffe - pritchard trap ( ipt ) @xcite consisting of a two dimensional ( 2d ) quadrupole b - field augmented by a bias b - field along the symmetric @xmath0-axis . upon the flipping of the bias field ,",
    "the adiabatically following weak field seeking state then develops a nonzero vorticity in its spatial wavefunction @xcite .",
    "our aim is to develop this protocol into a pump mechanism capable of continuously changing the vorticity of a condensate .",
    "the naive approach of repeated flips of the @xmath0-bias b - field does not work because the second flip simply undoes the vorticity gained in the first flip , returning the condensate to the initial state .",
    "recently , mttnen , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , put forward an interesting idea that sought to break the time reversal symmetry between the first and the second flips of the bias field .",
    "their protocol starts with a 2d hexapole b - field instead of a quadrupole field for the first flip .",
    "the hexapole field is then turned off and replaced by a quadrupole one for the second flip .",
    "it is known , as in the original bias flip protocol @xcite , that the first flip can generate a proportionally higher vorticity if the quadrupole is replaced by a higher order 2d multipole such as a hexapole @xcite . repeating the two step protocols with hexapole and quadrupole b - fields in turns , mttnen , _",
    "et al . _ , show that the vorticity increases by @xmath1 per atom in the hexapole step and decreases by @xmath2 per atom during the quadrupole step @xcite .",
    "thus each cycle composed of a bias flip with a hexapole field followed by a second bias flip with a quadrupole field increases the net vorticity by @xmath3 .",
    "higher vorticities are generated with repeated cycles .",
    "a related earlier discussion @xcite suggested an even simpler protocol of turning off the quadrupole field after the first flip , and then returning the axial bias field to its original direction .",
    "the return of the axial bias to the original direction is hoped to bring the system to the initial configuration except for the vorticity gained from the first flip .",
    "it was previously noted that by turning on the quadrupole field and repeating the above protocol , a continuous vortex pump is realized @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no details were given on how the axial bias field is returned to the original direction @xcite .",
    "clearly it can not be flipped back in the absence of the quadrupole field as the @xmath0-bias field remains aligned along the same axial direction .",
    "simply let it oscillate back with the axial b - field magnitude increasing from large negative to small negative , to zero , to small positive , and then finally to large positive values does not constitute a flip . both the projections of mechanical angular momentum @xmath4 and the spin @xmath5 are independently conserved quantities during the above process .",
    "our idea is physically intuitive and leads to a direct implementation for a continuous vortex pump with the introduction of an auxiliary transverse bias b - field . as in a stern - gerlach experiment",
    ", the zeeman population distribution inside an experimental apparatus can be measured along any quantization direction of a strong reference b - field , provided the strong field is turned on adiabatically .",
    "when the transverse bias b - field is pulsed on , it provides a reference direction for the axial bias field to flip back in the absence of the quadrupole field .",
    "we find it imperative to present this result because of the high interests stimulated by the recent work of mttnen , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . unlike the ref .",
    "@xcite , our proposal requires only one set of current coils capable of generating one type of multipole b - field : be it a 2d quadrupole or a 2d hexapole .",
    "the time reversal symmetry is broken in our protocol with the extra transverse bias b - field whose presence allows for the @xmath0-bias field to rotate instead of simply oscillating back .",
    "as an illustration we consider a spin-1 condensate in an ipt , whose b - field is approximately @xmath6 near the origin .",
    "@xcite first discussed pumping vorticity into a condensate with external b - fields . for a sufficiently large @xmath0-bias b - field",
    ", a condensate of @xmath7 atoms adiabatically stays in the b - quantized @xmath8 state .",
    "after an adiabatic flip of the bias field , a vortical phase structure or a vortex state is imprinted into the condensate @xcite .",
    "the physics involved can be elucidated in terms of the symmetries and conservation laws of the model system @xcite or from the gauge potential @xcite due to the changing b - field .",
    "more specifically , it is the conservation of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) that enables a straightforward understanding of the result of isoshima , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in the axially symmetric ipt @xcite .",
    "each single flip of the bias field in the presence of a quadrupole field then imparts a @xmath11 ( for @xmath7 here ) phase winding @xcite .",

    "then simply consists of repeated applications of the above manipulations to the three b - fields : the 2d quadrupole , the axial bias , and the transverse bias fields .",
    "the potential for high fidelity operation of our pump protocol is confirmed with numerical simulations for a spin-1 atomic condensate in external magnetic ( b- ) fields . an additional optical trap @xmath14 provides a permanent confinement during the b - field manipulation . to avoid the energetic instability of the potential disintegration of a high vortex state into single vortices @xcite",
    ", we introduce an optical pinning plug @xmath15 that expels atoms away from the low b - field region to assure adiabaticity .",

    "first , we discuss the relatively relaxed conditions on adiabaticity for the manipulation of the external b - field .",
    "typically , the @xmath0-bias field is flipped over during a time of 30 ms in our numerical simulations , although we find integer numbers of vorticity are still created provided the flipping time is adjusted considerably ( shorter or longer ) . due to the symmetries and the corresponding conservation laws on the dynamics of our model system ; the conservations of @xmath97 in an ipt , @xmath98 in a 3d quadrupole trap ( qt ) and @xmath99 in a 2l - th multipole 2d b - field , high fidelity operations are assured even with marginal conditions for adiabaticity . on careful examination , we find that the aximuthal distributions of the phases are complicated , not the simple linear dependence one might have imagined . instead , the dependence on the azimuthal angle is different at a different radial coordinate , indicating a violation of the adiabatic condition with respect to the radial motional state .",

    "for instance , the loss of atoms and quantum coherence due to dissipation or decoherence strongly limit the lifetimes of all currently available atomic superfluids .",
    "if the criterion for the optimal protocol is defined as the maximal amount of vorticity gained during a fixed time , our analysis above then points to a clear winner : the repeated applications with only the hexapole field @xmath153 as evidenced by the results in the illustrated figures above .    before concluding , we want to point out that @xmath118 remains conserved within our formulation using the exact eigen - energies for the three zeeman states , which is indeed confirmed in numerical simulations .",
    "this is easily understood because the effective zeeman interaction @xmath175 with @xmath176 and @xmath177 commutes with @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , @xmath4 is also conserved during the @xmath76 ms intervals when only a uniform b - field is present .     for a hexapole ( @xmath173 the upper blue curve ) and a quadrupole ( @xmath151 the lower red curve ) .",
    "@xmath178 ms is the time of flipping . in the first 30 ms @xmath167",
    "is turned on to gain vorticity , while no vorticity is gained in the following 10 ms when a transverse bias along the @xmath51-axis is turned on to reset the internal states to be as they were initially .",
    "( b ) with both b - fields @xmath167 ( @xmath173 for the upper blue curve and @xmath151 for the lower red curve ) and @xmath168 available and used for the first and second steps , respectively , of each cycle .",
    "@xmath179 ms is the total time for each cycle . in the first 30 ms",
    "@xmath167 is present and in the next 30 ms @xmath168 is turned on while @xmath167 is turned off .",
    "the vorticity increases at all times in this case .",
    "the dashed lines in two figures are guides for the eye.,width=326 ]",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed and demonstrated numerically a simple yet efficient vortex pump protocol capable of continuously increasing or decreasing the vorticity of a condensate through repeated manipulations of external b - fields : a bias along the axial direction , a 2d quadrupole field or hexapole field , and a 3d quadrupole field or a transverse bias field . based on a general consideration of the geometrical properties of static b - fields",
    ", we have shown that the above choices of b - fields are the only possibilities capable of continuously controlling angular momentum vorticity in a spinor condensate through the manipulation of b - fields . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we compare the two optimal protocols for continuously increasing vorticity for the first five repetitions .",
    "the vorticity is seen increasing to @xmath180 and @xmath181 by using only @xmath167 for a hexapole ( @xmath173 ) and a quadrupole ( @xmath151 ) , respectively , in ( a ) , and to @xmath182 and @xmath180 by combining both @xmath167 and @xmath168 for @xmath173 and @xmath151 , respectively , in ( b ) . to assure adiabaticity throughout the b - field manipulations , each cycle has to be engineered differently in the two protocols .",
    "for the first protocol as shown in ( a ) , the duration for each cycle , or its period is @xmath178 ms . during the first 30 ms we use @xmath167 to increase vorticity , and in the following 10 ms the transverse bias along the @xmath51-axis",
    "is turned on to reset to the initial internal state through a second @xmath0-bias flip . for the second protocol of ( b ) , the period required becomes @xmath179 ms . during the first 30 ms",
    "@xmath167 is present and in the following 30 ms @xmath168 is turned on while @xmath167 is turned off .",
    "our discussions indicate that for @xmath151 , the second protocol is more efficient if a maximal amount of vorticity is sought . while for @xmath173 , our results show that the efficiencies for the two protocols are about the same due to the different time requirements for adiabaticity . based on the experience from the numerical simulations and from experimental works",
    ", it seems more practical to use the first protocol .",
    "the reason is rather simple , it is always more difficult to have two types of magnetic traps ( from two sets of current carrying coils ) working together .",
    "the first protocol requires only one type of multipole 2d b - field @xmath183 , that can be realized on an atom chip @xcite , using a three- or four - wire structure for a 2d qt @xcite , or a five - wire structure for a 2d hexapole trap @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate above the practical limit of reaching @xmath184 per atom using our protocol , which is already much larger than anything reported experimentally through the stirring of a condensate .",
    "we do not know what the maximum limit is .",
    "in fact , the exact value of this maximum is perhaps not so important either for two reasons : 1 ) , our theory is mean field and may well break down at such larger angular momentum per atom because quantum correlations become essential ; 2 ) , we are also limited by the computational resources available for such large scale simulations .",
    "the prospect for realizing the proposed vortex pump mechanism provides new impetus to active pursuits of quantum simulations of strongly interacting many body electronic systems in terms of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "it opens new avenues of theoretical and experimental research into the coupling between the internal and motional degrees of freedom and shines new light on relevant topics in spintronics studies @xcite .",
    "finally we note that in all our protocols discussed above , there always exist a conserved quantity @xmath118 for the ideal case of the model system . to create a vortex , one simply needs to adiabatically flip the b - field to transfer all atoms from the weak field seeking zeeman state @xmath185 to @xmath186 , or the reverse .",
    "an obvious connection can be made with the famous einstein - de haas effect to deepen the understanding of our protocol and to possibly extend to the systems of dipolar quantum gases @xcite . during our extensive numerical simulations",
    ", we find that a small b - field gradient @xmath64 or @xmath82 , combined with a stronger optical plug enforces the stability of the high vorticity states as generated .",
    "as is well known high - order multipole b - field traps are usually not ideal candidates for magnetic traps because they are too weak to trap atoms .",
    "as far as vortex pump is concerned , however , a hexapole trap is preferred over a quadrupole trap because we are making use the topological structure of the b - field , rather than its spatial dependence when trapping is considered .    to help with further experimental effort",
    ", we suggest a feasible implementation scheme on an atom chip .",
    "as is well known , an ipt can be realized by combing a chip based @xmath187-type trap with a constant b - field @xcite .",
    "this type of ipt is not an ideal setup for implementing our protocols because the locations of trap zeros at the vanishing b - field change following increasing or decreasing currents in the on chip wires .",
    "the ipts from the more stable three- or four - wire structures , on the other hand , are more promising candidates as evidenced by their demonstrated successes and stabilities in our chip matter wave manipulations @xcite .",
    "for the three - wire structure , three equally spaced parallel wires lay on the surface of an atom chip , with the current in the middle wire opposite to the other two side wires .",
    "the four - wire structures are analogously configured .",
    "following similar ideas , a two - dimensional hexapole trap can be constructed by five wires @xcite .",
    "additionally these chip - based traps can be combined with optical traps , such as an optical plug , to realize a rich variety of confinement geometries .",
    "the force of gravity can be made to align along any of the symmetry axes of the two - dimensional multipole trap or compensated with an additional optical confinement ."
