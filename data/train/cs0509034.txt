    "this simple poset plays an important role in the algorithmic of posets @xcite .",

    "was presented an approach for drawing @xmath1 -free posets .",
    "the algorithm , called _ lr - drawing _ ( lr for left - right ) , consists of three steps : the first step is to convert @xmath2 into an @xmath1-free poset @xmath56 . the second step is to apply the lr - drawing to @xmath56 .",
