    "chiral symmetry plays an important role in low energy of qcd , where the lightness of pions is because they could be the nambu - goldstone bosons of the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry .",
    "however , it is explicitly broken in _",
    "qcd by non - zero quark masses .",
    "in particular , the mass of the strange quark should be treated as large in contrast to those of the up and the down quarks .",
    "the original proposal of the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite , which respects the chiral symmetry , is a holographic dual of massless qcd .",
    "its quark - mass deformations have also been considered : a way is to use worldsheet instantons @xcite ( see also @xcite)-branes @xcite . ] . in this paper , we focus on baryons with strangeness as a massive flavor in the sakai - sugimoto model .",
    "let us recall that , in the context of the skyrme model , there is an approach known as the bound - state approach to strangeness @xcite .",
    "it is useful in the case that strangeness is dealt with as a massive flavor .",
    "the idea is to consider a kaon around a two - flavor skyrmion , and then their bound - state is identified as a hyperon .",
    "there is a problem that they are somewhat strongly bound such that hyperon masses are lower than those obtained in experiments , but the approach seems to work well .",
    "we would like to consider this idea in the sakai - sugimoto model , where baryons are identified as instanton - like solitons @xcite .",
    "the soliton solution of the model has been studied in detail in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we focus on kaon fluctuation here as a simple attempt to the bound - state approach",
    ". this attempt should be different from the collective coordinate quantization of three flavor baryons @xcite , in which case mass shifts of baryon spectra in the presence of quark masses have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "our study may rather be related to meson - baryon scatterings such as @xmath1-@xmath2 scatterings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : kaon ] , we consider kaon fluctuation around the baryon as the background of the model . here for simplicity we try to use a canonical kaon mass term . in section [ sec : mass ] , we consider the quark - mass term introduced by @xcite . this mass term should be a proper one to be used instead of the one used in section [ sec : kaon ] , while we will see that its contribution is minor here . in section [ sec : summary ] ,",
    "we summarize , and briefly discuss a possibility to take vector mesons into account .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite is a five - dimensional gauge theory , in which kaluza - klein(kk)-decomposed gauge fields are mesons and baryons are provided by its solitons .",

    "a four - dimensional action of @xmath48 gives a starting point of our bound - state approach .",

    "we will consider a quark mass term which is precisely introduced to the sakai - sugimoto model separately in the next section .    since we have the four - dimensional action , we may simply trace the analysis of @xcite .",

    "we shall consider two cases of @xmath84 : @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "in @xcite , the former case corresponds to @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , while the latter case did @xmath0 ; for details , see the papers .",
    "such identification was because the bound - states could be found , and the spectra were nicely interpreted as those baryons . relying on the observations , we now search whether there are bound - states in such two cases .    solving the eigenvalue problems ,",
    "we find no bound - state in the @xmath85 case , while a weak bound - state can be found in the @xmath86 case with @xmath90 mev . in the former case , @xmath83 is strongly repulsive opposite to the skyrme model case , where the potential are strongly attractive and favor a bound - state . in the latter case ,",
    "the potential is still repulsive ( see figure [ fig : pot ] ) .",
    "however , in practice @xmath57 in gives seemingly large contribution which forces kaon wavefunction localize at the slight minimum of @xmath83 in this case .",
    "we concern that this may be a numerical artifact of the baryon solution of the sakai - sugimoto model because @xmath34 , which should have been of order @xmath91 and small , is in fact large due to the numerical factor appearing in it .",
    "it seems that our bound - state program tries to bind a kaon and a baryon , both of which have concrete identity after that they are made from a quark - antiquark pair or @xmath11 quarks .",
    "this point may be related to a prescription where @xmath0 can be a bound - state of @xmath92 and @xmath2 .",
    "we do not step in the @xmath32 corrective coordinate quantization of the baryon @xcite although the calculation is straightforward .",
    "it will produce the mass splittings of @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 baryons , for example .",
    "since we could not obtain any bound - state corresponding in @xmath85 case , such mass splittings can not be discussed .",
    "in the previous section , the canonical kaon mass term @xmath93 was employed . however , there are precise ways to introduce quark masses by using ingredients of string theory . in this section ,",
    "we consider the quark mass term introduced in @xcite .",
    "we will see that its contribution is minor in the present case of the bound - state problem . for this reason we used @xmath93 phenomenologically in the previous section .",

    "toward the bound - state approach to strangeness in the context of the sakai - sugimoto model of holographic qcd , we considered , as a simple case of study , fluctuation which corresponds to kaon around the instanton - like baryon .",

    "there was no bound - state in the former case , while a weak bound - state was seen in the latter case although this might be a numerical artifact of the baryon solution of the sakai - sugimoto model .",
    "this would correspond to a @xmath0 described by a meson - baryon bound - state .",
    "the disparity of ours from the case of the skyrme model is in a sense apparent . in the latter case",
    ", the kaon fluctuation is smoothly connected to the @xmath123 collective coordinate quantization of the skyrmion in the chiral limit .",
    "however , as long as focusing on kaon fluctuation as in , the collective coordinate quantization of the three - flavor baryon @xcite should not be realized because all gauge field fluctuations need to be included so as to generate the instanton zero - mode .",
    "if we want to find connections to collective coordinate quantization description , it may be necessary to include also vector - mesons .",
    "in fact , a work of bound - state approach in hidden local symmetry framework @xcite , which work contained a vector - meson counterpart of kaon , could give a result similar to the case of the skyrme model .",

    "the latter may be similar to our attempt .",
    "however , dealing with vector - mesons in the case here will be far more difficult for following reasons .",
    "first , quark masses should be included in a way that mass spectra of vector - mesons can be calculated in the presence of them .",
    "secondly , effective vector meson masses should be calculated in baryon background as in section [ sec : mass ] . to obtain an effective low - energy description which will be in the same universality class of the bound - state approach in the skyrme model , all the vector mesons ( of kaons ) should be integrated out at some energy scale .",
