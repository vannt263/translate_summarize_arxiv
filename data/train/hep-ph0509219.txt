    "with the increasing precision of the experimental results , the unitarity triangle ( ut ) analysis shows the impressive success of the ckm picture in describing cp violation in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "ut parameters have been consistently determined using both cp - conserving ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) and cp - violating ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) processes @xcite .",
    "additional measurements of several combinations of angles of the ut , especially @xmath16 from @xmath17 and @xmath18 from charmless @xmath3 decays , confirm this picture @xcite .",
    "this success becomes a puzzle once , as a possible solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , the sm is considered as an effective theory valid up to energies not much higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "indeed , even in the favourable case in which the theory above the cutoff is weakly coupled , such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model , large contributions to flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) and cp - violating processes are expected to arise @xcite , clashing with the large amount of accurate experimental data now available on these transitions .",
    "this is due to the presence of additional sources of flavour and cp violation beyond the ckm matrix ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for the supersymmetry case ) .",
    "in general , the flavour puzzle admits two classes of possible solutions .",
    "the first one contains models in which a flavour symmetry is invoked to explain the hierarchy of quark masses and mixing angles .",
    "these models are based on different theoretical approaches ( supersymmetry , grand unification , extra dimensions ,   ) leading to different levels of agreement with the data and to different low - energy signals .",
    "however , low - energy processes generally receive sizable additional contributions which jeopardize the validity of the sm ut analysis ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a supersymmetric example ) .",
    "a generalized ut fit allowing for the presence of arbitrary new physics ( np ) contributions is therefore very useful for model building , since it provides at the same time the allowed ranges for the sm ckm parameters and for the np contributions to @xmath2 processes . this will be the subject of the first part of the present work ( secs .",
    "[ sec : generalut]-[sec : ds2 ] ) .",
    "the second class of solutions to the flavour puzzle contains models with minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) .",
    "the basic idea of mfv is that the only source of flavour violation is in the sm yukawa couplings , so that all fcnc and cp - violating phenomena can be expressed in terms of the ckm matrix and the top quark yukawa coupling @xcite .",
    "this leads to strong correlations between different observables , and allows for a detailed study of low - energy phenomena .",
    "while there are several implementations of mfv in different contexts ( two - higgs doublet models , supersymmetry  @xcite , extra dimensions  @xcite ,   ) , it is possible to perform two very general analyses under the mfv hypothesis .",
    "the first is the determination of the so - called universal unitarity triangle ( uut ) @xcite , which is a ut fit performed using only quantities that are independent of np contributions within mfv models .",
    "the second is a simultaneous fit of the ut and of np contributions in the @xmath2 sector .",
    "these two analyses will be presented in the second part of this work ( sec .",
    "[ sec : uut ] ) , and they serve as the starting point for the study of rare decays and cp violation in mfv models  @xcite .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : ckm2010 ] we present the possible future improvements in the above analyses by considering a `` year 2010 '' scenario for experimental data and theoretical inputs in the flavour sector .",
    "while to our knowledge the determination of the uut is presented in this work for the first time , several attempts have been previously made in the study of the ut in the presence of np .",
    "considering only model - independent analyses , in ref .",
    "@xcite the case of np contributions to @xmath19 or @xmath20 transitions was analyzed : this corresponds to the discussion in section  [ sec : ds2 ] of the present work .",

    "constraints on np in the @xmath19 sector using @xmath3 physics only were considered in refs .",
    "the determination of the ut from tree - level processes only was presented in ref .",

    "<S> starting from a ( new physics independent ) tree level determination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we perform the unitarity triangle analysis in general extensions of the standard model with arbitrary new physics contributions to loop - mediated processes . using a simple parameterization , we determine the allowed ranges of non - standard contributions to @xmath2 processes . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the recent measurements from @xmath3 factories allow us to determine with good precision the shape of the unitarity triangle even in the presence of new physics , and to derive stringent constraints on non - standard contributions to @xmath2 processes . since the present experimental constraints favour models with minimal flavour violation , we present the determination of the universal unitarity triangle that can be defined in this class of extensions of the standard model . finally , we perform a combined fit of the unitarity triangle and of new physics contributions in minimal flavour violation , reaching a sensitivity to a new physics scale of about 5 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we also extrapolate all these analyses into a `` year 2010 '' scenario for experimental and theoretical inputs in the flavour sector . </S>",
