    "the history of pure - connection formulation of general relativity ( gr ) is old , starting with works of eddington and schrdinger @xcite  see _ e.g. _ section 2 of @xcite , for a state of the art of pure - connection formulations of gravity .",
    "on the one hand , in the case of eddington ",
    "schrdinger s proposal , the connection is torsionless but admits nonmetricity off - shell .",
    "the lagrangian density is proportional to the square - root of the determinant of the ricci tensor .",
    "for dimensional reason , the lagrangian density must be divided by the cosmological constant ( we will always work in the geometric unit system : @xmath9 ) in four spacetime dimension . upon identifying the metric with the ricci tensor of the curvature for the connection divided by the cosmological constant , the field equations state that the connection is metric - compatible .",
    "clearly , this action and identification are only well - defined for a nonvanishing cosmological constant @xmath10 .",
    "the on - shell value of eddington ",
    "schrdinger s action is equal to the product of @xmath11 with the spacetime volume , as is the case for the einstein ",
    "hilbert action with cosmological constant .",
    "the palatini action plays the rle of a first - order parent action for both of these second - order actions .",
    "in fact , when @xmath10 the metric is an auxiliary field and the eddington  schrdinger action can be obtained by solving the field equation for the metric in terms of the connection inside the palatini action .",
    "+ on the other hand , gravity can also be geometrically formulated  la cartan , with vielbein ( _ i.e. _ an orthonormal frame ) and spin - connection ( _ i.e. _ a metric - compatible connection admitting torsion off - shell ) as dynamical variables .",
    "for gr with nonvanishing cosmological constant , the lagrangian density in the cartan formulation admits a yang  mills - like form , _",
    "i.e. _ quadratic in the curvature , via the macdowell ",
    "mansouri action @xcite which is also a parent action for gravity .",
    "one can in principle integrate out the vielbein so as to reach a final action that would be of pure spin - connection type . in dimensions",
    "@xmath12 , this way of proceeding is involved and , for technical reasons , does not lead to a closed expression for the fully nonlinear lagrangian density for the spin - connection .",
    "however , it can be obtained perturbatively around any solution , for instance : ( anti- ) de sitter background , as was done till cubic interaction level in the interesting paper @xcite .",
    "+ in this note we do not claim to reach the corresponding explicit form of the fully nonlinear , pure spin - connection formulation of gr with cosmological constant , but believe that the formulation we give at the linearised level is simple and suggestive enough to allow for some progress toward the searched - for action . with this goal in mind",
    ", we speculate about a possible parent action for gr that would be viewed on the same footing as the macdowell  mansouri action .",
    "+ our lagrangian takes a form that makes it immediately suited to the holographic renormalisation of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action with cosmological constant discussed in @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the resulting pure spin - connection action behaves well under quantisation .",
    "one can also put the action as the integral of a square - root featuring a self - dual two - form , upon adding the pontryagin topological invariant to the euclideanised action .",
    "+ the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we revisit the problem at the linearised level , integrating out the vielbein from the linearised macdowell ",
    "mansouri action .",
    "this leads to a quadratic lagrangian for the sole spin - connection . because we keep the gauss  bonnet term in the original macdowell ",
    "mansouri action , even in @xmath13 where it is a total derivative , we land on a new , suggestive form for the pure spin - connection quadratic lagrangian @xmath14 .",
    "it turns out to be given by a density very reminiscent to the one describing weyl s gravity . in the same section ,",
    "we show that the dual graviton in the ( anti- ) de sitter geometry ( a)ds@xmath0 transforms in a representation of @xmath1 identical to the representation carried by the dual _ massive _ graviton in flat spacetime of the same dimension @xmath15 and further explain the nature of the dual graviton in ( a)ds@xmath16 .",
    "+ the core of the paper , in section [ sec:3 ] , consists in giving a detailed proof that the resulting theory propagates only the degrees of freedom for a massless graviton on ( a)ds background .",
    "this is not obvious indeed , see e.g. @xcite where the counting of degrees of freedom was studied for quadratic - curvature - like lagrangians featuring both the spin - connection and vierbein .",
    "a recent discussion on the problem of counting degrees of freedom for pure spin - connection lagrangians can be found in @xcite . in the same section , we explain in which precise sense the field equations for the pure spin - connection action are equivalent to the zero - torsion condition , upon appropriately identifying the _ geometrical _ vielbein , function of the spin - connection , around ( a)ds .",
    "+ from the results of the previous section , in section [ sec:4 ] we speculate about a possible fully nonlinear , alternative parent action for gr .",
    "the proposed action would then be viewed on the same footing as the macdowell ",
    "mansouri action , considered as a parent action for general relativity with cosmological constant .",
    "the nonlinear lagrangian we propose reproduces the quadratic lagrangian @xmath17 to lowest order . in the same section , we add to the proposed action the pontryagin term so as to express the resulting euclideanised action as the square root of the determinant of an antisymmetric , ( anti-)selfdual two - form .",
    "we conclude the paper with a summary in section [ sec:5 ] .",

    ", we will take @xmath31 with the understanding that the results apply to ds@xmath0 upon changing the sign in front of @xmath32 .",
    "the translation - valued components of the ( a)ds@xmath0 curvature 2-form coincides with the torsion @xmath33 the above action is invariant under diffeomorphisms and local lorentz transformations , under which both the vielbein and spin - connection transform in the usual way .",
    "+ in @xmath34 , the above lagrangian density contains a total derivative , related to the gauss  bonnet invariant @xmath35 = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\int_{\\mathscr{m}_{4 } } \\epsilon_{abcd}\\ ;    { r}^{ab}(\\omega ) \\wedge { r}^{cd}(\\omega)\\ , \\ ] ] a topological invariant proportional to the euler characteristic @xmath36 .",
    "explicitly , one has @xmath37 = 16\\pi^2 \\chi({\\mathscr{m}_{4}})\\,$ ] , where @xmath38 is the lorentz curvature 2-form .",
    "therefore , in @xmath34 one can drop it and obtain the cartan ",

    "the equations of motion derived from @xmath40 $ ] are : @xmath41 and @xmath42 where the weak equality symbol @xmath43 will stand for any equality only valid when the equations of motion hold .",
    "the first set of field equations puts the torsion to zero , and provided that the components of the vierbein are invertible , allows one to express the spin connection in terms of the vierbein .",
    "the remaining field equations then provide vacuum einstein s equations with cosmological constant @xmath11 : @xmath44 as clearly recalled in @xcite , gravity in this formulation is made more similar to a gauge theory . indeed , the action amounts to a yang  mills - like action , in the sense that it is quadratic in the lorentz - valued part of the ( a)ds@xmath0 curvature 2-form .",
    "however , a crucial difference is that it is not of the yang  mills type @xmath45 but rather of the form @xmath46 .",
    "another crucial difference with respect to the usual yang ",
    "mills gauge theories is that the underlying geometry is not described in terms of a principal @xmath47-bundle , where @xmath47 is the isometry group of the maximally - symmetric spacetime , but is a cartan geometry ( see @xcite for more details ) since , among other things , the vielbein is nondegenerate . + in dimension @xmath48 , the term in the lagrangian that is quadratic in the lorentz curvature 2-form @xmath49 is no longer a total derivative , but nevertheless the linearised field equations in @xmath50 still remain equivalent to the fierz ",

    "mansouri s and weyl s actions , though intimately related to both of them since they share the same values on einstein spaces . + the nonlinear extension of the electric - magnetic duality of linearised gravity remains an important challenge since , by analogy with its spin - one counterpart , such a duality should relate weak and strong coupling regimes . in the presence of a cosmological constant , another type of duality is available between the conventional descriptions of gravity and exotic pure - connection descriptions .",
    "one can see on dimensional ground that the loop expansion in any pure - connection formulation of gravity ( eddington  schrdinger s or pure spin - connection ) is controlled by the ratio of the planck length over the cosmological scale @xmath213 . as exhibited above at linearised level , these two types of dualities are deeply intertwined , if not even two faces of the same coin . put together",
