    "thus @xmath23 represents the amount of discord consumed to during encoding .",
    "alice then gives system @xmath1 to bob and challenges him to retrieve the best possible estimate of @xmath18 from @xmath24 . to meet this challenge",
    ", bob would need to apply some decoding protocol , defined by a computational process on @xmath24 , that outputs a classical variable @xmath25",
    ". the performance of his chosen protocol is then determined by the classical mutual information @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be bob s best possible performance when he is restricted to a single local measurement on each of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and classical post - processing .",
    "let @xmath28 be bob s maximum performance when he can , in addition , implement arbitrary quantum operations between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and thus effectively optimize his performance over all possible basis measurements of the joint system @xmath29 .",

    "this equation allows as to answer the question : _ when are coherent interactions advantageous for bob _ ?",
    "( [ eqn : symmetric_relation ] ) indicates that discord indeed quantifies a resource coherent quantum interactions harness to deliver an otherwise impossible advantage .",
    "@xmath33 implies this advantage exists only when discord is consumed during the encoding process .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of this advantage is bounded above by the amount of discord consumed .",
    "in particular , should alice and bob possess no discord to begin with , i.e. , @xmath34 , there exists no discord to consume ( i.e. @xmath35 ) , and in consequence coherent interactions will be of no help to bob regardless of alice s choice of encoding .",
    "meanwhile the lower bound @xmath36 indicates that quantum advantage is guaranteed for any encoding such that the discord consumed is strictly greater the classical correlations after encoding .",
    "this is possible for any discorded @xmath0 , since there exists since there exists maximal encodings , such that @xmath37 for any @xmath0 ( see supplementary materials ) . in this scenario ,",
    "all available discord initially available is consumed , the lower and upper bounds converge , and eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : symmetric_relation ] ) reduces to @xmath38 discord therefore quantifies exactly a resource that coherent interactions can exploit .",
    "an example of maximal encoding on two qubits are the pauli operators @xmath39 chosen with equal probability .",
    "the special case where this encoding is applied to a singlet state coincides with dense coding  @xcite .",
    "coherent interactions allow bob to extract one extra bit of knowledge about which of the four unitary transformations was applied by alice .",
    "this equals the discord consumed when we encode onto the singlet state .",
    "the operational significance of discord beyond entanglement is highlighted when we repeat the above protocol on a separable discordant resource .",

    "this resource is clearly separable , and yet possesses a discord of @xmath44 .",
    "therefore coherent processing can harness the discord within this resource to extract @xmath44 extra bits of information despite the absence of entanglement .",
    "so far , we have assumed in our definition of @xmath4 that bob may choose any povm to gain information about alice s encoding .",
    "depending on context , the class of measurements , @xmath10 , that we optimize over to obtain @xmath4 is sometimes restricted to only projective measurements  @xcite ; and in the case of continuous variables , sometimes gaussian measurements  @xcite .",
    "our results can be adapted to such variants , where @xmath45 now bounds the extra advantage gained by bob if he can implement arbitrary coherent interactions , when restricted to measurements within @xmath10 .",
    "the resource based view of discord allows for an explicit class of experiments that test for the discord - induced advantage of coherent interactions . we can generate a non - entangled discordant state @xmath0 on two spatially separate subsystems by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , thus ensuring that any observed advantage of coherent interactions is due solely to discord .",
    "discord is consumed by encoding a classical variable @xmath18 on one subsystem .",
    "we attempt to estimate @xmath18 by measurement in a basis the requires coherent interaction of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "provided our estimate @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 , we can then guarantee that our interactions are indeed coherent , and allow extraction of @xmath48 bits beyond the incoherent limit .",
    "this proposal is not restricted to any particular bipartite system , or any particular encoding .",
    "it is therefore applicable to a wide range of experimental platforms .    in continuous variable ( cv ) gaussian optics , quadrature measurements can be performed at high fidelity , while the coherent interaction of separate optical modes requires only a beamsplitter @xcite .",
    "these features make the cv regime ideal for engineering a coherent quantum interaction at the precision necessary to exceed the incoherent limit .",
    "recent work has developed a theoretical framework for discord in gaussian systems where @xmath10 is the set of all gaussian measurements  @xcite .",

    "this procedure involves only locc , the resulting bipartite state is clearly separable .",

    "the line ( c ) models these observations by taking experimental imperfections into account . despite these imperfections , bob is still able to gain more information than the incoherent limit ( d ) .",
    "the shaded region highlights this quantum advantage .",
    "this advantage is more apparent if we compare bob s performance to the reduced incoherent limit when experimental imperfections are accounted for ( e ) .",

    "the encoding becomes maximal , and this tends to the discord of the original resource ( a ) .",

    ", one can verify that @xmath75 . while this protocol does not saturate eqn .",
    "[ eqn : cv_q_ideal ] , it is ideal in the limit of large discording noise , i.e. , @xmath76 . in addition , since the entire protocol involves only passive linear optics and non - squeezed sources , there exists no entanglement at any point .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] details our experimental results for bipartite resources with varying discording noise and a fixed signal variance ( normalized to the standard quantum limit ) of @xmath77 .",
    "the blue data points represent the observed values of @xmath78 .",
    "no corrections for experimental imperfections are made .",
    "provided the discording noise is sufficiently large , such that the original resource has a significant amount of discord , @xmath78 clearly exceeds the incoherent limit @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "there is a noticeable deviation between the amount of information we experimentally extract , and the theoretical prediction @xmath79 of the idealized protocol ( fig 2.b ) .",
    "this is due to experimental imperfections , which include losses , limited suppression of parasitic phase and amplitude modulations , asymmetric modulation depth , and non - ideal 50:50 beam splitter at the interference stage .",
    "when these errors are taken into account , theory and observation agree within experimental error ( fig .",
    "the shaded region then gives the observed advantage @xmath48 of coherent interactions .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] gives the experimentally observed quantum advantage for @xmath0 with varying strength of the encoded signal , @xmath55 , when the discording noise is fixed at @xmath80 normalised to shot noise .",
    "the amount of discord within the initial resource is fixed at @xmath67 ( fig 3.a ) .",
    "this quantifies the correlations shared by alice and bob that can be potentially harnessed to exhibit quantum advantage .",
    "as we increase the strength of the encoded signal , progressively more of this initial resource is consumed ( fig 3.b ) , and thus bounds how much of this discord can be potentially harnessed ( fig .",
    "in an ideal version of the decoding protocol , the advantage would increase monotonically with the signal strength ( fig .",
    "3.d ) . with our imperfect experimental setup",
    ", there is initially an increase in the observed quantum advantage for increasing signal .",
    "however , there exists a saturation point around @xmath81 , beyond which the extra theoretical gain from increased signal strength is offset by the extra experimental imperfections in encoding .",
    "this is attributed to the nonlinear response of the electro - optic modulators .",
    "when we include these imperfections within our theoretical model , observations and theory agree ( fig .",
    "in this article , we have demonstrated that coherent interactions can harness discord to complete a task that is otherwise impossible .",
    "experimental implementation of this task demonstrates that this advantage can be directly observed , even in the absence of entanglement . since the capacity to coherently interact quantum systems is essential to quantum processing ,",
    "our results indicate that some of the advantages quantum processing pertains over its classical counterpart can be attributed to its potential to harness discord .",
    "the relation between the advantage of coherent interactions and non - classical correlations has also been studied within related paradigms .",
    "the thermodynamic variant of discord , for example , characterizes the advantage of coherent interactions in energy extraction from a given quantum state @xcite .",
    "our protocol gives similar interpretation for the standard notion of discord in terms of information extraction .",
    "meanwhile , the consideration of discord in the ` mother protocol ' shows that discord quantifies the advantage of coherent interactions in undoing entangling operations between one of the parties and an ancillary system for a general class of memory - less , two party , communication protocols @xcite . by adopting the framework of the mother protocol",
    ", we may be able to demonstrate that the consumption of discord is a general resource that induces advantage in the coherent interaction between the two relevant parties .",
    "in addition , the capacity for coherent interactions that harness discord to improve performance allows potential reinterpretion of many existing protocols .",
    "if we regard our proposal as an attempt for alice to communicate the contents of @xmath18 to bob via a pre - shared resource @xmath0 , the protocol resembles a quantum one - time pad with a generic resource @xcite .",
    "discord now plays a role in measuring the amount of extra information coherent interactions can unlock . in the special case where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are entangled",
    ", this protocol corresponds to dense coding , where the additional gain in communication rates is made possible by coherent interactions that decode information within the discordant correlations .",
    "meanwhile , if we regard the task of trace estimation in ` deterministic quantum computing with one qubit ' ( dqc1 )  @xcite as bob s attempt to extract information alice has encoded within the trace of a given unitary , our protocol may shed light on where the power in dqc1 originates .",
    "these connections are worth further investigation , and may not only lead to additional insight on the role of discord within a diverse range of applications , but also indicate whether we are already harnessing discord in many existing proposals without realizing it .",

    "the information bob can extract from a state having covariance matrix in eq .",
    "[ idealcvmat ] is @xmath168",
    "in this section , we discuss the details of the experiment carried out including the hardware , implementation , processing and the sources of errors .    the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "the entire experiment uses a single 1064 nm nd : yag laser source .",
    "the light is passed through a mode cleaner cavity to provide a broadly shot - noise limited coherent light source from 0.9 mhz .    a small portion of the original light power is split to provide the two modes of the bipartite state , each passed through a pair of phase and amplitude electro - optic modulators ( eom ) .",
    "the laser source also provides a bright field as a local oscillator for homodyne detection .",
    "the homodyne efficiency of the set - up is estimated at 91% .",
    "this is limited by the quantum efficiency of the diodes ( estimated at 93% ) and typical mode - matching qualities of 98% , generally limited by the mode distortions introduced by the eom s .",
    "the detectors are electronically matched to provide a common mode rejection of 45 db .",
    "for the purposes of control of the measured quadrature , appropriate phase and amplitude modulation are introduced onto the beam .",
    "this allows us to verify the suppression of noise contributions from parasitic modulations , and its contribution to error in discerning the quadrature .",
    "typical suppression of the orthogonal quadrature is greater than 25 db .",
    "the resource state is created by displacing both modes a and b by the same magnitude both in amplitude and phase quadratures .",
    "the displacement of the phase quadrature and amplitude quadrature of modes a and b is chosen to be correlated and anti - correlated respectively .",
    "each white noise signal used is generated from a single function generator that provides a broadband white noise signal up to 10 mhz . an electronic gain and delay",
    "is then introduced on mode b to synchronise it to mode a at 3.6 mhz .",
    "magnitudes for the white noise encoded on phase and amplitude quadratures are matched to ensure the closest realisation to the ideal symmetric covariance matrix ( see equation  [ idealcvmat ] ) .",
    "two additional function generators that generate broadband gaussian white noise up to 10 mhz are used to provide the signal encoding for the amplitude and phase quadratures .",
    "the electronic resource is split , with one portion recorded , whilst the remainder is sent to the existing eom for displacement of mode a. the encoded signal variance of the phase quadrature is electronically attenuated to match the variance of the amplitude quadrature .    in the setup where coherent interactions between the subsystems are not permitted",
    ", the resource state is characterised by first measuring the amplitude quadrature of both beams and subsequently measuring the phase quadrature of both beams .",
    "for the coherent processing case , the two beams are interfered in phase on a 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "the amplitude quadrature of the bright output and the phase quadrature of the dark output are sampled using the same homodyne detectors .    for each separate homodyne detection @xmath169 data points",
    "are sampled at 20 msamp per second using a digital acquisition system .",
    "the process is repeated five times for each data point to provide sufficient statistics .",
    "each of the five data set is divided into two sets .",
    "these data is then digitally filtered to 3.6 - 3.8 mhz and then re - sampled .",
    "whilst ideally , we strive to achieve the state described by the covariance matrix in eq .",
    "[ idealcvmat ] , in practise the actual state is never such . to refine the experimental model ,",
    "we include effects of imperfect correlations , non linear transmission and modulation losses , excess noise and unbalanced beam splitter ratio .",
    "the covariance matrix of the bipartite state is a function of the input signal , input noise and the quantum noise .",
    "it can be written as @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the modulations on the amplitude ( phase ) quadratures on beams a and b written as a linear combination of eight independent inputs : the input signals for @xmath174 , @xmath175 , the input classical noise for @xmath174 , @xmath176 and the vacuum noises in @xmath174 in beam a and beam b , @xmath177 .",
    "we write @xmath178 as @xmath179 the coefficients @xmath180 and @xmath181 characterise the linear correlations between the quadrature modulations and the applied signal and noise voltages .",
    "the terms @xmath182 and @xmath183 represent the parasitic cross correlations which can be due to imperfect modulation quadrature .",
    "ideally we want these to be zero . a non zero correlation will degrade the mutual information .",
    "the terms @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the correlations between the signal and the quadrature modulation .",
    "imperfect correlation will again degrade both the resulting information for both the coherent and incoherent interaction .",
    "we also need the noise on both beams to have the same magnitudes so that they cancel each other at the beam splitter performing the coherent interaction .",
    "two other requirements to observe the maximum quantum advantage are for the noises and signals in both quadratures to have the same magnitudes .",
    "if they are not equal , the penalty incurred when doing a classical measurement will be less than one unit of shot noise . finally , the coefficients @xmath186 characterise excess noises in the quadratures . for the coherent case , we also include a small nonlinear loss that increases with the signal variance around the order of @xmath187 just before the beam splitter .",
    "this is attributed to the nonlinear response of the electro - optic modulators and gives rise to the observed plateauing of the quantum advantage in fig .",
    "the loss is simulated by propagating the covariance matrix @xmath188 through a beam splitter and tracing over the output of the vacuum port to get the new covariance matrix : @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the covariance matrix for the vacuum input and @xmath191 is the beam splitter transformation with transmission @xmath180 .",
    "@xmath192 is the covariance matrix for beam @xmath1 . in the case where coherent interactions are permitted ,",
    "the beams a and b are then propagated through an interference beam splitter with transmission coefficient @xmath193 and the relative phase between the two beams fixed at @xmath194 .",
    "the output covariance matrix is then @xmath195 where @xmath196 = @xmath197 shifts the phases of beam @xmath198 by @xmath199 with @xmath200 the homodyne efficiencies are modeled as a vacuum noise contaminating the signal .",
    "moreover , we take into account an imperfect locking angle between the local oscillator and the signal modeled as a rotation of the beam quadrature before the measurement @xmath201 and a similar expression for @xmath202 with @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "finally , tracing over the phase quadrature gives the measured output of the detectors in the coherent interaction setup @xmath205 and @xmath206 . in the incoherent interaction case",
    ", the covariance matrix @xmath188 is directly propagated through to the homodyne detection to sequentially measure both the @xmath50 and @xmath51 quadratures of both beams .",
    "the information rate without coherent interactions are then calculated using the full covariance matrix , ."
