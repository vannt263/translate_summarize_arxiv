    "then the fidelity between mcso - oscs and its original oscs is discussed . by numerical plot , it is obvious to note that the fidelity is equal to @xmath77 when @xmath0 is odd and not equal to @xmath77 when @xmath0 is even .",
    "the nonclassical properties of the state , such as sub - poissonian statistics , quadrature squeezing properties , and photocount distribution are also discussed in details .",
    "we find that mcso - oscs has more chance to exhibit sub - poissonian statistics with bigger value of @xmath2 in the area of @xmath120 .",
    "we also find that mcso - oscs can exhibit squeezing when the parameter @xmath0 is odd and the angle @xmath2 is smaller , which indicates that the subtracting photon operation is benifit to squeezing for odd @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the nonclassicality of mcso - oscs is investigated in terms of wf and the negative part volume of wf after deriving the analytical expression of wf .",
    "it is shown that the wf of the mcso - oscs always has negative values which implies the highly nonclassical properties of quantum states .",
    "the negative part volume of wf increases as @xmath0 increases when @xmath200 and parameter @xmath231 is bigger than a threshold , and increases as the value of @xmath4 increases when parameter @xmath2 is smaller than a threshold .",
    "especially , the negative part volume of wf increases with the increment of parameter @xmath168 except the case of @xmath50 .",
    "we also investigate the decoherence of the mcso - oscs in terms of the fadeaway of the negativity of wf in a thermal environment .",
    "it is shown that nonclassicality of the mcso - oscs decreases as time proceeds and the mcso - oscs reduces to the thermal state finally .",
    "it is also shown that nonclassicality is influenced by the temperature of environment , the higher the temperature is , the more rapidly the nonclassicality of the mcso - oscs is lost .",
    "we wish that our results will benefit for instructing experiments , for example , the new state would become a sufficient resource to generate a two - mode entanglement via a beam - splitter .",
