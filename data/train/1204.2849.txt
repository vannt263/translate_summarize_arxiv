    "<S> utf8bsmi    the newly discovered  @xcite alkali - intercalated iron selenide selenide superconductors a@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath3 , with a = k , rb , cs , share a set of properties that distinguish them from any of the other iron based superconductor(fesc ) families . </S>",
    "<S> their transition temperature is found to be as high as @xmath6k at ambient pressure  @xcite , high in comparison with the other 11-type chalgogenides . </S>",
    "<S> they are the first fesc on the verge of becoming an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( afm ) order has a novel block type structure with an unprecedented high transition temperature of @xmath7k and magnetic moment of 3.31@xmath8/fe  @xcite . from arpes experiments  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , only electron pockets are found and no hole pockets , seemingly ruling out the popular @xmath9 pairing scenario @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> last , but from an electronic structure point of view certainly not least , they contain significant numbers ( @xmath10 ) of fe and k vacancies ( v@xmath11 and v@xmath12 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> while the presence of these vacancies has been well accepted , their distribution is currently under debate . from the superlattice peaks in neutron diffraction studies  @xcite it is concluded that the fe vacancies form a @xmath13 superlattice with strong long - range order . on the other hand , a different scenario has been suggested for those samples which display simultaneously long range magnetic order and superconductivity , namely that of a phase separation , whereby the ordered fe vacancies only exist in one of the phases . </S>",
    "<S> some scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) measurements  @xcite conclude that the second phase contains no fe vacancies . other tem  @xcite and x - ray absorption near edge structure measurements  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite conclude that the second phase contains disordered fe vacancies .    </S>",
    "<S> an obvious puzzle emerges immediately upon examining angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as was demonstrated theoretically  @xcite , the @xmath13 superlattice of fe vacancies must induce a strong reconstruction of the fermi surface and the band structure , due to the huge scattering associated with the vacancy . however , current arpes results all show a simple electronic structure without any indication of reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> a possible solution  @xcite to this puzzle is that the regions to which arpes measurements are sensitive must contain poorly ordered fe vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> this explanation , however , is vulnerable to the potential problem that while vacancy disorder might suppress the band structure reconstruction , it may also destroy completely the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus timely to examine the physical effects of fe vacancy disorder in this class of materials .    </S>",
    "<S> the arpes experiments also reveal a peculiar behavior of the a@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath3 family . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the nominal value of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the observed fermi surfaces always contains large electron pockets in the zone corner , as if the system is strongly electron doped compared to the `` 245 '' parent compound a@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the chemical potential is shifted so much that not only do the hole pockets at the zone center submerge entirely below the chemical potential , but also a small electron pocket appears instead . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , these systems are commonly regarded as strongly electron doped , closer to a@xmath16fe@xmath3se@xmath3 ( 122 ) than 245 , without a reasonable account of the origin of the large number of extra electrons . considering the essential role of doping in the magnetism and superconductivity of these materials , </S>",
    "<S> a physical explanation of this peculiar behavior is clearly of highest importance .    in this letter , we address these two important issues by studying the influence of vacancy disorder on the alkali - intercalated fe selenides , using a recently developed wannier function based method to calculate from first principles the configuration - averaged spectral function @xmath0 of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 with disordered fe and k vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the disorder does indeed suppress the band structure reconstruction without completely destroying the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the disorder raises the chemical potential significantly , eliminating the hole pockets and enlarging the electron pockets , in excellent agreement with the arpes experiments , _ without _ adding carriers . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a microscopic explanation for the origin of the effective doping in terms of the disorder induced frequency broadenings of the bands . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find the emergence of strongly incoherent carriers . </S>",
    "<S> our result demonstrates clearly the general inapplicability of luttinger theorem in disordered systems , and suggests an alternative interpretation of existing arpes measurements .        </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of a disordered system is given by the configuration - averaged spectral function : @xmath17=@xmath18 of wannier orbital  @xcite @xmath19 , crystal momentum @xmath20 and frequency @xmath21 , in which configuration @xmath22 is weighted by its probability @xmath23 . by treating the disordered configurations within the supercell approximation , </S>",
    "<S> their spectral functions @xmath24 can be obtained directly from the supercell eigenvectors and eigenvalues , using the unfolding method  @xcite . to handle the computational cost related to the large sizes of the supercells , essential for a proper treatment of the disorder </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the recently developed wannier function based effective hamiltonian method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy hilbert space is taken in [ -6,2]ev consisting of the wannier orbitals of fe-@xmath25 and se-@xmath26 characters . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the fe and k vacancies is extracted from three dft  @xcite calculations : the clean kfe@xmath3se@xmath3 and the single vacancy supercells k@xmath27fe@xmath28se@xmath28 and k@xmath29fe@xmath30se@xmath28 . for the configurational average , </S>",
    "<S> we use 10 large supercells ( e.g. fig.[fig : fig1](b ) ) of random size , shape and orientation containing 176 atoms on average , and assume an equal probability among the configurations . </S>",
    "<S> benchmarks demonstrating the high accuracy of the effective hamiltonian method and the convergence of the configuration average against the size and the number of configurations are given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    as a reference , </S>",
    "<S> let s first re - examine the fully @xmath13 ordered 245 system that shows strong band structure reconstruction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to facilitate the comparison with arpes , figure  [ fig : fig1](c ) shows the band structures and fermi surfaces in the 1-fe brillouin zone ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the lower panel shows a very strong reconstruction of the fermi surface that bears no resemblance to the observed arpes measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strong fermi surface reconstruction is not a special property of the @xmath13 ordering , but expected to happen for other vacancy orderings  @xcite in general , due to the very strong scattering against the fe vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the top panel also shows that the whole band structure , not just the fermi surface , is reconstructed , with gap openings and complex folded features occurring everywhere in both fe and se bands . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the red bars in the middle panel indicate two large gap opening on the order of 300 - 400 mev . </S>",
    "<S> these kinds of strong reconstructions should in principle allow arpes to quantify the strength of the vacancy order , including the semiconducting samples that exhibit no fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that no such reconstruction has been reported is at odds with the strong vacancy order observed by neutron scattering  @xcite .    the configuration - averaged spectral function in fig .  [ fig : fig1](d ) confirms that strong disorder in the vacancies introduces very large incoherent scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> the fe bands now develop large linewidths in both momentum and frequency , reflecting their short mean free path and lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> more dramatically , the top of the se bands within [ -4,-2]ev even becomes unrecognizable , due to the large repulsive potential of @xmath310.6ev/0.2ev from fe / k vacancies on their 4/8 neighboring se orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , even for such a completely disordered case , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](d ) shows that the fe band structure and the fermi surface survive the strong vacancy disorder effects , displaying the characteristics of a dispersive band structure . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](d ) shows the clear suppression of the reconstruction in the band structure and the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> all the gap openings and folded features are washed out . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , other than the strong broadening effects and a clear reduction of bandwidth , the resulting band structure and fermi surfaces agree very well with those of the clean 122 system in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus provided quantitative support to the notion that the regions to which arpes measurements are sensitive must contain poorly ordered fe vacancies .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig1](d ) also shows an unexpected effect of the vacancy disorder , namely a large shift of the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the chemical potential is now @xmath31200mev above the tip of the hole pockets , and allows a small electron pocket to appear around the z point . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the electron pockets at the x / r point are much larger than the parent compounds of all families of fe - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the resulting fermi surface looks exactly like that of the heavily doped 122 system in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](e ) , in excellent agreement with the arpes measurements , even though the system actually contains _ no _ additional electrons . </S>",
    "<S> ( a luttinger count of the carrier density from the volume of the fermi surface would give the illusion of + 0.5/fe doping for this undoped system . ) </S>",
    "<S> this is a clear demonstration that luttinger theorem should never be applied to systems with strong disorder  @xcite . specifically in this case </S>",
    "<S> , our result suggests that the experimental samples showing 122 like fermi surface might not even be doped at all .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) spectral function obtained from disordered removal of fe orbitals alone ( without the impurity potentials ) ( a ) , and from the virtual crystal of the impurity potentials ( without the removal of fe orbitals ) . both show negligible effective doping in comparison with the full disordered calculation . </S>",
    "<S> ( c)(d ) illustration of microscopic mechanisms contributing to effective doping through broadening in frequency . ]    </S>",
    "<S> microscopically , this strong shift of chemical potential ( or an _ effective _ `` doping '' ) is to be distinguished from real doping , for example in the case of co substituted bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , in which the chemical potential shift is a direct consequence of the additional valence electron in the system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( this conclusion differs from the previous studies  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig2](a ) reveals more insight by ignoring the impurity potential in the calculation ( but still removing fe orbitals at the disordered vacancy sites ) . in this case , the effective doping becomes negligible , as an `` expected '' chemical potential of an undoped system is found , giving both hole and electron pockets of regular sizes . on the other hand , an average account of the impurity potential via the virtual crystal approximation ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) ) misses entirely the effective doping as well . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the strong chemical potential shift is only realized from the disordered nature of the impurity potential .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig2 ] illustrates two microscopic mechanisms that contribute to the effective doping through disorder induced broadenings in frequency . for simplicity , let s consider the broadening of the momentum independent spectral function @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> first , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c ) , when the spectral weight near the chemical potential ( within the frequency range of the broadening ) is larger below , a symmetric broadening in frequency pushes the chemical potential up . </S>",
    "<S> second , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](d ) , an asymmetric broadening skewed toward higher frequency alone does the same@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above test cases in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](a ) and ( b ) suggest that the essential mechanism in k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath3 is the aymmetric broadening resulting from the repulsive impurity potential .    without increasing the total electronic density of the system , </S>",
    "<S> the significant shift of chemical potential leads to many important physical consequences through , for example , the change of fermi velocity and the fermi wave vector , in a manner similar to real doping in regular systems without disorder . in particular , the significant suppression of phase space for long - range magnetic order around ( @xmath33,0 ) resembles very much the effect of real doping . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a natural explanation of the occurrence of a superconducting phase in this undoped system , and suggests a novel mechanism of promoting superconductivity via strongly disordered impurity potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , there have indeed been experimental observations suggesting enhancement of superconductivity via disorder in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> reference  @xcite reported that the same sample can be made superconducting / magnetically ordered through quenching / annealing . </S>",
    "<S> high pressure experiments  @xcite reported a seemingly second superconducting transition at considerably higher temperature @xmath34 at pressure above 11.5gpa , consistent with promotion of superconductivity via pressure - induced suppression of vacancy order . </S>",
    "<S> a second superconducting phase has also been recently reported at ambient pressure  @xcite .    obviously , for disordered impurities to promote superconductivity , their positive influence ( from the above effective doping or other disorder effects discussed below ) must overcome the negative influence of disorder ( for example pair - breaking or phase fluctuation scattering ) . </S>",
    "<S> this issue is intimately tied to the nature of the scatterer ( for example , magnetic or nonmagnetic , weak scattering or strong scattering regime , and so on ) and the superconductivity itself ( for example , sign changing order parameter or not , dominant amplitude fluctuation or phase fluctuation , and so on ) . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate rich physics to be revealed from future quantitative investigations along this direction .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) disorder induced spectral weight distributions , represented in the 2-fe brillouin zone , ( a ) as a function of crystal momentum @xmath20 and orbital indices @xmath19 , and at fixed crystal momenta @xmath35 and band index @xmath36 with ( b ) @xmath37zr and @xmath38 belonging to the large electron pocket in the zone corner , ( c ) @xmath39zr and @xmath40 belonging to the hole pocket leaking into the fermi surface , ( d ) @xmath39zr and @xmath41 displaying an incoherent satellite at the fermi surface and ( e ) their integrations displaying @xmath3120% loss of spectral weight due to the fe vacancies . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to account for the removal of fe orbitals in the vacancy sites . indeed , representing the spectral function in the eigenbasis @xmath42 of crystal momentum @xmath20 and band index @xmath36 of the uniform 122 system , @xmath43  @xcite , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] shows that the total spectral weights of all well - defined low - energy quasi - particle drop to @xmath310.8 , in good accordance to the 20% fe vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> as advocated previously  @xcite , such a large reduction in the spectral weight is expected to change strongly ( even qualitatively ) the standard picture of spin fluctuations  @xcite , through a significant reduction of the bare susceptibility by roughly a factor of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the general argument  @xcite of suppression / resilience of phase space of antiferromagnetic / superconducting order should remain valid , which leads to a potential promotion of superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our result reveals strong incoherent features in this system . </S>",
    "<S> for example , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](c ) illustrates that small amount of diffusive hole carriers in the system are still present in this seemingly highly electron doped system , through the long tails of the hole bands . </S>",
    "<S> this suggest that hole carriers could still contribute to the effective pairing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](d ) shows the presence of highly incoherent carriers right at the chemical potential , originating from the normally unoccupied band 0.5ev above the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> all of these strong effects illustrate vividly the rich physics induced by disorder , well beyond a simple modification of the band filling or dispersion .    finally , it is important to clarify that our case study with fully disordered vacancies can not correspond exactly to the real materials , since that would not be consistent with the observed superstructures from diffraction experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is instead meant to illustrate the general features of poorly ordered regions of the sample , for example , near the surface where diffusion of vacancies is easier , or in the vacancy disordered region of a phase separated sample . </S>",
    "<S> also , the vacancies are likely to be short range ordered ( sro ) , given their charged nature . furthermore , additional scattering related to short - range magnetic and orbital correlation  @xcite should also be present . while we do not expect such sros to qualitatively change our conclusions , further studies on their effects are desirable .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we studied from first - principles the normal state configuration - averaged spectral function @xmath0 of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 with disordered vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> we found that strong vacancy disorder does not destroy the band structure and fermi surface , but is able to suppress the significant band structure reconstruction expected in vacancy ordered systems , thus producing the smooth quasi - particle band structure observed by arpes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we found an intriguing disorder - induced `` effective doping '' that enlarges significantly the electron pockets to be comparable to the highly electron doped kfe@xmath3se@xmath3 , in excellent agreement with arpes observations . </S>",
    "<S> our result demonstrates clearly the general inapplicability of luttinger theorem in disordered systems , and suggests that the region to which arpes measurements are sensitive might be almost undoped after all , but with strong vacancy disorder . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the observed effective doping , together with a strong ( @xmath3120% ) loss of coherent spectral weight , offers a novel , general mechanism to promote superconductivity in the presence of strong impurity potentials , as indicated by several current experiments .    </S>",
