    "relying on quantum entanglement  @xcite , quantum communication protocols can present abilities that are unachievable by their classical counterparts .",
    "one notable example is quantum teleportation  @xcite . using two entangled qubits and 2 bits of classical communication as resources",
    ", teleportation enables alice to transmit an _ unknown _ qubit state to bob without physically transporting it .",
    "a variation of teleportation is remote state preparation ( rsp )  @xcite , wherein alice produces a _ known _ qubit state at bob s location by using entanglement and classical communication .",
    "depending on the resource requirement , preparable state ensemble , and even successful rate , different kind of rsp scheme has been devised for carrying out the specific task .    in most rsp schemes , maximal entanglement ,",
    "oftenest a bell state , is assumed to be accessible .",
    "for example , the first rsp scheme proposed by pati  @xcite uses a bell state , realizing deterministic preparation of a qubit from a fixed great circle on the bloch sphere .",
    "other later proposed schemes extended the preparable ensembles to varying degrees for preparing more general qubits , like deterministic preparations of arbitrary pure qubits  @xcite , probabilistic preparations of arbitrary qubits  @xcite , and more resently , schemes for deterministic preparations of arbitrary qubits were also implemented  @xcite . unfortunately , these mentioned schemes are unadaptable to partially entangled resource states , which may occur in the real world .",
    "to devise rsp schemes that work with partial entanglement , new ways must be found .",
    "although it is more difficult to devise rsp schemes employing partial entanglement , ye _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that , at the expense of increased classical communication , it is possible to use a partially entangled state to perform deterministic rsp of an arbitrary pure state .",
    "based on the proof , berry  @xcite proposed an explicit scheme for performing such an rsp .",
    "thus the two - dimensional case of berry s scheme provides a complete technique for preparing an arbitrary pure qubit . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also proposed an optimization procedure that can be incorporated into berry s scheme to reduce unnecessary classical communication .",
    "despite all these efforts , to our best knowledge , as yet there is no deterministic rsp scheme that use partial entanglement to prepare arbitrary ( include pure and mixed ) qubit states , which we reported here .    in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , by utilizing the ensembles that can be prepared using partial entanglement with only two bits of classical communication , we give our rsp scheme which trades off classical communication against entanglement to implement the preparation of an arbitrary qubit .",
    "our results agree with lo s conjecture on the resource cost for deterministic rsp . at the end of sec .",
    "[ secii ] we briefly summarize our scheme , and show alice can switch between this rsp and a standard teleportation without letting bob know . in sec",
    "[ seciii ] , we introduce a geometrical tool called voronoi diagram for the calculation of the classical communication requirement for our scheme .",
    "the calculation shows our scheme saves approximate 1 bit of classical communication when compared with berry s scheme for the preparation of an arbitrary pure qubit . the underlying cause of the resource saving will be explained . in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we present a remote state preparation ( rsp ) scheme for alice to prepare an arbitrary qubit state at bob s location deterministically .",
    "the resources for performing this task are a partially entangled two - qubit state and finite bits of classical communication from alice to bob .",
    "the qubit to be prepared is known to alice but unknown to bob .",
    "furthermore , we restrict the scheme to be oblivious , where the state to be prepared is known to alice but unknown to bob .    the initial setup of our rsp scheme is as follows .",
    "assume alice and bob have shared an entangled resource state in the form @xmath0 or , equivalently , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "any entangled pure two - qubit state can be brought to this form via local unitary operations .",
    "the entanglement of @xmath4 is quantified by the von neumann entropy of either of @xmath4 s reduced states , namely , @xmath5 the scheme starts by a positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) on alice s system a. the measurement operators given by @xmath6 where the superscript @xmath7 denotes the transposition , and the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are to be determined later . by implementing this povm , alice obtains a measurement outcome @xmath10 with probability calculated as @xmath11 , and the corresponding state of bob s post - measurement system will be @xmath12 .",
    "then , based on the obtained measurement result @xmath10 , alice instructs bob to apply a corresponding unitary operation @xmath13 on his system by sending him 2 bits .",
    "the unitary operation @xmath13 is chosen from @xmath14 , which is a unitary opertation set duplicated purposely from a standard teleportation scheme , as we will discuss at the end of the section .",
    "also , in order to transform bob s system to a state deterministically , we make a convention that all @xmath15 are equal .",
    "now , based on the above setup , we give the preparable ensemble of pure qubits in theorem  [ theorem1 ] .",
    "this ensemble will be generalized to include mixed qubits by corollary .",
    "[ corollary1 ] .    using a preshared resource state @xmath16 given by eq .",
    "( [ eqresource ] ) and 2 bits of classical communication from alice to bob , any pure qubit from the ensemble @xmath17\\cup[\\pi -\\theta _ r,\\pi]\\bigg\\}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] can be remotely prepared .",
    "particularly if @xmath4 is a maximal entangled state , the above ensemble is represented by the entire bloch sphere consisting of every pure qubit .",
    "[ theorem1 ]    assume the pure qubit that alice wants to prepare is expressed as @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the polar and azimuthal angles of @xmath21 in the bloch sphere representation .",
    "for bob , before he receives the 2 classical bits from alice , his system is in the state @xmath22 substitute @xmath23 with @xmath24 into eq .",
    "( [ eqsystemb ] ) , we obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 . moreover , for a legitimate povm in eq .",

    "( [ eqcondition ] ) can be used as the necessary and sufficient condition for checking the preparablity of a pure qubit @xmath21 ( also see eq .",
    "( 3 ) in ref .",
    "it is easy to see , as long as @xmath30 , eq .",
    "( [ eqcondition ] ) is soluble for non - negative @xmath31 , @xmath32 with @xmath29 . except for @xmath33 , where @xmath31 can be any value in @xmath34 $ ] , the universal solution to eq .",
    "( [ eqcondition ] ) is @xmath35 for consistency , we only use the universal solution in the follow discussion .    on the bloch sphere , the ensemble of states that satisfies @xmath30",
    "is represented by an antipodal pair of spherical caps with @xmath36\\cup[\\pi -\\theta _ r,\\pi]$ ] .",
    "particularly when @xmath4 is maximally entangled , we have @xmath37\\cup[\\pi/2,\\pi]$ ] , which means the ensemble is represented by the entire bloch sphere consisting of every pure qubit .",
    "a mixed qubit describes a two - dimensional quantum system whose state is not completely known .",
    "one can suppose such a system is in a pure qubit state @xmath21 with probability @xmath38 and in the maximally mixed qubit state with probability @xmath39 .",
    "the density matrix for such a mixed qubit can be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 here @xmath38 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 uniquely identify the bloch vector @xmath42 which is related to the position of @xmath43 in the bloch ball .",
    "when @xmath44 , @xmath45 degenerates into a pure qubit @xmath21 , while from the pure @xmath21 to the mixed @xmath45 , the bloch vector shrinks by a factor @xmath38 . one can verify , if alice sends bob totally random classical bits ( 00 , 01 , 10 or 11 each with probability 1/4 ) , bob s system will end up with the maximally mixed qubit represented by the density matrix @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , if alice wants to remotely prepare @xmath45 , she only needs to replace the bits used for preparing @xmath21 by totally random bits with probability @xmath39 .",
    "obviously we have the following corollary .    using a preshared resource state @xmath16 given by eq .",
    "( [ eqresource ] ) and 2 bits of classical communication from alice to bob , any qubit state from the ensemble @xmath47 , \\phi _",

    "particularly if @xmath4 is maximally entangled , the above ensemble is represented by the entire bloch ball consisting of every pure and mixed qubit .",
    "[ corollary1 ]    lo  @xcite conjectured that , with unlimited entanglement resource , deterministic preparation of an arbitrary pure qubit at bob s location requires @xmath48 bits of classical communication .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proved in a more restricted condition , where bob is restricted to perform a unitary operation and is oblivious to the prepared state , the rsp must use at least 2 bits of classical communication .",
    "our setup meets this condition , because when @xmath4 is maximally entangled we have @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( [ eqp1 ] ) , which means bob can not extract from the classical communication any information about the prepared state ( thus is oblivious ) .",
    "now , by treating theorem  [ theorem1 ] and corollary  [ corollary1 ] as complements to bennet _",
    "s proof , we know 2 bits of classical communication are both necessary and sufficient ( even for preparing an arbitrary qubit ) .    due to the strictly increasing relation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , a less entangled @xmath4 will lead to smaller preparable ensembles in theorem  [ theorem1 ] and corollary  [ corollary1 ] . in the following discussion",
    ", we show how to trade off classical communication for reduced entanglement to enable preparation of an arbitrary target qubit @xmath52 .",
    "we use @xmath53 to denote the spherical cap lying at the north pole mentioned in theorem  [ theorem1 ] , and @xmath54 the antipodal one .",
    "the pair of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "the size of @xmath55 can be directly measured by the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath4 is partially entangled , then @xmath55 will not cover the entire bloch sphere . in order to prepare a target state @xmath52 with bloch vector @xmath56 outside the convex hull of @xmath55 ,",
    "alice and bob need to proceed as follows .",
    "first , before the preparation begins , they need to determine a @xmath57-element rotation operation set @xmath58 that is dependant on @xmath4 .",
    "then , alice deliberately prepares the intermediate state @xmath59 , whose bloch vector is inside the convex hull of @xmath55 . by sending bob @xmath60 bits",
    ", alice instructs him to use @xmath61 from @xmath58 to transforms his system into @xmath52 .",
    "the effect of a rotation operation on a state is to rotate the state s bloch vector by a fixed angle about some axis of the bloch ball .",
    "let s suppose each @xmath61 maps the spherical cap @xmath53 to @xmath62 ( and thus @xmath54 to @xmath63 ) .",
    "although the position of @xmath64 may vary , all of them are the same size as @xmath55 and the union of @xmath65 must cover the entire bloch sphere . as pointed out earlier , if @xmath51 is reduced , the size of @xmath64 will decrease too .",
    "this generally results in an increased classical communication cost as @xmath57 tends to become larger to ensure total coverage .",
    "the resource trade - off is inevitable for an rsp scheme of this type , but making @xmath65 uniformly distributed can avoid overcommunication .",
    "the problem of how to uniformly distribute @xmath65 can be rephrased as how to construct uniformly distributed @xmath66 points with antipodal symmetry on the bloch sphere , for we can use these points as the spherical caps centers .",
    "the points construction method we use has been put into appendix .",
    "now we summarize our scheme for remote preparation of an arbitrary qubit @xmath52 as the two - stage procedure below .",
    "stage 1 . using the povm  ( [ eqpovm ] ) and the unitary operations @xmath67 to prepare an intermediate state @xmath59 that belongs to the ensemble given in corollary  [ corollary1 ] .",
    "the classical communication cost here is 2 bits .",
    "if @xmath4 is maximally entangled , by setting @xmath68 , @xmath52 can be prepared within this stage .",
    "if @xmath4 is non - maximally entangled , bob performs @xmath61 from the predefined set @xmath58 to transform @xmath43 to @xmath52 .",
    "the classical communication cost in this stage is @xmath60 bits , which is traded off against @xmath51 .",
    "different from rsp , teleportation can only be carried out when a maximally entangled resource state is available  @xcite . in a standard teleportation scheme , where a bell state @xmath69 is used ,",
    "bob needs to apply a unitary operation chosen from @xmath14 after he receives the outcome of alice s bell basis measurement .",
    "the same unitary operation set is used in our rsp scheme .",
    "as we have said , this choice is made on purpose , because one can see when @xmath4 is maximally entangled , i.e. , @xmath70 , regardless of the target state the probability that bob uses any one of these unitary operations in both schemes is always 1/4 .",
    "there is no chance for bob to tell which scheme is being performed , alice can switch between teleportation and rsp unilaterally .",
    "the total classical communication cost for our scheme is @xmath71 bits . for a given @xmath57 , the entanglement of the resource state @xmath4 can not below a certain lower bound ,",
    "otherwise there always exist some unpreparable qubit states for our scheme . to calculate the lower bound of @xmath51 , we need to make use of a geometry tool called _",
    "voronoi diagram_. a voronoi diagram is a partition of a space into regions based on distance to some specific points called sites .",
