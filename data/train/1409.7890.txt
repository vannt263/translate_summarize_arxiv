    "let s start with a game : `` hex '' is a board game for two players , invented by the ingenious danish poet , designer and engineer piet hein in 1942 @xcite , and rediscovered in 1948 by the mathematician john nash @xcite who got a nobel prize in economics in 1994 ( for his work on game theory , but not really for this game  ) .",
    "hex , in hein s version , is played on a rhombical board , as depicted in the figure .",
    "@xmath0    the rules of the game are simple : there are two players , whom we call white and black .",
    "the players alternate , with white going first .",
    "each move consists of coloring one `` grey '' hexagonal tile of the board white resp .",
    "white has to connect the white borders of the board ( marked @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) by a path of his white tiles , while black tries to connect @xmath3 and @xmath4 by a black path .",
    "they ca nt both win : any winning path for white separates the two black borders , and conversely .",
    "( this is nt hard to prove  however , the statement is closely related to the jordan curve theorem , which is trickier than it may seem when judged at first sight : see exercise  [ exer : jct ] . )    however , here we concentrate on the opposite statement : there is no draw possible  when the whole board is covered by black and white tiles , then there always is a winner .",
    "( this is even true if one of the players has cheated badly and ends up with much more tiles than his / her opponent !",
    "it is also true if the board is nt really `` square , '' that is , if it has sides of unequal lenghts . )",
    "our next figure depicts a final hex position  sure enough one of the players has won , and the proof of the following `` hex theorem '' will give us a systematic method to find out which one .",
    "@xmath5    [ the hex theorem ] if every tile of an @xmath6-hex board is colored black or white , then either there is a path of white tiles that connects the white borders @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or there is a path of black tiles that connects the black borders @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our plan for this section is the following :    we give a simple proof of the hex theorem .",
    "we show that it implies the brouwer fixed point theorem ,    and even conversely : the brouwer fixed point theorem implies the hex theorem .",
    "then we prove that one of the players has a winning strategy .",
    "and then we see that on a square board , the first player can win , while on an uneven board , the player with the longer borders has a strategy to win .",
    "all of this is really quite simple , but it nicely illustrates how a topological theorem enters the analysis of a discrete situation .    we follow a certain path _ between _ the black and white tiles that starts in the lower left - hand corner of the hex board on the edge that separates @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "whenever this path reaches a corner of degree three , there will be both colors present at the corner ( due to the edge we reach it from ) , and so there will be a unique edge to proceed on that does have different colors on its two sides .",
    "@xmath7 our path can never get stuck or branch or turn back onto itself : otherwise we would have found a vertex that has one or three edges that separate colors , whereas this number clearly has to be even at each vertex .",
    "thus the path can be continued until it leaves the board  that is , until it reaches @xmath2 or  @xmath4 .",
    "but that means that we find a path that connects @xmath1 to  @xmath2 , or @xmath3 to @xmath4 , and on its sides keeps a white path of tiles resp .  a black path .",
    "that is , one of white and black has won !    now this was easy , and ( hopefully ) fun .",
    "we continue with a re - interpretation of the hex board  in nash s version  that buys us two drinks for the price of one :    * a @xmath8-dimensional version of the hex theorem , and * the connection to the brouwer fixed point theorem .",
    "the @xmath8-dimensional _ hex board _ is the graph @xmath9 with vertex set @xmath10 , in which two vertices @xmath11 are connected if @xmath12 .",
    "the _ colors _ for the @xmath8-dimensional hex game are @xmath13 , where we identify `` @xmath14white '' and `` @xmath15black . ''",
    "the _ interior _ of the hex board is given by @xmath16 .",
    "all the other vertices , in @xmath17 , form the _ boundary _ of the board .",
    "the vertices in the boundary of @xmath9 get preassigned colors",
    "@xmath18    @xmath19    our drawing depicts the @xmath20-dimensional hex board @xmath21 , which represents a dual graph for the @xmath22-board that we used in our previous figures , with the preassigned colors on the boundary .",
    "the @xmath8-dimensional hex game is played between @xmath8 players who take turns in coloring the interior vertices of @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath23-th player _ wins _ if he achieves a path of vertices of color @xmath23 that connects a vertex whose @xmath23-th coordinate is @xmath24 to a vertex whose @xmath23-th coordinate is @xmath25 .",
    "there is no draw possible for @xmath8-dimensional hex : if all interior vertices of @xmath26 are colored , then at least one player has won .",
    "the proof that we used for @xmath20-dimensional hex still works : it just has to be properly translated for the new setting .",
    "for this we first check that @xmath9 is the graph of a triangulation @xmath27 of @xmath28^d$ ] , which is given by the _ clique complex _ of  @xmath9 : that is , a set of lattice points @xmath29 forms a simplex in @xmath27 if and only if the points in @xmath30 are pairwise connected by edges .",
    "( to check this , verify that each point @xmath31^d$ ] lies in the relative interior of a unique simplex , which is given by @xmath32    &   &       \\lfloor x_i - x_j\\rfloor\\le v_i - v_j\\le\\lceil x_i - x_j\\rceil      \\mbox{\\rm~for all $ i\\neq j$}\\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our picture illustrates the @xmath20-dimensional case . )    now every full - dimensional simplex in @xmath27 has @xmath33 vertices .",
    "a simplex @xmath30 in @xmath27 is _ completely colored _ if it has all @xmath8 colors on its vertices .",
    "thus each completely colored @xmath8-simplex in @xmath34 has exactly two completely colored facets , which are @xmath35-faces of the complex @xmath27 .",
    "conversely , every completely colored @xmath35-face is contained in exactly two @xmath8-simplices  if it is not on the boundary of @xmath28^d$ ] .    with this the ( constructive ) proof that we gave before for the @xmath20-dimensional hex theorem generalizes to the following : we start at the @xmath8-simplex @xmath36 for which the facet ( @xmath35-face ) @xmath37 is completely colored .",
    "this simplex is shaded in the following figure for @xmath21 , which depicts the same final position that we considered before .",
    "@xmath38 now we construct a sequence of completely colored @xmath8-dimensional simplices that starts at  @xmath39 : we find the second completely colored @xmath35-face of @xmath39 , find the second completely colored @xmath8-simplex it is contained in , etc .",
    "thus we find a chain of completely colored @xmath8-simplices that ends on the boundary of @xmath40^d$]at a different simplex than the one we started from .",
    "in particular , the last @xmath8-simplex in the chain has a completely colored facet ( a @xmath35-face ) in the boundary , and by construction this facet has to lie in a hyperplane @xmath41 .",
    "( in fact , at this point we check that every completely colored @xmath35-simplex in the boundary of @xmath9 is contained in one of the hyperplanes @xmath42 , with the sole exception of the boundary facet of our starting @xmath8-simplex . ) and the chain of @xmath8-simplices thus provides us with an @xmath23-colored path from the @xmath23-colored vertex @xmath43 to the @xmath23-colored vertex in @xmath42 : so the @xmath23-th player wins .",
    "our drawing illustrates the chain of completely colored simplices ( shaded ) and the sequence of ( white ) vertices for the winning path that we get from it .",
    "now we will proceed from the discrete mathematics setting of the hex game to the continuous world of topological fixed point theorems . here",
    "are three versions of the brouwer fixed point theorem .",
    "[ t : brouwer ] the following are equivalent ( and true ) :    every continuous map @xmath45 has a fixed point .",
    "every continuous map @xmath46 has a fixed point .",
    "every null - homotopic map @xmath47 has a fixed point .",
    "@xmath48    ( the term _ null - homotopic _ that appears here refers to a map that can be deformed to a constant map ; see the proof below . )",
    "( br1)@xmath49(br2 ) is trivial , since @xmath50 .    for ( br2)@xmath49(br3 ) let @xmath51\\to s^{d-1}$ ]",
    "be a null - homotopy for @xmath52 , i.e. , a continuous map that interpolates between our original map  @xmath52 and a constant map , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 for all @xmath55 .",
    "from this we construct a continuous map @xmath56 that extends @xmath52 , by @xmath57 @xmath58 this map is continuous , and by ( br2 ) it has a fixed point , which must lie in the image , that is , in  @xmath59 .    for the converse , ( br3)@xmath49(br2 )",
    ", let @xmath46 be continuous .",
    "then the restriction @xmath60 is null - homotopic , since @xmath61 provides a null - homotopy .",
    "thus by ( br3 ) @xmath60 has a fixed point , hence so does  @xmath52 .",
    "finally , we get ( br2)@xmath49(br1 ) : if @xmath45 has no fixed point , then we set @xmath62 .",
    "this defines a map @xmath63 that has a fixed point @xmath64 by ( br2 ) , with @xmath65 . but this implies @xmath66 for @xmath67 , and this is impossible for @xmath64 .    in the following we use the unit cube @xmath68^d$ ] instead of the ball  @xmath69",
    ": it should be clear that the brouwer fixed point theorem equally applies to self - maps of any domain @xmath70 that is homeomorphic to @xmath69 , resp .  of the boundary @xmath71 of such a domain .",
    "if @xmath72^d\\to [ 0,1]^d$ ] has no fixed point , then for some @xmath73 we have that @xmath74 for all @xmath75^d$ ] ( namely , one can take @xmath76^d\\}$ ] , which exists since @xmath68^d$ ] is compact ) .    furthermore , any continuous function on the compact set @xmath68^d$ ] is uniformly continuous ( see e.g.  munkres @xcite ) , hence there exists some @xmath77 such that @xmath78 implies @xmath79 .",
    "we take @xmath80 ( without loss of generality ) , and then choose @xmath81 with @xmath82 .    from  @xmath52",
    ", we now define a coloring of @xmath9 , by setting @xmath83 for the interior vertices @xmath84 , where @xmath85 denotes the @xmath23th component of  @xmath52 .",
    "this is well - defined , since @xmath86^d$ ] , and thus at least one component of @xmath87 has to be at least @xmath88 in its absolute value .",
    "now the @xmath8-dimensional hex theorem guarantees , for some @xmath23 , a chain @xmath89 of vertices of color  @xmath23 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , we know @xmath92 for @xmath93 . and at the ends we of the chain know the signs :    * @xmath94^d$ ] implies @xmath95 and hence @xmath96 , and * @xmath97^d$ ] implies @xmath98 and hence @xmath99 .",
    "hence , for some @xmath100 we must have a sign change :    * @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "all this taken together provides a contradiction , since    * @xmath103    whereas @xmath104    assume we have a coloring of @xmath9 .",
    "we use it to define a map @xmath105^d\\to [ 0,n]^d$ ] , as follows : on the points in @xmath106 we define @xmath107                    & \\text{that connects $ \\vv$ to a vertex $ \\ww$ with $ w_i=0$}\\\\              \\vv-\\ee_i & \\text{if",
    "$ \\vv$ has color $ i$ , but there is no such path . }",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] if for the given coloring there is no winning path for hex , then these definitions do not map any point @xmath108 outside @xmath105^d$ ] .",
    "hence this defines a simplicial map @xmath109^d\\to [ 0,n]^d$ ] , by linear extension on the simplices of the triangulation @xmath27 that we have considered before .",
    "the following two observations now give us a contradiction , showing that this @xmath52 can not have a fixed point :    if @xmath110 is a simplex and @xmath111 is a linear map defined by @xmath112 , then @xmath52 has a fixed point on @xmath34 if and only if @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath114 are adjacent vertices , then we can not get @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "hence for each simplex of @xmath27 , all the vectors @xmath117 lie in one orthant of  @xmath118 !      1 .   in the proof of the brouwer fixed point theorem ( thm .",
    "[ t : brouwer ] , ( br2)@xmath49(br3 ) ) , we could simply have put @xmath119 .",
    "is this continuous ?",
    "so , who can win the @xmath20-dimensional hex game ?",
    "a simple but ingenious argument due to john nash , known as `` stealing a strategy , '' shows that on a square board the first player ( `` white '' ) always has a winning strategy . in the following we first define winning strategies ,",
    "then find that one of the players has one , and finally conclude that the first player has one .",
    "still : the proof will be non - constructive , and we do nt know how to win hex .",
    "so , the game still remains interesting ",
    "a _ strategy _ is a set of rules that tells a player which move to make ( i.e. , which tile to color ) for every legal position on the board .",
    "a _ winning strategy _ here guarantees to lead to a win , starting from an empty board , for all possible moves of the opponent .",
    "a _ position _ of the hex game is a board on which some tiles may have been colored white or black , together with the information who moves next ( unless all tiles are colored ) .",
    "a position is _ legal _ if it can occur in a hex game : that is , if either white moves next , and the numbers of white and black tiles agree , or if black moves next , and white has one more tile .    a _ winning position for white _ is a position such that white has a _ winning strategy _ that tells him how to proceed ( for arbitrary moves of black ) and guarantees a win .",
    "similarly , _ a winning position for black _ has a _ winning strategy _ that guarantees to lead black to a win .",
    "[ nodraw ] every ( legal ) position for hex is either a winning position for white or a winning position for black .",
    "here we proceed by induction on the number @xmath120 of `` grey '' tiles ( i.e. , `` free '' positions on the board ) .",
    "if no grey tiles are present @xmath121 , then one of the players has won  by the hex theorem .",
    "if @xmath122 and white is to move , then any move that white could make reduces @xmath120 , and thus ( by induction ) produces a winning position for one of the players .",
    "if there is a move that leads to a winning position for white , then this is really nice and great for white : this makes the present position into a winning position for white , and any such move can be used for a winning position for white .",
    "otherwise  too bad : if every possible move for white produces a winning position for black , then we are at a winning position for black already .",
    "and the same argument applies for @xmath122 if black is to move .",
    "of course , the argument given here is _",
    "much _ more general : essentially we have proved that for any finite deterministic 2-person game without a draw and with `` complete information '' there is a winning strategy for one of the players .",
    "( this is a theorem of zermelo , which was rediscovered by von neumann and morgenstern ) .",
    "furthermore , for games where a draw is possible either one player has a winning strategy , or _ both _ players can force a draw .",
    "we refer to exercise  [ ex : drawplay ] , and to blackwell & girshick @xcite .    for hex",
    ", lemma  [ nodraw ] shows that at the beginning ( for the starting position , where all tiles are grey , and white is to move ) , there is a winning strategy either for white or for black .",
    "but who is the winner ?    our first attempt might be to follow the proof of lemma  [ nodraw ] . only for the @xmath123 board",
    "this can be done :    in this drawing , you can decide for every position whether it is a winning position for white or for black , starting with the bottom row ( @xmath124 ) that has three winning positions for each player , ending at the top node ( @xmath125 ) , which turns out to be a winning position for  white .    for larger boards",
    ", this approach is hopeless ",
    "after all , there are @xmath126 final positions to classify for `` @xmath124 , '' and from this one would have work one s way up to the top node of a huge tree ( of height @xmath127 ) .",
    "nevertheless , people have worked out winning strategies for white on the @xmath128 boards for @xmath129 ( see gardner @xcite ) .    for the hex game",
    "played on a hex board with equal side lengths , white ( the first player ) has a winning strategy .",
    "assume not : then by lemma  [ nodraw ] black has a winning strategy .",
    "but then white can start with an arbitrary move , and then  using the symmetry of the board and of the rules  just ignore his first tile , and follow black s winning strategy `` for the second player . ''",
    "this strategy will tell white always which move to take . here",
    "the `` extra '' white tiles can not hurt white : if the move for white asks to occupy a tile that is already white , then an arbitrary move is o.k .",
    "for white .",
    "but this `` stealing a strategy argument '' produces a winning strategy for white , contradicting our assumption !      gale s beautiful paper @xcite was the source and inspiration for our treatment of brouwer s fixed point theorem in terms of the hex game .",

    "let @xmath183 be a fixed system of @xmath8-intervals with @xmath194 , and let @xmath195 be a suitable ( yet undetermined ) integer .",
    "the general plan of the proof is this : assuming that there is no transversal of @xmath183 of size @xmath196 , we show by a topological method that the fractional packing number @xmath197 is at least @xmath198 . then a simple combinatorial argument proves that the packing number @xmath189 is at least @xmath199 , which leads to @xmath200 .",
    "an sharper combinatorial reasoning in this step leads to the slightly better bound in the theorem .",
    "our candidates for a transversal of @xmath183 are all sets @xmath201 with each @xmath202 having exactly @xmath203 points ; so @xmath204 . for technical reasons",
    ", we also permit that some of the @xmath203 points in @xmath178 coincide , so @xmath201 can be a multiset .",
    "the letter @xmath201 could also abbreviate a _ trap_. the trap is set to catch all the @xmath8-intervals in  @xmath183 , but if it is not set well enough , some of the @xmath8-intervals can escape . each of them escapes through a hole in the trap , namely through a _",

    "a @xmath8-hole consists of @xmath8 holes , one in each @xmath178 .",

    "so @xmath211 is a complete @xmath8-partite @xmath8-uniform hypergraph ( we will meet such hypergraphs several times in this book ) . by saying that a @xmath209 escapes through an edge @xmath206 of @xmath211 , we mean that @xmath180 escapes through the @xmath8-hole ( uniquely ) corresponding to  @xmath206 .",

    "the weight of an edge @xmath206 is @xmath213 here @xmath214 and @xmath215 is the distance of the @xmath23th component of @xmath180 to the closest point of @xmath205 .",
    "thus , @xmath216 can be interpreted as the slimmest margin by which a @xmath8-interval @xmath180 escaping through @xmath206 avoids being trapped .",
    "if no members of @xmath183 escape through  @xmath206 , we define @xmath216 as  0 .",
    "note that this is the only case where @xmath217 ; otherwise , if anything escapes , it does so by a positive margin , since we are dealing with closed intervals .    from the edge weights ,",
    "we derive weights of vertices : the weight @xmath218 of a vertex @xmath219 is the sum of the weights of the edges of @xmath211 containing  @xmath220 . these weights ,",

    ", until all edges are exhausted .",
    "the @xmath238-weight of @xmath241 plus all the edges discarded with it is at most @xmath242 , while all edges together have weight @xmath198 .",
    "thus , the number of steps , and also the size of the matching @xmath243 , is at least @xmath244 .",

    "@xmath564 for each node ( leaf or inner ) of level @xmath303 , there are exactly @xmath565 different inputs that lead to this node .",
    "this proves the following lemma .",
    "another way to view a ( binary ) decision tree algorithm is as follows . in the beginning",
    ", we do not know anything about the set @xmath357 , so we can view the collection of possible sets as the complete boolean algebra of all @xmath568 subsets of  @xmath474 . in the first node ( at `` level  @xmath452 '' ) we ask a question of the type `` @xmath550 '' ; this induces a subdivision of the boolean algebra into two halves , depending on whether we get answer yes or no .",

    "we ask a new question , depending on the outcome of the first question .",
    "thus we _ independently _ bisect the two halves of level @xmath452 , getting four pieces of the boolean algebra , all of the same size . @xmath571",
    "this process is iterated .",
    "it stops  we do not need to ask a further question  on the parts which we create that either contain only sets that are in @xmath183 ( this yields a yes - leaf ) or that contain only sets not in @xmath183 ( corresponding to no - leaves ) .    thus the final result is a special type of partition of the boolean algebra into intervals . some of them are yes intervals , containing only sets of  @xmath183 , all the others are no - intervals , containing no sets from  @xmath183 .",
    "if the property in question is monotone , then the union of the yes intervals ( i.e. , the set system  @xmath183 ) forms an _ ideal _ in the boolean algebra , that is , a `` down - closed '' set such that with any set that it contains it must also contain all its subsets .",
    "consider one interval @xmath576 in the partition of @xmath577 that is induced by any optimal algorithm for @xmath183 . if the leaf , at level @xmath303 , corresponding to the interval is reached through a sequence of @xmath578 yes - answers and @xmath579 no - answers ( with @xmath580 )",
    ", then this means that there are sets @xmath581 with @xmath582 and @xmath583 with @xmath584 , such that @xmath585 in other words , the interval @xmath576 contains all sets that give yes - answers when asked about any of the @xmath578  elements of  @xmath586 , no - answers when asked about any of the @xmath579  elements of  @xmath587 , while the @xmath588 elements of @xmath589 may or may not be contained in  @xmath357 .",
    "thus the interval @xmath576 has size @xmath590 , and its counting polynomial is @xmath591 now the complete set system  @xmath183 is a disjoint union of the intervals  @xmath576 , and we get @xmath592 in particular , for an optimal decision tree we have @xmath593 and thus @xmath594 at every leaf of level  @xmath303 , which means that all the summands @xmath595 have a common factor of @xmath596 .",
    "we can now draw the conclusion , based only on simple counting , that most set families are evasive .",
    "this can not of course be used to settle any specific cases , but it can at least make the various evasiveness conjectures seem more plausible .",
    "let @xmath609 be any @xmath303-orbit of @xmath253 , that is , a collection of @xmath303-sets @xmath610 on which @xmath253 acts transitively .",
