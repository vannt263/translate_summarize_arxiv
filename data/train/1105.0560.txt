    "most fundamental aspects of the kondo effect are by now very well understood,@xcite with various detailed theoretical predictions having been confirmed directly by experiments on impurity systems or quantum dot devices.@xcite key insights into the underlying physics have been provided by the renormalization group ( rg ) concept , where progressive reduction of the temperature or energy scale results in rg flow between ` fixed points ' ( fps ) that can be easily identified for a given model . in particular ,",
    "the low - temperature / energy physics is governed by rg flow between two fundamental fps , with universality arising in terms of the crossover energy scale .    the anderson impurity model ( aim )",
    "captures many generic aspects of quantum impurity physics .",
    "_ three _ fps ( and hence two crossover energy scales ) arise : charge fluctuations on the impurity or quantum dot dominate at the ` free orbital ' ( fo ) fp , which describes the high - energy physics .",
    "but due to strong impurity electron correlations , a spin-@xmath3 ` local moment ' ( lm ) forms below @xmath7 ( typically a high - energy scale ) .",
    "rg flow from this lm fp to the ` strong coupling ' ( sc ) fp occurs on a much lower energy scale @xmath1 , and determines the universal low - energy behaviour .",
    "the sc fp itself describes the ground state in which the incipient moment associated with the lm fp is dynamically screened by conduction electrons , which together form a many - body ` kondo singlet ' state.@xcite    surprisingly however , the underlying physics in real - space is still somewhat controversial .",
    "various theoretical studies@xcite have examined real - space behaviour in a number of impurity models .",
    "while they do appear to have established the existence of a kondo length - scale , @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 the fermi velocity ) , the nature of the two spatial regions separated by it remains unclear .",
    "certain quantities have been studied in the universal scaling regime,@xcite but the full and exact evolution of real - space quantities  and a satisfactory unifying interpretation of the results  has not yet been provided .",
    "the prevailing view@xcite is that at low temperatures @xmath2 , a spin-@xmath3 impurity forms a singlet by binding to a surrounding ` kondo cloud ' of spatial extent @xmath4 .",
    "this has an intuitive appeal from the perspective of fermi liquid theory , where one imagines that the impurity is ` invisible ' to conduction electrons _ outside _ the screening cloud.@xcite but no clear evidence in support of the screening cloud scenario has so far emerged .",
    "very recently , refinement of scanning tunneling spectroscopy techniques reported in ref .",
    "has shown for the first time that kondo signatures in the local density of states ( ldos ) appear away from an impurity .",
    "experimental verification of the elusive kondo length - scale  and resolution of the real - space debate  may now finally be within reach .",
    "motivated in part by these developments , we consider here the wider question of how rg flow manifests in real - space .",
    "while necessarily perturbative , a simple intuitive picture is suggested by well - known scaling arguments applied directly to real - space,@xcite where notions of rg and universality again arise .",
    "one might anticipate then that this universality could show up in certain real - space quantities .",
    "indeed , some concrete evidence to support this general expectation has been provided theoretically@xcite if not experimentally .    encouraged by these results , we show in this paper that motion away from an impurity corresponds to rg flow .",
    "in fact , we demonstrate explicitly and exactly that signatures of the _ entire _ rg flow between all fps ( whether universal or non - universal ) must appear fully in real - space .",
    "just as flow between a pair of fps results in a characteristic energy scale , we show that one can similarly identify the corresponding _",
    "length_-scale , apparent in real - space as a crossover between physical behaviour typical of each fp .",
    "in particular , this implies that length - scales can be attributed both to moment formation and moment compensation .",
    "in real impurity or quantum dot systems , the moment screened by the kondo effect at low temperatures does not reside on the impurity or dot itself , but is an extended object which develops in real - space due to electron correlations .",
    "further insight is gained by considering the effect on the real - space physics of increasing temperature .",
    "rg flow is cut off at an energy scale @xmath10 ; likewise rg flow is arrested on the thermal length - scale @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , clouds associated with low - energy fps reached at larger distances ` evaporate ' successively on increasing temperature .",
    "our refined real - space kondo screening scenario is summarized schematically in fig .",
    "[ clouds ] .",
    "for simplicity and concreteness , we consider first a semi - infinite tight - binding chain , @xmath12 , with a single anderson impurity tunnel - coupled to one end : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total number operator for the impurity , and the hybridization strength is @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 the fermi level density of states and @xmath17 the half - bandwidth ) . as in previous theoretical work,@xcite",
    "we focus here on the ` excess ' charge density due to the impurity , obtained via @xmath18 with @xmath19^{-1}$ ] the fermi function and @xmath20 the difference in the site-@xmath21 green function with and without the impurity .",

    "by contrast , the behaviour of the full green function @xmath29 is deeply non - trivial due to electron correlations on the impurity which are ultimately responsible for local moment formation and thence the kondo effect .",
    "but these correlations are _ local _ , and so the subtle real - space behaviour of @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be determined from purely local impurity quantities .",

    "the spatial dependence of @xmath36 thus enters only through the power of @xmath37 , reflecting physically the fact that electrons must hop @xmath38 times to get to the impurity .",
    "@xmath39 is the usual scattering t - matrix , with @xmath40 the impurity green function . in the trivial non - interacting limit ( @xmath41 ) , the impurity merely gives rise to potential scattering , and",

    "far from the impurity , eqs .  [ dens ] and [ eom ] reduce to @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the fourier transform of the fermi function , and where @xmath45 depends purely on the fermi liquid phase shift @xmath46 . at low - temperatures @xmath47 ,",
    "one obtains asymptotically @xmath48 , while at higher temperatures , density oscillations are exponentially suppressed via @xmath49 , with the thermal length - scale @xmath50 so defined , and appearing naturally .",
    "the situation of interest is of course the @xmath51 _ interacting _ aim , where @xmath30 and hence @xmath52 now contain information about the kondo effect . in this work",
    "we employ the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) to obtain accurately @xmath52.@xcite provided @xmath2 , signatures of kondo physics and rg flow are naturally expected in the green function or ldos for any site in real - space ( see eq .  [ eom ] ) , and this has been recently confirmed experimentally.@xcite but the factorized form of eq .",
    "[ eom ] implies that such measurements can not reveal a kondo _ length_-scale , @xmath4 ( there can be no universality in terms of @xmath53 ) .",
    "the key point is that the real - space charge densities are obtained from a simple integral transformation of the frequency - resolved t - matrix by eqs .",
    "[ dens ] and [ eom ] . indeed , far from the impurity this transformation reduces to a fourier transformation , whose well - defined inverse guarantees the complete conservation of information for the process @xmath54 . in consequence , the full rg structure of the underlying quantum impurity problem ( as manifest in the t - matrix or ldos ) is _ wholly reproduced _ in the spatial variation of @xmath55 .",

    "[ rgflow ] , where the energy - dependence of the spectrum @xmath56 is compared with the space - dependence of the densities @xmath57 , normalized by the pure potential scattering contribution at long distances ( with @xmath58 and @xmath46 now the phase shift of the interacting problem ) .",
    "the representative systems plotted in fig .  [ rgflow ] have similar energy scales @xmath59 , but widely differing kondo scales @xmath1 .",
    "the densities shown in the lower panel exhibit clearly rg flow between fps , now as a function of distance : a non - universal crossover length - scale @xmath5 characterizes moment formation on flowing from fo to lm fps , while @xmath4 sets the universal length - scale for kondo screening of this moment on flowing to the sc  fp .    since the sc fp can be thought of as a free conduction band with one site removed , a @xmath60 phase shift results.@xcite as shown in ref .",
    "for the kondo model , this is responsible for a sign - change in the friedel oscillations .",
    "indeed , this provides a natural explanation of the limiting universal values @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 ; and the resulting minimum in @xmath66 allows direct identification of the kondo length - scale .",
    "however , we point out that the fo fp can similarly be thought of as a free conduction band with an additional potential scatterer .",
    "the resulting phase shift @xmath46 also results in a minimum of @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "both length - scales of the anderson model can be simply identified in this way , and we find @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; consistent with expectations based on simple scaling grounds .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 grows as the impurity - host coupling decreases.@xcite indeed , kondo screening is totally absent in the limit of an uncoupled impurity @xmath70 . here",
    "local moment physics persists and @xmath4 diverges .",
    "this implies directly that the spatial region @xmath63 ( @xmath71 ) is described by the lm fp , and can not be as such a ` screening cloud ' .",
    "one naturally expects the rg structure of the problem to be manifest also in the temperature - dependence of physical quantities .",
    "this is strikingly apparent in thermodynamics such as the entropy,@xcite whose impurity contribution flows from @xmath72 at the fo fp to @xmath73 at the lm fp , and finally @xmath74 at the sc fp , symptomatic of complete kondo screening ; and as shown in fig .",

    "as the temperature is increased through @xmath1 , we find that @xmath77 moves out to _ larger _ distances ( while @xmath76 remains unaffected ) .",
    "on destroying the kondo effect by increasing temperature , one would expect a ` screening cloud ' per se to collapse ; but understanding @xmath4 instead as the length - scale for rg flow from lm to sc fps , the divergence of @xmath77 indicates simply the spatial persistence of local moment physics .",
    "temperature cuts off rg flow to the sc fp , and so there can be no crossover kondo length - scale to an sc region of space for @xmath78 .",
