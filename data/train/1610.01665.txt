    "according to the currently most favored cosmological model , the @xmath0cdm model ( @xmath0 denotes the cosmological constant , cdm stands for cold dark matter ) , our observable universe is geometrically flat and  normal \" , i.e. baryonic , matter is only responsible for about 4 - 5@xmath2 of its content .",
    "most of the universe is composed of two exotic  fluids \" : dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) .",
    "neither of these exotic components can be observed directly so far , but there are arguments that support their existence .",
    "dm explains galaxy rotation curves and plays a crucial role in cosmic structure formation .",
    "de is seen as an effective fluid with negative pressure , possibly associated with the quantum vacuum .",
    "this  fluid \" is able to account for the accelerated expansion of the scale factor of the robertson - walker metric of the standard model . even being a model with observational success ,",
    "the @xmath0cdm model leaves open the physical nature of these dark components .",
    "moreover , there are a number of tensions which still await clarification ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is therefore ongoing interest in discussing and probing alternative approaches which differ in one or more aspects from the @xmath0cdm dynamics .",
    "one line of research does no longer regard dm and de to be independent components with separate energy - momentum conservation but investigates the consequences of a more complex structure of the dark sector , modeled by an interaction between its principal constituents .",
    "admitting the possibility of a non - gravitational coupling between dm and de is , of course , the more general case which gives rise to a richer cosmological dynamics . in particular , this generalization implies the existence of de perturbations , even for cases of an equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter @xmath3 , sometimes called decaying vacuum models @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that ignoring de perturbations may result in unreliable conclusions concerning the interpretation of observational data @xcite . for further studies about clustering de see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite . ignoring a potential interaction between both dark components altogether , may result in an incorrect interpretation of cosmological data @xcite .",
    "many models have been established by now which consider different types of interactions @xcite .",
    "some more recent studies include @xcite .",
    "all of them are phenomenological since the physical nature of the dark sector largely remains a matter of speculation . in most cases interactions",
    "are assumed to be linear in the sense that the coupling terms in the energy - momentum balances of the components are proportional either to the dm density or to the de density or to a linear combination of both densities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there exists a large body of literature which studies such models , usually resulting in limits on the type or the strength of the interaction .",
    "now , from a physical point of view it seems more natural to prefer an interaction that depends on the product of the abundances of the individual components , as , e.g. , in chemical reactions .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a coupling proportional to the product of the densities of dm and de is also observationally favored over linear models .",
    "further recent studies of non - linearly interacting de models are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "systems with non - linear interactions do not allow , in most cases , an analytic treatment , not even for the homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "here we consider the special case of a non - linear interaction for which there exists an analytic background solution .",
    "while the existence of such analytic solution is important in itself , we emphasize its usefulness in setting up the system of equations for the perturbation dynamics about this background .",
    "this solution will be characterized by a single additional parameter the value of which serves to quantify and to restrict potential differences from the @xmath0cdm model in a simple and transparent way . using a suitable modification of the camb code @xcite we focus on the implications of the coupling on the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and on the ( total ) matter power spectrum .",
    "this complements and extends previous work on the status of the non - linear model using large - scale - structure data @xcite . in this context",
    "we also point out that the simple use of the position of the first acoustic peak in the cmb anisotropy spectrum , something which was occasionally done in the literature , is not a reliable criterion in assessing competing cosmological models .",
