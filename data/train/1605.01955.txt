    "hot exoplanets , i.e. , exoplanets with orbital periods of approximately a few days , are unique laboratories for the study of star - planet interactions ( hereafter spis ) .",
    "the large amounts of stellar uv and euv radiation that these planets receive heats the planetary atmosphere and can result in significant photoevaporative mass loss across a broad range of planetary masses ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the mass loss is significant and the planet overflows its roche lobe , the outflowing planetary material can accrete onto the star @xcite .",
    "the short orbital distances of these planets can also result in large tidal interactions , generating enhanced activity levels on the star that are directly related to the orbital phase of the planet @xcite .",
    "direct magnetic interactions via reconnection events or magnetic torques are also possible and can affect the orbital and spin evolution of the planet and star @xcite . understanding these interactions is important in order to move towards a full characterization of exoplanets and a complete knowledge of their evolution under extreme conditions .",
    "two particularly interesting classes of spis are the direct interaction of escaping planetary material ( i.e. , the planetary wind ) and the stellar wind and the interaction of the planet s magnetosphere with the stellar wind .",
    "both scenarios are capable of producing bow shocks at the interaction region which results in a significant density enhancement of the shocked material @xcite . for parameters relevant to most hot planet systems ,",
    "the interaction region in both cases occurs ahead of the planet in its orbit .",
    "observationally this can produce a pre - transit signature ( for transiting or very nearly transiting planets ) if the material ahead of the planet is sufficiently opaque to produce measurable absorption @xcite . in the case of a bow shock mediated by the planet s magnetosphere",
    ", it is possible to estimate the strength of the field given some assumptions about the stellar wind @xcite . while estimates of this sort are rough , this method of measuring exoplanet magnetic fields may be worth pursuing considering the challenges of directly detecting emission from electrons in the planetary magnetosphere and the current lack of such confirmed detections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a third scenario capable of producing pre - transit absorption is the loss of planetary material that then accretes onto the central star .",
    "accretion streams or time - variable blobs are predicted from some simulations of hot planet mass loss @xcite and have been suggested as the cause of observed uv flares for hd 189733 b @xcite .",
    "accretion streams or blobs can be viewed in transmission if the optical depth is sufficiently high in the transition of interest .",
    "besides material transiting ahead of the planet , changes in the stellar activity level can be also produce observable changes in the pre - transit transmission spectrum : if spectra from a period of low activity are compared to spectra from a period of higher activity , the relative difference can produce features similar to what is seen in tranmission spectrum absorption lines .",
    "hd 189733 is an active early k - star @xcite and , especially for the balmer line analysis presented here , contributions from the stellar chromosphere may be non - negligible .",
    "these contributions need to be taken into account when interpreting transmission spectra of lines produced in stellar active regions .",
    "evidence for pre - transit material has now been observed in a handful of hot planet systems , namely wasp-12 b @xcite , hd 189733 b @xcite , and gj 436 b @xcite ( see section 1 of * ? ? ? * for a brief overview ) .",
    "most recently , @xcite reported a large pre - transit absorption signature , as well as enhanced in - transit absorption , in lyman-@xmath0 around the hot neptune gj 436 b. they model the early ingress as an extended cloud of hydrogen which has escaped from the planet .",
    "the escaping material is subject to radiation pressure from the star , which in the case of gj 436 is too weak to overcome the stellar gravity and instead acts as a radiative braking agent on the gas @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite do not include the interaction of the planetary wind with the stellar wind . in (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) we describe a pre - transit absorption measurement in the balmer lines for the hot jupiter hd 189733 b @xcite .",
    "we showed that the absorption strength and time series evolution of the absorption is consistent with the geometry of a thin bow shock at @xmath113 @xmath2 ahead of the planet .",
    "there are difficulties , however , in maintaining a population of hot neutral hydrogen at large distances from the planet ( huang & christie , private communication ) .",
    "furthermore , it is unlikely that the densities produced by a compressed stellar wind at typical hot jupiter orbital distances are high enough in most atomic species to generate the necessary opacity , although escaping planetary material trapped in the magnetosphere may be sufficient @xcite .",
    "regardless of their precise interpretation , it appears that pre - transit absorption signals should be fairly common for hot planets .",
    "however , detections of these phenomena seem to be limited to specific atomic transitions ; they have not yet been detected using near - uv broadband methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) nor , to the best of our knowledge , optical photometry .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic observations are expensive and are limited to the brightest transiting targets . as a result ,",
    "the detection and characterization of these signals , including their variability , will require a significant observational investment .",
    "in this paper we present followup observations to the 2013 transit of hd 189733 b presented in .",
    "our observations of the 2013 transit missed a large portion of the pre - transit phase due to an observing strategy that was not designed to monitor pre - transit signals .",
    "the 2015 transit observations provide complete coverage of the @xmath14 hours of visible pre - transit phase .",
    "the instrumental setup and experimental design are almost identical to the 2013 transit , facilitating a direct comparison between the two measurement sets . in we briefly describe the transit observations and data reduction .",
    "details the construction of the balmer line , d lines , and 5184   transmission spectra and the line absorption time series for each line .",
    "we present an analysis of the h and k lines , which serve as a proxy of the stellar activity level , in . the residual core flux analysis in differs from the mt .",
    "wilson @xmath3 analysis presented in and provides a more precise estimate of the relative stellar activity level .",
    "contrary to the @xmath3 index analysis presented in , the core flux analysis shows that there is some relationship between the stellar activity level and the measured absorption .",
    "we present possible model scenarios to describe the new pre - transit absorption in .",
    "we will present a detailed analysis of the in - transit absorption in a forthcoming paper . in we give a general summary of the results and comment on future work that is required to clarify the nature of the pre - transit signature .",
    "a single transit epoch of hd 189733 b was obtained on the night of august , 4 2015 using hires on keck i @xcite .",
    "the instrument setup and experimental design were identical to the 2013 transit observations described in .",
    "we briefly review them here .",
    "the b2 decker was used and the resolving power of the observations is @xmath4@xmath168,000 at h@xmath0 .",
    "exposure times were 5 minutes for all observations resulting in an average signal - to - noise of 450 for the extracted spectra at h@xmath0 , 200 at h@xmath5 , and 150 at h@xmath6 .",
    "the data were reduced using the hires redux package written by jason x. prochaskaxavier / hiredux/ ] .",
    "all standard reduction steps were taken and the barycentric velocity of the observatory is removed , along with the radial velocity of the hd 189733 system which we take to be @xmath7 km s@xmath8 @xcite , leaving the spectra in the rest frame of the star .",
    "wavelength solutions are performed on th - ar exposures taken at the beginning and end of the night .",
    "telluric absorption is removed from the h@xmath0 and spectra using the telluric fitting program molecfit @xcite .",
    "a telluric standard was observed at the beginning of the night .",
    "the telluric model is first applied to the standard and then scaled and shifted to fit each individual observation using a least - squares minimization routine .",
    "the transmission spectrum is defined here as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a single observation and @xmath11 is the master comparison spectrum .",
    "the master comparison spectrum is a weighted average of a set of spectra that are , ideally , free of any absorption contamination , i.e. , they represent the pure stellar spectrum . in order for each @xmath10 to be compared to @xmath11 ,",
    "the spectra need to be normalized and aligned in wavelength space .",
    "the required constant wavelength shifts from one observation to the next , which are calculated by cross - correlating a large number of metal lines in the order of interest , are of the order 0.01 - 0.02   or 0.5 - 1.0 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the corrections applied to the h@xmath0 order , relative to the first observed spectrum , are shown in .",
    "higher order functions , e.g. , linear or spline fits , are not necessary to align the spectra . after the spectra",
    "are aligned and divided by @xmath11 they are renormalized to remove any residual slope in the continuum .",
    "we note that hires is a very stable spectrograph and does not produce large instrumental effects on the observed spectrum .",
    "this is important for having confidence in the transmission spectrum signal as being due to real changes in the star - planet system and not from instrument and telescope systematics .",
    "furthermore , any systematic shifting of the spectrum on the detector or changes in resolution would uniformly affect all stellar lines in a single order .",
    "this is never observed : all of the transmission line profiles reported here occur only in the cores of the stellar lines of interest and not in the plethora of other stellar lines present in every order .",
    "thus we are confident all of the reported transmission signals are intrinsic to the star - planet system .    in order to create the transmission spectrum ,",
    "the comparison spectra used to generate the master comparison spectrum must be selected . since all of the absorption is measured relative to the master comparison spectrum , choosing different spectra will increase or decrease the measured absorption values .",
    "thus the true zero - point is difficult to determine for the small window of time that a single night of observing provides .",
    "we have chosen to use the eight spectra from @xmath12 minutes to @xmath13 as the comparison spectra for the analysis presented below in the rest of .",
    "these spectra are chosen since they are the earliest spectra obtained during the night and are farthest from the planet transit in time .",
    "if pre - transit absorption is due to extended structures around the planet , the farther the observations occur from the planet transit the less likely those observations are to contain a signal from optically thick circumplanetary material .",
    "of course , this does not guarantee that the spectra are uncontaminated by such material .",
    "our choice of comparison spectra and the consequences for interpreting the absorption measurements will be discussed in .",
    "the average transmission spectra are shown in for h@xmath0 6562.79   ( first row ) , h@xmath5 4861.35   ( second row ) , and h@xmath6 4340.47   ( third row ) for the pre - transit ( first column ) , in - transit ( second column ) , and out - of - transit comparison observations ( third column ) .",
    "the number of spectra used to compute the average spectrum is shown in the bottom right corner of each panel in the first row .",
    "the fourth column shows the empirical monte carlo ( emc ) distributions , which highlight the influence of systematic effects on the absorption measurements , of the absorption for each line .",
    "the fifth column shows the emc for the pre - transit signal .",
    "shows the same thing for the 5895.92   and 5183.60   lines . due to its location at the very edge of the order",
    ", we do not extract and analyze the 5889   line .",
    "we perform two different emc procedures : an in - in and in - out procedure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for similar applications ) .",
    "the pre - pre and pre - out procedures are identical but for the pre - transit spectra .",
    "the in - out emc compares randomly selected subsets of the in - transit spectra to the master comparison spectrum .",
    "the number of random spectra varies from @xmath14=5 to @xmath14=18 and the process is repeated for @xmath14=5000 iterations .",
    "the in - in procedure compares a random subset of in - transit spectra with another random subset of in - transit spectra .",
    "the random subsets are chosen without replacement so that spectra are never compared to themselves and the number of random spectra varies from @xmath14=2 to @xmath14=16 .",
    "the in - in distributions should be centered at zero absorption and should be broader than the in - out distributions due to the effect of comparing two different random subsets instead of one random subset with a fixed comparison spectrum .",
    "we choose the standard deviation of the in - out distribution as the 1@xmath15 uncertainty associated with the emc procedure since this is directly related to the variation in the absorption measurement .",
    "as expected , the in - in distributions ( green ) are centered near zero absorption .",
    "the 1@xmath15 values from the in - out emc procedure are shown in black .",
    "we also calculate the propagated flux uncertainty associated with the master absorption measurement ( vertical red dashed line ) .",
    "the flux uncertainty is the standard deviation of two 50 km s@xmath8 wide portions of the transmission spectrum from @xmath16-@xmath17 km s@xmath8 and @xmath18-@xmath19 km s@xmath8 weighted by the square root of the normalized observed spectrum in order to account for the larger uncertainties in the line cores .",
    "this value is shown in orange .",
    "the larger of the emc and flux uncertainty measurements is used for determining the significance of the absorption . the significance level @xmath20",
    "is shown in red next to the master absorption measurement .",

    "the master absorption detections are presented in .",

    "the level of in - transit h@xmath0 absorption is almost identical to that from @xcite ( @xmath28=13.7@xmath2910@xmath30  ) and 2.3@xmath29 the value measured in ( @xmath28=5.9@xmath2910@xmath30  ) .",
    "the in - transit h@xmath6 absorption is detected at 4.0@xmath15 ; the measurement is marginal ( 2.2@xmath15 ) for the pre - transit absorption .",
    "the in - transit absorption is detected at 4.4@xmath15 while the absorption is marginal at 2.4@xmath15 .",
    "there is little evidence for pre - transit absorption in either line . in order to compare our 5896   in - transit absorption value to previously reported high resolution absorption ,",
    "we have applied to the 5896   transmission spectra presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in the case of @xcite , we have used their reported gaussian fit parameters for the 5896   line in order to approximate the absorption . for @xcite we find @xmath31=2.85@xmath320.85@xmath33  ; for @xcite , @xmath31=3.59@xmath321.61@xmath2910@xmath30  ; for @xcite , @xmath31=2.22@xmath2910@xmath30  . our reported value of @xmath341.50@xmath320.34@xmath2910@xmath30   is consistently lower than the previous measurements .",

    "although the 5184   line arises from an excited state and thus the line strength is not favorable compared to the uv resonance line , future investigations should consider examining the 5184   line due to its ease of observability compared to the uv lines ( see * ? ? ? * ) and to confirm or reject the measurement presented here .",

    "individual @xmath37 uncertainties are shown for and in and .    the pre - transit balmer line signature in begins abruptly at @xmath38 minutes , which corresponds to a linear distance of @xmath117 r@xmath39 to the stellar limb , and lasts for @xmath170 minutes until it abruptly disappears .",
    "it then returns to a similar level after @xmath140 minutes and remains relatively constant until immediately before first contact .",

    "the abrupt changes in the level of in - transit absorption , e.g. , at @xmath40 , 5 , and 40 minutes , may be due to the planet transiting the inhomogeneous stellar surface . the effect of active regions and changes in the stellar activity level on the line absorption will be discussed more fully in .",
    "an interesting feature of the 2015 transit is that the absorption appears to persist immediately post - transit for @xmath130 minutes .",
    "the subsequent decrease in absorption at @xmath190 minutes , and appearance of emission in the line cores of h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 , may be due to a change in the stellar activity level , e.g. , a mild flaring event .",

    "the structure of the in - transit absorption shows a similar shape to the center - to - limb variations ( clvs ) described by @xcite .",
    "clvs may be important in determining the precise level of atmospheric absorption and should be taken into account for a detailed analysis of the in - transit absorption .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the consistently high post - transit values of @xmath31 in appear to be due to the large core residuals and not to any real emission features .",
    "the signal - to - noise in the individual h@xmath0 transmission spectra is high enough to consider the overall velocity shift of the absorption .",
    "measurements of the line velocity can be useful in understanding the mass motions of the absorbing material .",
    "in particular , measurements of in - transit line velocities can provide information about the planetary rotation and atmospheric dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "here we will focus on the pre - transit line velocities and a detailed analysis of the in - transit velocities will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the velocity is measured for each h@xmath0 transmission spectrum which has a w@xmath36 value significant at the 2@xmath15 level .",
    "we use a flux - weighted average from @xmath46 to @xmath47 km s@xmath8 to measure the velocity of the absorption :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the square of the transmission spectrum flux at velocity @xmath23 .",
    "this ensures that deeper portions of the line are heavily weighted .",
    "we also add back in the velocity corrections from .",
    "we note that these corrections are small ( @xmath1 - 1.0 to 1.0 km s@xmath8 ) and do not significantly affect any of the conclusions based on the line velocities discussed here .",
    "the uncertainty in each velocity is the standard deviation of the distribution derived from calculating the line velocity for each of the @xmath50 combinations ( @xmath51 for the 2013 data set ) used to produce the individual spectra in .",
    "this is essentially the emc process introduced in .",
    "we add an extra 1.0 km s@xmath8 to each uncertainty to approximate the error in the original velocity correction .",
    "the h@xmath0 velocities for both the 2013 and 2015 data sets are shown in .",
    "most of the 2015 pre - transit velocities are red - shifted , indicating material moving away from the observer .",
    "however , immediately before the transit the velocities are grouped relatively close to zero with a sharp transition down from @xmath524 km s@xmath8 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 minutes .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for this abrupt change in the line velocity .",
    "also note the consistent blue - shift of the 2013 in - transit points compared to the symmetric in - transit velocities of the 2015 data .",
    "we will revisit the pre - transit velocities during in the context of the clumpy accretion stream model .",
    "the h and k lines are frequently used as stellar activity indicators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are standard diagnostics of solar flare energetics and dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "h@xmath0 , which is in emission in stellar active regions , is also used as an activity measure @xcite and correlates directly with h and k across solar cycles @xcite .",
    "much variation exists , however , in the h@xmath0- h and k correlation for other stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "surface h@xmath0 activity can therefore mimic an absorption signature : if the comparison spectra capture the star in a more active state compared to the spectra of interest ( e.g. , the pre- or in - transit spectra ) , the filling in of the line cores in the active spectra will result in `` absorption '' in the transmission spectrum of a non - active spectrum .",
    "thus it is critical to understand the stellar activity level as a function of time in order to attempt to separate any activity contribution to the absorption signature .    while measurements of and h@xmath0 core flux have been used to study the long term ( days to years ) influence of hot planets on their host stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there has been little effort to characterize the very short term variations ( minutes to hours ) in the line cores of stars other than the sun .",
    "ideally , short - cadence observations of the star would be carried out at multiple phases of a single planetary orbit in order to establish a baseline of the short - term stellar activity level and characterize typical changes in the line core flux .",
    "this baseline could be used to separate the purely stellar component from any variations caused by circumstellar material during the phase of interest .",
    "h@xmath0 and h and k emission is spatially coincident in active regions on the sun ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the two line fluxes do not necessarily correlate across the entire solar disk .",
    "filaments , which are cooler than plages and can absorb active region h@xmath0 emission , can affect the level of observed h@xmath0 flux and weaken the correlation between h@xmath0 and h and k @xcite .",
    "short cadence observations of flaring regions on the sun show a direct correlation between and h@xmath0 excess emission equivalent widths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a similar correspondence is seen in dme flares . in the case of dme objects ,",
    "the peak k flux occurs @xmath130 minutes after the peak in the balmer line fluxes and variations of @xmath15% are common on 10-minute timescales @xcite .",
    "although hd 189733 is not as active as a typical dme star , it is an active k - dwarf and so it is likely that it would exhibit low - level chromospheric variability on short timescales . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no continuous short - cadence observations of hd 189733 s h@xmath0 and the h and k lines , similar to the observations presented here and in , have been published .",
    "thus it is difficult , outside of the transits presented in this work , to quantify the stellar contribution to variations in the line fluxes on short timescales .        in",
    "we used the time series structure of the mt .",
    "wilson s@xmath55 index to argue that the pre - transit signal was not caused by varying stellar activity and was instead due to material occulting the star .",
    "this argument was based on the lack of correlation between the s@xmath55 index and w@xmath56 . furthermore , the mean s@xmath55 value of the comparison spectra was almost identical to that of the pre - transit spectra , suggesting a similar activity level pre- and post - transit . however , the s@xmath55 index compares the core flux with a wide continuum window and , as a result , is subject to variations in the continuum flux .",
    "small variations in the continuum window flux , which are not necessarily related to the same physical processes causing flux changes in the line cores , can thus mimic changes in the stellar activity level .    in order to mitigate any contribution to the activity index by the continuum windows",
    ", we have reanalyzed the 2013 lines using the residual core flux method of @xcite .",
    "we have also applied this analysis to the 2015 lines . to be clear , the s@xmath55 index is well suited for measuring average activity levels across different epochs and , indeed ,",
    "we present the average s@xmath55 values for each night in . however , a more precise measurement of variations in the stellar activity level , is better achieved by measuring only the core flux .",
    "the residual profiles are constructed by normalizing the line core to 0.1   wide spectral regions centered at 3967.05   and 3969.95   and subtracting the mean profile of the same comparison spectra used to generate the average balmer line transmission spectra .",

    "this would weaken any interpretation of the @xmath61-@xmath28 correlation as testing the relationship between stellar activity in the two lines .",
    "on the other hand , any absorption by pre - transit material in one line but not the other has a similar effect .",

    "thus we can assume with some confidence that the maximum active region coverage fraction of hd 189733 b is less than 15% .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that brightness changes in more active stars are dominated by spots rather than faculae ( i.e. , bright active regions ) , although this does not rule out active region variability as the cause of small changes in spectral line flux .",

    "this results in many different combinations of @xmath62 and @xmath66 being able to reproduce the observed changes in w@xmath56 .",
    "regardless of the specific values of @xmath62 and @xmath66 , the measured levels of pre- and in - transit absorption in both the 2013 and 2015 data can be approximated by relatively small changes in the stellar activity level between the comparison spectra and the spectrum of interest .",
    "the smaller pre - transit values for the 2015 transit can be reproduced by almost any combination of @xmath66 and @xmath62 .",
    "the large values from the 2013 transit can be reproduced by most of the parameter combinations but weak line strengths require large surface coverage fractions .",
    "although hd 189733 is an active star , it is unclear whether 8 - 10% of the visible hemisphere can be covered in bright active regions .",
    "high - cadence monitoring of hd 189733 while hd 189733 b is not transiting will provide a better statistical understanding of activity variations on @xmath15 minutes timescales and help determine the true nature of the pre - transit signal .",
    "for in - transit measurements , contrast between the comparison spectra , which are integrated across the entire stellar disk , and the in - transit spectrum of interest , which is integrated across the stellar disk not covered by the opaque planet , can result in line strength differences as the spectrum is weighted towards active or spotted regions of the star @xcite .",
    "the contrast effect can be demonstrated by a planet with no atmosphere transiting a chord that is free of spots or active - regions . in this case , the in - transit spectrum will be weighted towards the spotted or active stellar surface by the ratio ( @xmath2/@xmath69)@xmath70 . for the hd 189733 system , ( @xmath2/@xmath69)@xmath70=0.024 . if the out - of - transit spectrum is composed of 1.00% spotted / active region spectrum , the weighting of the in - transit spectrum , ignoring limb darkening , will change to 1.02% spotted / active and 98.98% quiescent . thus any difference between the spotted / active region spectrum and the quiescent stellar spectrum will affect the transmission spectrum at the level of 0.02% .",
    "this is much smaller than the observed in - transit line depth .",
    "we note that this effect changes weakly with increased spot / active region coverage and is @xmath711% even for coverage fractions of 30% .",
    "in addition , the in - transit signal begins before the optical transit and continues after the opaque planetary disk leaves the stellar disk .",
    "this is further evidence that the absorption is caused by gas in the planet s atmosphere and not the contrast effect since the contrast effect requires some of the stellar surface to be blocked by the planet .",
    "the analysis in shows that differing levels of stellar activity at different times during the period of observation can affect the relative level of measured absorption in the line core .",
    "this is directly related to the choice of comparison spectra . if instead of choosing spectra numbers 2 - 9 for the 2015 transit we select the observations between @xmath72 and @xmath73 minutes as the comparison spectra , all of the measured w@xmath36 ( ) values would shift up by the relative average difference between the points in those time ranges .",
    "thus instead of pre - transit _ absorption _ we would observe an initial period of enhanced stellar activity , followed by a relative period of quiescence , then another brief activity increase between @xmath74 and @xmath75 minutes , and finally relative quiescence immediately before the transit .",
    "if instead we chose the post - transit spectra , as we chose to do in , the in - transit absorption would be very weak and all of the pre - transit w@xmath36 measurements would be positive , suggesting sustained levels of higher stellar activity compared to in- and post - transit times .",
    "thus clearly the choice of comparison spectra can influence the interpretation of the w@xmath36 values .",
    "our main justification for choosing the earliest observations in the 2015 data as the comparison spectra is that they are located furthest from the transit and thus have a lower likelihood of being contaminated by high - density pre - transit material capable of producing an absorption signature .",
    "it would not be unreasonable , however , to select a different set of pre - transit spectra .",
    "we believe the low post - transit w@xmath36 values , and their significant variability , rule these spectra out as good out - of - transit baseline values .",
    "the up - and - down nature of the 2015 pre - transit w@xmath36 values do not offer much evidence for or against absorbing material versus changes in the stellar activity level as the cause of the signal .",
    "however , if the large pre - transit variations of @xmath10.005 - 0.007   at @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 minutes were caused by changes in the stellar activity level , this would indicate such variations are common and we might expect to see similar changes on similar timescales during and after the transit . this is not the case : most of the in - transit variations are of smaller magnitude ( @xmath10.003 - 0.005  ) and shorter timescales , which may be due to transits of active regions . furthermore",
    ", the duration of the dip in w@xmath56 starting at @xmath79 minutes is @xmath180 minutes which is very close to the transit duration of a  narrow \" feature",
    ". it would be surprising if the star s activity level happened to abruptly change on similar timescales as the transit duration .    finally ,",
    "although the individual @xmath80 values are marginal , if the pre - transit spectra between @xmath76 and @xmath77 minutes or between @xmath78 and @xmath81 minutes are chosen as the comparison spectra , the in - transit h@xmath5 absorption becomes much weaker or disappears entirely .",
    "our results demonstrate the need for a longer baseline of short cadence observations in order to establish the true out - of - transit stellar activity baseline .",
    "in we modeled the pre - transit absorption as arising in a thin bow shock orbiting @xmath113 @xmath2 ahead of the planet . while this simple geometric model was able to account for the absorption time series and the strength of the measured absorption , the favored model parameters resulted in two relatively unlikely conclusions : 1 . a low stellar wind speed of @xmath140 km s@xmath8 at the planet s orbital radius ; 2 .",

    "than that estimated by @xcite for hd 189733 b based on magnetic field strength scaling relations for brown dwarfs and giant planets .",
    "while field strengths of this magnitude are estimated for more massive planets , it is difficult to produce such a strong field for a jupiter - mass object @xcite .",
    "the absorption time series shown in does not match the specific prediction of the bow shock model from .",
    "furthermore , we were unsuccessful at finding a suitable bow shock model to describe the 2015 time series .",
    "as demonstrated in , the magnitude of the pre - transit absorption can be influenced by low level variations in the stellar activity level .",
    "if the observed signal is assumed to be solely associated with the planet , it is possible to explain the absorption as arising in transiting circumplanetary material .",
    "this motivated us to search for a geometry that is capable of reproducing the absorption .",

    "a brief summary of the in - transit model , also shown over - plotted in , is given here .",
    "we model the 2015 in - transit absorption as arising in an extended uniform density atmosphere .",
    "the choice of uniform density is motivated by the results of @xcite who find that the density of the dominant @xmath105=2 state ( the 2s state ) remains fairly constant over almost three orders of magnitude in pressure ( 10@xmath106 - 10@xmath107 bar ) .",
    "this can be understood as the result of outwardly increasing temperatures offsetting the decreasing neutral hydrogen abundance .",
    "we assign a temperature to the base of the atmosphere and this sets the scale height , @xmath108 .",
    "the 3d density grid is filled with material out to 10@xmath108 and the column density is calculated for each atmospheric point that occults the star . we find a good approximation of the average in - transit balmer line profile shape and absorption values with a density @xmath109 g cm@xmath30 and @xmath111 k , which translates to a scale height of @xmath112=0.028 @xmath2 .      when finding a model that roughly describes the pre - transit signal , we need to consider the strength and shape of the @xmath26 time series , the ratios of the balmer line @xmath26 values , and the shape of the observed line profiles .",
    "while these constraints taken together significantly narrow the available parameter space , degeneracies exist between the model parameters .",

    "this extended cloud of material is suggestive of a partially filled roche lobe .          while the accretion clump model can reproduce the observed absorption levels , and in addition to the parameter degeneracies discussed above , there are serious limitations to this interpretation",

    "this is the result of the large angle ( 60@xmath84 ) that the clump trajectory makes with the planet s orbit .",
    "this angle would need to be @xmath15 - 10@xmath84 in order to produce red - shifted velocities of 5 - 10 km s@xmath8 .",
    "a possible resolution to this problem is if the trajectory of the accreting material is altered by interactions with the stellar wind ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "it is also not clear if simple hydrodynamic roche - lobe overflow , as we ve assumed here , is directly applicable in the hot jupiter regime , especially when the confining effect of the planet s magnetosphere is taken into account @xcite .",
    "thus a more realistic treatment of the mass loss could allow the trajectory of the clumps to be less steep .    finally , there is currently little theoretical evidence to support the existence of large @xmath126 neutral hydrogen populations at such short distances from the star . during transit ,",
    "the clumps are within @xmath15 - 6 @xmath69 of the star , about 30 - 40% closer than the planet s orbit , and receive a factor of @xmath12@xmath29 more stellar radiation . again , the clump trajectory could be less extreme through interactions with the stellar wind .",

    "transmission spectra for the individual comparison spectra are constructed by comparing the exposure of interest to a master comparison spectrum that includes all of the other comparison spectra besides the spectrum of interest .",
    "this weighted average is performed to prevent individual comparison spectra from having a large influence on the individual transmission spectra .",
    "overall , the individual spectra are well defined for h@xmath0 and for the strong h@xmath5 absorption .",
    "the individual h@xmath6 spectra , however , are very noisy and the absorption is not obvious except for the times @xmath12754 , @xmath43 , and @xmath128 minutes .",
    "we note that the telescope experienced minor guiding errors at @xmath1@xmath129 minutes ( see ) . on the blue chip , where h@xmath6 is located ,",
    "the orders are closely spaced and any significant deviation of the stellar profile can result in small amounts of order overlap . for these exposures ,",
    "the stellar profile in the spatial direction on the blue ccd is 10 - 15% wider than it is for the other exposures , over which it is constant to within @xmath11 - 2% .",
    "we believe this is what accounts for the sawtooth pattern seen in the the h@xmath6 spectra from @xmath130180 minutes to @xmath131 minutes .",
    "thus the absorption values calculated from these spectra are highly suspect .",
    "the individual line profile morphologies are visible in a few of the pre - transit and in - transit spectra in",
    ". however , large residuals in the line core obscure the true shape of the line in most cases . the absorption , if present ,",
    "is too weak to be seen in all but a few of the profiles in .",

    "<S> a very weak correlation is found between the h core flux and the balmer line absorption in the 2015 transit , hinting at a smaller contribution from stellar activity compared to the 2013 transit . </S>",

    "<S> if the pre - transit signature is attributed to circumplanetary material , its evolution in time can be described by accretion clumps spiraling towards the star , although this interpretation has serious limitations . </S>",
