    "we measured @xmath0 gluon propagator of @xmath5 on lattice @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 on @xmath8 , @xmath10@xcite . shown in fig.[gl243248 ] is the gluon dressing function @xmath11 which is defined by the gluon propagator @xmath12 through d_(q ) = ( _ -q_q_q^2)d_a(q^2 ) as @xmath13 . here , we adopted the @xmath14 type definition of gauge field @xmath15 . although the size of the sample is not large , the data scale with each other and consistent with the result of@xcite .",
    "the fitted line is obtained from the model based on the principle of minimal sensitivity(pms)@xcite .",
    "the pms allows one to obtain a solution that bridges infrared region and ultraviolet region , but its uniqueness is not guaranteed and in the infrared region , there is discrepancy from other scheme that satisfies the commensurate scale relation@xcite .",
    "we leave the continuation to the infrared region to the future study and fix the parameter @xmath16 by the solution at the factorization scale@xcite i.e. @xmath17 and call it the @xmath18 scheme .    [ gl243248 ]    the ghost propagator is defined as the fourier transform of an expectation value of the inverse faddeev - popov operator @xmath19 @xmath20)^{-1}| \\lambda^b y\\rangle \\rangle\\ ] ] the lattice data scales and the pms in @xmath18 scheme fits in the region @xmath21 .",
    "in the contour - improved perturbation theory@xcite , physical quantities @xmath22 are expressed in a series @xmath23 where @xmath24 is known by perturbation theory in loop expansion , and @xmath25 are expressed by the lambert w function .",
    "the result of running coupling using @xmath26 fits the data of @xmath27 data , except the peak around @xmath28 .",
    "[ alp32 ]    in the @xmath27 lattice in @xmath14 version , we obtained the kugo - ojima parameter @xmath29@xcite , trace @xmath30 and the horizon function deviation @xmath31@xcite .",
    "fundamental modular gauge ( fmg : global maximum of the optimizing function @xmath32)@xcite is the unique gauge known as the legitimate landau gauge without gribov copies@xcite , where @xmath33 .",
    "simulated annealing methods are now widely used to cope with gribov copies in the maximal abelian gauge@xcite . in the present work , we combine parallel tempering ( pt ) method as a new trial with gauge fixing for fmg , and test it in @xmath4 gauge theory on @xmath6 lattice with @xmath34 of the wilson action .",
    "the pt was invented as one of suitable methods for simulating correctly low temperature equilibrium of systems possessing complex energy profile like spin glass@xcite .",
    "we do not need the exact equilibrium of boltzmann distribution @xmath35 , but only the lowest energy state @xmath36 of @xmath37 efficiently where @xmath38 . in the pt method",
    ", we prepare @xmath39 replicas of site - spin ( gauge transformation ) system with gauge link interaction @xmath40 .",
    "each replica @xmath41 is given different @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "after @xmath44 monte carlo steps at the given @xmath45 , the @xmath45 s are exchanged between adjacent values according to metropolis acceptance check@xcite . during @xmath46 iterations of the @xmath45-exchange step ,",
    "the lowest energy state among all replicas is monitored and stored .",
    "these accumulated @xmath47 gauge spins are all fixed to the landau gauge by the standard over - relaxation ( or ) method ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we pick up the best copy among those , and name it as pt copy . in the pt method , the distribution of @xmath45 s in the interval @xmath49 $ ] is technically the most important point so that the exchange rates are almost equal everywhere between replicas",
    ". we found the good choice for adjustment of the new @xmath50 s from the old @xmath45 s as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the replica average of @xmath54 . due to the actual situation of our choice , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and",
    "the system size of @xmath6 , and @xmath57 , direct application of the pt is practically meaningless since the metropolis acceptance rate is very small .",
    "we dare to shrink the energy scale by a factor @xmath58 only within the @xmath45 exchange procedure to have the metropolice acceptance rate around @xmath59 .",
    "other parameters of ours are as follows , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "total number of pt gauge fixed samples of @xmath34 of @xmath4 wilson action is 67 , and we compared them with gauge copies that are directly gauge fixed by or method and are named as first copies . among 67 samples ,",
    "63 pt copies give larger @xmath63 with @xmath64 than first copies and the remaining 4 pt copies with @xmath65 .",
    "using these two groups of copies , gribov noise is investigated in kugo - ojima parameter , gluon propagator and ghost propagator .",
    "the averaged kugo - ojima parameter is suppressed about 4% in pt in comparison with first copy .",
    "effects of noise about 6% are seen in fig.4 for the ghost propagator , but no significant effects in the gluon propagator .",
    "for a few samples among 67 , comparison is made for each sample between two groups of @xmath66 pt generated copies , and 32 copies generated(crgt ) by direct or gauge fixing after random gauge transformation , in a scatter plot of kugo - ojima parameter vs @xmath63 .",
    "it is observed in this plot that a group of pt copies scatter almost in a line on top - end of @xmath63 , with all crgt scattering in lower @xmath63 area , and this fact raises questions if this `` flat - end '' feature is real one of the fmg , or if we have not reached the real fmg yet ?",
    "this is a rather unexpected feature with respect to fmg .",
    "the momentum dependences of the gluon propagator and the ghost propagator in the infrared are analyzed in use of pms method .",
    "deviation of @xmath67 from -1 ( kugo - ojima confinement criterion ) does not necessarily imply violation of colour symmetry .",
    "it could imply a question on the realization of brst quartet mechanism on the lattice and/or even further validity of the continuum lagrangian in the infrared region .",
    "so far as our data in off - diagonal elements of ghost propagator show , there appear no definite signals of colour global symmetry breaking .    from the scatter plot the kugo - ojima vs @xmath63",
    ", it seems that our pt gauge fixing works well , but more careful parameter tuning and comparison with simulated annealing method deserve a future study .",
    "gribov noise in the ghost propagator is qualitatively similar to cucchieri s noise at smaller @xmath68@xcite .",
