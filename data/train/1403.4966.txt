    "chess is arguably the most popular board game on this planet .",
    "there are numerous combinatorial problems inspired by chess , such as the non - attacking queens problem @xcite and the rich theory of rook polynomials @xcite .",
    "more related to the actual game of chess , noam elkies analyzed chess endgame positions using the theory of combinatorial games @xcite .",
    "our investigation in this article is in an entirely different direction . we search for an answer to",
    "the following simply stated question :    _ `` find the minimal number of moves needed for white to checkmate against a perfect opponent when playing on an @xmath0 board where the only pieces left are the two kings and the white rook '' _ .",
    "+ of course , white always moves first .    while the question of the _ minimal _ number of moves needed is not that important in the usual @xmath9 chess , since the fide rules generously allow @xmath10 moves , so white has to be an extremely weak player not be able to win . on the other hand in thai chess ,",
    "he ( or she ) is only allowed @xmath11 moves , so one has to be much more clever , and the present article may be useful even for the very special @xmath9 case .",
    "in any rook endgame position on an @xmath0 board , white can always checkmate within @xmath12 moves .",
    "the following elegant proof was kindly communicated to us by noam elkies .",
    "[ elkies ] in a rook endgame on an @xmath0 board , the winning side can checkmate within @xmath12 moves .",
    "( noam elkies ) assuming both @xmath1 and @xmath2 exceed 2 . [",
    "if @xmath13 or @xmath14 there are no checkmates at all ; if @xmath15 or @xmath16 then either the black king is already checkmated or no checkmate is possible  unless white castles on move 1 ... ] it is true that the method taught in most chess manuals takes time proportional to @xmath17 moves .",
    "but this can be reduced to @xmath12 by using the rook , supported by the king , to restrict the opposing king to an @xmath18 rectangle @xmath19 : it takes only @xmath20 moves to tighten the noose in one dimension or the other , decrementing @xmath21 to @xmath22 or @xmath23 to @xmath24 ; in @xmath12 moves , then , the king will be limited to @xmath20 squares near the corner , and then checkmate follows in another @xmath20 moves .",
    "it would be desirable to have explicit , and if possible , sharp , upper bounds for the needed number of moves .",
    "we use a symbolic finite state method analogous to the one used in @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize the importance of the _ methodology _ , that far transcends the actual results .",
    "i.e. that of rigorous experimental mathematics",
    ". we have a fully implemented algorithm , that completely does the proof without any human intervention !    the computer first generates the data from many @xmath25 boards , for _ numeric _ @xmath26 and @xmath2 .",
    "then it makes _ symbolic _ conjectures .",
    "finally the computer automatically proves these general ( symbolic ) conjectures _ all by itself_. we believe that this style of proof will be more commonly used in the future .",
    "in this section , we give an example of how the problem could be done on a @xmath3 board .",
    "however , it becomes much harder to handle wider widths .",
    "we fix some  natural \" positions on a @xmath3 board given by        the black king must be above the white king and the white king must be above the rook , as shown in the diagram . + @xmath21 is the distance between the black king and the white king .",
    "+ @xmath23 is the distance of the black king to the end of the board .",
    "+ @xmath27 is the distance of the rook to the other end of the board , but is irrelevant in the calculation .",
    "+ let @xmath28 be the column of the black king .",
    "+ let @xmath29 be the column of the white king .",
    "+ let @xmath30 be the column of the white rook .",
    "+ let @xmath31 be the number of moves needed to checkmate with the above initial position .",
    "+ we gives sharp upper bounds for all possible @xmath32 .",
    "the proof comprises of three steps , generating data , making conjectures and proving conjectures . +",
    "the claims are as follows .",
    "@xmath33    once we got the right set - up , the proof by induction on @xmath34 falls through naturally .    in order to illustrate our method",
    ", we will now present all the details , in a humanly - readable prose , for the inductive step for the first assertion above i.e. @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "of course , this proof was originally discovered by the computer , and the computer quickly does _ all _ the cases .",
    "once discovered , the computer proof is almost instantaneous , but _ discovering _ the proposed proof takes longer .    * base case : * verify that all the conjectures are true for @xmath37 + * induction step : * consider @xmath38 + * case 1 : * @xmath21 is even .",
    "white chooses to move his rook to the second column .",
    "black s only legal moves are to move his king up or down the first column . by the inductive hypothesis , in case the black king moves up , it would take at most @xmath39 moves to checkmate . in case",
    "the black king moves down , it would take at most @xmath40 moves to checkmate",
    ". therefore case 1 takes at most @xmath41 moves to checkmate . + * case 2 : * @xmath21 is odd .",
    "white chooses to move his king in an up - right direction .",
    "then the black king will be in check and must move to the second column . by the induction assumption ,",
    "it would take at most max@xmath42 moves to checkmate",
    ". therefore this case takes @xmath43 moves to checkmate .",
    "+ the proof of case @xmath44 is done .",
    "the rest of the proof is left to the readers , if they wish , but they may prefer to look at the ( humanly readable ! ) computer s full proof at    http://wannik.com/thotsaporn/rook.html .",
    "the present method was implemented using maple .",
    "the two programs , as well as sample output files , are freely available from :    http://wannik.com/thotsaporn/rook.html +",
    "we end this article with an ultimate conjecture suggested strongly by numerical evidences for small @xmath1 and @xmath2 , given in table 1 .",
    "+ let @xmath45 be the maximum of the minimal number of moves needed to checkmate from any initial position of a rook endgame on an @xmath0 board .",
