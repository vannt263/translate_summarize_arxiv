    "the modelization of fracture in disordered systems is a subject of great interest in natural and artificial materials @xcite . a time - dependent method to describe the failure of materials under stress , within the fiber - bundle paradigm ,",
    "was proposed by coleman @xcite . in this model a set ( bundle ) of elements ( fibers ) is considered with each element having a prescribed lifetime when subject to an applied stress ( load ) .",
    "when elements fail , their load is redistributed to other elements of the set according to a prescribed rule of transfer . as a consequence of the load transfer ,",
    "the lifetime of the receptors is actually reduced and the question is : how long does it take for the whole set to collapse ?",
    "these fiber - bundle models are called dynamical , or time - dependent @xcite , as opposed to their static counterparts , which have also been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "the rule for redistributing the load of failed elements can be wide , but there are two limiting cases . in the first , the stress of the failed element is transferred equally to all surviving elements ( els , for equal load sharing ) . in the second ,",
    "the load of the failed element is transferred to the nearest surviving element(s ) ( lls , for local load sharing ) .",
    "hierarchically organized transfer ( hls ) criteria are also of great interest @xcite .",
    "recently , these models have received much attention in the geophysical literature @xcite , because one would reasonably expect the emergence of universal scaling laws of the type observed in seismology @xcite . in this field ,",
    "the bundle is a representation of a fault , and the individual elements or fibers represent asperities on the fault plane .    in reference@xcite ,",
    "the els case is formulated in terms of a differential equation of the radioactive decay type .",
    "we have followed this perspective to devise a numerical probabilistic method to deal with any type of transfer rule . in section [ sec : themethod ] , we explain in detail the differences between the usual approach and the new probabilistic approach . in section [ sec : results ] , we compare results and present a brief discussion .",
    "suppose a set of @xmath1 elements identified on the sites of a supporting lattice .",
    "this information is contained in a list @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "this list is necessary , except in the els case , to know how to distribute the load of the failed elements .",
    "the broken elements are marked in @xmath4 . at @xmath5 ,",
    "all the elements of the set are loaded with a reference value @xmath6 . at any time , the total load acting on the surviving elements is constant , equal to @xmath7 .    to each element , @xmath8 ,",
    "one assigns a random lifetime , @xmath9 , under the unity of stress : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are random numbers between 0 and 1 .",
    "this choice implies a logarithmic distribution of lifetimes . a more general distribution function for the failure time of a single element subjected to a known load history @xmath12 is ( see , for example @xcite ) @xmath13d\\tau \\right ) \\right]\\label{twotwo},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the _ shape function_. the time integral in eq .",
    "( [ twotwo ] ) introduces a hazard rate @xmath15 known generally as the _ breakdown rule _ in terms of the instantaneous load level .",
    "experimental and theoretical work @xcite favors a shape function @xmath14 of the form @xmath16 known as the weibull shape function , with the particular choice @xmath17 giving the exponential shape function .    as for the breakdown rule ,",
    "two special forms are widely used in the literature : the exponential breakdown rule , @xmath18 and the power - law breakdown rule , @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 all positive constants .",
    "@xmath25 is called the weibull exponent because inserting eq .",
    "( [ twothree ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ twofive ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ twotwo ] ) mimics the static weibull distribution for the failure load of a single element .",
    "this parameter typically varies between 2 and 5 .",
    "the exponential breakdown rule , eq .",
    "( [ twofour ] ) has a characteristic failure rate , whereas the power - law breakdown rule is scale free and can be regarded as a local approximation to the former .",
    "following @xcite , we will use eq .",
    "( [ twofive ] ) as the individual breakdown rule in order to be able to compare the perfomance of the two approaches for load - transfer models . for further insights into the theoretical and experimental basis of the weibull shape function",
    "see @xcite , and for the breakdown rules see references @xcite and @xcite .    without losing generality",
    "one can choose @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ twofive ] ) , which means that @xmath27 is a measure of the failure rate ( @xmath28 , a unit failure rate under the unity of load is assumed ) . as @xmath23 is actually a frequency",
    ", @xmath29 is a dimensionless time variable and because of the particular choice @xmath30 , @xmath31 will hereafter stand for non - dimensional time .    if one substitutes eq .",
    "( [ twothree])and eq .",
    "( [ twofive ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ twotwo ] ) with the particular set of constants @xmath32 , we obtain @xmath33 which can be integrated for constant unit load @xmath34 to give eq.([one ] ) .",
    "when loads of failed elements are redistributed , the load acting on each element will no longer be the constant @xmath24 but will depend on time @xmath35 .",
    "thus we introduce a reduced time to failure for each element , @xmath36 , given by @xmath37^{\\rho}dt\\label{two}.\\ ] ] in the case of independent elements , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , load transfer occurs , and hence the actual time to failure of element @xmath8 , @xmath36 is reduced to below @xmath9 . by imposing the fulfillment of eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) , the successive order of breaking of the @xmath1 elements , one after the other , is easily identified and the total time of collapse is the @xmath36 of the longest lasting element .",
    "thus , in this approach the randomness , that is the population of lifetimes , is fixed at @xmath5 ( quenched disorder ) , and the breaking process is completely deterministic .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to this approach as the usual one .    in the new probabilistic approach presented here ,",
    "the fluctuations are generated during the breaking process and hence it is an example of so - called annealed randomness .",
    "an interesting question is whether the two types of disorder , namely quenched and annealed disorder , in these models lead to different results , as has been observed for some critical phenomena @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , newman _",
    "et al _ formulated the els mode in terms of a differential equation of the radioactive decay type .",
    "denoting the number of surviving elements as @xmath40 , its differential change is given by @xmath41 hence @xmath42 represents the decay rate .",
    "but in the els mode @xmath43 , hence @xmath44^{1/\\rho}\\ \\label{eight}\\ ] ] and @xmath45 .",
    "in this setting , fluctuations do not exist and one simply obtains mean values for the failure rate .",
    "following the perspective of the previous differential equation in which a group of elements , supporting the same load @xmath46 , fail at a rate @xmath42 or , in other words , have a mean - life @xmath47 , one can devise a probabilistic method for any transfer rule .",
    "the scenario would be a set of @xmath1 elements identified in @xmath4 , like a sample of radioactive nuclei fixed on a lattice , all having initially a decay rate @xmath48 .",
    "as time passes , failures ( disintegrations ) occur and this does not merely imply the effective disappearance of the failed elements , but also the modification of the decay rate of other surviving elements .",
    "the modification comes from the redistribution of load as accorded in the rule of transfer ( els , lls , etc ) , and the assumption that the decay rate of any element is given by its @xmath42 value . as in this strategy of calculation one",
    "has to proceed at discrete time intervals , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , the information of loads in the set will be contained in a list denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "the list is updated at each time step , together with @xmath52 .",
    "after @xmath53 time steps , there will have appeared subsets of elements .",
    "each subset is formed by all the surviving elements bearing the same load .",
    "we organise these subsets into sublists identified by the subindex @xmath54 , and denote the corresponding load by @xmath55 and the number of elements belonging to the sublist @xmath54 by @xmath56 .",
    "this information , which is obtained from @xmath57 , will be denoted by @xmath58 and updated simultaneously . at the beginning , as the load of all elements is 1 , the sublists are    @xmath59 if @xmath60 ,    @xmath61 if @xmath62 .",
    "now , it is clear that the simultaneous existence of several sublists in the sample , each with a different decay rate @xmath63 , poses a difficulty for an accurate description of the decay process of the whole set @xcite .",
    "the key point is the choice of the length of the time intervals , @xmath49 . to illustrate this problem , in fig.[figure1 ]",
    "we have plotted the detailed evolution of breaking of a hierarchical set of @xmath64 , coordination number equal to 2 , and @xmath65 . in abscisas one",
    "represents time , from @xmath66 to @xmath67 . in ordinates the spatial position of the @xmath1 elements of the set is represented .",
    "at @xmath5 all elements are sound .",
    "as time evolves , breakings ( represented by small crosses ) are produced and therefore the number of failed elements , represented by the continuous line , grows . at @xmath68",
    "the number of failures is @xmath1 .",
    "the height of the vertical spikes represents the load supported by an element at the time of failing . for short times",
    ", ruptures appear dispersed across the set and the rate of breaking is small .",
    "progressively though , there appear cracks formed by the failures of neighboring elements , and this makes the continouos line adopt steeper slopes .",
    "finally , the final breakdown occurs related to a big crack of a size similar to the whole system .",
    "this stage is also related to the high values of the spikes .",
    "the progressive acceleration of the breaking process is thus clear from this figure .",
    "therefore the time interval used in the probabilistic approach must be variable with time .",
    "otherwise , if one takes for @xmath69 a reasonable value for the beginning , the final part of the breaking will be badly described : in each @xmath69 , many elements will fail and the prediction of @xmath67 will be very inaccurate",
    ". on the other hand , if one chooses a @xmath69 typical of the final stages , it will be so short that although the calculation would be extremely good , at the beginning one would become bored awaiting the outcome of a breaking event .",
    "that is to say , these small intervals are not realistic for practical use .    it is for this reason that when one tries to devise an efficient numerical method to accurately describe the time evolution of the system , the choice of the time interval must be adjusted to the characteristic scale at which individual elements break in the process .",
    "this characteristic time scale , @xmath69 , as mentioned before changes with time , @xmath49 , and is implemented through the following definition @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a constant @xmath72 , independent of @xmath54 and of @xmath53 ; we will call it the time resolution parameter . the length of @xmath49 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ nine ] ) points , at each @xmath53 , to a specific sublist whose @xmath54 will be denoted as @xmath73 .",
    "now we define a probability of failure for each sublist , @xmath74    as @xmath75 is the failure rate for elements in sublist @xmath54 , @xmath76 is the expected number of casualties per element in sublist @xmath54 , @xmath28 , the probability of failure for sublist @xmath54 .",
    "the product @xmath77 is maximum for the sublist @xmath73 , in this case @xmath78 , which means that when the comparisons below([allequations ] ) are perfomed , elements belonging to @xmath73 are the most likely to fail . in particular if @xmath79 , one element of the @xmath80 sublist is likely to fail . for the other sublists ,",
    "the probability of an individual failure is lower than one .",
    "however , any element of any @xmath81 has a non - zero chance of failing in this probabilistic approach .",
    "we have called @xmath71 the time resolution parameter because if it grows the time intervals @xmath49 are smaller and therefore it is obvious that the process of failure is more finely resolved . then the probability @xmath82 is compared , for each element belonging to the sublist @xmath54 , with a random number , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .    [ allequations ] @xmath85 @xmath86    the elements that fail in any of the sublists transfer their load according to the rule of transfer and the information contained in the list @xmath52 . in the case that no element fails , a new time interval @xmath87 equal to @xmath49 is added and the same probabilities , @xmath88 , are compared with random numbers .",
    "this is repeated until at least one failure occurs which modifies @xmath52 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and hence @xmath49 . the total time to failure , @xmath67 , is the sum of the @xmath49 up to the disappearance of all the elements .    in the els case , @xmath49 can be explicitly written .",
    "after @xmath89 steps and assuming one failure per step , the number of surviving elements forming the unique sublist is @xmath90 , and the individual load is @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath92 note that we have used @xmath79 to be in accordance with the one failure per step assumption . in eq .",
    "( [ tenone ] ) one observes that , in the first step , @xmath93 , and in the last step , @xmath94 .",
    "now we proceed to sum up all the time intervals . in the continouos limit , we find @xmath95\\ ] ] which tends to the correct result @xmath96 in the limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "for the els case , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , we plot in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] the average of @xmath67 after the number of simulations expressed in the abscisas , for various @xmath71 .",
    "the horizontal lines comprise the extremes of the values obtained in 10 averages of 32000 simulations each by means of the usual method .",
    "one can observe , a ) the actual @xmath67 of this set is not @xmath99 as predicted by the differential equation , this being a finite - size effect ; and b ) @xmath100 is already sufficient in this method to reproduce the result of the usual approach .",
    "for the hls case , @xmath97 and coordination number of the cayley tree , @xmath101 , we show in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] the dispersion of @xmath67 emerging from the usual method ( squares ) and from the new method ( circles ) with @xmath79 .",
    "note the slight shift rightwards of the center of the gaussian , i.e , the values are longer .",
    "this is in agreement with what is seen in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . a greater value of @xmath71 would move the gaussian to the left up to the coincidence . in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , the averaged rates of breaking of a set of @xmath102 are plotted under the hls rule , @xmath101 , for two values of the weibull exponent @xmath65 and @xmath103 .",
    "we compare the habitual method and the new method for @xmath79 . in table",
    "[ table1 ] , a set of values of @xmath67 and their intrinsic width is shown for the hls case , @xmath101 , by varying @xmath1 and @xmath71 .",
    "data for @xmath102 , and @xmath104 are averages over 32000 , and 10000 realizations respectively .",
    "the errors quoted are one standard deviation of the mean .",
    "perhaps the most abrupt rule of transfer that one can imagine is that of the local one - dimensional unilateral model @xcite , where the load of failed elements is transferred to the nearest neighbor in the row going in one direction .",
    "this implies the almost immediate opening of big cracks and hence a great instability .",
    "the probabilistic approach for this model has been tested and again both methods coincide .    note that in the probabilistic method , there can be @xmath49 in which no element fails , and others in which several elements do .",
    "in contrast to the usual method , here no disorder is fixed at the start : we begin with @xmath1 elements , all with the same mean - life ; the random successive failures are responsible for the fluctuations , i.e , this is an example of annealed disorder . for a small value of @xmath71 ,",
    "the results emerging from the probabilistic method are already indistinguishable from those deriving from the usual method .",
    "so , we have numerically proved the equivalence of the two approaches .",
    "if @xmath71 is greater , the method demands more effort but the results reach a saturation point . comparing the respective disadvantanges of computing : in the probabilistic approach it is necessary to deal with larger sets of random numbers while in the usual method the set of stored data is much bigger .",
    "we conclude by quoting feynman who , in his original paper on path integral formalism @xcite , writes `` although it does not yield new results there is a pleasure in recognizing old things from a new point of view '' .",
