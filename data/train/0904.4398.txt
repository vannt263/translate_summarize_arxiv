    "studies of the solar corona ( sc ) have played a crucial role in understanding stellar winds in general . due to our privileged position immersed in the solar wind , researchers have had access to a great quantity of data that allow a detailed understanding of the physics that is operating in the sun .",
    "recent sophisticated observations , e. g. , via soho and ulysses , have shown that the sc is a highly complex system .",
    "it consists of long - lived features , like the fast and slow solar wind , streamers and coronal holes , and also of short - lived features , like the coronal mass ejections , solar flares and sun - spots .",
    "hence , if one could separate the long - lived structures from the short - lived ones , one could , in principle , come to a better understanding of the sc itself and other similar outflows . in the present paper ,",
    "we aim to investigate in detail the behavior of the long - lived coronal features in solar - like stellar winds",
    ".    direct measurements of tenuous coronal winds for other stars rather than the sun have proved to be very difficult to do , although indirect detections of stellar coronal winds have been performed @xcite . as it occurs in the sc , it is very probable that the magnetic field is playing an important role in coronal winds of solar - like stars .",
    "magnetic activity has not only been detected in other stars , but also in stars similar to the sun @xcite .    in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "a non - rotating corona expands spherically @xcite .",
    "a different picture , however , is expected if the magnetic energy density at the base of the corona is at _ least _ of the same amount of the thermal energy density .",
    "a particular case of equal magnetic and thermal energy densities was explored by pneuman & kopp ( 1971 , @xcite from now on ) for the case of the magnetized solar wind . by means of a numerical iterative method",
    ", they concluded that the sc is composed of two different magnetic structures in large scale : a region of closed magnetic field loops near the star at low latitudes and at high latitudes , open field lines that can not restrain the expanding gas .",
    "astrophysical outflows have long been studied @xcite .",
    "several analytical studies were made toward the understanding of an expanding magnetized corona .",
    "for instance , @xcite found a class of radial analytic solutions for magnetized steady - state winds by removing the latitude dependence of the problem . by varying the global magnetic field geometry and other parameters of their model , such as the velocity at the base of the wind",
    ", they analyzed the behavior of flows along open magnetic field lines .",
    "relaxed the assumption of a polytropic equation of state , but neglected the meridional component of the flow . found a new class of analytical solutions calculating the exact shape of a field line along the flow rather than assuming a global magnetic field geometry",
    "they showed that for a rotating young stellar object the shape of the field lines is an important parameter for the formation of a collimated jet / non - collimated wind . in a more recent work ,",
    "constructed exact solutions for a rotating , magnetized wind .",
    "they verified that the wind is highly non - spherically symmetric .",
    "however , as they pointed out , their model has limitations , as , for instance , meridional flows and the meridional component of the magnetic field were neglected .",
    "meanwhile , numerical studies were carried out with increasing level of sophistication .",
    "@xcite studied the influence of the stellar rotation on the wind structure and acceleration performing 2d simulations .",
    "solar wind parameters were used , except for the uniform angular velocity at the surface of the star that was varied as to analyze the effects of the centrifugal force .",
    "they showed that if the angular velocity is increased more than ten times the solar value , the centrifugal force becomes comparable to the thermal force , influencing the meridional structure of the wind .",
    "presented detailed one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) ideal mhd numerical simulations of a polytropic , axisymmetric wind . in a posterior work ,",
    "@xcite modeled stellar axisymmetric rotating outflows by solving the ideal mhd equations , investigating the effects of open and closed magnetic field lines in the wind . by varying the extension of the closed field line region , as well as the intensity of the magnetic field",
    ", they showed that the global wind structure is modified .",
    "@xcite , working towards the modeling of hot - star winds , presented a simulation of the solar wind using time - dependent , axisymmetric , mhd simulation .",
    "he showed that the mhd modeling was consistent with the work of @xcite .",
    "modeling the propagation of a coronal mass ejection from the inner solar corona to 1 au , @xcite numerically reproduced the steady - state bi - modal nature of the solar wind with a prescribed _ ad - hoc _ heating mechanism .",
    "working on the modeling of the solar wind , @xcite simulated the 3d structure of the solar wind under steady - state conditions , using solar magnetogram data as input parameters for the initiation of the wind , and considering a variable heating mechanism .",
    "@xcite extended @xcite s work considering , as a heating mechanism , a radial dependence of the ratio of specific heats , @xmath11 , as to reproduce the observed bi - modality of the velocity of the solar wind .",
    "despite all the notable evolution of both analytical and numerical studies performed in the last decades , we are far from a satisfactory 3d mhd description of a magnetized wind .",
    "several approximations were made in order to make the system analytically and numerically tractable ( e. g. , neglecting meridional flows , assuming a polytropic equation of state , assuming a magnetic field topology ) .    in the present study ,",
    "we investigate the influence of the magnetic field in solar - like stellar winds with different plasma-@xmath0 ( the ratio between thermal and magnetic energy densities ) .",
    "we solve the fully 3d mhd equations with the temporal evolution of the energy equation .",
    "therefore , the topology of the field is not restricted and the steady - state arises from the dynamical interplay of the outflow and the field . also , meridional flows arise naturally in the system .",
    "we neglect the stellar rotation .",
    "the results presented here are thus valid for non - rotators or slow rotators in the region where the toroidal component of the field is still much smaller than the poloidal component .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we present the numerical scheme used and in  3 , the results obtained .",
    " 4 is dedicated to conclusions and discussion .",
    "to perform the simulations , we make use of the block adaptive tree solar - wind roe upwind scheme ( bats - r - us ) , a three - dimensional mhd numerical code developed at the center for space environment modeling at university of michigan @xcite .",
    "bats - r - us uses a computational domain that is block - based , consisting of cartesian blocks of cells that can be adaptively refined .",
    "it has been widely used to simulate the earth s magnetosphere @xcite , the heliosphere @xcite , the outer - heliosphere @xcite , coronal mass ejections @xcite , and the magnetosphere of planets @xcite , among others . in this work , we adapted the version for the outer heliosphere @xcite to study the problem of the wind of a solar - like star .",
    "the code solves the ideal mhd equations , that in the conservative form are given by @xmath12 @xmath13 = \\rho { \\bf g}\\ ] ] @xmath14 @xmath15 = \\rho { \\bf g}\\cdot { \\bf u } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the mass density , @xmath17 the plasma velocity , @xmath18 the magnetic field , @xmath19 the gas pressure , @xmath20 the gravitational acceleration due to the central body , and @xmath21 is the total energy density given by @xmath22 we consider ideal gas , so @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath25 is the temperature , @xmath26 is the mean mass of the particle , and @xmath1 is the ratio of the specific heats .    due to the lack of knowledge of all the detailed processes that take place in a stellar wind , it is difficult to estimate all the mechanisms that modify the heat content of the wind ( e. g. , conduction , radiation , mechanical dissipation of energy that is transferred to the plasma ) .",
    "mhd waves and turbulence are known to play an important role on solar wind acceleration and heating @xcite .",
    "for this reason , they are often included in stellar wind models as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the solar - stellar wind connection is usually made by scaling the observed solar wind characteristics ( e.g. , the wave flux and spectral slope , solar magnetograms ) to other stars .",
    "however , it is not clear how these characteristics scale to other solar - like stars , in this first analysis we start with a simpler treatment of the mechanisms of acceleration of the wind .",
    "we adopt , therefore , an approach similar to @xcite who considered that @xmath1 is associated with `` turbulent '' internal degrees of freedom , in a way analogous to the sun , where a significant amount of energy is stored in the form of waves and turbulent fluctuations .      for all the simulations done",
    ", we adopted the same grid resolution .",
    "initially , the simulation domain is refined in five levels .",
    "other five refinement levels that are body - focused and focused on the equatorial plane ( current sheet region ) are applied next .",
    "finally , an additional level is applied to the body .",
    "there are @xmath27 cells in the domain .",

    "the simulation domain is initialized with a solar - like star at its center with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the grid is initialized with a 1d hydrodynamical ( hd ) wind for a totally ionized plasma of hydrogen .",
    "he initial temperature profile is set according to the value of @xmath1 adopted .",
    "this solution is dependent solely on the choice of the base temperature of the wind and the only physical possible solution is the one that becomes supersonic when passing through the critical radius @xcite . due to conservation of mass of a steady wind , we obtain the density profile from the radial velocity profile @xmath39 .",
    "initially , we chose a coronal base temperature of @xmath40  k and a base density of @xmath41  g  @xmath42 ( we vary @xmath43 in the second and third sets of simulations presented later on ) .",
    "the simulations are initialized with a bipolar magnetic field configuration described in spherical coordinates @xmath44 by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the magnetic field intensity at the poles , @xmath47 is the radial coordinate , @xmath48 is the co - latitude , and @xmath49 is the azimuthal angle measured in the equatorial plane . the system is then evolved in time until steady - state is achieved .      the inner boundary of the system is considered to be the base of the wind at @xmath50 and its conditions are dependent on local flow conditions : plasma can freely leave the reservoir ( i.e. , the base of the coronal wind ) , but no  backflow \" is allowed .",
    "fixed boundary conditions were adopted at @xmath50 .",

    "the magnetic field can be written in terms of a normalized field @xmath204 with a normalization constant @xmath46 @xmath205 doing the the same for the density @xmath206 in this case , eqs([eq : continuity_conserve ] ) to ( [ eq : energy_conserve ] ) are written as @xmath207 @xmath208= \\tilde\\rho { \\bf g}\\ ] ] @xmath209 @xmath210= \\tilde \\rho { \\bf g}\\cdot { \\bf u } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath211 equations  ( [ eq : continuity_conserve3 ] ) and ( [ eq : bfield_conserve3 ] ) show that the normalized density profile ( @xmath212 ) and the normalized field profile ( @xmath213 ) are independent of the values @xmath43 and @xmath46 adopted at the surface .",
    "equations ( [ eq : momentum_conserve3 ] ) and ( [ eq : energy_conserve3 ] ) show that the choice of @xmath43 and @xmath46 ( or in other words the choice of @xmath214 , as we assumed the same base temperature ) appears explicitly in the momentum and energy equations . according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : continuity_conserve3 ] ) to ( [ eq : energy_conserve3 ] ) , it is expected that flows with same @xmath51 have the same wind velocity , magnetic field configuration , density profile , etc .",
    "although the normalized density and magnetic field profiles are the same if @xmath51 is the same in two different simulations , the mass - loss rates are different , where the value of the normalization constant @xmath43 has to be considered .    hence , by analyzing only the velocity of an outflow , one can not equivocally predict its physical characteristics at its base .",
    "our results indicate that there is a group of magnetized flows that would present the same terminal velocity despite of its thermal and magnetic energy densities , as long as @xmath51 is the same .",
    "this degeneracy can be removed if we consider the mass - loss rate .",
    "as the velocity profiles for two different magnetized outflows with similar @xmath51 are the same , the difference between the mass - loss rates of these winds comes from different density structures . to illustrate ,",
    "consider cases s01 and",
    "s09 with @xmath215 : both cases present the same velocity profile and magnetic field configuration ( although the intensity is not equal ) ; but the density , and consequently the mass - loss rate , of s09 is 400 times larger than s01 in the entire numerical domain .      throughout the present paper",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath60 . however , more realistic magnetized wind models compute the heating of the wind caused due to physical processes , as is the case of the 1d models done by @xcite , among others",
    ". however , inclusion of such processes , e.g. dissipation of waves or turbulence , in a 3d code is very challenging .",
    "we thus opted to parametrize the energy content of the wind by the use of @xmath1 .",
    "we investigate now how the wind structure will change if a different @xmath1 is considered .",
    "considering the cases s01/s09 and s02/s08 , where @xmath215 , @xmath217 , respectively , we performed simulations considering @xmath61 .",
    "this third set of simulations is presented in table  [ table:1 ] and the meridional cuts of the steady - state configurations for s01b and s02b are shown in fig .",

    "[ ss.thirdset],title=\"fig : \" ] + , but for simulations s01b and s02b , where @xmath61 .",
    "[ ss.thirdset],title=\"fig : \" ]    it is worth noting that by adopting a different @xmath1 , the acceleration mechanism of the wind changes , what changes the velocity profile of the wind and , consequently , the configuration of the magnetic field ( compare , for instance , the steady - state configuration of s01 and s01b ) .",
    "this is expected because , the higher @xmath1 is , the thermal acceleration mechanism is less effective ( e.g. , there is less turbulence or dissipation of waves ) .    due to the scaling relations described in  [ sec.comp ] , simulations s01b and s09b , with @xmath215 , present the same configuration of the steady - state wind .",
    "the same result is achieved for simulations s02b and s08b , with @xmath218 .",
    "this is the first study to perform 3d mhd numerical simulations analyzing in detail winds of magnetized solar - like stars with different @xmath51 . as initial condition",
    ", our model assumes a bipolar configuration for the magnetic field at the stellar surface .",
    "this distribution of magnetic field , although very simplified , is useful as a first step in understanding how the interaction between stellar magnetic field and the wind occur in a 3d self - consistent manner .    in our simulations ,",
    "we adopt a simpler treatment and parametrize the energy content of the wind in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "this is a first step towards more realistic simulations .",
    "it should be stressed that if one aims to describe the complex physics of stellar winds , a more complete description of the energy content of the wind has to be taken into account . in the solar corona , for instance",
    ", it is inferred that closer to the sun , @xmath219 @xcite , and at @xmath2  au , @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 is not expected to be constant throughout the stellar wind , as we assumed . as the aim of our study is to investigate the effects of the magnetic fields in the general properties of the stellar wind ,",
    "the inclusion of mhd waves or variable @xmath1 is postponed for future work .    in the first set of simulations where a fixed heating parameter @xmath221 was adopted",
    ", we showed that for a solar - like star , the increase in the magnetic field intensity creates faster winds , with general characteristics as the @xcite result for the sun : a creation of a bi - modal stellar wind .",
    "the final configuration of the magnetic field consists of a zone of closed magnetic loops at low latitudes . on top of the closed loop region",
    "lies the neutral point , where the reconnection takes place and is the starting point of the current sheet that extends for larger distances along the equatorial plane .",
    "the zone of open field lines located at high latitudes of the star fills all the space outside the closed loop region and carries along a wind .    for a given @xmath51 ,",
    "the wind is more accelerated in the polar regions than in the equatorial region .",
    "this difference is generated by the latitude - dependent lorentz force which creates a flux of matter directed to the equatorial plane .",
    "this generates a density enhancement at low latitudes providing a mass - loss rate per unit solid angle that is also latitude - dependent and increases at low latitudes .",
    "this meridional flux is intensified for higher magnetic fields .",
    "the increase in the magnetic field also led to hotter winds with higher mass - loss rates .",
    "we showed that the @xmath0-parameter is a key parameter in the structure of the wind in the case @xmath1 is the same for all simulations .",
    "as @xmath51 was increased back to @xmath2 by changing @xmath43 and maintaining @xmath10  g in the second set of simulations , the wind decelerated and cooled . comparing the first and second sets of simulations ,",
    "we conclude that winds with same @xmath51 have i ) same velocity profile and ii ) same magnetic field topology ( the neutral point is located at the same position ) .",
    "however , mass - loss rates are different as @xmath222 is dependent on the choice of @xmath43 .    by analyzing the effects of a different @xmath1 in the simulations",
    ", we showed in the third set of simulations that the heating parameter @xmath1 is , together with the plasma-@xmath0 parameter at the coronal base , an important parameter in the structure of the wind .",
    "however , the steady - state configuration of the wind in the third set is different from the first and second ones because the thermal force driving the wind changes when @xmath1 changes .    in the simulations we ran , we adopted @xmath221 in the first and second sets , and @xmath61 in the third set .",
    "although @xmath1 is necessary for the thermal acceleration of the wind , a wind with a low @xmath1 implies a proportionally high lorentz force , when compared to the thermal force . for this reason ,",
    "the third set of simulations is more asymmetrical than the first set ( compare s01 and s01b , s02 and s02b ) , since the lorentz force is @xmath48-dependent .",
    "another aspect is that in a purely hd coronal wind , the thermal force is the main responsible for the acceleration of the wind .",
    "this implies that by adopting a low @xmath1 , the wind has less internal energy available , being less thermally accelerated . in the cases s01 ( @xmath221 ) and",
    "s01b ( @xmath61 ) , the same situation holds : case s01b is less accelerated than case s01 .",
    "however , cases s02 ( @xmath221 ) and s02b ( @xmath61 ) show a different behavior .",
    "the present simulations indicate that a change in gamma from @xmath65 to @xmath81 decreases the terminal speed by @xmath223 in cases s01/s01b and increases @xmath224 in cases s02/s02b . this different behavior is because in case s02b",
    ", the lorentz force provides a significant acceleration mechanism for the wind , i.e. , the lorentz force is proportionally more important than the thermal force .",
    "this illustrates the need for perform full 3d mhd simulations in order to assess the importance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the effective temperature of solar - like stars is orders of magnitude lower than the coronal temperature adopted in our models . in the present work , we did not take into account what is heating the wind from photospheric temperatures up to coronal temperatures .",
    "instead , we placed the inner boundary of our model at the coronal base . for a more realistic study ,",
    "however , the energy equation should be solved starting from lower layers .",
    "hence , the plasma-@xmath0 parameter at the coronal base would then be incorporated as resultant from the energy interactions happening in these lower layers rather than being a free parameter at the coronal base , as in our models .",
    "models and 1d simulations that resolves the energy balance in the chromosphere - corona transition region have been calculated recently for the solar wind @xcite and stellar winds @xcite .",
    "if incorporated in 3d global simulations , these models can provide physical insights on the processes that accelerate and heat stellar winds .",
    "the present work considered moderate @xmath51 . in the presence of a weak magnetic field ( high @xmath51 ) ,",
    "the wind is energetic enough to drag the field lines with it , leading to a configuration of radial magnetic field lines .",
    "consequently , a spherical expansion of the corona is expected , similar to a purely hd case .    here",
    ", we deal with a class of non - rotating stars . the validity of our results should be tested also in rotating objects , since a more generalized description of magnetized outflows from solar - like stars requires the inclusion of rotation .",
    "the detailed interaction including rotation requires detailed 3d mhd simulations .",
    "a future work will extend the present work to this direction .",
