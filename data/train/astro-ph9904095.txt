    "the globular clusters ( gcs ) are among the oldest known objects in the universe and can be considered as fossils of the formation of galaxies .",
    "gcs are simple coeval stellar systems which formed on a very short timescale during phases of intense star formation in galaxies .",
    "they are therefore more easily understood than mixed stellar field populations in a galaxy .",
    "the presence of globular cluster systems ( gcss ) around most of the galaxies as well as the well known correlations found between some of their characteristics and those of the parent galaxies suggest that the formation of a galaxy and of its gcs are closely related ( e.g. harris @xcite , djorgovski & santiago @xcite ) .    the alternative scenarios for the formation of early - type galaxies can be divided into two classes : the classical , long - lived scenario of a monolithic collapse which occurred in the early times of the universe ( e.g. larson @xcite ) and the scenario issued from the hierarchical models of galaxy formation where the galaxies are formed through galaxy mergers ( kauffmann @xcite , baugh et al .",
    "@xcite ) . during the unique collapse or for each major",
    "merging involving gas rich components , an intense star formation is expected with the likely formation of gcs .",
    "indeed , it has been verified by the discovery of numerous proto - globular clusters by the hubble space telescope in recently merging galaxies ( and starbursting galaxies ) in addition to the old ones from the progenitors ( schweizer @xcite for a review ) : it demonstrates that gcs trace the major events in the star formation of the parent galaxy .",
    "the consequences of the latter scenario on the gcss have been extensively investigated by ashman and zepf ( 1992 ) . to date the case of the _ brightest _ elliptical galaxies located in rich clusters is by far",
    "the best studied .",
    "a simple monolithic formation of these galaxies seems now to be ruled out by the observation of several sub - populations of gcs around these objects , indicating a more complex formation ( e.g. geisler et al .",
    "@xcite , forbes et al .",
    "traces of merging is very frequent in these systems and merging has probably played a role in the galaxy formation and/or evolution .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies of gcs around ngc 1399 ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "@xcite ) and m 87 ( cohen et al .",
    "@xcite ) show that they probably formed massively in the early phases of the formation of these galaxies with a small contribution of recent events .",
    "however the case of cluster ellipticals may well not be appropriate to disentangle the models of galaxy formation since the hierarchical models also predict that the cluster ellipticals formed at relatively high redshift ( e.g. kauffmann @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the case of field galaxies seems more interesting since the predictions of each model differ significantly for this class of objects .",
    "the hierarchical models predict their formation in recent dissipational mergers of gas - rich structures ( e.g. baugh et al .",
    "@xcite ) which differ a lot from an early unique collapse .",
    "early - type field galaxies with intermediate or low - luminosity are even more interesting",
    ". they might be the product of disk galaxies smaller than those involved in the formation of bright ellipticals ( kauffmann & charlot @xcite ) .",
    "indeed they generally exhibit a disky structure which is consistent with a formation in a dissipational merger of gas rich systems ( faber et al .",
    "@xcite , bender @xcite ) nevertheless the presence of gas during the merging is crucial to form new stars .    unfortunately , the low - luminosity isolated early - type galaxies are by far less studied than the bright cluster ellipticals . in general",
    "they show no obvious hint of a past merger event ( kissler - patig @xcite ) . until now ,",
    "the few photometric studies of the gcss around low - luminosity early - type galaxies are compatible with a single population and no complex formation ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "but in most cases the low sensitivity of the colors used to estimate parameters like metallicity or age prevents a definitive conclusion .",
    "in this paper we present the study of the gcs of the isolated , low - luminosity s0 galaxy ngc 7457 .",
    "it is a disky galaxy ( michard & marchal @xcite ) and its central light distribution is fitted by a power - law without evidence for the presence of a core ( lauer et al .",
    "this galaxy does not show any trace of past interactions or merging ( schweizer & seitzer @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless a steep central power - law in a disky galaxy can be the consequence of dissipative merging of gaseous galaxies ( bender @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the gcs around ngc 7457 may well have kept some traces of some merger events .",
    "it is in this context that we have undertaken the study of gcs around this galaxy .",
    "the main characteristics of ngc 7457 are presented in table 1 .",
    "deep b , v and i photometry will allow us to investigate the luminosity function of the gcs around this galaxy , to estimate the total number of gcs and the specific frequency and to study the color distribution of the gcs .",

    "the background contamination can been estimated when the density profile reaches a constant value .",
    "practically this occurs for galactocentric distances larger than 200 arcsec .",
    "the average of the counts in the five last rings ( table 4 , column 5 ) gives @xmath4 in agreement with the deep counts down to @xmath5 mag , our 80% limit completeness ( peterson et al .",
    "@xcite , tyson @xcite ) . after applying corrections for incompleteness",
    ", the total number of objects down to this magnitude is estimated to be @xmath6 .",
    "the background is subtracted statistically over an area of @xmath7 ( thus @xmath8 objects ) and we are left with a total of @xmath9 gc candidates .",
    "the density profile of the gcs follows the galaxy light profile .",
    "the fit of a power - law on the profiles ( @xmath10 ) gives @xmath11 for the gc density profile and @xmath12 for the galaxy light profile .",
    "we used all the data points except for the first bin for which we do not estimate the error .",
    "such a slope ( @xmath13 ) for the gc profile of ngc 7457 whose absolute v magnitude is -19.55 mag is in agreement with the correlation found between this slope and the absolute magnitude of the parent galaxy , fainter galaxies having a steeper distribution of gcs ( e.g. harris @xcite , kissler - patig @xcite ) .",
    "a similar profile for the galaxy light and the gcs seems not to be the rule for bright ellipticals ( e.g. ashman & zepf @xcite ) but the case of low - luminosity early - type galaxies is less clear since very few data are available for them .      to compute the globular cluster luminosity function",
    "we would need to consider only genuine gcs . to this aim",
    ", we use the gc candidates selected in section 3 from v and i detections .",
    "we have to account for incompleteness effects due to the magnitude limits in v and i. the range of v - i colors for the gc candidates is estimated from the models of worthey namely @xmath14 . since the gc candidates are first detected in the v band , we apply a selection which ensures the full range of possible v - i color for each detected candidate . with a completeness limit ( 50% ) at 22.45 mag for i and 23.95 mag for v",
    "we are limited by the i detections and we have to truncate the sample at v=23.25 mag which is reduced to 65 gc candidates .    the gclf is shown for v@xmath15 23.25 mag in figure 4 .",
    "a gaussian distribution has been fitted to the bins not affected by incompleteness .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian are @xmath16 mag for the mean and a dispersion of @xmath17 mag .",
    "the mean value that we find is fully consistent with a mean absolute magnitude @xmath18 mag for the distance modulus of ngc 7457 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the dispersion we find for the gclf of ngc 7457 is marginally consistent with those found in galaxies like m 31 or the milky way with @xmath19 mag whereas for bright ellipticals the dispersion seems larger with @xmath20 mag ( e.g. ashman & zepf @xcite ) .",
    "the number of gcs in an early - type galaxy has been found to scale with the parent galaxy luminosity ( e.g djorgovski & santiago 1992 ) . therefore following harris & van den bergh ( 1981 ) the gc counts are normalized per absolute visual magnitude of @xmath21 mag and a specific frequency",
    "is defined as @xmath22 where n is the total number of gcs in the galaxy and @xmath23 its absolute visual magnitude .",
    "@xmath24 is a measure of the gc efficiency .",
    "@xmath25 is found to be @xmath26 for most early - type galaxies with @xmath27 although with a large dispersion .",
    "brighter early - type galaxies exhibit in average a larger @xmath25 , some giant ellipticals in rich clusters having a very large specific frequency @xmath28 ( kissler - patig @xcite ) .    in the section 4.1 we estimated the total number of gcs down to @xmath29 mag .",
    "then integrating over the entire luminosity distribution of the section 4.2 we deduce a total number of @xmath0 clusters .",
    "this translates to a specific frequency @xmath1 assuming an absolute v magnitude @xmath30 mag for ngc 7457 .",
    "we can compute in the same way the specific frequency from the number of detected gc down to v = 23.1 mag ( the turn - over of the gclf ) and , after multiplying by two , we are left with @xmath31 objects thus @xmath32 .",
    "now we study the v - i and b - i color distributions of the gcs around ngc 7457 in order to search , if any , the presence of sub - populations with different metallicities .",
    "indeed the b - i color and in a lesser extent the v - i color are sensitive to the metallicity provided that the gcs are old ( @xmath33 gyr ) . in case of old stellar populations these two colors are poor tracers of the age of the stellar populations ( worthey @xcite , kissler - patig et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "first we need to calibrate the v - i and b - i colors as a function of the metallicity .",
    "empirical relations based on the observation of the milky way ( mw ) gcs are commonly used ( e.g. couture et al .",
    "@xcite ) but these relations become very insecure outside the metallicity range of the mw gcs ( @xmath34 \\le -0.5 $ ] ) .",
    "kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have extended the comparison between v - i and the metallicity deduced from spectroscopic data to higher metallicities thanks to their observations of ngc 1399 and found a flatter relation of @xmath3 $ ] as a function of v - i than when only the mw gcs are considered . in this paper",
    ", we will adopt the relation of kissler - patig et al .",
    "( @xcite ) : @xmath35 = ( -4.50\\pm 0.30 ) + ( 3.27\\pm 0.32 ) ( v - i)\\ ] ]    for the relation between the b - i color and the metallicity of gcs we re - analyse the problem by using the data on the mw clusters ( harris 1996 , mcmaster database ) together with the synthesis models of worthey ( 1994 ) for old stellar populations ( @xmath33 gyr ) with a large range of metallicities ( @xmath34 \\le 0.5 $ ] ) .",
    "we consider only old ages for the models in order to be consistent with the age of the mw gcs .",
    "therefore , the calibration relation will be valid for old stellar populations only ( @xmath33 gyr ) . when comparing the colors listed in worthey ( 1994 ) with the observed mw gcs , a small shift in color is needed .",
    "assuming an average age of 12 gyr for the mw gcs , we get a slight correction ( -0.09 in v - i , -0.14 in b - i ) to apply to the models .",
    "these corrections are in reasonable agreement with the color shifts suggested by worthey .",
    "the data are presented in figure 5 .",
    "a linear regression gives :    @xmath35 = ( -5.34\\pm 0.42 ) + ( 2.44 \\pm 0.30 ) ( b - i)\\ ] ]    given the uncertainties about these calibration relations , we have checked that our results do not depend on the exact choice of the conversion formulae .",
    "indeed we have used different relations like those of couture et al . for both v - i and b - i as well as the relation we find between [ fe / h ] and v - i following the same method as described in the last paragraph ( mw data and synthesis models ) .",
    "the v - i color histogram is reported in figure 6 for the sample of 65 gcs with @xmath36 mag ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "the distribution is found unimodal using the kmm mixture - modeling algorithm ( ashman et al .",
    "the gaussian distribution fitted on the data has a mean @xmath37 mag and a standard deviation @xmath38 mag .",
    "we can also estimate the mean and standard deviation using maximum likelihood estimators ( pryor & meylan @xcite ) , this method has the advantage of being performed without any hypothesis on the shape of the distribution .",
    "we find very similar results i.e. @xmath39 mag and @xmath40 mag .",
    "therefore the observed standard deviation is only slightly larger than the mean internal photometric error for the sample ( @xmath41 mag ) . +",
    "a mean @xmath42 mag translates to @xmath43>\\ = -1.1 $ ] dex . with an absolute v magnitude of -19.55 for ngc 7457",
    "such a mean is consistent with the correlation found between the absolute magnitude of the parent galaxy and the mean metallicity of the gcss ( e.g. ashman & zepf @xcite ) .      to compute the b - i color distribution we have to select gc candidates detected in v and with a measured magnitude in i and b. given the deepness of the v detection as compared to the i and b ones , the resulted sample is equivalent to a selection based only on b and i detections .",
    "once again we only keep objects with @xmath44 mag .",
    "we have also to be as complete as possible in the b and i bands for the analysis of the b - i color distribution . the range of b - i colors is estimated from the models of worthey used for the selection of the gcs candidates i.e. @xmath45 . as before , we adopt a completeness limit at 50% which corresponds to 22.45 mag in i and 23.9 mag in b. to ensure the full range of possible colors for each candidate detected in b we must truncate the sample at b=23.7 mag .",
    "the sample is reduced to 41 objects .",
    "the b - i color histogram is reported in figure 7 .",
    "the distribution is larger than for the v - i color but it is also found unimodal with the kmm test .",
    "such a result is expected since ashman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that a bimodality can not be easily detected with the kmm algorithm when the number of data is lower than 50 as it is the case here .",
    "the fit with a gaussian distribution gives a mean @xmath46 mag leading to a @xmath47=-0.8 $ ] dex consistent with the mean metallicity deduced from the v - i distribution given the uncertainties on the calibration relations ; the observed standard deviation is @xmath48 mag . using maximum likelihood estimators we find @xmath49 mag and @xmath50 mag .",
    "therefore the observed standard deviation of the b - i distribution is larger than the mean internal error @xmath51 mag .",
    "the v - i and b - i distributions of the gcs around ngc 7457 are found unimodal . before discussing the implications of this result we discuss in what conditions a bimodality would be really detected .",
    "first , as already discussed it is imperative to detect more gcs and therefore to perform a deeper photometry in at least two bands .",
    "moreover kissler - patig et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have outlined that , even if present , different populations of gcs are probably hard to discriminate in low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "a conspiracy between age and metallicity of the two populations could mimic a unimodal v - i distribution , the v - i color being very sensitive neither to age nor to metallicity .",
    "another difficulty is that even if the metallicity distribution of the gcs is bimodal the two peaks might be too close to be disentangled .",
    "for example forbes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have found a correlation between the mean metallicity of the metal - rich population of gcs and the luminosity of bright ellipticals whereas there is almost no correlation between the metallicity of the metal - poor gcs and the parent galaxy luminosity .",
    "if such a correlation also holds for fainter galaxies , their redder gc population will be less metal - rich and its color peak closer to that of their metal - poor gc population than it is the case in the bright ellipticals .",
    "therefore , the two peaks in the metallicity distribution , if they exist , will be hardly detected in these galaxies .    in order to investigate more quantitatively this effect",
    ", we can try to estimate what sort of bimodality is detectable with our data .",
    "ashman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have tested the bimodal detectability as a function of @xmath52 , the difference between the two means divided by the standard deviation of the two sub - populations supposed to have the same dispersion . for a total number of @xmath53 gcs",
    ", a bimodality is detected as soon as @xmath54 .",
    "if we adopt a typical @xmath55)=0.3 $ ] dex for each sub - population we find @xmath56\\ge 0.9 $ ] dex .",
    "however , we must note that this estimation is based on the assumption that the two sub - populations have the same number of objects . as noted by kissler - patig et al .",
    "( @xcite , see also section 6.2 ) , if there is not an equal number of gcs in each sub - population , they can not be separated when @xmath57\\sim 1 $ ] dex .",
    "$ ] dex corresponds to @xmath58 and @xmath59 mag according to the calibration formulae given above .",
    "thus , under these hypotheses , the two peaks might be separated .",
    "a 1-dex separation seems to a rough order of magnitude of what we may find in gcss .",
    "indeed , in bright ellipticals the difference between the two metallicity peaks approximately or slightly larger than 1 dex ( e.g. ashman & zepf @xcite ) . also , in the milky way , a similar gap has been measured between the metallicity of the halo and disk / bulge gcs ( armandroff & zinn @xcite ) .",
    "the bottomline is that with our data we can hope to separate two peaks of a bimodal distribution similar to those found around bright ellipticals or the milky way provided that the two sub - populations are roughly equally represented .",
    "any bimodal distribution with two metallicity peaks separated by less than 1 dex could not be separated .",
    "ngc 7457 is a s0 low - luminosity field galaxy .",
    "s0 galaxies are thought to be the continuation from disky ellipticals to early - type spirals in the hubble sequence ( kormendy @xcite ) .",
    "we can expect that s0 and disky ellipticals have been formed through similar processes .",
    "therefore this type of galaxy is particularly interesting for testing the scenarii of galaxy formation , in particular whether these galaxies formed in a dissipational merger event ( see section 1 ) .    the simple model of a spiral  spiral merger predicts several properties for the gcs of the remnant galaxy ( ashman & zepf @xcite ) : the newly produced gcs should rise the specific frequency by a factor of two",
    ", the new clusters and stars will be more concentrated than the gcs of the progenitors , and the new clusters should appear as a second population in the color distribution",
    ".    at face value ngc 7457 does not seem to confirm the hypothesis of a formation by spiral ",
    "spiral merging , at least when compared to the predictions of the simple model of ashman & zepf ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 7457 is found to have a rather low number of gcs steeply distributed around the galaxy , and the color distribution of these gcs appears unimodal .",
    "indeed , the specific frequency @xmath60 is compatible with the range observed in the four studied sa and sab galaxies ( ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 with a mean of 2.0 and a dispersion of 1.0 , taken from ashman & zepf @xcite ) .",
    "the surface density profile of the gcs follows the one of the stars ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "the absence of a recent merging event is suggested by the lack of any fine structure as defined by schweizer & seitzer ( @xcite ) for this galaxy .",
    "however two results might constrain formation theories . first the color distributions of the gcs appear broader than for a single population such as , e.g. , the milky way halo clusters .",
    "no clear bimodality has been detected .",
    "nevertheless given the poor statistics it has been shown in section 5.3 that it does not exclude necessarily the presence of distinct sub - populations . and ,",
    "second , the peak of the color distribution appears relatively red .",
    "does the unimodality of the color distribution imply the absence of two distinct gc populations ? in spite of the difficulties discussed in the section 5.3 , the narrow v - i distributions found in low - luminosity early - type galaxies ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "@xcite ) , together with a narrow luminosity function , can be used to exclude large difference in both metallicity and age within each galaxy , and therefore a recent gas - rich merger ( z@xmath151 ) ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the availability of the b - i colors for the gcs of ngc 7457 allows us to go further in the analysis .",
    "indeed the b - i color is roughly twice as sensitive to metallicity than the v - i color ( couture et al .",
    "@xcite ) . but",
    "an intrinsic difficulty with low - luminosity galaxies is their small number of gcs .",
    "bimodality was shown to be undetectable in a dataset containing less than 50 objects ( see section 5.3 ) . nevertheless , as we will see below",
    ", we can expect to observe some differences between the widths of a unimodal and a bimodal distributions .",
    "the dispersion in color of a `` single '' population of gcs can be estimated from the halo gcs of the mw .",
    "on the one hand , we can convert the metallicity dispersion into a color dispersion . with @xmath55)=0.3 $ ] dex ( armandroff & zinn @xcite ) we expect a @xmath61 mag and @xmath62 mag from the calibration relations of section 5 .",
    "on the other hand , we can measure the dispersion from the v - i and b - i data of the @xmath63 halo gcs in the mcmaster catalog ( harris 1996 ) , and obtain @xmath64 mag and @xmath65 mag in excellent agreement with the first values . in v - i ,",
    "the genuine dispersion in metallicity is extremely difficult to derive from the v - i colors , the expected dispersion being lower than the typical photometric errors of 0.1 mag . in b",
    "- i , however , typical photometric errors and intrinsic dispersion of a single population are comparable , so that several populations would broaden the color distribution to a detectable level .    in ngc 7457",
    "the dispersion in v - i is only slightly larger than the internal error ( 0.15 mag against 0.10 mag ) and we estimate that the true dispersion is @xmath66 mag according to the relation @xmath67 .",
    "this standard deviation in v - i translates to a @xmath68)\\sim 0.4\\pm 0.4 $ ] dex when using the calibration relation given in the precedent section .",
    "the error is estimated by accounting for the uncertainties on the determination of the standard deviations and on the calibration formula given in section 5 .",
    "the estimate is very insecure due to the large error on @xmath69 .",
    "+ for the b - i color we find a dispersion ( 0.25 mag ) clearly broader than the combination of a single population and photometric errors .",
    "the above relation leads to @xmath70 mag or @xmath68)=0.6\\pm   0.2 $ ] dex .",
    "this value is compatible with the value tentatively deduced from the v - i distribution .",
    "such a dispersion in metallicity seems intermediate between the one of a single population and the total dispersion of the gc populations in bright ellipticals .",
    "indeed single populations such as the galactic halo gcs ( armandroff & zinn @xcite ) , or the gcs around m 81 or m 31 ( perelmuter & racine @xcite ) have @xmath55)\\sim 0.3 $ ] dex ; the individual components of the bimodal distribution in ngc 4472 have similar dispersions of @xmath71 dex in @xmath3 $ ] ( geisler et al .",

    "@xcite ) .    therefore , while the distribution in metallicity of the gcs around ngc 7457 is found to be unimodal , the width of the gc metallicity distribution is compatible with the presence of different populations",
    "probably less separated in metallicity than in the giant clusters ellipticals .",
    "this suggests a significantly different chemical enrichment of the gcs in ngc 7457 than , e.g. , the halo population of the galaxy .      with @xmath72 and a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath73 dex for its",
    "gcs , ngc 7457 follows the general trend found between the absolute magnitude of the galaxies ( spirals @xmath74 ellipticals ) and the [ fe / h ] value of their gcs ( e.g. brodie & huchra @xcite , ashman & zepf @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the spirals seem to have a lower gc metallicity as compared to ellipticals of similar luminosity and the mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath75 dex for the gcs around ngc 7457 is consistent with the mean values found for the metallicities of the gcs around the bright elliptical galaxies ( @xmath76 , e.g. ashman & zepf @xcite ) .",
    "we can also compare more quantitatively the color distribution of the gcs around ngc 7457 with that of the galactic gcs .",
    "in addition to its broad dispersion , the mean b - i color found for the gcs of ngc 7457 ( b - i@xmath77 mag , see section 5.2 ) is comparable to the mean of the galactic disc / bulge gcs ( b - i@xmath78 mag , as derived from the mcmaster catalog ) .",
    "+ moreover , monte carlo simulations of b - i color distributions similar to ours show that any metal - poor ( b - i=1.55 mag , the mean color of the metal - poor clusters in the galaxy ) population as large as 20% to 30% of the metal - rich ( b - i@xmath79 mag ) one would be detected",
    ". therefore we can conclude to the absence of any significant population of metal - poor clusters similar to that of the mw halo .",
    "it is likely that such blue globular clusters were never present in ngc 7457 since ngc 7457 is an isolated galaxy ( @xmath80 ) and shows no signs of any interaction .",
    "thus the loss of blue gcs loss through stripping seems excluded .",
    "+ the formation in a spiral  spiral merger would imply the presence of blue gcs from the progenitor spirals unless the latter did not host blue gcs like the mw . in situ formation models",
    "usually explain blue gcs as formed in the early stage of the galaxy . to fit the absence of blue clusters in such scenarios an early epoch of star formation ( to enrich the gas ) without any formation of gcs would be required .",
    "+ we can also explore the possibility that the halo population of ngc 7457 and therefore of its progenitors in case of merging would be slightly redder than the mw one .",
    "for both the merger and accretion models , no variation of the color of the blue cluster population as a function of the parent galaxy luminosity is expected as it seems to be confirmed by forbes et al ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed their mean metal - poor peak @xmath43>\\ = -1.2\\pm 0.3 ~$ ] dex obtained for bright ellipticals translates to @xmath81 and v - i = 1.0 ( see also neilsen et al .",

    "such a bimodal distribution is consistent with our data since the two peaks could not be separated neither in v - i nor in b - i given the proximity of their colors ( see section 5.3 ) .",
    "+ finally , the absence of blue gcs around ngc 7457 could be explained in a scenario as the one advanced by ct et al .",
    "( @xcite ) where a galaxy forms gcs with a mean metallicity proportional to its luminosity and gains its metal - poor gcs by accreting smaller galaxies surrounding it . in this case",
    ", the absence of a significant number of metal - poor gcs in ngc 7457 could then be due to a lack of dwarf galaxies around this isolated galaxy .",
    "two galaxies already were reported to lack blue gcs : ngc 3923 and ngc 3311 .",
    "zepf et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have discussed various scenarios to explain the high mean metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = -0.56 dex ) and the very few clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 -1 dex around ngc 3923 , a luminous field elliptical .",
    "they propose several explanations around the merger picture , in which the number and metallicity of the clusters formed during the merging as well as those of pre - existing clusters around the progenitors might vary . finally more or less accretion of satellite galaxies and their metal - poor gcs can also modify the final color distribution of the system .",

    "( @xcite ) attribute the almost complete lack of blue gcs ( less than 10% of the gcs appear to have @xmath3<-1 $ ] dex ) to different history of pre - enrichment of the giant galaxy in the frame of an in situ formation of clusters .",
    "we have studied the gcs around the low - luminosity ( @xmath72 mag ) early - type galaxy ngc 7457 .",
    "several characteristics of the gcs are found typical for this type of galaxy : the specific frequency is found low with @xmath84 and the gc density profile is steep and follows the stellar light of the parent galaxy .",
    "the mean metallicity of @xmath43>\\ \\simeq -1 $ ] dex is compatible with the correlation existing between the metallicity of the gcss and the luminosity of the parent galaxies .",
    "the b - i and v - i color distributions are found unimodal but the b - i distribution is much wider than expected from a typical homogeneous population of gcs and consistent with what is expected for a bimodal distribution .",
    "the poor statistics ( 66 globular clusters in v - i and 41 in b - i ) prevents from a detection of two peaks in the metallicity distribution of the gc system if they are closer than 1 dex in [ fe / h ] and/or if the two sub - populations have a very different number of objects .    therefore our data are consistent with the presence of more than one population of gcs around ngc 7457",
    ". an alternative scenario would be a single gc population with a larger range in metallicity than found for homogeneous populations of gcs around the mw , nearby galaxies or bright ellipticals .",
    "no significant population of metal - poor gcs similar to the halo gcs of the galaxy is detected around ngc 7457 .",
    "several possibilities are discussed to explain this absence of gcs with @xmath3\\simeq -1.6 $ ] dex .",
    "deeper photometry would be necessary to detect more gcs and to be able to identify two peaks in the metallicity distribution of the gcs .",
    "another test of the hierarchical models of galaxy formation will be to estimate the age of the gcs since these models predict a rather recent merging for field early - type galaxies with @xmath85 .",
    "such a determination requires spectroscopic observations of the gcs but will be difficult if the merging occurred more than 5 gyr ago since spectroscopic indices as @xmath86 are not sensitive to higher ages .",
