    "different approaches to the basic structure of spacetime exist and in recent years there has been a growing interest in the notion of space or spacetime as an emergent concept . a natural setting where space or spacetime are necessarily emergent is in the proposed nonpterturbative definitions of string theory provided by matrix models @xcite . in this context plausible models of emergent geometry have been discussed @xcite . the notion of classical geometry changes drastically within the context of matrix models ; neither background geometry nor topology is predefined but instead they emerge dynamically as a consequence of the condensation of the matrix degrees of freedom to form the background geometry .    the purpose of this paper is to study the scaling of finite matrix effects for large matrix size ( large @xmath6 ) as the limit of stability of the geometry is approached .",
    "we consider an action in which the basic objects are simple hermitian matrices at finite temperature with a prescribed energy functional .",
    "the geometry exists at low temperatures as a condensate around which the system fluctuates .",
    "the energy functional of interest here is that of a 3-matrix model consisting of the trace of the square of the commutator of the matrices ( a yang - mills term ) plus the epsilon - tensor contracted with the trace of the three matrices ( a myers term @xcite ) . the system has been studied before in @xcite and with a mass deformation in @xcite .",
    "it is a static bosonic subsector of the bmn model @xcite .",
    "the model exhibits a geometrical phase for sufficiently low temperatures where the effect of the cubic myers term is important , with the geometry being that of a fuzzy sphere @xcite which is a non - commutative version of the commutative sphere .    at a critical temperature , which can be traded for a critical myers coupling , a phase transition occurs and the condensed geometry evaporates . in the geometrical , low temperature phase , small fluctuations around this condensate correspond to a @xmath7 gauge and scalar field multiplet @xcite .",
    "in previous studies @xcite it was argued that , as the transition is approached from the low temperature side , there are divergent fluctuations in the system and in particular that the specific heat diverges with exponent @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the system may exhibit finite size scaling @xcite in terms of the matrix size as the system size grows .",
    "we therefore study the growth of fluctuations , in terms of both temperature and matrix size , as the transition is approached from below , but insisting on remaining in the fuzzy sphere phase .",
    "the fluctuations we consider are those of a restricted ensemble and do not take into account the rare finite matrix transitions when the system jumps from the fuzzy sphere to the matrix phase .",
    "such fluctuations are completely absent in the large @xmath6 limit as is typical of matrix models where tunneling goes to zero as @xmath6 goes to infinity .",
    "our study shows that the fluctuations do indeed scale with matrix size .",
    "the principal results of this paper are :    * in the absence of fluctuations , the myer s term gives rise to an instability of the model .",
    "this is responsible for the destabilisation of the matrix phase for small matrices but insufficient to cause an instability for matrices of size @xmath8 approximately . *",
    "the transition is rounded by finite matrix effects and there is a pseudo critical temperature shifted from the infinite @xmath6 transition temperature with shift exponent which we predict on scaling grounds is @xmath1 . * the scaling form of the free energy with @xmath6 is a universal function of @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "we predict the scaling relation @xmath11 . *",
    "if we assume that @xmath12 , based on a fuzzy sphere background , and @xmath0 as found in earlier studies , then our theoretical prediction is that @xmath13 and if further we accept that the approach to criticality is governed by a divergent correlation length then we infer that the correlation length exponent @xmath14 . *",
    "hybrid monte carlo simulations give good agreement with finite size scaling in terms of the matrix size @xmath6 and assuming the asymptotic scaling form of the specific heat as the critical temperature is approached from below @xmath15 our best estimates from these measurements are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 where the peak in the specific heat grows as @xmath20 .",
    "these are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates based on scaling and @xmath0 .",
    "* when we assume the exponent @xmath0 and scaling so that @xmath1 and @xmath2 we find tight estimates for the shift amplitude @xmath21 and the specific heat maximum amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ",
    "2 we discuss the main properties of the model which are relevant to us . in section ",
    "3 we present the theory of finite size scaling . in section",
    " 4 we give an overview of the difficulties that arise in near - critical system simulations and the impact they have on our studies . in section ",
    "5 we present our numerical results . in section",
    " 6 we present our conclusions from the study .",
    "the model we shall consider in this paper is the three matrix model , which was studied in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 , @xmath24 , be three traceless @xmath6-dimensional hermitian matrices .",
    "we consider the action ( really an energy divided by temperature , as all our considerations will be in euclidean signature ) @xmath25=n tr\\big(-\\frac{1}{4}[x_a , x_b]^2 + \\frac{2i{\\ensuremath{g}}}{3}\\epsilon_{abc}x_ax_bx_c\\big ) \\label{eq:3mm_action}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol , @xmath27 is a parameter of the model .",
    "the change @xmath28 is equivalent to @xmath29 , therefore it will be sufficient to restrict our study to the case @xmath30 , which we shall assume .",
    "this model has a phase transition @xcite and it is the vicinity of this transition that is of interest to us here .",
    "the stationary points of the system follow from varying @xmath31 : demanding that @xmath32 results in @xmath33 - i{\\ensuremath{g}}\\epsilon_{abc } x_c ] = 0 , \\label{eq:3mm_em}\\ ] ] and every configuration of matrices @xmath23 that solves is a ( local ) extremum or saddle point of .    for most purposes of this paper",
    "it will be convenient to scale out a factor of @xmath34 and work with the parametrization @xmath35 , as this gives a phase diagram that does not dependent on @xmath6 .",
    "so we make the substitution @xmath36 in terms of which the action reads @xmath37=\\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\widetilde g}}^{4}}{n } tr\\big(-\\frac{1}{4}[d_a , d_b]^2 + \\frac{2i}{3}\\epsilon_{abc}d_ad_bd_c\\big ) . \\label{eq:3mm_action_temp}\\ ] ] from this it is clear that observables are symmetric under @xmath38 , or equivalently under @xmath39 . for @xmath40 we can interpret @xmath41 as a temperature for the system . , though it may be more convenient in some situations to use either @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "note that , as there are no dimensionful quantities in the action , @xmath44 here is dimensionless . ]    many of the physical properties are characterised by the expectation value of the action @xmath45 , the specific heat of the system and the distribution of the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath23 .",
    "our study here will focus on the first two .",
    "the specific heat is defined as @xmath46 for convenience we shall define @xmath47 , this is the internal energy divided by the temperature .",
    "the model has at least two phases , which we call the commuting matrix phase and the fuzzy sphere phase , and the above three quantities behave quite differently in these two phases . in a semi - classical approximation @xcite",
    "the phase transition occurs at @xmath48 this is remarkably close to our numerical result of @xmath49 obtained in ",
    "[ sec : tc ] .",
    "the high temperature phase of the model with @xmath50 is characterised by fluctuations around a ground state in which the three matrices are mutually commuting .",
    "this ground state can be represented by @xmath23 s which are linear combinations of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are in the cartan sub - algebra of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "any such linear combination is a trivial solution to , so the classical action vanishes for these stationary configurations .",
    "however , these solutions can be unstable if any of the eigenvalues get too close to one another , as we now demonstrate .",
    "fluctuations around a classical solution can be expressed as @xmath56 with @xmath57 three mutually commuting , hermitian matrices .",
    "we are free to perform an @xmath58 unitary transformation on @xmath57 to simultaneously diagonalise them , @xmath59 a little algebra reveals that , to quadratic order in @xmath60 we have @xmath61 ^ 2=   \\frac 1 2 \\left ( \\bigl(\\delta_{ij}.\\delta_{ij}\\bigr ) \\delta^{ab } -\\delta^a_{ij}\\delta^b_{ij } \\right ) \\delta x_{a , ij}\\,\\delta x_{b , ij}\\ ] ] and @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "stability of fluctuations around a classical solution are therefore determined by the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath64 where @xmath65 with eigenvalues @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the zero - eigenvalue is associated with the @xmath68 invariance of the action and can be removed by gauge fixing such that one of the matrices is diagonal . however , if some of the background eigenvalues , @xmath69 , are too close together , ( [ matrixfluctop ] ) has a negative eigenvalue , and hence an instability .",
    "in particular , if @xmath70 for any pair @xmath71 , @xmath72 , then there is a direction which is unstable .",
    "the solution is stable if all the eigenvalues of @xmath57 are far enough apart .",
    "note that there are no unstable directions for @xmath73 , the instability is induced by the myers term .",
    "fluctuations can of course modify this analysis .",
    "it is possible that they stabilise the unstable solutions .",
    "we will not attempt an analytic approach to this question here but will return to it later in the paper .",
    "the first immediate effect of fluctuations is that they modify the expectation value of the action and shift it away from @xmath74 . to study this effect",
    "consider a schwinger - dyson type analysis , @xmath75 tr \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_a } \\left(x_a e^{-\\mathcal s}\\right)\\nonumber \\\\",

    "thus we expect @xmath77 it is shown numerically in @xcite that @xmath78 at large @xmath44 and large @xmath6 so , in this limit , @xmath79 which is positive .",
    "this suggests that , in the matrix phase of the model , the specific heat does not depend on @xmath44 , @xmath80 and each degree of freedom contributes a value of @xmath81 to the specific heat .",
    "the model behaves like a pure yang - mills matrix model in the large @xmath6 limit , i.e. one with only the commutator squared term .",
    "for large @xmath6 , the eigenvalue distribution in this phase is compatible with a parabolic distribution @xcite . in a gauge",
    "in which @xmath82 is diagonal ( which can always be achieved by an @xmath83 transformation ) the diagonal entries of @xmath84 can be arranged in descending order and give a parabolic distribution with normalised density @xmath85 with @xmath86 determined numerically to be @xmath87 .",
    "this parabolic form of the distribution further implies , as argued in @xcite , that the background of commuting matrices have their eigenvalues distributed uniformly within a ball of radius @xmath88 .",
    "fluctuations around this background are still present and those of the different matrices do not commute .",
    "the fuzzy sphere phase is a cold ( ordered ) phase and is radically different to the commuting matrix phase .",
    "the background matrices in this phase are represented by a solution to in which @xmath23 are proportional the generators of @xmath89 , @xmath90 with @xmath91=i\\epsilon_{abc}l_c$ ] , up to @xmath68 transformation @xmath92 with @xmath55 . for the classical solution we have @xmath93 , with @xmath94 the second order casimir for the @xmath6-dimensional representation of @xmath95 , and hence @xmath96 more generally we shall define a radius of the fuzzy sphere , @xmath97 , by @xmath98 which",
    ", in the large @xmath6 limit , has a nonzero value only in the fuzzy sphere phase .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 provides an order parameter for the transition , being non - zero in the low temperature phase and zero in the high temperature phase .    for low temperatures below the transition the expectation value of the action in this phase",
    "is approximated by the value of the action for the solution @xmath90 , so that @xmath99 and @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the casimir and adjoint casimir operators of @xmath89 . since the matrices @xmath23 are proportional to the generators they have a discrete eigenvalue spectrum with @xmath6 distinct eigenvalues of the form @xmath103 .",
    "a closer examination of equation shows that there are reducible fuzzy sphere solutions , with @xmath23 proportional to @xmath89 generators in a reducible representation of the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 is an @xmath89 irreducible representation of dimension @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the matrices @xmath23 for this solution can always be chosen to have block - diagonal form and this will be implicit for the rest of this discussion .",
    "all of the metastable states with the n - tuple @xmath108 can be listed and indeed all the solutions described so far  even the commuting matrix phase and the irreducible fuzzy sphere phase  can be classified this way .",
    "for a fixed @xmath6 , the number of distinct solutions to ( [ eq:3mm_em ] ) of the form ( [ eq : excited_states_form ] ) grows as @xmath109 , the number of integer partitions of @xmath6 , which for large @xmath6 behaves as @xmath110 and for low enough temperatures the fuzzy sphere configuration represents the ground state of the system with each of the other @xmath111 configurations representing a potential metastable state .",
    "the special case @xmath112 corresponds to the commuting matrix phase and the ground state in this case can be viewed as arising from @xmath6 one - dimensional ( or trivial ) representations of @xmath89 . in the other extreme ,",
    "when @xmath113 , the representation is irreducible and gives the fuzzy sphere discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , the commuting matrix solution is genuinely different to all the others , the configuration represented by diagonal matrices is a state built from the one - dimensional representations so the @xmath114 term in plays no rle and the system has no memory of @xmath89 .",
    "these are one dimensional representations of an arbitrary algebra .",
    "there are two observables that could be used to distinguish between the fuzzy sphere from section  [ fuzzysphere ] and these excited configurations with @xmath115 .",
    "first we can use the eigenvalues of the matrices : since any irreducible representation @xmath116 of @xmath89 has @xmath117 distinct eigenvalues , configurations of the form have @xmath118 distinct eigenvalues in their spectra .",
    "another observable that is sensitive to the excited states is the expectation value of the action .",
    "we have @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "these excited states are unstable , see section  [ sec : excitedstates ] and far from the phase transition fluctuations around the lowest excited states are very much like fluctuations around the ground state ( see fig .",
    "[ pic : excited_states_cv_extraction ] ) and these fluctuations are small relative to the spacing between such states .",
    "so at very low temperatures these excited states do not play an important rle in the thermodynamics of the system .",
    "the considerations so far have been in the absence of fluctuations and apply , at low temperatures , sufficiently far from the critical point that fluctuations can be neglected .",
    "fluctuations are important in the high temperature phase due to eigenvalue repulsion which lifts the degeneracy of eigenvalues and stabilises the high temperature phase against the myers instability discussed in section  [ sec : commutingmatrixphase ] .",
    "otherwise at high temperatures fluctuations are not large .",
    "in the low temperature phase eigenvalue repulsion also lifts the degeneracy associated with identical @xmath89 blocks in the low temperature phase otherwise for all practical purposes the excited fuzzy states play no rle for sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "however , near the critical point as the transition is approached from the low temperature side fluctuations grow and the specific heat rises , see fig .",
    "[ pic : cv_broad_temp_range ] . in this regime",
    "the excited fuzzy sphere states will of necessity play a more important rle .",
    "one can estimate when the first excited state will be important by noting that it corresponds to @xmath122 and that the difference in action between this and the ground state grows linearly with @xmath6 , being @xmath123 for large @xmath6 .",
    "if the square of this difference divided by @xmath6 is larger than the specific heat then these excited states are unimportant , however , as the critical point is reached the specific heat grows and eventually all excited states are important . far from the transition @xmath124 , so we can estimate that the first excited state will begin to become important for @xmath125 .",
    "once the first excited state becomes important , there are more possibilities for fluctuations in the system and the specific heat in turn grows .",
    "more excited states enter the picture and eventually the system undergoes a phase transition . earlier estimates @xcite give this transition at @xmath126 .",

    "more detail on the impact of critical slowdown on our numerics is discussed in the appendix and here we merely observe that , for the systems studied in this work , the critical slowing down of our simulations has significant impact on systems with @xmath257 and has prevented us from simulating matrices with @xmath258 . that the relative error in the measurement of the near - critical specific heat grows with the system size . ]      another property to be taken into consideration is the presence of the excited fuzzy sphere configurations given by . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "those configurations possess energies which are intermediate between the commuting matrix phase and the fuzzy sphere phase .",
    "this means that , in the region where the two phases coexist , we would expect to see jumps between the ground state and these excited states and between these excited states and the commuting matrix phase rather than direct transitions between the commuting matrix phase and the fuzzy sphere ground state .",

    "we can see that the system spends roughly the same amount of mc time in both phases , an indication that the system is close to the transition point .",

    "one tactic to handle this problem is to perform a _ cold start _ on the monte carlo runs , so that the phase transition is always approached from the low temperature side .",

    "the matrix that is started first in the simulation is the one whose eigenvalue become non - zero and non - degenerate .",
    "a hybrid monte carlo simulation is necessary to overcome this difficulty and for our study we use the hybrid monte carlo algorithm of @xcite .",

    "this results in a vandermonde jacobian from the change of variables whose logarithm is included in the effective action .",
    "this algorithm is quite efficient for some simulations but simulations with a hot start find it much more difficult to relax to a fuzzy sphere phase even for very low temperatures and relatively large matrices .",
