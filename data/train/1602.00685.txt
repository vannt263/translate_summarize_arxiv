    "recent observations of the cosmic microwave background , large scale structure and type ia supernovae have provided strong evidence that at present epoch the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite . assuming that general relativity correctly describes the large scale dynamics of the universe",
    ", this means that the energy density is currently dominated by a form of energy having negative pressure .",
    "this type of a gravitational source is referred as dark energy .",
    "the simplest model for the latter , consistent with all observations to date , is a cosmological constant . from the cosmological point of view ,",
    "a cosmological constant is equivalent to the vacuum energy in quantum field theory .",
    "however , the value of a cosmological constant inferred from cosmological observations is many orders of magnitude smaller than the value one might expect based on quantum field - theoretical considerations .",
    "this large discrepancy is one of the motivations to consider alternative models for dark energy .",
    "to account for the missing energy density , instead of a cosmological constant one could add a new component of matter , such as quintessence ( see @xcite for a review ) . the latter is modeled by slow - rolling scalar fields . however , because of very small mass of a scalar field responsible for the acceleration , it is generally difficult to construct viable potentials on the base of particle physics .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that suitable modifications of general relativity can result in an accelerating expansion of the universe at present epoch .",
    "these modifications fall into two general groups .",
    "the first one consists of scalar - tensor theories that are most widely considered extensions of general relativity @xcite .",
    "in addition to the metric tensor , these theories contain scalar fields in their gravitational sector and typically arise in the context of models with extra dimensions ( kaluza - klein - type models , braneworld scenario ) and within the framework of the low - energy string effective gravity . in the second group of models ,",
    "the ricci scalar @xmath2 in the einstein - hilbert action is replaced by a general function @xmath1 ( for recent reviews see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "one of the first models for inflation with quadratic in the ricci scalar lagrangian , proposed by starobinsky @xcite , falls into this class of theories .",
    "an additional motivation for the @xmath1 theories comes from quantum field theory in classical curved backgrounds @xcite and from string theories .",
    "the recent investigations of cosmological models in the @xmath3 theories of gravity have shown a possibility for a unified description of the inflation and the late - time acceleration .",
    "@xmath1 gravities can be recast as scalar tensor theories of a special type with a potential determined by the form of the function @xmath1 .",
    "various special forms of this function have been discussed in the literature . in particular , the functions were considered that realize the cosmological dynamics with radiation dominated , matter dominated and accelerated epoch .",
    "unified models of inflation and dark energy have been studied as well noji11 . in the present paper",
    "we consider the qualitative evolution of the cosmological model for a general @xmath1 function .",
    "the general analysis is specified for various examples , including the original starobinsky model .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows . in the next section we present the action of @xmath1 gravity in the form of the action of a scalar - tensor theory in a general conformal representation .",
    "then , the general action is specified for the einstein frame with a scalar field having a canonical kinetic term .",
    "the specific form of the scalar field potential is given for various examples of the @xmath1 function .",
    "the corresponding cosmological model is described in section [ sec : cosm ] and the relations between the functions in the einstein and jordan frames are discussed .",
    "the qualitative analysis of the spatially flat gravi - scalar model is presented in section sec : qualit .",
    "the phase portraits are plotted for special cases .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the action in @xmath0-dimensional @xmath1 theory of gravity has the form@xmath4 ,   \\label{sfr}\\]]where @xmath5 is the lagrangian density for non - gravitational matter collectively denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite-@xcite ) that ( [ sfr ] ) can be presented in the form of the action for scalar - tensor gravity . in order to show that we consider the action@xmath7 ,   \\label{sfrb}\\]]with a scalar field @xmath8 .",
    "the equation for the latter is reduced to @xmath9 . assuming that @xmath10 , from the field equation we get @xmath11 . with this solution ,",

    "the action ( [ sfrc ] ) describes a scalar - tensor theory . in the representation ( [ sfrc ] )",
    "the lagrangian density of the non - gravitational matter does not depend on the scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the representation corresponds to the jordan frame .",
    "the scalar - tensor theories can be presented in various representations which are related by conformal transformations of the metric tensor .",
    "let us consider a general conformal transformation @xmath17with a sufficiently smooth function  @xmath18 .",

    "the function @xmath1 is of the polynomial form .",
    "a similar structure is obtained in the string - inspired models with the effective action expanded in powers of the string tension .",
    "however , it should be noted that in both these types of models coming from high - energy physics , the lagrangian density in addition to the scalar curvature contains other scalars constructed from the riemann tensor . in this context , the @xmath45 theories can be considered as models simple enough to be easy to handle from which we gain some insight in modifications of gravity . in some models proposed for dark energy the function",
