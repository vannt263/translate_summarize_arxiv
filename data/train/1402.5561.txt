    "for oxygen and calcium we used the pseudopotentials ( pps ) optimized by shulenburger and mattsson @xcite , who also demonstrated their good quality by performing numerous tests .",
    "of a much greater concern in the present study was the proper performance of the cu pp since the magnetic properties of ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3 are largely determined by the behavior of the cu @xmath13 electrons .",
    "therefore , we subjected our candidate cu pps to a comprehensive selection process , as presented below .",
    "the candidate cu pps were generated using the opium code @xcite .",
    "our final choice is the hard ne - core cu pp [ fig .",
    "[ f.ne_hardsoft ]  ( a ) , ( c ) ] that satisfies the most stringent accuracy criteria and thus ensures the validity of the bulk calculations .",
    "[ [ bulk - dft - calculations - and - rejection - of - ar - core - cu - pseudopotentials ] ] bulk dft calculations and rejection of ar - core cu pseudopotentials ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    using our hard ne - core cu pp , we are able to accurately reproduce with quantum espresso the lda results of the all - electron ( ae ) code wien2k @xcite for bulk ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3 in an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and a ferromagnetic ( fm ) states .",
    "thus , in fig .  [ f.dos ] the ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3 densities of states ( dos ) obtained from pp and ae calculations are compared , for an afm [ fig .",
    "[ f.dos ]  ( a ) ] and an fm [ fig",
    ".  [ f.dos ]  ( b ) ] cu spin configurations . for both configurations ,",
    "the agreement with the ae code is very good .",
    "interestingly , we were able to equally well reproduce the ae dos when also using properly optimized mg - core cu pps .",
    "this , however , did not hold for any of the ar - core cu pps we tried : in this case , the bandwidth of the pp states as well as the conduction gap ( afm configuration ) are systematically larger than in the ae calculations .",
    "this allowed us to discard ar - core cu pps already at this stage of pp validation .",
    "as for the spin superexchange coupling constant @xmath1 , quantum espresso with the hard ne - core cu pp gives 0.64  ev in lda , while wien2k gives 0.72  ev . in lda+u , the wien2k @xmath1 is rapidly decreasing as @xmath35 . in pp dft",
    ", we find only a weak dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "this may be a peculiarity of the implementation of the lda+u scheme within the plane - wave basis method of quantum espresso .",
    "[ [ fp - dmc - atom - ionization - energies - and - rejection - of - mg - core - cu - pseudopotentials ] ] fp - dmc atom ionization energies and rejection of mg - core cu pseudopotentials ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    as we have pointed out , in dft calculations for bulk ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , the ne - core and the mg - core cu pps appear to be equally good , provided proper optimization has been carried out .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that they will perform well in diffusion monte carlo calculations . in order to test the latter , we calculated the cu atom ionization energy with fp - dmc , using lda for generating trial wave functions .",
    "the fp - dmc computational parameters are the following : @xmath36  ha@xmath19 for the imaginary time step and 4000 for the number of dmc walkers . with the hard ne - core and with the mg - core cu pps , we obtain , respectively , 7.724(37 )  ev and 8.302(36 )  ev for the cu atom ionization energy .",
    "the former number is in a much better agreement with the experimental result of 7.72638(1 )  ev .",
    "one of the reasons of the poor performance of the mg - core pp in this test , is that the @xmath37 orbital , which is treated as core here , has a significant overlap in space with the @xmath38 orbital , treated as valence [ see fig .",
    "[ f.ne_hardsoft ]  ( c ) ] .",
    "this causes less trouble in dft which is formulated in terms of kohn - sham orbitals so that such a division based on orbital character is natural .",
    "dmc , on the other hand , operates with a full many - electron wave function where a removal of the @xmath37 electrons negatively affects the representation of the motion of the nearby @xmath38 electrons .",
    "this issue has also been discussed in the context of gw @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that using a mg - core cu pp instead of a ne - core one in bulk ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3 fp - dmc calculations could provide a speedup of more than 30% , owing to the fact that the deeply lying @xmath37 electrons are a significant source of the energy variance .",
    "[ [ equation - of - state - of - cuo - dimer - and - hard - vs .- soft - ne - core - cu - pseudopotentials ] ] equation of state of cuo dimer and hard vs. soft ne - core cu pseudopotentials ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    although the hard ne - core pp has been proven to be of a good quality for both dft and dmc , it has a disadvantage in terms of computational load and memory demands as it requires a minimum of 500  ry energy cut - off for the quantum espresso plane - wave basis .",
    "this results from the quite small cut - off radii of the @xmath39- , @xmath40- , and @xmath0-channels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.ne_hardsoft ]  ( a ) . in view of this",
    ", we constructed and tested an alternative ne - core cu pp with a soft core and low energy cut - off requirements of less that 200  ry [ fig .",
    "[ f.ne_hardsoft ]  ( b ) ] .",
    "it demonstrated excellent characteristics in dft tests but , unfortunately , gives worse results in dmc than the hard - core cu pp .",
    "in particular , with the soft - core pp the equilibrium interatomic separation distance in a cuo molecule is overestimated by more than 3% in fp - dmc [ holds for lda , lda+u ( @xmath8=3.5 , 6  ev ) , and b3lyp wave functions ] , whereas with the hard - core pp it is overestimated by only 0.6% ( fig .",
    "[ f.cuo_eos ] ) . also the cu atom ionization energy is slightly underestimated : 7.548(42 )  ev .",
    "thus all calculations in dmc reported in the paper were obtained with the hard ne - core pseudopotential .",
    "the surprising sensitivities to pseudopotential formulation that we find even for small core pseudopotentials indicates that careful testing is essential and results from large core pseudopotentials must be treated with caution .",
