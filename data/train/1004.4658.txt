    "spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a key role in our current understanding of particle physics and is expected to have been a major factor in determining the physical properties of the early universe @xcite . in cosmology ,",
    "two aspects of symmetry breaking are of great interest : it typically happens far from thermal equilibrium and it is inherently nonlinear . in the context of the electroweak phase transition , for example ,",
    "an initially thermalized state is tossed out of equilibrium as the higgs evolves to acquire a nonzero expectation value . in inflation , a nonthermal state thermalizes to reheat the universe with an explosive energy transfer from the inflaton to other field modes .",
    "it is thus of great interest to study the dynamics of symmetry breaking in an expanding background numerically in order to isolate key features that may escape analytical techniques .    here ,",
    "we report results on 3d simulations for two situations : a single , self - interacting scalar field with a double - well potential , and an su(2 ) non - abelian higgs model . in refs .",
    "@xcite results have been obtained for the case of a single scalar in 1d .",
    "it was shown that long - lived , time - dependent field configurations known as oscillons @xcite emerged spontaneously and contributed an amazing 50% of the total energy density .",
    "these initial results triggered the present study in the context of more realistic models .",
    "there are two broad classes of scalar field oscillons that have been studied in the literature , small and large - amplitude .",
    "small - amplitude oscillons do not probe the highly nonlinear domain of the potential , and typically have large spatial widths @xcite .",
    "their small amplitude makes it possible to study them using linearization techniques .",
    "large - amplitude oscillons are harder to investigate analytically @xcite .",
    "simulations of scalar models in static 2d and 3d backgrounds @xcite and expanding 1d backgrounds @xcite indicate that mostly large - amplitude oscillons are excited during symmetry breaking .",
    "as we show next , this is also the case for an expanding 3d spacetime .",
    "the situation is different for su(2 ) models , as we explain below .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we introduce the scalar field model in an expanding universe and discuss its lattice implementation .",
    "we report our results for a double well potential , showing that oscillons contribute about 1.2% of the energy density . in section iii",
    "we show that , contrary to naive expectation , for certain values of the expansion rate oscillons may have their lifetimes enhanced .",
    "we explain this result analytically by making use of parametric resonance . in section",
    "iv we introduce the su(2 ) non - abelian higgs model and discuss its lattice implementation in an expanding universe . in section v we discuss the results for this model .",
    "in particular , we show that , as in the case of a real scalar field , oscillons contribute a nontrivial percentage of the total energy density .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that the cosmological expansion seems to favor the formation of oscillons for a wider range of parameters as compared to the static case , where oscillons were found only in a 2:1 mass ratio for the higgs and gauge boson . in section",
    "vi , we briefly discuss possible application of oscillons in cosmology , which we hope to explore in forthcoming work , and conclude with a summary of our results .",

    "thus , before we start , it may be useful to summarize what is known of oscillon lifetimes in these models .    as we mentioned before , for real scalar fields in 3d , the oscillon lifetime  with or without the enhancement from the expansion reported here ",
    "is typically @xmath207 @xcite . for models with gauge fields , the evidence at hand points to _ very _ large lifetimes .",

    "those in the gauged - su(2 ) higgs model have not been observed to decay after @xmath210 @xcite .",
    "thus , although a more detailed study of abelian and non - abelian higgs oscillons and their stability is clearly warranted , results so far indicate that they may be extremely long - lived , even perturbatively stable . of course , the key question is whether their lifetime can be longer than the cosmological time scale at their formation .",
    "if that s the case , they behave as stable , localized defects .    at the gut scale , it is clear that the oscillon lifetime is at least of order of the cosmological time scale , @xmath211 .",
    "thus , for all practical purposes at gut scales oscillons behave as stable localized defects . as has been shown elsewhere , in the context of first - order phase transitions , long - lived bubble - like configurations such as oscillons",
    "can either become a critical bubble or coalesce to become one . in both cases ,",
    "the decay of the false vacuum is greatly accelerated , changing from exponentially - suppressed to power - law @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that oscillons may accelerate the decay of the false vacuum during inflation , potentially solving the bubble coalescence problem of old inflation .",
    "this has been recently illustrated within the context of a modified hybrid inflation model @xcite .",
    "oscillons may also have a key impact during post - inflationary reheating .",
    "as coherent field configurations , they naturally delay the approach to equilibrium , acting as bottlenecks for equipartition @xcite .",
    "as such , they may influence ( decrease ) the reheating temperature , a possibility we are currently investigating . an interesting open question is how these nonequilibrium results apply in the context of gauge models .    moving on to the electroweak scale , since @xmath212",
    ", we are on a realm which is very distant from our numerical range of @xmath213 .",
    "still , we suggest that there are at least two ways in which oscillons may play a role at these relatively low energy scales .",
    "both depend on their lifetime .",
    "if non - abelian oscillons live for @xmath214 , that is , if they are perturbatively stable , they will remain active at cosmologically - relevant time scales .",
    "as at the gut scale discussed above , they may speed up vacuum decay in the context of a first - order transition ( which is ruled out in the standard model but not in all of its extensions ) or they may delay thermalization . if they persist for even longer , they may even be relevant to dark matter or baryogenesis .    on the hand ,",
    "if they live for shorter times @xmath215 , their presence may still affect the dynamics of symmetry breaking . as is well - known ,",
    "most phase transitions are initiated due to the presence of inhomogeneities or `` seeds '' @xcite . if oscillons are present in sufficient quantities , they will modify the effective potential nonperturbatively , affecting the dynamics of the transition @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate two situations : a single scalar field with a double - well potential and an su(2 ) non - abelian higgs model . for the single scalar </S>",
    "<S> , we show that large - amplitude oscillon configurations emerge spontaneously and persist to contribute about 1.2% of the energy density of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that for a range of parameters , oscillon lifetimes are _ enhanced _ by the expansion and that this effect is a result of parametric resonance . for the su(2 ) case , we see about @xmath0 of the final energy density in oscillons . </S>"
