    "recently , korutcheva , opper and l@xmath0pez @xcite pointed out that statistical mechanical analysis based on the replica calculation @xcite can be used to investigate some specific statistical properties of optimal solutions for an optimization problem , the so - called knapsack problem .",
    "the knapsack problem they studied is one of the integer programming problems in which the variables are all integer .",
    "the problem is stated as follows .",
    "let us suppose that a man climbs a mountain .",
    "he puts @xmath1 items @xmath2 in his knapsack .",
    "each item has its own weight @xmath3 and `` utility '' @xmath4 which means , for example , its own `` price '' or `` necessity in climbing a mountain '' .",
    "he can not bring all the @xmath1 items in his knapsack and he has to leave some of them .",
    "he must decide which combination of items is best for him .",
    "we can write down the above situation as @xmath5 where the decision variable @xmath6 is defined such that the @xmath7th item goes into the knapsack , and @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "the constant @xmath9 represents the weight limit .",
    "if we have to take account not only of the strength of the man but also of the capacity of the knapsack itself ( i.e. the volume of the knapsack is limited ) , this new constraint must be considered and the problem becomes more complex .",
    "thus it is meaningful for us to generalize our problem to a new form with @xmath10 constraints as follows .",
    "+ @xmath11 following korutcheva @xcite , we set the utilities @xmath12 all @xmath13 , and we set the limits @xmath14 all representing capacities of the man , of his knapsack , etc , to @xmath9 .    in order to treat the multi - constraint ( @xmath15 ) knapsack problem in a more familiar way for physicists ,",
    "we convert the decision variables @xmath16 into spin variables @xmath17 , by transformation @xmath18 .",
    "the load @xmath19 is also transformed as @xmath20 , where the quenched random variable @xmath21 has zero mean and variance @xmath22 and is assumed to obey the distribution @xmath23 as loads @xmath24 , which means ",
    "weights \" for example , should be positive , we must choose the above variance @xmath22 small enough and for this small variance , the fraction of items for which @xmath25 for all @xmath26 vanishes exponentially with increasing @xmath10 . in this paper , we use @xmath27 following korutcheva _ et.al _",
    "@xcite . using these transformations , our problem is rewritten as follows .",
    "+ @xmath28 where @xmath29 from the constraints appearing in eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) , if we treat the case of @xmath30 , we can put most of the items into the knapsack . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of items to be in the knapsack is too small when we set @xmath31 .",
    "for this reason , we treat the case of @xmath32 which means that about half of the items go into the knapsack .",
    "the case of finite @xmath10 in the limit @xmath1 infinity was investigated by meanti @xcite by the lagrangian relaxation technique .",
    "they gave the explicit results for the special cases of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "recently , fontanari @xcite presented an explicit calculation of the annealed entropy of the configuration @xmath35 which satisfies @xmath10 constraints and gives the total benefit @xmath36 .",
    "he estimated the upper limit of the total benefit using the zero entropy condition .",
    "he compared it with the exact result from lagrangian relaxation for the case of @xmath37 ( exact solutions ) and @xmath38 to conclude that the annealed approximation becomes good as @xmath10 increases .",
    "the original knapsack problem consists of only one constraint , or at most , several constraints .",
    "one may feel that only such a case is worth investigating .",
    "however , in actual operations research field , we sometimes face multi - constraint ( @xmath15 ) knapsack problems @xcite , an example of which is investigated in this paper .",
    "if we look at the above problem from an actual operations research ( or ) point of view , difficulties lie in the discreteness of knapsack variables .",
    "when hardship of this sorts confronts us , it is customary to apply the  linear programing relaxation \" technique @xcite .",
    "linear programing relaxation is an approach to solve the integer programing problem approximately , which brings us to the neighborhood of the exact solution .",
    "actually , for linear programing problems , a lot of useful methods , for example , the simplex method or the interior point method , have been proposed and improved @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is worth while to investigate the objective function for a linear programing problem itself ( not as a relaxation of integer programing problem such as the orignal knapsack problem ) @xcite .",
    "linear programing problem is defined as follows @xmath39 problems of the above style occurs very often in our life . ",
    "the diet ( nutrition ) problem \" is one of them .",
    "the diet problem ask us to determine the intake @xmath40 of each food .",
    "each food @xmath41 has its own nutrients @xmath19 , i.e , calcium , protein , vitamin , energy , etc . ,",
    "and one has to take each nutrient within the limit , i.e @xmath42 @xmath43 , where @xmath19 is @xmath26th nutrient of the @xmath7th food .",
    "we should notice that valuables in this problem are real numbers , not integers .",
    "and linear programing problem has more application than for integer programing problem @xcite . for two reason ,",
    "it is worth investigating the multi - constraint ( @xmath15 ) continuous knapsack problem .",
    "when we look at our knapsack problem from the stand - point of linear programing relaxation , the knapsack valuable @xmath44 , which has a real value and determines whether the @xmath45th item goes into knapsack , takes any value in the real subspace satisfies @xmath46 .",
    "we treat the next real - variable problem in the present paper . @xmath47 and eq.(5 ) .",
    "although this relaxation of constraint @xmath48 and @xmath49 in eq.(7 ) somewhat obscures the direct significance of the variable @xmath50 , the global macroscopic behavior of the system is expected not to be affected by this approximation as was mentioned above . and this constraint could be justified as simply the spherical version of the problem investigated by korutcheva @xcite    using this linear programing relaxation technique , we can obtain the approximate configuration @xmath51 and we get higher value of the objective function ( or the total profit ) @xmath52 in this paper , we investigate the knapsack problem by the linear programing relaxation technique and estimate the objective function when the number of constraints is given for a large problem size .",
    "for the parameter regions mentioned in the previous section , we consider the case with continuous variables under the normalization constraint @xmath53 . for a large problem size , the fractional volume of solution @xmath54 to eq.(7 )",
    "is written by introducing the `` fluctuation of the magnetization '' around @xmath55 , which is of order @xmath56 , @xmath57 as @xmath58 this expression is similar to gardner s volume of a binary spherical perceptron with local field @xmath59 and stability criterion constant @xmath60 appearing in the problem of optimal capacity@xcite @xcite or of the generalization of maximum stability rule @xcite .",
    "thus it is possible to use the same technique . and this @xmath61 is the value of configuration @xmath62 which have a fixed @xmath63 , implying also a fixed utility @xmath64 . the typical value of @xmath61 is given by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 denotes the averaging over quenched disorder .",
    "we perform the average of @xmath67 with the distribution @xmath68 over the different sets of solutions using the replica trick as follows .",
    "+ @xmath69 the averaging of the power @xmath70 is accomplished by introducing an ensemble of @xmath71 identical replicas + @xmath72 then we introduce the order parameter which is the overlap between two solutions labeled by two replica indices @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 by the standard procedure , we obtain within the replica symmetric ansatz @xmath76\\ ] ] where @xmath77 denotes the extremization with respect to the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 @xmath81\\ ] ] @xmath82\\ ] ] using the saddle point equation with respect to @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath83 using this result and saddle point equation with respect to @xmath84 , we get @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 finally we estimate the saddle point of eq.(19 ) with respect to @xmath88 in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "this means that only one optimal solution ( which satisfies all @xmath90 conditions in eq.(7 ) ) is selected for a given number of constraints in this limit and then optimal @xmath91 can be calculated by @xmath89 for this optimal @xmath92 which satisfies all @xmath10 constraints ( 7 ) .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath91 as a function of @xmath93 .",
    "this result is shown in figure @xmath94 .    from this result",
    ", we see that @xmath95 lines show the next behavior : as the number of constraints increases , @xmath63 decreases and as a result , total utilities decrease ( we should remember that total utilities are given as @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) . in figure 2",
    ", we also plotted the optimal profit @xmath91 for the case of ising variables using the zero entropy condition of solution discrete space taken from @xcite .",
    "this result shows that we can obtain the larger optimal profit than that of the original knapsack problem by our relaxation of variables .",
    "in order to investigate the local stability of the rs solution , we follow the usual almeida and thouless @xcite argument and introduce the fluctuations of the order parameters around the rs order parameter as follows . @xmath98",
    "it turns out that only fluctuations in @xmath99 and @xmath100 lead to instability .",
    "the function to be investigated has the form @xmath101 from this expression , we can apply gardner s @xcite@xcite analysis to our case and obtained at - line as    @xmath102^{2 } < 1\\ ] ]    where @xmath103 and @xmath88 is the order parameter obtained by the replica symmetric calculation and is given as @xmath104 we plot this condition eq.(24 ) in figure @xmath94 .    from this figure",
    ", we see that the replica symmetry is stable for @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "however , when @xmath63 becomes smaller than this critical value , the replica symmetry breaking occurs and the replica symmetric saddle point becomes unstable .",
    "the at point ( @xmath107 ) is a critical point where the replica symmetric order parameter @xmath108 splits into ( one step ) replica symmetry breaking saddle point represented by @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "if this rsb transition at @xmath111 is continuous , the at condition eq.(24 ) gives a correct criterion of replica symmetry breaking . on the other hand , if the rsb transition is discontinuous ( first order ) , we should regard this discontinuity point as the symmetry breaking point rather than the at stability limit .",
    "fortunately , as we see in the next section , this transition is continuous and the at argument is correct .    in order to understand this situation physically",
    ", we can investigate the replica symmetry breaking from the dis - connectivity of the solution space @xmath112 according to monasson and okane @xcite , who treated rsb of perceptron with non - monotonic transfer function .",
    "+ the solution condition eq.(7 ) can be rewritten as @xmath113 then if @xmath63 is positive , for many constraints @xmath10 , the space of @xmath112 which satisfies eq.(7 ) as well as the normalization constraint @xmath114 consists of a single domain and the solution space is connected .",
    "on the other hand , as @xmath63 becomes negative , the space of @xmath112 splits into a lot of domains and the solution space is disconnected .",
    "here we can estimate the @xmath56 term roughly appearing on the right hand side of the above inequality as @xmath115 .",
    "we should notice that this term is of @xmath56 and we used the standard deviation @xmath27 .",
    "therefore if we investigate the dis - connectivity of solution space , replica symmetry must be broken for @xmath116 .",
    "this value is not so far from the value obtained by the at argument .",
    "we conclude that this dis - connectivity leads to replica symmetry breaking . for this rsb region",
    ", we will later find the one step replica symmetry breaking solution following the scheme of parisi @xcite      in the previous subsection , we calculated the volume of solution space @xmath117 for quenched random loads @xmath118 . for optimal @xmath91 , this volume shrinks to zero continuously .",
    "thus the increase in the number of constraints leads to a decrease of the solution space @xmath112 in a discrete manner , and the entropy of solution space is @xmath119 at @xmath120 .",
    "following the idea suggested by krauth and m@xmath121zard @xcite we expect that the optimal @xmath63 for continuous variables may be obtained when the volume of solution contains typically a single point of hypercube . from analogy with the discrete - variable problem",
    ", this should occur around + @xmath122      we first calculate the condition eq.(28 ) by the annealed approximation as @xmath123 this condition is easily calculated by @xmath124 @xmath125 finally we get @xmath126 this is shown in figure @xmath127 .",
    "+      next we calculate the above zero entropy condition eq.(28 ) by the quenched calculation defined as @xmath128 this leads to @xmath129 we plotted this result also in figure 2 .    from figure @xmath127",
    "we find that this line eq.(34 ) obtained by the quenched zero entropy condition is stable in the rs region . in figure 4",
    "we plotted the behavior of the order parameter @xmath88 as a function of @xmath130 which gives zero entropy and satisfies eq.(34 ) . from these results",
    ", we may conclude that our zero entropy approach gives a meaningful and consistent criterion for the optimal @xmath91 .      in this subsection",
    ", we calculate the one step replica symmetry breaking solution following parisi @xcite@xcite .",
    "we try to find a first candidate for matrices and @xmath131 appearing in the free energy . using parisi s suggestion",
    ", we divide the @xmath71 replicas into @xmath132 groups of @xmath133 replicas .",
    "next we set @xmath134 , if @xmath130 and @xmath135 belong to the same group , and @xmath136 , if @xmath73 and @xmath74 belong to different groups and we set @xmath137 .",
    "we express and @xmath131 in terms of a tensor product , @xmath138 @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a @xmath26-dimensional unit matrix and @xmath141 . using this form of broken symmetry of replica",
    ", we get the free energy as follows , @xmath142   \\mbox{}+\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{m}){\\log}(1-q_{1 } )   \\mbox{}+\\frac{q_{0}}{2[1-q_{1}+m(q_{1}-q_{0})]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the saddle point equations with respect to @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath84 and @xmath79 .    before calculating the one step rsb solution , we had better investigate whether the one step rsb solution actually exists or not by minimizing the one step rsb free energy @xmath145 with respect to the order parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath133 .",
    "for example , we try to investigate the case of @xmath146 .",
    "varying @xmath73 in the free energy @xmath145 , we look for the set of order parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath133 to minimize @xmath145 . in table 1",
    ", we list the result for the typical value of @xmath130 . from this table",
    ", we see that until @xmath147 , the replica symmetric saddle point ( which is @xmath148 and is independent of @xmath133 ) is stable and the one step rsb solution does not exist . when we exceed the critical value @xmath111 , the replica symmetric saddle point becomes unstable and order parameter @xmath88 splits into one step rsb order parameters @xmath109 and",
    "@xmath109 continuously as shown also in figure 3 . from this continuous transition ,",
    "we conclude that the at argument in the previous section is consistent . comparing the free energy @xmath149 and @xmath145",
    ", we see that the global minimum of this system goes from the rs saddle point @xmath88 to the one step rsb saddle point @xmath150 at the at instability point",
    ". therefore , the one step rsb solution actually exists .    in order to obtain the solution in the limit @xmath151",
    ", we use the scaling @xmath152 and @xmath153 to get @xmath154 here @xmath155+\\frac{1}{2\\mu}{\\log}[1+\\mu(1-q)]+\\frac{q}{2[1+\\mu(1-q)]}\\hspace{.7in}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 and @xmath157 } ) } { \\sqrt{1+\\mu(1-q)}}h\\left(\\frac{{m}/({2\\sigma})-y\\sqrt{1+q } } { \\sqrt{1-q}\\sqrt{1+\\mu(1-q)}}\\right)\\ ] ] the saddle point equations with respect to @xmath158 and @xmath159 @xmath160 give the critical values @xmath161 calculated by the one step rsb scheme .",
    "we solved eq.(42 ) numerically and show the result in figure 2 .    from this figure",
    ", we see that the replica symmetry breaking decreases the optimal @xmath91 slightly .",
    "we also confirm this result from the fact that replica symmetry breaking point @xmath162 comes close to @xmath94 . in figure 5",
    ", we also show the order parameter @xmath163 as a function of the optimal profit @xmath91 . from this figure",
    "we see that , as @xmath91 becomes close to @xmath164 , i.e. as replica symmetry breaking becomes weak , @xmath165 becomes @xmath94 gradually ( @xmath166 for @xmath167 ) .",
    "this result is reasonable from the meaning of replica symmetry breaking .",
    "the reason is that in critical limit of @xmath73 , the one step rsb order parameter @xmath109 and @xmath110 becomes close to @xmath108 and @xmath89 if replica symmetry does not break down .    in order to confirm that this one step rsb solution is exact",
    ", we must check the stability of the one step rsb saddle point by the same technique as that used for the at line and investigate if the free energy of one step calculation is lower than that of the second step calculation . or the distribution of sizes of the `` disconnected '' domains of solution space must be computed analytically by the same technique as in monasson and okane @xcite .",
    "this is a highly non - trivial problem .",
    "however we can conjecture that the two step replica symmetry breaking can hardly decrease the optimal profit even if two step rsb solution exists , because the optimal profit of replica symmetric calculation and that of one step replica symmetry breaking calculation are very close to each other as we saw above .",
    "we have calculated the optimal profit @xmath91 explicitly for the case of continuous knapsack variables and the number of constraints @xmath10 is of the same order with the number of items @xmath1 by replica symmetric calculation explicitly . from the at argument",
    ", the replica symmetric solution becomes unstable for @xmath168 .",
    "we also investigated this symmetry breaking point by minimizing the one step replica symmetry breaking free energy directly and saw that this transition is continuous and the at line is valid . for the argument of the problem of the optimal storage capacity of the perceptron with non - monotonic transfer function investigated by monasson and okane @xcite ,",
    "the physical meaning of this rsb can be understood as the dis - connectivity of the solution space .",
    "therefore , from the condition of dis - connectivity of solution space , we roughly estimated where replica symmetry breaking begins .",
    "for the rsb region , it was necessary to try to find a replica symmetry breaking solution according to parisi s procedure @xcite @xcite . thus using parisi s scheme",
    ", we obtained the one step rsb solution and the result shows that replica symmetry breaking makes the @xmath91 decrease slightly . because it is not easy to confirm that this one step rsb calculation is exact , we can roughly expect that even if we calculate the two step rsb solution or three step rsb solution or further step rsb solution , the optimal profit obtained at these further rsb saddle point should hardly increase . in stead of investigation in this direction , in the replica symmetric region",
    ", we can find a consistent solution using the zero entropy approach and this result agrees with the discrete variables case @xcite for the most part .",
    "this result may also support the validity of their rs calculation .",
    "the present statistical mechanical approach is expected to be applicable the other linear programming problems .",
