    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe , established from cosmological and astrophysical observations , remains an unsolved puzzle . despite the precision with which the dm abundance is known  @xcite ,",
    "we have still limited information on its properties and its nature .",
    "various heavy candidates have been proposed , from neutralinos , sneutrinos and gravitinos in supersymmetry , to stable scalars in little higgs models , to kaluza - klein modes in extra - dimensions and superheavy candidates ( for a review see , e.g. ref .",
    "light particles have also been studied as possible dm constituents : axions  @xcite , sterile neutrinos with masses in the kev range  @xcite and light scalars with mev ",
    "gev masses  @xcite .    here",
    ", we focus on light particles as dm candidates : they can evade the lee - weinberg limit  @xcite and successfully explain the observed amount of dm in the universe .",
    "they can be coupled to heavy fermions  @xcite or to new light gauge bosons  @xcite . for masses below 100  mev , the only standard model ( sm ) channels of annihilation allowed are into electron - positron pairs , photons and neutrino - antineutrino pairs .",
    "interestingly , if mev dm annihilates into sm particles other than neutrinos , it could make an important contribution to the reionization of the universe , as well as significantly raise the gas temperature prior to the reionization epoch , leaving a potentially detectable imprint on the cosmological 21-cm signal  @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for different results )",
    ". however , the couplings to electrons are strongly constrained by observations of gamma rays .",
    "in particular , the dm self - annihilations into electron - positron pairs is one of the candidate explanations  @xcite for the 511  kev emission line detected by integral / spi from the bulge of our galaxy  @xcite . nevertheless , the required cross section ( times the relative velocity ) is , by about four orders of magnitude , smaller than the one necessary to explain the observed abundance of dm in the universe , @xmath1 . only velocity - dependent cross sections would be able to accommodate both evidences , but provide a bad fit to the integral / spi data for masses below @xmath0100  mev  @xcite .",
    "in addition , higher order processes would lead to gamma ray production via internal bremsstrahlung  @xcite and positron annihilations in flight with the electrons in the interstellar medium  @xcite .",
    "the comptel and egret data constrain either the cross section to be smaller than what is required to explain the 511  kev line or the dm mass to be smaller than a few mev . similarly , the annihilation into photons can be constrained even stronger than the electron - positron channel by searches of diffuse gamma rays .",
    "thus , the self - annihilation cross section into electron - positron pairs or photons , either was subdominant at dm freeze - out in the early universe or , if velocity - dependent , at present it is much smaller than it was at dm freeze - out and can not be tested today in a model independent way .",
    "it is natural to assume that these light dm particles couple to neutrinos as well , unless special models are invoked . while the couplings with charged leptons and photons are severely bounded as discussed above ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the interactions with neutrinos are very poorly constrained and can be even stronger than weak interactions .",
    "even more , the self - annihilation into neutrinos , @xmath2 , is the only channel into sm particles , whose velocity - independent cross section can be as large as required to reproduce the observed dm abundance !",
    "therefore , the analysis of constraints on the @xmath2 cross section might constitute a direct test of dm freeze - out , for dm with masses in the mev range .",
    "interestingly , it was recently noted  @xcite that , for mev range dm , the value of the annihilation cross section necessary to reproduce the observed dm abundance may induce neutrino masses in the experimentally constrained range of values via one - loop contributions .",
    "in addition , mev dm could also have implications for observations of small scale structure  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has also been noticed that dm could couple to neutrinos strongly enough to produce observable effects that can be constrained by cosmic microwave background  @xcite and large - scale structure formation observations  @xcite .",
    "however , in this case , only if an asymmetry between dm particle and antiparticle is produced at some early epoch in the evolution of the universe , the dm density could be the required one today .",
    "these models of light dm can be tested indirectly by the detection of sm particles ( electrons , photons and neutrinos ) emitted in dm self - annihilations in galaxies , in particular the milky way . here , we will assume the branching ratio into neutrinos to be dominant in dm self - annihilations .",
    "since neutrinos are the least detectable particles in the sm , a limit on their flux would conservatively set an upper bound on the total annihilation cross section .",
    "the same approach , but for higher masses , was followed in refs .",
    "we evaluate the expected signal from dm annihilations in the entire milky way in large neutrino detectors with low energy threshold , such as the existing super - kamiokande ( sk ) and the proposed liquid scintillator detector lena  @xcite . by using sk data we are able to set a very stringent upper bound on the total annihilation cross section in the mass interval @xmath015 - 130  mev .",
    "in addition , for velocity - independent cross sections and dm masses below @xmath0130  mev , this analysis constrains the only sm channel which could have been relevant at dm freeze - out in the early universe .",
    "finally , we also study the possibilities to detect a positive signal from mev dm in future detectors like the proposed lena detector .    in sec .",

    "stable particles with masses in the mev range constitute a cold dm candidate .",
    "detailed structure formation simulations show that cold dm clusters hierarchically in halos and the formation of large scale structure in the universe can be successfully reproduced . in the case of spherically symmetric matter density with isotropic velocity dispersion ,",
    "the simulated dm profile in the galaxies can be parametrized via @xmath3^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha } ,    \\label{rhopar}\\ ] ] where @xmath4  kpc is the solar radius circle , @xmath5 is the dm density at @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the scale radius , @xmath8 is the inner cusp index , @xmath9 is the slope as @xmath10 and @xmath11 determines the exact shape of the profile in regions around @xmath7 . commonly used profiles  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) can differ considerably in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "however , this has only a relatively mild effect on the neutrino flux if a large field of view is considered  @xcite .    assuming dm annihilates into neutrino - antineutrino pairs",
    ", we can compute the neutrino flux coming from these annihilations in the halo ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as we will see below , for energies below @xmath0 100  mev , information on the direction of the incoming neutrino",
    "is very poor if the detection is via interactions with nucleons .",
    "as this is the case presented here , we will be interested in considering the flux coming from all directions , so we shall take the flux averaged over the entire galaxy .",
    "this also helps in maximizing the observed neutrino flux while minimizing the impact of the choice of dm profile  @xcite .    the angular - averaged intensity over the whole milky way , i.e. the average number flux , is given by the angular - averaged line of sight integration of the dm density square , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 0.3  gev  @xmath15 is a normalizing dm density , which is equal to the commonly quoted dm density at @xmath6 , and the upper limit of integration is @xmath16 , and depends on the size of the halo @xmath17 .",
    "as the contribution at large scales is negligible , different choices of @xmath17 do not affect @xmath18 in a significant way , as long as it is a factor of a few larger than the scale radius , @xmath7 .",
    "the differential neutrino and antineutrino flux per flavor from dm annihilations is then given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the dm particle and @xmath21 is the averaged self - annihilation cross section ( times the relative velocity of the annihilating particles ) .",
    "the factor 1/2 accounts for dm being its own antiparticle , and the factor of 1/3 comes from the assumption that the branching ratio of annihilation is the same in the three neutrino flavors . in case of annihilation predominantly in one flavor , averaged oscillations between the production point and the detector would generate the other flavors with comparable intensity .",
    "in particular , given the present oscillation parameters  @xcite , for pure @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels , the final flavor ratios would be @xmath24 1 : 2 : 2 , whereas for a pure @xmath25 flux we would have @xmath24 3 : 1 : 1 .",
    "hence , thanks to neutrino oscillations , there is a guaranteed flux of neutrinos in all flavors .",
    "however , for simplicity herein we will consider equal annihilation into all flavors .",
    "let us note that while dm profiles tend to agree at large scales , uncertainties are still present for the inner region of the galaxy . as the neutrino flux from dm annihilations scales as @xmath26 , this leads to an uncertainty in the overall normalization of the flux . to understand this effect quantitatively ,",
    "we have studied the impact of the chosen halo profile by choosing three spherically symmetric profiles with isotropic velocity dispersion which , from more to less cuspy , are : moore , quinn , governato , stadel and lake ( mqgsl )  @xcite , navarro , frenk and white ( nfw )  @xcite and kravstov , klypin , bullock and primack ( kkbp )  @xcite . for each of the three profiles",
    "there is a range of values for the dm density at the solar circle , @xmath27 , which satisfy the present constraints from the allowed range for the local rotational velocity  @xcite , the amount of flatness of the rotational curve of the milky way and the maximal amount of its non - halo components  @xcite .",
    "we compile in table  [ table ] the values of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ rhopar ] ) , the limiting values for @xmath5  @xcite , along with the corresponding limiting values of @xmath28 for each of the three profiles .",
    "note also that , by choosing the same @xmath29 for all profiles , all the uncertainties in the neutrino flux from dm annihilations , coming from the lack of knowledge of the halo profile , lie in @xmath28 .",
    "finally , let us mention that the diffuse signal from cosmic annihilations from all halos could in principle also be used to constrain the total dm annihilation cross section in the mass range considered here .",
    "however , the formation history of halos , although with a fairly universal dependence on the redshift , has a normalization which is quite uncertain and varies by several orders of magnitude for different halo profiles  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties of the cosmic signal induced by those in the halo profiles , other important factors as the clustering of halos , the halo mass function and the lower mass cutoff , are not completely well known and introduce further uncertainties in the cosmic signal .",
    "therefore , the cosmic signal , being much more uncertain than that from the whole milky way , is less suitable to obtain reliable bounds on the total dm annihilation cross section .",
    "in addition , the cosmic signal is likely to be smaller than , or at most of the same order of , the galactic one  @xcite .",
    "hence , and although the diffuse ( redshifted ) cosmic signal would allow to obtain bounds on the total dm annihilation cross section for higher masses than the galactic signal studied here , we will not consider it further .",

    "neutrino interactions with free protons are also stronger than interactions with bound nucleons up to energies of about @xmath080  mev . however , the latter interactions give non - negligible contributions and should be taken into account . thus , in the following , we focus on @xmath45 from dm annihilations and on neutrino interactions on both free and bound nucleons .",
    "however , for detectors with very low energy threshold like scintillator detectors , the inverse beta - decay reaction can be clearly tagged by the signal in coincidence of the positron annihilation followed by a delayed 2.2  mev photon , which is emitted when the neutron is captured by a free proton . in water - erenkov detectors like sk ,",
    "the threshold is above 2.2  mev , so this reaction can not be discriminated from neutrino interactions with nuclei .",

    "any other possible decay mode would produce gamma rays , which are much easier to detect , and would allow to set a much stronger ( and model - dependent ) bound on the total annihilation cross section .",

    ", it has been shown that a stringent upper limit on the total dm annihilation cross section can be obtained for masses above @xmath0100  mev by comparing the expected time - integrated annihilation signal of all galactic halos ( cosmic signal )  @xcite and the signal from annihilations in the milky way halo  @xcite with the dominant background at these energies : the flux of atmospheric neutrinos .    in this paper , we consider the low mass region below @xmath0130  mev , for which the best present data comes from the sk detector  @xcite : a search for the dsnb was performed by looking for positrons in the energy range 18  mev82  mev , produced by @xmath45 interactions .",

    "the dominant interaction of @xmath45 is through the inverse beta - decay reaction , @xmath67 .",
    "however , the interactions of neutrinos with oxygen nuclei need also to be taken into account .",
    "we have included in our analysis both the interactions of antineutrinos with free protons and the interactions of neutrinos and antineutrinos with bound nucleons , by considering , in the latter case , a relativistic fermi gas model  @xcite with a fermi surface momentum of 225  mev and a binding energy of 27  mev .    at very low energies",

    "the lena detector is foreseen to have a fiducial volume of 50  @xmath115 m@xmath116 of liquid scintillator and , at the moment , one of the preferred detector sites is a mine in pyhsalmi ( finland ) ( another option is underwater in the mediterranean sea next to pylos , greece )  @xcite . as mentioned above , the inverse beta - decay reaction has a very clear signature in this type of detector , with the positron annihilation followed by a 2.2  mev photon , released when the neutron is captured by a free proton in the scintillator @xmath0180 @xmath117s after the interaction takes place . in this type of detector",

    "in addition , muon - induced spallation products can be efficiently removed , as well as the background of fast neutrons generated by muons passing the surrounding rock  @xcite .",
    "hence , the only relevant backgrounds for the signal studied here come from reactor , atmospheric and diffuse supernova @xmath45 interacting with free protons in the detector .",
    "the latter , albeit not yet measured , constitutes a potential background for the signal of mev dm annihilation into neutrino - antineutrino pairs , but with a very different spectrum .",
    "below @xmath010  mev the flux of @xmath45 from nuclear reactors is the dominant one in lena , and we use the reactor @xmath45 spectrum calculated in ref .  @xcite . in the energy interval between @xmath010  mev and @xmath030  mev ,",

    "( [ snspec ] ) , we obtain the expected dsnb flux at the earth .",
    "note that the neutrino spectrum we have considered has a relatively large average energy for each flavor ( still consistent with star formation history measurements  @xcite ) , which gives rise to a larger flux than in other simulations  @xcite at the energies where the dsnb spectrum may dominate over other backgrounds ( @xmath143  mev ) .",
    "this is a conservative assumption for our purposes , for this flux represents a background for a potential signal from dm annihilation into neutrino - antineutrino pairs . above @xmath030  mev",
    ", it is the atmospheric @xmath45 flux which gives the main contribution to the background in a detector like lena .",

    "[ lena10years ] , we show the expected signal in the lena detector , if located in pyhsalmi ( finland ) , along with the expected backgrounds , after 10 years . we have considered a scintillator mixture in weight of 20% pxe ( c@xmath145h@xmath146 ) and 80% dodecane ( c@xmath147h@xmath148 ) and a fiducial volume of 50@xmath149 m@xmath116 , which amounts to 3.3 @xmath150 free protons .",

    "[ lena10years ] , the energy of the initial neutrino can not be uniquely reconstructed from the measured positron energy . therefore , the signal for @xmath154  mev is not characterized by a delta - function in energy and has a spread over an interval of @xmath0  10  mev . in this case",
    ", the separation of the signal from the background will be more difficult , although still possible .",
    "in the present article we have considered the indirect bounds from the annihilation into neutrino - antineutrino pairs of dm particles with masses in the range of tens of mev .",
    "these particles have been proposed as possible dm candidates and have been advocated in different contexts to explain the 511  kev emission line from the bulge as well as the observed values of neutrino masses .",
    "dm light particles would self - annihilate in the galaxy producing a sizable flux of neutrinos of energy @xmath38 .",
    "these neutrinos might be detected in present and future neutrino experiments .",
    "we have shown that the present data from the sk experiment in the 18  mev82  mev energy region can constrain significantly the total dm annihilation cross section to be smaller than @xmath155@xmath156 , depending on the specific choice of the halo profile , for dm masses between @xmath0 15 - 100  mev .",
    "we have also shown that future large neutrino detectors with sufficient energy resolution and good background discrimination could have the capability to observe a signal if these mev particles exist and the annihilation cross section is the one required to reproduce the observed amount of dm . in particular , the lena detector would have the capability to find a positive signal in a large part of the mass window under interest .",
    "a megaton - size water - erenkov detector , possibly doped with gdcl@xmath46 , and large liquid argon detectors with very good energy resolution at mev energies , would have similar sensitivities .",
    "a negative signal in future large neutrino experiments would either indicate that , if mev dm exists , the annihilation cross section at freeze - out was velocity - dependent or exclude dm masses in the @xmath0  10100  mev .",
    "a positive signal would imply that dm is constituted by particles with masses in the tens of mev range , would measure its mass and would determine , albeit halo profile uncertainties , the cross section which was relevant at dm freeze - out in the early universe .",
