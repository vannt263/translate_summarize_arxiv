    "millisecond pulsars are thought to be uninteresting as targets for gamma - ray experiments .",
    "this opinion partly draws from an argument that typical values of @xmath8 ( or rather their dipolar components ) inferred from @xmath9 and @xmath10 are in the range of @xmath11 to @xmath12 , in contrast with the range of @xmath13 to @xmath14 for classical pulsars .",
    "if gamma - ray radiation is to be a manifestation of magnetospheric activity , it seems quite natural to think of millisecond pulsars in terms of @xmath8 as of a scaled - down version of classical pulsars , which by themselves are weak gamma - ray sources ; only seven of them have been firmly detected so far @xcite .",
    "unsuccesful observational campaigns in the past , mainly by instruments e.g. - @xcite , confirmed this line of thinking .",
    "j0437 - 4715 , with one of the highest spin - down fluxes among all pulsars , thus a very promising target , was nt even included in the priority list .",
    "however , the ` scaling - down ' argument becomes unjustified by the results of x - ray observations . within a sample of some 30 pulsars detected with and other satellites there are 9 millisecond objects with apparent x - ray properties similar to classical pulsars .",
    "in particular , the millisecond pulsars obey the same astonishing relation of becker  &  trmper between the spin - down luminosity   and the soft x - ray luminosity   that classical pulsars do . in most cases",
    "the x - ray spectra are presumed to be non - thermal in character , but whether they represent low - energy tails of putative gamma - ray emission is not known .",
    "rather few papers have been dedicated to the question of gamma - rays in the context of millisecond pulsars on theoretical side .",
    "wei et  al . presented broad - band spectra of both pulsed and unpulsed emission expected in their version of outer - gap model .",
    "sturner & dermer offered predictions for gamma - ray luminosity   in some popular models , but that had been done just by scaling - down the values of @xmath8 in simple analytical formulae for   derived for classical pulsars . in the framework of polar - cap scenarios , rudak & dyks proposed a modification of the model by daugherty & harding .",
    "this modification incorporates a contribution of electron - positron pairs to , which becomes a non - monotonic function of @xmath8 ( see figures 7 and 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "one of the consequences of this modification is that expected values of   for millisecond pulsars , including j0437 - 4715 , are typically about one or two orders of magnitude lower than for classical pulsars .",
    "quantitatively similar estimate , though for different reason , comes from a model of dermer & sturner .",
    "however , if the estimates above are correct then some millisecond pulsars , including j0437 - 4715 , should be detected with next - generation experiments , providing thus a testing ground for magnetospheric models relevant for millisecond pulsars .",
    "the successor of   - - with a possible launch in the year 2005 , is expected to have sensitivity above @xmath2 about 30 times higher then , and it will reach high - energy limit at @xmath15 - closing thus for the first time the energy gap between the vhe ( very high energy ) domain accessible with ground - based cherenkov techniques and the he ( high energy ) domain of satellite experiments @xcite . moreover , since we expect the millisecond pulsars to radiate the electromagnetic energy mostly in the range between @xmath3 and @xmath16 , this class of objects should be of interest for the upcoming iac telescope _ _ @xcite .    our aim is to present major spectral features in the energy range above @xmath17 of pulsed gamma - ray emission which arises due to both ultrarelativistic primary particles ( electrons ) and cascades of secondary particles above polar caps of millisecond pulsars with dipolar magnetic fields of @xmath1 . in particular , we allow for different structures of the accelerating potential , and we show how this affects the slope of the predicted energy spectrum in the range of @xmath2 to @xmath16 . also , compton upscattering of ambient x - ray photons off ultrarelativistic electrons is taken into account . in section 2",
    "we present details of modelling the processes responsible for the formation of gamma - rays in millisecond pulsars .",
    "section 3 describes spectral properties of two distinct components , due to curvature radiation ( cr ) and compton scattering ( ics ) .",
    "conclusions with a discussion of j0437 - 4715 come in section 4 .",
    "= .45 = .45",
    "we use a polar cap model , with most ingredients as postulated by daugherty & harding ( 1982 ) in context of classical pulsars .",
    "high - energy emission is a superposition of curvature radiation ( cr ) of ultrarelativistic primary electrons , and synchrotron radiation ( sr ) of secondary particles ( e@xmath18 pairs ) created via magnetic absorption of photons .",
    "additional features include : 1 ) two models of electron acceleration , 2 ) inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of thermal x - ray photons on electrons .",
    "the first feature is important for the history of cooling of primary electrons and consequently it affects the slope of gamma - ray spectrum above @xmath2 .",
    "the second one ( ics ) is not important for overall cooling of electrons , but the resulting tev component in the gamma - ray spectra is of potential interest . a field of ambient photons necessary for the ics is likely to be present within the magnetosphere of some millisecond pulsars , according to some interpretations of available x - ray and euv observations ( e.g. zavlin & pavlov 1998 , edelstein et al .",
    "we list the details of the model in the following subsections .",
    "we assume that the geometry of the magnetic field of a neutron star is well described by a static , axisymmetric dipole . in polar",
    "coordinates its field lines satisfy @xmath19 where the dipole constant @xmath20 defines a set of field lines which differ by azimuthal angle only .",
    "polar caps are defined as ( two ) regions on the neutron star surface crossed by all lines for which the condition @xmath21 is satisfied , where @xmath22 is a light - cylinder radius for a spin period @xmath9 .",
    "the polar cap radius is then @xmath23 . where @xmath24 is the radius of the neutron star for which we assume the canonical value of @xmath25 cm .",
    "beam particles ( primary electrons ) are ejected from the outer rim of the polar cap and move along the magnetic field lines .    when modelling an extended source of soft photons , which are to be targets for electrons in compton scatterings , we consider two cases of its geometry . in the first case ,",
    "the soft photons come from the hot polar cap with a uniform temperature @xmath26 . in the second case",
    "the soft photons come from the entire surface of the neutron star , however now the temperature is lower : @xmath27 .",
    "primary electrons are injected along magnetic field lines into the magnetosphere from the outer rim of the polar cap .",
    "the structure of longitudinal electric field responsible for their acceleration remains unknown .",
    "however , the electric field must be strong enough to ensure electron positron pair creation .",
    "the presence of pairs is a necessery condition for a magnetized neutron star to be a radio pulsar .",
    "thus the requirement of creating pairs in the magnetosphere is the primary condition that the model has to satisfy .",
    "we use two simple models for particle acceleration .",
    "the first one ( denoted model a ) assumes instant acceleration to ultrarelativistic energy @xmath28 at the moment of electron injection on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the values of @xmath28 are set to be just above the threshold value for creation of secondary pairs @xmath29 which in turn is a function of magnetic field strength at the polar cap @xmath30 and the spin period @xmath9 ( for details see rudak & dyks 1998 , and dyks 1998 ) . for a pulsar with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",
    "the initial energy is @xmath33 . for j0437 - 4715",
    "we took @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , where we used the magnetic field derived from @xmath10 kinematically corrected by camilo et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) .    for comparison",
    "we consider another model ( model b ) of particle acceleration , in which the longitudinal electric field @xmath36 is set at a constant level with an exponential cutoff : @xmath37 where the characteristic scale - height of the electric field is assumed to be equal to the radius of the polar cap @xmath38 . for a pulsar with @xmath31 and @xmath32 the value of @xmath36 at the polar cap surface",
    "was set at the level of @xmath39v  @xmath40 to ensure a total yield of secondary pairs per primary electron similar to that in model ( a ) .",
    "the initial value of the electron energy @xmath41 was assumed .",
    "as electrons accelerate they move along the magnetic field lines and are slowed down by the curvature radiation reaction .",
    "we calculate the electron energy budget as a function of the distance travelled in the magnetopshere .",
    "only a small fraction ( less than one percent , see figure  [ fig1 ] ) of the electrons will scatter on thermal photons originating on the polar cap or on the stellar surface .",
    "thus scattering is not an important electron deceleration process .",
    "=    = .45 = .45 = .45 = .45      we follow the model described by rudak & dyks who calculated broad band energy spectra of high - energy emission for two distinct pulsar groups : low - magnetic field pulsars ( ` millisecond pulsars ' ) and classical pulsars .",
    "the dominant cooling process for primary electrons is the curvature radiation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the electron lorentz factor , @xmath44 is the curvature radius , and @xmath45 is the electron radius .",
    "when considering secondary electrons ( pairs ) one has to consider also the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the rate of sr cooling is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the pitch angle of the pairs .",
    "the photon spectra due to curvature and synchrotron processes are calculated following daugherty & harding .",
    "a detailed dicussion of the role of these processes in the formation of gamma - ray spectra of pulsars is given in rudak & dyks .",
    "our numerical treatment of scattering process follows daugherty & harding ( 1989 ) . as the electrons travel up in the magnetosphere they may scatter off thermal photons originating from the stellar surface or the polar cap . for millisecond pulsars the magnetic field at the surface",
    "is typically @xmath12 or less , i.e. much weaker then the critical field @xmath48 .",
    "thus the scattering process will be well described by the klein - nishina relativistic nonmagnetic cross section :    @xmath49 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where : @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the electron four - momentum , and @xmath52 is the photon four - wave vector .",
    "the scattering rate ( in the  lab frame \" @xmath53 ) by an electron travelling with velocity @xmath54 in a photon field is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the solid angle subtended by the source of soft photons , @xmath57 is the total cross section , @xmath58 is the photon occupation density , and @xmath59 is the unit vector ( @xmath60 ) representing the direction of the incoming soft photon . taking the planck function for @xmath61 this equation reads : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the photon energy in the units of electron mass , @xmath64 is the photon temperature in the units of electron mass .",
    "we draw the energy and direction of the incoming photon from the distribution of @xmath61 , and @xmath56 , respectively ( as used in eq.6 )",
    ". then we transfer them to the electron instantaneous rest frame @xmath65 and there we find the photon scattering angle @xmath66 using the klein - nishina differential cross section @xmath67 ^ 2}\\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times{\\left\\ { 1 + { x^2(1-\\mu)^2\\over   4(1+\\mu^2)\\left[1+{x\\over 2}(1-\\mu)\\right ]   } \\right\\}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the cosine of @xmath66 .",
    "the energy @xmath69 of the scattered photon in @xmath65 is obtained from the compton formula @xmath70 finally , the energy of the outgoing photon is transformed back to @xmath53 .    at each step , as the location of the electron changes , the solid angle @xmath56 is corrected for the finite size of the source of soft photons ( the polar cap or the stellar surface ) .",
    "thus , we take into account the effect of the decreasing photon number density with height ( geometrical dilution ) and then we calculate the scattering rate @xmath71 at a given height above the neutron star surface .      despite low magnetic field values , two conditions for the process of pair creation via magnetic photon absorption ( @xmath72 ) - the energy threshold condition , and the high optical thickness @xmath73 of the magnetosphere -",
    "may well be met in the context of millisecond pulsars .",
    "for instance , in the model spectra calculated numerically by rudak & dyks ( 1999 ) photons with the energy @xmath74 or higher were subject to the magnetic - absorption reprocessing .    in our simulations we use the absorption coefficient as described by erber ( 1966 )",
    ": @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a fine structure constant , @xmath77 is a compton wavelength , @xmath78 is the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the photon momentum , and @xmath79 is the erber parameter @xmath80 .",
    "for the function @xmath81 we use its approximation @xmath82 , valid for @xmath83 ( for @xmath84 this approximation starts to overestimate @xmath85 ) .",
    "the function @xmath86 is the near - threshold correction introduced by @xcite . in the case of millisecond pulsars equation  ( [ eta ] )",
    "is a good approximation even with @xmath87 , since magnetic photon absorption occurs well above the threshold .",
    "electron - positron pairs created through the magnetic absorption radiate then via the synchrotron process .    for demonstrative purposes",
    "it is useful to present the condition @xmath88 in an analytical way .",
    "it is straightforward to show that a photon created with a momentum parallel to the local magnetic field line at a height @xmath89 above the neutron star surface will undergo magnetic absorption if its energy satisfies approximately the following inequality : @xmath90 this formula is valid for dipolar magnetic field , and the field line is attached to the outer rim of the polar cap , and it is in very good agreement with numerical calculations of magnetic photon absorption .",
    "= .45 = .45 = .45 = .45",
    "electrons are either accelerated instantly ( model a ) or accelerated by the electric field given by equation  [ efield ] ( model b ) , and decelerated mainly by the curvature radiation . in model b the deceleration rate is insignificant near the polar cap because it increases with the electron energy and @xmath91 is small .",
    "on the other hand , the acceleration rate does not depend on the electron energy and it ceases at the height @xmath92 ( eq.[efield ] ) .",
    "there exists a region in between where both competing processes balance .",
    "an example calculation of the electron energy is shown in figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the top left panel of each figure presents electron energy within model a , with @xmath93 .",
    "the bottom left panel shows the electron energy within model b ; the electron reaches a maximum energy of a few tev at the height @xmath94 ( i.e. @xmath95 ) .",
    "the optical depth @xmath96 for nonmagnetic scattering of an electron is small ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) and thus scattering is not a relevant decelaration process of electrons .",
    "the optical depth for scattering scales as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the temperature of the radiation field .",
    "there are several factors that influence the scattering rate as a function of the height above the surface of the neutron star @xmath89 .",
    "the photon density decreases with height , but the electron spends much more time in the upper part of the magnetosphere , thus increasing the chance of scattering there .",
    "we find that the latter effect is dominant and most of the scatterings take place in the upper part of the magnetosphere between @xmath99 and @xmath100 cm , where the electron energy is close to the value of a few tev .",
    "this is illustrated in figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] ( left panels ) , where the electron energy is plotted as a function of @xmath89 .",
    "we show the energies of the ics photons and the locations of the scattering events .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum of the ics photons has a width of about one decade in energy centered around a few tev , corresponding to the range of electron energies in the region where most of the scattering occur . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we illustrate the effects of reprocessing in the pulsar magnetosphere ( taking model a as an example ) and present both , the intrinsic spectrum of ics photons ( dotted line ) and the spectrum after reprocessing due to magnetic absorption ( solid line ) .",
    "magnetic absorption removes the high energy part of the intrinsic ics spectral peak , decreasing the strength of the peak by a factor of more than 10 , and redistributing the ics photon energy to lower part of the spectrum .",
    "the ics photons subject to magnetic absorption reprocessing are located in figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] ( left panels ) above the thin line corresponding to @xmath101 ( equation  [ [ tauone ] ] ) . in the case",
    "when the soft photon source is the hot polar cap most of the ics photons will be reprocessed ; see figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "however , in the case when the photon source is a warm surface of a neutron star most of the scattering events take place at a distance of a few neutron star radii from the surface and most of the ics photons will escape freely ; see figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the escaping ics photons have typical energies equal to the electron energy at the height of few neutron star radii above the stellar surface and thus the spectrum of the ics photons exhibits a strong peak at the energy of @xmath102tev .",
    "the height of the ics peak depends on the number of the soft thermal photons in the magnetosphere , and so it is directly related to the temperature and the radiating area ( polar cap or entire stellar surface ) .",
    "another factor that influences the scattering rate is the soft photon flux anisotropy .",
    "such anisotropy results from opacity angular dependence in strong magnetic field , and can not be neglected in the case of classical pulsars with @xmath103gauss .",
    "detailed models of magnetized atmospheres show that in the case @xmath104gauss fields the soft photon flux is almost constant up to about 60 degrees .",
    "this result justifies our simplified treatment of the soft photon field as being isotropic .",
    "the dominant spectral component in the energy range from @xmath105 out to its cutoff at @xmath106 is due to curvature radiation ( see the energy spectra in figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] , right panels ) .",
    "this cutoff energy is significantly higher than that expected in some classical pulsars as well as measured in some of them ( @xmath107gev , thompson et  al . ) .",
    "this is because of smaller curvature radii implying higher values of the characteristic photon energy , and also much weaker magnetic absorption ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the slope @xmath76 of radiation energy spectrum per logarithmic energy bandwidth ( @xmath109 ) below @xmath110 is insensitive to model of acceleration , and is close to @xmath5 ( see rudak & dyks 1999 for discussion of @xmath111 ) . above @xmath112",
    "the spectrum assumes a slope which depends on the acceleration model . for model",
    "a the slope between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is @xmath113 , in agreement with simple analytical estimates for monoenergetic source function of beam particles .",
    "the slope for model b was found numerically to be equal @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "the electron acceleration in model b makes the electron spectrum harder in comparison to the case of model a , which in consequence leads to a harder cr spectrum .",
    "note , that the total energy contained in gamma rays is larger in model b than in model a ( compare right - hand panels of either figure  [ fig3 ] or figure  [ fig4 ] ) . in model",
    "a the initial energy of electrons is large enough to enable pair creation , while in model b they need to overcome the cr losses to attain @xmath115 .",
    "the work done by the electric field on the electron in model b is about 20 times larger than @xmath116 .",
    "we calculated energy spectra of pulsed he and vhe emission from millisecond pulsars for two models of beam particles acceleration .",
    "the spectra are a superposition of curvature ( cr ) , synchrotron ( sr ) , and compton upscattering ( ics ) components .",
    "the curvature component dominates the region between 1mev and 100gev .",
    "the slope of the spectrum in the range between @xmath117mev and @xmath118gev is sensitive to the details of the electron acceleration process .",
    "the synchrotron component becomes important only below @xmath119 ( rudak & dyks 1999 ) .",
    "the ics component has a narrow peak around 1tev and its strength is related to the number density of the soft photons in the magnetosphere .",
    "two sources of soft photons were considered : the hot polar cap with a uniform temperature @xmath120 , and the entire surface of the neutron star , with a lower temperature : @xmath27 .",
    "=    several new gamma - ray telescopes will be operational in the near future @xcite and thus it is interesting to discuss the observability of the he radiation from millisecond pulsars . for our ranking",
    "we have selected the millisecond pulsars from the pulsar catalog of taylor et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using the following criteria @xmath121ms and @xmath122 . for each pulsar the expected integral fluxes above @xmath117mev and above @xmath117gev was then calculated .",
    "model a had been chosen for these calculations as a more conservative one .",
    "moreover , two cases were considered for each pulsar : in addition to the case with the energy of injected primary electrons @xmath28 being chosen according to section 2.2 ( see also eq.8 of rudak & dyks 1998 ) , we also allowed the electron energy to be two times higher .",
    "this was done to present how sensitive the results are to our choice of the electron s energy .",
    "we used the results of rudak & dyks to callibrate the fluxes of primary electrons ( note that the spectra presented in figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] , are per single electron ) .",
    "ten best candidates in each band are presented in figures  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] respectively .",
    "the first two candidates for glast observations ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) , b1534 + 12 and b1821 - 24 , are objects with relatively high magnetic fields , which place them in a transition region between the domains of classical and millisecond pulsars .",
    "because of the magnetic field strength and consequently high magnetic absorption in these two objects , the high energy cutoff lies below @xmath117gev and therefore they disappear from the ranking of figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the third best candidate for glast observations is j0437 - 4715 , a pulsar located very close to the earth at the distance of @xmath123pc , with the spin period @xmath124ms , and the magnetic field at the polar cap @xmath125 g inferred from kinematically corrected @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "j0437 - 4715 is also our primary candidate for observations in the range above @xmath117gev with the future cherenkov telescopes .",

    "this object should be also visible just above the horizon by the telescope in the canary islands .",
    "the expected photon flux above @xmath117gev is @xmath139@xmath128s@xmath129 which is almost two orders of magnitude above the sensitivity of in its large zenith angle mode @xcite .",

    "our ranking list of figure  [ fig6 ] also includes j0218 + 4232 , a pulsar with a likely detection by at about @xmath141 level ( verbunt et al .",
    "1996 , kuiper & hermsen 2000 ) .",
    "our theoretical gamma ray flux for this object is a factor of up to ten below the expected sensitivity , mainly because of the large distance .",
    "thus within the model presented above we remain skeptical to this report about its positive detection , knowing that the gamma ray source is coincident with an agn .",
    "millisecond pulsars are potentially very interesting sources of high energy gamma - rays . the gamma - ray radiation ,",
    "if detected , shall provide useful information about physical conditions in a pulsar magnetosphere : the primary electron energy , the nature of the electric field accelerating the primary electrons , and indirectly soft photon density .",
