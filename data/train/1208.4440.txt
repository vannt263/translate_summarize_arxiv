    "among nontopological solitons , q - balls have attracted much attention because they can exist in all supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "specifically , they can be produced efficiently in the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism @xcite and could be responsible for baryon asymmetry @xcite and dark matter @xcite .",
    "q - balls can also influence the fate of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "based on these motivations , stability of q - balls has been intensively studied @xcite .    in spite of these concerns about q - balls ,",
    "other equilibrium solutions have not been studied so much , while topological defects have several types according to the symmetry .",
    "for example , observational consequences by cosmic strings , such as gravitational lenses and the gravitational wave have been argued for years  @xcite .    from this point of view , other types of nontopological solutions may play an important role in the the universe .",
    "recently , two types of nontopological solutions was discussed : q - tubes and q - crust , which mean tube - shaped ( or string - like ) and crust - shaped solutions , respectively @xcite . as for q - tubes ,",
    "some numerical studies manifested sign of their appearance .",
    "first , it has been reported that a filament structure appears just before q - ball formation in the numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "second , according to the simulations of the collision of two q - balls , two apparent rings are formed @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that the filament structure and the rings are q - tubes .    in @xcite numerical solutions were investigated for the potential , [ v3 ] v_3():=m^22 ^ 2-^3+^4  with   m^2 ,  ,  > 0 , which we call the @xmath0 model . in the case of q - balls",
    "@xcite , however , the charge - energy relation , which is a key of stability of the equilibrium solutions , is quite dependent on potentials @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , our first concern is how q - tube solutions depend on potentials .",
    "our second concern is how different in the charge - energy relation between q - tubes and q - balls . this shape - dependence is closely related to the dimension - dependence because a cylindrical q - tube in 3 + 1 spacetime is equivalent to a ",
    "q - ball \" in 2 + 1 spacetime if we ignore gravity .",
    "if this dimension - dependence becomes manifest , it would be useful for investigating other q - objects or those in higher - dimensional spacetime @xcite .    for these reasons",
    ", in this paper , we make a comparative study of q - balls and q - tubes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we explain briefly what q - balls and q - tubes are . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate their equilibrium solutions numerically for four types of potentials . in sec .",
    "iv , we evaluate analytically the limit values of the energy and the charge . in sec .",
    "v , we devote to concluding remarks .",
    "consider an so(2)-symmetric scalar field @xmath2 , whose action is given by [ s ] s = d^4x ,  .",
    "for a q - ball , we assume spherical symmetry and homogeneous phase rotation , [ qball - phase ] = ( r)(t , t ) .",
    "one has a field equation , [ feqball ] d^2dr^2 + 2rddr+^2=dvd .",
    "this is equivalent to the field equation for a single static scalar field with an effective potential v_=v-12 ^ 2 ^ 2 .",
    "equilibrium solutions @xmath3 with a boundary condition [ bcqball ] ddr(r=0)=0 ,  ( r)=0 , exist if min@xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this condition is rewritten as [ qexist ] min<^2<m^2(0 ) , where we have put @xmath6 without loss of generality .    for a q - ball solution",
    ", we can define the energy and the charge , respectively , as [ eqdef ] e&=&4_0^r^2 dr \\{12 ^ 2 ^ 2 + 12(ddr)^2+v},q&=&4_0^r^2 ^ 2dr .",
    "[ eqball - definition ] the @xmath7-@xmath8 relation is a key to understand stability of equilibrium solutions in terms of catastrophe theory @xcite .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )      for a q - tube , we suppose a string - like configuration , [ qtube - phase ] = ( r)((n+t),(n+t ) ) , where @xmath9 is nonnegative integer and @xmath10 is the cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "the field equation becomes [ fetube ] d^2dr^2 + 1rddr - n^2r^2+^2=dvd . in the case of @xmath11 ,",
    "the field equation is the same as ( [ feqball ] ) except for a numerical coefficient .",
    "q - ball - like solutions of @xmath12 exist if the condition ( [ qexist ] ) is satisfied .    in the case of @xmath13",
    ", there is no regular solution which satisfies @xmath14 .",
    "however , if we adopt a different boundary condition , ( r=0)=(r)=0 , there is a new type of regular solutions .",
    "we introduce an auxiliary variable @xmath15 which is defined by @xmath16 , then , eq.([fetube ] ) becomes + 2n+1rddr+^2=r^-ndvd|_=r^n if we choose @xmath17 appropriately , we obtain a solution @xmath18 which is expressed in the maclaurin series without odd powers in the neighborhood of @xmath19 . in terms of the original variable @xmath12 , the @xmath9th differential coefficient @xmath20 should be determined by the shooting method , while any lower derivative vanishes at @xmath19 .    in the same way as for q - balls @xcite , existence of q - tube solutions can be interpreted as follows .",
    "if one regards the radius @xmath21 as time  and the scalar amplitude @xmath12 as the position of a particle , one can understand @xmath11 solutions in words of newtonian mechanics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ newton](a ) .",
    "equation ( [ fetube ] ) describes a one - dimensional motion of a particle under the conserved force due to the potential @xmath22 and the time - dependent friction @xmath23 .",
    "if one chooses the initial position  @xmath24 appropriately , the static particle begins to roll down the potential slope , climbs up and approaches the origin over infinite time .",
    "similarly , we can also understand @xmath13 solutions as shown in fig .",
    "[ newton](b ) . in this case , there are two non - conserved forces , the friction @xmath23 and the repulsive force @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 , by choosing the initial velocity  @xmath27 appropriately , the particle goes down and up the slope , and at some point @xmath28 it turns back and approaches the origin over infinite time .",
    "if @xmath29 , @xmath27 vanishes ; instead , the @xmath9th derivative @xmath30 gently pushes the particle at @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , with the appropriate choice of @xmath30 , the particle moves along a similar trajectory to that of @xmath26 .",
    "this argument also indicates that the existence condition of @xmath32 solutions are the same as that of @xmath11 solutions , ( [ qexist ] ) .",
    "solutions with the same behavior as the @xmath26 solutions were obtained by kim _",
    "et al_.@xcite , who studied the so(3)-symmetric scalar field without q - charge .    because our q - ball solutions are infinitely long , the energy and the charge ( [ eqdef ] ) diverge .",
    "we therefore define the energy and the charge per unit length , respectively , as & = & 2_0^rdr \\{12 ^ 2 ^ 2 + 12(ddr)^2 + + v},&=&2_0^r^2dr .",

    "our numerical results in the last section indicate that the charge - energy relation of equilibrium solutions depends a great deal on functional forms of the potential @xmath1 . in this section",
    "we discuss what determines the extreme values of the energy and the charge by analytical methods . as we explained in sec .",
    "ii , we can understand q - balls and q - tubes in words of a particle motion in newtonian mechanics . in fig .",
    "[ newton ] , if we ignore non conserved force the maximum of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , is determined by the nontrivial solution of @xmath36 . using this @xmath37",

    "as for @xmath39 for @xmath11 or @xmath40 , it is reasonable to take @xmath41 or @xmath42 where @xmath43 becomes about @xmath44 .    what we want to discuss is whether @xmath45 and @xmath46 approach zero , infinity or nonzero finite values as @xmath47 approaches the upper or lower limit",
    ". the approximate expression ( [ tq - evaluate ] ) is appropriate for this purpose .",

    ", a particle rolls down from the top of the hill over infinite time , i.e. , @xmath52 diverges .",
    "this limit corresponds to the thin - wall limit . from the expression ( [ tq - evaluate ] ) , we see that @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath46 and @xmath55 diverge .    on the other hand , in the type ii solutions , where min@xmath48<0 $ ] , because @xmath56 , there is no limit of min@xmath57 .",
    "therefore , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath46 and @xmath55 must have their upper limits .",
    "next , we investigate the lower limit of @xmath47 , or equivalently , the upper limit of @xmath33 .",
    "this limit corresponds to the thick - wall limit . except for the @xmath58 model , @xmath59 satisfies ^2=(0 ) , which means that @xmath59 is the mass scale of @xmath51 normalized by @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the wall thickness normalized by @xmath60 is of order of @xmath61 . because the radius and the wall thickness are of the same order in the thick - wall limit , except for the @xmath58 model , we obtain _ max ,  _",

    "this explains why the results between q - tubes and q - balls are different in this model while no qualitative difference appears in the @xmath66 model .    *",

    ", we anticipate that @xmath58 has also the nonrenormalization term @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this does not change the qualitative behavior in the lower limit .",
    "however , in the upper limit , @xmath36 has degenerate solutions as in type i models .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that the charge - energy relation for @xmath58 with @xmath72 is similar to that for type i solutions in the @xmath0 model .",
