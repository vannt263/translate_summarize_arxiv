    "in studying the thermodynamic state of a physical system , the free energy @xmath0 is a quantity of fundamental importance .",
    "it describes the equilibrium properties of systems that may exchange energy with their environments .",
    "formally , it is related to the internal energy , @xmath1 , by a legendre transform @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the temperature and @xmath4 the entropy .",
    "the free energy is a state function and hence , for any process connecting two equilibrium states , the respective change of the free energy @xmath5 , solely depends on the final and initial states without regard to the particular process connecting them .",
    "in contrast , the work @xmath6 done on the system and the heat @xmath7 exchanged with the environment are process - dependent . yet , their sum yielding the change in internal energy , @xmath8 , does not depend on the details of the path connecting the final with the initial state .",
    "recently , jarzynski found a relation between the path dependent work and the path independent free energy change in terms of the following sum rule  @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the probability density function ( pdf ) of the work that is performed on the system .",
    "the process from which this work results , starts out in a state of thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath11 , and is induced by the action of forces , or more generally by changes of parameters characterizing the hamiltonian of the considered system .",
    "these parameter changes are supposed to follow a specific protocol , on the details of which the work pdf will depend in general .    in eq .",
    "( [ jarzynski ] ) , @xmath12 , denotes the difference between the free energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the initial thermal equilibrium state and the thermal equilibrium state of the system with the final parameter values , respectively .",
    "both equilibrium states are at the same temperature @xmath3 . in general",
    ", the second equilibrium state differs from the actual state that is reached at the end of the protocol . in principle",
    ", this `` associated thermal equilibrium '' will be approached when the system stays in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath3 upon completion of the protocol . as a difference of a state function",
    ", @xmath15 depends on the initial and final parameter values but is independent of the details of the protocol .",
    "the random nature of the work manifested in the pdf @xmath10 is a consequence of the inherent randomness of the thermal initial state and additionally also due to a possible randomness of the dynamics , be it of quantum or classical , stochastic nature . in the latter case ,",
    "randomness and dissipation must be properly balanced by fluctuation dissipation relations eventually imposing thermal equilibrium at the initial inverse temperature @xmath16 at constant parameter values .",
    "any application of the jarzynski equality ( [ jarzynski ] ) to experiments hence requires repeating experiments with the same protocol many times in order to generate a sufficient statistics . the same requirement to generate sufficiently many data",
    "must also be met in numerical implementations of the jarzynski equality aiming at the determination of free energy changes .    the feasibility of this scheme with the goal to determine the free energy change @xmath15 was demonstrated in various experimental systems such as for single molecules  @xcite and classical oscillators  @xcite .",
    "yet the practical applicability of the jarzynski equality is severely limited because the estimate of the exponential work average strongly relies on how well the tail of the work distribution with @xmath17 is sampled  @xcite .",
    "in general the exponential average @xmath18 gives rise to a bias of the jarzynski free energy estimate  @xcite .",
    "it is now well recognized that the best convergence can be obtained from slow protocols associated with small dissipation such that @xmath19 , i.e. , for almost reversible processes in which the system passes through a succession of quasi - equilibrium states  @xcite .",
    "for fast switching , the finite sampling error becomes substantial both concerning the bias and the variance .",
    "the respective behavior in the large sampling limit was investigated in several studies  @xcite .    an alternative strategy to determine free energy differences",
    "is based on the crooks relation  @xcite , @xmath20 which allows to infer @xmath15 without the average process required in eq.([jarzynski ] ) . here",
    "the two work pdfs @xmath21 and @xmath22 refer to the original , or forward ( @xmath23 ) protocol and to the backward protocol ( @xmath24 ) which is started in the associated equilibrium state , i.e. , at the initial temperature of the forward process and at those parameter values that have finally been reached in the forward process and retraces its parameter values .",
    "the free energy change can be read off from a plot displaying the functions @xmath21 and @xmath25 as the work value at which the two distributions cross each other .",
    "a reliable estimate of the crossing point requires sufficient sampling of work with @xmath17 for the forward and respectively with @xmath26 for the backward process .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning here that the _ average _ work is never smaller than the free energy change , i.e. @xmath27 , as a consequence of jensen s inequality , stating that @xmath28 .",
    "hence , the work applied to the system in an isothermal process is at least as large as the change of free energy , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the amount of work that is equal to the free energy change can be applied to the system in an isothermal reversible process , while any surplus @xmath29 is `` dissipated work '' .",
    "the dissipated work can also be interpreted in terms of the entropy change of the total system including the heat - bath , @xmath30  @xcite , which , again is positive in accordance with the second law . for rapid protocols ,",
    "the dissipated work becomes large and therefore those realizations of the process with @xmath31 may become extremely unlikely , such that even large samples obtained from experiments or numerical investigations may result in an unpopulated no man s land between the forward and the backward work pdfs and , hence , in an unreliable estimate of the free energy change based on crooks crossing criterion .",
    "dividing both sides of the crooks relation  ( [ crooks ] ) by the factor of @xmath32 , one obtains @xmath33 this equation was originally suggested by bennett  @xcite as an efficient basis to estimate partition function ratios by means of monte carlo sampling . in bennett s",
    "derivation , the fermi - function - like weights in eq .",
    "( [ bennett ] ) resulted as acceptance ratios from the requirement of minimal variance of the partition function estimator in the large sample size limit . from the gaussian assumption which this argument underlies one would be let to believe that the bennett estimator yields minimal variance only if the overlap region of the forward and backward pdfs @xmath21 and @xmath25 is substantially populated .",
    "however , shirts et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that bennett s acceptance ratio method always yields a maximum likelihood estimate of the free energy change by the use of forward and backward data .",
    "as such , it allows to extract @xmath15 with the smallest variance compared to any other free energy estimator , even if the two pdfs , @xmath34 and @xmath35 do not overlap .",
    "therefore , the estimation of the free energy change from eq .",
    "( 3 ) is less restricted than the jarzynski method and crooks crossing criterion as has been confirmed in various recent studies  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the statistical behavior of the free energy change estimation by the bennett method , discuss its limitations imposed by the difference of the amounts of dissipated work in the forward and backward protocol , and compare it with the methods proposed by jarzynski and crooks .",
    "in our discussion we lay particular emphasis on the practical limitations resulting from the nonequilibrium nature that is imposed on the system by time dependent perturbations .",
    "we begin in section ii with a brief review on how the dissipated work and the time asymmetry constrain the jarzynski and crooks method . in the following section iii ,",
    "we shortly review the maximum likelihood argument @xcite leading to eq .",
    "( [ bennett ] ) and examine its solutions in some limiting cases .",
    "in particular when the jarzynski and crooks methods are both hampered by large dissipated work , we show that the bennett method simplifies to the `` 1/2-formula '' expressing the free energy change as the arithmetic mean of the jarzynski estimation obtained from the forward and the backward process . in sec .",
    "iv , we take as an example a gaussian chain , and consider processes in which work is done by extending or compressing the chain at a constant speed .",
    "reliable estimations of @xmath15 based on crooks crossing criterion or the jarzynski estimator do not exist if the dissipated work becomes large .",
    "we present regions in a pulling - speed versus sample - size plane , in which the errors of these estimators are smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "for the gaussian chain , the dissipated works in the forward and backward processes are the same , and , as a consequence the bennett method gives precise estimations of @xmath15 . in sec .",
    "vi , we consider a chain of monomers interacting via pairing potentials to form a hairpin - like structure .",
    "keeping one end fixed and pulling at the other end with constant speed gives rise to a non - gaussian work distribution with different dissipated works for the forward and the backward protocols .",
    "the difference increases with growing pulling speed and leads to a finite bias of the bennett estimator .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "we consider a time dependent perturbation of a system in terms of a control parameter @xmath37 that varies in time @xmath38 according to a prescribed protocol .",
    "the protocol can be performed in bidirectional way . for the forward protocol during a time interval @xmath39 , the system departs from its initial thermal equilibrium state at temperature @xmath3 and control parameter @xmath40 and reaches a terminal state with @xmath41 , which , in general , is a nonequilibrium state . the work done during this process will be referred to as the forward work . for the backward protocol ,",
    "the system starts out in thermal equilibrium at the same inverse temperature @xmath16 with the control parameter at @xmath41 . in this case",
    ", the parameter retraces its values in time - reversed order and finally reaches @xmath42 as terminal parameter value . after repeating infinitely many times both protocols , two probability distribution functions , @xmath34 for the forward and @xmath43 for the backward protocol , can be assembled .     to obtain a work smaller than the free energy change in a realization of the forward process",
    "is displayed as a function of the dissipated work @xmath44 for a gaussian process as given by eq .",
    "almost reversible protocols with small dissipated work give a probability @xmath45 close to the maximum @xmath46 . in the opposite limit of large dissipated work @xmath45 becomes exponentially small . ]    as mentioned in the introduction , the probability for observing work less than the free energy change is the crucial factor for the applicability of the crooks crossing criterion . for the forward process",
    "this probability is given by @xmath47 and , accordingly , for the backward process , by @xmath48 if these probabilities are too low to get a sufficient number of realizations of work below the free energy change within a reasonable total number of experiments , the crooks crossing criterion fails to give @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , a poor sampling of work data below @xmath15 will lead to a substantial underestimation of the exponential average @xmath18 resulting in a too large jarzynski estimate of @xmath15 .    as an example , we consider a gaussian work pdf @xmath21 for the forward process . as a consequence of the crooks relation  ( [ crooks ] )",
    "the backward work pdf @xmath22 is also gaussian with the same variance @xmath49 .",
    "hence the two pdfs are : @xmath50 , \\quad \\alpha = f , b\\:.\\ ] ] in this case the free energy change becomes @xmath51 .",
    "the probability of finding work less than the free energy change in the forward protocol then becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the complementary error function , see fig .  1 .",
    "if the process is weakly dissipative , i.e for @xmath54 , the forward work distribution becomes narrow and the argument of the error function is small . because of @xmath55 for @xmath56 , the probability @xmath57 approaches the value @xmath46 in the limit of vanishing dissipated work  @xcite . in other words , on average , every other measurement probes a work that is less than the free energy change ( fig .  1 ) . in the opposite limit of a strongly dissipative process being characterized by @xmath58 ,",
    "the work pdfs become broad because then @xmath59 . using the asymptotic behavior of @xmath53 for @xmath60 , @xmath61",
    ", we obtain an exponentially small probability @xmath62 to find a work in the forward protocol that is less than the free energy change .",
    "defined by eq .  ( 6 ) for a gaussian pdf monotonicly varies as a function of the hysteresis @xmath63 from vanishingly small values at small @xmath64 to a maximal value at large @xmath64 .",
    "note that the hysteresis @xmath64 gives the average dissipated work for the forward and the backward protocol , and , for a gaussian work distribution , characterizes the separation of the peaks of the forward and backward work pdfs @xmath21 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the pdfs at the values indicated by the arrows in panel ( a ) are displayed in the panels ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "( b ) for weak dissipation ( @xmath65 ) , the time asymmetry is small ( @xmath66 ) and the work pdfs display a large overlapping area near @xmath15 .",
    "( c ) for strong dissipation ( @xmath67 ) , the time asymmetry approaches its maximum ( @xmath68 ) and the work pdfs are well - separated . ]",
    "a measure quantifying the difference between the forward and the backward work pdfs @xmath21 and @xmath25 based on the jensen - shannon divergence of the two distributions is given by the so - called time asymmetry  @xcite reading @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote averages with respect to the forward and the backward distributions , respectively .",
    "this quantity vanishes when @xmath21 and @xmath25 agree with each other and otherwise falls in the range @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , if the measured work values are mostly populated in the close vicinity of the free energy change , @xmath15 for the forward protocol and @xmath73 for the backward protocol , the time asymmetry approaches its minimum value @xmath74 .",
    "in this case , @xmath34 and @xmath35 have a large overlap .",
    "on the other hand , the time asymmetry reaches its maximum @xmath75 when @xmath34 and @xmath35 are perfectly separated by a large gap between the respective regions with @xmath76 for the forward protocol and @xmath77 for the backward protocol .",

    "strictly speaking , due to the crooks relation  ( [ crooks ] ) @xmath34 and @xmath35 must share the same support and therefore always have a finite overlap , which , however , may become virtually invisible .",
    "little overlap of the forward and the backward work pdfs indicates that the process involved in the work generation is highly irreversible , and hence , the direction of time flow is unambiguous giving the information @xmath75 of a single bit .",
    "also , for this case , large dissipated work is associated with both processes , and the probabilities @xmath81 and @xmath82 to find work values being less than the free energy change become extremely small ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) . in summary",
    ", the more pronounced is the direction of the time - arrow in a nonequilibrium process , the rarer it becomes to find events with work smaller than the free energy change and the more erroneous both estimators by jarzynski and crooks turn out to be .",
    "finally , we note a relation between the time asymmetry and the hysteresis @xmath64 specifying the average dissipated work of the forward and the backward protocol . because the free energy does not change upon completion of a cyclic process , the total dissipated work agrees with twice the above introduced work hysteresis , @xmath83 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hysteresis gives a rough estimate for the number of measurements @xmath84 required for a relatively reliable estimation of @xmath15 based on the jarzynski equality , as @xmath85 . on the other hand the hysteresis",
    "is related to the time asymmetry by the following inequality  @xcite , @xmath86 as a consequence the required number of measurements becomes infinitely large if the time asymmetry approaches the limiting value , @xmath75 .",

    "in contrast , for the fast protocol shown in the panel ( b ) , the two histograms do not overlap , and therefore , do not allow to extract @xmath15 from the crooks relation .",
    "moreover , these histograms are no longer mirror symmetric ; the forward histogram is significantly more dispersed than the backward histogram .",
    "we also present the biases of the free energy estimators in fig .",

    "the monotonic increase of both quantities as functions of the time - ratio @xmath271 leads to a proportionality between the bias of the bennett estimator and the difference between the dissipated works in the forward and backward protocols confirming the previous conjecture .",
    "the influence of the difference between the dissipated forward and backward works on the bennett estimator can be understood qualitatively , at least in the limit of large dissipation . according to eq .",
    "( [ half ] ) , in this limit , the bennett estimator can be expressed by half of the difference of the jarzynski estimators for the forward and the backward protocol . for a gaussian work distribution the forward and the backward distributions @xmath21 and @xmath25 are symmetric with respect to @xmath15 and consequently",
    ", the biases of the two estimators are identical and compensate each other in the 1/2 formula . on the other hand , in all cases with different dissipated works of the forward and the backward processes ,",
    "the symmetry of the forward and backward distributions is apparently lost and therefore the forward and the backward jarzynski estimators will have different biases , which then no longer compensate each other in the 1/2 formula .    .",
    "the statistical error bars are smaller than the size of symbols . with increasing speed",
    ", the jarzynski bias and the dissipated work of the forward and the backward process grow fast . at the same time but at a much slower rate also the difference between the forward and the backward dissipated work as well as the bias of the bennett estimator increase .",
    "( b ) the bennett bias is shown to be proportional to the difference between dissipated works , @xmath272 in the forward process and @xmath273 in the backward process . ]",
    "in summary , we discussed the statistical behaviors of the free energy estimators based on the jarzynski equality , crooks crossing criterion , and bennett s acceptance ratio method , in relation to the amount of dissipated work and the time asymmetry .",
    "in particular , we investigated the limiting behaviors of the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ bennett ] ) and demonstrated that while both the jarzynski and the crooks method are hampered by large dissipated work , the finite sampling error of bennett s method is determined by the _ difference _ of the dissipated works of the forward and the backward processes . as a consequence , it is less severely influenced by the entropy production but rather by the asymmetry between the forward and the backward process .",
    "the examples of a gaussian and a non - gaussian chain considered here demonstrate these features .",
    "the finite sampling error of the jarzynski estimator rapidly increases with the amount of dissipated work .",
    "the crooks estimator has a binary character : either it yields a reliable solution , as long as the forward and the backward work pdfs overlap , or provides no solution at all . at best an upper and a lower bound",
