    "in this paper , we study the thermal conductivity tensor using the 3d homogenization method for materials constituted of 3 phases .",
    "since composite materials are widely used in modern industry , there has been a number of works studying their effective properties : they concern descriptions of modelling approaches as well as results of experimental measurements .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the range of application and features for existing modelling approaches , and at the same time the work is motivated by precise application within the framework of an industrial project .",
    "+ the importance of modelling for the analysis of composite materials results from various challenges in carrying out experimental works : such problems include purely technical difficulties as well as financial optimization of the applied activities .",
    "it is thus necessary to master modelling approaches that are reliable , comparable with experiment , and still affordable from the point of view of computational efficiency .",
    "our strategy in this paper is related to the idea of stochastic homogenization .",
    "we consider samples of a composite material containing coated inclusions ; and in order to take into account possible imperfections and random factors , we average the result for a series of tests representing the same macro characteristics . for this work we have chosen to study relatively simple geometry of inclusions :",
    "spherical shape with uniform coating .",
    "on the one hand this permits to concentrate on the details of application of the adopted modelling technique , on the other hand this can still provide some insight on the influence of morphology on the effective properties of composite materials .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain the rsa ( random sequential adsorption ) method chosen for the generation of rves ( representative volume elements ) proposed in @xcite and we give the context of the study .",
    "next , we recall the model used with the computational method . in the third section",
    "we compare the fft ( fast fourier transform)-based homogenization technique and the finite elements method ( fem ) for simple geometries and we motivate our choice of the fft - based ` accelerated scheme ' .",
    "the last section describes the numerical results .",
    "we conclude by recapitulating the main points of this work and describing the work in progress .",
    "in this section , we describe the method used to generate rves with three phases .",
    "as we have outlined in the introduction , we consider a material with the matrix , the spherical inclusions and the coating media .",
    "+ we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we generate rves using the tool developed by v. salnikov et al . in @xcite . with this tool using the rsa algorithm generation method , we are able to generate three phased rves containing up to @xmath0 identical spherical inclusions and up to @xmath1 in volume fraction . in the cited paper , it has been shown that the method is very efficient being able to generate such rves in fractions of a second .",
    "the described algorithm produces a list of inclusions in a `` vector '' form namely for each sphere coordinates of the center ( in 3d ) and the radius .",
    "the spheres do not overlap . in the second step ,",
    "we use a voxelization tool ( @xcite ) to obtain a voxelized sample with three phases .",
    "we add a coating defined by the user for each spherical inclusion .",
    "the figure [ fig1 ] shows a scheme representing a section of a sphere with the notations used throughout the article . in the sequel , we note @xmath2 the layer which is the ratio between the coating width and the radius of a sphere @xmath3 , the layer is thus a number between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . on the figures [ figrve ] , we see one 3d rve voxelization and two of theses sections .    ]     voxels representing the top face and one of these center sections , title=\"fig : \" ]   voxels representing the top face and one of these center sections , title=\"fig : \" ]   voxels representing the top face and one of these center sections , title=\"fig : \" ]    the setting of the study is the following : we fix the parameters like the volume fraction of spheres @xmath6 equal to @xmath7 ( which takes into account spherical inclusion and coating ) and the phases conductivity tensor for each phase equals to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a positive number ( it takes 3 different values for the 3 materials and @xmath10 stands for the identity matrix in dimension 3 .",
    "+ in this setting , we study how the thermal properties of a composite vary depending on a geometrical parameter denominated as the layer keeping in mind that the spherical volume fraction is fixed here at @xmath7 .",
    "for this purpose , we generated samples with different quantity of spheres and different resolutions to observe the behaviour of the composite .",
    "consider a representative volume element @xmath11 with periodic boundary conditions , and denote @xmath12 the temperature , @xmath13 the heat flux and @xmath14 the thermal conductivity at any point @xmath15 .",
    "+ fourier s law in the linear case states that : @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , we suppose that we are in stationary phase and without heat source so the heat flux verifies @xmath17 .",
    "notice that for a composite material , the thermal conductivity tensor depends on the point @xmath18 : the dependence is governed by microscopic geometry of the sample , namely which phase ( matrix , inclusion or coating ) the point belongs to .",
    "+ the volume element @xmath11 is subjected to an average temperature gradient @xmath19 which induces local temperature gradient @xmath20 and heat flux @xmath13 inside the rve .",
    "the effective constitutive relations of the composite are the relations between the ( spatial ) average flux @xmath21 and average temperature gradient @xmath22 . + it is a common practice to introduce a constant reference tensor @xmath23 to solve the problem of recovering the local fields and gradients . introducing this homogeneous linear tensor",
    ", we can rewrite the problem as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the polarization tensor . + the solution of ( 1 ) can be expressed in real and fourier spaces , where @xmath26 denotes the fourier image of @xmath27 and @xmath28 s are the coordinates in the fourier space , respectively , with the help of the periodic green operator @xmath29 associated with @xmath23 we can also write : @xmath30 or in fourier space : @xmath31 the equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the lippmann - schwinger integral equations in real and fourier spaces respectively .",
    "the green operator @xmath32 is easily expressed and computed in the fourier space by : @xmath33    the lippmann - schwinger equation can be solved iteratively using the algorithm based on the accelerated scheme proposed by eyre and milton in @xcite and written as algorithm 3 in @xcite for the elastic case . for the thermal conductivity case ,",
    "we obtain with adapted notations the following algorithm : +    * algorithm : * _ fft - based homogenization scheme for thermal conductivity case _ + _ initialize @xmath34 , fix the convergence criterion acc . _",
    "+ _ while ( not converged ) _    [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     we also note for resolution @xmath35 voxels that the number of spheres almost does not influence the computed values , which agrees with the definition of acceptable rve size and means we no longer have the artefact due to the voxelization .",
    "moreover , for a layer @xmath2 equal to @xmath36 , there is a kind of stagnation , it is shown on figures [ fig.30layer ] , [ fig.70layer ] , [ fig.100layer ] . on these figures , we clearly observe two behaviours , one before the stagnation and the other one during the stagnation .",
    "this effect is less visible in resolution @xmath37 since it is difficult to capture the coating when the layer is too low which appears in figures [ voids ] . from the point of view of applications we can say that it is not necessary to have a big coating to increase the homogenized thermal conductivity .",
    "there is a limit due to the sphere volume fraction and due to the type of spherical inclusions .",
    "to conclude , we can summarize the main ideas of this paper .",
    "we have shown that the fft - based iterative accelerated scheme is a good tool for computing thermal effective properties of a composite generated randomly in 3d .",
    "we have restricted our study to rve composed with only spheres but it can be made with cylinders or both spheres and cylinders . in @xcite , rves generation algorithms in md ( molecular dynamics ) or rsa methods have been presented using both spheres and cylinders and in @xcite these rves have been used for calculations in elastic case .",
    "+ we have observed that the resolution @xmath35 with @xmath38 spheres and an sufficient thickness of the layer gives good results .",
    "we have also noted that the coating must be thick enough in order to be `` captured '' . in our work in progress , we explore the case with a thin coating , where the methods are more subtle and some preparation of the samples is needed .",
    "we will address this issue as well as more advanced morphological parameters in a separate publication .",
    "most of the computations described in this paper have been carried out at the cluster of the centre of informatics resources of higher normandy ( crihan - centre de ressources informatiques de haute - normandie ) . + this work has been supported by accea project selected by the `` fonds unique interministriel ( fui ) 15 ( 18/03/2013 ) '' program .    9 v. salnikov , d. choi , ph .",
