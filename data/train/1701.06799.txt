    "<S> we performed also a broadband scattering characterization of the @xmath12 design . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was illuminated from below with white light , and the reflected and scattered light was spectrally decomposed into its wavelength and momentum components ( fig .  [ fig : kingswhitelightscattering]b ) by spectrally imaging the fourier plane of the sample . in this way </S>",

    "<S> we now seek to characterise the hud metasurface electromagnetic modes and their momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the metasurface modes are excited by a @xmath26  nm layer of poly(methyl methacrylate ) polymer highly doped with fluorescent 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4h - pyran ( dcm ) dye molecules which was spin coated on the samples ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we designed the structure factor to be dominated by a single , broad scattering resonance which was observed to dictate both the annular farfield light scattering and directional emission properties of the metasurfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the observed hud metasurface dispersion corresponds to an effective medium band that is back - folded by bragg - like processes . </S>",
    "<S> surface plasmon resonance where found to contribute to the diffraction by inducing additional peaks from their interaction with the structural diffraction peak . </S>",
    "<S> the observed light emission and scattering engineering has important applications for light extraction from light - emitting devices , absorption in solar cells and annular redirection for displays , by exploiting the full azimuthal symmetry provided by the hud metasurfaces design . </S>"
