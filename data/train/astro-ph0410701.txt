    "high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy performed with _",
    "chandra _ and xmm - newton allows very detailed studies of coronae about cool stars . while many individual emission lines were detected for the first time in stellar spectra by the extreme ultraviolet explorer satellite ( euve ; see , e.g. , drake etal .",
    "1996 ) , the resolving power of @xmath1 of the euve spectrographs was a quite modest compared with that of present day x - ray observatories . in particular , the unprecedented resolution capabilities of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory low energy transmission grating spectrograph ( letg ) in the 30 - 170    range ( @xmath2 ) that overlaps with the euve short wavelength spectrometer ( 70 - 170   ) , have revealed many more weak spectral lines .",
    "owing largely to a historical lack of attention to the 30 - 170    range , a large fraction of these remain unidentified .",
    "identification of these features is desirable because they could be used as a spectroscopic diagnostics , because they potentially contribute to the flux of diagnostic lines currently employed , and because they contribute to the overall plasma radiative loss .",
    "two nearby stars that have illuminated the forest of lines in the 30 - 170    range are  ( g2v+k1v ) and  ( f5iv ) .",
    "all three stars exhibit classical solar - like x - ray emitting coronae .",
    "indeed , analogues of the relatively x - ray faint sun are difficult to observe because they become unreachable with current instrumentation beyond a few parsecs , and  and  represent the nearest and brightest coronal sources with solar - like activity .",
    "only a small fraction of the multitude of lines between 30 - 170    seen their _ chandra _ letg spectra could be identified based on current radiative loss models ( raassen etal .  2002 , 2003 ) .",

    "have estimated that these models underestimate the true line flux in the range 30 - 70    in these stars by factors of up to 5 or so .",
    "the `` missing lines '' are predominantly transitions involving @xmath3 ground states in abundant elements such as ne , mg , si , s and ar  the analogous transitions to the fe `` l - shell '' lines between @xmath4 - 18   , together with fe @xmath5 ( the `` m - shell '' ) transitions ( drake 1996 , jordan 1996 ) . some of these lines have been identified based on electron beam ion trap experiments ( beiersdorfer etal .  1999 , lepson etal .  2002 , 2003 ) . in the present paper",
    "we approach this problem from a new perspective , namely through a _",

    "has an effective temperature of 200000k .",
    "it belongs to the pg1159 spectral class , which are hot , hydrogen - deficient ( pre- ) white dwarfs .",
    "their surface chemistry ( typical abundances : he=33% , c=48% , o=17% , + ne=2% , mass fractions ) suggests that they exhibit matter from the helium - buffer layer between the h- and he - burning shells in the progenitor agb star ( werner 2001 ) .",
    "this is likely because the pg1159 stars have suffered a late he - shell flash , a phenomenon that drives the fast evolutionary rates of such famous stars like fgsge and sakurai s object .",
    "is in fact a peculiar member of this class , because it is also helium - deficient . its atmosphere is mainly composed of carbon and oxygen plus neon and magnesium ( c=48% , o=48% , ne=2% , o=2% , mass fractions ) .",
    "is a unique object , considering its high  and chemical surface composition , and we have speculated that it represents the naked c / o core of a former red giant ( werner etal .",

    "the difference in particle densities in the wd photosphere and in the coronae amounts to many orders of magnitude ( roughly n@xmath6=@xmath7 and @xmath8@xmath9 , respectively ) , however , the temperature in the line forming regions of the wd ( up to 300000k ) is comparable to the low - temperature component of multi - temperature fits to coronae , required to account for the lines of low - ionisation stages ( e.g.  630000k for procyon ; raassen etal .",
    "2002 ) . as a consequence , numerous lines from , and",
    "are visible in the soft x - ray spectra of both , the cool star coronae ( in emission ) and the hot wd photosphere ( in absorption ) .",
    "lines from higher ionisation stages are formed in the high - temperature regions of the coronae ( t of the order 12.5 million k for the stars studied in this paper ) , hence , their respective absorption line counterparts can not be formed in the wd photosphere .",
