    "cold interstellar clouds are known to contain a rich variety of molecules whose synthesis has long been thought to rely on gas - phase ion - neutral chemical reactions @xcite . since the 1990s , chemical kinetic experiments have demonstrated that many gas - phase neutral - neutral reactions in which at least one of the reactants is a radical are very rapid at low temperatures @xcite and thus play an important role in interstellar chemistry @xcite . because cold interstellar clouds have extremely low temperatures , usually around 10 k , only gas - phase chemical reactions which are exothermic and barrierless",
    "are considered in reaction networks currently used to model the chemistry of cold interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "recently , the reaction of hydroxyl ( oh ) radicals and methanol ( ch@xmath0oh ) has been experimentally found to be very rapid at temperatures down to 56 k , despite the presence of an energy barrier , which is probably surpassed by quantum tunnelling @xcite .",
    "this finding has important potential implications for the chemistry of the interstellar medium .",
    "indeed , the empirical evidence of a chemical reaction that overcomes an energy barrier at low temperatures opens the possibility to find other reactions with a similar behaviour ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that could be potentially important for interstellar chemistry albeit to date they are not included in chemical models .",
    "hitherto , reaction kinetic databases used to model interstellar chemistry , such as umist and kida @xcite , are largely based on data obtained at temperatures above 200 k @xcite .",
    "in particular , the rate constant of the reaction between oh and ch@xmath0oh , which can be represented by the expression @xmath6",
    "@xmath3 molecule@xmath4 s@xmath4 in the temperature range 210 - 300 k @xcite , was previously presumed to be negligible at interstellar temperatures .",
    "there are two possible pathways for the titled reaction :    [ reac:1 ] @xmath7    the branching ratios of channels ( [ reac:1a ] ) and ( [ reac:1b ] ) were reported to depend on temperature between 70 and 900 k @xcite . at temperatures above 250 k ,",
    "the formation of hydroxymethyl ( ch@xmath8oh ) radicals is favoured , while at much lower temperatures the formation of ch@xmath0o via reaction ( [ reac:1a ] ) was reported to be the major reaction pathway @xcite . at 82 k , it was found experimentally that the formation of ch@xmath0o in the reaction of oh with methanol occurs at a similar rate than the removal of oh radicals @xcite .",
    "master equation calculations performed by @xcite corroborated the experimental observations and indicated that at 70 k , ch@xmath0o radicals are expected to be formed with a @xmath9 yield .",
    "for that reason , channel ( [ reac:1a ] ) and its rate coefficient , @xmath10 , are referred henceforth to as reaction  ( [ reac:1 ] ) and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "@xcite recently detected ch@xmath0o toward the cold dense cloud barnard 1b ( b1-b ) where the gas kinetic temperature is 10 - 15 k. taking into account that methanol is @xmath12 times more abundant than ch@xmath0o in b1-b @xcite , cernicharo et al .",

    "methanol concentrations were varied in ur1 by changing the pressure inside the ch@xmath0oh bubbling column using a micrometric valve . in uclm , [ ch@xmath0oh ] was varied by changing the mass flow rate of the diluted mixture from the storage bulb .",

    "up to 48 kinetic experiments were carried out at a single temperature , using different mixing ratios of the ch@xmath0oh / bath gas mixtures in the storage bulb . in the ur1 apparatus , between 14 and 21",
    "kinetic experiments were performed for each laval nozzle .      in order to evaluate the role of reaction  ( [ reac:1 ] ) in the formation of ch@xmath0o in b1-b",
    ", we have built a chemical model adopting typical conditions of a cold dense cloud , i.e. , a temperature of 10 k , a visual extinction of 30 mag , a cosmic - ray ionization rate of h@xmath8 of @xmath38 s@xmath4 , and the so - called `` low - metal '' elemental abundances ( see @xcite ) .",
    "according to @xcite , the volume density of h@xmath8 in b1-b has a steep radial gradient and takes values from a few @xmath39 @xmath26 at the core center to @xmath40 @xmath26 in the outer regions of the cloud ( at some tens of arcsec from the center ) .",
    "since methanol has a widespread distribution in b1-b @xcite , and methoxy has probably a similar distribution , we adopted densities of h nuclei of @xmath41 @xmath26 and @xmath42 @xmath26 to investigate the effect of density .",
    "since in cold dense clouds , grain - surface chemistry is hampered by the low mobility of most species on ice surfaces at the low temperatures of dust , and since we aim at evaluating the efficiency of gas - phase routes to ch@xmath0o , we did not consider chemical reactions on grain surfaces other than the formation of h@xmath8 by recombination of two h atoms .",
    "we adopted the gas - phase reaction network of @xcite with the rate coefficient for reaction  ( [ reac:1 ] ) updated according to this work .",
    "since it is well known that pure gas - phase chemical models severely underestimate the gas - phase abundance of ch@xmath0oh in cold dense clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , to be more realistic , we assumed an abundance of methanol relative to co of @xmath43 , which is the value in b1-b according to the abundances of co and ch@xmath0oh derived by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the kinetic information on the gas - phase reactivity of ch@xmath0o is quite scarce and limited to temperatures above 200 k. theoretical and experimental studies indicate that reactions of ch@xmath0o with molecules such as h@xmath8 , co , ch@xmath44 , nh@xmath0 , or ch@xmath0oh have important activation barriers @xcite .",
    "the depletion of ch@xmath0o in cold dense clouds is likely to be dominated by reactions with h and o atoms ,    [ reac:6 ] @xmath45    [ reac:7 ] @xmath46    whose rate coefficients are however not known at interstellar temperatures .",
    "we have adopted the same values used by @xcite ) given in table a2 of @xcite should read @xmath47 @xmath3 molecule@xmath4 s@xmath4 instead of @xmath48 @xmath3 molecule@xmath4 s@xmath4 . ] for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are based on measurements at 300 k @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the absence of grain - surface processes , the chemistry of ch@xmath0o becomes rather simple in the model as it is assumed to be formed through reaction  ( [ reac:1 ] ) and destroyed by reactions  ( [ reac:6 ] ) and ( [ reac:7 ] ) .",
    "therefore , at steady state the ch@xmath0o / ch@xmath0oh abundance ratio is given by : @xmath51}{\\rm [ ch_3oh ] } = \\frac{k_1 \\rm [ oh]}{k_6 \\rm [ h ] + { \\emph k_7 } [ o ] } , \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is well constrained by our experiments and thus the major source of uncertainty in the calculated ch@xmath0o / ch@xmath0oh abundance ratio comes from the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 at low temperatures .",
    "the knowledge of the methanol concentration is one of the key parameters to derive a reliable rate coefficient from equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) . for that reason ,",
    "an evaluation of the potential effect of any side reaction that could deplete methanol is desirable .",
    "no photolysis of methanol is expected at the photolysis ( 248 nm or 266 nm ) and excitation ( 282 nm ) wavelengths at the concentration levels and the low laser fluences ( less than 1 mj @xmath54 per laser pulse measured at the exit of the nozzle in uclm and 75 mj per laser pulse in ur1 measured at the exit of the laser ) used in this work , if we consider an upper limit for the absorption cross section of 10@xmath55 @xmath56 molecule@xmath4 @xcite .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , a slight curvature in the plots of @xmath37 versus [ ch@xmath0oh ] was observed at methanol concentrations higher than @xmath57 molecule @xmath26 for the lowest temperature , 22 k. this curvature was also observed by @xcite at 56 k for reaction  ( [ reac:1 ] ) for methanol concentrations higher than @xmath58 molecule @xmath26 .",
    "this may be explained by a clustering process that reduces the amount of methanol available for reacting with oh radicals , leading to a decrease of the measured pseudo - first order rate coefficient @xmath32 . the lower the temperature is , the more favourable the cluster formation is , shifting the curvature in the pseudo - first order plots to much lower methanol concentrations .",
    "@xcite observed the formation of clusters of methanol , and even the formation of small droplets in the divergent section of a laval nozzle at 210 k , although the methanol concentration in their experiments was around 4 orders of magnitude higher than in ours .",
    "therefore , we believe that under our experimental conditions the clusters that are formed are mainly methanol dimers . in order to estimate the effect of dimerization in the measurement of the pseudo - first order coefficients , a simple model has been developed using facsimile software for the worst scenario , i.e. , the lowest temperature where the gas density is the highest ( see table  [ tab:2 ] ) .",

    "recently , @xcite reported experimental evidence of the formation of the hydrogen bonded intermediate oh@xmath63ch@xmath0oh by he nanodroplet isolation ( hendi ) and a combination of mass spectrometry and infrared laser stark spectroscopy .",
    "as stated in section  [ sec : intro ] , the reaction of oh with ch@xmath0oh may have important implications for interstellar chemistry since it acts as a sink of methanol and a source of ch@xmath0o radicals .",
    "in particular , here we are interested in evaluating whether this reaction can explain the observed abundance of ch@xmath0o in the cold dense core b1-b , @xmath79 relative to h@xmath8 or @xmath5 with respect to ch@xmath0oh @xcite .",
    "o relative to h@xmath8 are shown as a function of time .",
    "solid and dashed lines correspond to densities of h nuclei of @xmath41 @xmath26 and @xmath42 @xmath26 , respectively . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the time evolution of the predicted fractional abundances of the reactants involved in reaction  ( [ reac:1 ] ) , oh and ch@xmath0oh , and the reaction product ch@xmath0o for two different densities of h nuclei . it is seen that methanol reaches its maximum abundance soon after a few @xmath80 yr ( remember that the abundance of ch@xmath0oh has been fixed to @xmath43 relative to co ) , while the methoxy radical increases its abundance progressively until reaching the maximum at late times .",
    "the range of abundances of ch@xmath0o relative to methanol , @xmath81(ch@xmath0o)/@xmath81(ch@xmath0oh ) , achieved within a time range between @xmath82 yr and @xmath83 yr are listed in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "our chemical model predicts that at @xmath84 yr , @xmath81(ch@xmath0o)/@xmath81(ch@xmath0oh ) reaches a value of @xmath85 or @xmath86 , depending on the adopted density of h nuclei .",
    "this ratio is somewhat lower , although of the same order , than the one observed in b1-b .",
    "the main uncertainty in the calculated ch@xmath0o / ch@xmath0oh abundance ratio arises from the depletion rate of ch@xmath0o , which in turn depends on the rate coefficients of the reactions of ch@xmath0o with h and o atoms and on the abundances of h and o atoms , both species being very difficult to observe in cold dense clouds .",
    "nonetheless , with current constraints on the destruction rate of ch@xmath0o , the title reaction is rapid enough at low temperatures to provide an efficient pure gas - phase pathway to ch@xmath0o radicals in b1-b .",
    "thus , our results indicate that gas - phase formation of ch@xmath0o via reaction  ( [ reac:1 ] ) , even though it does not fully interpret the observed abundance of methoxy radicals in b-1b , is likely to be a major contributor . up to now",
    ", it is thought that the main competing process of formation of ch@xmath0o is its synthesis on grain surfaces and further non - thermal desorption to the gas phase . as @xcite pointed out ,",
    "experiments that simulate ice mantle processing by ultraviolet or ion irradiation indicate that it is not the ch@xmath0o isomer , but the more stable isomer ch@xmath8oh , which is formed on grain surfaces .",
    "this was proven by @xcite , who observed ch@xmath8oh in the x - ray irradiation of methanol ice at 14 k. the warming up of these ices produces ethylene glycol ( ch@xmath8oh)@xmath8 indicating that the abundance of ch@xmath8oh radicals is high .",
    "more recently , @xcite observed that ch@xmath0o formed in the 355 nm irradiation of a @xmath87-h@xmath8 matrix containing methyl nitrite ( ch@xmath0ono ) at 3.2 k is rapidly converted into ch@xmath8oh .",
    "these authors theoretically predict that the conversion of ch@xmath0o to ch@xmath8oh on grain surfaces may occur in two steps : @xmath88 @xmath89 in light of these results , the formation of ch@xmath0o through grain - surface processes seems to be disfavoured , although more laboratory experiments and/or quantum chemistry calculations are needed to draw definitive conclusions .",

    "the first column of the table indicates whether or not the model includes grain surface production of ch@xmath0o radicals and the second column provides the density of h nuclei adopted in each model .",
    "as can be seen in the third column , the rate coefficient @xmath11(10 k ) used in previous models , either @xmath14",
    "@xmath3 molecule@xmath4 s@xmath4 ( measured by @xcite at 63 k ) or @xmath15 @xmath3 molecule@xmath4 s@xmath4 ( collision limit ) , differs by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "the fourth column gives the range of ch@xmath0o / ch@xmath0oh abundance ratios predicted by each model over a certain time interval , indicated in the fifth column .",
    "our results are consistent with those of @xcite when grain - surface production of ch@xmath0o is switched off in their model and reaction  ( [ reac:1 ] ) becomes the only efficient formation route to ch@xmath0o .",
    "the ch@xmath0o / ch@xmath0oh abundance ratios reported by @xcite are around or slightly above @xmath101 , while ours are around or slightly below @xmath101 .",
    "@xcite do only consider gas - phase formation of ch@xmath0o with @xmath11(10 k ) = @xmath15 @xmath3 molecule@xmath4 s@xmath4 and find a ch@xmath0o / ch@xmath0oh abundance ratio of @xmath102 , about 10 times higher than the value observed in b1-b , over a restricted time interval around @xmath82 yr .",
    "as seen in table  [ tab:3 ] , a common outcome of models that consider formation of ch@xmath0o on grain surfaces @xcite is a significant overestimation of the ch@xmath0o / ch@xmath0oh abundance ratio with respect to the observed value in b1-b .",
    "this fact points to an overestimation in the formation efficiency of ch@xmath0o through grain - surface routes , which is consistent with the empirical conclusion that ch@xmath0o is not predominantly formed on grains surfaces .",
    "it must be noted that the efficiency of the grain - surface processes invoked to explain the formation of ch@xmath0o is highly uncertain .    in the chemical models of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "ch@xmath0o is assumed to be formed mainly on the surface of dust grains through successive hydrogenations of co. methoxy radicals are assumed to be further ejected to the gas phase through chemical desorption , which assumes that a fraction , typically @xmath103 , of the energy released by exothermic chemical reactions on grain surfaces is used by the products to desorb . in the chemical model of @xcite , ch@xmath0o is also formed through a mechanism involving the formation of van der waals complexes between carbon atoms colliding with dust grains and water ice molecules . in these two chemical models ,",
    "the formation of ch@xmath0o through the gas - phase reaction of oh and ch@xmath0oh was included although grain - surface processes are found to dominate the formation of ch@xmath0o .",
    "the gas - phase production rate of ch@xmath0o is similar in both models , although the depletion of ch@xmath0o through reactions with h and o atoms is assumed to be faster in the model of @xcite .",
    "this makes that , as seen in table  [ tab:3 ] , the values of @xmath81(ch@xmath0o)/@xmath81(ch@xmath0oh ) predicted by @xcite are higher than those calculated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite modelled the fractional abundance of ch@xmath0o using an updated gas - grain chemical model that included the gas - phase reaction of oh with methanol ( reaction  [ reac:1 ] ) and with some other organic molecules .",
    "these authors run the model with and without reaction  ( [ reac:1 ] ) and concluded that at 10 k this reaction is not generally an effective destruction route for ch@xmath0oh , although it leads to an increase in the abundance of ch@xmath0o at times longer than @xmath104 yr .",
    "the main competing process of formation of gas - phase ch@xmath0o in this model is the hydrogenation of formaldehyde on grain surfaces followed by non - thermal desorption .",
    "clearly , in this model the ch@xmath0o / ch@xmath0oh abundance ratio is largely overestimated with respect to the observed value in b1-b , probably as a consequence of a too efficient formation of ch@xmath0o via grain - surface routes .",
    "in this work , we have determined the rate coefficient @xmath11 for the gas - phase reaction between oh radicals and ch@xmath0oh in the range of temperatures between 22 and 64 k. this study provides the first measurement of @xmath11 at temperatures below 56 k. the lowest temperature investigated here , 22 k , is the closest one to that in b1-b at which the rate coefficient of the reaction between oh and ch@xmath0oh has been measured . in the cold environment of b1-b , ch@xmath0o ( product of the reaction between oh and ch@xmath0oh ) has been detected recently .",
    "the consistency of the measured rate coefficients in two different laboratories ( uclm and ur1 ) leads us confidence in the reported @xmath34 , especially around 60 k where there is some discrepancy with previous data .",
    "we fit the measured rate coefficients as a function of temperature and provide an expression of @xmath34 in the temperature range 22 - 64 k. further measurements of @xmath11 at temperatures below 22 k are needed to corroborate whether this reaction continues to be accelerated at even lower temperatures and to constrain by how much in order to better evaluate its contribution to the production of ch@xmath0o in cold dense clouds such as b1-b .",
    "in addition , there is still a gap to fill between 64 and 123 k , which is planned to be covered in the near future with new laval nozzles that will help to elucidate the kinetic behaviour at intermediate temperatures .",
    "finally , we will intend to detect ch@xmath0o radicals formed in the reaction of oh with methanol at 22 k by lif .",
    "this is planned to be done in the near future , since some changes are needed in the experimental system to detect ch@xmath0o .",
    "we have also modeled the chemistry of ch@xmath0o in cold dense clouds considering that it is only formed through the gas - phase reaction of oh and ch@xmath0oh .",
    "we have adopted the extrapolated value of @xmath34 at 10 k and assumed that gas - phase reactions with h and o atoms are the only removal processes of ch@xmath0o . this model predicts ch@xmath0o",
    "/ ch@xmath0oh abundance ratios that are similar or slightly below the value observed in b1-b ( @xmath5 ) , confirming that the reaction of oh and ch@xmath0oh is clearly involved in the formation of interstellar methoxy radicals .",
    "this is consistent with recent experiments that indicate that ch@xmath8oh , rather than ch@xmath0o , is the isomer formed on icy grain mantles .",
    "nonetheless , the role of grain - surface processes on the chemistry of ch@xmath0o needs to be further investigated .",
    "probably a search for the more stable isomer , ch@xmath8oh , in cold dense clouds may shed light on the relative role of gas - phase and grain - surface chemical reactions in the synthesis of methanol - derived radicals .",
    "up to date , the rotational spectrum of ch@xmath8oh has not been yet accurately measured in the laboratory , which complicates the detection in the interstellar medium .",
