    "how do electrons cross a direct interface between a normal and a superconducting metal ? at a tunnel junction the superconducting gap suppresses electron transport at small energies around the fermi level . at a direct contact with no or only a very weak tunneling barrier , andreev reflection transfers an additional electron for each incident one to form a cooper pair in the superconductor . in an alternative picture",
    "the cooper pair is composed of the incident electron plus a newly created one by emitting a hole . because of energy and momentum conservation this hole travels back through the contact and into the normal conductor along almost the same path taken by the incident electron .",
    "normal reflection as the natural counter part of andreev reflection enhances the interface resistance , normal reflection of the second electron or the retro - reflected hole creates the characteristic double - minimum structure of the andreev - reflection resistance spectra .",
    "while the role of andreev reflection in the transport process across the interface is understood @xcite , the normal - reflection part is far from being settled .",
    "normal reflection at a metal interface reduces its transmission coefficient @xmath0 to below unity .",
    "the dimensionless @xmath1 parameter represents the strength of a @xmath2 - function tunneling barrier that approximates a more realistic rectangular barrier of finite height @xmath3 and width @xmath4 according to @xmath5 for electrons with ( average ) fermi velocity @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "two other mechanisms contribute to normal - reflection .",
    "first , fermi surface mismatch , again in terms of a @xmath2 - function barrier , adds @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ratio of fermi velocities of the two electrodes @xcite .",
    "second , diffusive transport through the contact region , conserves electron and hole energies in elastic scattering processes , but not their momentum .",
    "this allows partial backscattering of the incident electron as well as the second electron or the retro - reflected hole .",
    "a diffusive contact is thought to consist of a certain number of modes , each mode @xmath9 has its own transmission coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "an ideal long diffusive junction has a distribution of transmission coefficients which sums up to a single @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "real contacts could have any combination of those three mechanisms . unless one of them dominates , separating the different contributions requires that they do not depend on each other , for example when the tunneling barrier sits at the end of the diffusive channel , or on one side of the interface and not on the other , with the total @xmath12 .",
    "real contacts are probably more intricate than described by a @xmath2 - function barrier @xcite . however , before invoking more involved and speculative modelling , one should try to explain the experimental data by starting with the most basic mechanisms mentioned above .",
    "naidyuk _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite as well as naidyuk and yanson @xcite have noticed that s ( superconducting ) - n ( normal ) point contacts , including those with unconventional heavy - fermion and high - temperature superconductors , often have @xmath1 parameters between 0.4 and 0.5 , and that those contacts could be in the diffusive limit . during the last couple of years we have found similar @xmath13 values for many s - n combinations over a wide range of contact resistances or lateral contact sizes that can not be explained by a dielectric barrier @xcite . since point - contacts between conventional metals and heavy - fermion compounds with up to two orders of magnitude smaller @xmath6 also have @xmath14 @xcite , fermi - velocity mismatch does not seem to be a valid approach .",
    "that is why our initial interpretation of point - contact experiments with superconducting niobium and conventional metals @xcite , which we will revise here , was based on the mismatch of fermi momentum .",
    "additionally , niobium provides such a wide margin of possible fermi wave numbers from less than @xmath15nm@xmath16 up to @xmath17nm@xmath16 that one can almost freely pick a suitable one @xcite .",
    "we show here by comparing andreev - reflection data of contacts between elemental superconductors and non - magnetic normal metals that fermi - surface mismatch is not the dominant mechanism of normal reflection .",
    "moreover , we suggest that even theoretically fermi - surface mismatch does not affect normal reflection of the andreev - reflected holes .",
    "we fabricated the point - contact interfaces using the shear ( crossed wire ) method by moving the two sample wires towards each other until they touch at one spot @xcite .",
    "before the contact is set , the wires slide against each other and , thus , either remove or break up possible remains of an oxide layer , improving the chance that the contacts are formed between relatively clean surfaces .",
    "the normal conductors were silver ( ag ) , gold ( au ) , copper ( cu ) , palladium ( pd ) , and platinum ( pt ) , and the superconductors aluminum ( al , @xmath18k ) , cadmium ( cd , 0.56 k ) , indium ( in , 3.4 k ) , niobium ( nb , 9.2 k ) , tantalum ( ta , 4.4 k ) , tin ( sn , 3.7 k ) , titanium ( ti , 0.5 k ) , and zinc ( zn , 0.87 k ) . the wires had a diameter of @xmath19 mm except al ( 0.5 mm ) , cd ( 1.0 mm ) , and in ( 1.5 mm ) .",
    "surface treatment did not noticeably affect the spectra with two exceptions that had otherwise enhanced @xmath1 values or stronger normal reflection .",
    "the oxide layer of nb was removed using fine abrasive paper , and that of zn by dipping the wire in dilute hcl acid . before installing and cooling down ,",
    "the wires were cleaned in an ethanol ultrasound bath .    :",

    "the arrow marks the temperature above which @xmath1 was kept constant.,width=321 ]    the contacts were measured in the vacuum region of a dilution refrigerator .",
    "a dc current @xmath24 with a small superposed ac component @xmath25 ran through the contact , and the voltage drop @xmath26 across the contact was measured to obtain the @xmath27 characteristics as well as the differential resistance spectrum @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to s - n contacts we have also investigated s@xmath29 - s@xmath30 junctions between two different superconductors @xmath31 and @xmath32 that had critical temperatures @xmath33 , for example nb - al or in - zn , above @xmath34 to drive superconductor @xmath32 normal while @xmath31 still remains superconducting .",
    "strong superconductors @xmath31 = in , ta , and nb needed temperatures well above @xmath34 to suppress proximity - induced superconductivity in @xmath32 .",
    "the spectra were fitted using the modified btk theory @xcite that includes dynes lifetime parameter @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this model contains only two other adjustable parameters , the energy gap @xmath20 and the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "the differential resistance at large bias voltages coincided with the normal contact resistance @xmath35 .",
    "not all contacts revealed the typical andreev - like spectra that could be easily analysed , but had additional anomalies .",
    "find examples for the distribution between good and bad contacts in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure [ spectra ] shows representative spectra of a zn - ag contact as function of temperature together with the fit parameters .",
    "the energy gap @xmath36 follows closely the theoretical bcs curve @xcite , while @xmath37 and @xmath38 barely depend on temperature .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter could be determined within @xmath39 when the andreev - reflection double - minimum structure is visible .",
    "near @xmath40 we kept @xmath1 constant and adjusted only @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "figures [ z - in - zn ] - [ z - ag - ti ] show the @xmath1 parameters as function of contact resistance @xmath35 for various s - n combinations .",
    "note that in many cases from small resistances of less than @xmath41 ( contact diameter @xmath42 nm ) to above @xmath43 ( contact diameter @xmath44 nm ) the @xmath1 parameter stays rather constant at around 0.5 . at higher resistances above @xmath43 the contacts typically had larger @xmath1 values , probably because small interface areas are more susceptible to the surface quality .",
    "also the cleaning mechanism of the shear contacts does not seem to work well with a soft counter electrode like in as shown in figure [ z - in - zn ] c ) where some of the in - zn contacts had large @xmath1 already at small @xmath35 .",
    "some of the al contacts in figure [ z - al - au ] had @xmath1 down to 0.3 in the @xmath45 range @xcite .",
    "since this was accompanied by enhanced @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we suspect that those small @xmath1 values could be artefacts caused by inhomogeneous superconductivity in the contact region .",

    "the ti - ag data scatter over more than twice this width.,width=321 ]",
    "our main experimental results in figures [ z - in - zn ] - [ z - ag - ti ] confirm earlier observations that s - n contacts have rather similar @xmath1 parameters around 0.5 @xcite .",
    "explanations based on a dielectric tunneling barrier , fermi - surface mismatch , or diffusive contacts , have to reproduce the very small variation of @xmath1",
    ".    the question of a dielectric interface barrier can be resolved most easily .",
    "such a barrier , or its remnants , could be present because we have prepared the contacts at ambient conditions .",
    "however , if tunneling would be the dominant mechanism one would expect a much larger variation of @xmath1 not only from metal - to - metal combination but also from contact to contact @xcite .",
    "the experimental data in figures [ z - in - zn ] - [ z - ag - ti ] demonstrate the opposite , therefore @xmath51 for contacts with @xmath52 .",
    "we can not exclude that tunneling plays a role for some of the in - zn and ti - ag contacts which , nevertheless , agree with the lower bound of @xmath14 .",
    "the second reflection mechanism , fermi - surface mismatch , can also not explain the small variation of the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "each time we make a new contact , the orientation of the crystallites that form the interface changes , and the @xmath1 parameter should change accordingly . since this is not observed",
    ", one should expect that @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "a second argument against fermi - surface mismatch comes from the magnitude of @xmath1 for inter - related pairs of metals .",
    "take for example zn - ag and zn - cu contacts .",
    "they both have nearly the same @xmath54 , that means the fermi velocity of ag and cu would be either 2.39 or 1/2.39 = 0.42 times that of zn , using @xmath55 . from ref . @xcite we get fermi - velocity ratios of 1.16 for the zn / ag and and 1.32 for the zn / cu pair , respectively .",
    "these two sets of data do not agree well with each other .",
    "the fact that ag in contact with other superconductors and those superconductors in contact with other normal metals have rather similar @xmath13 would imply the existence of just two groups of superconductors that have @xmath56 and @xmath57 as well as three groups of normal metals with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 as indicated schematically in figure [ triangles ] a ) .",
    "however , we have not found any s - n combination with @xmath61 ( velocity ratio @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) .",
    "therefore , all normal metals would have fermi velocities near that of ag , while all superconductors have either @xmath64 or @xmath65 with respect to ag",
    ". this does not seem plausible .",
    "consider other combinations between one normal and two superconductors like the ag , in , and zn triple .",
    "for in / ag we get from ref .",
    "@xcite a velocity ratio of 1.25 .",
    "but now we can also measure normal zn in contact with superconducting in .",
    "they have the same @xmath66 .",
    "again use ag as reference in figure [ triangles ] c ) . according to the first two experiments on zn - ag and in - ag contacts , zn and in should have fermi velocities of either 2.39 or 0.42 times that of ag .",
    "the third experiment with in - zn contacts indicates that zn should have a fermi velocity of 2.39 or 0.42 times that of in , that is @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or @xmath69 times that of ag .",
    "this contradicts the in - ag data even if we allow for an uncertainty of @xmath70 .",
    "one can construct similar patterns also for other inter - related metal combinations , like for the ag , al , and nb triple in figure [ triangles ] c ) . thus fermi surface mismatch in its common form @xcite can not account for the observed @xmath1 parameters .",
    "( thick horizontal bars ) normalized with respect to that of ag .",
    "a ) fermi - surface mismatch only causes all superconductors ( s ) to fall into two categories with @xmath56 or @xmath57 , assuming an average @xmath71 . in turn",
    "all normal metals ( n ) either have @xmath72 , @xmath73 , or @xmath74 .",
    "b ) fermi velocities of in and zn derived from in - ag and zn - ag contacts as well as that of zn calculated from in - zn junctions .",
    "the shaded areas indicate error margins of @xmath75 .",
    "the two ways to derive @xmath76 of zn clearly do not match .",
    "c ) likewise the fermi velocities of al and nb are derived from al - ag and nb - ag contacts , then the velocity of nb is calculated from nb - al contacts.,width=321 ]    how good is the free electron model for andreev - reflection spectroscopy ? it assumes a spherical fermi surface and one , two , or three conduction electrons per atom .",
    "it describes reasonably well the alkali metals ( which we do not use here ) but not the transition metals like nb and ta or the nobel metals pd and pd that have rather complex fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "since electrons from different parts of the fermi surface contribute to charge transport , it should be rather difficult to identify a specific fermi velocity in those cases .",
    ".bloch - grneisen parameters of the various metals .",
    "@xmath77 is the electrical resistivity at @xmath78k , @xmath79 the debye temperature , @xmath80 the molar mass , and @xmath81 the sommerfeld constant of the electronic specific heat .",
    "these data have been collected from @xcite .",
    "@xmath82 is the bloch - grneisen derived velocity eq .",
    "[ v_bg ] and @xmath6 the free - electron fermi velocity @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     point - contact spectroscopy uses electrical transport properties as information source .",
    "therefore it appears natural to extract an average fermi velocity from the bloch - grneisen law for the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity @xcite . at high temperatures the resistivity @xmath83 varies linearly with temperature , and does not depend on impurities .",
    "the proportionality factor contains the fermi velocity , the size of the fermi surface of the conduction electrons , the surface area of the debye sphere , and the strength of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "one can write @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath81 is the sommerfeld constant of the electronic specific heat , @xmath79 the debye temperature , @xmath80 the molar mass , and @xmath85 a length scale that depends on the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "although the bloch - grneisen law describes relative changes of the resistivity quite well @xcite , it is not commonly used to extract absolute values .",
    "however , for our purposes we need only ratios of fermi velocities , and can get rid of the less well known @xmath85 s by assuming they are roughly the same for all metals , defining @xmath86 to use instead of the fermi velocity .",
    "table [ bg - parameters ] summarizes the parameters which allow to calculate @xmath82 and thus the velocity ratios @xmath87 for all investigated metal combinations .",
    "we refrain from estimating error margins or how well @xmath82 maps the true @xmath6 and consider it as a number that characterizes the fermi surface .",
    "note that @xmath82 does not vary much for those metals which have a free - electron @xmath6 given in ref .",
    "@xcite except for ti .",
    "@xmath82 is large for metals with a nearly spherical fermi surface , but small for all others .",
    "a rather small @xmath6 of ti has been noted by zhang dianlin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and hao zhu _",
    "also nb is claimed to have a small fermi velocity @xcite .",
    "parameters of contacts between a ) al and other metals m and b ) superconductors s and ag as function of their velocity ratio @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the thin solid line describes the expected @xmath1 due to fermi surface mismatch @xcite , the thick solid is a guide to the eye using @xmath90.,width=321 ]    figure [ z_of_r_bg ] compares theory and experiment .",
    "it demonstrates that the @xmath1 parameter depends only weakly on the velocity ratio , and that there is a huge background .",
    "therefore another mechanism must be responsible for the main contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "assume an independent one represented by @xmath91 and write @xmath92 with a weight factor @xmath93 .",
    "the data in figure [ z_of_r_bg ] indicate @xmath94 so that one can not reliably separate fermi - surface mismatch even if it would exist .    in summary , all three arguments , _",
    "i ) _ the little variation of @xmath1 from contact to contact , _ ii ) _ the non - matching inter - related pairs of s - n junctions , as well as _",
    "iii ) _ the small variation of @xmath1 with the velocity ratio @xmath95 take the same line that fermi - surface mismatch is not the dominant normal reflection mechanism .",
    "note that arguments _",
    "i ) _ and _ ii ) _ apply not only to the velocity mismatch but also to the case of the momentum mismatch .",
    "this leaves the third reflection mechanism .",
    "diffusive contacts have @xmath96 in the ideal case of a long channel @xcite .",
    "thus diffusion would conveniently explain our results , especially the large background @xmath91 .",
    "however , a more realistic short instead of long diffusive channel or a strongly disordered interface should lead to different @xmath1 values .",
    "we will investigate this possibility elsewhere .",
    "why is fermi - surface mismatch absent , or at least strongle suppressed ?",
    "electrons as well as andreev - reflected holes travel through a dielectric tunneling barrier with a certain probability .",
    "those not transmitted are reflected and enhance the contact resistance .",
    "the retro - reflected holes that move towards the dielectric barrier can tunnel through with the same probability as the incident electrons .",
    "this produces the typical andreev reflection double - minimum structure of the resistance spectra from which one can extract @xmath1 .",
    "the same applies to diffusive processes .",
    "however , fermi - surface mismatch works differently because it allows electrons that have corresponding states on the other side to cross the interface and bars all others .",
    "that means the transmission probability is either 1 or 0 .",
    "a retro - reflected hole is not affected again by fermi - surface mismatch because it has already the right properties to find a corresponding state on the other side .",
    "thus fermi - surface mismatch affects the absolute value of the contact resistance but not the shape of the andreev - reflection spectra .",
    "fermi - surface mismatch might play some role in the case of spin - polarized normal metals because there the two spin species have different fermi surfaces , and the retro - reflected holes flying back to the contact can face conditions that differ from that of the incident electrons .",
    "we have found that fermi - surface mismatch barely affects the normal - reflection part of andreev reflection .",
    "this makes andreev - reflection spectroscopy unsuitable for measuring relative fermi velocities of the electrodes , and leaves diffusive transport through the contact , that is elastic scattering at or near the contact interface , as the most probable mechanism to explain the usually observed double - minimum andreev - reflection anomalies .",
