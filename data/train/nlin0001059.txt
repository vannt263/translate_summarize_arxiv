    "stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) is a 3-wave interaction process with extremely wide application in physics , especially in nonlinear optics @xcite@xcite .",
    "this essentially nonlinear phenomenon couples two electromagnetic waves ( pump and stokes waves ) to a two - level medium and is described by a simple system of partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "such a system applies to different physical situations , depending on a phenomenological damping factor chosen to match the observed raman linewidth .",
    "for instance , the steady state regime occurs when one neglects dynamical effects on the medium .",
    "then the system becomes explicitly solvable in terms of the intensities and the result fits well the situation of strong damping and long pulses , such as in fiber guides @xcite .",
    "when instead dynamical effects and damping are of same order , very interesting phase effects have been discovered in @xcite .",
    "these have been interpreted as the manifestation of solitons which , in the spectral transform scheme , would be related to discrete eigenvalues .",
    "instead they are related to the continuous spectrum ( they are not solitons ) and named _ raman spikes _ @xcite .",
    "therefore the question of the observation of the raman soliton is open since the original work @xcite in 1975 .",
    "when the damping term is much smaller than the dynamical response of the medium , and can be neglected the regime is called hyper - transient and applies to short duration pulses . here",
    "the system possesses a lax pair @xcite and can be treated by means of the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) generalized to boundary - value problems @xcite .",
    "the observation of the raman soliton is an interesting open problem , especially since the boundary - value problem for tsrs has been completely solved on the finite interval in @xcite with the essential result that , as expected from the works @xcite , the field @xmath0 universally evolves toward the self - similar solution .",
    "the commonly used tsrs model is obtained as a 3-wave interaction process where the group velocities of the 3 fields involved are considered equal .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this assumption is an asymptotic limit and consequently the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) has to be taken into account ( through the spectral extension of the input laser fields ) , leading to a modified srs system ( eq .",
    "the main consequence of this fact is that raman solitons ( discrete eigenvalues in the nonlinear fourier spectrum ) are effectively generated by srs in the medium @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that raman solitons are indeed created in a finite length medium and that their generation is accompanied with poles in the nonlinear fourier spectrum ( spectral transform ) .",
    "we follow the model derived and solved in @xcite and establish the following results .    1 - based on the assumption of a semi - infinite medium",
    ", ist gives an explicit solution which will be shown to be an excellent approximation of the finite medium case .",
    "we explain this from the fast decay of the _ potential _ @xmath0 for large @xmath1 .",
    "such is not the case in the zero - gvd case for which @xmath0 decreases as @xmath2 typical of the self - similar solution @xcite .    2",
    "- the reflection coefficient @xmath3 of the spectral transform ( or nonlinear fourier spectrum ) is expressed in terms of the input and output field envelopes , allowing us to check the appearance of raman solitons ( the real valued single poles of @xmath3 ) on the numerical solutions .",
    "this also provides a means to observe the generation of raman solitons in experimental data .    3 - a recursion formula for computing the spectral transform of a finite set of data has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "we have implemented this _ discrete spectral transform _ and confirmed the creation of these raman solitons in a simulation on a finite length .",
    "a remarkable feature here is that the numerical spectral transform can be quite easily implemented , its computation is faster , and it provides more information than a conventional fourier transform .    after presenting the model in section 2 ,",
    "we report the numerical observation of the raman solitons in section 3 .",
    "section 4 explains this by an analysis of the medium dynamical variable .",
    "we present here the extension of the srs model of @xcite to the case where the dispersion of the group velocity is not neglected . we consider the classical model as in @xcite , well adapted to molecular raman scattering , and for which the medium is schematically represented by a collection @xmath4 of harmonic oscillators coupled to the electric field @xmath5 through the polarizability of the medium .",
    "when the polarizability depends on the frequency of the applied field , the group velocity of the electromagnetic waves becomes frequency dependent .",
    "while a very small group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) has no consequence on the evolution of the amplitude , it has nontrivial effects on the phase dynamics . in this context",
    ", it has been proved in @xcite , using _ multiscale analysis _ , that for the electric field @xmath6 and medium dynamical variable @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the resulting model of transient srs can be written in the _ retarded time _",
    "@xmath11 where the overbar stands everywhere for the complex conjugate .",
    "note the conservation ( @xmath1-independence ) of the flux density @xmath12 .",
    "the above model differs from the usual srs system , corresponding to the zero gvd case @xmath13 by the presence of the integral over all possible realizations of the phase mismatch @xmath14 .",
    "the question of interest is the time evolution of a couple @xmath15 of pump and stokes pulses of time duration @xmath16 sent into a medium of length @xmath17 .",
    "hence the domain of integration is @xmath18\\ , \\quad t\\in[0,t]\\ .\\ ] ] and it is necessary to prescribe the values of the fields on the two boundaries @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the medium is initially ( @xmath19 ) at rest ( all molecules in the fundamental state ) , hence the initial datum for the field @xmath21 is @xmath22 independently of the reference frame .",
    "given at _ physical time _",
    "zero , that is on the characteristic @xmath23 . ]",
    "the input ( @xmath20 ) light pulses are arbitrary functions of time @xmath24 with a given spectral distribution around @xmath25 , namely @xmath26 we shall be working here with the representative example treated in @xcite which consists in assuming a common spectral lineshape for @xmath27 and @xmath28 as a normalized lorentzian lineshape for the intensities .",
    "more precisely we set @xmath29 and @xmath30 are arbitrary .",
    "it is useful also to understand the scale invariance of the srs system , including its boundary values . by a simple change of variables",
    "it can be easily shown that the system ( characterized by the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath17 ) _ together with _ the input boundary values ( characterized by the parameter @xmath32 ) bears the scale invariance @xmath33 this invariance has been checked on numerical simulations as one way to test the code accuracy , and it works so well that we have obtained indiscernible pictures .",
    "we describe hereafter the ist solution of the boundary - value problem for the system using the results of @xcite , and compare it with the direct numerical solution in the finite length case .",
    "the direct problem consists in defining the spectral transform from the data of the _ potential _ @xmath0 and the boundary values @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( as time @xmath24 appears everywhere as an external parameter , we shall forget it here ) .",
    "this is done by defining the following jost solutions ( for @xmath36 ) @xmath37 which are both entire functions of @xmath14 vanishing as @xmath38 in the upper half - plane .",
    ", @xmath39    these two functions then allow to define the _ reflection coefficient _ @xmath40 and the _ transmission coefficient _ @xmath41 by taking the limit @xmath42 of @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 , namely @xmath46 the coefficient @xmath47 is clearly an entire function of @xmath14 and one can show @xcite that the reflection coefficient @xmath40 is meromorphic in the upper half - plane with a finite number of single poles related to the solitonic part of the solution @xmath21 .",
    "we have also the following _ unitarity _ relation for @xmath36 @xmath48 and @xmath49 solve the same differential equation as the vector @xmath50 in .",
    "then by comparing their values in @xmath20 we readily obtain from @xmath51      from , and , the output @xmath52 is explicitly given for @xmath53 by the expression @xmath54 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the input data defined in .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that the function @xmath55 is obtained by solving the following riccati time evolution @xmath56 - 2\\rho\\ { \\cal c}_k^+[\\phi]- { \\cal c}_k^+[m]\\ , \\quad \\rho(k,0)=0\\ , \\ ] ] where the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given from the input data by @xmath59 and where @xmath60 denote the following cauchy integral @xmath61=\\frac1\\pi\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\frac{d\\zeta}{\\zeta-(k+i0)}\\ f(\\zeta)\\ .\\ ] ] consequently , for given inputs @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the expression gives the explicit asymptotic output pump intensity from the solution of the evolution .",
    "it is worth remarking that , at any given time , @xmath3 possesses possibly a finite number of simple poles whose time evolution is given by the nonlinearity of the riccati equation .    for practical purpose ,",
    "we choose in the stokes wave input seed as a portion @xmath62 of the pump wave , namely @xmath63 in that case the evolution can be explicitly solved @xcite @xmath64 @xmath65      our purpose is to understand how the above ist - solution can be used to model the solution of the srs system on a finite length .",
    "this can be done first in a qualitative way by writing the solution of with boundary values as the equivalent integral form @xmath66 the output @xmath67 will not differ much from its asymptotic value @xmath68 if @xmath0 is sufficiently small for @xmath69 .",
    "consequently the behavior of @xmath0 at large @xmath1 , is essential for the adequation of the formula to real situations .",
    "we will see in the next section that it is also crucial for the applicability of the spectral method .",
    "we now proceed to show that the numerical solution of the tsrs system on a finite interval is in excellent agreement with the theoretical expression for the output .",
    "we discretized in both @xmath1 and @xmath24 using an order 2 runge - kutta method and advance via the following algorithm : + 1 - given @xmath70 and @xmath71 for all real k , compute @xmath0 by integrating the time - evolution of @xmath21 at @xmath1 for the initial datum @xmath72 , where the integral is calculated using the trapezoidal rule , + 2 - advance to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , for all @xmath14 , by integrating the differential equation for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , + 3 - go to step 1 with @xmath77 .",
    "+ the scheme is started at step 1 for @xmath20 .",
    "the quality of the computation is monitored by evaluating the relative error in the total flux @xmath78 which is conserved by . in all the runs that are presented it remained smaller than @xmath79 .",
    "we chose as parameters @xmath80 and the input pump pulse envelope is the gaussian @xmath81\\ .\\ ] ] for this choice we found that @xmath82 and @xmath83 gave stable results .",
    "another point is that because of the lorentzian line width we had to take a @xmath14 interval of width @xmath84 in order to ensure that the integrals were normalized . to describe the strong oscillations present for the zero gvd system we had to chose @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "a typical run with number of grid points in @xmath87 and @xmath14 @xmath88 takes about 2 hours cpu monoprocessor on a rs10000 .",
    "we used the parallelism of the problem , i.e. the fact that the marching in @xmath1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath24 ) can be made in parallel for the loops in @xmath24 and @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1 ) and implemented the code on a silicon graphics sgi 10000 using the openmp software .",
    "this enabled a gain of a factor 8 or 10 in computing time depending on the number of processors used .",
    "figure [ f01 ] show the pump intensity input @xmath89 and output @xmath52 computed from the ist expression together with the numerical solution of the system for a length @xmath90 and four different values of the parameter @xmath14 , in excellent agreement ( a tiny discrepancy is only seen in the last picture ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that one can not pursue a given numerical experiment to a longer length arbitrarily .",
    "we have stopped for instance the above calculation at length @xmath90 where the potential @xmath91 . continuing",
    "the run to longer lengths would yield an increase of the potential which would then start to oscillate .",
    "this is probably due to the system itself which amplifies the numerical errors in a drastic way at long lengths ( note that from the scale invariance longer length means larger raman amplification ) .",
    "the function @xmath3 of has an essential singularity in @xmath92 and a set of single poles @xmath93 evolving in time , given by @xmath94 for @xmath95 . at time zero",
    "no pole is present and , as @xmath24 evolves , poles move upward from @xmath96 and eventually reach the real axis at the times @xmath97 defined by @xmath98 , i.e. by the implicit expression @xmath99 ^ 2]\\ .\\ ] ] note that @xmath100 , hence the poles cross the real axis by pair .",
    "the corresponding positions on the real axis are then given by @xmath101 we plot in figure [ f02 ] the imaginary part of the poles @xmath102 as a function of time for the parameter values ( [ param ] ) and @xmath103 and 3 .",
    "we observe that the first three poles cross the real axis at the positions @xmath104 and times @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the pole @xmath107 starts to evolve with @xmath24 but can not cross the real axis because of the finite duration of the pump pulse .",
    "as soon as these poles move to the upper half - plane , they generate a soliton component in the _ `` potential '' _ @xmath0 .",
    "we will prove in the next section that this potential ( the medium dynamical variable ) is a continuous function of @xmath24 when a pole crosses the real axis .",
    "the expressions can be inverted to get the following expressions of the jost solutions in terms of the ( physical ) fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 and of the input pulses @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath108 then the definitions lead to the following formula @xmath109 which gives the spectral transform @xmath55 in terms of the output pump and stokes fields .",
    "this function for @xmath14 real must become singular at the two points @xmath110 each time a soliton @xmath93 is created and it is used now to prove the generation of raman solitons in numerical experiments .    for the input pulses given in and the particular choice , we readily obtain from the above @xmath111 we use this expression to estimate @xmath112 from the numerical solution @xmath15 at @xmath113 and compare it to the @xmath3 obtained from the ist ( [ rho - sol-1 ] ) for the parameters ( [ param ] ) .",

    "both expressions are very close and as expected @xmath119 is singular for @xmath120 for @xmath121 , while it is regular for @xmath122 . in the first picture of figure [ f03 ]",
    ", the dashed line actually represents the value at @xmath25 instead of @xmath123 .",
    "this is the only noticable discrepancy between analytic asymptotic formula and numerical / experimental expression , resulting from the finiteness in @xmath1 of the data @xmath124 ( the wave length @xmath125 ) .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the finite length solution is in good agreement with the asymptotic behavior ( [ pump - out - infty ] ) given by the ist on the semi - infinite line .",
    "we now proceed to justify this fact by analyzing the behavior of the medium dynamical variable @xmath0 .",
    "ist furnishes the solution @xmath0 , called _ medium dynamical variable _ , by the expression @xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the coefficient of @xmath128 in the laurent expansion of the function @xmath129 solution of the following cauchy - green coupled system @xmath130 here @xmath131 are the @xmath132 residues of @xmath55 at the poles @xmath102 that are in the upper half @xmath14-plane ( if any ) .",
    "note that the solution @xmath43 corresponds to the solution of and that @xmath133 .",
    "apparently the generation of a soliton is followed by the adjunction of a term in the equation for @xmath134 , and consequently also in the expression of @xmath21 , leading to a possible discontinuity for @xmath21 .",
    "we will now proceed to show that this is not the case .",
    "this situation is particular to the spectral problem on the semi - line where the continuous spectrum ( value of @xmath40 on the real axis ) is not separable from the discrete spectrum ( poles of @xmath3 in the upper half complex plane ) .",
    "this is due to the motion of the poles of @xmath3 that can cross the real axis . on the contrary , in the full line case",
    ", solitons ( discrete spectrum ) can exist without radiation ( continuous spectrum ) .      from now on when the spectral parameter @xmath14 is generically complex we shall be using boldface letter @xmath135 from what precedes , at @xmath136",
    "a pole crosses the real axis at @xmath137 from the lower half plane .",
    "we consider here the limits @xmath138 and we write for @xmath36 @xmath139 where @xmath140 is analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath141 .",
    "note that @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the residue of @xmath3 at the pole @xmath137 .",
    "assuming for simplicity no other pole , we have from at @xmath144 @xmath145 which is well defined at @xmath137 since the distribution @xmath146 is meaningful .    on the contrary at @xmath147 ,",
    "expression diverges due to the distribution @xmath148 .",
    "since now there is a pole in the upper half complex plane , we should take the limit @xmath149 in the complete expression in .",
    "i.e. @xmath150 for @xmath151 .",
    "we obtain @xmath152 and consequently from ( [ qrebuild ] ) @xmath153      we consider here for simplicity the case when solitons are not yet present . then from and , @xmath21 can be reconstructed in terms of the reflection coefficient @xmath154 and the jost solution @xmath43 by means of @xmath155 this formula yields directly an information on the behavior of @xmath21 at large @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath156 @xmath157 , @xmath158 are continuous and tend to @xmath159 for @xmath160 , and if @xmath161 , we obtain by repeated integration by parts @xmath162 hence finally @xmath163    as mentioned in the introduction , such an asymptotic behavior is not found for the potential @xmath164 which would be obtained from tsrs with zero gvd .",

    "the exponential decay of @xmath170 can be seen for all values of @xmath24 and follows approximately @xmath173 as expected from the analysis .",
    "this observation justifies the fact that the finite length evolution of is very close to the asymptotic expression given by ist . + on the contrary the slow decay of @xmath171 as @xmath2 makes it impossible for the integrals of to exist so that the scattering theory must be revisited in this case .      by numerical integration of the srs system with a spatial grid of dimension @xmath169",
    ", we get , at each value of time , a set of @xmath174 discrete data @xmath175 ( with @xmath176 and @xmath177 ) , that we now analyze by means of the spectral transform .",
    "this is easily done , using the results of @xcite which , adapted to our notations , read @xmath178 where @xmath179 is obtained from the following inverse recursion @xmath180 and where the parameter @xmath181 is related to @xmath14 by @xmath182    it is then a simple task to use this recursion relation to compute the numerical spectral transform @xmath183 and compare it to the asymptotic theoretical expression of @xmath55 . in figure [ f05 ]",
    "we plot @xmath184 where one can clearly see the three singularities @xmath185 for @xmath103 corresponding to the three poles of @xmath3 .",
    "the non linear spectral transform is easier to compute , faster and yields more information than the standard fourier transform which in particular does not present any singularity ( as we checked numerically ) .",
    "this work demonstrates that the ist solution of transient srs on the semi - infinite line furnishes a very accurate model for the solution on a finite domain .",
    "the accuracy stands not only for the output laser pulses intensities but also for their phases as shown in a spectacular way by the generation of the raman solitons .",
    "it is shown that the question of the experimental observation of raman solitons is solved by a convenient combination of the output ( and input ) laser profiles .",
    "we also performed a numerical _ nonlinear spectral analysis _ which resulted to be not only rich of information but also quite easy to implement and faster than the usual fft procedure .",
    "finally we mention that it is difficult to compare these results with those obtained in the zero gvd case .",
    "the problem is that in the limit @xmath186 , the spectral transform gets an essential singularity in @xmath187 which sends poles to the upper half - plane . to discuss the number and time location of such poles",
    "would require not only a careful study of the singular limit @xmath186 , but also to reformulate ist on the half - line as we have seen that the potential @xmath124 does not decrease _ fast enough _ as @xmath42 .",
