    "empirical studies on real networks have revealed that many of them exhibit features that are not captured by the classical erds - rnyi graph . in particular , many networks tend to have a quite heavy tailed degree distribution , often described by a power law , that is , the fraction of vertices with degree @xmath13 decays as @xmath14 for some exponent @xmath15 . to capture this ,",
    "a number of new graph models have been developed that allow for this type of degree distribution ; see for instance the seminal paper by bollobs et al .",
    "@xcite ( the setup described there includes many previously studied models as special cases ) and the references therein .    a model type that has received a lot of attention is based on preferential attachment : new vertices are successively added to the network and are connected to existing vertices proportionally to a function @xmath16 of the degree .",
    "the mechanism was introduced in the context of network modeling by barabsi and albert @xcite , who observed that , for @xmath17 it seemed to lead to power law distributions with exponent @xmath18 for the degrees .",
    "this was proved rigorously in @xcite .",
    "krapivsky and redner @xcite later derived heuristic results indicating that the regimes @xmath19 and @xmath20 are qualitatively different : for @xmath20 the degree distribution is degenerate in the sense that there is a single dominant vertex that is connected to almost every other vertex .",
    "this was confirmed in @xcite .",
    "recently dereich and mrters @xcite has studied the degree evolution in the sublinear regime @xmath21 .    most preferential attachment models in the literature are defined in discrete time .",
    "rudas et al .",
    "@xcite however studies the model from a new perspective , embedding it in continuous time and interpreting it as a continuous time branching process .",
    "this opens up for the use of well established results from the theory of branching processes .",
    "compared to the traditional techniques for analyzing models with linear preferential attachment , the approach has the advantage that it applies for any @xmath19 .",
    "we mention also the paper by athreya et al .",
    "@xcite , where the linear case @xmath17 is studied by aid of a different type of branching process embedding .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to define and analyze a preferential attachment model embedded in continuous time where vertices are not just added but may also die , and where the death rate of a vertex is taken to be a function of its previous success , quantified by its accumulated degree . using results from the theory of general branching processes , a characterization of the asymptotic distribution of the accumulated degrees",
    "is derived and analyzed in various special cases .",
    "the momentaneous degrees are also discussed and analyzed by means of simulations .",
    "this generalizes results from @xcite . more specifically , the generalization compared to @xcite lies in that we work with a birth and death process instead of a pure birth process .",
    "we mention also the paper @xcite by britton and lindholm , where a model is treated that is similar in spirit but not based on preferential attachment .",
    "preferential attachment models incorporating deaths of vertices are much less studied than pure growth models , while real networks may well be affected by vertex emigration .",
    "existing rigorous results are restricted to the case when vertices die randomly , that is , the death mechanism does not depend on features of the vertices ( age , degree etc ) ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite for heuristic results , the latter concerning a situation where vertices die with a probability inversely proportional to their degree .",
    "concentration results are so far comparably weak , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.1 ) , and are lacking for models with more complicated death mechanisms .",
    "we now proceed to define the model .",
    "as already described , a vertex population evolving in continuous time is considered where existing vertices give birth to new vertices but may also die .",
    "more specifically , a vertex that is alive at time @xmath22 and that has given birth to @xmath23 new vertices during its life time , gives birth to an @xmath24:st vertex at rate @xmath25 , that is , the probability that the vertex gives birth in the time interval @xmath26 is @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , the vertex dies at rate @xmath28 , that is , its probability of dying during @xmath26 is @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a random point process on @xmath31 with points ( representing the births ) generated according to the above rules .",
    "starting from a single root vertex at time 0 , each vertex @xmath32 reproduces according to an independent copy @xmath33 of @xmath30 .",
    "this means that the vertex population evolves as a birth and death process in continuous time and hence fits into the framework of general branching processes ; see e.g.  jagers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .",
    "below we shall formulate conditions that guarantee that the process is supercritical , so that the vertex population indeed grows to infinity with positive probability .",
    "write @xmath34 for the set of vertices that are alive at time @xmath22 , and , for @xmath35 , let @xmath36 denote the total number of children that vertex @xmath32 has produced up to time @xmath22 ( including children that are no longer alive ) , also referred to as the _ fitness _ of the vertex .",
    "the time until the next birth in the population is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath37 and the time until the next death is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath38 .",
    "hence the probability that the next event that occurs in the population is a birth is given by @xmath39 and the probability that the birth occurs at vertex @xmath32 is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "we shall see later that , under certain assumption on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the ratio ( [ eq : bprop ] ) converges almost surely to a number in @xmath41 .",
    "the vertex population described above naturally gives rise to a network structure : directed edges are created between a vertex and its children , pointing from the child to the mother .",
    "when a vertex dies it turns into a _ ghost _ and all edges associated with",
    "it are turned into _",
    "ghost links_. according to the dynamics , the rate at which a vertex produces / attracts new vertices depends on its previous success , measured by its in - degree , including ghost links .",
    "weather or not it is realistic to include the ghost links depends on the setting . in many situations",
    "it is indeed natural to assume that the ability of a vertex to acquire new edges is affected by the total historical success of the vertex rather than just the contributions generated by vertices that are still present in the network ( think e.g.  of coauthor - ship networks , sexual networks , recruitment networks etc ) .",
    "a model where ghost links are excluded in the definition of the fitness can be analyzed by the same means as the present model .",
    "the calculations however become cumbersome and do not lead to explicit expressions .",
    "we elaborate on this and present simulation results in section 5 .",

    "recall that @xmath72 is the number of alive vertices at time @xmath22 and write @xmath73 for the number of alive vertices at time @xmath22 with fitness @xmath13 .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 we state the results we shall need from the theory of branching process and , in section 3 , proposition [ prop : rhohat ] and theorem [ th : dist ]",
    "are proved .",

    ", a formula is given for the the asymptotic degree distribution in a network where the birth and death rates are based on the momentaneous in - degrees rather than the fitnesses ( that is , the accumlated in - degrees ) .",
    "unfortunately this expression is hard to analyze , but simulation results are presented that indicate that the qualitative behaviour of the distribution is the same as for the fitnesses . finally , some possibilities for further work are mentioned in section 6 .",
    "the corpus of literature on branching processes is vast and we do not intend to give a survey ; for this , see jagers @xcite or the more expository book by haccou et al .",
    "we shall however briefly explain the concepts that are needed to establish theorem [ th : dist ] .",
    "these revolve around general branching processes counted with random characteristics . in a general branching process",

    "hence the space of possible individuals is @xmath84 write @xmath85 for the time when the individual @xmath32 is born , that is , @xmath86 and , if @xmath32 is the @xmath23:th child of the individual @xmath87 , then @xmath88 .",
    "roughly , when counting a branching processes with a random characteristic , a random score is assigned to each individual and the quantity of interest is then the total score in the population .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath89 be a real - valued stochastic process with @xmath90 for @xmath91 giving the score of an individual of age @xmath22 .",
    "the score of the individual @xmath32 at time @xmath22 is then given by @xmath92 and the total score in the population at time @xmath22 becomes @xmath93 examples of common characteristics are @xmath94 , in which case @xmath95 is the number of individuals born up to time @xmath22 , and @xmath96 , in which case @xmath95 is the number of individuals that are alive at time @xmath22  this quantity we shall use the notation @xmath72 for .",
    "these characteristics are both individual , meaning that @xmath33 depends only on the process of descendants of @xmath32 .",
    "characteristics that involve information also about preceding generations are called relational .",
    "an example of such a characteristic that we shall be interested in below is when an individual is assigned the value 1 if its mother is still alive and 0 otherwise .",
    "the laplace transform @xmath45 of the density @xmath42 of @xmath30 and the related quantity @xmath71 are defined as in ( [ eq : rhohat ] ) and ( [ eq : rhoinf ] ) .",
    "the solution @xmath97 to the equation @xmath98 is called the malthusian parameter and the process is subcritical , critical or supercritical depending on weather @xmath99 , @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",

    "these characteristics are both bounded , and hence , since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are assumed to be such that @xmath151 and @xmath152 are satisfied , all assumptions of theorem [ th : nerman ] are fulfilled .",

    "* first consider the case when @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath161 , that is , the birth rate is a linear function of the fitness and the vertices die at a constant rate .",

    "we get that @xmath170 the limiting behavior of the fitness distribution is hence unaffected by the vertex death .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the vertices die randomly , that is , given that the next thing to occur is a vertex death , the vertex to die is chosen uniformly at random , and such a mechanism does not affect the tail behavior of the power law distribution generated by the birth mechanism . with @xmath171",
    "the expression for @xmath172 is in agreement with previous results for pure linear preferential attachment .",
    "recall that , given the development of the process up to time @xmath22 , the probability that the next thing occurring is a vertex birth is given by ( [ eq : bprop ] ) , where @xmath36 is the fitness of vertex @xmath32 at time @xmath22 .",
    "if the characteristics given by @xmath173 and @xmath174 satisfy the condition ( [ eq : charcond ] ) , then it follows from theorem [ th : nerman ] that the probability converges almost surely to a number in @xmath41 .",
    "this number is in general difficult to determine , but in the current case , denoting the total fitness @xmath175 , we get @xmath176 the total fitness in the alive population can be obtained by counting the population by the characteristic @xmath177 and the mother of the individual is alive@xmath178 .",
    "hence , by theorem [ th : nerman ] and the second remark following it , the ratio @xmath179 converges to 1 almost surely and it follows that @xmath180 this probability is strictly larger than 1/2 precisely when @xmath169 , that is , when the process is supercritical .",

    "we remark that @xmath187 and @xmath10 gives rise to the same exponential decay for any @xmath188 .",
    "indeed , @xmath189 where the sum in the exponent grows like @xmath190 for @xmath21 and is convergent for @xmath20 .",

    "we get that @xmath194 vertex deaths determined by a sublinear function of the fitness hence also destroy the power law distribution obtained without vertex death , bringing it down to a stretched exponential distribution .",
    "in contrast to the case when the vertices die at random however , the tail behavior of the distribution is changed by the vertex deaths .",
