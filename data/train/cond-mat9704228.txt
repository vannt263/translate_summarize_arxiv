    "consider a surface like si ( 001 ) , but one which does not reconstruct .",
    "such a surface is still uniaxial and it still switches by @xmath0 at alternating surface heights . at finite temperature @xmath1 , thermodynamically - excited steps appear .",
    "they separate domains of flat regions .",
    "the uniaxial structure leads to two distinct types of mono - atomic steps , labeled by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the subscripts denote whether the uniaxial direction in the upper terrace near the step is parallel  ( @xmath4 ) or normal  ( @xmath5 ) to the step edge . considering the fact that the uniaxial direction switches by @xmath0 at alternating surface heights , one finds , as shown in fig .  1",
    ", that the steps have the following topological properties  @xcite : ( i ) if two neighboring parallel steps are of the same type , one must be an up - step and the other a down - step .",
    "( ii ) if a step turns over @xmath0 it must change its type , from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and vice versa .",
    "bi - atomic steps exist as well  @xcite , but they are probably free - energetically unfavorable close to the roughening temperature  @xcite .",
    "these topological properties imply that terrace excitations have an ellipsoid shape , and that the long axes of nested terraces are parallel ( perpendicular ) if the height change is up - down or down - up ( up - up or down - down ) across the nested terraces .",
    "this creates an entropic penalty against forming hills and valleys . in other words",
    ", it opens the possibility to stabilize a dof phase without the need for step - step interactions  @xcite .",
    "thus far step - step interactions were believed to be crucial for the existence of dof phases . in this surface topology",

    "@xmath7 is an integer - valued height variable at each site @xmath8 .",
    "height differences between the nearest neighbor sites are restricted to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this means that only mono - atomic steps are allowed .",
    "bi - atomic steps can be included in a later stage if experimental evidence shows they remain important close to roughening temperatures . the model of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) contains two parameters .",
    "the @xmath11 terms distinguish between @xmath2 and @xmath3-type steps : @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the step energies . without loss of generality ,",
    "the uniaxial direction is taken to run vertically  ( horizontally ) at even  ( odd ) heights .",
    "the model hamiltonian contains two limiting cases .",
    "the conventional rsos model at @xmath14 displays a kosterlitz - thouless  ( kt ) type roughening transition between the flat and rough phases  @xcite . on the other hand , in the limit where @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath2 steps cost no energy while @xmath3 steps are frozen out . in a typical configuration",
    "the surface contains a set of randomly - placed parallel @xmath2 steps in the form of straight lines .",
    "however , the topological rule ( i ) requires that they are alternating up and down steps .",
    "this is a typical morphology of surfaces in the dof phase  @xcite .",
    "the dof phase is an intermediate phase between the flat and rough phases , where the steps are disordered positionally but have long - range up - down - up - down order .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this dof type structure is stable at finite temperatures , in terms of a fermionic type perturbation theory .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the phase diagram quantitatively through a detailed transfer matrix fss study .",
    "it is important to confirm the existence of the dof phase numerically .",
    "the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite was mostly qualitative .",
    "the other purpose of this work is to obtain a good estimate for the critical value of the ratio @xmath17 , below which the dof phase disappears , see fig .  2 .",
    "in real surfaces this ratio takes specific values .",
    "for example , observations of step fluctuations in stm and leed experiments yield for si ( 001 ) that @xmath18  ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 )  @xcite . by comparing this ratio with the critical value @xmath21",
    ", one can decide which path the si ( 001 ) surface follows .",
    "our model , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , does not incorporate the @xmath22 type dimerized surface reconstruction of si and ge ( 001 ) .",
    "therefore it does not describe the competition between surface reconstruction and surface roughening in those surfaces .",
    "this issue was addressed in ref .",
    "the preroughening line in fig .",
    "2 is most likely replaced by a pr induced simultaneous deconstruction transition and the roughening line segment at @xmath23 by a roughening induced simultaneous deconstruction transition .",
    "a proper quantitative description of this requires at least a rsos model coupled to an ising model .",
    "we did not study such a model , since the number of degrees of freedom becomes too large to obtain meaningful transfer matrix fss results .",
    "the precise location of @xmath21 in fig .",
    "2 is the result of a delicate entropy balancing act of nested terraces associated with the peculiar @xmath0 switching in the uniaxial direction .",
    "our value of @xmath21 should be meaningful for si and ge ( 001 ) if the coupling with the ising degrees of freedom does not change the value of @xmath21 by too much , which is a reasonable assumption .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we introduce various kinds of interface free energies .",
    "they decompose into the free energies of @xmath2 and @xmath3 type steps , and show distinct fss behaviors in the flat , dof , and rough phases .",
    "we obtain the phase diagram fig .  2 , by evaluating these interface free energies using the transfer matrix method .",
    "the numerical results and a summary are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "consider the model given by eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) on a finite @xmath24 lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc s ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the ordered flat phase is commensurate with pbc s .",
    "other ( gauge invariant ) boundary conditions ( bc s ) create frustrations , and thus impose steps in the surface .",
    "the interface free energy @xmath27 is defined as the excess free energy per unit length for each type of bc compared to that of pbc s .",
    "their fss behaviors are different in the various phases .",
    "we obtain the structure of the phase transitions by studying suitable ones .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under the global transformations @xmath28 for all integers @xmath29 .",
    "so it is natural to consider the following boundary conditions : step type bc s with @xmath30 and @xmath26 ; and anti - periodic type bc s with @xmath31 and @xmath26",
    ". we will refer to them as h1 and h2 respectively .",
    "similarly , v1 and v2 refer to the same bc s but with the roles of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 interchanged .",
    "the interface free energies are defined by @xmath34 with @xmath35 the partition function satisfying the boundary condition @xmath36 , and all energies and free energies measured in units of @xmath37 .    figure  3 shows the topological frustrations induced by these bc s .",
    "h1 and v1 require at least two parallel steps ; one is an @xmath2 type step and the other an @xmath3 type step ( see figs .  3 ( a ) and ( c ) )",
    ". therefore , @xmath38 and @xmath39 decompose into @xmath40 ; with @xmath41 and @xmath42 the @xmath2 and @xmath3 step free energies . on the other hand , h2 and v2",
    "can be satisfied by configurations with only one @xmath2 type step ( see figs .  3 ( b ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are equal into @xmath41 .",
    "these interface free energies must behave in a specific way in each type of phase .",
    "the step free energy @xmath42 is finite in the flat phase and also in the dof phase , but vanishes in the rough phase .",
    "the step free energy @xmath41 , is finite in the flat phase , but vanishes in both the dof and rough phase .",
    "therefore , in the flat phase , all four @xmath45 ( @xmath36=h1 , h2 , v1 , v2 ) are finite . in the dof phase , @xmath38 and @xmath39 remain finite , but @xmath43 and @xmath44 vanish ( exponentially with system size ) . in the rough phase , all four @xmath45 vanish ( as a powerlaw in the infinite @xmath32 and/or @xmath33 limit ) .",
    "the rough phase is a critical phase where its critical fluctuations are described by the gaussian model .",
    "the height - difference correlation function diverges logarithmically with distance : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the coupling constant of the gaussian model ( also called the stiffness constant ) .",
    "it varies continuously in the rough phase and takes the universal value @xmath48 at roughening transitions .",
    "the interface free energies vanish in the rough phase as powerlaws . in a semi - infinite geometry",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath38 and @xmath43 scale asymptotically as  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the aspect ratio of the lattice constants in the spatial and time - like directions .",
    "we evaluate the interface free energies through the transfer matrix .",
    "consider the transfer matrix for a square lattice rotated by @xmath52 as shown in fig .",
    "4 . in our units",
    "the aspect ratio is equal to @xmath53 ; one unit in time , @xmath54 is twice as big as the spatial unit @xmath55 .",
    "a height configuration @xmath56 in a row is represented by a state vector @xmath57 .",
    "it is convenient to replace the height variables by step variables @xmath58 , with @xmath59 .",
    "they take only the values @xmath9 , and @xmath10 due to the restricted solid - on - solid condition . the surface configuration in each row",
    "is therefore represented by @xmath60 where @xmath61 stands for @xmath62 .",
    "the elements of the transfer matrix @xmath63 are the boltzmann weights associated with height configurations @xmath60 and @xmath64 in successive rows .",
    "@xmath63 is sparse , and can be expressed in terms of a product over local vertex - type scattering matrices , acting on the @xmath60 and @xmath64 in successive rows and intermediate internal step variables @xmath65 , defined in fig .",
    "4 .    in the case of pbc s the step variables satisfy the conditions @xmath66 and @xmath67 in all rows .",
    "the partition function , @xmath68 , and the free energy , are obtained from the largest eigenvalue @xmath69 of @xmath70 in the @xmath49 limit .",
    "the transfer matrices @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the horizontal bc s h1 and h2 are easily defined . only the conditions",
    "the step variables must satisfy change : in the case of h1 , the step variables are again periodic , @xmath66 , but with @xmath73 in all rows . in the case of h2 ,",
    "the step variables are anti - periodic , @xmath74 , with no restriction in the value of @xmath75 .",
    "the partition function in each case is given by @xmath76 and the free energy , in the @xmath49 limit , is again obtained from the largest eigenvalue @xmath77 of @xmath78  ( @xmath79 h1 and h2 )",
    ". so the interface free energies are given by @xmath80    the transfer matrices for the two vertical bc s are more intricate .",
    "they involve the symmetry properties eq .",
    "( [ h+2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ -h+1 ] ) of the transfer matrix with pbc s .",
    "the translation invariance in the surface heights , eq .  ( [ h+2 ] ) , implies that @xmath70 commutes with the symmetry operator @xmath81 therefore , it is useful to distinguish between two classes of surface states , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , i.e. , all states with @xmath84 even and odd , respectively . from the parity type symmetry property eq .",
    "( [ -h+1 ] ) it follows that @xmath70 commutes also with the operator * r * , defined by @xmath85 where @xmath86 stands for @xmath87 .",
    "the transfer matrices for the vertical bc s can be expressed in term of @xmath70 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 as @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 $ ] .    to evaluate @xmath92",
    "one needs to keep track of the height in the first column modulo 4 .",
    "this makes this boundary condition less useful than its horizontal counter part h1 , where we do not need to keep track of the absolute height of the surface , and therefore can drop the @xmath93 label of the surface configurations altogether .",
    "so we discard @xmath92 in the following analysis .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath94 is very useful .",
    "it can be written as @xmath95 where @xmath96  ( @xmath97 ) is the @xmath98th largest eigenvalue of @xmath70 in the @xmath99 sector . by the @xmath99 sector , we mean the set of state vectors which are eigenvectors of * r * with the eigenvalue @xmath100 .",
    "unlike horizontal boundary conditions , @xmath44 depends on the entire eigenvalue spectra .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit , it can be approximated , up to the leading order , as @xmath101 where @xmath102  ( @xmath103 ) is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath70 in the @xmath99 sector .",
    "so the scaling behavior of @xmath44 is determined from the quantity @xmath104 i.e. , the mass gap between the two @xmath105-sectors .",
    "from the fact that @xmath44 is finite in the flat phase and vanishes in the dof and rough phases , it follows that this mass gap should be finite in the dof phase and vanish in the flat phase .",
    "we will use both v2 and h2 to locate the preroughening phase boundary .",
    "the largest eigenvalues in each sector of the transfer matrix are obtained using the conventional iteration method .",
    "an arbitrary initial vector projects onto the largest eigenvector by applying the transfer matrix repeatedly .",
    "@xmath102 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 are easily found by this method .",
    "@xmath103 is obtained by choosing the initial vector in the @xmath108 sector .",
    "the state vector is @xmath109 dimensional for an semi - infinite strip of width @xmath33 .",
    "the maximum strip width we can handle is @xmath110 .",
    "first , we focus on particular paths through the parameter space to illustrate the existence of the rough , dof , and the flat phases",
    ". the fss amplitude @xmath111 of the h1 type interface must converge to @xmath47 in the rough phase  ( see eq .",
    "( [ reta_h1 ] ) ) .",
    "numerical data of @xmath112 along the line @xmath113 are presented in fig .  5 ( a ) .",
    "it shows that @xmath38 scales as @xmath114 with continuously - varying amplitudes at small @xmath115 ( high temperatures ) . the @xmath114 scaling breaks down at large @xmath115",
    "this means that @xmath116 or @xmath117 becomes nonzero .",
    "the roughening transition should take place when @xmath112 reaches the universal kosterlitz - thouless value @xmath48 .",
    "this value is marked in fig .  5 ( a ) by a dashed line , and indeed it crosses the numerical curve in the crossover region .",
    "so the numerical data in fig .  5 ( a ) support that there is the rough phase at high temperatures , separated from the dof or flat phase through a kt roughening transition .",
    "we present also the fss amplitudes of the interface free energy @xmath43 and the mass gap @xmath118 , defined by @xmath119 along the line @xmath120 in figs .  5 ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "both quantities show crossing points .",
    "they signal the crossover between two regions .",
    "one where @xmath116 , the @xmath2-step free energy , vanishes ( at small @xmath115 ) and one where it is finite ( at large @xmath115 ) .",
    "this confirms the existence of the dof phase and the pr transition , since these free energy gaps must be finite in the flat phase but converge exponentially to zero in the dof phase .",
    "for some reason , the convergence for v2 is dramatically better than for h2 .    at kt type roughening transitions ,",
    "the stiffness constant takes the universal value @xmath48 .",
    "so we obtain a sequence of estimates of the roughening transition line by applying the condition @xmath121 for each @xmath33 .",
    "these are the roughening data points shown in fig .  2",
    ". a sequence of estimates for the pr transition line between the flat and dof phase can be obtained from the crossing points of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and also those of @xmath124 and @xmath125 . in fig .",
    "2 we show only the crossing points of v2 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "( those of h2 are much less convergent , see fig .",
    "5 ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "the scaling theory of pr transitions , tells us that the critical fluctuations are described by the gaussian model , but with @xmath47 greater than the universal kt value @xmath48 of the roughening transition  @xcite .",
    "we investigate this scaling behavior by studying the fss amplitudes of @xmath43 and @xmath118 . in the gaussian model , @xmath124 , does not vary continuously , instead it takes the universal value @xmath128 ( see eq .",
    "( [ reta_h2 ] ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the v2 type mass gap should scale as  @xcite @xmath129 this is related to the fact that at @xmath14 , the @xmath108 and @xmath130 sectors of @xmath70 are equivalent apart from a phase factor @xmath131 attached to all step variables @xmath132 at the seam ( the first column of the lattice ) .    in fig .",
    "6 ( a ) we present the fss amplitude of the mass gap @xmath118 .",
    "the vertical axis is scaled as @xmath133 , such that it represents @xmath47 , see eq .",
    "( [ m_half ] ) .",
    "@xmath47 starts - off close to the universal value @xmath48 in the neighbourhood of the roughening transition , at @xmath134 , and increases with @xmath115 .",
    "this is in accordance with the assertion that the pr transition is described by the gaussian model with continuously varying @xmath47 greater than @xmath48 .",
    "the fss behaviour of @xmath135 along the pr line is shown in fig .",
    "the dashed line denotes the universal value @xmath136 of the gaussian model .",
    "the data at large @xmath115 remain far from the universal value , though approach it .",
    "like before , the convergence of this quantity is poor ( see also fig .",
    "5(b ) ) .    the pr transition line in fig .",
    "2 seems to penetrate into the rough phase .",
    "but this does not mean that there is another transition inside the rough phase .",
    "the rough phase is a critical phase where the mass gap scales as @xmath137 on either side of the crossing points .",
    "the presence of crossing points of v2 inside the rough phase represents only a turn around in the corrections to scaling amplitudes for the amplitude .",
    "the crossing of the two sets of lines in fig .",
    "2 , the estimates for the roughening and pr lines , confirms the existence of a multicritical point @xmath138 where the pr and roughening transition merge .",
    "a sequence of estimates @xmath139 for the multicritical point is obtained by solving the two conditions @xmath140 and @xmath141 simultaneously for each value of @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "these estimates are shown in fig .",
    "the arrows point towards power - law extrapolated values : @xmath142    in summary , we have investigated the phase transitions in a model system for si or ge ( 001 ) type crystal surfaces with an uniaxial structure that switches direction at each mono - atomic step .",
    "we obtained the phase diagram from a numerical fss study of the transfer matrix spectra .",
    "it consists of flat , rough , and dof phases .",
    "the unusual topological properties of the surface stabilize the dof phase in the absence of step - step interactions , which are crucial for the stabilization of the dof phase in conventional surfaces .",
    "the location of the multicritical point where the pr transition line merges to the roughening transition line is determined numerically , @xmath143 .",
    "specific crystals follow paths through fig .  2 resembling straight lines as function of temperature , since the step energies are approximately constant .",
    "our results shows that if the ratio @xmath144 is greater than a critical value @xmath143 , the flat unreconstructed crystal undergoes a pr transition into the dof phase followed by a roughening transition . in si",
    "( 001 ) surfaces , the ratio between the step energies is larger , @xmath145  @xcite .",
    "we suggest therefore that si ( 001 ) undergoes pr induced simultaneous deconstruction transition  @xcite .",
