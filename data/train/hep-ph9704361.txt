    "in the near future , it may become possible to constrain supersymmetry from high precision measurements of the cosmological parameters @xcite , among which the dark matter density .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to calculate the relic density of the lightest neutralino as accurately as possible .",
    "the lightest neutralino is one of the most promising candidates for the dark matter in the universe .",
    "it is believed to be the lightest stable supersymmetric particle in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "it is a linear combination of the superpartners of the neutral gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "the relic density of neutralinos in the mssm has been calculated by several authors during the years @xcite with various degrees of precision .",
    "a complete and precise calculation including relativistic boltzmann averaging , subthreshold and resonant annihilations , and coannihilation processes is the purpose of this paper .",
    "as pointed out by griest and seckel @xcite one has to include coannihilations between the lightest neutralino and other supersymmetric particles heavier than the neutralino if they are close in mass .",
    "they considered coannihilations between the lightest neutralino and the squarks , which occur only accidentally when the squarks are only slightly heavier than the lightest neutralino .",
    "in contrast , mizuta and yamaguchi @xcite pointed out an unavoidable mass degeneracy that greatly affects the neutralino relic density : the degeneracy between the lightest and next - to - lightest neutralinos and the lightest chargino when the neutralino is higgsino - like .",
    "they considered coannihilations between the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino , but only for neutralinos lighter then the @xmath2 boson and only with an approximate relic density calculation .",
    "moreover , they did not consider higgs bosons in the final states .",
    "drees and nojiri @xcite included coannihilations into their relic density calculation , but only between the lightest and next - to - lightest neutralinos .",

    "we perform a full calculation of the neutralino relic density for any neutralino mass and composition , including for the first time all coannihilations between neutralinos and charginos .",
    "we properly compute the thermal average , particularly in presence of thresholds and resonances in the annihilation cross sections .",
    "we include all two - body final states of neutralino - neutralino , neutralino - chargino and chargino - chargino annihilations .",
    "we leave coannihilations with squarks @xcite for future work , since they only occur accidentally when the squarks happen to be close in mass to the lightest neutralino as opposed to the unavoidable mass degeneracy of the lightest two neutralinos and the lightest chargino for higgsino - like neutralinos .    in section  [ sec : mssmdef ]",

    "drees and nojiri  @xcite included coannihilations between the lightest and next - to - lightest neutralino , but overlooked those between the lightest neutralino and chargino , which are always more important . in spite of this , they concluded that the relic density of a higgsino - like neutralino will always be uninterestingly small unless @xmath303 gev or so .",
    "drees at al .",
    "@xcite then re - investigated the relic density of light higgsino - like neutralinos .",
    "they found that light higgsinos could have relic densities as high as 0.2 , and so be cosmologically interesting , provided one - loop corrections to the neutralino masses are included .",
    "we agree with these papers qualitatively , but we reach different conclusions .",
    "we show our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : oh2vsmxh ] , where we plot the relic density of higgsino - like neutralinos versus their mass with coannihilations included , as well as the ratio between the relic densities with and without coannihilations .",
    "the mizuta and yamaguchi reduction can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : oh2vsmxh]b below 100 gev , but due to the recent lep2 bound on the chargino mass the effect is not as dramatic as it was for them . if for the sake of comparison we relax the lep2 bound , the reduction continues down to @xmath304 at lower higgsino masses and we confirm qualitatively the mizuta and yamaguchi conclusion  coannihilations are very important for light higgsinos  but we differ from them quantitatively since we find models in which light higgsinos have a cosmologically interesting relic density . for the specific light higgsino models in drees",
    "@xcite we agree on the relic density to within 2030% .",
    "we find however other light higgsino - like models with higher @xmath305 , even without including the loop corrections to the neutralino masses .",
    "so there is a window of light higgsino models , @xmath306 gev , that are cosmologically interesting .",
    "all these models have @xmath307 and those with the highest relic densities have @xmath308 .",
    "these models escape the lep2 bound on the chargino mass , @xmath309 gev , because for @xmath310 the mass of the lightest neutralino can be lower than the mass of the lightest chargino by tens of gev . by the same token , coannihilation processes are not so important and the relic density in these models remains cosmologically interesting .",
    "most of these models will be probed in the near future when lep2 runs at higher energies , but some have too large a chargino mass ( @xmath311 gev ) and too large an @xmath312 boson mass ( @xmath313 gev ) to be tested at lep2 . thus @xmath314 gev higgsinos with @xmath315 may remain good dark matter candidates even after lep2 .",
    "coannihilations for higgsino - like neutralinos heavier than the w boson have been mentioned by drees and nojiri  @xcite , who argued that they should not change the relic density by much , and by mcdonald , olive and srednicki  @xcite , who warn that they might change it by an estimated factor of 2 .",
    "we are the first to present a quantitative evaluation in this case .",
    "we typically find a decrease by factors of 25 , and in some models even by a factor of 10 ( see the right hand part of fig .",
    "[ fig : oh2vsmxh]b ) .    for @xmath316 , the lightest and next - to - lightest neutralinos and the lightest chargino are close in mass , and they annihilate into @xmath2-bosons besides fermion pairs . while the annihilation and coannihilation cross sections into @xmath2-pairs are comparable",
    ", the coannihilation of @xmath317 , @xmath318 and @xmath319 into fermion pairs is stronger than the @xmath320 annihilation .",
    "this gives the increase in the effective annihilation rate that we observe .    as a result ,",
    "the smallest and highest masses for which higgsino - like neutralinos heavier than the @xmath2 boson are good dark matter candidates shift up from 300 to 450 gev and from 3 to 7 tev respectively .    together with the result in the previous subsection ,",
    "we conclude that higgsino - like neutralinos ( @xmath88 ) can be good dark matter candidates for masses in the ranges 6085 gev and 4507000 gev .",
    "coannihilations for mixed or gaugino - like neutralinos have not been included in earlier calculations .",
    "it has been believed that they are not very important in these cases . on the contrary , when @xmath321 as the vertical strip at @xmath295 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oh2vsmxmum1 ] the relic density including coannihilations and the ratio of the relic density with to that without coannihilations are shown versus the neutralino mass for models with @xmath322 .",
    "we recall that in models with @xmath323 the lightest neutralino can be higgsino - like , mixed or gaugino - like .",
    "if the lightest neutralino is mixed ( @xmath324 ) , coannihilations can increase the relic density , whereas if it is more higgsino - like or gaugino - like they will decrease it .",
    "this because the annihilation cross section for mixed neutralinos is generally higher than those for higgsino - like or gaugino - like neutralinos .",
    "the largest decrease we see for this kind of models is when @xmath325 is slightly less than @xmath79 and both are in the tev region . in this case , the lightest neutralino is a very pure bino , and its annihilation cross section is very suppressed since it couples neither to the @xmath6 nor to the @xmath2 boson .",
    "the chargino and other neutralinos close in mass have much higher annihilation cross sections , and thus coannihilations between them greatly reduce the relic density . this big reduction suffices to lower @xmath326 to cosmologically acceptable levels if @xmath327 .",
    "this reduction does not occur for masses much lower than a tev , because the terms in the neutralino mass matrix proportional to the @xmath2 mass prevent such pure bino states and such severe mass degeneracy .    to conclude , when @xmath300",
    ", coannihilations are very important no matter if the neutralino is higgsino - like , mixed or gaugino - like",
    ". the relic density can be cosmologically interesting for these models as long as the gaugino fraction @xmath328 : these neutralinos are good dark matter candidates .      when @xmath329 , the lightest neutralino is a very pure gaugino .",
    "according to the gut relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : m1 ] ) , the supersymmetric particles next in mass , the next - to - lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino , are twice as heavy .",
    "so we expect that coannihilations between them are of no importance .",
    "in fact , as discussed in section  [ sec : nummethods ] , coannihilations would need to increase the effective cross section by several orders of magnitude for these large mass differences .",
    "this actually happens in some cases , the small spread at @xmath330 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiovsmum1 ] . in these models ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is a very pure bino ( @xmath331 ) and the squarks are heavy .",
    "its annihilation to fermions is suppressed by the heavy squark mass , and its annihilation to @xmath6 and @xmath2 bosons is either kinematically forbidden or extremely suppressed because a pure bino does not couple to @xmath6 and @xmath2 bosons . on the other side ,",
    "the lightest chargino is a very pure wino , which annihilates to gauge bosons and fermions very efficiently .",
    "the huge increase in the effective cross section , compensated by the large mass difference , reduces the relic density by 1020% .",
    "however , the relic density before introducing coannihilations was of the order of @xmath332@xmath333 , and this small reduction is not enough to render these special cases cosmologically interesting .",
    "we now summarize when the neutralino is a good dark matter candidate .",
    "[ fig : cosmregion ] shows the cosmologically interesting region @xmath334 in the neutralino mass  composition plane @xmath335 versus  @xmath336 .",
    "the light higgsino - like region does not extend to the left and down because of the lep2 bound on the chargino mass .",
    "the lower edge in gaugino fraction at @xmath337 is the border of our survey ( how high @xmath338 is allowed to be ) .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath339 and the upper limit on the neutralino mass come from the requirement @xmath340 .",
    "the hole for higgsino - like neutralinos with masses 85450 gev comes from the requirement @xmath341 .",
    "we see that coannihilations change the cosmologically interesting region in the following aspects : the region of light higgsino - like neutralinos is slightly reduced and the big region of heavier higgsinos is shifted to higher masses , the lower boundary shifting from 300 gev to 450 gev and the upper boundary from 3 tev to 7 tev .",
    "the fuzzy edge at the highest masses is due to models in which the squarks are close in mass to the lightest neutralino , in which case @xmath7- and @xmath8-channel squark exchange enhances the annihilation cross section . in these rather accidental cases , coannihilations with squarks",
    "are expected to be important and enhance the effective cross section even further .",
    "thus , the upper bound of 7 tev on the neutralino mass may be an underestimate .",
    "we have performed a detailed evaluation of the relic density of the lightest neutralino , including for the first time all two - body coannihilation processes between neutralinos and charginos for general neutralino masses and compositions .",
    "we have generalized the relativistic formalism of gondolo and gelmini  @xcite to properly treat ( sub)threshold and resonant annihilations also in presence of coannihilations .",
    "we have found that coannihilations can formally be considered as thresholds in a suitably defined lorentz - invariant effective annihilation rate .",
    "our results confirm qualitatively the conclusion of mizuta and yamaguchi  @xcite : the inclusion of coannihilations when @xmath342 is very important when the neutralino is higgsino - like .",
    "in contrast to their calculation we do however find a window of cosmologically interesting higgsino - like neutralinos where the masses are @xmath343 gev and @xmath344 .",
    "this is due primarily to a milder mass degeneracy at low @xmath345 , and secondarily to the one - loop corrections to the neutralino masses pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also find that coannihilations are important for heavy higgsino - like neutralinos , @xmath346 , for which the relic density can decrease by typically a factor of 25 , but sometimes even by a factor of 10 .",
    "higgsino - like neutralinos with @xmath347 gev can have @xmath348 and hence make up at least a major part of the dark matter in galaxies .",
    "when @xmath300 , coannihilations will always be important : they can decrease the relic density by up to a factor of 100 or even increase it by up to a factor of 3 . in these models ,",
    "the neutralino is either higgsino - like , mixed or gaugino - like , and when the gaugino fraction @xmath328 , the relic density can be cosmologically interesting .",
    "coannihilations between neutralinos and charginos increase the cosmological upper limit on the neutralino mass from 3 to 7 tev .",
    "coannihilations with squarks might increase it further .",
    "coannihilation processes must be included for a correct evaluation of the neutralino relic density when @xmath329 and when @xmath349 . in the first case ,",
    "the neutralino is a very pure gaugino and its relic density overcloses the universe . in the second case , the neutralino is either higgsino - like , mixed or gaugino - like , and for each of these types there are many models where it is a good dark matter candidate . to establish this , the inclusion of coannihilations has been essential .",
