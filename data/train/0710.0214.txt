    "the notion of extra dimensions and that they can be probed by gravitons and eventually non - standard matter has been the focus of attention in recent years .",
    "these models usually yield the correct newtonian @xmath3-potential at large distances because the gravitational field is quenched on sub - millimeter transverse scales .",
    "this quenching appears either due to finite extension of the transverse dimensions @xcite or due to sub - millimeter transverse curvature scales induced by negative cosmological constants @xcite .",
    "a common feature of both of these types of models and also of the old kaluza - klein type models is the prediction of deviations from four - dimensional einstein gravity at short distances .",
    "if the transverse length scale is not too small , this implies the possibility to generate bulk gravitons in accelerators or stars @xcite .",
    "the model of dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) @xcite , see @xcite for extensions , is different , predicting that 4-dimensional einstein gravity is a short - distance phenomenon with deviations showing up at large distances .",
    "the transition between four and higher - dimensional gravitational potentials in the dgp model arises as a consequence of the presence of both the brane and bulk einstein terms in the action .",
    "further , it was observed in @xcite that the dgp model allows for an embedding of the standard friedmann cosmology in the sense that the cosmological evolution of the background metric on the brane can entirely be described by the standard friedmann equation plus energy conservation on the brane .",
    "this was later generalized to arbitrary number of transverse dimensions in @xcite .",
    "for a recent and comprehensive review of the phenomenology of dgp cosmology , the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation made a few years ago is that the expansion of our universe is currently undergoing a period of acceleration which is directly measured from the light - curves of several hundred type ia supernovae @xcite and independently from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the wmap satellite @xcite and other cmb experiments @xcite . however , the mechanism responsible for this acceleration is not well understood and many authors introduce a mysterious cosmic fluid , the so called dark energy , to explain this effect @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that such an accelerated expansion could be the result of a modification to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite . a scenario where the issue of cosmic acceleration in the framework of higher order theories of gravity in @xmath4 is addressed",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the first proposals in this regards was suggested in @xcite where a term of the form @xmath5 was added to the usual einstein - hilbert action .",
    "it was then shown that this term could give rise to accelerating solutions of the field equations without dark energy . in @xcite a dgp brane model with a scalar field on the brane",
    "was proposed , predicting that for the gravitational potential , the mass density should be modified by the addition of the mass density of the scalar filed on the brane .",
    "such a scalar field has its origin in the conformal transformation used to transform the action in the jordan frame to the einstein frame in the usual @xmath4 modified gravity . for non - minimally coupled scalar field scenarios",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper , we focus attention on the dgp brane model where the action contains an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar , @xmath0 , and obtain the evolution of the metric on the space - time .",
    "we concentrate on a specific form for @xmath6 and solve the resulting dynamical equations , predicting a power - law acceleration on the brane .",
    "the components of the metric in the gaussian normal coordinates are then calculated and presented .",
    "finally , we show that there exists two classes of solutions close to the usual frw cosmology for small hubble radii in the model presented here .",
    "we start by writing the action for the dgp model with an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature on the brane part of the action , that is @xmath8,\\ ] ] where the first term in ( [ eq1 ] ) corresponds to the einstein - hilbert action in @xmath9 for the 5-dimensional bulk metric @xmath10 , with the ricci scalar denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the second term is the modified einstein - hilbert action with @xmath7 corresponding to the induced metric @xmath12 on the brane , where @xmath7 is some arbitrary function of the @xmath4 scalar curvature and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are reduced planck masses in four and five dimensions respectively with @xmath15 being the matter action on the brane with a matter field denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the induced metric @xmath12 is defined as usual from the bulk metric @xmath10 by @xmath17 it would now be possible to write the field equations resulting from this action , yielding , in @xmath18 spatial dimensions @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the energy - momentum tensor in the matter frame , and @xmath22+{\\cal l'}(r)^{;\\alpha\\beta}(q_{\\mu\\alpha}q_{\\nu\\beta}-q_{\\mu\\nu}q_{\\alpha\\beta})\\right\\}.\\ ] ] a prime here denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath23 . note that @xmath23 lives on the brane .",
    "the corresponding junction conditions , relating the extrinsic curvature to the energy - momentum tensor , become @xmath24^{y=+\\epsilon}_{y=-\\epsilon } & = & \\left.\\frac{{\\cal l}'(r)}{m^{3}_{4}}\\left(\\hat{t}_{\\mu\\nu}+ t^{({\\it curv})}_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{1}{d-1}q_{\\mu\\nu}q^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(\\hat{t}_{\\alpha\\beta}+ t^{({\\it curv})}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)\\right)\\right|_{y=0}\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left.\\frac{{\\cal l}'(r)m^{2}_{3}}{m^{3}_{4}}\\left(r^{(d-1)}_{\\mu\\nu}- \\frac{1}{2(d-1)}q_{\\mu\\nu}q^{\\alpha\\beta}r^{(d-1)}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)\\right|_{y=0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be noted that @xmath25 is a function of the brane parameters .",
    "from the fact that the dgp model predicts deviations only at large distances , one might hope it could be ruled out from cosmological observations . however",
    ", as we shall see , it could account for cosmological equations of motion at any distance scale on the brane with any function of the ricci scalar .",
    "brane cosmology usually starts from the line element @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a maximally symmetric 3-dimensional metric with @xmath28 being the usual parameters denoting the spatial curvatures . building on the results of @xcite , the cosmological evolution equations of a 3-brane in a @xmath9 bulk resulting from equations ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] )",

    "this particular value of @xmath2 warrants a further discussion .",
    "it is well known that in ordinary @xmath4 gravity an action of the form @xmath106 results in a constant scale factor in a cosmological setting without any ordinary matter and a singular equation of state for @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising to expect the same behavior in dgp models when the action on the brane is taken as that mentioned above .",

    "the corresponding result for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 is also spelled out in @xcite . using equations ( [ eq43 ] ) and ( [ eqq43 ] ) we can deduce the equation of state for the family of solutions @xmath111 . we then have @xmath112 which clearly behaves as @xmath113 for @xmath114 , playing the role of a cosmological constant . for @xmath115 which corresponds to @xmath116",
    "we have a power - law acceleration on the brane without having to introduce dark energy .",
    "this result is consistent with the observational results similar to dark energy with the equation of state parameter @xmath117 @xcite . using equations ( [ eqq55 ] ) and ( [ eq60 ] )",
    "we obtain the deceleration parameter @xmath118 it is clear that for @xmath119 we have @xmath120 .",
    "this means that the universe ( brane ) is continuously expanding at an ever - increasing rate .",
    "clearly , for @xmath121 or @xmath116 we obtain @xmath122 .",
    "it is worth noting again , as was mentioned before , that in the normal dgp model , that is when @xmath105 and with no ordinary matter present , we can not define the equation of state and deceleration parameter because the scale factor on the brane is constant , see equations ( [ eq56 ] ) and ( [ eq57 ] ) .",
    "we therefore expect the same behavior in our model and see that these equations diverge for @xmath105 .",

    "there appears coordinate singularities on the space - like hypercone @xmath134 .",
    "this is presumably a consequence of the fact that the orthogonal geodesics emerging from the brane ( which we used to set up our gaussian normal system , @xmath135 ) do not cover the full five - dimensional space - time .",
    "in this section we derive the friedman equations for the brane metric in the presence of @xmath7 in the brane part of dgp action .",

    "for @xmath105 this matches the scale @xmath152 found in @xcite , setting the crossover between the @xmath4 and @xmath9 gravity regimes . for the special case @xmath121 , or @xmath116 for which a power - law acceleration consistent with @xmath153 is obtained we have @xmath154 also , for @xmath155 @xmath156 one",
    "has @xmath157 thus , the hubble radius @xmath149 in this model depends on @xmath2 . for the hubble radius when equation ( [ eq68 ] ) is not satisfied ,",
    "there are two distinct behaviors depending on @xmath158 .",
    "equation ( [ eq66 ] ) can indeed be rewritten as @xmath159 let us start by examining the case where @xmath160 . using condition @xmath161 , one",
    "may then expand ( [ eq66 ] ) to obtain @xmath162 or @xmath163 which is the full @xmath9 regime with @xmath7 gravity on the brane .",
    "equation ( [ eq74 ] ) for @xmath1 becomes @xmath164 note that @xmath84 is a function of @xmath23 .",
    "one has thus a transition from a @xmath4 to a @xmath9 regime .",
    "if @xmath165 , however , @xmath166 is always larger than @xmath167 given by @xmath168 where @xmath169 . for @xmath1",
    "we find @xmath170 and the expansion will never enter into a fully @xmath9 regime .",
    "thus for @xmath137 or @xmath171 the hubbel parameter is bounded from below by equation ( [ eq76 ] ) for @xmath1 on the brane .",
    "an interesting feature of the normal dgp models is the existence of ghost - like excitations @xcite",
    ". it would therefore be interesting to briefly mention recent results relevant to the present work .",
    "in @xcite , the author has shown , in the context of normal dgp models , that if we introduce a positive cosmological constant on the brane @xmath172 , then the spin-2 graviton will have a mass in the range @xmath173 and that there is a normalizable brane fluctuation mode with mass @xmath174 .",
    "although the brane fluctuation mode is healthy , the spin-2 graviton has a helicity-0 excitation which is known as a ghost .",
    "if we allow a negative cosmological constant on the brane , the brane bending mode becomes a ghost for @xmath175 .",
    "this confirms the results obtained by the boundary effective action that there exists a scalar ghost mode for @xmath176 . in a self - accelerating universe@xmath177",
    ", the spin-2 graviton has mass @xmath174 , which is known to be a special case for massive gravitons in de sitter spacetime where the graviton has no helicity-0 excitation and so no ghost .",
    "however , in dgp models , there exists a brane fluctuation mode with the same mass and there arises a mixing between the brane fluctuation mode and the spin-2 graviton .",
    "thus , according to this scenario , our model may be prone to having ghosts and this could be the subject of a separate investigation .",
    "brane models generally provide an interesting extension of our parameter space for gravitational theories . in this work",
    "we have discussed the dgp model with an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar in the brane part of action .",
    "the cosmological evolution of this model was studied by solving the relevant dynamical equations .",
    "the components of the metric on the space - time was obtained for the @xmath1 term in @xmath4 gravity .",
    "the evolution of the universe in such a scenario was shown to be consistent with the present observations , predicting an accelerated expansion .",
    "finally we have shown that there exists two classes of solutions , close to the usual frw cosmology for small enough hubble radii for @xmath7 gravity .",
