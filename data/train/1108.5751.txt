    "he proved a nice characterization of hereditary coreflective subcategories using prime factors of topological spaces .",
    "however , it would be interesting to study the hereditary coreflective subcategories also in other categories of topological spaces , as @xmath9or , more generally , any epireflective subcategory of @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the situation becomes more complicated than in @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , in @xmath8we obtain the hereditary coreflective hull of a coreflective subcategory c simply by taking the subcategory c consisting of all subspacesof spaces from c. this is not true in the case of coreflective subcategories of @xmath9anymore , as the example of @xmath10-subsequential spaces ( see @xcite or @xcite ) shows .",
    "the hereditary coreflective hull of hausdorff sequential spaces in @xmath9are precisely the hausdorff subsequential spaces . but not every hausdorff subsequential space is a subspaceof a hausdorff sequential space .",
    "so the description of the hereditary coreflective hull mentioned above does not work in @xmath9 .",
    "although we see that this new situation leads to some complications , in @xcite it is proved that the same characterization holds if we study the same problem in an epireflective subcategory a of @xmath8 , which is not bireflective .",
    "namely , it is shown that a coreflective subcategory of a is hereditary if and only ifit is closed under the formation of prime factors .",
    "this paper is an attempt to study a similar situation and to add a few new results in this area of research .",
    "we study here mainly the subcategories which are additive and divisible ( i.e. , closed under sums and quotient spaces ) in a. we call them briefly ad - classes .",
    "the ad - classes include coreflective subcategories as a special case .",
    "if @xmath0 is a quotient - reflective subcategory of @xmath8(in particular if @xmath11 ) , then there is no difference between these two notions .",
    "we show that in many cases an ad - class b in a is hereditary if and only ifit is closed under the formation of prime factors .",
    "e.g. , this holds if @xmath5 or @xmath4 contains at least one prime space .",
    "we also present a method how to extend our results to bireflective subcategories of @xmath8 .",
    "( maybe it is more precise to say that the restriction to non - bireflective subcategories is in fact not so restrictive . ) for this purpose we use the correspondence between bireflective subcategories of @xmath8and epireflective subcategories of @xmath8consisting only of @xmath7-spaces .",
    "this correspondence was introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "topological terminology follows @xcite with a few exceptions .",
    "we do not assume the @xmath12 separation axiom for zero - dimensional spaces .",
    "a neighborhood of @xmath13 is any set @xmath14 such that there exists an open subset @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "( so the neighborhoods in the sense of @xcite are open neighborhoods in our terminology . )",
    "compact spaces are not necessarily hausdorff . for the notions and results from category theory we refer to @xcite , in particular for reflective and coreflective subcategories of the category @xmath8of topological spaces and continuous maps to @xcite .",
    "all subcategories are assumed to be full and isomorphism - closed . to avoid some trivial cases we assume that every subcategory of @xmath8contains at least one space with at least two points .",
    "by @xmath17 we mean that the spaces @xmath18 and @xmath19 have the same underlying set and @xmath18 has a finer topology than @xmath19 . by _",
