    "recent progress of brillouin spectroscopy at very high pressures@xcite has revealed that interatomic forces in fcc solid argon must be far beyond any kinds of two - body , central force model .",
    "et al._@xcite precisely measured a large violation of the cauchy relation up to 70 gpa and stressed the important role of many - body forces , in order to construct good potentials for high - density noble gases , which should be crucial in understanding their behavior in planetary bodies by means of molecular simulations .",
    "the cauchy relation@xcite for the elastic constants of cubic crystals at a hydrostatic pressure @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 , which must be satisfied in centrosymmetric cubic crystals , including the fcc solid argon , if the total energy is given by sum of purely pairwise terms .",
    "the deviation from it is therefore a measure of the many - atom nature of interatomic interactions .",
    "the aziz - slaman model for high pressure argon@xcite , which might be one of the most sophisticated yet simple ones thus far proposed , fails to reproduce any violation of cauchy relation , simply because the model is pairwise .    on the other hand ,",
    "the _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) approach using the pseudopotential planewave method@xcite , and that with projector - augmented wave implementation for core electrons@xcite , and linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method@xcite have successfully reproduced the observed elastic constants , as well as the density of the solid argon over the measured range of the pressure . from these theoretical results",
    ", it should be a natural and logical consequence that one would expect to have an simple and reasonably accurate model for the many - atom interaction in condensed argon , by coarse - graining the _ ab initio _ electronic models to a rather empirical atomistic model .",
    "the importance of many - body forces in solid argon at high pressures has been examined by several authors along the idea of many - atom expansion@xcite , in which one assumes that the total energy is ` additively ' decomposable into @xmath2-atom ( @xmath3 ) terms plus the additional energy of zero - point vibrations , and that the expansion is well convergent .",
    "the three - atom contribution from the exchange energy was emphasized@xcite because it stabilise argon in fcc structure , rather than the hcp , which is predicted by all the available pairwise models without the zero - point energy@xcite .",
    "however , it is pointed out that the convergence of this type of expansion becomes worse in a situation in which many - atom effect is more important@xcite .",
    "figure [ ab - initio - c - decomp ] shows the cauchy violation defined by @xmath4 and its breakdown into the contributions from kinetic , electrostatic and exchange - correlation energies predicted@xcite by using all - electron calculation within dft@xcite .",
    ", decomposed into contributions from the kinetic ( thin solid ) , electrostatic ( dot - dashed ) , and exchange - correlation ( dashed ) energies . ]",
    "each curve is plotted as a function of the total pressure .",
    "clearly , the central role for the observed negative @xmath5 is played by kinetic energy , which remains after the large cancellation by the opposite contributions from electrostatic and exchange - correlation .",
    "it should be noted that non - zero contribution from the electrostatic energy immediately excludes a primitive picture of overlapping frozen atomic charge - density .",
    "therefore , it is implied that deformation of density ( wavefunctions ) should be relevant .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop an analytic interatomic potential for solid argon , that is based on the quantum mechanics of electrons , and that can well reproduce the observed elastic properties including the cauchy violation at high pressures , yet that is made as simple as possible .",
    "the problem we are to treat now has a close link to the broad field of computational materials science , since the inclusion of environment dependence in short - ranged repulsion is sometimes crucial@xcite in obtaining reliable and transferable models for simulations in empirical and semi - empirical approaches .    in section 2 ,",
    "a tight - binding description for overlap repulsion in closed - shell atoms , which depends on atomic environment , will be presented as the theoretical base that underpins more empirical and analytic model .",
    "general properties of repulsive potential with environment - dependent parameters are analysed , and a simple functional form for the overlap repulsion is designed for argon and proposed in section 3 .",
    "the result of the fitted analytic potential is presented in section 4 , followed by a concluding section 5 .",
    "a system of closed - shell atoms may be well described within the non - orthogonal tight - binding bond model ( tbbm)@xcite , in which the total binding energy is given by @xmath6 the first term is the covalent energy @xmath7 -2\\mathrm{tr}[\\mathsf{h } ]   = -2\\mathrm{tr}[\\mathsf{h}\\mathsf{o}\\mathsf{s}^{-1 } ] , \\label{ecov - closed - shell}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the hamiltonian and overlap matrices defined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 in a basis set of atomic orbitals @xmath12 , where @xmath13 runs over orbitals on site @xmath14 .",

    "note that eq.([ecov - overlap - rep ] ) has no explicit dependence on @xmath27 .",

    "this parabolic behaviour occurs as a result of the change in the effective radius of the atomic wavefunction , regardless of particular form of the atomic pseudopotentials .",
    "therefore , we may assume for the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath16 that @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants , and thus , @xmath18 has the role of penalty for localisation of atomic orbitals through eq .",
    "( [ hii ] ) , while the localisation will reduce the magnitude of overlap repulsion .",
    "therefore the optimum values of @xmath48 will be determined by minimizing @xmath56 with respect to each @xmath57 . in the case of @xmath24-shells ,",

    "\\label{kappa - eqn}\\ ] ]    the set of solutions is indeed environment - dependent and we see that the constant @xmath54 is the solution for the limiting case of infinitely separated atoms . since the penalty due to increase in the kinetic energy is steep , @xmath61 would be small enough to replace @xmath62 in the exponential in eq.([kappa - eqn ] ) with @xmath54 .",
    "this solves the equation to give explicit @xmath63 that is exact to first order .",
    "the energy increase @xmath64 due to this minimisation is given exactly by the sum of 3@xmath65 , which partially sets off and just halves the lowest order decrease in overlap energy @xmath66 .",
    "the resultant lowering , @xmath67 , could be obtained by employing @xmath68 instead of @xmath69 in the overlap energy .",
    "this treatment _ eliminates _ @xmath64 and simplifies the functional form of the potential , which is to be proposed in the next section .",
    "the environmental effect that we are looking at is a tendency that more contracted atomic orbitals are preferred in a denser environment .",
    "the physics behind it has been beautifully justified in the pioneering work by skinner and pettifor@xcite , who have implemented the chemical pseudopotential theory using the orbital exponent as a variational parameter within the harris - foulkes scheme@xcite , and found that the orbital exponents ( @xmath52 s in our notation ) of hydrogen atoms in molecule , simple cubic and fcc lattices are strongly environment - dependent as stated above .",
    "let us first analyse some general properties of a repulsive potential that is a function of environment - dependent parameters as well as the distance",
    ".    provided that the functional form of repulsive interatomic potential is given by @xmath70 with the environment - dependent parameters ( @xmath71 s ) that are written as a sum of pairwise functions , namely @xmath72 cauchy violation can be calculated analytically for cubic lattice .",

    "@xmath80 represents the strength of environmental effect on atom @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath82 at this point is completely arbitrary , we may assume that it is a positive and monotonically decreasing function of distance in the range of interest ; hence @xmath83 .",
    "it may also be a physically reasonable assumption that the repulsive potential @xmath84 is also a monotonically decreasing function of distance in the range of interest .",
    "we see from eq.([eq : delta - analytic ] ) for the case of very weak @xmath80 that negative cauchy violation occurs if @xmath85 .",
    "this condition is likely to be fulfilled , since an environmental effect tends to weaken the overlap repulsion to give @xmath86 , as we have seen in the previous section .",

    "we see environmental effect , the second term , causes reduction in pressure as expected .",
    "a simple functional form of overlap repulsion that takes into account the physics of the environment effect as we have discussed is now proposed , that is , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is environmentally independent pairwise function .",
    "the environmental effect on site @xmath14 is entering in a very simple separable form by a factor @xmath91 , which corresponds to the contraction factor @xmath92 .",
    "however , the direct dependence on the particular length @xmath93 has been dropped for simplicity .",
    "this manner of parameterisation for the environmental effect can also be seen in the ` breathing - shell model ' ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) and ` compressible ion model'@xcite for oxides , such as mgo .",
    "the both models are provided with the parameters that correspond to the variation in effective size of ionic cores , and reduction in core size causes exponential reduction as @xmath94 in the present model does .",
    "it should be noted that a kind of penalty function has been eliminated from the present model as it was justified in the previous section .",
    "the contraction factor of type @xmath92 was modelled by nguyen - manh _ et al .",
    "_ in the form of screened yukawa - type potential@xcite and it was used to explain cauchy pressures in transition metals intermetallics within a tight - binding and harris - foulkes approaches .",

    "together with @xmath80 , three of other quantities representing the strength of environment - dependence are defined : @xmath104    , and pressure , @xmath0 , as a function of strength of environment - dependence , @xmath80 , for the repulsive potential .",

[ p - delta - vs - alpha0 ] .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath105 is unphysical point where our ` repulsive ' potential is found no longer repulsive , giving @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of dimensionless parameter @xmath80 should usually be much smaller than @xmath107 .",
    "an instructive example may be the case of inverse - power - law potential , @xmath108 , in which the critical value can be easily found to be @xmath109 .",
    "these analysis should be useful in understanding how the environmental dependence in repulsive worked for the problem of small or negative cauchy pressure ( @xmath110 for cubic systems , @xmath111 and @xmath112 for tetragonal or hexagonal systems ) in transition metals and intermetallic compounds@xcite . in these covalently bonded systems at equilibrium ,",

    "i.e. _ @xmath133 with @xmath134 j and @xmath135  , the parameters are fitted to the results@xcite by _ ab initio _ full - potential lmto calculations with the generalized gradient approximation of pw91 ( gga - pw91)@xcite for the exchange - correlation , since gga - pw91 results are remarkably in good agreement with the experimental results for solid argon .",

    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the elastic properties of fcc solid argon predicted by the present model compared with the experimental results .",
    "the agreement is impressive .",
    "however , a negative curvature in predicted @xmath5 at very high pressures can be seen as a small deviation , which is reflected in @xmath95 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 ( and not in @xmath139 ) as it can be understood from @xmath5-term ( and its absence ) in eqs.([eq : bs])-([eq : c44pkd ] ) .",
    "this will be corrected if we design more flexible function for @xmath79 .",
    "but if we do so , we also need to evaluate neglected terms , for example , the higher order many - atom effects due to @xmath140 factor , which will be handled in a separate study .",
    "the stability problem of fcc against hcp is still very subtle even with the present environment - dependent model without zero point energy .",
    "the result is very sensitive to the cutoff .",
    "for example , using only the present repulsive model ( without @xmath141 ) , the fcc  hcp difference in enthalpy is evaluated to be @xmath142 mev at 20 gpa and @xmath143 mev at 60 gpa if we include 86 neighbours within 6 shells in fcc and equivalently within 9 shells in hcp .",
    "the difference in the zero point energy@xcite would be dominant .",
    "therefore the environmental or many - atom effect in overlap repulsion may not be a remedy for the problem of fcc stability .",
    "we have developed an analytic and environment - dependent interatomic potential for the overlap repulsion in solid argon .",
    "the functional form , of environment - dependence in particular , is simple and physically transparent , being based on the non - orthogonal tight - binding theory for the closed - shell systems .",
    "the present model was shown to well reproduce the observed elastic properties of solid argon including the cauchy violation at high pressures .",
    "a useful and novel analysis has clearly demonstrated how the elastic properties are related to the environment - dependence incorporated into a generic pairwise potential .",
    "it is speculated that the present functional provides not only excellent description for elastic properties of a solid noble gas , but also useful description for the problem of small or negative cauchy pressures in covalently bonded systems .",
