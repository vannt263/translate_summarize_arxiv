    "in cosmological models with a big crunch / big bang transition , a key issue is the behavior as the universe contracts towards the crunch . from the classic studies of belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite and others @xcite , it is known that the contraction can either proceed smoothly or chaotically .",
    "these studies have focused on models in which the universe contains matter and radiation , or , more generally , an energy component whose equation of state is @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is defined as the ratio of the pressure @xmath2 to the energy density @xmath8 ) . if @xmath9 , a contracting homogeneous and isotropic solution is unstable to small perturbations in the anisotropy and spatial curvature .",
    "as the overall volume shrinks , the anisotropy causes the universe to expand along one axis and contract along the others , a state that can be approximated by the anisotropic kasner solution .",
    "the spatial curvature causes the axes and rates of contraction to undergo sudden jumps from one kasner - like solution to another , an effect known as `` mixmaster '' @xcite behavior . if the curvature is not spatially uniform , then the chaotic behavior in different regions is not synchronized and the universe becomes highly inhomogeneous at the big crunch .",
    "hence , mixmaster behavior could potentially wreak havoc in cosmological models with a big crunch / big bang transition , making them inconsistent with the observed large scale homogeneity of the universe .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the behavior of the universe as it approaches the big crunch is very different if there is an energy component with @xmath1 .",
    "the chaotic behavior is suppressed and the universe contracts homogeneously and isotropically as it approaches the singularity .",
    "the reason is that the anisotropy and curvature terms in the einstein equations grow rapidly and become dominant if @xmath9 , but they remain negligible compared to the energy density if @xmath1 . in the latter case ,",
    "the einstein equations converge to the friedmann equations with purely time - dependent terms , a condition sometimes referred to as `` ultralocality . ''",
    "the effect can be viewed as a generalization of the `` cosmic no - hair theorem '' invoked in a rapidly inflating universe . here",
    "we demonstrate analogous behavior in a slowly contracting universe with @xmath1 .",
    "a related result of dunsby et al @xcite shows that models with @xmath10 but with @xmath11 terms in the stress - energy tensor are also driven towards isotropy .",
    "the cosmic no hair theorem for a contracting universe containing a perfect fluid with @xmath12 is discussed in section [ sec : nohair ] .",
    "a common example of a perfect fluid is a scalar field @xmath13 with a potential @xmath14 . in section [ sec : pforms ] , we consider the interaction of the scalar @xmath13 with a @xmath2form field @xmath15 through an exponential coupling , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant @xcite .",
    "we consider this case because scalar fields with exponential couplings to @xmath2form fields are common in kaluza - klein , supergravity and superstring models .",
    "for the case @xmath18 , it is known @xcite that the contraction is not chaotic if @xmath17 lies within a bounded interval . here we show that , for _ any _ @xmath17 and @xmath2 , there is a critical value @xmath19 for which the chaotic behavior is suppressed if @xmath20 .",
    "our results are of particular importance for the recent ekpyrotic @xcite and cyclic @xcite cosmological models , which have a big crunch / big bang transition with a contraction phase dominated by a scalar field with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of perturbations leading up to and passing through the transition is an important aspect that remains unsettled @xcite , and may depend on the precise physical conditions leading up to the bounce @xcite .",
    "the present work may be relevant since it suggests that the universe can remain homogeneous and isotropic on large scales .",
    "once the evolution becomes ultralocal , the whole universe is following the same homogeneous and isotropic evolution all the way to the big crunch .    in section [ sec : time_vary ]",
    ", we explore how time - variation of @xmath3 affects our conclusions , and in particular how @xmath3 approaching @xmath21 from above may suppress chaotic behavior . in section [ sec : extrad ] we discuss some specific models . in particular , we show how orbifolding can remove @xmath2-forms that might induce chaotic behavior and discuss the special case of heterotic @xmath5-theory , which , to leading order in the eleven dimensional gravitational coupling @xmath22 , is on boundary between chaotic and smooth behavior .",
    "[ sec : nohair ]    the cornerstone of the inflationary paradigm is an argument known as the `` cosmic no - hair theorem '' , according to which a universe containing a perfect fluid component with @xmath23 will rapidly approach flatness , homogeneity and isotropy at late times , for a wide range of initial data ( namely those for which the space curvature , inhomogeneity and anisotropy are not very large ) @xcite . in the friedmann equation ,",
    "the energy density for a component with equation of state @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath24 , where the exponent @xmath25 .",
    "the anisotropy term is proportional to @xmath26 and the spatial curvature term is proportional to @xmath27 . as the universe expands , the contribution with the smallest values of @xmath28 redshifts away more slowly than components with larger values of @xmath28 and so come to dominate the friedmann equation and the components with the smallest value of @xmath28 overall ultimately dominate .",
    "if the energy component with the smallest value of @xmath3 has @xmath29 , then @xmath30 and this component dominates . for a wide range of initial data , convergence to a homogeneous and isotropic expanding universe",
    "is assured .",
    "below , we will present an analogous `` cosmic no - hair theorem '' for contracting universes . in a contracting universe",
    ", the component with the largest value of @xmath28 will dominate the friedmann equation .",
    "starting from an inhomogeneous and anisotropic initial state , we will show that the existence of a perfect fluid with @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) will suppress chaotic behavior , and enable a smooth and isotropic contraction to the big crunch .",
    "we will find that curvature plays a more complicated role compared to the case of expansion .",
    "hence , we first obtain a cosmic no - hair theorem for the case of zero spatial curvature and then generalize to the case of arbitrary spatial curvature .",
    "we intentionally take a pedagogical approach that encompasses known results for @xmath33 to make our discussion self - contained .",
    "our analysis assumes the initial inhomogeneity is small ; it is possible that the universe evolves towards other attractors for sufficiently large deviations from homogeneity .",
    "our conventions are given in @xcite .",
    "all of our computations are performed in synchronous gauge , @xmath34 where we use our freedom to choose a spatial slicing to ensure that the big crunch occurs everywhere at @xmath35 ( @xmath36 as @xmath37 ) . for a perfect ,",
    "comoving fluid with equation of state @xmath38 , the einstein equations are @xcite :    [ eq : einstein ] @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the ricci tensor on spacelike surfaces , and @xmath41 is defined by    @xmath42    near the big crunch , the dynamics of the metric ( [ eq : synchronous ] ) are _ ultralocal _ @xcite .",
    "that is , the evolution of adjacent spatial points decouples because spatial gradients increase more slowly than other terms in the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , analyzing the dynamics of this metric near the singularity and at fixed spatial coordinate @xmath43 is equivalent to analyzing the much simpler system @xmath44 where the @xmath45 are @xmath46-dependent one - forms that are linearly independent at each point and form a _ homogeneous _ ( but possibly curved ) space such as bianchi type ix @xcite .",
    "the @xmath47 , which do not depend on @xmath46 , describe the ( generally anisotropic ) contraction of this space . both the @xmath45 and the @xmath47",
    "depend on the parameter @xmath43 , the spatial point being studied .",
    "the dynamics of the inhomogeneous universe at a fixed spatial point can be approximated , near @xmath35 , by the dynamics of a homogeneous ( but curved and anisotropic ) universe .",
    "differences in curvature and anisotropy between different @xmath43 are encoded in the different @xmath45 and @xmath47 associated with these points .    in each kasner - like epoch",
    ", we may perform a rotation so that @xmath48 is diagonal . furthermore , we may separate out the trace of @xmath48 and write it as the `` volume scale - factor '' @xmath49 , in analogy to the isotropic friedman - robertson - walker universe , to obtain the metric    @xmath50    [ eq : gen_kasner ]    where the dependence of @xmath49 , the @xmath51 and the @xmath45 on @xmath43 has been suppressed .",
    "the combination @xmath52 can be thought of as the effective scale factor along the @xmath53 direction , and the functions @xmath51 then describe the contraction or expansion of each direction relative to the overall volume contraction .",
    "we may use our freedom to rescale the @xmath54 to ensure that at some time @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "quantities with a subscript zero ( such as @xmath59 ) refer to their values at this fixed time .    the einstein equations ( [ eq : einstein ] ) close with the equation of energy conservation for the fluid , @xmath60 for constant @xmath3",
    ", this equation has the familiar solution , @xmath61 while we could have included several perfect fluids , with different equations of state @xmath62 , the fluid with the largest equation of state will always dominate near the crunch , so it is sufficient to consider only one energy component .",
    "we have taken this fluid to be comoving , because small perturbations of a comoving background are suppressed in a @xmath63 , contracting universe .",
    "in particular , the @xmath64 terms that would appear on the right hand side of ( [ eq : r0a ] ) grow only as @xmath65 , which is slower than the @xmath66 rate at which the diagonal terms grow @xcite .",
    "we first examine the case of ricci flat spatial @xmath67surfaces , for which @xmath68 . in this case",
    ", we write @xmath69 . then , the einstein equations ( [ eq : einstein ] ) reduce to    @xmath70    where a dot indicates a derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath71 .",
    "integration of ( [ eq : mod_einstein_2 ] ) gives , @xmath72 while the constraint ( [ eq : beta_constraint ] ) implies , @xmath73 combining these results , equation ( [ eq : mod_einstein_1 ] ) becomes a friedmann equation , @xmath74 where we define @xmath75 an anisotropic universe has @xmath76 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath77 .",
    "the constant @xmath78 parameterizes the anisotropic contribution to the friedmann equation in ( [ eq : mod_fried ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy evolves as @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "we define the fractional energy densities @xmath81 and @xmath82 as    @xmath83    these quantities represent the contribution of the perfect fluid and anisotropy to the critical density for closure of the universe . since we are neglecting curvature , @xmath84 .",
    "the solution for the @xmath51 as a function of the scale factor @xmath85 is , @xmath86 the limits of integration have been chosen to ensure @xmath87 . for the remainder of the paper , we will assume a universe contracting towards @xmath88 as @xmath71 approaches zero from below .",
    "let us now examine the behavior of these solutions for various @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath89 , the @xmath90 part of the integral ( [ eq : beta_w_of_a ] ) is negligible as @xmath91 , and so the solution converges to the vacuum ( @xmath92 ) kasner universe during contraction ,    @xmath93    [ eq : soln_rho_0 ]    the kasner universe is parameterized by three _ kasner exponents _",
    "@xmath94 , @xmath95 the scale factors in ( [ eq : gen_kasner ] ) are powers of @xmath71 : @xmath96 and the relations ( [ eq : kasner_us_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : kasner_us_2 ] ) become    @xmath97    known as the _ kasner conditions_. these describe the intersection of a plane , the _ kasner plane _ , and a unit sphere , the _ kasner sphere _",
    ", as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kasner ] .",
    "we will denote the intersection , which represents the allowed values of the @xmath94 , as the _ kasner circle_. the outermost circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : kasner ] corresponds to the limit where @xmath9 , as the energy density scales away and only a vacuum , anisotropic universe remains .",
    "there are three degenerate solutions where exactly one of the @xmath94 is one , and the other exponents are zero ( the solid black circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : kasner ] ) . at all other points on the ( dashed )",
    "kasner circle exactly one of the @xmath94 is negative .",
    "thus , although the geometric mean of the three scale factors @xmath98 is contracting , a single scale factor corresponding to the negative kasner exponent is undergoing expansion to infinity .    for the curvature - free case , the universe becomes increasingly anisotropic near the big crunch if @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the isotropic solution , @xmath99 , is inconsistent with the kasner conditions ( [ eq : kasner_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : kasner_2 ] ) .",
    "inspection of ( [ eq : rho_a ] ) reveals that , when @xmath100 , the matter density and the anisotropy terms in the friedmann equation ( [ eq : mod_fried ] ) scale with the same power of @xmath85 , so @xmath81 and @xmath82 remain fixed . the solutions are    @xmath101    this solution is very similar to the @xmath92 case , and indeed we may define the kasner exponents , @xmath102 the kasner conditions are different . if we define @xmath103 then the kasner conditions are    @xmath104    the first condition is unchanged from ( [ eq : kasner_2 ] ) but the right hand side of the second condition has been modified .",
    "increasing @xmath82 corresponds to increasing the radius of the kasner sphere .",
    "the @xmath18 model allows us to explore the behavior of the contracting universe as a function of @xmath82 .",
    "the perfectly isotropic case corresponds to @xmath105 , which is the usual flat friedmann - robertson - walker solution ( innermost circle , in the limit where the circle has shrunk to a point , in fig .",
    "[ fig : kasner ] ) . unlike the vacuum kasner case ,",
    "all of the kasner exponents are positive ( _ i.e. _  lie within the white region of fig .",
    "[ fig : kasner ] ) provided that @xmath106 ( within the larger , solid circle inscribed in the triangle ) .",
    "for this range , none of the scale factors is increasing during the contraction , although they are decreasing at different rates .",
    "when @xmath107 ( third largest circle ) , then some points on the kasner circle have a negative kasner exponent ( dashed part of circle ) and other points may have all positive kasner exponents ( solid , thick parts of circle ) .",
    "thus , ignoring the curvature , the @xmath100 case with non - zero @xmath82 contracts smoothly but anisotropically to the crunch . in the special case where @xmath105 , the contraction is isotropic .      for @xmath1 ,",
    "the energy density dominates ( @xmath108 ) as @xmath91 , and the metric approaches the approximate form    @xmath109,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    [ eq : wg1 ]    where we have chosen the constants of integration so @xmath110 at @xmath111 .",
    "the crucial feature is that the time - varying part of the @xmath51 is proportional to @xmath112 where @xmath113 is _ positive _ if @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the @xmath51 approach a constant and the universe becomes isotropic at the crunch @xcite .",
    "this simple result is a `` no  hair theorem '' for universes without spatial curvature : when @xmath31 , an initially anisotropic universe becomes isotropic ( @xmath114 ) near the big crunch .",
    "the @xmath1 case is stable under anisotropic perturbations . for @xmath89 ,",
    "the universe becomes increasingly anisotropic in the sense that @xmath115 as @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath18 , @xmath82 remains fixed as @xmath88 .",
    "evolution is smooth ( no mixmaster behavior ) in all cases , and is well - approximated as a kasner metric with constant coefficients for sufficiently small @xmath85 .",
    "complex behavior can arise when there is non - zero spatial curvature in a contracting universe .",
    "this may seem surprising at first , since the spatial curvature for a homogeneous and isotropic universe grows as @xmath116 , which increases more slowly than either the anisotropy or the energy density of a component with @xmath117 .",
    "however , we have seen above that the contracting phase for @xmath6 is anisotropic .",
    "we will show below that this can produce rapidly growing curvature perturbations and chaotic behavior . on the other hand",
    ", we will see that chaotic behavior is suppressed if @xmath1 and the contraction approaches isotropy as @xmath118 .",
    "we now allow the @xmath45 to have an @xmath119-dependence and consider a curved manifold .",
    "the spatial ricci tensor for the metric ( [ eq : gen_kasner ] ) has the form @xcite @xmath120 the functions @xmath121 depend only on the @xmath122 and their space derivatives , and are independent of time .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : pab ] ) reveals a crucial connection between the behavior of anisotropy and curvature near the big crunch . in the isotropic limit , @xmath123 and ( [ eq : pab ] )",
    "reduces to the homogeneous and isotropic @xmath116 scaling discussed above",
    ". however , the terms in ( [ eq : pab ] ) are essentially ratios of scale factors .",
    "thus , if the anisotropy is growing as @xmath88 , some terms  involving ratios of expanding and contracting scale factors  will grow , and the corresponding curvature components will scale faster than @xmath116 . for @xmath89",
    "the anisotropy dominates near the crunch , and , as we will discuss below , this causes the curvature to grow and induce chaos .",
    "by contrast , in the @xmath124 model , the anisotropy vanishes at the crunch , and the curvature scales as the usual @xmath116 , which may be neglected .      in this case , we begin by assuming that the behavior near the crunch is described by the vacuum kasner solution , with kasner conditions ( [ eq : kasner_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : kasner_2 ] ) . using the kasner solution ,",
    "it is readily seen that the einstein equation ( [ eq : r00 ] ) contains a leading order term with time dependence @xmath66 .",
    "the second einstein equation ( [ eq : r0a ] ) is a consistency check for our assumption of ultralocality . for an appropriate choice of the @xmath45  a basis for one of the bianchi universes",
    " this equation vanishes identically and the metric ( [ eq : gen_kasner ] ) solves the einstein equations .",
    "the third einstein equation ( [ eq : rab ] ) indicates that the simple kasner solutions must break down near the big crunch .",
    "if we order the kasner exponents as @xmath125 , then the most divergent term in the third einstein equation comes from terms in the spatial curvature ( [ eq : pab ] ) , with leading time dependence , @xmath126 the leading term is more divergent than @xmath66 , since the kasner conditions ( [ eq : kasner_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : kasner_2 ] ) imply @xmath127 is always negative",
    ". therefore , our smoothly contracting solutions are not stable to perturbations in the spatial @xmath67curvature",
    ". a small amount of curvature will grow and come to dominate the dynamics before the big crunch .",
    "the behavior of the universe in this regime has been extensively studied and is known to be chaotic @xcite .",
    "the spatial curvature terms cause the kasner exponents @xmath94 and the principal directions @xmath122 to become time - dependent during contraction .    more precisely , the exponents and principal directions are nearly constant for stretches of kasner - like contraction , during which the curvature is negligible .",
    "these kasner - like epochs are punctuated by short intervals when the curvature momentarily dominates .",
    "the exponents and principal directions suddenly jump to new values , and then a new stretch of kasner - like contraction begins during which the curvature terms are again negligible .",
    "the universe undergoes an infinite number of such jumps before the big crunch . the chaotic , non - integrable evolution is equivalent to that of a billiard ball @xcite , which experiences free motion interrupted by collisions with walls .",
    "models with this oscillatory behavior are called _",
    "chaotic_.    this presents a problem for cosmological models , as one expects curvature perturbations in any realistic universe will cause the local value of the curvature to vary from point to point .",
    "if each spatial point evolves independently and chaotically , the evolution of nearby points diverges very quickly as contraction continues , and the universe rapidly becomes highly inhomogeneous as @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath9 throughout the contracting phase , it seems unlikely that the observed homogeneous universe could emerge from this state after the bounce to an expanding phase @xcite .",
    "the chaotic behavior is mitigated in the @xmath100 case .",
    "recalling our discussion of the curvature - free scenario , it is clear that there are regions of non - zero measure on the kasner circle for which all of the @xmath94 are positive .",
    "we will refer to these points as _",
    "stable_. all choices of @xmath94 when @xmath128 are stable .",
    "if the universe begins at a stable point , the curvature term remains negligible as @xmath88 and the contraction is smoothly kasner - like .",
    "however , when @xmath129 , some choices of the @xmath94 will have one @xmath130 .",
    "if the universe begins at one of these points , the curvature term will grow and become dominant , causing the values of @xmath94 and the principal axes @xmath131 to change .",
    "we refer to these points as _",
    "unstable_. a more complete analysis @xcite reveals that , after a finite number of jumps , the universe hits a point in the open set of stable @xmath94 . from this point",
    "onwards , the universe contracts smoothly and without any further jumps .",
    "we call these models _ non - chaotic _ , since the universe is guaranteed to arrive at a stable point as @xmath91 .",
    "non - chaotic models ( kasner circles ) may contain both stable and unstable points , but they will always oscillate only a finite number of times before arriving in the set of stable points , after which the behavior is integrable .      for @xmath1 , curvature does not affect the contraction .",
    "the key is the time - dependence of the @xmath51 in ( [ eq : wg1 ] ) , which approach zero as a positive power of @xmath71 as @xmath132 .",
    "consequently , the exponential factors @xmath133 in the metric approach constants .",
    "the leading order time - behavior of @xmath40 is simply that of a homogeneous and isotropic universe , @xmath134 this is always less divergent that @xmath66 for @xmath1 .",
    "thus , even in the presence of initial anisotropy and curvature , the solution for @xmath31 converges to the isotropic solution represented by the central point on the kasner sphere in fig .  1 .",
    "we can generalize our cosmic no - hair theorem ( described at the end of section [ sec : nocurv ] ) to include models with spatial curvature .",
    "the einstein equations for a contracting universe with anisotropy and inhomogeneous spatial curvature converge to the friedmann equation for a homogeneous , flat and isotropic universe if it contains energy with @xmath1 , and that for a homogeneous , flat but anisotropic universe if @xmath18 . the @xmath9 case becomes highly inhomogeneous and the no - hair theorem is inapplicable .",
    "in section [ sec : nohair ] , we assumed that the evolution of the universe was dominated by an energy component with fixed equation of state evolving independently of other matter in the universe .",
    "the component could have been a scalar field or a perfect fluid .",
    "we found chaotic behavior for @xmath9 in the presence of curvature but non - chaotic behavior for @xmath0 .    in this section , we want to consider how the behavior for @xmath135 can change if the fluid is imperfect or couples to other components . in many theories , including kaluza - klein , supergravity and superstring models ,",
    "the relevant energy consists of a scalar field that is coupled to @xmath2-forms .",
    "consequently , we will focus on this important example , as others have in the past  @xcite .    to determine the effect of the coupling to @xmath2-forms on chaotic behavior , our approach is similar to our analysis for spatial curvature , where we assume an initial state",
    "in which the spatial curvature is negligible and then check that it remains small .",
    "here we assume that the @xmath2-form field strength is initially negligible and ask how its contribution evolves relative to the energy density with equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "our action is @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the metric , @xmath138 is the scalar curvature , @xmath139 is a potential for the scalar field @xmath13 , @xmath2 is the rank of the @xmath2-form , @xmath140 is the associated field strength tensor and @xmath17 is the coupling constant .",
    "the potential @xmath14 is chosen to give fixed equation of state @xmath0 in the absence a @xmath2-form coupling : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a positive constant . throughout this paper , we assume without loss of generality that @xmath143 as @xmath91 .    for a given equation of state @xmath3 and @xmath2-form rank ,",
    "the behavior of the system as @xmath132 depends on the coupling @xmath17 .",
    "we can extend the terminology introduced earlier to describe the properties for a given @xmath17 .",
    "we classify the @xmath2-form coupling parameter @xmath17 as _ supercritical _ if the @xmath2-form terms grow relative to the scalar field energy density .",
    "we call these models supercritical , as opposed to chaotic , because if @xmath1 it is not known whether chaos occurs or whether the @xmath2-forms merely play a non - negligible role in integrable dynamics . in the special case @xmath18",
    ", chaos is known to occur , and we call these models _ chaotic _ @xcite",
    ". values of @xmath17 for which the contracting solution with negligible @xmath2-forms is stable are called _ non - chaotic _ ( some authors use _ subcritical _ ) .",
    "these two cases are analogous to those introduced in section [ sec : nohair ] .",
    "if @xmath17 is on the boundary between supercritical and non - chaotic , we call @xmath17 _ critical_. the behavior of critical models may be novel , and will be discussed at the end of this section .",
    "we are assuming that initially the spatial curvature , the anisotropy and the @xmath2-form terms are small , and then we check if these conditions are maintained as the universe contracts . since we are considering models where @xmath0 , the model is non - chaotic if the @xmath2-forms are negligible .",
    "the universe may be approximated initially by the homogeneous isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker form in ( [ eq : gen_kasner ] ) with @xmath144 and @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath1 and the @xmath2-form terms are negligible , @xmath145 as the crunch approaches . for @xmath18 , @xmath82 remains small but finite .",
    "if the isotropic case is unstable , then adding anisotropy can not restore stability ; just as in section [ sec : curv ] , the isotropic scale factors are the most stable .    it can be shown that the @xmath2-form terms involving the spatial gradients of @xmath140 grow slower than the leading homogeneous time - derivative terms , another example of the ultralocal behavior discussed previously .",
    "hence , we neglect all spatial derivatives of the field strength .    the components of @xmath140 with purely spatial indices",

    "we know from the study of general kasner universes @xcite that it will exhibit chaotic behavior .",

    "the scalar field describes the volume of the @xmath244  it is a simple example of a moduli field .",
    "as all of our preceding arguments regarding gravitational contraction are local in nature , we expect that the resulting system should be chaotic as well .",
    "however , a free scalar field has equation of state @xmath18 . according to our analysis in section [ sec : nohair ] , one might think that the behavior should be non - chaotic .",
    "what has happened to the chaos ?",
    "the resolution lies in the fact that we have neglected many of the degrees of freedom of the higher  dimensional theory .",
    "a general five dimensional metric @xmath246 can be written , @xmath247 if we neglect the dependence of the metric on the fifth dimension , we may integrate out this dimension and perform a conformal transformation to canonically normalize the four dimensional ricci scalar .",
    "the coefficient @xmath248 is then chosen to canonically normalize the scalar field kinetic energy in the resulting action @xmath249 which describes a vector field coupled to a free scalar and to gravity .",
    "the coupling @xmath250 is outside the stable range for a 1-form in four dimensions .",
    "therefore , the four dimensional theory is chaotic , as we would have guessed , but we have to include the interactions with @xmath2-forms to see that this is so .",
    "next , instead of compactifying the fifth dimension on @xmath244 , let us compactify on the orbifold @xmath245 .",
    "if the coordinate @xmath251 on @xmath244 runs from @xmath252 to @xmath253 , this orbifold can be realized as @xmath244 together with the reflection @xmath254 .",
    "this takes @xmath255 , or equivalently @xmath256 .",
    "thus , the kaluza ",
    "klein zero  mode vector field @xmath257 is absent in the effective action ( [ eq : kkaction ] ) .",
    "the absence of this vector field in the effective action thus implies that the four dimensional theory is no longer chaotic .    while orbifolding suppresses some gauge fields and @xmath2-forms that would cause chaotic behavior , in some models there are additional @xmath2-forms in the bulk .",
    "these @xmath2forms , after dimensional reduction , may themselves lead to chaotic behavior .",
    "an illustrative example is heterotic @xmath5-theory , which includes a three  form field .",
    "the low  energy four dimensional effective action has been evaluated perturbatively by lukas et al @xcite . to zeroth order in the eleven dimensional gravitational coupling @xmath22 ,",
    "it is @xmath258 where we have rescaled the fields in lukas action so the kinetic energies are canonically normalized .",
    "the scalar field @xmath232 is the radion , which governs the brane separation .",
    "the calabi - yau volume modulus @xmath85 and scalar field @xmath54 ( which comes from the eleven dimensional 3-form ) do not couple to @xmath232 , and so can be ignored .",
    "however , the 3-form modulus @xmath259 couples to @xmath232 and the exponent is critical @xmath260 .",
    "hence , the theory does not lead to stable kasner contraction . including the first order ( @xmath261 ) correction to the action does not change the result .",
    "as this theory is critical , it is quite conceivable that higher order corrections will lead to a different behavior during cosmological contraction .",
    "there are a number of kinds of corrections to ( [ eq : mtheory ] ) that could push the theory away from criticality and render it either chaotic or non - chaotic ; but , it is not yet known which behavior occurs .",
    "the new results presented in this paper build on over three decades of preceding research on the behavior of cosmological models contracting to a big crunch .",
    "the classic work focused on cases where the equation of state of the dominant energy component is @xmath33 and @xmath3 is constant .",
    "the essential results in this case are :    * for a perfect fluid with @xmath9 , the contraction is smooth and anisotropic in the absence of curvature and chaotic mixmaster if there is non - zero curvature . * for a perfect fluid with @xmath18 , the contraction is smooth and _ anisotropic _ in the absence of curvature . with curvature ,",
    "the contraction is _ anisotropic _ also , although , depending on the initial anisotropy , the contraction may undergo a finite number of jumps from one kasner - like behavior to another .",
    "* for a free scalar field coupled to @xmath2-forms with coupling @xmath262 , the contraction is _ chaotic mixmaster _ if the coupling @xmath17 is outside a finite interval of non - chaotic @xmath17 .",
    "the _ mixmaster case is non - integrable _ and the _ critical case may be integrable_.    in this paper , we have extended this work to include cases where @xmath1 , a situation that arises naturally in some recent models with a big crunch / big bang transition , such as the cyclic and ekpyrotic models .",
    "we have added the following results :    * for perfect fluid with @xmath1 , the contraction is smooth and converges to _ isotropic _ at the crunch .",
    "the einstein equations converge to ultralocal , homogeneous and isotropic friedmann equations . * for a scalar field coupled to @xmath2-forms , there exists a @xmath21 such that the contraction is smooth and _ isotropic _ for @xmath263 . *",
    "if @xmath3 is time - varying and approaches one from above sufficiently slowly the contraction is _ smooth _ and _ non - chaotic _ , even in the presence of a @xmath2-form with critical equation of state @xmath202 . * in models with an extra dimension , compactification generically produces a scalar field and @xmath2-forms .",
    "@xmath4 orbifolding forces some @xmath2-forms to zero and , thereby , suppresses their contributions to chaos .    in this paper",
    "we have studied how chaotic mixmaster behavior may be suppressed in models involving a big crunch / big bang transition . in particular , the ekpyrotic and cyclic models already include some of the required ingredients including a scalar field with @xmath1 and @xmath4 orbifolding .",
