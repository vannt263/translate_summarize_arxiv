    "elemental cerium is stark example of the complicating effects of magnetism in metals . in principle",
    "a simple system , cerium at room temperature and ambient pressure presents a monatomic bravais lattice ( the face - centered - cubic @xmath3 phase ) .",
    "however , under the application of modest pressures , cerium undergoes a spectacular first - order transition to a low temperature @xmath4 phase .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath3 are isostructural f.c.c",
    ". phases , but differ by @xmath5 in volume , and have markedly different magnetic susceptibilities and resistivities.@xcite there are competing explanations for the transition , which variously invoke a `` kondo volume collapse''@xcite mechanism , a `` mott transition'',@xcite or some entropic mechanism@xcite . in all cases however , it is generally agreed that the large volume @xmath3 phase contains relatively larger localized magnetic moments ( evinced by the higher susceptibility ) and relatively less itinerant electrons ( evinced by the higher resistivity ) . beyond that",
    ", the nature of the transisiton remains contentious .",
    "one of the main complications in the study of cerium is that although the @xmath2 transition occurs on cooling over a wide range of pressures , it is avoided at ambient pressure . in that case ,",
    "an intervening dhcp phase forms from the @xmath3 phase , and transforms into the @xmath4 phase only at lower temperature.@xcite there are commonly two methods used to resolve this problem .",
    "measurements are either performed under pressure on pure cerium , or else the cerium is alloyed with other elements known to suppress the dhcp phase ( typically thorium ) .",
    "results from these two avenues of investigation are not always consistent - for example , it has been claimed that the phonon entropy plays little role in the @xmath2 transition in a ce@xmath6th@xmath1 alloy,@xcite while studies on pure cerium under pressure have returned the opposite result.@xcite nevertheless , the alloying of cerium has generated a family of related compounds , in which the order of the transition , the magnitude of the volume collapse , and the transition temperature can be smoothly varied.@xcite    one such alloy , ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 , is of particular interest in regards to spin - lattice coupling at the phase transition .",
    "alloying with thorium suppresses the dhcp phase , while alloying with lanthanum causes the transition to become continuous and supresses the critical temperature.@xcite it has been reported that cooling ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 in high magnetic fields can suppress the resistivity change associated with the volume collapse to lower temperature , and that the application of pulsed magnetic fields can induce a large moment below the critical temperature.@xcite these measurements map out a phase boundary for the @xmath2 transition as a function of magnetic field , and suggest that the volume collapse can be fully suppressed by @xmath7 tesla . here",
    "we report a direct study of the structure of ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 , using synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction in pulsed magnetic fields as high as 28 tesla .",
    "lattice parameter and structural correlation length are extracted throughout the @xmath8 phase diagram .",
    "samples of ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 were prepared at los alamos by arc - melting elemental cerium , lanthanum and thorium in a zirconium gettered argon atmosphere . the button was melted and flipped 15 times to ensure mixing .",
    "the final melt was cooled in a round - bottomed trough , which was 5 mm wide .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 25 mm long sample was unidirectionally rolled @xmath9 10 times to achieve a finished thickness of 50 microns .",
    "a section of the as - rolled material was heat treated at 450@xmath10c for 1 hour to remove the rolling texture before a final sample , 2 mm in diameter , was cut from the sheet with a razor blade .",
    "the sample was subsequently mounted inside a blind hole in a sapphire bracket , and sealed with a sapphire cap and stycast epoxy , to ensure good thermal contact and prevent oxidization .",
    "the sapphire bracket was anchored to the cold finger of the double - funnel solenoid pulsed magnet at the advanced photon source ( aps ) , which facilitates diffraction at up to 22@xmath11 of scattering angle , to temperatures as low as @xmath12 k and in magnetic fields as high as @xmath9 30 tesla.@xcite this system features a resistive magnet coil ( of tohoku design ) in a liquid nitrogen bath , connected to a 40 kj capacitor bank .",
    "the bank is capable of discharging a 3 kv charge through the coil in a @xmath13 ms half - sine wave pulse , generating a peak current of @xmath14 ka and a peak magnetic field of @xmath15 tesla .",
    "the heat generated in the resistive coil during a pulse must be allowed to dissipate before the system can be pulsed again . at peak field values",
    ", this requires a wait time @xmath16 8 minutes between pulses .",
    "the sample to be studied is both thermally and vibrationally isolated from the coil .",
    "this new instrument offers a complementary measurement geometry to the aps split - pair pulsed magnet developed previously.@xcite     14.9 tesla , integrated over @xmath17 0.5 tesla for the exposure .",

    "the monochromator was detuned so as to reduce higher harmonic contamination .",
    "the incident beam size was defined by slits , with an illuminated area on sample of 0.2 mm x 1.0 mm .",
    "a @xmath19 ms pulse of x - rays was defined using a pair of fast platinum shutters , and the arrival of this pulse at the sample was synchronized with the peak of the magnetic field pulse .",
    "scattered x - rays were recorded on a two - dimensional image plate detector . in this configuration ,",
    "our system is similar to the pulsed magnet instrument in operation at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf).@xcite to calibrate our instrument , we repeated the measurements@xcite of detlefs _ et al .",
    "_ on polycrystalline tbvo@xmath20 in pulsed magnetic fields , as previously measured by the esrf instrument.@xcite we reproduced the reported high field peak splitting in the tetragonal phase of tbvo@xmath20,@xcite validating our measurement scheme.@xcite we performed our measurements of ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 with the axis of the solenoid coincident with the incident beam , and the detector positioned so as to capture the majority of the solenoid exit window . in this way , at 30 kev the first two powder rings ( corresponding to the @xmath21111@xmath22 and @xmath21200@xmath22 peaks ) are completely captured by the detector , allowing a full radial integration and excellent counting statistics even for a single 1 ms exposure . the current through the solenoid and the x - ray flux incident on the sample were monitored as a function of time by tracing the output of a high - resolution current monitor and an air - filled ion chamber on a digital storage oscilloscope .",

    "1 , along with data from a single exposure on the image plate . in order to extract the correlation length and lattice parameter from these diffraction patterns ,",
    "each of the two lowest lying peaks was fit individually , generating two independent sets of data , which were subsequently compared . in all cases , the properties extracted from the two peaks aggreed within the errorbars of the measurement , and the quantities quoted in the following are the average of the two",
    "powder diffraction patterns at room temperature show a single phase material , with symmetry and lattice constant consistent with the @xmath3 phase of ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 . on cooling , we observe the first two bragg peaks to shift to higher @xmath18 , while also broadening by a factor of @xmath23 and exhibiting a reduction in peak intensity ( see fig .",
    "this is consistent with a collapse in volume , accompanied by a striking reduction in the structural correlation length .",
    "it is interesting to note that we observe a single phase at all temperatures , in contrast to recent neutron diffraction measurements on ce@xmath6th@xmath1 which reported a coexistence of both the @xmath4 and @xmath3 phases over a wide range of temperatures.@xcite our sample was initially cooled directly to 8k to characterize the magnitude of the volume collapse , then warmed to 250 k while collecting data .",
    "the volume was observed to approach the @xmath3 phase value quite gradually .",
    "next we cooled slowly and measured the lattice parameters with a fine point density .",
    "the resulting continuous but hysteretic volume collapse curves are plotted in fig .",

    "sample was warmed from 8 k to 250 k ( @xmath24 ) , then cooled back to 10 k ( @xmath25 ) . this thermal cycling lead to a reduction in the magnitude of the volume collapse , shown by the dashed lines .",
    "the inset shows the ornstein - zernike correlation length extracted from the cooling measurements ( see text ) .",
    "the correlated regions of the collapsed phase have average size of only @xmath26 nm.,width=321 ]    the observed peak broadening can be modelled phenomenologically , by assuming that the high temperature patterns show long - range ordered and resolution limited scattering , while the low temperature broadening arises from a reduction in the ornstein - zernike correlation length .",
    "our high temperature peaks are well described by gaussians , and we are assuming a lorentzian form for the scattering function ( see ref . [ ] for details ) .",
    "therefore , the measured scattering at low temperature should be well described by the convolution of a lorentzian and a gaussian - a voigt function .",
    "since the width of this voigt function is related to the width of the gaussian ( the resolution ) and the width of the lorentzian ( the inverse correlation length ) , the numerically extracted fullwidth of the bragg peaks can be converted to a resolution - deconvoluted correlation length .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "2 demontrate the degree of agreement between these lineshapes and the measured data , and the extracted correlation length is plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "our resolution limit is found to be on the order of a few microns , however , the low temperature collapsed phase exhibits correlation lengths which are roughly two orders of magnitude shorter than this .",
    "below @xmath9 30 k , the @xmath4 phase correlations are seen to extend over an average range of @xmath9 20 nm .",
    "since our alloy is @xmath9 80@xmath27 cerium , the mean distance between dopant atoms ( either lanthanum or thorium ) is on the order of 2 nm .",
    "thus , while the inclusion of lanthanum and thorium in the alloy does not completely hinder the formation of the @xmath4 phase , and each correlated region on average contains multiple dopant atoms , nevertheless these atoms act to strongly disorder the sample at the nanoscale within the @xmath4 phase .",
    "conversely , within the @xmath3 phase , individual grains are well correlated over micron - sized regions despite the same level of chemical disorder .",
    "motivated by the results of ref .",
    "[ ] , we next sought to characterize the effect of applied magnetic field on the volume collapse transition in ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 . currently , the available capacitance at the aps limits our measurements to applied magnetic fields @xmath28 30 tesla , well below the 56 tesla estimated to fully suppress the @xmath2 transition to zero kelvin.@xcite however , inspection of the resistivity measurements of ref .",
    "[ ] reveals that our highest achievable magnetic fields should be sufficient to suppress the temperature of the volume collapse inflection point by @xmath9 8 k. we can maximize our sensitivity to this effect by cooling to the inflection point of the volume collapse ( @xmath9 35 k ) and pulsing to high magnetic field .",
    "the slope of @xmath29 is large at this temperature , and therefore an 8 k shift in the inflection point should cause a @xmath9 0.7 @xmath27 change in volume at 35 k , well within our resolution .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "4 , we failed to observe this effect .",
    "after cooling to 35 k , we collected five diffraction patterns at zero field , which served to define the zero field bragg peak positions to an accuracy better than @xmath30 . next , we collected ten patterns in pulsed field , with the average applied field over the x - ray exposure being @xmath31 tesla .",
    "we observed no measurable change in the bragg peak positions in any individual pattern . nor did we observe any cumulative effect from multiple high - field pulses .",
    "our measurements therefore constrain any volume changes at ( 35 k , 28 t ) to be less than @xmath9 0.07 @xmath27 , a full order of magnitude smaller than what would be expected.@xcite    111@xmath22 bragg peak at t=35 k. there is no discernable change in the position or width of the peak .",
    "the expected curve is calculated based on the position and width change that would arise from an 8 k shift in the transition temperature , consistent with the results of ref .",
    "[ ] .,width=321 ]    ) and ornstein - zernike correlation length ( @xmath32 ) , comparing zero field cooled measurements and measurements where the system is repeatedly pulsed to 28 t on cooling .",
    "no field effect is seen.,width=321 ]    it is important to remember that the evidence for field induced suppression of the volume collapse in ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 for magnetic fields below 30 tesla comes from resistivity curves , measured by cooling in constant applied magnetic fields .",
    "this is procedurally distinct from the zero - field - cooled pulsed measurements reported here .",
    "discrepancy between field - cooled and zero - field - cooled behaviour is a hallmark of spin glass materials , wherein chemical disorder and competing interactions collude to freeze in disordered ground states.@xcite we have already shown that chemical disorder in our alloy has a strong effect on the development of @xmath4-phase correlations ( see fig .",
    "it is therefore tempting to sugest that there may be some glassy behavior at play in ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 .",
    "direct comparison between field cooled and zero field cooled measurements are therefore highly desirable , however , a truly field - cooled measurement is not achievable with pulsed magnets . we have attempted to approximate one by slow cooling , and pulsing in regular intervals . in order to minimize the obscuring effects of thermal cycling , we performed two identical cooling curves , one after the other , warming to 280 k once to reset the system .",
    "for each of these measurements , we cooled at a controlled rate of 1 k@xmath33min from 280 k. during the first of these cooldowns , we pulsed to 28 t at 10 min ( 10 k ) intervals . during the second cooldown",
    ", we collected zero - field data in the same manner , albeit more frequently since there was no need to wait for the coil to cool down .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "5 . clearly",
    ", magnetic fields applied in this way are no more effective at suppressing the volume collapse than the zero - field - cooled methods shown in fig .",
    "4 .    we are therefore forced to conclude that the available magnetic fields were insufficient to induce any structural effects in ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 . if the @xmath2 transition were continuous for this alloy ( as claimed in ref . [ ] ) , and the magnetic field induced suppression occured as claimed in ref . [ ] , then we would have expected to see a clear shift in @xmath18 as denoted in fig .",
    "4 for the zero - field - cooled measurements , and a clear suppression in temperature should have occurred for the repetitively pulsed measurements reported in fig .",
    "conversely , if the @xmath2 transition were first order for this alloy ( as claimed in ref .",
    "[ ] ) , then our measurements imply that the phase boundary was never crossed in our cooling curve . this would require a steeper increase of the critical field on lowering temperature than was reported in ref . [ .",
    "] it is also possible that the alloy is dynamically inhibited on the timescale of the magnetic field pulse , which would be consistent with a glassy behavior . finally , it is possible that the effects reported in ref .",
    "[ ] were not intrinsic to ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 .",
    "clearly , the issue of field induced suppression of the @xmath2 transition requires further investigation in elemental cerium and its alloys .",
    "as has been noted in the preceeding sections , we have observed a detrimental effect due to thermal cycling . our initial measurements on as - grown samples revealed well - correlated grains on the order of microns in size .",
    "on first cooling , the volume collapsed @xmath4 phase was seen to exhibit nanoscale disorder , and on second cooling the absolute size of the volume collapse had diminished ( see fig . 3 and discussion in section iii ) .",
    "over the course of our week - long experiment , we observed the @xmath4-phase volume to gradually increase with each thermal cycling , while the @xmath3-phase volume was seen to gradually decrease .",
    "in addition , while the @xmath4-phase consistently showed nanoscale disorder with correlation lengths of @xmath9 20 nm , the @xmath3 phase correlations were observed to shrink , from micron - sized grains in the as - grown sample to correlation lengths of only @xmath9 150 nm after 11 thermal cycles .",
    "zero - field cooling curves from the second , seventh , and eleventh cycle are plotted in fig .",
    "6 , to illustrate the effect .",
    "it is likely that the strains associated with the large volume change and spatial variations in doping,@xcite which are manifest in the @xmath4-phase disorder , act to introduce new domain boundaries at low temperature , which thereafter persist as defects .",
    "this effect is insidious , since the suppression by thermal cycling we observe here could easily be mistaken for suppression by an external perturbation , if that perturbation was varied monotonically during the course of an experiment .",
    "hypothetically , had we measured cooling curves through the volume collapse in dc magnetic fields which were monotomically increased during the course of our measurements , we may easily have misinterpreted the gradual buildup of thermal cycling damage as a magnetic field induced effect .",
    "therefore , it is important to take extra care when mapping out phase diagrams in cerium alloys .",
    "more generally , these measurements highlight the need for careful consideration of strain driven effects in all materials studies , which can often obfuscate results .     transition .",
    "the effects are clear in both the magnitude of the volume collapse ( @xmath34 ) and the ornstein - zernike correlation length ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "all data was collected on cooling in zero magnetic field .",
    "the three data sets represent the second ( @xmath25 ) , seventh ( @xmath24 ) , and eleventh ( @xmath35 ) thermal cycle.,width=321 ]",
    "in this article , we have reported a synchrotron x - ray diffraction study of the volume collapse transition in ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 , as a function of temperature and pulsed magnetic field . in this alloy ,",
    "the @xmath2 transition is smooth but hysteretic , characterized by a @xmath36 volume change and a dramatic reduction in structural correlation length .",
    "the collapsed @xmath4 phase is shown to be unaffected by pulsed magnetic fields @xmath28 28 tesla , both in zero - field cooled conditions and under repetitive pulsing on cooling .",
    "it is suggested that a deviation between truly field cooled and zero field cooled behavior in ce@xmath0la@xmath1th@xmath1 may account for the disagreement between our measurements and previous bulk studies.@xcite this implies a glassy character to the low temperature phase .",
    "we have also shown that repeated thermal cycling through the @xmath2 transition acts to disorder the sample on nanometer length scales , while suppressing the magnitude of the volume collapse transition .",
    "these measurements may constitute a microscopic measure of what has been generally refered to as `` sluggish dynamics '' in cerium alloys.@xcite    it is our hope that these results will advance understanding of the exotic @xmath2 transition in elemental cerium and its alloys .",
