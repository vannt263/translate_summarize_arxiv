    "in 1824 the french physicist nicolas lonard sadi carnot , better known as sadi carnot , in `` reflections on the motive power of fire '' settled the principles of the modern theory of thermodynamics by pointing out that motive power ( concept later identified as work ) is due to the fall of caloric ( concept later identified as heat ) from a hot to cold body ( working substance ) .",
    "these ideas , that provided the scientific support for the technological jump based in the steam engine were not well understood at that time . they were actually discovered and further elaborated thirty years later by the german rudolf clausius and the british william thomson ( lord kelvin ) .",
    "the fundamental principles ruling the operation of the thermal engines were then summarized in the two basic laws of thermodynamics . while the first law simply stresses the conservation of the energy , the second one deals with the subtle distinction between a kind of energy that can be used and another one that is dissipated in a physical process , as well as on the balance between both of them .    in 1851",
    "lord kelvin also discovered thomson effect , and showed that it was related to other thermoelectric phenomena : peltier and seebeck effects . unlike carnot s machines , these effects are related to non - equilibrium processes .",
    "however , they also bring about the conceptual distinction between different kinds of energies : one that is transported in some direction due to a voltage or temperature gradient , but being different from the joule heating in the sense that the first one is reversible while the latter involves dissipation and , thus , irreversible effects .    nowadays , we are witnessing a technological trend towards an increasing miniaturization of the electronic components .",
    "this is accompanied by a significant activity within communities of the basic sciences , in the search of a better understanding of the behavior of materials and devices with sizes in the range between @xmath0 to @xmath1 as fundamental pieces of electronic circuits .",
    "paradigmatic examples are the quantum dots fabricated in the interfaces of semiconductor structures where confining gates for electrons and circuits are printed by means of nanolitography within an area of a few @xmath2 ( see fig . [ dots ] ) . due to the small scale of these systems",
    ", they present some physical features that resemble the molecules .",
    "in particular , the landscape of their spectra contains well defined quantum levels where electrons propagate almost perfectly preserving the phase of their wave functions .",
    "however , they are not isolated from the external world but coupled to the substrate , gates , wires and external fields that induce the transport of electrons .",
    "for this reason , they are classified as `` open quantum systems '' that operate out - of - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the `` external world '' , instead , contains pieces that act as macroscopic reservoirs with which the `` small quantum systems '' exchange particles and energy . due to the mixed nature of these systems",
    ", the concepts of classical electrodynamics and thermodynamics can not be simply applied to them and theoretical tools that are amenable to capture their quantum properties as well as the coupling to their environment are necessary .",
    "quantum dots fabricated with nanolitography in a semiconductor interface .",
    "the two leads going upwards and downwards make the contact between the dot and external reservoirs .",
    "the gate at the left can be used to apply a voltage to introduce a rigid shift of the positions of the energy levels of the dot .",
    "the two extra leads connected at the right hand wall of the dot can be used to apply ac potentials at those points .",
    "figure by charles marcus , mesoscopic lab , harvard university . ]    in this chapter we focus in a particular kind of devices named `` quantum pumps '' .",
    "they have been realized experimentally , precisely , in quantum dots , where ac voltages are applied at their walls , and a current with a dc component is generated in the absence of a stationary voltage difference ( see figure 1 ) . from the theoretical point of view one of the interests in these systems",
    "is that they can be described in terms of simple hamiltonians , including macroscopic pieces that represent the wires connected to the quantum dot as well as explicit terms for the time dependent forces that induce the transport process .",
    "the latter feature makes an important difference , in comparison with setups where the transport is induced by means of a stationary voltage difference .",
    "this is because in such systems the work of the forces that keep such a bias fixed is not explicitly taken into account in the model hamiltonian but introduced as a boundary condition .",
    "we can imagine situations in which the macroscopic wires connected at the quantum dot are at different temperatures .",
    "additionally , the time dependent forces do make work on the system .",
    "thus , we can regard the quantum pump as a microscopic engine where heat can be exchanged between two sources at different temperatures , while work is provided to the system and part of the energy is dissipated . as we will show , such an engine could even operate as a refrigerator , where there is a net heat flow from the reservoir at the lowest temperature to the one at the highest one .",
    "the goal of this chapter is to introduce theoretical tools for the analysis of the fundamental conservation laws at the microscopic scale , the explicit evaluation of the power developed by the intervening forces and the distinction between reversible flows and dissipated energy .",
    "this chapter is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce a simple microscopic model for a quantum pump and we will discuss the fundamental principle of the conservation of the charge and the energy in this device . in section iii",
    "we introduce the basics of two well established many - body techniques to treat quantum transport in harmonically time - dependent systems .",
    "the first one starts from the explicit microscopic hamiltonian for the system , forces and environment which is solved by recourse to non - equilibrium green s functions . while the second one is based in the notion of scattering processes that the electrons experience as they cross through a quantum system under ac driving .",
    "although this chapter is self - contained , we will not include a complete tutorial on these two techniques but we adopt a practical point of view , presenting just the main ideas while we defer the reader to more specific literature on many - body techniques for further details . in section",
    "iv we present explicit expressions for the energy flows in terms of the green s functions and the scattering matrix elements introduced in section iii .",
    "we also discus the nature of the different components contributing to the total energy flow .",
    "section v is devoted to a summary of the different operating modes that we were able to identify in our quantum engine . finally , in section",
    "vi we conclude with a discussion of the possible directions to extend these ideas .",
    "sketch of the setup .",
    "the central system is connected two two infinite wires , which play the role of macroscopic reservoirs . in this example",
    ", the central system contains a profile of two barriers at which ac fields that oscillate with the same amplitude @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 , and a phase lag @xmath5 . ]",
    "we start by defining explicit hamiltonians to describe the quantum electronic system as well as its environment . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "let us focus in a system like the one sketched in fig [ fig1 ] where the central system @xmath6 , on which the time - dependent forces are acting , is placed between two wires : one located at the left ( @xmath7 ) and the other at the right ( @xmath8 ) of @xmath6 .",
    "we can identify @xmath6 with the quantum dot of fig .",
    "[ dots ] , with the two ac voltages applied at the two extra leads connected at the wall .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 reservoirs of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] correspond to the up and down ones in fig .",
    "[ dots ] .    along this chapter , we make the following simplifying assumptions on the system : ( i ) we shall take into account only the two wires as the external environment for the central system and disregard other effects like , for example , the influence of the phonons of the substrate . such a simplification is expected to be reasonable if we concentrate on the behavior at sufficiently low temperatures . ( ii )",
    "we also assume that the electrons do not experience any kind of many - body interactions , like the coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "this assumption is justified in the description of the metallic wires where we can expect an efficient screening but it is justified within the system @xmath6 only when the structure is strongly connected to the wires and allows for the screening of the wires to penetrate into it . in this context , the spin degrees of freedom of the electrons behave independently of one another . for this reason , in order to simplify the notation , we do not consider them explicitly . in the case of considering them",
    "we must simply write a factor @xmath9 in front of the final expressions for the currents and densities .",
    "the full hamiltonian reads : @xmath10 where @xmath11 being @xmath12 , are hamiltonians of free spinless electrons that represent the wires .",
    "we stress that these systems are macroscopic , i.e. they contain a very large number of degrees of freedom and are in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this means that they are completely characterized by their density of states @xmath13 and the fermi distribution function : @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the second term , @xmath16 , describes the quantum structure under consideration as well as the time - dependent gate potentials acting on it .",
    "the ensuing hamiltonian depends on the geometry of the structure as well as on the interactions that we want to take into account . in the absence of many - body interactions",
    ", this system may be described by a single - particle hamiltonian of the form : @xmath17 being @xmath18 the mass of an electron , which corresponds to a finite number of time - dependent potentials that we assume have the simple single - harmonic dependence : @xmath19 .",
    "the potential @xmath20 contains the information of the confining walls , barriers and defects of the structure . for a detailed discussion of the conservation laws and for treating the problem with the green s function formalism , it is convenient to express this hamiltonian in second quantization . to this end",
    "we must define an appropriate single particle basis to represent the relevant operators . as the structure under study occupies a reduced region of the space ,",
    "it is comfortable to work with a single particle basis that is labeled by spacial coordinates , like that defined by the wannier functions .",
    "it is , thus , useful to work on a discrete lattice containing a finite number ( @xmath21 ) of sites and a basis of single - electron states that are localized on the lattice positions .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian in second quantization corresponds to a tight - binding model . for simplicity",
    ", we consider this model in one - dimension ( 1d ) , although this is not an essential assumption : @xmath22 c^{\\dagger}_l c_l   -w \\sum_{l=1}^{n-1 }   ( c^{\\dagger}_l c_{l+1 } + h.c)\\,,\\ ] ] where the term with @xmath23 , being @xmath24 single - electron basis state localized at the lattice position `` @xmath25 '' , describes the kinetic energy of the electrons through jumping processes between nearest - neighbor sites of the underlying lattice .",
    "the term with @xmath26 , defines a static energy profile for the structure : it contains the information of the existence of barriers and wells . for a system with impurities",
    ", this profile can be defined in terms of a random amplitude and this model reduces to the anderson model .",
    "the term with @xmath27 represents the time dependent gates , being finite at the @xmath28 pumping centers and vanishing otherwise .",
    "finally , the term @xmath29 describes the contacts between the central system and the reservoirs . in our simple 1d model for the central structure",
    "the @xmath7 lead is connected to the first site , @xmath30 , and the @xmath8 to the last site , @xmath31 , of the central structure .",
    "the hamiltonian reads : @xmath32 which describes hopping processes between the states @xmath33 within the wires and the points of @xmath6 at which the contact between the two systems is established .    before closing this subsection ,",
    "let us mention that , depending on the physical problem under consideration , there may be other time - dependent terms in the hamiltonian . for systems with ac voltages applied at the @xmath7 and @xmath8 wires , we should consider a dispersion relation with a time - dependent component in addition to the static one , @xmath34 . by recourse to a gauge transformation",
    ", it can be seen that this type of ac voltages can , equivalently , be included in a time - dependent phase in the contact hopping @xmath35 ( see jauho et al .",
    "another possible time - dependent term is that originated by an electric field derived from a time - dependent vector potential @xmath36 ( see arrachea 2002 ) . that physical situation would take place , for example , when the central system is bended and closed into an annular geometry threaded by a time - dependent magnetic flux . in terms of the hamiltonian",
    "this introduces a shift : @xmath37 in the momentum of the electrons , being @xmath38 the velocity of light . in the tight - binding basis",
    "this translates into time - dependent phases in the hopping parameter @xmath39 of @xmath40 along with the periodic boundary condition @xmath41 .",
    "finally , the study of the coupling to external classical radiation fields is usually treated within the so called dipolar approximation , which in our second quantization language results in a diagonal voltage profile @xmath42 as in eq.([hc2 ] ) with @xmath43 , with @xmath3 constant and @xmath44 ( see kohler et al .",
    "2005 ) .        a consistent way to define expressions for the electronic currents along the different pieces of the structure is starting from the evolution of the electronic density @xmath45 .",
    "the variation of @xmath46 is due to the difference between the charge flow exiting and entering the infinitesimal volume that encloses that point : @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the current exiting the site @xmath25 towards the neighboring site @xmath49 .",
    "we denote with a positive sign the flows pointing from left to right . the variation in time of the local charge",
    "can be calculated within the heisenberg picture by recourse to the eherenfest theorem : @xmath50 \\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] thus , the explicit evaluation of the above commutator defines an explicit expression for the current .",
    "if we consider a site within @xmath6 we obtain : @xmath51 it is easy to verify that the above expression coincides with the mean value of the operator @xmath52 , being @xmath53 the velocity expressed in second quantization in the basis of localized functions . similarly , if we consider the contact between @xmath6 and one of the reservoirs we get the following expression for the current that exits the reservoir @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "analysis of the energy balance in our setup .",
    "the dashed boxes enclose the elementary volume of the system where the evolution of the energy is studied .",
    "it contains two sites of the underlying lattice .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction that we have defined as positive for energy currents along the different pieces of the system as well as the powers done by the fields . ]    in order to define energy currents , we proceed along a similar line as before . in this case",
    ", we analyze the evolution of the energy density at a given elementary volume and write the equation of the conservation of the energy . as our hamiltonian @xmath40 contains terms involving positions up to nearest - neighbors ,",
    "the smallest volume for analyzing the evolution of the energy density in our 1d lattice is that enclosed by a box confining a bond of nearest - neighbor sites ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "if we denote by @xmath58 the total energy stored within such a box , the equation for the conservation of the energy reads : @xmath59 where the first two terms denotes the difference between outgoing ( from @xmath49 to @xmath60 ) and incoming ( from @xmath61 to @xmath25 ) flows , with the same sign convention as in the case of charge flows , while the last two terms denote the power done by the external fields , which are defined as positive when it is provided by the forces .",
    "the latter terms vanish if the time - dependent gate potentials are not acting at the points @xmath25 and @xmath49 enclosed by the box .",
    "our box can also enclose the contact bond between the reservoir @xmath54 and the central system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , in which case we get : @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the energy flow that exits the reservoir @xmath54 .",
    "as in the previous subsection , the explicit expressions for the flows and powers are derived by recourse to the eherenfest theorem : @xmath64 \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   e \\frac{d v_l(t )   } { d t } \\langle   c^{\\dagger}_l(t )",

    ", we obtain the explicit expressions for the energy currents : @xmath66\\ , ,   \\label{jel } \\\\",
    "j^e_{\\alpha}(t ) & = & \\frac{i w_{c\\alpha } } { \\hbar } \\sum_{k \\alpha}\\varepsilon_{k \\alpha }   \\langle c^{\\dagger}_{k \\alpha}(t ) c_{l \\alpha}(t ) - c^{\\dagger}_{l \\alpha}(t ) c_{k \\alpha } ( t ) \\rangle\\ , , \\label{jeal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and power developed by the ac voltages : @xmath67      in the absence of sinks and sources , the average of the charge enclosed by any volume of the sample over one cycle with of period @xmath68 must remain constant , which defines the following continuity equation for the dc charge current ( microscopic kirchoff law ) : @xmath69 for arbitrary @xmath70 along @xmath6 , where we denote @xmath71 .",
    "analogously , for any volume enclosing lattice points running from @xmath72 we get : @xmath73 where the last term defines the power done by all the voltages enclosed by the volume .",
    "the above equation reduces to a `` kirchoff law '' for the dc energy current when we enclose a region that is free from the time - dependent voltages , in which case the last term vanishes .      at this point",
    ", it is important to mention that the dc energy current @xmath74 defined above does not necessarily coincide with the heat current which we will denote @xmath75 .",
    "this is because what is understood as `` heat '' is usually the energy transferred from one system to another as a consequence of a temperature difference .",
    "in order to understand this difference , let us consider that our reservoirs are at temperature @xmath76 , let us place our volume enclosing the contact between one reservoir and the central system and let us assume that we are not enclosing an ac local voltage within it .",
    "now , let us analyze the following picture based on heuristic arguments that we shall better formalize it in subsequent sections .",
    "let us assume that the ac voltages are so weak in amplitude and oscillate with such a low frequency that we can disregard the power they develop .",
    "let us assume that , anyway , they are able to move a small portion of electrons with energies very close to the fermi energy of the reservoirs @xmath77 , that we recall is the same for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this weak motion give place to currents of particles and energy which , from the definitions ( [ jal ] ) and ( [ jeal ] ) , are approximately related through @xmath78 .",
    "the same relation holds for @xmath7 as well as @xmath8 reservoirs and a small current of particles may translate in a large current of energy , since @xmath77 can be large .",
    "the dc component of the charge current may be finite and should be positive in one reservoir and negative in the other one , indicating that there is a net flow of charge between @xmath7 and @xmath8 or vice versa .",
    "the above relation , therefore , tells us that there is a concomitant net flow of energy from a reservoir to the other one , in spite of the fact that we are assuming that both reservoirs are at zero temperature . one",
    "could complain that we have not taken into account the power done by the time - dependent fields which would tend to heat the system .",
    "however , let us recall that an appropriate choice of @xmath77 would allow us an arbitrary large value of the energy flow , against which we can disregard a contribution like ( [ power ] ) for weak and slow ac voltages . in summary ,",
    "the above considerations lead us to conclude that there may exist a net energy flow which can not be identified as `` heat '' but has rather a convective nature . in order to better quantify heat",
    ", it is thus natural to subtract from the energy flow , the convective component @xmath79 , i.e. : @xmath80 notice that , while the convective term is constant along all the pieces of the system due to the continuity of the charge , the heat and energy currents may have different values due to the contribution of the power done by the external voltages , see eq.([conten ] ) .    to give a more formal definition of the heat flow @xmath81 ,",
    "let us consider the particle and the energy balances for a given reservoir @xmath54 that is kept at fixed both the chemical potential @xmath82 and the temperature @xmath83 .",
    "if the charge current @xmath84 and the energy flow @xmath85 enter the reservoir @xmath54 , then the number of particles and the energy of a reservoir should change .",
    "this , in turn , would change the chemical potential and the temperature of a reservoir . in order to keep @xmath82 fixed",
    ", the electrons have to be removed with the rate @xmath86 out of the reservoir .",
    "therefore , while keeping @xmath82 constant we necessarily remove energy with rate @xmath87 .",
    "we stress that the convective energy @xmath87 is taken out at equilibrium conditions , therefore , it can be reversibly given back .",
    "in general this energy does not coincide with energy flow @xmath85 entering the reservoir . to prevent heating of reservoir one",
    "needs additionally to take out the energy with rate @xmath88 without taking out particles . since the reservoir can not produce work , the only way to remove the remaining energy is to put it in contact with other large body playing the role of a thermostat .",
    "the energy exchange between the reservoir @xmath54 and the thermostat is essentially irreversible .",
    "for this reason we interpret this part of the total energy as `` heat '' and we identify @xmath81 as the heat flow . if the thermostat would be absent the temperature of a reservoir would change . as we will show @xmath81",
    "can be directed either to the reservoir from the central system or back .",
    "hence , in the absence of a thermostat , the reservoir can be either heated or cooled .",
    "we stress that the energy transported at the rate @xmath81 becomes `` heat '' only deep inside the macroscopic reservoir , where the electrons scattered by the dynamical central system , are able to equilibrate .",
    "in this section we briefly review the many - body techniques to evaluate the currents and powers defined in the previous section .",
    "the expectation value of any one - body observable , @xmath89 , can be regarded as follows : @xmath90 being @xmath91 a `` lesser '' green s function .",
    "our goal , now , is to derive equations for the evolution of this green s function and strategies to solve them .",
    "the formal theory of non - equilibrium green s function has been developed independently by kadanoff and baym [ kadanoff and baym 1959 ] , schwinger [ schwinger 1961 ] and keldysh [ keldysh 1962 ] .",
    "the structure of that theory is very similar to the one of causal green s functions at zero temperature ( see mahan 1990 ) , except for the fact that in non - equilibrium situations , the assumption that the state of the system at time @xmath92 differs just in a phase from the state in @xmath93 does not longer holds . the way to overcome",
    "this inconvenience is to define the evolution along a special contour @xmath94 that defines a round trip , first going from @xmath93 to @xmath92 and then going back to @xmath93 . as in equilibrium problems ,",
    "the precise description of that evolution can be accomplished with the help of wick s theorem and feynman diagrams and one of the big powers of this technique is the possibility of treating many - body interactions in a systematic way .",
    "we skip here the technical just highlighting the main ideas leading to some useful identities , and we defer the reader to more specialized literature ( see mahan 1990 , haug and jauho 1996 , caroli et al .",
    "1971 , pastawski 1992 , jauho et al . 1994 ) . instead of the time - ordering operator used in the equilibrium theory ,",
    "it is convenient to work with contour - ordered green s functions : @xmath95 \\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is a schematic notation that labels the electronic degrees of freedom and time in the same index and the operator @xmath97 denotes time - ordering along a contour that begins in @xmath93 evolves to @xmath92 ( @xmath98 ) and then turns back from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this function corresponds to the casual `` time - ordered '' , the `` lesser '' , the `` anti - time - ordered '' or `` greater '' function depending on the position of the two times along the closed time - contour : @xmath100 with : @xmath101 which are not independent functions , but satisfy : @xmath102 .",

    "the evolution of this green s function is given by dyson s equation , which for a one - body hamiltonian reads : @xmath109 notice that the above equation actually represents a matricial integral equation if we distinguish the positions of the times as in ( [ greenc ] ) .",
    "a convenient tool to derive explicit equations for the different components ( [ greenc ] ) is a theorem due to langreth , which states given a product of contour - ordered green s functions of the form : @xmath110 then , the following relations hold for the different components : @xmath111\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , if we want to compute @xmath112 , in order to evaluate expectation values of observables , we must also solve two coupled equations for that function and @xmath113 .",

    "the equation for the retarded function is the retarded component of ( [ dyint3 ] ) and can be derived by applying langreth rules on this equation .",
    "the result is : @xmath139 with @xmath140 being the retarded green s function of the system described only by @xmath40 isolated from the reservoirs .",
    "this function is , in turn still an unknown in our problem .",

    "we first derive an equation of motion for @xmath140 , starting from the very definition of the retarded function , see eq.([gra ] ) , and by writing the evolution of @xmath142 with @xmath40 in the heisenberg representation : @xmath143\\,,\\ ] ] we get : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a @xmath146 matrix with elements @xmath147 and @xmath148 is the @xmath146 identity matrix .",

    "actually the combining green s functions  scattering approach is one of the most powerful and practical approaches for transport phenomena in mesoscopic structures .",
    "the scattering approach to transport phenomena in small phase - coherent samples connected to macroscopic reservoirs was introduced and developed by landauer and bttiker ( landauer 1957 , 1970 , 1975 , bttiker 1990 , 1992 , 1993 ) .    within this formalism",
    "we consider electrons only in the one - dimensional wires connecting the central system to macroscopic reservoirs .",
    "it is convenient to introduce separate operators @xmath199 for incoming and @xmath200 for scattered electrons with energy @xmath201 .",
    "then the current @xmath202 flowing into wire @xmath54 to the central system is the following ( bttiker 1992 ) : @xmath203 here @xmath204 denotes averaging over equilibrium states of reservoirs .",
    "correspondingly the dc current reads : @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the distribution function for electrons exiting the central system through the wire @xmath54 , and @xmath207 is the distribution function for electrons incoming through the wire @xmath54 .",
    "this expression tells us that the dc current is the difference per unit time between the number of electrons entering and exiting the system .",
    "as the reservoir is at equilibrium , the distribution function for the incoming electrons is the fermi distribution function .",
    "in contrast , the scattered electrons , in general , are non equilibrium particles . to calculate the distribution function for the scattered electrons we express the @xmath208-operators in terms of @xmath209-operators . since an electron coming from any wire can be scattered into a given wire @xmath54 , then the operators @xmath210 depend on all the operators for the incoming particles . in the model we consider in this chapter , the number of reservoirs is two , @xmath211 .",
    "therefore , @xmath212 , being @xmath213 the scattering amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes are normalized in such a way that their square define corresponding currents ( bttiker 1992 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath214 can be viewed as the elements of some matrix , which is called the scattering matrix @xmath215 .",
    "if the scatterer is driven by external forces which are periodic in time with period @xmath216 , then interacting with such a scatterer an electron can gain or loss some energy quanta @xmath217 , @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , in this case the scattering amplitudes in addition to the two wire indexes become dependent on the two energies , one for the incoming and the other for the outgoing electrons .",
    "such a scattering matrix is called the floquet scattering matrix @xmath219 ( see , e.g. , platero and aguado 2004 ) . their elements , @xmath220 ,",
    "are related to photon - assisted amplitudes for an electron with energy @xmath201 entering the scatterer through the lead @xmath221 and leaving the scatterer with energy @xmath222 through the lead @xmath54 .",
    "now the relation between the operators @xmath208 for outgoing particles and @xmath209 for incoming particles reads ( moskalets and bttiker 2002a ) : @xmath223 where the sum over @xmath184 runs over those @xmath184 for which @xmath224 , hence it corresponds to propagating ( i.e. current - carrying ) states .",
    "we denote the floquet scattering matrix the submatrix corresponding to transitions between the propagating states only . in the case where @xmath225 , the sum in eq.([smf_3 ] ) runs over all the integers : @xmath226 . in what follows",

    "the conservation of the particle current at each scattering event implies that the floquet scattering matrix is a unitary matrix ( moskalets and bttiker 2002a , 2004 ) : @xmath229 @xmath230    using eq.([smf_3 ] ) we calculate the distribution function for electrons scattered into wire @xmath54 : @xmath231 this function is not the fermi distribution function unless the scatterer is stationary and all the reservoirs have the same chemical potentials and temperatures .",
    "this reflects the fact that the particles scattered by the dynamical scatterer ( quantum pump ) are out of equilibrium .",
    "if the driving forces change slowly , @xmath232 , they behave as if they were almost constant for the electrons propagating through the central system . for this reason ,",
    "the scattering properties of a slowly driven ( adiabatic ) scatterer are close to those of a stationary one .",
    "nevertheless there is an essential difference : in spite of the slowly change of the fields , an electron can still absorb or emit one or several energy quanta @xmath173 in its travel through the central system .",
    "therefore , although the adiabatic scatterer is characterized by the floquet scattering matrix dependent on two energies , @xmath233 , it is natural to expect that it could be related to the stationary scattering matrix @xmath215 under these conditions    the stationary scattering matrix @xmath234 depends on the electron energy @xmath201 and some properties of the scatterer . to account the latter dependence we introduce the set of parameters , @xmath235 , @xmath236 and write @xmath237 . under the action of external periodic forces",

    "note that in the above equation the frozen scattering matrix and the matrix @xmath250 should be kept as energy - independent within a scale of order @xmath173 .",
    "the unitarity of the floquet scattering matrix puts some constraint on the matrix @xmath250 . substituting eq.([smf_17 ] ) into eq.([smf_4 ] ) and taking into account that the stationary ( frozen ) scattering matrix is unitary we get the following relation : @xmath251    the advantage of the adiabatic ansatz , eq.([smf_17 ] ) , is that the matrices @xmath234 and @xmath250 depend only on one energy and thus have a much smaller number of elements than the floquet scattering matrix .",
    "in addition , the adiabatic ansatz allows us to draw some conclusions concerning the physical properties of slowly driven systems , in particular , concerning the generated heat flows .",
    "there exists a simple relation between the floquet scattering matrix elements and the fourier coefficients for the green s function ( arrachea and moskalets 2006 ) : @xmath252 where the floquet component of the fourier transformed green s function @xmath253 was introduced in eq.([gfou ] ) .",

    "following exactly the same lines as those presented in the derivation of ( [ jpertad ] ) , we start from ( [ jqsim ] ) , we substitute the perturbative solution of the green s function ( [ gfou2 ] ) and ( [ gper ] ) and expand in taylor series the resulting expression up to the lowest non - vanishing order in @xmath245 .",

    "we identify this portion of the total heat as a pumped heat ( hence the lower index `` @xmath344 '' ) .",
    "this is the third general effect we identified in our quantum engine : the dynamical scatterer induces a directed heat transport between the reservoirs ( see , e.g. , humphrey et al .",

    "if the absolute value of this heat is larger than the one of the generated component @xmath347 , then the whole heat flowing into the @xmath8 wire is positive , i.e. directed from the reservoir to the central system , @xmath348 . in this case the reservoir @xmath8 will be cooled while @xmath7 will be heated .",
    "the splitting of @xmath81 into @xmath349 and @xmath342 helped us to show that @xmath81 can be positive .",
    "strictly speaking , such a splitting is not unique and only the whole heat current @xmath81 has a direct physical meaning .",
    "however at slow driving , one can support such a decomposition of @xmath81 into the generated and the pumped heat by additional physical arguments as follows .",
    "the expansion ( [ smf_17 ] ) allows us to calculate the heat flow with an accuracy of @xmath350 . to show it explicitly we rewrite slightly eq.([smf_12 ] )",

    "the above given splitting is justified by the following observations .",
    "( i ) the quantity @xmath360 is negative in each wire @xmath54 as it should be for the heat generated by the scatterer and flowing into the reservoirs .",
    "( ii ) at zero temperature the pumped heat vanishes identically , @xmath361 , since it is impossible to take heat out of the system kept at zero temperature . to prove the first observation we show that the integrand in eq.([smf_22 ] ) is positive",
    "to this end we use the fourier transformation and get , @xmath362 .",
    "the second observation follows from the fact that at zero temperature it is @xmath363 , hence the equation ( [ smf_23 ] ) vanishes .",
    "note that the conservation of the pumped heat current , @xmath364 , directly follows from the conservation of charge currents , eqs.([smf_18_1 ] ) and ( [ smf_18_2 ] ) , which implies @xmath365 \\partial \\hat s^{\\dagger}/\\partial t = 0 $ ] .    from eq.([smf_22 ] ) it follows that the adiabatic scatterer heats the reservoirs with a rate proportional to @xmath366 ( avron et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in contrast , the pumped heat , eq.([smf_23 ] ) , is rather proportional to @xmath367 . at sizable temperatures , @xmath273 ,",
    "the amount of pumped heat can exceed the generated heat , @xmath368 .",
    "therefore , if in the wire @xmath54 we have @xmath369 , then the reservoir @xmath54 will be cooled ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",

    "in this chapter we have introduced the basic concepts to analyze at the microscopic level the energy transport in quantum systems driven by harmonically time - dependent fields .",
    "we have introduced a simple microscopic model for a quantum pump , which consists in a finite structure connected to two macroscopic reservoirs , with ac local fields that oscillate in time with the same frequency and a phase lag .",
    "we have analyzed the fundamental conservation laws for the charge and the energy and we have defined the basic concepts to study the transport behavior in these systems : charge currents , energy currents , heat currents and powers developed by the fields .",
    "we have reviewed two complementary techniques to calculate the currents and the powers : the non - equilibrium green s function formalism for harmonically time - dependent hamiltonians and the scattering formalism for periodically driven mesoscopic systems .",
    "we have shown that the two approaches are equivalent for the evaluation of the charge and heat currents through the contacts between the driven system and the reservoirs .",
    "we have also introduced two approximations : the adiabatic approximation to the floquet scattering matrix and a perturbative solution of the dyson s equations for the green s functions valid within the weak driving regime .",
    "both techniques are important to draw conclusions on general features of the transport behavior without the explicit evaluation of the green s functions or the scattering matrix elements .",
    "such conclusions are , thus , generic and do not depend on the geometrical details of the driven structure . a summary of the technical details , including the main equations and the alternative routes to evaluate them exactly or in an approximate way is given in a diagram at the end of section iii .",
    "finally , in section iv we have applied the concepts and tools we have introduced in the previous sections in order to discuss three important mechanisms of energy transport in quantum pumps .",
    "the first one is the fact that the total work done by all the local fields is dissipated in the form of heat that flows to the reservoirs .",
    "this effect is rather expected . in any case , we have exploited our theoretical techniques at weak driving to evaluate term by term powers and heat currents and explicitly verify the conservation of the energy . to unveil a fundamental law is always a beautiful result in theoretical physics and an important support for the power of a theoretical tool .",
    "in addition we have shown that other two less expected and subtle transport mechanisms can take place : the coherent transport of energy allowing for regimes where some of the forces make work , while other receive work .",
    "this interesting mechanism could be exploited , for instance , to couple two quantum pumps in a combined engine .",
    "the final remarkable mechanism is the pumping of heat at finite temperature and weak driving , allowing for the operation of the quantum pump as a refrigerator which extracts heat from a reservoir and injects heat in the other one .",
    "the different operational regimes that we have identified in the quantum pumps have several important outcomes . on the theoretical side",
    "there are several lines to further analyze .",
    "a first issue to explore is the role of the geometrical details of the structure , in order to identify the optimal architecture to enhance each mechanism and improve the efficiency of the quantum engine .",
    "another important ingredient is the investigation of the role of many - body interactions . in particular , the electron - electron and the electron - phonon interactions . on the experimental side",
    "it would be very interesting the design of an experimental setup to implement these effects . in this sense",
    ", it is very promising that quantum refrigeration has been already experimentally explored in mesoscopic structures with superconducting elements under ac driving [ giazzoto 2006 ] .",
