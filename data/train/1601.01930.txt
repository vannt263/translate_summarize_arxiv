    "over the past decade , a new solar problem has emerged as solar photospheric abundances have been improved ( @xcite ) and the indicated solar metallicity , which is mainly due to low - z metallic elements , has been significantly revised downward than previously assumed ( @xcite ) .",
    "standard solar models ( ssms ) , which are the fundamental theoretical tools to investigate the solar interior , do not reproduce helioseismic measurements ( @xcite ) , such as the convection zone radius , the surface helium abundance and the sound speed profile ( @xcite ) , when using these revised abundances .",
    "this gave rise to the _ solar composition problem _ , motivating a rapid increase of research efforts in the field .",
    "rosseland opacity is a key quantity describing the coupling between radiation and matter in the solar interior plasma .",
    "metallic elements significantly contribute to the opacity , although they are only present as a few percent of the mixture , since bound - bound and bound - free absorption can become a major source of opacity for the partially ionized metals .",
    "thus , the amount of metals directly modifies the opacity profile of the sun and the solar composition problem is strongly related to the role of opacity in solar models .    among a variety of proposed explanations",
    ", it has been shown that in order to reproduce the helioseismic measurements , changes to the opacity are required to compensate the lower solar metallicity .",
    "specifically , it was shown , that a smooth increase of the opacity from the range of @xmath0 in the central regions to the range of @xmath1 at the radiation - convection interface is required ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is believed that the opacities of metals in the stellar mixture should be revised upward to compensate for the decreased low - z metallic element abundances .",
    "in addition , recently , the monochromatic opacity of iron , a major contributer to the solar opacity , was measured at very similar conditions to those expected near the solar convection zone boundary ( @xcite ) .",
    "the measured spectrum appears to be larger than calculations of various state of the art and widely used atomic models , by about a factor of two in several spectral regions near the l - shell photoabsorption lines .",
    "no satisfactory explanation to this discrepancy is known .",
    "we have recently developed ( @xcite ) an atomic code , named star ( sta - revised ) , for the calculation of opacities of local thermodynamic equilibrium plasmas , by the sta method .",
    "the sta method ( @xcite ) is used to group the large number of transition lines between an enormous number of configurations into large assemblies , called a super - transition - arrays ( stas ) .",
    "the stas moments are calculated analytically using the partition function algebra , and are split into smaller stas until convergence is achieved . unlike detailed line accounting ( dla ) methods such as the opacity - project ( op ) ( @xcite ) and opal ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the sta method is able to handle situations where the number of relevant transitions is immense . on the other hand , unlike average - atom models ( @xcite ) , the sta method reveals the unresolved - transition - array ( uta ) spectrum , otherwise obtained by a very costly , sometimes intractable , detailed configuration accounting ( dca ) calculation ( see ) .    in this work we use star to calculate and",
    "analyze solar opacities .",
    "the atomic calculations are based on a fully relativistic quantum mechanical theory via the dirac equation .",
    "we analyze in detail the contribution of different chemical elements in the solar mixture to the total rosseland mean opacity and examine the role of different atomic processes ( bound - bound , bound - free , free - free and scattering ) .",
    "the analysis is carried throughout the radiative zone ( that is , from the solar core to the radiation - convection boundary ) .",
    "the development of advanced stellar atmosphere models resulted in a downward revision of the solar photospheric metal abundances . in this work",
    "we use the recent @xcite ( agss09 ) set of chemical abundances for volatile elements ( c , n , o , and ne ) together with their recommended meteoritic abundances for refractory elements ( mg , si , s , and fe ) , where si is the anchor of both scales .",
    "this compilation was used as an input for evolutionary solar model calculations presented in @xcite ( and references therein ) , which we refer to as `` the ssm '' . the resulting solar profiles . ] of various quantities",
    "are used throughout this work .",
    "the ssm temperature and density profiles are shown in .",
    "the solar mixture of the ssm consists of the following 24 elements : h , he , c , n , o , ne , na , mg , al , si , p , s , cl , ar , k , ca , sc , ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co and ni . the elemental composition profiles are shown in .",
    "these are determined from the initial abundances and from the ssm due to processes such as nuclear burning , diffusion and gravitational settling .",
    "the opacity used in the ssm was calculated by the opacity - project ( op ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of intrinsic opacity changes ( that is , with a fixed composition ) on observable quantities , i.e. the convection - zone radius , surface helium abundance , sound speed profile etc , can be studied by the linear solar model ( lsm ) of @xcite .",
    "this justifies the calculation of different opacity models using the thermodynamic conditions obtained by the ssm .",
    "in this section we briefly describe various parts of the computational model implemented by the star atomic code .",
    "a more comprehensive description of the star model will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the initial step in the calculation of the opacity of a mixture is the calculation of the effective densities of the different components ( @xcite ) .",
    "a mixture of temperature @xmath2 , density @xmath3 and mass fractions @xmath4 is described as a collection of ion - spheres with different volumes , or equivalently , individual _ effective mass densities _ @xmath5 .",
    "the individual densities are found by the requirement that the chemical potentials @xmath6 of all species are equal : @xmath7 and by the condition that the volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes occupied by the individual components : @xmath8 the equality of chemical potentials insures the equality of _ electronic _ pressures only , rather than the total pressure ( including the ionic contribution , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the usual procedure adopted in the present work , is to equalize the chemical potentials @xcite , which , if the free electrons are treated semiclassically , also insures the equality of the ( free ) electronic densities at the ion sphere radius .",
    "the chemical potential can be calculated using a finite temperature thomas - fermi model ( @xcite ) for which bound and free electrons are treated semiclasically , or alternatively , with more sophisticated ion - sphere models such as the relativistic hartree - fock - slater average atom model for which bound - electrons are treated quantum - mechanically via the dirac equation ( @xcite ) , or the liberman model for which bound and free electrons are treated quantum - mechanically ( @xcite ) . in this work",
