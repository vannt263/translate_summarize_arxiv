    "with its sub - arcsec resolution , the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory has revealed a wealth of substructure in the x - ray - emitting intracluster medium ( icm ) in clusters of galaxies .",
    "`` cavities '' or `` bubbles '' are commonly seen in the x - ray gas in cluster centers related to outbursts by the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "in addition , surface brightness edges associated with shocks and cold fronts have been observed , as well as spiral features likely related to `` sloshing '' of the intracluster medium in cluster centers .",
    "the central bubbles are frequently seen in cooling flow ( or `` cool core '' ) clusters and are often filled with radio emission associated with the agn .",
    "there was some evidence for these features in a very few cases even before _",
    "chandra _ observations ( e.g.  _ rosat _ observations of perseus [ bhringer et al .",
    "1993 ] , abell 4059 [ huang & sarazin 1998 ] , and abell 2052 [ rizza et al .  2000 ] ) . clusters with cool cores have radio bubbles much more often than non - cool core clusters ( e.g. mittal et al .",
    "2009 ) , and some of the most spectacular individual cases observed by _",
    "chandra _ are the perseus cluster ( fabian et al .",

    "2001 , 2003 , 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "the classic `` cooling flow problem '' is that sufficient quantities of cool gas ( as evidenced by star formation rates , for example ) were not found to match the gas cooling rates estimated from earlier x - ray observatories .",
    "the x - ray cooling rates have lowered based on _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations , and the majority of the gas is seen to cool to only some fraction ( typically one - third to one - half ) of the cluster average temperature ( peterson et al .",
    "a heating mechanism is required to stop the gas from cooling to even lower temperatures .",
    "the most likely candidate for heating of the central cluster gas is feedback from central agn that are fed by the cooling gas ( see mcnamara & nulsen 2007 for a review ) .",
    "this heating comes in the form of bubbles inflated by the agn , described above , that then rise buoyantly to larger radii in cluster atmospheres distributing the heat .",
    "the details of this heating , however , are still not completely understood .",
    "in addition , there is at least some component of shock heating in many cluster centers , especially early on in the agn s lifetime .",
    "shocks have been detected in fewer cases than radio bubbles , and observations include those of perseus ( fabian et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; graham et al .",

    "2005 ) , and the group ngc 5813 ( randall et al .",
    "2011 ) . typically , the shocks are weak with mach numbers ranging from approximately 1.2 to 1.7 ( mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) . in even fewer cases are temperature rises detected associated with the shocks .    heating of the icm may also result from gas `` sloshing '' in the cluster s central potential well ( ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ; zuhone et al.2010 ) .",
    "cold fronts , regions where the surface brightness changes sharply but the pressure does not , can result from these sloshing motions driven initially by cluster or sub - cluster mergers .",
    "the sloshing can produce a spiral distribution of cool cluster gas reaching into the cluster center ( e.g.  clarke et al .",
    "2004 , lagan et al .",
    "2010 ) , and is also seen in galaxy groups ( randall et al .",

    "( 2009 ) , while the temperatures inside and outside this shock were consistent with the rise expected given the mach number , the best - fitting temperatures were approximately flat across the shock . here , with the much deeper data set , the rise is clearly detected . just outside the shock ,",
    "the temperature is @xmath78 kev , while inside the shock it reaches @xmath79 kev , a factor of @xmath80 higher , with a significance or @xmath81 .",
    "such temperature rises associated with weak shocks are extremely difficult to measure in cluster centers , with very deep , high resolution observations required .    for the second shock , the situation is less obvious .",
    "the best - fitting temperatures are appproximately flat across the shock : @xmath82 kev outside the shock and @xmath83 kev inside the shock .",
    "therefore , even within the errors , this is inconsistent with the expected temperature jump of 1.19 , with the highest rise permitted giving a factor of 1.07 .",
    "however , as noted above , temperature rises associated with weak shocks are very difficult to detect , and due to projection effects , measured rises are expected to be lower than might be expected based on shock strengths alone ( e.g. randall et al .",
    "in addition , the gas may cool due to adiabatic expansion ( mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) . also , we note that the temperature drops precipitously in the next annulus inward from the annulus just inside the shock boundary . this may indicate that the temperature of the gas just inside the shock boundary was also previously much lower before being shocked , and then the rise in temperature in this region may be higher than we have estimated above .",
    "in addition , we fitted a projected density model to the surface brightness profile in a wedge to the sw with pa @xmath84 to @xmath85 from n out to a radius of @xmath86 to characterize the inner shocks in this direction .",
    "we find similar results to the sw as we did to the ne for the first inner shock .",
    "we find a density jump of a factor of @xmath87 at a radius of @xmath88 arcsec ( @xmath89 kpc ) .",
    "however , as can be seen in the surface brightness distribution in the images ( i.e. fig .   [ fig:3color ] ) , the second inner shock edge seems less sharp and extends to larger radii in the sw than in the ne .",
    "we do not find a density jump corresponding to the second inner shock to the sw , only a change in slope at a radius of 107 arcsec ( 75.5 kpc ) .",
    "the spiral feature visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta2d ] is similar to that seen in simulations of gas sloshing in cluster centers ( ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ) . the sloshing sets up cold fronts and the distinctive spiral morphology .",
    "we therefore would expect the excesses seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta2d ] to be visible as excesses in surface brightness profiles containing these regions .",
    "temperature profiles should show cooler gas coincident with the surface brightness enhancements .",
    "in addition , the simulations predict that the bright , sloshing , spiral region will contain gas of lower entropy as cluster central gas is displaced to larger radii . as shown in ",
    "[ sec : maps ] , the spiral excess is coincident with regions of low temperature and entropy in projected maps .",
    "we have extracted surface brightness profiles from wedges in three directions : sw , ne , and nw . the sw corresponds to the bright , inner part of the spiral , while the ne includes the outer region of the spiral , and the nw is largely free from any spiral excess emission and serves as a comparison region .",
    "the sectors used for the profiles are shown superposed on the @xmath16 kev residual image in fig .",

    "the surface brightness profiles for the three regions are shown in fig .",

    "relative to the nw , non - spiral region , the sw shows excess emission from approximately @xmath90 ( 42  138 kpc ) , corresponding to the inner part of the sprial . to the ne , excess emission is seen beyond approximately @xmath91 ( 78 kpc ) .",
    "note that the enhancement in the nw in the @xmath92 ( 7  14 kpc ) region shows that the bubble rims are brightest in this region , which also corresponds to cooler gas seen in @xmath21 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : halphatmap ] , [ fig : halphaimg ] ) .",
    "we have extracted spectra in the three wedges and determined projected temperature profiles .",
    "the spectra were extracted separately for each of the observations as well as for the corresponding background files .",
    "the spectra for each region were fitted simultaneously using an apec thermal plasma model .",
    "absorption was fixed at the galactic value and elemental abundances were allowed to vary .",
    "projected temperature profiles comparing the sw and nw ( non - spiral ) regions and the ne and nw regions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ktswnw ] and [ fig : ktnenw ] , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "significant drops in temperature are seen in the regions corresponding to the surface - brightness excesses associated with the spiral described above .",
    "in addition , the high surface brightness @xmath93 ( 7  14 kpc ) region in the nw has cooler temperatures than those radii regions to the sw and ne .",
    "this is likely due , at least in part , to the larger contribution to the emission measure from the bright , compressed , cool , bubble rims to the nw at these radii as compared to the same radii to the sw and ne , where the bubble rims are not as bright .    in order to examine the bright region of the spiral to the sw in more detail ,",
    "we have fitted a projected density model to the surface brightness profile , as described above for the ne sector shock fits . to focus on the cold front / spiral edge",
    ", we fit only regions with @xmath94 .",
    "we find a density jump of a factor of @xmath95 at a radius of @xmath96 arcsec ( @xmath97 kpc ) from the cluster center .",
    "we extracted spectra in larger bins to the sw , and performed a spectral deprojection as described above for the ne .",
    "profiles of temperature , density , and pressure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : swdepro ] . dashed lines , going from smaller to larger annuli , indicate the positions of the first inner shock , the second inner shock / edge , and the exterior edge of the cold front / sw spiral .",
    "since the deprojection introduces some scatter , particularly in the region between the inner shocks , we have also plotted the projected temperature profile as well as the pressure profile using the projected temperatures ( shown as open circles ) .",
    "a temperature rise is seen associated with the first inner shock , but not the second inner shock .",
    "a clear density fall off is seen at the outer edge of the sw spiral .",
    "the temperatures within the sprial region are cooler than those outside of it .    projected abundance profiles to the sw and ne are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundprof ] .",
    "the dashed line marks the outer edge of the spiral to the sw ( at @xmath98 , as determined above ) . the abundance is higher in the bright , sw , spiral region , than in the corresponding radial region to the ne .",

    "the entropy is defined as @xmath99 , and projected temperature values were used . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundprof ] , the outer edge of the sw spiral region is marked with a dashed line .",
    "there is clearly a cross - over in the entropy profiles for the sw and ne regions near this radius . from @xmath100 ,",
    "low entropy values are found coincident with the sw spiral excess . in the ne ,",
    "the spiral excess is at larger radii , and this is seen in the entropy profile , where the values are low in the ne with radii greater than approximately @xmath101 .",
    "this is striking confirmation of the predictions from sloshing models , where central , low entropy , cluster gas is displaced to larger radii ( i.e.  ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ) .",
    "the sum of the evidence , including the surface brightness profiles , and temperature , abundance , and entropy distributions , points to the spiral being a cold front / sloshing feature resulting from an off - axis merger earlier in the cluster s history .",
    "clear cavities ( or `` bubbles '' ) in the x - ray emission are seen in the _ chandra _ images to the n and s of the agn .",
    "in addition , there is a small bubble bounded by a narrow x - ray filament to the nw and a bubble separated from the s bubble to the se .",
    "a very small depression is also seen to the e. these features are all filled with 4.8 ghz radio emission as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : unsharp ] . as described in ",
    "[ sec : radio ] , we created a radio spectral index map using the 1.4 and 4.8 ghz vla data .",
    "the map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : specindex ] with contours of @xmath22 gaussian - smoothed x - ray emission in the @xmath15 kev band superposed .",
    "the spectral index is flattest at the position of the radio and x - ray core , and steepens into the radio lobes .",
    "the regions we have identified as outer bubbles , to the nw and se , are associated with regions with distinctly steeper spectral indices .",
    "this is consistent with these bubbles resulting from an earlier stage in the current outburst , or from a separate , earlier agn outburst , since the high - energy electrons age faster than the lower energy electrons , resulting in steepening of the spectrum over time .",
    "the radio emission `` leaking '' out of the n bubble through the bubble rim directly n of the agn has a spectral index consistent with that filling the n lobe , making it likely that this emission is part of the current agn outburst .",
    "obvious additional bubbles are not seen outside of this central region in the images , including the unsharp - masked images .",
    "also , lower frequency radio emission at 330 mhz ( zhao et al .  1993 ) has a similar extent as the 1.4 and 4.8 ghz emission . to search for more bubbles at larger radii , we have made a pressure - difference map .",
    "the map was created by fitting a 2d beta model to a pressure map with @xmath49 bins , and a minimum of 10000 background - subtracted counts for each region used for a spectral fit .",
    "this corresponds to the temperature map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmap10000 ] .",
    "the center was fixed to the position found in the 2d beta model fit to the surface brightness , described in [ sec : beta ] .",
    "the values for the ellipticity and position angle of the ellipse , 0.17 and @xmath102 from w , respectively , were similar to those found for the surface brightness fit .",
    "the pressure - difference map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressdiff ] , with 4.8 ghz radio contours superposed .",
    "regions of low pressure are evident to the n and s of the agn , along the current axis of the radio source . for both the n and s apparently low - pressure regions on the map , we have extracted spectra within circular apertures covering the regions , as well as comparison regions in surrounding circular annuli .",
    "we have calculated `` projected '' pressures , defined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the apec normalization , for the apparent bubbles ( low pressure regions ) and the comparison annuli .",
    "for the n bubble , we find a significance in the lower projected pressure of @xmath103 compared to the comparison annulus , and for the s bubble , the significance is @xmath104 .",
    "these regions of lower pressure may represent outer bubbles from an earlier outburst ( or multiple earlier outbursts ) of the agn .",
    "future higher dynamic range radio data may give further evidence that these features are related to agn activity .",
    "approximating both of these possible bubbles as spheres with radii of 34 kpc , located 75 kpc from the cluster center , we calculate their energy input into the icm as @xmath105 ( churazov et al .",
    "this assumes that the bubbles are filled with relativistic plasma ( @xmath106 ) . using the average pressure at the cluster radius of 75 kpc of @xmath107 dyn @xmath38",
    ", we find that each bubble can add @xmath108 erg to the icm .",
    "we have presented first results from a very deep _ chandra _ observation of abell 2052 .",
    "detailed structure is seen in the inner part of the cluster , including bubbles , bright shells , and filaments .",
    "radio emission at 4.8 ghz is seen to fill bubbles to the n and s of the agn , as well as outer bubbles to the nw and se , and a small bubble to the e. @xmath21 emission is coincident with the brightest and coolest regions in the cluster center , including the e - w bar and the filament in the n bubble , indicating that at least some gas is cooling to @xmath40 k.    an inner shock is clearly seen surrounding the cluster center , as well as a second feature exterior to the first that is also most likely a shock .",
    "both edges in surface brightness can be described as arising from shocks with mach numbers @xmath109 . for the inner shock , evidence for an associated temperature rise",
    "is seen in a three - color image .",
    "also , a temperature profile reveals a significant increase inside this region , consistent with that expected given the shock strength .",
    "such temperature rises associated with weak shocks driven by agn in the centers of cool core clusters have only rarely been measured , given the narrow widths of the shocks , the small magnitudes of the temperature rises , and the cooling related to adiabatic expansion and the projection of cluster gas at larger radii .",
    "a spiral feature is seen , and is well - described as resulting from gas sloshing related to a cluster - cluster or sub - cluster merger earlier in the lifetime of a2052 .",
    "there is also evidence of dynamical activity in the cluster from optical spectroscopy : the central cd has a fairly large peculiar velocity ( @xmath110 km s@xmath4 ) relative to the cluster mean ( oergerle & hill 2001 ) . the x - ray spiral is brightest to the sw , and continues around the cluster center to the e and ne . the sw portion of the excess emission was shown in lagan et al .

    "presented several residual _ chandra _ images of cool core clusters , and noted that a2052 was an exception in not exhibiting a spiral feature in the available data , and de plaa et al .  described the sw excess as a cold front . here , in addition to exhibiting an excess in surface brightness on a 2d model - subtracted _",
    "chandra _ image , the brightness distribution is confirmed using surface brightness profiles in different sectors across the image .",
    "the spiral is also shown to contain gas cooler than its surroundings in both temperature maps and sector profiles .",
    "regions of low entropy are found coincident with the spiral surface - brightness excess .",
    "finally , the abundance is higher in the spiral region than its surroundings .",
    "this is consistent with central , low - entropy , high - metallicity gas sloshing out to larger radii .",
    "therefore , sloshing can play a part in redistributing the metals within a cluster ( simionescu et al .",
    "2010 , de plaa et al .",
    "outbursts from the agn also play a role in metal redistribution ( kirkpatrick et al .  2009 ) .",
    "detailed measurements of the spectral properties of similar diffuse spiral excesses have only rarely been measured . while lagan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , for example , presented evidence of excess surface - brightness spirals in several systems , in many cases temperature declines were not detected associated with the spiral features , and if they were , they were most often only measured for the bright , inner spiral regions .",
    "while the radio emission shows clear correspondence with deficits in the x - ray emission , and the extended radio structure is likely related to typical radio lobes from the agn , there may be some component of radio mini - halo emission .",
    "a correlation has been found between the presence of sloshing features in clusters and mini - halos ( zuhone , markevitch , & brunetti 2011 ) , and these mini - halos may result from reacceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence associated with sloshing ( mazzotta & giacintucci 2008 ) . with our current radio data , however , we do not see obvious correspondence between the radio emission and the spiral sloshing feature .",
    "there is evidence for outer bubbles related to one or more earlier outbursts from the agn . while not seen in the surface brightness images , deficits are evident in a pressure - residual map after subtracting off a model of the average pressure distribution .",
    "the deficits are seen to the n and s of the cluster center , in line with the current axis of the radio lobes .",
