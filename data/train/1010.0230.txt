    "complex magnetic ground states in crystalline materials frequently derive from the details of the underlying lattices . in the popular example of insulating compounds where the magnetic ions arrange themselves with three - fold symmetries ( _ e.g. _ triangular or pyrochlore lattices ) , geometric frustration of magnetic interactions prevents magnetic ordering or gives rise to exotic ground states.@xcite alternatively , the dilution of magnetic ions can yield complex magnetic order , since the translational periodicity of the lattice",
    "is necessarily interrupted .",
    "for example , in diluted uniaxial anisotropic antiferromagnets , such as co@xmath4zn@xmath5f@xmath2 , local uncompensated moments result from random variations in the exchange interactions from the non - magnetic impurities.@xcite upon zero - field cooling , neutron diffraction reveals a nel state ; however , the random fields decrease the diffracted peak intensity from disrupted long - range order ( lro ) and field cooling completely destroys the lro.@xcite because these systems show no preference for chemical or short - range order within a disordered nuclear unit - cell,@xcite it is difficult to structurally distinguish the role of the impurities in establishing the random fields and microdomains .",
    "the layered antiferromagnet , @xmath6-co(oh)@xmath2 , contains only edge - sharing co@xmath7 octahedra and shows field - induced magnetic behavior below 12.3 k.@xcite in the @xmath8-cobalt hydroxides studied here , the layers of edge - sharing octahedra are disrupted by stellating cobalt tetrahedra ( fig.[fig : structure ] ) .",
    "these modified structures are often referred to as @xmath8-co(oh)@xmath2.@xcite the series of @xmath8-cobalt hydroxide chlorides are described by the chemical formula co(oh)@xmath0(cl)@xmath1(h@xmath2o)@xmath3 , where _ x _",
    "= 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 assumes the tetrahedrally coordinated cobalt content , and @xmath9 = 1.3 , 0.9 , and 0.3 , respectively.@xcite we refer to the @xmath6-co(oh)@xmath2 compounds as @xmath10 .    in a traditional unit - cell",
    "based description of the structure , all cobalt site occupancies ( @xmath11 ) are reduced ( @xmath12 ) and randomly averaged [ fig .",
    "[ fig : structure](a ) ] . therefore , a local description is needed to locate all of the atom positions and occupancies . from our extensive analysis of the x - ray pair distribution functions of these compounds,@xcite",
    "the distribution of cobalt polyhedra is best described by a random combination of structural motifs [ fig.[fig : structure](b - d ) ] .",
    "we propose that chemical short - range order of the local structure generates complex magnetic behavior , as in diluted uniaxial anisotropic antiferromagnets .    here",
    "we report magnetic susceptibility measurements to reveal uncompensated magnetization , yet magnetic neutron diffraction suggests a periodic nel antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "we present a method of assembling local motifs in real space to microscopically reconcile a quantitative description of the random distribution of exchange interactions and the resulting microdomains .",
    "the experimental samples with @xmath13 = 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 were prepared and characterized as previously described@xcite and material with @xmath14 was purchased from alfa - aesar .",
    "magnetic characterization was performed on powder samples embedded in paraffin wax ( melted to @xmath15c ) using a quantum design mpms squid magnetometer .",
    "the specific heats of co(oh)@xmath0(cl)@xmath5(h@xmath2o)@xmath16 for @xmath17 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 and the non - magnetic analogs mg(oh)@xmath2 and zn(oh)@xmath18cl@xmath19h@xmath2o@xmath20 were measured using a semi - adiabatic technique as implemented in a quantum design physical properties measurement system .",
    "all powder samples were mixed with ag powder ( 50 wt% ) in an agate mortar and pestle until homogeneous .",
    "pellets of the mixed powder were pressed in a die ( 3 by 9 mm , @xmath210.5 mm thickness ) at 0.5 tons .",
    "the silver provides mechanical stability to the pellet and improves thermal conductivity to prevent thermal gradients and increase the thermal relaxation . both stage with thermal grease and ag calibrations",
    "were collected separately before measuring divided pellets ( 3 by 3 mm , approximately 10 mg ) , which were affixed to the sample stage using thermal grease .",
    "a deuterated analog was synthesized from a d@xmath2o solution for neutron experiments .",
    "neutron diffraction of co(od)@xmath18(cl)@xmath19(d@xmath2o)@xmath22 was recorded on the hipd beamline at the lujan neutron scattering center at los alamos national laboratory at both 6 k and 300 k. approximately 1 g of sample was packed into a vanadium canister . to calculate and subtract sample absorption using pdfgetn,@xcite scattering profiles of the empty vanadium container , the evacuated chamber , and a vanadium rod",
    "were also collected .",
    "all other experimental details are described in the text where relevant .",
    "experimental uncertainty of reported values ( _ e.g. _ saturation magnetization , entropy ) is determined from the sum in quadrature of fractional uncertainties , with the predominant source of error originating from determination of the measured sample mass .",
    "the static magnetic susceptibilities , measured in zero - field and field - cooling conditions , show a nearly constant @xmath23 with composition , as determined by the tempearture at which @xmath24 ( fig.[fig : suscept ] , table[tab : curie ] ) .",
    "the curves for @xmath25 show two cusps at approximately 28.4  k and 9.4  k [ fig.[fig : suscept](a , d ) ] , suggestive of multiple ordering transitions or sublattice compensation points .",
    "while the lower temperature maximum is obvious for @xmath25 , there are subtle changes present in the @xmath26 0.3 and 0.4 compounds visible in the ac susceptibility , fig[fig : ac ] .",
    "all compounds show frequency dependent cusps in the phase near @xmath23 , and again at @xmath219  k. the strong frequency dependence in the dynamic susceptibility is supportive of the freezing of glassy spins from different sublattices or microdomains .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl : local ]    from the polyhedral composition provided by the real - space analysis,@xcite we calculate the individual moment contributions from each local motif with the assumption that all co@xmath27 are parallel , and dilute co@xmath28 spins ( as in [ co@xmath29co@xmath30 ) are antiparallel to co@xmath27 in a nel configuration [ fig.[fig : structuremag](b - d ) ] .",

    "we compute a negligible dependence of @xmath37 on composition with values comparable to those observed .",
    "the agreement of the observed properties with the assembly of local contributions reconciles the inaccuracies resulting from the disordered average structure and microdomain - like magnetic diffraction .",
    "while the average symmetry - allowed magnetic structure of the layered cobalt hydroxides appears as a fully compensated nel - type antiferromagnet , the magnetic behavior is better explained by local and randomly distributed intralayer nel ferrimagnetic regions that can be aligned with an applied field , interspersed with disordered defect spins that interrupt compensation of the ferrimagnetic regions from layer to layer .",
    "we present an extreme case in which magnetic site occupancy exhibits no long - range order , yet a long - range ordered magnetic structure is observed , on average .",
    "analyses using probes of average structural and magnetic structures are typically interpreted under the assumption that a single unit - cell suffices to describe systems in their entirety .",
    "this assumption breaks down when there is disorder .",
    "we illustrate here that the local atomic structure offers an alternative structural mechanism for introducing random fields in a magnetic lattice to yield microdomain behavior .",
