    "a large ion collider experiment ( alice )  @xcite is designed to study strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities in high - energy nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the individual subsystems of the detector are arranged in a central barrel and a forward muon spectrometer , which are specifically designed to study pb  pb as well as pp and p - pb collisions as reference .",
    "the main tracking devices in the central barrel are , in the order from closest to furthest away from the interaction region , the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , the transition radiation detector ( trd ) and the time of flight ( tof ) system . at central rapidity and down to low transverse momenta ( @xmath5 )",
    ", alice has unique particle identification ( pid ) capabilities as well as high tracking and vertexing precision .",
    "these allow for a detailed characterization of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . within this scope",
    "the light quark sector is extensively studied by alice .",
    "for example , the charged particle production in pb ",
    "pb collisions was determined via the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath6 ) and it was observed that the suppression of high-@xmath5 particles strongly depends on event centrality  @xcite . for the first time , higher harmonic anisotropic flow was measured for charged particles in pb ",
    "pb collisions  @xcite , giving insight into initial spatial anisotropy and fluctuations .",
    "further , a large enhancement in the strange baryon / meson - ratio was observed  @xcite , which may be explained by coalescence models .",
    "in addition , alice has performed several measurements in the heavy - flavor sector .",
    "a strong suppression of @xmath7 meson production in pb  pb at lhc energies was measured for the first time down to @xmath8  @xcite . in comparison , models predict a hierarchy in the energy loss , @xmath9 , for example due to the dead cone effect  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , data from pb ",
    "pb collisions indicates a non - zero elliptic flow of @xmath7 mesons  @xcite , which suggests that charm quarks might participate in the collective expansion of the system",
    ". however , to achieve deeper insight , especially within the scope of rare heavy quark production , high - statistics , precision measurements at very low @xmath5 are required .",
    "the so - called _ phase 0 of the lhc schedule was completed in the beginning of 2013 .",
    "after the first long shutdown from 2013 to 2014 , in which the alice detector completion is scheduled , the _ phase 1 program will then start in 2015 until 2017 . in this time period ,",
    "a total of 1  @xmath10 of pb  pb at @xmath11 = 5.5  tev and further pp and p  pb reference data are planned to be collected . in the second long shutdown from 2017 until 2018 ,",
    "significant detector upgrades are planned . beginning in 2018 with the _",
    ", the lhc will increase its luminosity with pb beams up to an interaction rate of about 50  khz , which corresponds to an instantaneous luminosity of @xmath12 . with the high - rate upgrade a total amount of data of more than 10  nb@xmath13 ( pb  pb ) and more than 6  @xmath14 ( pp reference )",
    "will be available in alice .",
    "the alice upgrade concept  @xcite aims for new high - precision aa measurements of rare probes at low @xmath5 . among these are measurements of @xmath7 mesons to zero @xmath5 , charm and beauty baryons ( accessible for the first time ) and the measurement of beauty via displaced @xmath15 ( accessible for the first time ) to almost zero @xmath5 .",
    "the latter is limited by the statistical uncertainty obtained , which is much larger than the systematic uncertainty from theory - driven methods . within this concept ,",
    "the alice upgrade entails a new , high - resolution and low - material its .",
    "this detector yields significant improvements for vertexing and tracking at low @xmath5 , namely of the pointing resolution ( up to a factor of 5 better ) as well as the tracking efficiency and the momentum resolution .",
    "further , for low-@xmath5 heavy - flavor measurements , a continuous readout is planned at a rate of up to 50  khz for pb  pb and several mhz for pp collisions , with high level trigger data compression based on charge clusters stemming from particle tracks .",
    "this is necessary because of the very high trigger rates for the most interesting signals , as background candidates that pass the selections would also fire the trigger . in case of a conventional trigger and due to the small signal - over - background ratio ( s / b ) of many signals",
    ", a minimum @xmath5 threshold would be required to stay at affordable rates , i.e. for @xmath16 with @xmath17 gives a rate of 16  khz .",
    "such a cut at trigger level prevents the measurement at very low @xmath5 . besides a new its readout ,",
    "an upgrade of the readout systems of most of the detectors of the central barrel to a pipelined readout is foreseen , including a complete replacement of the tpc readout chambers with gas electron multipliers ( gems ) at the endcaps . _ _ _",
    "the rareness and the low s / b ratio of the desired signals at low @xmath5 pose strong constraints on the design of the upgraded its  @xcite . in order to achieve the required improvement of the impact parameter resolution",
    ", the radial position of the first layers of silicon detectors will be moved closer to the interaction point ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "depending on the final design , the total material budget @xmath19 per layer will be reduced from presently 1.14  % to as low as 0.3  % .",
    "the overall pixel size improves from currently @xmath20 m ( r@xmath21 ) @xmath22 m ( z ) to @xmath23 m @xmath24 m ) or @xmath25 m @xmath26 m ) for monotlithic and state - of - the - art hybrid pixels respectively . an improved tracking efficiency and @xmath5 resolution at low @xmath5",
    "is achieved by adding an additional detection layer ( 7 in total ) and increasing the pixel granularity .",
    "the radial extension increases to .",
    "in addition it will be possible to quickly insert or remove the detector for yearly maintenance .",
    "two design options have been studied for the upgraded its , either consisting of seven layers of pixel detectors or of three inner layers of pixel detectors and four outer layers of strip detectors .",
    "the first option yields better standalone tracking efficiency and @xmath5 resolution , whereas the second design has better standalone pid capabilities . here , only the first option will be addressed .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath15 decays , which was performed on pb  pb data with good precision , is used as a benchmark to quantify the improved performance of the new its . in order to estimate the its upgrade performance , a so - called _ hybrid simulation approach was used .",
    "this is a simple scaling of the residuals of impact parameters ( @xmath27 ) and transverse momentum based on their true values from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",

    "pb collisions in this @xmath5 range .",
    "the spread of the @xmath6 ( varied between 0.3 and 1 ) and of the fonll prediction are the major sources of the rather large uncertainty .",
    "the cut efficiencies were determined using mc simulations . scaling to an integrated luminosity of @xmath32 , a statistical significance above one hundred is measured at any @xmath5 , which leads to higher precision and extended @xmath5 range of the measurements of @xmath28 and @xmath6 .",
