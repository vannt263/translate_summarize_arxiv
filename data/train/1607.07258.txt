    "modern galaxy evolution models typically include feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in order to explain the drop - off in the galaxy mass function compared with the expected halo mass function above @xmath2 , prevent the cooling catastrophe in galaxy clusters and produce the scaling relations between galaxies and their central supermassive black holes ( smbh ) .",
    "the existence of a feedback link has been all but confirmed observationally , with pc - scale relativistic winds and massive outflows on scales from sub - kpc @xcite to several kpc detected in a number of galaxies , sometimes both types seen in the same object @xcite .    despite this robust general picture ,",
    "a number of questions remain regarding the effects of agn feedback upon the host galaxies .",
    "one question is the range of spatial scales over which outflows are found .",
    "simple models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict outflows propagating with roughly constant velocity out to very large radii . however , agn outflows are only detected within the central @xmath3  kpc of the nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that agn outflows should expand for a long time after the driving agn switches off ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might offer an explanation to this problem .",
    "another question is the possibility of the outflow triggering star formation in the galaxy disc . such a process has been proposed and investigated before @xcite , but there is still no consensus .",
    "observations do not provide a unique answer either , with agn activity found associated with both elevated and suppressed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) star formation in the host galaxy , while sometimes no connection is evident at all ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one interesting piece of evidence is recent detection of star formation being quenched from the inside out in galaxy discs @xcite .",
    "we suggest that similar behaviour may be expected from disc galaxies affected by agn outflows .    in this paper , we investigate both the propagation of agn - driven outflows and their effect on galaxy discs by means of a semi - analytical model .",
    "we track the expansion of an outflow driven by a flickering agn by numerically integrating the equation of motion and find that the outflow is more likely to be detected close to the centre of the galaxy than far away .",
    "we assume that the growth of the central black hole and the accompanying agn activity switches off once the total energy injected into the outflow is of order the binding energy of the gas , because this starves the central black hole . with this assumption",
    "we show that outflows are only detectable within @xmath4  kpc of the centre of the host galaxy while the galaxy nucleus is active .",
    "next we use a simple prescription based on the ks law to calculate the expected star formation rate and dynamical pressure in the galactic disc and compare this with the outflow pressure .",
    "we find that agn outflows can produce a significant enhancement of star formation , especially in the outskirts of galaxy discs .",
    "this process helps eventually quench star formation from inside out , similar to the suggestion in recent work @xcite , by exhausting the available gas supply .",
    "it offers a diagnostic tool for detecting remnant outflows which might be unobservable directly .",
    "we structure this paper as follows . in section [ sec : windmodel ] , we briefly describe the basics of the agn wind outflow model . in section [ sec : expansion ] , we describe the numerical integrator used to follow the evolution of the outflow driven by a flickering agn and present the results of outflow size . in section [ sec : burst ] , we consider the effect of such an outflow upon the galactic disc and estimate the strength of the starburst .",
    "we discuss in section [ sec : discuss ] and conclude in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "to model the agn feedback we consider the interaction of agn winds with the surrounding medium , which produces large  scale outflows .",

    "we briefly summarize the main features .",

    "the central supermassive black hole in a galaxy accretes material from the surroundings via a geometrically thin , optically thick disc . at sufficiently high accretion rates ,",
    "radiation pressure from the disc and corona drives a wind with mass outflow rate comparable to the accretion rate , i.e. @xmath5 . the wind is launched with a velocity of order the escape velocity at the launch radius , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the radiative efficiency of accretion .",
    "the wind self  regulates to stay at a compton optical depth of approximately unity , so that each photon of the agn radiation field scatters on average once before escaping from the wind .",
    "this leads to the wind momentum rate @xmath8 and an energy rate @xmath9    the wind collides with the interstellar medium ( ism ) surrounding the agn and shocks against it , driving an outflow .",
    "the dynamics of the outflow depend on whether the shocked wind cools efficiently . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the large  scale outflows that follow the establishing of the @xmath10 relation and sweep the galaxy clear of interstellar gas . in this phase",
    "all cooling processes are negligible , so the wind shock is adiabatic .",
    "we call this type of outflow energy  driven , because all the agn wind energy is used to drive the outflow ( but note that the forward shock into the ism need not be adiabatic  in fact there are indications that it may cool strongly ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "under ideal circumstances , the agn wind has a kinetic energy rate @xmath11 and a momentum rate @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these winds drive the interstellar gas out of the galaxy bulge at rates of several @xmath13 and speeds @xmath14 these results are remarkably consistent with observations of large  scale molecular outflows in galaxies , and in one case a driving agn wind with parameters very close to eqs .",
    "( [ mom ] , [ en ] ) is seen simultaneously @xcite .    despite these successes ,",
    "some parts of this picture need clarification .",
    "in particular , most outflows are observed at distances @xmath15 10 kpc from the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "the analytical models predict outflow velocities @xmath16 when the agn is active .",
    "naively , this would mean that observations generally select outflows no more than a few myr after the start of agn activity , which is at first sight puzzling .",
    "but there is considerable evidence that agn activity is very time  dependent , with only a short duty cycle @xcite . in the next section",
    "we argue that outflows driven by such ` flickering ' agn explain this and other features of the observed outflows .",
    "an energy - driven spherically symmetric outflow expands because of the adiabatic expansion of the wind bubble inside it .",
    "the equation of motion for the contact discontinuity between the shocked wind and the shocked ism can in principle be derived ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "* ) from newton s second law and the energy equation . in previous papers we derived this equation of motion for outflows with several simplifying assumptions . here",
    ", we derive it in the most general case which is analytically tractable , keeping only three assumptions :    * the whole system is always spherically symmetric ; * the shocked wind is completely adiabatic ; * the wind bubble moves as a single entity , i.e. there are no significant radial velocity gradients inside the shocked wind region because the sound crossing time is much shorter than other timescales relevant in the problem .    with these assumptions the motion of the shocked wind bubble",
    "is completely specified in terms of the radius @xmath17 of the contact discontinuity with the ism .",
    "this allows a very simple description at the cost of some loss of detail , since we do not specify the physics of the forward shock , and so exactly how mass is swept up by the expanding wind bubble . fortunately we will see that our conclusions are not sensitive to the various assumptions one can make here .",
    "we consider the effects of making different assumptions in section [ sec : detect ] .",
    "in deriving the equation of motion , we specify all vector quantities with respect to the distant upstream medium .",

    "ism is added to the outflow .",
    "because the shocked wind gas is extremely dilute , the contact discontinuity is highly rayleigh ",
    "taylor unstable @xcite so the shocked ism is mixed with it rather than forming a thin shell ahead of it .",
    "but the fact that the observed outflows show molecular gas moving at speeds @xmath30 probably also means that the interstellar gas cools very rapidly . by keeping the assumptions of spherical symmetry and outflow uniformity",

    ", we refer to the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) as the driving term , the next four terms as the kinetic terms , and the final term ( involving the square brackets ) as the gravity term .",
    "we integrate equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) numerically to follow the outflow expansion for a specified history of nuclear activity , expressed as a function @xmath37 . in most cases ,",
    "when the outflow properties change gradually , the results of the numerical integration do not depend on the chosen integration scheme ; we checked that this is so using a third order taylor integration scheme and both dkd and kdk leapfrog algorithms .",
    "these methods produce slight differences in situations where one or more parameters change abruptly and rapidly , but these situations occur only due to the assumed perfect conservation of energy and would not appear in reality , so the choice of the integrator should not introduce errors larger than our other assumptions do .",
    "therefore , the calculations presented below are performed using a third order taylor integration scheme for outflow radius ( and , correspondingly , a second order scheme for velocity and a first order scheme for acceleration ) .",
    "the timestep is adaptive and equal to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the courant factor .",
    "the equation of motion has a large number of free parameters specifying the gas and background density distributions and the agn luminosity , therefore we first analyze the behaviour of a fiducial model and then consider deviations from it .",
    "the fiducial model has a galaxy composed of an @xmath40 halo which has an nfw @xcite density profile with virial radius @xmath41  kpc and concentration parameter @xmath42 , and an @xmath43 bulge with a hernquist density profile with scale radius @xmath44  kpc .",
    "the gas fraction in the halo is @xmath45 , while in the bulge it is @xmath46 .",
    "the central agn is powered by accretion on to a black hole of mass @xmath47 .",
    "we use the same initial conditions for the outflow properties in each simulation , with @xmath48  kpc , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in earlier work @xcite , we showed that the initial conditions have little effect upon the simulation results , provided that the outflow is initially confined to the central parts of the galaxy , as is done here .",
    "we consider a schematic agn luminosity history describing three stages of smbh growth . in the first stage",
    ", the smbh grows together with its host galaxy , but generally stays below the mass given by the relevant @xmath51 relation .",
    "some small  scale outflows might be formed during this stage during periods of agn activity , but these do not have a large  scale impact upon the gas distribution in the galaxy .",
    "accordingly , we do not model this stage .",
    "the second stage occurs when episodic agn activity inflates a large  scale outflow .",
    "we model this as a ` flickering ' agn , with luminosity equal to @xmath52 for periods of @xmath53  yr , separated by some inactive phase , giving an agn duty cycle @xmath54 @xcite . using different values of @xmath55",
    "has no effect on our overall results . at the end of this stage ,",
    "the agn has removed enough gas from its surroundings to completely shut off its own accretion , and so the third stage is marked by a coasting outflow which is not illuminated by an agn .",
    "this history is qualitatively consistent with the cosmological quasar number density function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which shows quasar numbers increasing from high redshifts to @xmath56 and decreasing after this . in our picture , the increase in quasar numbers happens as smbhs grow to higher masses , while the decrease occurs once they begin quenching their own gas supplies .",
    "the precise value of agn energy injection required to quench accretion is difficult to determine . since the agn may well be fed by dense gas clumps which are relatively unperturbed by the passage of an energy ",
    "driven outflow @xcite , injection greater than the binding energy of a spherically  symmetric mass distribution may be needed .",
    "in addition , the wind has not only to lift the gas against gravity , but also expand itself , doing nonzero @xmath21d@xmath26 work in the process .",
    "after some trial and error , we assumed a total luminous energy release of @xmath57 times the gas binding energy in our fiducial model .",
    "this gives the wind kinetic energy driving the outflow as @xmath58 times the gravitational binding energy .",
    "for the fiducial model , @xmath59  erg , so the agn has to be active for @xmath60  myr in total , assuming a constant eddington ratio @xmath61 during the active phases .",
    "we also consider total energy inputs 2 times higher and 2 times smaller than the fiducial one .",
    "for each of these , we calculate the expansion of the outflow with agn duty cycles of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : fiducial_velocities ] , we show the time evolution of the outflow radius ( assumed to be given by the contact discontinuity radius @xmath17 ; top panel ) and velocity @xmath66 ( middle panel ) , and the relation between velocity and radius ( bottom panel ) for the fiducial model .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the duration of a single agn activity episode .",
    "the agn shuts off completely at @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70  myr for the four agn duty cycles ( black solid , green dashed , red dot  dashed and orange dot ",
    "double  dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "qualitatively , all four outflows expand in a similar fashion .",
    "the oscillations caused by agn flickering smooth out quickly ( in @xmath71myr ) , and the outflow behaves as if driven by an agn with a lower but constant luminosity .",
    "the outflow velocity does not vary significantly with time in any given model and is typically between @xmath72 and @xmath73 in all the models considered .",
    "these velocities are slightly lower than predicted in our previous work @xcite where we considered outflows in an isothermal potential , and more in line with observed agn outflows ( see discussion ) .",
    "importantly , as shown by @xcite , the outflows continue to expand significantly after the agn switches off .",
    "when the agn is active , the outflow is within @xmath74  kpc for @xmath62 , @xmath62 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the full cycle , for duty cycles of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "we suggest that this may explain the typical spatial extent of manifestly agn  driven outflows of several kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lack of such outflows observed beyond @xmath3  kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we return to this point in the discussion .",
    "the mass outflow rate , defined as the time derivative of the baryonic mass contained within @xmath20 , is also large both while the agn is active , and for some time after it switches off .",
    "the values reached , @xmath77  yr@xmath78 , should be seen as upper limits , because in reality a significant fraction of the gas is dense and resists being pushed away .",
    "nevertheless , large mass outflow rates need not coincide with agn activity , therefore the lack of an active nucleus in a given galaxy should not be taken as evidence that any observed outflow is not agn - driven .",
    "figures [ fig : lowen_velocities ] and [ fig : highen_velocities ] , show the same results as in figure [ fig : fiducial_velocities ] , but for different values of limiting agn input energy ",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 times the binding energy respectively .",
    "we see that if the agn is very efficient at quenching its own mass supply ( figure [ fig : lowen_velocities ] ) , the outflows are unable to escape from the halo completely and stall at a few tens to @xmath81  kpc , oscillating afterwards ( see the bottom panel ) .",
    "the agn switches off before any outflow escapes beyond @xmath82  kpc , so we do not expect to see outflows with an active agn at radii @xmath83kpc .",
    "conversely , a long  lasting agn episode ( figure [ fig : highen_velocities ] ) clears gas out more easily .",
    "the outflow maintains a velocity @xmath84 even at @xmath85mpc .",
    "in this case , the fraction of outflows within @xmath86kpc while the agn is active is @xmath62 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the four duty cycles . although some of these outflows do get outside @xmath86kpc with the agn still active , the fractions are still significantly lower than the @xmath90 expected for an outflow moving at a constant velocity out to @xmath91mpc .",
    "we also tested how outflows behave in galaxies with different masses .",
    "figures [ fig : highmass_velocities ] and [ fig : lowmass_velocities ] show the results for galaxies with halo mass @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we keep the same ratios of @xmath94 and @xmath95 as well as gas fractions .",
    "the outflows behave very similarly at early times for all halo masses .",
    "this happens because in the central parts of the galaxy ( small @xmath20 ) the kinetic terms in the equation of motion ( eq . [ eq : eom ] ) dominate the gravity terms , so the outflow expansion depends mainly on the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "but the binding energy goes as @xmath97 , so the time for which the agn is active is @xmath3 times higher for the @xmath98 halo . in the @xmath99 simulation , we allow the agn to remain active for long enough to inject @xmath80 times the gravitational binding energy of the gas into the outflow to ensure gas escape , so the activity is @xmath100 times shorter than in the fiducial model .    in low ",
    "mass halo models , the outflow has only expanded to a few kpc by the time the agn switches off , and later coasts with a gradually decreasing velocity . outside @xmath3kpc",
    "the outflow velocity drops below @xmath101 , making it very difficult to detect .",
    "conversely , in models with high  mass halos the fraction of outflows within @xmath102  kpc during phases of agn activity is @xmath103 , @xmath63 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the four agn duty cycles , respectively .",
    "the outflow velocity reaches @xmath106 before the agn switches off for the final time , so in this case , outflowing gas would be detectable out to large distances .",
    "so far we have discussed the expansion of an outflow driven by a flickering , agn whose total energy output is limited .",
    "we now consider the effects of the outflow pressure on the galaxy disc .",
    "we set up a disc extending from @xmath107 to @xmath108  kpc in radius , with an exponentially decreasing radial density profile ( consistent with observations , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a scale length of @xmath80  kpc and a total mass @xmath109 .",
    "we consider several values of the disc gas fraction @xmath110 : @xmath62 , for a system at high redshift ; @xmath111 , for a galaxy which has formed roughly half of its stars ( fiducial model ) ; and @xmath63 and @xmath64 , representing galaxies in the local universe .",
    "we calculate the star formation rate based on the volumetric kennicutt ",
    "schmidt relation : @xmath112 which can be recast for simplicity into a relation based on surface densities : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the star formation efficiency per dynamical time , @xmath115 is the gas volume density , @xmath116 is the gas surface density and @xmath117  pc is the scale height of the disc .",
    "we choose a value for the scale height which gives the appropriate scaling for the kennicutt ",
    "schmidt relation @xcite .    external compression caused by",
    "the passing outflow can stimulate star formation in the disc by reducing the effective dynamical time of star - forming clouds @xcite .",
    "we parameterize this as @xmath118,\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the disc pressure at radius @xmath120 , and @xmath121 is a free parameter of the model .",
    "@xmath122 is the external pressure acting upon the disc ( see below ) , which may be higher or lower than the disc pressure , but would act as an additional compressive term either way . in the simplest case , where external pressure is added linearly to the gravitational energy density , @xmath123 , but effects such as pressure instabilities following passage of a shock wave @xcite and/or the formation of instabilities behind the shockwave @xcite may decrease ( @xmath124 ) or increase ( @xmath125 ) the sfr enhancement respectively .    to calculate the external pressure we consider the outflow to be composed of two regions : inside the contact discontinuity , the pressure is constant and equal to @xmath126 , while outside the discontinuity it changes linearly between @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where the two pressures are calculated as in ( cf .",

    "in writing the expression of @xmath131 , we make an assumption that the radius of the outer shock is @xmath132 times the radius of the contact discontinuity .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption so long as the velocity of the outflow is significantly higher than the sound speed in the gas ( cf .",
    "we plot the evolution of @xmath131 with time and radius in the top and bottom panels of figure [ fig : fiducial_pressures ] , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the radiation pressure @xmath133 is @xmath134 times lower than @xmath131 even when @xmath135 , i.e. the outflow has a considerably higher pressure than the radiation field driving it .",
    "we give first the results of the fiducial model ( disc gas fraction @xmath111 ) with four agn duty cycles , as above .",
    "figure [ fig : fiducial_sfr ] shows the rates of induced star formation ( thick lines ) as functions of time .",
    "the thin lines represent the ` spontaneous ' star formation rate @xmath136 , i.e. that given by integrating the ks law ( eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma_sfr_sp ] ) over the whole disc ; this sfr decreases with time as gas is consumed in the disc . in the model with continuous agn activity ( black solid line ) ,",
    "induced star formation keeps growing until the agn switches off at @xmath137  myr , but never reaches the level of spontaneous star formation , falling short by about a factor of 2 .",
    "the situation is similar for the lower agn duty cycles , except that there the induced sfr fluctuates significantly between the ` on ' and ` off ' phases of the agn .",
    "this suggests that agn ",
    "induced star formation would be difficult to detect in an unresolved galaxy where only the integrated sfr could be estimated .",
    "if the galaxy disc can be resolved , agn effects upon star formation are more easily detected .",
    "figure [ fig : fiducial_sfr_radial ] shows the radial sfr density profiles of spontaneous ( thick solid line ) and induced ( thin lines ) star formation at different times from 1 to 30  myr .",
    "as expected , the induced sfr at a given radius decreases with time as the outflow expands and the pressures at the centre and the contact discontinuity drop . the induced sfr increases with radius out to the contact discontinuity at all times .",
    "this happens because even though the outflow pressure is uniform inside the contact discontinuity , the internal disc pressure decreases with decreasing @xmath138 and radius , so the outflow pressure becomes more significant .",
    "the outflow - to - disc pressure ratio increases from typically negligible values close to the centre to @xmath139 at the outer edge of the outflow .",
    "conversely , as long as the agn is active , the pressure at the outer shock decays with time more slowly than the pressure at the contact discontinuity because of the increase in outflow velocity , so the ratio of induced sfr density at the outermost point in the disc affected by the outflow to the induced sfr density at the contact discontinuity increases with time .",
    "together , these effects lead to a situation where the star formation enhancement is more significant in the outskirts of the disc than the centre .",
    "we show this result in figure [ fig : fiducial_burstmax ] , where we plot the maximum ratio of the value @xmath140 at every radius in the disc attained before the agn finally switches off . in the central kiloparsec",
    ", this ratio decreases with increasing radius and is only of order a few , but beyond @xmath141  kpc , depending on @xmath54 , it starts growing and reaches a value @xmath142 at @xmath143  kpc , growing slightly faster with decreasing agn duty cycle .",
    "the fiducial models reveal that agn outflows can significantly increase the galactic disc sfr within the central kiloparsec and outside @xmath3  kpc , but the effect on integrated sfr parameters is only moderate .",
    "we next consider the effects of an agn outflow upon galaxy discs with different gas fractions .",
    "we present results only for a model with @xmath144 , as we believe this to be the most likely of the four agn duty cycles we investigate ( see section [ sec : detect ] , below ) , and models with other values of @xmath54 show qualitatively similar behaviour ( see figure [ fig : fiducial_sfr ] ) .",
    "the expected trend with changing gas density is that the spontaneous sfr decreases as @xmath145 , while the induced sfr decreases only as @xmath146 .",
    "the ratio of the two increases with decreasing gas fraction as @xmath147 .",
    "figure [ fig : lowgas_sfr ] shows the star formation histories of models with four different gas fractions . as before , thin lines are spontaneous star formation , while thick ones show induced sfr . as expected , the spontaneous star formation rate declines as @xmath148 .",
    "the induced star formation rate declines slightly faster than @xmath149 , mainly because gas is completely consumed in some annuli of the disc in the lower density simulations , further reducing the integrated sfr . for gas fractions @xmath150 and @xmath151 ,",
    "corresponding to initial disc gas masses of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , the induced sfr is higher than the spontaneous sfr for several myr .",
    "importantly , the sfr enhancement persists after the agn switches off , as the outflow is still moving through the galaxy .",
    "so in gas  poor galaxy discs agn activity may induce starbursts which might be visible even in integrated sfr data as offsets from the ks relation .    the ratio of induced to spontaneous sfr is presented in figure [ fig : lowgas_burstmax ] .",
    "the expected trend is visible there as well , with induced starbursts in low ",
    "density galaxy discs increasing the star formation efficiency by more than an order of magnitude from the centre to the outskirts .",
    "all four models show qualitatively identical behaviour .",
    "the ratio decreases out to @xmath100  kpc and then increases further out .",
    "the bump at @xmath154  kpc appears because the agn switches off when the outflow has expanded to that distance , and so the outflow pressure begins to drop rapidly .",
    "given that the precise effect of the outflow compression upon the ism is uncertain , we test four different power  law indices @xmath121 for the calculation of the induced sfr ( eq . [ eq : ind_sfr ] ) .",
    "the results for @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 are shown in figure [ fig : varbeta_sfr ] . as expected",
    ", the induced sfr is higher for higher values of @xmath121 . if @xmath155 , i.e. the disc resists compression via processes other than star formation feedback , the induced sfr is @xmath158 times lower than in the fiducial model . on the other hand , @xmath159 produces induced sfr becoming higher than the spontaneous sfr at the peak at @xmath160  myr .",
    "this induced sfr value is a factor @xmath161 higher than in the fiducial model for the first @xmath3  myr .",
    "later , as the outflow expands to the disc outskirts , sfr induction is so efficient that the total induced sfr begins to rise with time .",
    "the second peak at @xmath162  myr represents the time when gas is completely consumed in some disc annuli around @xmath163  kpc .",
    "as star formation stops there , the total induced sfr drops significantly as well .",
    "the radial induced starburst plot ( figure [ fig : varbeta_burstmax ] ) shows the same qualitative behaviour for all three models , with the weakest starburst induced just outside the bulge ( @xmath164  kpc ) and increasing both inward and outward .",
    "even a reduced  efficiency ( @xmath165 ) sfr induction can result in a noticeable starburst at @xmath166  kpc  the derived star formation efficiency is an order of magnitude greater than predicted by the ks law .",
    "the extreme ratios achieved for the enhanced  efficiency ( @xmath159 ) induction model provoke rapid consumption of gas in the outskirts of the disc , and such powerful starbursts may be difficult to detect because of their short lifetimes .",
    "by considering the fraction of agn host galaxies which have not yet been ionised by the x ",
    "rays and uv from the nucleus , @xcite infer that agn phases typically last only @xmath167  yr .",
    "a similar result is reached by considering the time required to accrete a disc with outer edge ( and hence mass ) bounded by self - gravity @xcite . in our model , a single short phase like this is certainly not enough to inflate a massive outflow , so multiple phases of agn activity are required .",
    "our results depend on the fraction of time that the agn is active , and we consider simple arguments constraining the possible values of this fraction .    given the observed fraction of galaxies which are active ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we should have @xmath168 averaged over the age of the galaxy .",
    "a similar fraction comes from the soltan argument @xcite .",
    "if an smbh grows from stellar @xmath169 to its present mass , it must spend at least @xmath170 salpeter times accreting material .",
    "this duration is @xmath171",
    "myr@xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the hubble time .",
    "however , as the galaxy evolves , the frequency of agn activity evolves as well . at high redshift",
    "there is a lot of gas available to feed the smbh and the galaxy may be active more often , while at low redshift it is hardly ever active .",
    "the phase of gas ejection via a massive outflow marks the end of the high  activity phase of galaxy evolution , and so should be marked by a typical @xmath54 larger than the long - term average .",
    "so our simulations with @xmath174 represent a lower limit to the expected agn fraction at this stage of galaxy evolution .",
    "we expect @xmath175 to be more representative of reality , but the actual value is uncertain .",
    "our results then suggest that massive outflows are typically detected close to agn because agn switch off for good by the time outflows move far out from the nucleus .",
    "outflow signatures might be detectable around inactive galaxies at higher distances than around active galaxies , however as the outflow expands without driving , its density and velocity decrease and it becomes progressively more difficult to detect .",
    "outflows might also be detectable further from the agn in more massive galaxies than in lower  mass ones , where the agn needs to be active for longer and drive the outflow further away to ensure quenching of the mass supply .",
    "another interesting consequence of having @xmath176 is that even in the central parts of galaxies , agn - driven outflows might often be detected without the presence of the driving agn itself .",
    "these outflows might be erroneously identified as driven by star - formation activity .",
    "therefore , we predict that a larger fraction of outflows happen due to agn activity than expected from a naive interpretation of observations .",
    "it is important to consider how these results depend on the assumptions we made regarding the model .",
    "real outflows are not uniform nor spherically symmetric , therefore there is a spread of radii at which the outflow is observed at any given time .",
    "the spread is mediated by rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite and by the presence of dense material in the undisturbed ism , thus the outflowing gas should be seen both closer to the agn and further away from it than the formal radius of the contact discontinuity .",
    "the dense molecular gas , which is the usual tracer of these outflows , is more likely to lag behind the contact discontinuity than ahead of it ( see , e.g. , the numerical simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore our conclusion that outflows should be detected close to their parent agn is only strengthened .",
    "another issue is the total energy input by the agn required to shut off its own accretion . in principle",
    ", the dense gas in the galaxy might not be removed even if the outflow clears the diffuse gas , and thus agn might still be fed by infalling clouds .",
    "however , several processes might prevent long - term feeding of an agn after a large - scale outflow is driven away :    * the fraction of dense gas in galaxy bulges is not very large to begin with , @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , the outflow removes more than half of the material that might eventually feed the agn . * the outflow moves past molecular clouds and either disperses them @xcite or compresses them and enhances star formation @xcite , further depleting the amount of dense gas available to feed the agn .",
    "* once the diffuse gas is gone , molecular gas is not replenished any more .",
    "taken together , these points suggest that most of the agn feeding reservoir is depleted , or at least significantly diminished , by the large - scale outflow .",
    "in addition , our choice for basing the total agn energy release on the binding energy of the gas is consistent with numerical hydrodynamical simulations which suggest that dark matter halo masses , and hence the binding energies of those haloes , are the most important parameter setting the mass of the smbh @xcite . therefore we are confident in suggesting that once the agn outflow unbinds most of the gas from the galaxy , the agn switches off , essentially , forever .",
    "starbursts induced by the agn outflow are stronger in the central kiloparsec compared with the intermediate regions ( figures [ fig : fiducial_burstmax ] , [ fig : lowgas_burstmax ] and [ fig : varbeta_burstmax ] ) .",
    "this happens because the outflow pressure is very high there , while the disc gas density , and hence its pressure , does not vary strongly within the central scale length .",
    "these sub  kpc scales fall within the bulge of the galaxy , and correspond to locations of nuclear gas and stellar rings seen in many barred galaxies .",
    "gas in the rings may be directly affected by the radial push of the agn wind @xcite , but could also be compressed vertically and produce strong bursts of star formation , as observed @xcite .",
    "however , any such burst would probably be short , lasting for only a few myr before the nuclear ring relaxes to a baseline state , and so is probably detectable only simultaneously with agn activity or soon after the agn has switched off .",
    "bulge stars and gas may also mask the effect of the outflow on the nuclear gas ring , hampering simple interpretation of the observations .      in the outskirts of galaxy discs ,",
    "gas density is low , resulting in low pressure and low spontaneous star formation rate density .",
    "therefore , even though the induced star formation rate density decreases as well ( see figure [ fig : fiducial_sfr_radial ] ) , the ratio between the two grows once the outflow moves beyond @xmath100  kpc ( see figure [ fig : fiducial_burstmax ] ) .",
    "outside @xmath178  kpc , this ratio is more than an order of magnitude .",
    "such an offset from the typical values predicted by the ks law should be easily detected , provided that star formation in the galaxy is spatially resolved .",
    "some examples of such galaxies might be the ring galaxies such as the cartwheel .",
    "detection of rings of star formation with very high star formation efficiency in galactic outskirts might be taken as evidence of recent ( less than a few times @xmath179  yr ) episode of nuclear activity in the galaxy , especially since the star formation efficiency generally tends to decrease in galactic outskirts @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found evidence that star formation in galaxy discs might be quenched from the inside out .",
    "this quenching might simply be the result of faster gas depletion in the central parts of the galaxy due to differences in dynamical time .",
    "on the other hand , starbursts induced by agn outflows might enhance this effect .",
    "the induced star formation rate depends strongly on the outflow pressure , which , in turn , depends on its velocity ( see figure [ fig : fiducial_pressures ] ) . as a result , when the outflow is driven by a flickering agn , induced star formation rate rises periodically during the active phases , and decays during the inactive phases , even though the outflow itself keeps expanding ( see figures [ fig : fiducial_sfr ] , [ fig : lowgas_sfr ] and [ fig : varbeta_sfr ] ) . during each active phase",
    ", the outflow encompasses a greater part of the disc and leads to faster consumption of gas there .",
    "if the gas fraction in the disc is already low , the induced star formation might consume gas and quench star formation in the disc from the inside out .",
    "this process would manifest itself afterward by a radial gradient of stellar ages , however , since the outflow expands at a few hundred km / s , i.e. covers 1 kpc in a few myr , the gradient might be too shallow to detect easily .",
    "one more effect that the outflow might have upon a galaxy gas disc is causing it to flare in response to the outflow passage .",
    "this can be seen by considering the following simple argument .",
    "the pressure wave induced by the passing outflow moves vertically through the disc with a velocity @xmath180 and takes a time @xmath181 to reflect back to the edge of the disc . in this time",
    ", the edge of the outflow has moved outward a distance @xmath182 where @xmath20 is the original outflow location .",
    "putting in typical values @xmath183 , @xmath184 , we find that @xmath185 , i.e. the outflow expands to twice the initial radius by the time the induced shockwave reflects back to the edge of the disc . at the edge ,",
    "the shockwave now encounters outflow pressure which is a factor @xmath186 lower than the pressure which drove the shockwave .",
    "assuming that the shockwave did not lose a significant fraction of its energy ( and pressure ) during its vertical passage through the disc , it causes the disc to expand until the pressure approximately equilibrates .",
    "the expansion factor in disc thickness is comparable to the pressure ratio , i.e. @xmath187 . given that the external pressure becomes progressively more dominant over disc internal pressure as the outflow expands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fiducial_burstmax ] and section [ sec : outskirts ] ) , disc expansion should be more prominent in the outer parts of the disc , leading to flaring qualitatively consistent with observations .",
    "in recent years , several authors investigated agn - triggered star formation in galaxy discs .",
    "@xcite provides estimates of the star formation rate enhancement due to increased pressure , with general results very similar to ours .",
    "the conclusions of that paper state that quasar - mode feedback should be able to produce such increased pressures , although the focus of the paper was on jet - induced pressure increase . we show that high pressures , similar to the fiducial values assumed by @xcite , are a plausible result of agn wind - driven outflows .",
    "numerical simulations have so far considered mainly compression of galaxy discs by agn jet - inflated bubbles @xcite . although these simulations consider significantly different physical processes from ours , the general results are qualitatively similar . in particular , @xcite found that a jet - driven outflow in a clumpy medium produces a bubble which expands and compresses a turbulent galaxy disc , leading to enhancement of the star formation rate by a factor of a few from the baseline undisturbed disc sfr .",
    "@xcite found a stronger sfr enhancement , but investigated a longer - duration evolution of a model system , in which a jet - driven cocoon cools down and falls back on to the galaxy disc . our results ,",
    "therefore , provide a somewhat different mechanism for inducing higher rates of star formation in a galaxy disc , one which operates on timescales of 1 - 100 myr .",
    "however , more detailed simulations are required in order to distinguish the predictions of this model from those mentioned above .",
    "we have used a largely analytic model to follow the evolution of a spherically  symmetric , energy - driven agn outflow expanding in a realistic galaxy environment with an nfw halo and a hernquist bulge .",
    "we showed that if that the nucleus remains active only long enough to inject enough energy into the gas to unbind it , then the outflow can only be detected simultaneously with the agn when its radius is @xmath0  kpc , consistent with observations .",
    "outflows detected at greater distances in inactive galaxies may point to recent episodes of nuclear activity which have already ended .",
    "we also predict that outflows in more massive active galaxies will typically be detected at larger distances from the nucleus than those in lower  mass galaxies .",
    "we have shown that the outflow pressure can enhance star formation in a galaxy disc , producing observable differences in the normalisation of the ks law for the host , at least if the disc is not extremely gas  rich .",
    "the sfr enhancement is strongest in the centre and the outskirts of the disc ( @xmath188  kpc and @xmath189  kpc from the centre , respectively ) , so these regions are the best places to look for the effects of recent agn activity .",
    "in particular , enhanced star formation efficiency in the outskirts of a galaxy s disc can be used as another diagnostic of an agn phase within the last few times @xmath179  yr .",
