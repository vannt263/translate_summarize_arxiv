    "in this work , we will study the collider signatures of neutral , heavy , long - lived particles that decay to multiple charged particles and missing energy .",
    "such signatures are interesting for a variety of reasons .",
    "first , the combination of displaced decays , significant missing energy , and high invariant mass generally leads to extremely clean , nearly background - free channels .",
    "so such signatures can be excellent discovery channels for new physics .",
    "second , the presence of multiple charged particles generally allows for detailed reconstruction of the event kinematics , including the position and time of the displaced vertex .",
    "this in turn can be used to deduce the properties of the neutral parent particle , including its mass and lifetime .",
    "the prototypical scenario we have in mind is gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) with a long - lived general neutralino nlsp .",
    "the general neutralino nlsp is a mixture of bino , higgsino , and wino gauge eigenstates .",
    "if the nlsp has a significant higgsino or wino component , then it can have @xmath7 branching fractions to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the gravitino .",
    "subsequent decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath11 can then give rise to the signatures involving charged particles and missing energy .",
    "in particular , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 plus missing energy are all possible signatures . in this paper",
    ", we will focus primarily on the simplest and cleanest cases , namely @xmath17 with @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "for the purposes of discovery with early lhc data , we will also consider @xmath15 .    while higgsino and wino nlsps do not occur in minimal gauge mediation , they are perfectly reasonable possibilities in the context of general gauge mediation @xcite .",
    "higgsino nlsps also arise in the simplest extensions of minimal gauge mediation @xcite and can alleviate fine - tuning @xcite . for a review of minimal gauge mediation and its collider phenomenology , and many original references , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the nlsp lifetime is determined by the fundamental scale of susy breaking , @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 tev , the nlsp generally decays promptly , while for @xmath20 between @xmath22 tev , it mostly decays away from the primary vertex but inside the detector .",
    "promptly - decaying neutralino nlsps were considered some time ago at the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite . more recently in @xcite ,",
    "we have considered current tevatron limits on and future prospects for discovery of promptly - decaying general neutralino nlsps .",
    "in addition , the possibility of finding higgsino nlsps decaying promptly to boosted higgses using jet substructure was recently discussed in @xcite .    by contrast , displaced @xmath0 s from nlsp decays are not as well - studied .",
    "the possibility of such signatures was first raised in @xcite .",
    "motivated by minimal gauge mediation ( where @xmath23 ) , ambrosanio and blair @xcite examined this signature at a hypothetical 500 gev @xmath24 linear collider , focusing on its uses for the post - discovery study of supersymmetry . as far as we know , our paper is the first to study this signature in detail at hadron colliders , and to examine its potential as a discovery channel for new physics .    on the experimental side ,",
    "long - lived neutralino nlsps have received relatively little attention , save for the case of a bino nlsp ( again , motivated by minimal gauge mediation ) , which decays dominantly to photons .",
    "such decays have been searched for at cdf @xcite using the em timing system installed early in run ii @xcite .",
    "preliminary studies of non - pointing photons have been carried out by the cms @xcite and atlas collaborations @xcite .",
    "both cms and atlas explored the possibility of using their electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) to determine that photons were non - pointing ( i.e.  originate from a direction other than that of the primary vertex ) , while atlas additionally explored the use of timing information in the ecal and reconstructed tracks from photon conversions .    by adapting the atlas work on non - pointing photons to the case of @xmath12",
    ", we will see that a combination of the ecal and tracking can lead to precise determination of the neutralino mass and lifetime .",
    "such displaced decays allow us to reconstruct the full kinematics of an event in ways that are simply impossible in events where all decays are prompt , or where the decay products are neutral .",
    "for comparison , the study @xcite had to work with a longer a decay chain @xmath25 , use photon conversions for extra directional information , and make use of known masses to fully reconstruct events .",
    "( for another recent discussion of the use of long - lived particles for full kinematic reconstruction , see @xcite . )",
    "we also investigate @xmath26 final states using the muon spectrometer .",
    "these play a complementary role to @xmath27 final states ; by analyzing both electron and muon final states , we can cover a much wider range of possible nlsp lifetimes .",
    "the muon chambers are at the largest distance from the interaction point , and at both lhc experiments full 3d tracking information is recorded . using this information , plus potential timing information from the muon system",
    ", a full kinematic reconstruction of standalone muons can be done in principle , extending the detailed event study to much longer lifetimes than is possible with electrons alone .    in reconstructing events ,",
    "we are limited at short lifetimes by the timing resolution , which at best is @xmath28 .",
    "we stress that this is the best any proposed study can do for shorter lifetimes without having to rely upon additional kinematic information about the masses .",
    "however , if one is interested in discovery of new physics and not full event reconstruction , there is additional reach at short lifetimes , since here it is not necessary to use timing information at all . given that the decays we investigate come from a @xmath0 or @xmath11 , the high invariant mass or large separation of any charged particles produced at a displaced vertex eliminate backgrounds such as conversions .",
    "we will show that including information from the inner silicon layers of an lhc detector opens up discovery possibilities for delayed decays that have hitherto not been stressed for the lhc .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section [ sec : lhcgen ] , we will discuss the detector geometry of atlas , as well as the ability of different detector components to perform specialized measurements useful for long - lifetime searches , such as arrival times or the direction of a particle passing through a subdetector . in section [ sec : discovery ]",
    ", we discuss the prospects for a discovery at the lhc in early data ( 1 fb@xmath29 taken at 7 tev ) . for discovery , we are not interested in detailed reconstruction of events so much as simply establishing a signal that is distinct from standard model backgrounds . by making use of the pixel detector , the trt , or the muon spectrometer , in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath15 final states , we show that a range of six orders of magnitude in lifetimes can be covered , from @xmath30 mm . in section [ sec : atlasrecon ] , we turn to the prospects for doing more detailed event reconstruction with the atlas detector using 10 fb@xmath29 of data at 14 tev .",
    "either the ecal together with the trt or the muon spectrometer alone allow full kinematic reconstruction of decays based on timing and directional information .",
    "we show that masses , lifetimes , and angular distributions can be measured accurately . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we give a discussion of our results , including how they generalize to cms .",
    "appendix [ sec : tevatron ] gives a summary of existing tevatron searches for long lifetime and presents a possible search that could discover long - lived nlsps at d@xmath31 .",
    "in the rest of the paper , we will discuss the capabilities for atlas to identify displaced nlsp decays into @xmath27 or @xmath26 ( and in section [ sec : discovery ] also @xmath15 ) along with a gravitino .",
    "these can serve as benchmark scenarios for more general long - lived neutral particle decays . a schematic view of an interesting decay of this type is shown in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "the solid black lines denote additional jets , tracks , etc .",
    "that can be used to find the primary vertex .",
    "these can come from e.g.  initial state radiation or decays of directly - produced colored sparticles to the nlsp .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]      in scenarios with a late - decaying particle , the collider signatures are determined by the interplay of kinematics and geometry .",
    "we show an example of such a geometry in figure [ fig : atlasgeom ] .",

    "lifetime . here",
    "the nlsp was taken to have @xmath32 gev and was assumed to come from decays of 600 gev gluinos .",

    "[ fig : decayloc ] , we plot ( at left ) the relationship between lifetime and susy - breaking scale and ( at right ) the fraction of decays occurring within different regions of the detectors at atlas as a function of the lifetime .",
    "( a plot similar to the right - hand plot , generated for hidden - valley models , has appeared in refs .",
    "the general pattern is this : at short lifetimes , nearly all of the decays occur within the inner detector .",
    "consequently , nearly all the decays leave tracks in the trt . as the lifetime becomes of order meters , 10 - 20% of the decays can occur in the outer layers of the detector : the electromagnetic or hadronic central calorimeters , the forward calorimeters , or the muon detectors .",
    "however , at very long lifetimes , most nlsps will escape the detector altogether .",
    "the distribution of decay locations for those nlsps that decay inside the detector is essentially flat , i.e.  it depends only on the relative volumes of the different subdetectors .",
    "analogous plots can be made for cms and for the tevatron detectors .",
    "essentially the only qualitative difference these have with fig .",
    "[ fig : decayloc ] is the fraction of decays in the muon detectors . at atlas ,",
    "the very large volume of the muon system allows it to surpass the number of decays in the inner detector for lifetimes of around 6 meters or more . at the other detectors ,",
    "decays in the muon system are somewhat less common , but still a useful tool at long lifetime .",
    "the general lesson we learn here is that if a substantial fraction of events have nlsp decays anywhere in the detector , they will have nlsps decaying in the inner detector .",
    "thus we expect that the decay products will pass through the calorimeters , and potentially leave tracks .",
    "it is also interesting to look for anomalous tracks in the muon detectors .",
    "decays in the ecal or hcal are comparatively rare , and they offer less precision directional information , so we will not pursue the use of such decays for reconstructing events . of course , ultimately , one would hope to find decays in all parts of the detector , and use their relative rates to help characterize lifetimes .",
    "when focusing on @xmath27 , the goal is to use as much precision information as possible from the ecal and the trt to reconstruct the decay chain and fit masses and other kinematic information .",
    "there are two sets of resolutions we will be interested in : those pertaining to how well the ecal can measure energy , timing , and pointing information , and how well the trt can in principle be used for finding displaced vertices",
    ". we will use resolutions reported in the atlas note @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which is a detailed follow - up on an earlier paper examining the capability of atlas to find non - pointing photons in minimal gauge mediation @xcite .",
    ".measured parameters and their resolutions in the atlas detector .",
    "the @xmath37 subscripts refer to a position or absolute time measured in the detector .",
    "the @xmath38 subscripts refer to the direction of the energy / momentum as measured by the detector .",

    "we also show , in the background , the results of a fit using only information from the ecal .",
    "notice that the ecal - only efficiency is comparable , as a similar number of events are reconstructed , but the resolution is noticeably worse , and a typical event will be reconstructed far more accurately if the trt is used .",
    "this highlights the importance of understanding how to construct standalone trt tracks originating at a given calorimeter cell that do not necessarily point near the primary vertex .",
    "figure [ fig : mufit ] shows a similar result for reconstruction using the muon spectrometer . here",
    "the lifetime is 14 m , a factor of 40 larger than that shown in figure [ fig : ecaltrtfit ] . for this lifetime",
    "there are 286 well - reconstructed events at point lhs and 150 at point hhs .     for a higgsino - like nlsp , using the ecal and the trt . here",
    "we have restricted to events with @xmath43 reconstructed within 10 gev of the true value , and performed a nonlinear least - squares fit to a gaussian .",
    "the points are lhs and hhs , and the gaussian fit is accurate within 1 gev for both . the gray histograms and dotted lines in the background show the ecal - only reconstruction and corresponding gaussian fit.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   for a higgsino - like nlsp , using the ecal and the trt .",

    "our cuts require delays of 0.3 ns for reconstruction with the ecal , and decay radii of 500 mm for use of the muon spectrometer , so finding a sample of well - reconstructed events with a clean mass peak automatically implies that one is viewing events with a long lifetime .",
    "however , the distribution of reconstructed lifetimes is shaped by multiple effects .",
    "first , the distribution of proper lifetimes @xmath44 is convolved with the effects of boost factors which depend on the mass of the _ produced _ particles ( like gluinos or squarks ) as well as the nlsp mass . on an event - by - event basis",
    ", the boost can be measured and corrected for , but with some error .",
    "second , the geometry of the detector imposes limitations ; for instance , for events reconstructed with the ecal , decays at @xmath45 ns will be too long - lived to be detected , so the tail of the distribution is chopped off .",
    "events at lifetimes that are too _ short _ are not reconstructible , so the beginning of the distribution is also shaped by cuts . as a result , very little remnant of an exponential distribution of proper times is left ( see figure [ fig : reconlengths ] ) .",
    "m ) and using the muon spectrometer ( at right , @xmath46 m).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   m ) and using the muon spectrometer ( at right , @xmath46 m).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the unknown spectrum presents a challenge , but given the good kinematic reconstruction of decays that we have shown is achievable , it seems likely that masses of squarks and gluinos can be measured well .",
    "the cross section also contains information about these masses .",
    "such mass determination problems are orthogonal to the subject of this paper , so we will not consider them in detail here .",
    "for the time being , we will simply assume that the unknown spectrum has been independently measured , so that the distribution of nlsp lifetimes can be simulated accurately .",
    "each , by @xmath47 fitting of the distribution of reconstructed times for each event .",
    "we show the point lhs , which has a large cross section , and for which the lifetime can be measured accurately .",
    "blue points are measured with electrons in the ecal+trt , whereas purple points are measured with the muon spectrometer.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    assuming that the spectrum has been measured , one can simulate a variety of different lifetimes and perform a @xmath47 fit to find the true lifetime .",
    "we show the results of such a fit in figure [ fig : timerecon ] .",
    "a wide range of lifetimes can be measured with @xmath48 accuracy .",
    "it is likely that one of the best tools for understanding lifetime is the ratio of events measured in different parts of the detector , as we discussed in section [ sec : geom ] , provided that the efficiencies and kinematics are understood .",
    "for relatively short lifetimes , it would interesting to consider how well the silicon can be used to measure @xmath33 , although such events would not be fully reconstructible as they would occur at times to short to use the ecal timing system .",
    "so far we have focused on reconstructing basic kinematic information like masses and decay widths .",
    "more detailed information can be obtained by studying angular distributions .",
    "for example , a neutral wino decays to transversely polarized @xmath0 bosons , whereas a neutral higgsino decays to gravitino plus longitudinal @xmath0 . in the decay chain @xmath49 , the invariant mass @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angle in the @xmath0 rest frame between the @xmath52 direction and the boost direction from the @xmath53 rest frame to the @xmath0 rest frame . in this variable , the expected angular distribution is @xmath54 for transversely polarized z bosons and @xmath55 for longitudinally polarized z bosons .",
    "similar techniques were discussed in the context of the hypothetical ilc in @xcite . note that this is an idealized theoretical prediction that will be shaped by cuts .",

    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that these distributions differ at the 99% confidence level .",
    "this is based on points lhs and lws , i.e. two points with a 600 gev gluino to enhance the production cross section .",
    "the lifetime is 1 ns and we have used ecal and trt information in the reconstruction .",
    "in addition to the cuts we took to define a  well - reconstructed event \" in section [ sec : accdefrecon ] , we further keep only events for which the reconstructed value of @xmath61 is within 10 gev of the best - fit value , which gives a cleaner sample .",
    "this simple example illustrates that we can move beyond studying just masses and branching ratios to actually probing the structure of the lagrangian .",
    "in this paper we have established that the lhc can discover long - lived neutral particles decaying to @xmath0 bosons , with lifetimes ranging from about 0.1 mm to 100 meters , using just 1 fb@xmath29 of data at 7 tev .",
    "we have seen that this is a clean , well - motivated , and powerful discovery channel for new physics , and it is one that has up till now been neglected at the lhc .",
    "thus it presents an exciting prospect that could be put to the test within the next two years .",
    "because our long - lived particles decay to multiple charged particles , and these particles arrive with a time delay in a direction that does not point back to the beamline , the problem of reconstructing the event kinematics becomes highly overconstrained . for lifetimes from a few centimeters to tens of meters",
    ", we have shown that the ecal and trt or the muon spectrometer provide enough precision information to allow masses , lifetimes , and even angular distributions to be accurately measured with 10 fb@xmath29 of data at 14 tev .",
    "this should be contrasted with prompt decays or even displaced decays to photons , where much less information is available , and one must work much harder to reconstruct these quantities .    we have not necessarily exhausted the full set of options for using the atlas detector to study long lifetimes ; for instance , the tile ( hadronic ) calorimeter can measure arrival time with resolution ranging from hundreds of picoseconds to 1.5 ns depending on energy @xcite . in general , we expect that decays inside a calorimeter will offer less precise directional information than those in a tracking system , but they can still be interesting both for discovery and to get a better understanding of lifetime by counting decays in different detector components .",
    "our results have been specialized to atlas , but most of them carry over to cms with minimal changes .",
    "perhaps the most important difference is simply the volume of the two detectors : cms has a radius of 7.3 meters @xcite , whereas the muon spectrometer at atlas extends out to 10 meters .",
    "thus cms can be expected to have a somewhat more limited ability to probe very long lifetimes . aside from the geometry , however , cms should perform well in measuring standalone muons from long - lifetime decays , with full 3d directional information , and a timing resolution of @xmath62 ns from rpcs @xcite .",
    "the cms detector also has an em timing system , which like that of atlas has a resolution of 100 ps for em showers ( and has achieved synchronization across crystals of 500 ps with early events ) @xcite .",
    "the ability of the cms ecal to measure non - pointing angles is more limited , but at a crude level it is possible @xcite . on the other hand , whereas the atlas trt provides information only in the @xmath63 plane , at cms the first two layers of both the tib (  tracker inner barrel \" ) and tob (  tracker outer barrel \" ) are stereo @xcite , so provided a decay is prompt enough , the tracker can be used to provide 3d directional information in place of pointing information from the calorimeter .",
    "the stochastic term in the cms ecal is quite good , @xmath64 , although as with standard photon or electron measurements at cms , the large amount of material in the tracker could complicate precise measurement .",
    "it is interesting to consider to what extent the reconstruction techniques we discuss can be pushed to shorter lifetimes .",
    "it is conceivable that future detector upgrades could have picosecond - resolution timing @xcite , giving two orders of magnitude improvement and allowing silicon to be used in place of pointing for 3d directional information .",
    "the use of such high - precision timing would essentially allow the entire discovery reach discussed in section [ sec : discovery ] to be accurately reconstructed along the lines of section [ sec : atlasrecon ] .",

    "we will focus on their discovery potential for general neutralino nlsps decaying to @xmath3 . currently , there are no tevatron analyses which directly search in this final state .",
    "however , several searches motivated by other theoretical considerations have the potential to indirectly constrain this scenario .",
    "cdf has performed two searches for a long - lived neutral particle decaying to a @xmath0 boson and possibly other particles , visible or invisible .",
    "these studies use well - reconstructed tracks found by the default algorithms , so in particular , any particle that decays at a radius larger than @xmath62 cm would be missed .",

    "the first searched for @xmath66 in a 90 pb@xmath29 sample @xcite , whereas the second searched for @xmath67 in a 163 pb@xmath29 sample @xcite . both studies imposed a @xmath0 mass window cut and required a minimum @xmath68 , the distance in the transverse plane between the interaction point and the vertex where the lepton pair originates , of order 0.1 cm .",
    "both searches set limits of order 1 pb for lifetimes near 0.1 to 1 cm .",
    "d@xmath31  has carried out studies that offer more flexibility in the range of lifetimes probed , by not requiring standard track quality cuts .",
    "one study used 380 pb@xmath29 of data to search for a displaced @xmath69 pair @xcite , motivated by the nutev anomaly and rpv decays of a neutralino .",
    "the muons were required to have a minimum distance of closest approach of the tracks to any vertex in both the transverse plane ( 0.01 cm ) and the @xmath39 direction ( 0.1 cm ) , and were _ not _ required to leave silicon hits .",
    "this search required @xmath70 , which leads to its optimal reach being at lower masses than the @xmath0 , so it is not optimal for gauge mediation searches .",
    "the limit was about 0.1 pb for a lifetime of about 1 cm .",
    "more interestingly for us , d@xmath31  has undertaken a study with 1.1 fb@xmath29 of data that searches for displaced electrons or photons using pointing  @xcite and not using tracking .",
    "the pointing measurement gives full 3d information on the direction of an object interacting with the em calorimeter , by fitting a line through five shower positions .",
    "this allows a great deal more flexibility in the range of lifetimes probed than studies that rely on tracking information .",
    "this is the only tevatron search that we are aware of which constrains this scenario using timing or pointing .",
    "this search is sensitive to longer displacements ( @xmath71 cm ) than the tracking - based searches , and so it offers a complementary approach to the searches described above .",
    "since this search was again motivated at least partly by the @xmath72 scenario , the cuts were not optimized for gauge mediation .",
    "in particular , there was no requirement on missing energy , and consequently there was a nonzero expected background .",
    "we expect that with a hard met cut , the background could have been completely eliminated , so that with more data , this channel could become a clear discovery mode for gmsb .    to illustrate this we first reproduced the acceptances given in  @xcite for @xmath73 using a pythia simulation @xcite .",
    "we then calculated the number of events coming from direct production of a @xmath0-rich higgsino nlsp using the same cuts as in the previous study but including a met cut of 30 gev .. for higgsinos , the electrons will satisfy _ both _ a tight @xmath0 mass window cut and a hard met cut .",
    "we expect the combination of these will completely eliminate the background . ] in figure  [ fig : d0reach ] we plot the number of events in 10 fb@xmath29 at d@xmath31  as a function of lifetime and mass .",
    "we clearly see that d@xmath31  has the potential to discover gmsb for higgsino nlsps for larger lifetimes , assuming the background can be made negligible .",
    "note that since we are assuming only direct production of neutralinos and charginos , our result should be viewed as a conservative estimate of the reach , since any additional particles ( sleptons , gluinos , squarks ) will only add to the total rate for this inclusive search .",
    "although our paper is focused on signatures of displaced @xmath17 , for completeness sake , let us also briefly discuss various tevatron searches for other displaced final states .",
    "recently d@xmath31 , motivated by hidden valleys  @xcite , has looked for pairs of neutral long lived particles that decay into @xmath74 pairs , both with displaced vertices  @xcite .",
    "this study is sensitive to displacements between @xmath75 cm and @xmath76 cm .",
    "this study could be potentially very useful for bounding higgs - rich higgsino nlsps .",
    "unfortunately , qcd is the background for this search and it is quite large . once again , however , this search did not include a met cut . including a hard met cut could reduce the background significantly and with more data could turn this into a discovery mode .    using an em calorimeter timing system with a resolution of about 1 ns @xcite ,",
    "cdf has searched for long lived neutralinos in gmsb that decay into photons at large displacements in  @xcite . in minimal gauge mediation , this has its best reach for lifetimes of about 150 cm , excluding a bino mass of about 105 gev .",
    "this search could conceivably also be used to bound light higgsino or wino nlsps , where decays to heavier gauge bosons and higgses are phase - space suppressed .",
    "clearly , further studies using the em timing system of cdf would be useful and would be complementary to d@xmath31 s studies .",
    "interesting searches using em timing that could probe long - lived general neutralino nlsps include searches for out - of - time tracks or jets",
    ". another possibility would be to search in the single photon plus @xmath77 channel .",
    "making this an exclusive final state ( i.e.  vetoing on other activity in the event ) would be an interesting way to look for light higgsino or wino nlsps , where one decays outside the detector , while the other decays inside to @xmath78 .",
    "since higgsinos and winos ( in contrast to binos ) can be directly produced , there would not be complicated susy cascade decays giving rise to many high @xmath79 particles , and hence not much activity in the event other than the single photon plus missing energy .",
