    "individuals are observed sequentially . the problem of whether to accept an individual at the time that she is observed has a rich literature .",
    "the most celebrated version is the `` secretary problem , '' where the criterion is to select one individual and the objective is to maximize the probability that the best individual is chosen .",
    "this setting has been extended in various ways including selecting a limited number of individuals and basing the reward on the rank or score of individual(s ) selected .",
    "another extension that has received recent attention is to select a group of `` quality members . ''",
    "this might occur when a team of highly qualified professionals is assembled , for example , in an academic department or a consulting group in a specialized area .",
    "the goal is to find good rules for either accepting or rejecting each additional individual into the group at the time that the individual is observed .",
    "one such rule that has been studied is to add a new member to the group only if this will not decrease the average quality of the group , termed in the literature as the `` better than average selection rule . ''",
    "this tacitly assumes that `` quality '' is measurable .",
    "a generalization of the rule would be to only admit a new member whose score is say @xmath13 higher than the current average .",
    "we term the extended rules as `` @xmath2-better than average rules . ''",
    "these rules reduce to the better than average rule when @xmath1 , first considered by preater @xcite , but allows say for @xmath14 to produce a group that is even more progressively selective than when @xmath1 .",
    "the assumption that is commonly made is that the quality of the individuals are mutually independent from a common distribution .",
    "as the horizon , @xmath15 , tends to infinity we study the asymptotic behavior of the average quality of the group and the rate at which the group grows for the @xmath2-better than average rules .",
    "the @xmath2-better than average rules are considered in krieger , pollak and samuel - cahn @xcite , and the present paper , which can be read independently , can be considered its natural continuation . sequential selection of a `` good '' group , based only upon the relative ranks of the observations is considered in krieger , pollak and samuel - cahn @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the rules considered here can be implemented without knowledge of the underlying distribution , though their asymptotic behavior depends strongly on that distribution . for convenience , we assume that the first item is always selected",
    ". however , all asymptotic results remain correct if the selection process is adopted only after a core group of members already exists .",
    "also , the random variable is assumed to be nonnegative ( or the process begins with the first nonnegative observation ) , because negative averages multiplied by @xmath11 provide a lower level for inclusion .",
    "two quantities are of interest : the average quality , @xmath3 , of the group , after @xmath4 items have been retained , and @xmath5 , the time ( in terms of the number of observed items ) it takes to amass a group of size @xmath4 .",
    "our interest is in the asymptotics of these quantities , as @xmath16 .",

    "these mild conditions are satisfied in particular by the stretch exponential distributions with @xmath26 .",
    "it is easy to show that the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are close to each other in that @xmath29 .",
    "the convergence of @xmath24 is shown in section [ sec3 ] , where also the convergence of the sequence of expected values and variances of @xmath30 is established .",
    "the behavior of @xmath3 for @xmath11 is very different . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we show , under mild conditions , that for @xmath11 , @xmath31 converges a.s . to a finite positive random variable .",
    "the behavior of @xmath5 is discussed in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "it is shown that for stretch exponential random variables with @xmath32 , @xmath1 and every @xmath33 one has @xmath34 a.s .",
    "as @xmath16 , while @xmath35 a.s .",
    "when @xmath36 , @xmath37 converges to a finite positive random variable .",
    "the `` standardized '' variable @xmath38^{-1}\\ ] ] for @xmath12 is considered and has a very interesting behavior for the stretch exponential with @xmath8 . for different values of @xmath2",
    "we obtain different asymptotic behavior : we show that for @xmath39 the random variable @xmath40 converges to 1 a.s .",
    "for @xmath41 it converges to 1 in probability . for @xmath42",
    "the random variable @xmath43 converges in distribution to an exponential mean one distribution , while for @xmath44 the convergence in distribution is to a sum of conditionally independent exponential random variables .",
