    "in the age of ` big data ' , efficient data representation is an objective of an ever increasing importance .",
    "not only does it simplify the handling of the data due to the reduction of needed storage space or the possible speed - up of processing times .",
    "the knowledge of a ` good ' representation also gives valuable information about the structure of the data itself , simplifying certain processing tasks or even just enabling them in the first place .",
    "as an example we may think of the restoration of corrupted signals or the separation of several superimposed signals of distinct types .    often , the data of interest can be modeled in a linear space , for instance a hilbert space as exemplified by the lebesgue spaces of square - integrable functions . in this setting the standard approach for the representation of a signal",
    "is its expansion with respect to a fixed family of basic elements , a so - called dictionary for the data . in practice ,",
    "one usually needs to contend with approximations and therefore resorts to approximation schemes , i.e. , algorithms that deliver for each signal @xmath22 a sequence of approximants @xmath23 converging to the signal . a standard choice here is to use @xmath1-term approximations in the respective dictionary , i.e. , approximants being built from just @xmath1 dictionary elements .",
    "a main goal of approximation theory is the development of approximation schemes with a best possible speed of convergence , commonly quantified by the asymptotic decay of the approximation error @xmath24 as @xmath25 . with regard to @xmath1-term approximations ,",
    "the achievable rate is determined by the utilized dictionary in the background and one aims to find dictionaries providing high approximation rates for the data .",
    "such dictionaries are said to sparsely approximate the corresponding signals and clearly need to be chosen depending on the considered signal class .",
    "for efficient data representation it is therefore essential , first , to be able to precisely specify the type of data under consideration , e.g. , in the form of an appropriate model , and , second , to develop dictionaries , well adapted to the specific data class , providing sparse approximations .",
    "subsequently , we are interested in the sparse approximation of image data . in our investigation , we will always stay in the continuum setting , where images are as usual represented as functions supported on some compact image domain @xmath26 with values containing pixel information at the respective positions , such as e.g.  color or brightness information . being compactly supported and bounded , the image data can conveniently be modeled as a subset of the hilbert space @xmath27 , which in turn is considered as a subspace of @xmath28 .",
    "hence , we are in a concrete hilbert space scenario and can resort to the methodology described above , i.e. , we aim for appropriate image models and sparsifying dictionaries .    for the space @xmath27 the classic fourier systems constitute an orthonormal basis , providing a straight - forward procedure for representation . however , fourier systems work well only if the functions under consideration are smooth . for general images",
    "such smoothness assumptions are certainly not fulfilled .    as another popular representation system",
    "wavelets  @xcite come to mind . nowadays",
    ", they are one of the most widely used systems in applied harmonic analysis , with various applications ranging from signal compression ( e.g.  jpeg2000  @xcite ) and restoration  @xcite to pde solvers  @xcite . in particular , they have the ability to sparsely approximate functions , which are smooth apart from isolated point singularities . for general image data , however , such regularity assumptions are still too strict . a characteristic feature of images are edges , leading to curvilinear discontinuities in the data . with respect to such line singularities , wavelet systems do not perform optimally any more .",
    "the isotropy of their scaling prohibits an optimal resolution of these kind of anisotropic structures .    with the desire to specifically model the occurrence of edges , the concept of cartoon - like functions emerged",
    ". these are piecewise smooth functions featuring discontinuities along lower - dimensional manifolds , in our case along the @xmath29-dimensional edge curves of the image . based on such functions ,",
    "suitable models for natural images have been conceived and different model classes have been introduced . typically , these classes are characterized by a specific smoothness of the regions and by certain conditions on the separating edges . as examples ,",
    "let us mention the classic cartoons  @xcite with @xmath0 regularity of the regions and the discontinuity curves , or the horizon classes considered e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the achievable approximation rate for a class of cartoon - like functions essentially depends on the regularity of the cartoons , including both the smoothness of the edge curves and the smoothness of the regions in between .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath13 regularity of the regions and the separating edges with @xmath30 allows for an asymptotic rate of order @xmath16 . by information theoretic arguments",
    ", it has further been established that this rate can not be surpassed @xcite , at least in a class - wise sense .",
    "interestingly , the benchmark @xmath16 is the same for the class of so - called binary cartoons , i.e. , cartoon - like functions with constant regions , and it also does not change if one restricts to @xmath13 smooth functions without any edges .    with the model of cartoon - like functions at hand , let us turn again to the question of efficient image representation . in the past , a great amount of energy has been devoted to the effort of constructing dictionaries well - suited for cartoon approximation .",
    "thereby , many different paths have been pursued and the developed methods can be divided into two general categories : adaptive and nonadaptive methods .",
    "adaptive methods are by nature more flexible and have the inherent advantage of being able to adjust to the given data . on the downside ,",
    "the increased flexibility typically comes at the cost of higher computational complexity of the employed approximation and reconstruction schemes .",
    "some prominent examples of adaptive methods for image data are based on wedgelet dictionaries  @xcite and their higher - order relatives , so - called surflets  @xcite .",
    "they have been shown to reach the optimality bound @xmath16 for binary cartoons with @xmath13 regularity  @xcite .",
    "other notable dictionaries used for adaptive approximation include beamlets  @xcite , platelets  @xcite , and derivatives of wedgelets such as multiwedgelets  @xcite or smoothlets  @xcite .",
    "more recently , new adaptive schemes have emerged that use bases , e.g. , bandelets  @xcite , grouplets  @xcite , and tetrolets  @xcite .",
    "quasi - optimal approximation for @xmath13 cartoons with @xmath30 has been proved e.g.  in  @xcite for bandelets .",
    "nonadaptive methods are usually much simpler than adaptive schemes , at least from an algorithmic perspective .",
    "mainly , they are based on frames and the corresponding reconstruction formulas",
    ". an easy path to approximation is thus provided by simply thresholding the frame coefficients .",
    "surprisingly , despite the simplicity of such schemes , there exist frames with quasi - optimal approximation performance for certain cartoon classes .",
    "if the edges of the cartoons are straight , different variants of so - called ridgelet frames have been shown to yield quasi - optimal approximation  @xcite . originally , the notion of a ridgelet was introduced by cands  @xcite in 1998 , who defined them as bivariate ridge functions obtained by tensoring a univariate wavelet with a constant . since these ` pure ridgelets ' are not square - integrable , the concept was later modified in order to obtain frames or bases for @xmath28 . by giving them a slow decay along the ridge ,",
    "donoho constructed an orthonormal basis whose elements are called ` orthonormal ridgelets '  @xcite .",
    "their close relationship to the original concept has been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "another construction , based on directional scaling , goes back to grohs , providing tight frames @xcite .",
    "this kind of construction coincides with the concept of ` @xmath19-curvelets ' presented below .    to deal with curved edges",
    ", numerous types of frames have been developed .",
    "an important milestone was the introduction of the first generation of curvelets  @xcite by cands and donoho in 1999 .",
    "they represent the first frame to reach the optimal approximation order of @xmath2 for @xmath0 cartoons via simple thresholding . a modification of this system , the second generation of curvelets  @xcite , was introduced in 2002 by the same authors .",
    "it is based on a more elegant and simpler construction principle , yet features the same quasi - optimal approximation properties . following this early breakthrough",
    ", other constructions better suited for digital implementation were developed .",
    "let us mention contourlets  @xcite by do and vetterli and shearlets , whose construction goes back mainly to guo , kutyniok , labate , lim , and weiss .",
    "the first shearlet construction consisted of band - limited functions and was presented in  @xcite .",
    "later , more sophisticated shearlet systems were developed , such as e.g.  the well - localized band - limited parseval frame in @xcite or even systems of compactly supported shearlets  @xcite . like curvelets ,",
    "those systems provide quasi - optimal approximation for @xmath0 cartoons .",
    "for the classic band - limited shearlets this was established in  @xcite , for those with compact support in  @xcite .",
    "a common principle underlying the above constructions is parabolic scaling , a type of scaling optimally adapted to @xmath0 singularity curves .",
    "it is essential for the quasi - optimal approximation of @xmath0 cartoons and led to the notion of parabolic molecules  @xcite .",
    "this concept unifies various parabolically scaled systems under one roof , in particular the classic curvelet and shearlet systems , and is the predecessor of the more general framework of @xmath3-molecules  @xcite .      comparing the approximation properties of wavelets , curvelets , and ridgelets ,",
    "a distinct behavior with respect to their ability to resolve edges is characteristic .",
    "ridgelets are optimally adapted to straight edges , curvelets are optimal for @xmath0 line singularities , and wavelets for point singularities .",
    "this distinct behavior is due to the different scaling laws underlying their respective constructions : isotropic scaling for wavelets , parabolic scaling for curvelets , and directional scaling for ridgelets .    introducing a parameter @xmath31 and associated @xmath3-scaling matrices @xmath32 one",
    "can interpolate between these different types of scaling and construct corresponding @xmath3-scaled representation systems . incorporating @xmath3-scaling in the original construction of curvelets , for instance , yields so - called @xmath3-curvelets  @xcite . for @xmath33 $ ] ,",
    "they constitute a family of systems which encompass ridgelets ( in the sense of @xcite ) for @xmath6 , the classic curvelets for @xmath5 , and wavelets for @xmath4 . in a similar fashion , @xmath3-shearlet systems  @xcite",
    "can be obtained by modifying the classic shearlet constructions .",
    "a natural question concerning such @xmath3-scaled systems is how their approximation properties are affected by a change of the parameter @xmath3 . with regard to cartoon approximation",
    ", this question has been pursued in @xcite for @xmath3-curvelet frames and in @xcite for @xmath3-shearlet frames .",
    "it was shown that , if @xmath7 and if the cartoon @xmath22 is of regularity @xmath13 with @xmath34 , simple thresholding of the coefficients yields @xmath1-term approximations @xmath35 with a convergence of @xmath36 which apart from the log - factor is optimal .",
    "later , these results were further extended utilizing the theory of @xmath3-molecules  @xcite .",
    "this is a framework providing a unified approach to @xmath3-scaled systems , based solely on assumptions on the time - frequency localization of the respective functions .",
    "it allows to transfer approximation results obtained for one system of @xmath3-molecules to other systems , under certain consistency conditions .",
    "in particular , the rate   for @xmath3-curvelets was generalized ( in a weak form ) to other @xmath3-scaled representation systems  @xcite , which all achieve a rate of @xmath37 with @xmath38 arbitrarily small .    despite these results , many questions concerning @xmath3-scaled representation systems and their ability to approximate",
    "cartoon - like functions remain open , e.g. , their performance in the range @xmath39 or their suitability for the approximation of straight edges . in this research",
    "we want to address these open questions , shedding ( even ) more light on the role of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "our exposition starts with a short review of @xmath3-scaled systems in section  [ sec : curvelets ] , where also a specific construction of an @xmath3-curvelet frame for @xmath28 is presented .",
    "this frame , denoted by @xmath40 , will serve as a prototypical system whose properties have ramifications for other @xmath3-scaled systems , such as for example @xmath3-shearlets , due to the transference principle of the framework of @xmath3-molecules .    in the main part of the article , sections  [ sec : cartoon ] and [ sec : straight ]",
    ", we analyze the @xmath1-term approximation properties of the frame @xmath40 with regard to different classes of cartoon images . in section  [ sec : cartoon ] we start with cartoons with curved edges and first introduce corresponding signal classes of @xmath13 regularity for @xmath41 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : benchmark ] recalls @xmath16 as the order of the maximal achievable approximation rate for such @xmath13 cartoons , which can not be surpassed by any polynomial - depth restricted @xmath1-term approximation scheme , independent of the utilized dictionary .",
    "then we recall the quasi - optimal approximation   of @xmath3-curvelets , proved in  @xcite , if @xmath7 and @xmath34 .",
    "our main findings in section  3 , theorems  [ thm : bound1 ] and  [ thm : bound2 ] , extend and complement this result .",
    "theorem  [ thm : bound1 ] shows that the best possible @xmath1-term approximation rate achievable by @xmath40 for cartoons with curved edges is limited to at most @xmath42 , where @xmath10 and the smoothness of the cartoons is arbitrary .",
    "moreover , according to theorem  [ thm : bound2 ] , the achievable rate can not exceed @xmath43 if a simple thresholding scheme is used .",
    "these bounds show that @xmath3-curvelets with @xmath7 can not take advantage of regularity higher than @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , they prohibit optimal approximation of @xmath13 cartoons if @xmath17 , since decreasing @xmath3 beyond @xmath15 deteriorates the achievable rates compared to the classic curvelets .",
    "hence , with a rate of order @xmath2 , these provide the best performance among all @xmath3-curvelet systems , if the regularity of the cartoons is at least @xmath0 and curved singularities are involved . as a consequence ,",
    "no curvelet system can reach the optimality bound @xmath16 if @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , up to now , no frame construction is known where a nonadaptive approximation scheme can break this @xmath2 barrier and the quest for such frames remains open .    in section  [ sec : straight ] we consider cartoons featuring only straight edges . for the corresponding classes of regularity @xmath13 the same optimality benchmark @xmath16 holds true as for the cartoons with curved edges .",
    "our main result of section  [ sec : straight ] , theorem  [ thm : mainappr1 ] , shows that a simple thresholding scheme for the @xmath3-curvelet frame @xmath40 yields approximation rates of order @xmath20 .",
    "hence , here a smaller @xmath3 is beneficial and even ensures quasi - optimal approximation if @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "this finding generalizes earlier results for ridgelets .",
    "we finish with a short discussion of our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] . in particular",
    ", we point out some ramifications for other @xmath3-scaled representation systems , utilizing the framework of @xmath3-molecules .",
    "all @xmath3-scaled systems which are frames and in a certain sense consistent with @xmath40 feature similar properties , formulated in theorem  [ thm : mol_app ] and corollary  [ cor : mol_app ] .",
    "some useful properties of bessel functions needed in section  3 are collected in the appendix .",
    "before we begin , let us fix some general notation .",
    "writing @xmath45 we will refer to the natural numbers without zero , and we let @xmath46 . as usual , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "denote the integer , real and complex numbers .",
    "further , we put @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we also introduce the ` floor ' and ` ceiling ' of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the symbol @xmath55 is used for the torus obtained from the interval @xmath56 $ ] by identifying the endpoints . the unit - circle in @xmath57 is denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "the vector space @xmath59 , @xmath60 , is equipped with the euclidean scalar product @xmath61 and associated norm @xmath62 .",

    ", @xmath67 is a differential operator with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , the partial derivative in the @xmath70-th coordinate direction . given a vector @xmath71 , we further define @xmath72 ( with the convention @xmath73 ) .",
    "if @xmath74 holds true for two quantities @xmath75 depending on a set of parameters @xmath76 with a uniform constant @xmath77 , we write @xmath78 or equivalently @xmath79 .",
    "if both , @xmath78 and @xmath80 , hold true , we denote this by @xmath81 .    for measurable subsets",
    "@xmath82 we let @xmath83 , @xmath64 $ ] , denote the usual lebesgue spaces with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "the corresponding ( quasi-)norms are denoted by @xmath84 , in case @xmath85 we abbreviate @xmath86 .",
    "for the scalar product on @xmath27 the same notation @xmath61 as for the euclidean product on @xmath59 is used .",
    "the lebesgue sequence spaces , for a discrete index set @xmath87 , are denoted by @xmath88 with associated ( quasi-)norms @xmath89 .",
    "the definition of their weak counterparts @xmath90 , equipped with ( quasi-)norms @xmath91 , are recalled in section  [ sec : straight ] .",
    "the space @xmath92 , for an integer @xmath93 , shall comprise all continuous real - valued functions on @xmath59 , whose classic derivatives up to order @xmath94 exist .",
    "for @xmath41 we then define @xmath95 where @xmath96 and the hlder constant of exponent @xmath33 $ ] is given by @xmath97 the notation @xmath98 , for some open subset @xmath82 , is used for functions @xmath99 whose support @xmath100 is compact and contained in the closure @xmath101 of @xmath102 .",

    "@xmath108 is extended to the tempered distributions @xmath109 , and we often write @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "directional multi - scale systems based on @xmath3-scaling feature a characteristic tiling of the frequency domain .",
    "the multi - scale structure is reflected by a partition of the fourier plane into dyadic coronae , further divided into wedge - like tiles , where the energy of the system elements is concentrated . in case of inhomogeneous systems ,",
    "a ball around the origin corresponds to the low - frequency base scale .",
    "a prototypical instance of such an @xmath3-scaled system is the frame @xmath40 of @xmath3-curvelets , thoroughly defined in this section .",
    "it is prototypical in the sense that many of its properties transfer  via the framework of @xmath3-molecules  @xcite  to other @xmath3-scaled systems . among these",
    "are other @xmath3-curvelet constructions  @xcite , but also band - limited  @xcite as well as compactly supported  @xcite @xmath3-shearlet systems .",
    "this fact gives the system @xmath40 a special significance for our purpose and motivates its detailed discussion here .    before defining @xmath40 , which is similar to the construction of @xmath3-curvelets in @xcite ,",
    "let us first elaborate the geometric aspects of the corresponding frequency tiling . at scales",
    "@xmath112 we have the coronae @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a fixed parameter and @xmath77 is a constant , specified conveniently later .",
    "these coronae are each uniformly divided into an even number of wedges , whose angular width at scale @xmath115 is given by the angle @xmath116 and depends on another parameter @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "the approximate size of the resulting wedges correlates with an @xmath3-scaled rectangle of dimension @xmath118 . by combining opposite wedges to wedge pairs ,",
    "we obtain the tiles for the scales @xmath112 .",
    "there is only one tile associated with the base scale @xmath119 , the low frequency ball @xmath120 .    for convenience ,",
    "let us also introduce the angle @xmath121 . according to the above construction , at each scale",
    "@xmath122 the number of tiles @xmath123 is given by @xmath124 in the following , the individual tiles will be denoted by @xmath125 and indexed by the set @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "hereby we let @xmath129 , and in each corona @xmath130 with @xmath112 the wedge - pair @xmath131 shall be aligned horizontally , i.e. , @xmath132 the remaining tiles @xmath125 , @xmath133 , are obtained via rotations of @xmath131 by integer multiples @xmath134 of the angle @xmath135 defined in  .",
    "hence , @xmath136 with rotation matrix @xmath137 the resulting tiling of the fourier domain is schematically depicted in figure  [ fig : freq_domain ] ( a ) .",

    "this range is natural for the considered inhomogeneous systems . if @xmath138 , the number of tiles @xmath123 in each corona decreases with rising scale , and eventually @xmath139 .",

    "let us now turn to the actual construction of the @xmath3-curvelet frame @xmath40 .",
