    "given an elliptic curve @xmath5 over a field @xmath6 , the determination of its mordell - weil group is a fundamental question in algebraic geometry and number theory . when @xmath7 is a rational function field in one variable , this question becomes a geometrical question of understanding sections of an elliptic surface with section .",
    "lattice theoretic methods to attack this problem were described in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath8 is a rational elliptic surface given as a minimal proper model of @xmath9 with @xmath10 $ ] of degree at most @xmath11 , the possible configurations ( types ) of bad fibers and mordell - weil groups were analyzed by oguiso and shioda @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the second author studied sections for some families of elliptic surfaces with an additive fiber , by means of the specialization map , and obtained a relation between the coefficients of the weierstrass equation and the fundamental invariants of the corresponding weyl groups .",
    "this was expanded in @xcite , which studied families with a bad fiber of additive reduction more exhaustively .",
    "the formal notion of an excellent family was defined ( see the next section ) , and the authors found excellent families for many of the `` admissible '' types .    the analysis of rational elliptic surfaces of high mordell - weil rank , but with a fiber of multiplicative reduction , is much more challenging . however , understanding this situation is arguably more fundamental , since if we write down a `` random '' elliptic surface , then with probability close to @xmath12 it will have mordell - weil lattice @xmath1 and twelve nodal fibers ( i.e. of multiplicative reduction ) . to be more precise ,",
    "if we choose weierstrass coefficients @xmath13 of degree @xmath11 , with coefficients chosen uniformly at random from among rational numbers ( say ) of height at most @xmath14 , then as @xmath15 the surface will satisfy the above condition with probability approaching @xmath12 .",
    "one can make a similar statement for rational elliptic surfaces chosen to have mordell - weil lattice @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc .    in a recent work @xcite , this study was carried out for elliptic surfaces with a fiber of type @xmath18 and mordell - weil lattice isometric to @xmath17 , through a `` multiplicative excellent family '' of type @xmath19 .",
    "we will describe this case briefly in section [ e6recap ] .",
    "the main result of this paper shows that two explicitly described families of rational elliptic surfaces with mordell - weil lattices @xmath16 or @xmath1 are multiplicative excellent .",
    "the proof involves a surprising connection with representation theory of the corresponding lie groups , and in particular , their fundamental characters . in particular",
    ", we deduce that the weierstrass coefficients give another natural set of generators for the multiplicative invariants of the respective weyl groups , as a polynomial ring .",
    "we note that similar formulas were derived by eguchi and sakai @xcite using calculations from string theory and mirror symmetry .",
    "the idea of an excellent family is quite useful and important in number theory .",
    "an excellent family of algebraic varieties leads to a galois extension @xmath20 of two purely transcendental extensions of a number field @xmath21 ( say @xmath2 ) , with galois group a desired finite group @xmath22 .",
    "this setup has an immediate number theoretic application , since one may specialize the parameters @xmath23 and apply hilbert s irreducibility theorem to obtain galois extensions over @xmath2 with the same galois group .",
    "furthermore , we can make the construction effective if appropriate properties of the group @xmath22 are known ( see examples [ bigexamplee7 ] and [ bigexamplee8 ] for the case @xmath24 or @xmath4 ) . at the same time , an excellent family will give rise to a split situation very easily , by specializing the parameters @xmath25 instead . for examples , in the situation considered in our paper",
    ", we obtain elliptic curves over @xmath26 with mordell - weil rank @xmath27 or @xmath28 together with explicit generators for the mordell - weil group ( see examples [ splitexamplee7 ] and [ splitexamplee8 ] )",
    ". there are also applications to geometric specialization or degeneration of the family .",
    "therefore , it is desirable ( but quite nontrivial ) to construct explicit excellent families of algebraic varieties .",
    "such a situation is quite rare in general : theoretically , any finite reflection group is a candidate , but it is not generally neatly related to an algebraic geometric family .",
    "hilbert treated the case of the symmetric group @xmath29 , corresponding to families of zero - dimensional varieties .",
    "not many examples were known before the ( additive ) excellent families for the weyl groups of the exceptional lie groups @xmath19 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 were given in @xcite , using the theory of mordell - weil lattices .",
    "here , we finish the story for the multiplicative excellent families for these weyl groups .",
    "let @xmath30 be an elliptic surface with section @xmath31 , i.e. a proper relatively minimal model of its generic fiber , which is an elliptic curve .",
    "we denote the image of @xmath32 by @xmath33 , which we take to be the zero section of the nron model .",

    "we first write down the relation between the coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath422 , and the fundamental invariants @xmath317 ; as before , we postpone the proofs to the auxiliary files and outline the idea in section [ identities ] .",
    "second , we write down the coefficients @xmath100 in terms of @xmath346 ; see section [ resultants ] for an explanation of how this is carried out . in the interest of brevity , we do not write out either of these sets of equations , but relegate them to the auxiliary computer files",
    ". finally , setting the corresponding expressions equal to each other , we obtain a set of equations @xmath321 through @xmath423 .    to solve these equations , proceed as follows : first use @xmath321 through @xmath324 to solve for @xmath424 in terms of @xmath317 and @xmath425 .",

    "we solve for all the other variables , obtaining the system above and completing the proof of theorem [ explicite8 ] .",
    "the deduction of theorem [ excellente8 ] now proceeds exactly as in the case of @xmath0 .    as in the @xmath0 case , once we find the explicit relation between the weierstrass coefficients and the fundamental characters , we may go back and explore the `` genericity condition '' for this family to have mordell - weil lattice isomorphic to @xmath1 . to do this",
    "we compute the discriminant of the cubic in @xmath87 , after completing the square in @xmath88 , and take the discriminant with respect to @xmath89 of the resulting polynomial of degree @xmath430 .",
    "a computation shows that this discriminant factors as the cube of a polynomial @xmath339 ( which vanishes exactly when the family has a fiber of additive reduction , generically type @xmath268 ) , and the product of @xmath341 , where @xmath342 runs over minimal vectors of @xmath1 .",
    "again , the genericity condition to have mordell - weil lattice exactly @xmath1 is just the nonvanishing of @xmath431 the expression which occurs in the weyl denominator formula .",
    "furthermore , the condition to have only multiplicative fibers is that @xmath432 .",
    "as before , the proof of theorem [ e8degen ] follows immediately from the results of @xcite , by degeneration from a flat family .",
    "we now explain a computational aid , used in obtaining the equations expressing the coefficients of @xmath229 ( for @xmath1 ) or @xmath315 ( for @xmath0 ) in terms of the weierstrass coefficients of the associated family of rational elliptic surfaces .",
    "we illustrate this using the system of equations obtained for sections of the @xmath1 family : @xmath433 setting @xmath353 and solving the first equation for @xmath434 we have @xmath435 .",
    "we solve the next three equations for @xmath436 respectively .",
    "this leaves us with three equations @xmath437 .",
    "these have degrees @xmath438 respectively in @xmath195 .",
    "taking the appropriate linear combination of @xmath439 and @xmath440 gives us an equation @xmath441 which is linear in @xmath195 .",
    "similarly , we may use @xmath439 and @xmath442 to obtain another equation @xmath443 , linear in @xmath195 .",
    "we write @xmath444 the resultant of the first two polynomials gives us an equation @xmath445 while the resultant of the first and third gives us @xmath446    finally , we substitute @xmath447 throughout , obtaining two equations @xmath448 and @xmath449 .    next , we would like to compute the resultant of @xmath450 and @xmath451 , which have degrees @xmath28 and @xmath416 with respect to @xmath194 , to obtain a single equation satisfied by @xmath356 .",
    "however , the polynomials @xmath452 and @xmath453 are already fairly large ( they take a few hundred kilobytes of memory ) , and since their degree in @xmath194 is not too small , it is beyond the current reach of computer algebra systems such as ` gp / pari ` or ` magma ` to compute their resultant .",
    "it would take too long to compute their resultant , and another issue is that the resultant would take too much memory to store , certainly more than is available on the authors computer systems ( for instance , it would take more than 16 gb of memory ) .    to circumvent this issue , what we shall do is to use several specializations of @xmath23 in @xmath454 .",
    "once we specialize , the polynomials take much less space to store , and the computations of the resultants becomes tremendously easier .",
    "since the resultant can be computed via the sylvester determinant @xmath455 where @xmath456 and @xmath457 , we see that the resultant is a polynomial @xmath458 with coefficients @xmath459 being polynomials in the coefficients of the @xmath460 and the @xmath461 , which happen to be elements of @xmath219 $ ] ( recall that @xmath462 ) .",
    "furthermore , we can bound the degrees @xmath463 of @xmath464 with respect to the @xmath465th coordinate of @xmath23 , by using explicit bounds on the multidegrees of the @xmath460 and @xmath466 . therefore , by using lagrange interpolation ( with respect to the eight variables @xmath467 ) we can reconstruct @xmath464 from its specializations for various values of @xmath23 .",
    "the same method lets us show that @xmath468 is divisible by @xmath469 ( for instance , by showing that @xmath470 through @xmath471 are zero ) , and also by @xmath472 ( by first shifting @xmath356 by @xmath12 and then computing the sylvester determinant , and proceeding as before ) , as well as by @xmath473 ( this time , using cube roots of unity ) .",
    "finally , it is clear that @xmath468 is divisible by the square of the resultant @xmath474 of @xmath475 and @xmath476 with respect to @xmath194 . removing these extraneous factors",
    ", we get a polynomial @xmath477 which is monic and reciprocal of degree @xmath349 .",
    "we compute its top few coefficients by this interpolation method .",
    "finally , we note the interpolation method above in fact is completely rigorous .",
    "namely , let @xmath478 be the coefficient of @xmath479 in @xmath477 , with bounds @xmath480 for its multidegree , and @xmath481 is the putative polynomial we have computed using lagrange interpolation on a set @xmath482 , where @xmath483 for @xmath484 are sets of integers chosen generically enough to ensure that @xmath474 has the correct degree and that @xmath468 is not divisible by any higher powers of @xmath356 , @xmath485 or @xmath486 than in the generic case .",
    "then since @xmath487 for all choices of @xmath488 , we see that the difference of these polynomials must vanish .",
    "finally , we demonstrate how to deduce the identities relating the coefficients of @xmath489 or @xmath490 to the fundamental characters for @xmath0 ( and similarly , the coefficients of @xmath491 to the fundamental characters of @xmath1 ) .",
    "conceptually , the simplest way to do this is to express the alternating powers of the @xmath192-dimensional representation @xmath492 or the @xmath493-dimensional representation @xmath494 in terms of the fundamental modules of @xmath0 and their tensor products .",
    "we know that the character @xmath495 of @xmath494 is @xmath496 , where the sum is over the @xmath249 roots of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath497 . for the next example , we consider @xmath498 .",
    "this gives rise to the equation @xmath499 which gives the relation @xmath500 .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out to obtain all the other identities used in our proofs , using the software ` lie ` , available from ` http://www-math.univ-poitiers.fr/~maavl/lie/ ` .",
    "a more explicit method is to compute the expressions for the @xmath228 as laurent polynomials in @xmath117 ( note that @xmath501 ) , and then do the same for the @xmath100 or @xmath314 .",
    "the latter calculation is simplified by computing the power sums @xmath502 ( for @xmath342 running over the smallest vectors of @xmath16 or @xmath0 ) , for @xmath503 and then using newton s formulas to convert to the elementary symmetric polynomials , which are @xmath301 or @xmath504 .",
    "finally , we check the identities by direct computation in the laurent polynomial ring ( it may be helpful to clear out denominators ) .",
    "this method has the advantage that we obtain explicit expressions for the @xmath228 ( and then for @xmath23 by theorem [ explicite7 ] ) in terms of @xmath505 , which may then be used to generate examples such as example [ splitexamplee7 ] .",
