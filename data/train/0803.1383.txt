    "type ia supernovae ( sneia ) , the thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs that approach the chandrasekhar mass limit ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are characterised by a simple optical light curve , showing a rise to maximum followed by a decline .",
    "the light curve is governed by the deposition of the @xmath3-rays and the positrons produced by the decay of @xmath0ni , which is copiously produced in the explosion and decays into @xmath0co  and hence @xmath0fe  @xcite , and by the diffusion in the expanding ejecta of the optical photons that are produced in the thermalisation process .",
    "a correlation between the peak luminosity of sneia and the shape of the light curve @xcite , makes this class of sne good standardizable candles .",
    "sneia have been used to explore the expansion properties of the universe out to about one third of its present age @xcite .",
    "while the sn luminosity is related fairly directly to the amount of @xmath0niejected @xcite , so that the observed spread in peak luminosity suggests a corresponding spread in @xmath0ni  mass of about one order of magnitude ( @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) @xcite , the light curve width depends primarily on the optical opacity in the ejecta , which is a function of both temperature and composition @xcite . in the h - free ejecta of sneia , line opacity dominates over continuum processes @xcite .",
    "heavier elements have a thicker array of lines which , in combination with the rapid and differential expansion of the sn ejecta , causes the effective frequencies of the lines to overlap over the volume of the ejecta , efficiently blocking most uv and blue photons . for most of these photons",
    "the only way to escape is to be re - emitted in some less saturated transition in the red .",
    "this `` fluorescence '' process determines the shape of type i sn spectra at early times , when the density is sufficiently large .",
    "@xcite showed that if the opacity is parametrised according to the average number of line transitions of the species that dominate the ejecta ( singly and doubly ionised si , s , fe , co and ni for sneia ) , sneia that produce more @xmath0ni  are not only brighter but also have a larger opacity and hence broader light curves .",
    "additionally , different conditions within the white dwarf ( e.g.  metallicity ) can lead to different nucleosynthesis of fe - group isotopes @xcite .",
    "for the same production of nse material , sne with a higher fraction of stable isotopes ( e.g.  @xmath6fe , @xmath7ni ) over radioactive @xmath0ni  have light curves with a similar shape but different brightness .",
    "this may cause a spread in the observed luminosity - light curve shape relation .",
    "although an explanation for the observed behaviour of sneia seems to have been found , a conclusive proof of the nature of the physical mechanism behind these explosions still eludes us .",
    "subsonic deflagrations of chandrasekhar - mass carbon - oxygen white dwarfs seem to be unable to produce the required energy and @xmath0ni  yield @xcite .",
    "detonations incinerate the white dwarf to nse , and do not produce the ime that are observed in the spectra .",
    "a transition from a deflagration to a detonation @xcite is a possible solution @xcite , but its physical basis remains to be established , despite much effort @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the study of sneia , rather than computing explosions and predicting their appearance , is to map the outcome of real events .",
    "this can be done performing spectrum synthesis of a time - series of sn spectra , following the progressive exposure of deeper and deeper layers of the ejecta as they expand .",
    "spectra at early times , in the so - called photospheric phase , probe only the outer half or so of the depth of the ejecta .",
    "a super - nebular phase then follows , during which the position of the pseudo - photosphere is extremely wavelength dependent and some features already follow nebular physics .",
    "a more direct and complete view of the inner ejecta can be obtained about one year after the explosion , when the gas in the young sn remnant is heated by collisions with the fast particles from the deposition of @xmath3-rays and positrons and cools by emission of radiation , mostly in forbidden [ fe  ii ] and [ fe  iii ] lines . in this phase",
    ", the dominance of fe lines testifies that @xmath0niis synthesised mostly in the deepest parts of the star , in line with theoretical expectations ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "a relation between the width of the fe emission lines - which indicates the velocity of expansion of the bulk of @xmath0ni  - and both the sn peak brightness and the light curve decline rate @xcite confirms that in more luminous sne a larger fraction of the star is burned to nse .",
    "it is therefore essential that sne that have been monitored in the peak phase are also observed spectroscopically and photometrically in the nebular phase",
    ".    only few examples of sneia with very detailed time coverage were available ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) before the european research and training network on the physics of type ia supernovae ( rtn ) began collecting data of nearby sneia systematically ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "now , the availability of a sizable sample of sneia with detailed observational coverage makes it possible to study in greater depth the properties of sne of different luminosities . since",
    "such differences are the result of different nucleosynthetic outcomes of the explosions , deriving the composition of the ejecta from the data should shed light on the details of the explosion process and it variations .    after initial efforts using homogeneous compositions ( e.g.   *",
    "* ) , the more computationally expensive analysis of a time series of spectra using stratified abundances has been attempted in only one case so far .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) mapped the ejecta of the normally luminous sn2002bo from the centre out to @xmath8 .",
    "they showed that abundances are stratified but some mixing does occur .",
    "they detected burning products , namely stable fe , si and ca , at very high velocities .",
    "this material gives rise to high velocity features ( hvf ) , an apparently ubiquitous property of sneia at the earliest phases @xcite .",
    "for sn2002bo , the ime region extends down to @xmath9 , below which nse material dominates .",
    "this distribution of elements in sn2002bo seemed to favour a delayed detonation scenario .",
    "when the abundances derived in this sort of tomographic scan of the ejecta were used to generate opacities in a @xmath10erg , chandrasekhar - mass explosion with the density structure of the classic w7 model @xcite , the observed bolometric light curve was reproduced extremely well , including the early rise .",
    "this is induced by mixing out of @xmath0ni , which is not predicted by most current explosion models but is indeed detected in early snia spectra @xcite .    in this series of papers",
    "our aim is to describe the composition of the ejecta of sneia with different luminosities and light curve decline rates .",
    "sn2002bo was a snia of average luminosity , which synthesised @xmath11 of @xmath0ni . in this second paper of the series",
    ", we address a sn at the dim end of the distribution of spectroscopically normal sneia .",
    "sn2004eo was observed by the rtn @xcite .",
    "it was a relatively underluminous event , with a @xmath12-band post - maximum decline rate @xmath13@xmath14mag , which makes it very similar to the template sn1992a .",
    "like many such events , sn2004eo showed a slow evolution of the si  ii  line velocity @xcite , measurements of which indicate that si extended down to layers at @xmath15 , which is deeper than in sn2002bo .",
    "the earliest spectra show a mild hvf in the ca  ii  ir triplet , and possibly in si  ii  6355 .",
    "the spectra and the light curve of sn2004eo were presented by @xcite . the sample ,",
    "although temporally not as dense as for sn2002bo , covers both the peak and the nebular phases , and is probably the best so far for a snia of this luminosity group , offering a complete view of the ejecta of sn2004eo except perhaps for the highest velocities .    in section 2",
    "our modelling is presented , and its limitations assessed . in section 3",
    "the modelling of the photospheric - epoch spectra is described , while the modelling of the nebular spectrum is discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "the abundance stratification obtained from the models is presented and discussed . in section 6 we present and discuss a theoretical light curve computed on the basis of the abundances that have been derived .",
    "finally , in section 7 we give our conclusions .",
    "our modelling strategy of is to follow the evolution of the sn in the early phases with a photosphere - plus - expanding - envelope code based on the sobolev approximation , and to explore the innermost part of the ejecta modelling a single nebular spectrum taken @xmath16 yr later with a non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) nebular code .    for the early - time spectra",
    ", we used a montecarlo code based on that first described by and updated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the code assumes a sharp photosphere , where the luminosity is emitted , and adopts the sobolev approximation to follow energy packets in their propagation through the sn ejecta , which are represented by a density - velocity structure .",
    "the emerging luminosity @xmath17 , the velocity of the pseudo - photosphere @xmath18 , and an epoch @xmath19 since the explosion are required input , as is a set of depth - dependent abundances .",
    "energy packets representing photon batches can interact with the ejecta via either line absorption or electron scattering . upon absorption",
    ", a packet can be reprocessed into a different line , thus describing the process of line blocking which is essential for spectrum formation in type i sne @xcite .",
    "no continuum processes are assumed to occur above the pseudo - photosphere .",
    "the properties of the radiation field and of the gas are iterated to convergence , temperature structure is established in radiative equilibrium and the ionization and excitation structures are computed using a modified nebular approximation that describes deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we use the code version that employs abundance stratification , as discussed in paper i.    the nebular spectrum has been modelled using a code that follows in 1d the propagation and the deposition of the @xmath3-rays and positrons produced in the decay of @xmath0ni  into @xmath0co  and hence @xmath0fe  using a montecarlo scheme @xcite .",
    "gas heating by the fast particles created upon @xmath3-ray and positron deposition and the consequent cooling via line emission are described in non - lte @xcite .",
    "stratification in density and abundance is used , as in @xcite .    before we describe our results in detail",
    ", it is necessary to discuss the possible limitations of this method .",
    "extracting the element distribution from a series of sn spectra is an ill - posed inverse problem : too many of the parameters that are used to compute the synthetic spectra are not known . in particular , assuming a certain density distribution artificially narrows down the number of possible solutions .",
    "here we adopt the density - velocity distribution of w7 @xcite , for both the early and late - time modelling . although w7 describes a more luminous snia than sn2004eo , it represents a typical density structure .",
    "possible uncertainties related to using that particular model are discussed in section 7 . on the other hand ,",
    "using any other explosion model is no better method , as the uncertainties related to the particular model would simply compound with those related to the spectrum synthesis codes .",
    "additional caveats stem from the design of the code that we use to model the photospheric - phase spectra .",
    "the use of a sharp photosphere is very effective , and it keeps the analysis free from the details of the explosion model , but it does not correspond to reality , in particular at times after maximum , when the photosphere resides within the @xmath0ni  zone and consequently a significant fraction of the @xmath3-ray deposition occurs above the photosphere",
    ". these photons may alter both the flux level and the line profiles .",
    "fortunately , this is mitigated by the decreasing density , which guarantees that even at advanced stages most deposition still occurs below the photosphere .",
    "additionally , since the nebular spectra do not suffer from this problem , and since the velocities sampled by the nebular lines exceed 7000 , combining early photospheric - epoch results for the outer ejecta and late nebular ones for the inner ejecta we effectively avoid being too affected by the lesser accuracy of the post - maximum models .    another shortcoming is the fact that we use a one - dimensional approach , while in reality sneia ejecta may be affected to some extent by aspherical effects .",
    "however , three - dimensional spectral modelling can only be attempted starting from an explosion model , or the number of free parameters would be impossibly large , and it is a path that runs contrary to our approach .    when modelling spectra , it is practically impossible to establish objective criteria with which to judge the goodness of a fit .",
    "in fact , it is not fair simply to measure the deviation from the observed flux , because not all wavelengths have the same weight when it comes to deciding whether the physical quantitites that determine the spectrum are properly described .",
    "deviations in wavelength are if possible of greater importance , because they signal an incorrect abundance , ionization or density distribution .",
    "deviations in flux can be due to an incorrect luminosity or temperature , but also to incorrect line strengths , and these are again determined by density , ionization , and abundances .",
    "therefore , a human observer is probably the best judge of the goodness of a fit .    in the case of a tomography experiment ,",
    "it is not enough to fit a single spectrum , but the entire series must be reproduced by a single set of input data",
    ". there may be solutions that fit a single spectrum better than the one finally adopted , but the overall result may not be as good as that obtained with a different set .",
    "therefore , a double compromise must be reached , on a set of input parameters that give both acceptable individual fits and on a fair reproduction of the spectral evolution .",
    "further details about the accuracy of our results are given in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "we have modelled 8 early - time spectra of sn2004eo , covering epochs from @xmath20 to @xmath21 days relative to @xmath12 maximum .",
    "there are later spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we did not model them because the montecarlo code becomes progressively less accurate at advanced epochs and because they probe very low velocities that are covered by the nebular spectrum .",
    "we adopted a bolometric rise time of 19 days for sn2004eo .",
    "this is somewhat less than the average @xmath12-band rise time @xcite , as motivated by the fact that dimmer sneia seem to rise somewhat more rapidly than brighter ones .",
    "this is the consequence of the smaller opacity and the shorter photon diffusion time in the less nuclearly processed ejecta of dimmer sne @xcite .",
    "the main input values for the synthetic spectra are recapped in table 1 , and the synthetic spectra are shown and compared to the observed ones in figures 1 and 2 . using this approach , we map the abundance distribution in the ejecta .",
    "first we briefly discuss each spectrum in turn .",

    "other strong features are due to ca  ii , si  ii , s  ii , o  i. the ratio of the two si  ii  lines ( @xmath26 and 6355 ) , which is a good temperature indicator @xcite is rather large . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "this is not directly the effect of a low temperature , as then the ratio would show the opposite trend , nor is it caused by ti  ii  lines , as claimed by @xcite , as in that case the much stronger ti  ii  lines in the blue would completely change the spectrum .",
    "it is the result of saturation of the 6355  line as si  iibecomes more abundant with respect to si  iii  going to lower luminosities , hence lower temperatures .",
    "so this is only indirectly the effect of temperature . in the uv",
    ", the spectrum is blocked by fe  ii , fe  iii , ni  ii , ti  ii , ti  iii , cr  ii , cr  ii  and mg  ii  lines .",
    "the flux redistribution caused by line blocking determines the properties of the optical spectrum .",
    "the second spectrum has an epoch of 12.7 days after explosion ( figure 1b ) .",
    "the increase in luminosity does not keep up with the increase in size , and the temperature is slightly lower .",
    "most lines and their strength ratios are however similar to the previous epoch , since the temperature drop is small .",
    "the most noticeable change is the increased strength of the s  ii  complex near 5500  ( @xmath28  for the bluer feature , @xmath29  for the redder one ) .",
    "this is indicative both of recombination and of an increased sulphur abundance as deeper layers are exposed .",
    "the abundance of silicon is also higher near the photosphere , but this has less of an effect on the si  ii  lines , which were already quite strong in the earlier spectrum . in both this and the previous spectrum",
    ", the strength of the o  i7774  line indicates that a significant fraction of the outer layers was left unburned or only partially burned , as indicated by the absence of carbon lines @xcite .      in the third spectrum , the last before @xmath12 maximum with an epoch of 16.4 days after explosion , the trend towards lower temperatures continues , while again the most apparent evolution is in the strength of the s  ii  lines ( figure 1c ) .",
    "the ime abundances are not much higher at this depth ( 9500 ) , and reach a maximum here .",
    "the features that characterise the spectrum are the same as at the previous epoch . in all the pre - maximum spectra",
    "the near - ir continuum is reproduced reasonably well by the model , which never overestimates the flux by more than 20% .",
    "this indicates that the opacity , which is mostly due to lines , is sufficiently large at optical wavelengths that the assumption of an underlying black body is not grossly incorrect .",
    "line blocking in the uv is stronger in this spectrum , as the photosphere moves inwards and more metals can absorb uv photons .",
    "the spectra soon after maximum show subtle but significant differences with respect to the pre - maximum ones .",
    "in particular , starting with the spectrum of 2 october 2004 , which has an an epoch of 21.4 days after explosion ( figure 1d ) , fe  ii   dominates over fe  iii .",
    "this is clearly seen in the shape of the feature near 4800 , which now shows strong fe  ii  multiplet 48 lines ( 4923 , 5018 , 5169 ) and has the characteristic shape of spectroscopically normal but relatively dim sneia . also , the o  i  7774  line became weaker , indicating that the oxygen content near this rather deep ( 9000 ) photosphere is small or zero .",
    "the ionization of other ions that determine the uv also changes , as it does for iron , so that now ca  ii , ti  ii  and cr  ii , together with fe  ii , determine the uv opacity .",
    "on the other hand , this spectrum still has a rather blue optical pseudo - continuum .",
    "the model reproduces the observed spectrum at least bluewards of @xmath32 , with a near - photospheric composition that is still dominated by ime , but where @xmath0ni  is increasing .",
    "the mass enclosed below the photosphere is now @xmath33 , and we are beginning to see the bulk of the nse material .",
    "the model now overestimates the continuum in the red , indicating that the assumption of an underlying black body is less appropriate at this epoch .",
    "the observed pseudo - continuum redwards of the si  ii6355  line must be caused mostly by flux redistribution to the red from line processes that take place in the blue and uv .",
    "thus , the luminosity used for the model is probably higher than the real value . nevertheless , the strength of the synthetic o  i7774  line is comparable to that of the observed feature .",
    "this is important in order to estimate the oxygen abundance . in general",
    "the abundances are not very different from those of the last pre - maximum spectrum .",
    "the next spectrum ( figure 2a ) has an epoch of 26.4 days after explosion , and it continues to show the evolution towards lower temperatures ( a larger ratio of the two si  ii  lines , the growth of the si  ii - fe  ii  feature near 4800 ) that started from the earliest phases .",
    "the iron absorption is now much stronger , indicating that we are beginning to see the inner , fully burned zone . placing the boundary of the transition between incomplete ( ime - dominated ) and complete ( nse - dominated ) burning zones somewhere",
    "between 7000 and 9000one derives , using w7 , an upper limit to the nse mass of @xmath35 .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite .      in this spectrum ( figure 2b ) , at an epoch of 30.4 days after explosion , the low temperature begins to affect the pseudo - continuum significantly : the shape of the spectrum is now much redder .",
    "fe  ii  lines have grown in strength . not only is the ni abundance higher , but @xmath0co  is decaying to @xmath0fe .",
    "the fraction of stable fe is also larger .",
    "this is a feature of sn2004eo which is also borne out by the analysis of the nebular spectra ( see sect .",
    "3 ) . at this and later epochs ,",
    "the feature near 5900  is probably contaminated by na  i d .",
    "this spectrum ( figure 2c ) has a nominal epoch of 33.4 days after explosion , and is very similar to the one obtained three days earlier .",
    "most features are the same as in the previous epoch .",
    "the na  i d line is growing in strength , as is typical especially of dim sneia .",
    "this feature is not reproduced because of the well - known uncertainty in the sodium ionization ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "although the photosphere is now very deep ( 4700 ) , the ca  ii  ir triplet absorption seems to reach even lower velocities , possibly suggesting the need for a higher calcium abundance at low velocity , or an incorrect estimate of the ionization there .",
    "the composition is dominated by @xmath0ni  ( 60% by mass ) and stable fe ( 35% by mass ) , the rest being mostly silicon and sulphur .",
    "this agrees with the nebular spectrum , which samples the region of the ejecta that is near the photosphere at this epoch .",
    "the last of the early - time spectra we modelled has an epoch of 40.4 days after explosion ( figure 2d ) .",
    "it is very red , and it shows deep and broad absorptions .",
    "the strong emissions are still p - cygni components caused by the absorption blends : the epoch is still too early for nebular emission lines to emerge , as indicated by the good fit to the ca  ii  ir emission component .",
    "the broad features near 4500 and 5000  are caused by fe  ii  lines , although some ti  ii  contributes to the bluer feature , as it does in very underluminous sne @xcite .",
    "the na  i d line is becoming very strong , while other lines are the same as at earlier epochs .",
    "the synthetic spectrum matches the observed one surprisingly well , considering the advanced epoch and the very deep photosphere ( 2800 ) , which suggests that the assumption of a grey photosphere is not unreasonable at this epoch .",
    "the reason for this is probably the fact that since iron dominates the composition near the photosphere , fe  ii , ti  ii , and , further to the red , co  iilines effectively block the radiation and form a pseudo - continuum throughout the optical domain .",
    "the composition obtained agrees with that derived from the late - time spectrum ( sect .",
    "one nebular - epoch spectrum of sn2004eo was presented in @xcite .",
    "it was obtained 227 days after @xmath12 maximum , on 16 may 2006 .",
    "we use this spectrum to investigate the structure and composition of the inner ejecta .",
    "the modelling results were already included in the compilation of @xcite , but the spectrum has been recalibrated because of scatter in the photometry and the values are therefore slightly different .    a one - zone version of the nebular code can be used to determine basic parameters as in @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic width of the emission lines required to match the broad blends is 7300 , which is on the low side of the distribution of line widths in sneia @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there is good overlap in velocity space between the most advanced photospheric epoch spectra that we modelled and the nebular spectrum , ensuring complete coverage of the ejecta and the consistency of the analysis .",
    "material at velocities above 8000makes a negligible contribution to the nebular spectrum , indicating that the densities are too low and that @xmath0ni  is not present in any large amount at those velocities .        for the stratified modelling the density stratification of w7",
    "is again adopted , and the depth - dependent abundances are modified in order to fit the spectrum .",
    "the abundances in the nebula are dominated by nse material .",
    "the best fit ( figure 3 ) includes a @xmath0ni  mass of @xmath39 , located mostly between velocities of 2000 and 8000 .",
    "the abundance of @xmath0ni  reaches @xmath40 by mass between 3000 and 7000 .",
    "the innermost zone is dominated by stable fe and ni .",
    "this is necessary in order to avoid the formation of sharp emission peaks for the strongest [ fe  iii ] and [ fe  ii ] lines and to achieve an ionization balance that gives the correct ratio of the [ fe  iii]-dominated 4700  line and the [ fe  ii]-dominated 5200  line .",
    "the mass of stable fe is @xmath41 , so that the total nse mass is @xmath42 ( the mass of stable ni is very small , in order to avoid a strong [ ni  ii ] emission near 7000 .",
    "the strongest observed emissions are fitted quite accurately",
    ". many of the weaker lines that are not reproduced are weak fe or co lines , for which the collision strengths are not well known .",
    "the poor reproduction of those features means that we may be underestimating the @xmath0ni  mass by @xmath43% .",
    "apart from the strong [ fe  ii ] and [ fe  iii ] lines , na  i d is clearly visible , as are ca  ii  lines , which are however strongly affected by [ fe  ii ] emission .",
    "mg  i ] 4700  contributes to the blue wing of the 4700  feature : a mg mass of @xmath44 is obtained from the fit .",
    "silicon does not have strong lines in the optical domain , but it has a cooling effect since it produces lines in the ir , notably at 1.6 microns .",
    "a low upper limit for the sulphur abundance can be established from the line near 4000 .",
    "the oxygen abundance must be very low at velocities below 8000 , or a strong [ o  i ] 6300  line would form .",
    "the carbon abundance must also be very low , or [ c  i ] emission would affect the blue part of the ca  ii  ir triplet emission .",
    "the abundances above 8000are the same as those derived from the early - time modelling . between 2800 and 7000some difference exists , but",
    "this is never more than 10% .",
    "connecting the results of early and late - time spectral modelling , we can reconstruct the abundance distribution as a function of depth in the ejecta .",
    "the results are shown in figures 4a and 4b .",
    "the 11 most abundant species which contribute to the spectra are displayed .",
    "minor species can not be treated accurately owing to the lack of significant spectral features .",
    "figures 4a and 4b show that oxygen dominates the outer ejecta , down to @xmath45 .",
    "this is not a particularly deep oxygen zone , despite the overall dimness of sn2004eo , and it is comparable to most other sneia @xcite .",
    "the absence of carbon is noticeable : no carbon features are present that can be modelled , and the upper limit as constrained by the early spectra is very low ( a few percent in the outer zones ) .",
    "this is also a feature of most sneia , which may indicate partial burning of carbon to oxygen in the entire progenitor .",
    "ime dominate at velocities between 7000 and 12000 .",
    "silicon is the most abundant ime , followed by sulphur and magnesium .",
    "the abundances of sodium and calcium are much smaller .",
    "ime are present out to the highest velocities surveyed by our spectral models , at a level of @xmath46% by mass .",
    "they do not extend significantly below @xmath47 , indicating again that the innermost part of the ejecta was completely burned to nse . among the nse isotopes ,",
    "@xmath0ni  is the most abundant species between 3000 and 7000 , extending out to @xmath45 , while stable nse isotopes ( mostly stable fe ) dominate the inner 3000 , as discussed in the previous section .",

    "the outer extent of the ime is similar in sne 2004eo and 2002bo , confirming the result of @xcite .",

    "it is instructive to verify the effect on the spectral fits of adopting different parameters . in figures 5a and",
    "5b we show the variation induced in the synthetic spectra by randomly varying the velocity boundaries of the various abundance shells by up to 15% ( fig .",
    "5a ) and the abundances by up to 25% ( fig .",
    "a relatively small change in the position of the shells can affect the result significantly .",
    "the sensitivity to abundance within a fixed shell is smaller , and the uncertainty can be estimated to be @xmath48% in the photospheric epoch .",
    "the examples shown here address the issue of fitting a particular spectrum .",
    "when trying to fit the entire time series , many of the solutions that may seem acceptable based on a single epoch do not result in a consistent fit of the spectral evolution .",
    "the masses of the nse elements are estimated mostly from the nebular model , and have a smaller uncertainty .",
    "in paper i we could show that using the abundances derived from the spectral analysis to estimate the opacity in the ejecta a more accurate synthetic light curve could be obtained than any based on theoretical explosion models .",
    "in particular , the mixing out of @xmath0ni  is not predicted in most models , which therefore fail to reproduce the early rise of the light curve .",
    "unfortunately , the situation is not quite as good for sn2004eo , possibly because there are fewer very early spectra , which makes it difficult to constrain the abundances above 15000with high accuracy . in figure 5 the bolometric light curve of sn2004eo @xcite",
    "is compared to a synthetic bolometric light curve obtained with a montecarlo code based on that described in @xcite . in the calculation ,",
    "the optical photons produced by the deposition of @xmath3-rays and positrons diffuse in the ejecta , where they encounter an optical opacity which is determined by the abundance of the different isotopic species as follows :    @xmath49 + 0.01 [ m({\\rm ime})/{m_{\\odot}}]\\ ] ]    the synthetic light curve based on the abundance distribution derived from spectrum synthesis ( fig . 5 , solid curve )",
    "resembles the observed one , with a peak at @xmath50 days , but it lies below the `` observed '' one by @xmath51mag at all epochs before @xmath52 days , although the tail is well reproduced .    the error introduced by the assumption of a sharp photosphere in the models for the photospheric - epoch spectra can be assessed by verifying in the synthetic light curve what fraction of the @xmath3-ray deposition occurs above the momentary photosphere .",
    "for example , at maximum light less than 10% of the deposition occurs above the photosphere , which is then located at @xmath53 , above the bulk of @xmath0ni .",
    "this fraction increases to @xmath54% by day 40 , when the photosphere is well within the @xmath0ni  zone .",
    "however , the nebular spectrum covers velocities out to @xmath55 , and so the uncertainty caused by the use of a sharp photosphere is limited .",
    "one of the possible reasons for the discrepancy betwen the synthetic and observed light curves is the estimate of the mass and distribution of @xmath0ni .",
    "the synthetic light curve can be improved by changing the @xmath0ni  mass and distribution .",
    "some possibilities are shown in figure 6 .",
    "first , if the amount of @xmath0ni  in the outer shells was underestimated because of poor spectral coverage or uncertainties in the spectral modelling at early times , a different rising part could be obtained .",
    "adding @xmath0ni  at velocities above 10000improves the rising part up to @xmath56 one week before maximum , but it still does not match the peak . in order further to improve the fit , it is necessary to play with the distribution of @xmath0ni  in a way that is not justified by the spectroscopic analysis . a model with enhanced @xmath0ni  in the region between 7000 and 10000  ( fig .",
    "6 , dashed line ) results in a better fit of the peak .",
    "this model has @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . however , because of the very large @xmath0ni  mass this model is much too bright on the tail .",
    "one further epicycle is then to remove @xmath0ni  at low velocities , below 6000 .",
    "this model ( fig .",
    "6 , dotted line ) , with a total @xmath0ni  mass of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , fits the entire light curve , but is not physically justified .",
    "for example , a nebular spectrum based on this distribution of @xmath0ni  would not at all resemble the observations .",
    ". in the model shown as a dashed green line @xmath0ni  was added at velocities between 7000 and 10000 , for a total m(@xmath0ni ) @xmath61 .",
    "this model fits the peak of the light curve , but is too bright on the tail . in the model shown as a dotted red line the additional @xmath0ni  at intermdiate velocities was compensated for by removing @xmath0ni  at velocities below 6000 , for a total m(@xmath0ni ) @xmath62",
    "this model provides a good fit to the light curve but it is not physically motivated .",
    "the model from the abundance stratification [ m(@xmath0ni ) @xmath63 $ ] is also shown for comparison ( thin blue line ) .",
    ", width=336 ]    the question is then what is the source of the discrepancy .",
    "there are at least 4 possibilities :    \\1 ) calibration of the nebular spectrum .",
    "incorrect calibration would result in an incorrect estimate of the @xmath0ni  content in the inner ejecta , and hence in an incorrect light curve .",
    "this is a possibility since there is scatter in the photometry obtained near the epoch of the nebular spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is however unlikely to result in a different relative distribution of @xmath0niand stable fe - group isotopes , as this would directly affect the ionization balance and hence the line strength ratios .",
    "\\2 ) estimate of the amount of @xmath0ni  in the region between 7000 and 10000 .",
    "the early - time spectra are relatively insensitive to variations of the @xmath0nimass in this velocity range : these layers are visible above the photosphere only after maximum , when most @xmath0ni  has decayed to @xmath0co  but only a small fraction of this has decayed to @xmath0fe .",
    "fe lines are therefore not greatly affected , and the effect of replacing nickel with cobalt is small .",
    "nebular spectra , on the other hand , are also not very sensitive to small variations of the @xmath0ni  content at these velocities because of the low overall density .",
    "\\3 ) estimate of the bolometric correction and its evolution .",
    "evidence for this may be the fact that even though the spectral fits at maximum require an input luminosity comparable to or somewhat lower than the corresponding @xmath64 , the synthetic spectra thus obtained match the optical part of the observed spectra but are too bright in the near ir .",
    "thus , the real value of @xmath64 at peak may actually be smaller than estimated in the bolometric light curve .",
    "\\4 ) uncertain treatment of the opacity .",
    "this is not likely to be a problem at late epochs , when the ejecta are transparent , but it may affect the light curve calculation near maximum",
    ". on the other hand , our synthetic light curve tracks the observed one quite well , the only problem being that it lies always below the data .",
    "this suggests that if there is a problem with the opacities , it lies in the @xmath3-ray opacity , but this is a quantity that is well known and is unlikely to be grossly in error .",
    "the part of the light curve where the optical opacity is actually very likely to be incorrectly treated is between roughly 50 and 100 days , when the sn is making the transition to the nebular phase .",
    "this however has no effect on the estimate of the mass of @xmath0ni  either at the peak or on the tail of the light curve .",
    "alternatively , a direct estimate of the mass of @xmath0ni  may be attempted using the prescription of @xcite : @xmath65 . with a bolometric light curve peak of @xmath66ergs@xmath67 ,",
    "this yields @xmath68 .",
    "this seems a very large value , given the results of the various light curve tests and the nebular spectrum .",
    "if we include @xmath0ni  in the inner part of the ejecta , as suggested by the spectroscopic modelling and by most explosion models , we can accommodate at most @xmath69 of @xmath0ni .",
    "this yields a good fit to the peak of the light curve , but it is too bright on the tail and it can not reproduce the nebular spectra .",
    "additionally , in all light curve models we have presented , we obtain a relation @xmath70 , which again suggests that @xmath71 .",
    "the higher efficiency of conversion of @xmath3-ray energy to optical light in our models with respect to the assumptions of @xcite depends essentially on adopting a realistic density profile and a distribution of @xmath0ni  in the ejecta .",
    "given all of the above uncertainties , a conservative estimate of the @xmath0ni  mass of sn2004eo is @xmath72 .",
    "despite the relatively small number of spectra available for modelling , a thorough description of the composition of the ejecta of sn2004eo was obtained .",
    "this sn had a small @xmath0ni  mass for a normal snia .",
    "the exact value is made somewhat uncertain by difficulties with deriving the bolometric light curve as well as by uncertainties in the calibration of the nebular spectrum and the behaviour of the optical opacity .",
    "still our estimate , @xmath72 , places sn2004eo among the least luminous normal sneia , along with the template sn1992a .    a possible caveat concerns the total mass of the ejecta and the energy of the explosion .",
    "the assumption of the chandrasekhar mass and of the w7 model yields a rather sensible abundance pattern and reasonably good synthetic spectra , suggesting that any deviation from that model should not be very large . had the mass been significantly smaller , in our w7-based models we would have had to `` hide '' mass in elements that make a small contribution to the spectra : most likely oxygen in the photospheric phase and silicon in the nebular phase .",
    "this was however not required , and most elements included in the mixture do contribute significantly to the spectra at the appropriate epochs , via absorption lines at early times or emission lines in the nebular phase . as for the kinetic energy , applying the formula of @xcite , @xmath73 10^{51}$ ] erg , we obtain @xmath74erg .",
    "this is somewhat less than the original w7 energy ( @xmath75erg ) , but not so much less : the smaller contribution of burning to @xmath0ni  is in fact compensated by the larger production of ime , which contribute to the kinetic energy only @xmath76% less per unit mass synthesised , and by the large production of stable nse isotopes , which actually contribute more to the kinetic energy than burning to @xmath0ni .",
    "the main uncertainty regarding the kinetic energy comes from the outer extent of burning to nse and the degree to which the outer carbon and oxygen were burned to ime .",
    "the zone between 9000 and 11000 still contains some oxygen .",
    "a signature of the lack of incomplete burning products at high velocities may be seen in the lack of hvf s , at least at the epochs sampled by our spectra .    in conclusion ,",
    "within the uncertainties sn2004eo was a chandrasekhar - mass explosion of a co white dwarf that produced a smaller amount of @xmath0ni  than average ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the amount of stable fe - group material ( @xmath2 ) , is somewhat larger than average @xcite .",
    "the outer extent of ime ( @xmath78 ) is similar to most sneia [ the exception being those defined as high velocity gradient by @xcite ] , so that the ime production was larger than average ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "since there is no indication of unburned carbon , most of the remaining @xmath79 of material should be unburned oxygen",
    ".    such a low luminosity explosion may be the result of a strong initial deflagration phase , during which nse material is produced and the star pre - expands , so that if and when a delayed detonation occurs this is not very effective , burning material at low density mostly to ime only @xcite .",
    "uncertainties arise mostly from the spectral calibration , the bolometric correction and the lack of extremely early data , calling for more complete coverage of sneia so that the parameters of the explosions can be derived with even greater precision .",
    "nevertheless , sn2004eo is an important piece in the description of the variety of sneia and in the effort to understand their origin .",
