    "with the large efforts currently being carried out with the hubble space telescope to measure cepheids in distant galaxies to define the extra - galactic distance scale , it is becoming more important than ever to proper understand the cepheid p - l relation .",
    "not only is it important to determine the zero - point of the relation but in particular it is important to determine the effect of metallicity on this zero point as the lmc , which is used as a reference , is more metal - poor than most galaxies available for study with hst .",
    "the baade - wesselink method provides luminosities for individual stars and by analyzing stars spanning a range of metallicities the associated luminosity shift can be determined .",
    "five smc cepheids with periods between 13.5 and 16.7 days spanning a range in @xmath1 color from 0.52 to 0.80 have been observed .",
    "the stars are located in the south - western part of the smc , about 1 degree from the main body of the galaxy .",
    "the dataset consists of light curves ( @xmath2 points per star ) in bvri based on ccd photometry from las campanas , ctio and eso as well as radial velocity curves ( @xmath3 points per star ) based on echelle spectroscopy from las campanas and supplemented at eso .",
    "one star , hv1328 , exhibits a very low amplitude in the radial velocity curve and we have so far not been able to successfully derive a distance to this star .",
    "this star has been disregarded in the following leaving us with a sample of four stars .",
    "we have used the recent calibration by fouqu and gieren ( 1997 ) of the barnes - evans ( 1976 ) realization of the baade - wesselink method .",
    "this calibration is based on the most recent interferometric diameters of giants and super - giants .",
    "they calibrate the surface brightness parameter @xmath4 as a function of the color - index @xmath5 and find the relation :    @xmath6    the surface brightness parameter @xmath4 together with the visual magnitude gives the angular diameter @xmath7 of the star through the relation :    @xmath8    from the integrated radial velocity curve , the linear displacement of the stellar surface can be determined as a function of phase and the method determines the stellar radius and distance to the star from the fit to the pairs of linear displacement and angular diameters at different phases ( see panel @xmath9 in figure  [ fig - svb ] ) .",
    "gieren et al . (",
    "1997 ) show that the calibration for the @xmath10 index is in excellent agreement with the main - sequence fitting results to the galactic calibrating cepheids in open clusters and associations .",
    "the surface brightness parameter is basically a temperature measure and it is based on a color - index .",
    "consequently it is very likely that there is a certain dependence on abundance on the relation .",
    "as the smc cepheids are of significantly lower metallicity than the cepheids in the galaxy and the calibrating stars , we have to determine the size of this effect and correct the calibration accordingly before we apply it to the smc stars .",
    "we have used kurucz model atmospheres at fixed gravity to modify the calibration above for different assumed metallicities .",
    "these modified calibrations have then been used to determine baade - wesselink luminosities for our sample of stars .",
    "the trend is largely linear and shows an effect of the order @xmath11  mag per dex but with some differences from star to star .",
    "following luck et al . ( 1998 ) we adopt an abundance difference of @xmath12 between the smc and the galaxy . using the corrected calibration of the surface brightness parameter",
    "we can apply the baade - wesselink method to our stars to determine individual radii , distances and absolute magnitudes .",
    "one critical point in the implementation of the barnes - evans method using the @xmath5 index is the choice of fitting method as there is a significant scatter in the data points .",
    "however , as we here are interested in the comparison with the absolute magnitudes of the galactic cepheids determined by gieren et al .",
    "( 1998 ) using the very same calibration , we have to adopt the same fitting scheme as they have used , i.e. performing linear regression with the angular diameter as the dependent variable . in this way",
    "we derive the values in table [ tab.fgno_bisec ] .",
    "the typical uncertainty on the distance modulus to a single star is about @xmath13  mag .",
    "an example of the fit to the angular diameter as a function of linear radius displacement is shown in panel @xmath9 of figure  [ fig - svb ] .    unfortunately gieren et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find a systematic offset of 16% or 0.32  mag between the absolute magnitudes determined on the basis of the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 color indices .",
    "as they also find that the @xmath10 results are superior in accuracy and precision over the @xmath5 results , we have to correct for this offset before comparing with the results from gieren et al .",
    "work is in progress together with gieren and collaborators to obtain near - ir data for the smc cepheids so we can repeat the analysis without the added uncertainty from this offset .",
    "l r r r r & hv822 & hv1333 & hv1335 & hv1345 + @xmath16 & 18.90 & 19.03 & 19.09 & 18.70 + @xmath17 & 0.07 & 0.11 & 0.23 & 0.18 + @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 + @xmath22(pl ) & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 + @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 + @xmath32(corr ) & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 +",
    "to determine the effect of metallicity on the zero point of the p - l relation , we attempt to measure the offset between the p - l relation for smc cepheids and the relation for galactic cepheids . as the p - l relation is a statistical relation and not a direct physical relation ,",
    "we need to compare the ridge lines for the two populations . for the galactic cepheids",
    "this is already done by gieren et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for the smc sample",
    "we compare our visual magnitudes with the magnitudes from the sample of laney and stobie ( 1994 ) , all corrected for depth effects following their method .",
    "we find that our four stars are all on the faint side of the distribution and we need to add an average offset of @xmath37  mag to bring our stars to the smc ridge line .",
    "this together with the systematic offset described above ( @xmath38  mag ) leads to the corrected magnitude offsets @xmath32(corr ) listed in table  [ tab.fgno_bisec ] .",
    "the weighted average of these offsets is @xmath39 which we combine with the metallicity offset of @xmath40 to obtain @xmath41}\\ , } = -0.45\\pm0.11 $ ]  mag / dex . to the intrinsic uncertainty we have to add an estimate for the systematic uncertainties from the corrections performed above .",
    "we estimate this to contribute of the order 0.1  mag giving a final dependence of @xmath42 .",
    "consequently our preliminary results shows evidence for a significant metallicity effect in good agreement with other recent observational results ( f.ex .",
