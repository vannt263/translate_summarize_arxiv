    "in the last few years , large radio surveys such as the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) @xcite , the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) @xcite and atlas @xcite have revealed different populations of radio emitting objects .",
    "however , very few stars have been found and nearly all known radio stars have been detected by targeted observations directed at small samples of stars thought likely to be radio emitters .",
    "the radio detection of different star types , covering different stages of stellar evolution @xcite , strongly suffers from limited sensitivity and from selection bias as they have been obtained by targeted observations aimed to address a specific problem related to a particular aspect of radio emission .",
    "this approach has proven to be quite productive but it is biased against discovering unknown , unexpected , or intrinsically rare objects , preventing a good knowledge of radio stars at the sub - mjy level . in consequence , at the moment , it is quite difficult to provide a trustworthy forecast on the real potential of the square kilometer array ( ska ) and its pathfinders in the field of stellar radio astronomy . from an analysis aimed to point out the stellar population in the first survey , @xcite concluded that even at a threshold of @xmath6 stellar radio emission is quite rare .",
    "similar results were found by @xcite .",
    "these results are not surprising as first and other radio deep surveys were designed for extragalactic studies and only regions at high galactic latitude were covered .",
    "the space density of stars , unlike that of extragalactic sources , varies with galactic latitude , being much more concentrated in the disk . to overcome this problem ,",
    "it is clear that a deep blind survey , carried out in a sky patch well suited for stellar work , is necessary .",
    "the improvement of the observational capabilities have led to the discovery of radio emission in a broad variety of stellar objects from all stages of stellar evolution . in many cases ,",
    "radio observations have revealed astrophysical phenomena and stellar activity not detectable by other means .",
    "broadly speaking , the brightest stellar radio emission appears to be associated with active stellar phenomena such as flares , related to the presence of a strong and/or variable magnetic field , or mass - loss @xcite .",
    "much of our knowledge of microwave emission from radio stars comes from the study of active stars and binary systems as a large fraction of these have been found to be strong radio sources .",
    "their radio flux density is highly variable and is very probably driven by the magnetic activity whose manifestations are observed in other spectral regions @xcite .",
    "the radio flux arises from the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and mildly relativistic particles , i.e. gyrosynchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "the same emission mechanism is at the origin of radio emission from pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars and x - ray binaries .",
    "non - thermal radio emission also originates from shocks of colliding winds in massive binaries and from pulsars .",
    "there is growing evidence that radio flares can also occur as narrow band , rapid , intense and highly polarized ( up to @xmath7 ) radio bursts , that are observed especially at low frequency ( @xmath8 ) . for their extreme characteristics ,",
    "such radio flares have generally been interpreted as a result of coherent emission mechanisms .",
    "coherent burst emission has been observed in different classes of stellar objects : rs cvns and flare stars @xcite , ultra cool dwarfs @xcite and chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars @xcite .",
    "all have , as common ingredient , a strong magnetic field , which may be variable , and a source of energetic particles .",
    "the number of stars where coherent emission has been detected is still limited to a few tens , because of the limited sensitivity of the available instruments . thermal emission ( bremsstrahlung emission ) is expected from winds associated with wolf ",
    "rayet ( wr ) and ob stars , shells surrounding planetary nebulae ( pne ) and novae and jets from symbiotic stars and class 0 pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars @xcite .",
    "we have started the stellar continuum originating from radio physics in ourgalaxy ( scorpio ) project to carry out , for the first time , a blind deep ( @xmath1 ) radio survey in a sky patch well suited for stellar work , using atca observations at @xmath0 .",
    "this survey has the best potential to enlarge the stellar radio emitting population , without suffering from selection criteria based on some peculiar aspects observed in other spectral bands .",
    "moreover , it will provide new insights for a better comprehension of the physics of particular classes of stellar systems and of plasma processes in a wider context .",
    "finally , the chosen frequency ( i.e. @xmath0 ) constitutes the best choice to answer the key question of how common is coherent radio emission from stellar and sub - stellar systems . as the space distribution of different types of stars in the patch selected for our survey",
    "can be assumed to be typical for the galactic disk population , results from such a survey will provide us with a clear forecast on the potential of ska and its pathfinders in the field of stellar radio astronomy .",
    "in addition to the scientific outcomes , results from the survey will be of immense value in shaping the strategy of the deep ( @xmath9 ) surveys already planned with the ska pathfinders . among them , the evolutionary map of the universe ( emu ; @xcite ) , a deep , almost full sky ( 75 per cent ) survey to be carried out at @xmath0 , is one of the major programs already approved to be conducted with the australian ska pathfinder ( askap ) .",
    "emu is expected to detect and catalogue about 70 million galaxies , and will also make an atlas of the galactic plane to an unprecedented sensitivity and resolution .    the scorpio project will have a profound impact on the galactic plane component of the emu survey . specifically , it will guide emu design in identifying issues arising from the complex continuum structure associated with the galactic plane and from the variable sources in the galactic plane . moreover",
    ", it will contribute in evaluating the most appropriate method for source finding and extraction for sources embedded in the diffuse emission expected at low galactic latitude .",
    "the selected field needs to satisfy the following requirements : ( i ) it should contain a sufficient number of stars , with a good spread in different classes of stellar objects thought to be radio emitters ; ( ii ) it should contain sources already classified as radio emitters to enable verification of the data ; ( iii ) it should have been already observed in other spectral regions to gather additional information to help with the classification of new , unexpected objects or to allow complete studies for the classified objects .",
    "the selected field is namely @xmath10 region centred at galactic coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath12 . because our aim is to get statistical information from the survey",
    ", we choose this sky patch only on the a priori knowledge of the presence of a significative number of stars in it .",
    "moreover , being in the direction of the scorpio constellation , it offers the possibility to probe different radio star populations at various distances across the galaxy . as added value , in the field",
    "there is also the sco ob1 association , whose core is the young ( @xmath13 ) stellar cluster ngc 6231 @xcite ( @xmath14 ) , consisting of 964 stars , where radio continuum emission from the massive star population has been already detected @xcite and x - ray properties of both ob and pms populations have been derived @xcite .",
    "there are , in total , eight open clusters of stars and stellar associations inside the scorpio field , as shown in table[cluster ] .",
    "[ dbs2003 ]  176 and [ dbs2003 ]  178 are two clusters of stars detected in the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite .",

    "our source extraction method is biased against extended sources . however , a visual inspection of the final map points out the presence of 17 of this kind of sources falling in the scorpio field . in particular , there are many roundish structures recalling what several authors named as `` bubbles '' @xcite .",
    "bubbles are pervasive throughout the entire galactic plane and have been mainly discovered by means of the new extended survey conducted with spitzer , namely glimpse @xcite and mipsgal @xcite as they are quite often associated with extended dusty structures .",

    "however , there is growing observational evidence that some bubbles can be related to massive evolved stars , such as lbv , wrs and snrs @xcite or with pne @xcite . despite the apparent similar morphologies",
    ", there are many differences between the emission characteristics which stand out clearly when different maps , obtained at different ir and radio bands , are compared . as an example , bubbles associated with massive star formation regions have an extended @xmath16 emitting region embracing the more compact @xmath18 one , usually co - spatial with the ionized region , traced by the radio .",
    "this is interpreted as a signature of a pdr , traced by the pahs emission at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the emission characteristic of a bubble associated with an evolved star has a more complex structure .",
    "the dusty envelope is usually brighter and more extended at @xmath18 @xcite but the ionized region can be well contained or co - spatial or even more extended with respect to the @xmath18 emission @xcite .",
    "this is interpreted as a result of the very complex dust distribution in the circumstellar envelope as consequence of different mass - loss episodes that can occur during the evolution of the central star .    in the following",
    "we will provide a few examples of extended sources detected in the scorpio pilot .",
    "some of these are associated with already known galactic sources , while others are unclassified .",
    "our work provides the first high resolution radio continuum maps for most of these sources , revealing the details of the ionized gas .    in presenting our results",
    "we also consider the dusty environment associated with the radio sources and display the radio maps together with maps of the regions provided by glimpse and higal @xcite , that trace the warm and cooler dust distribution in the surrounding regions .      the stellar cluster @xmath19dbs2003@xmath15 $ ]  176 is associated with a multiple bubble ( s16 and s17 ) detected in the glimpse survey @xcite .",

    "a flux density measurement at @xmath23 ( 176.9 mjy ) has also been reported for scorpio1_320 and the source has been tentatively classified as a massive young stellar object ( myso ) candidate @xcite .",

    "the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the scorpio project and to present the results of the pilot observations .",
    "some conclusions can however be drawn on the basis of these preliminary results . in spite of the large number of objects located in the selected field and classified as stars , according to simbad",
    ", we found very few matches that definitively associate scorpio radio components with stellar objects . among the matches with the simbad database , 10 sources are classified as stars .",
    "all of them appear related to thermal emission and associated with an early - type star ( see section [ sec : comp_comp_cat ] ) . however",
    ", this could be an effect of the higher number of stars with spectral classification ` b - type ' in the selected field as indicated by the distribution of spectral types shown in fig.[spectraltypes ] .",
    "the mere presence in the field of stars belonging to a class thought to be radio emitting is a necessary but not sufficient condition to detect them , as a series of requirements needs to be satisfied : a sufficient mass - loss rate and ionizing uv field , for thermal emitters , and a sufficient magnetic field strength and energetic particle density , for non - thermal ones .",
    "distances also play their role and variability is expected in most of the non - thermal radio emitters .",
    "all the above considerations translate into a real difficulty to quantify the number of stellar objects we expect to detect in a specific patch of the sky .",
    "we have detection rates going from 20 per cent for ob stars @xcite and 25 per cent for cp stars @xcite to 30 - 40 per cent for the active binary systems @xcite .",
    "however , all information collected so far comes from small samples biased towards some kind of peculiarities observed in other spectral regimes and the quoted detection rates are to be considered as upper limits and are probably overestimated .",
    "as indicated in section 4.4 , 487 of the 614 scorpio sources have a counterpart in at least one of the inspected catalogues .",
    "in particular , for our purposes , it is important to analyse how many scorpio sources have matches in stellar catalogues .",
    "the nomad ( naval observatory merged astrometric dataset ) catalogue is a major stellar catalog which contains data from the hipparcos , tycho-2 , ucac-2 and usno - b1 catalogues and is supplemented by photometric information from the 2mass final release point source catalogue .",
    "as indicated in table [ tab_match ] , most of the scorpio sources found in nomad do not have an optical counterpart ( 301/320 nomad matches are actually from 2mass ) .",
    "this may indicate that a significant fraction of the scorpio sources represents a reddened stellar / galactic population .",
    "it is possible that this reddened population has some contaminants , namely some background galaxies . in principle",
    ", we may use the wise colours to separate extragalactic versus galactic sources , as those have revealed to be very effective in extragalactic surveys @xcite .",
    "stars are characterized by wise colours clustering around zero magnitude while different classes of extragalactic objects are clearly separated from them because of their redder colours . however , there are some galactic objects , with extended dusty envelopes ( agb stars , ysos and pne ) that have wise colours similar to those of the different extragalactic populations and they occupy the same regions in the colour - colour diagram @xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears that , in our case , the wise colour - colour diagram is of limited use for pointing out possible extragalactic contaminants and further ancillary observations are necessary .",
    "our observations , with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution at @xmath5 , have allowed , for the first time , to point out radio emission associated to some extended sources , many of which are classified as galactic bubbles .",
    "for some of them the scorpio map is the first radio detection , while for the sources already known to be associated with a radio source , the scorpio map constitutes an impressive improvement with respect previous observations . furthermore , comparison with existing mid - ir / fir images has helped to classify some of the objects .",
