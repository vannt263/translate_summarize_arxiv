    "recently , blitz et al .  ( 1999 ) have shown that the hvcs , clouds of atomic hydrogen inconsistent with near - circular rotation about the galactic center , are well explained if they are members of the local group .",
    "a simple dynamical model can replicate both the observed distribution on the sky as well as the observed kinematics of the ensemble of the hvcs . in their paper ,",
    "blitz et al .  ( 1999 ) made several predictions ; among them are that hvcs have h@xmath5 surface brightnesses less than those measured in the magellanic stream , metallicities of 0.1 solar or less , and internal pressures p / k @xmath0 1 - 10 k ; the last of these is inferred from the self - gravity of hvcs .",
    "all of these predictions have been subsequently confirmed ( weiner et al .",
    "2000 ; wakker et al .  1999",
    "; sembach et al .",
    "only one set of observations now seems to present problems for the model : three deep , blind extragalactic  surveys , two made at arecibo ( zwaan et al .",
    "1997 ; spitzak & schneider 1998 ) , and one at parkes ( banks et al .",
    "1999 ) .    if the hvcs are extragalactic and part of the local group , as blitz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argue , then extragalactic analogues should be observable ; many examples have indeed been reported in the literature ( blitz et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the blind  surveys have also found many uncatalogued  clouds , but on closer inspection , all but one of the detections are found to harbor galaxies , albeit often of very low surface brightness . because stars have not been detected in hvcs , they have been assumed to be starless systems .",
    "no such systems have been found by either zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) or banks et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; and only one potentially starless system has been found in the spitzak & schneider ( 1998 ) survey .",
    "the sensitivity of both surveys appears to be high enough and the velocity coverage large enough , that at least a few hvc analogues should have been detected in these surveys .    on the other hand , it is unclear whether the lowest surface brightness galaxies found in the optical follow - up to the  detections would have been detected if those systems were located in the local group .",
    "these galaxies , which compose a significant fraction of the zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and spitzak & schneider ( 1998 )  identifications , appear morphologically similar to the local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which have been observed to be generally gas - free ( mateo 1998 ) . at local group distances such low surface brightness systems would be extended and relatively difficult to identify in existing surveys . however , with concerted searching , a number of dsph galaxies have recently been discovered in the local group ( whiting et al .",
    "1997 ; armandroff , davies , & jacoby 1998 ; karachentsev & karachentseva 1999 ; gallart et al .  1999 ) , suggesting that there might be similar , or even lower surface brightness galaxies associated with hvcs .",
    "a search for low surface brightness galaxies in hvcs is currently underway , but as a first step , we decided to examine the newly discovered local group dwarfs for 21-cm emission using the leiden - dwingeloo  survey ( lds - hartmann & burton 1997 ) to see if any are associated with hvcs .",
    "after the detection of  toward and v , and its subsequent identification as hvc 368 in the compilation of wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) , we decided to reexamine the  content of all of the dsph galaxies in the local group ; the results are presented in  3 .",
    "we have found  toward four galaxies in which it had not previously been detected , and found  more extended than previously thought in two others .",
    "the  found toward two galaxies are catalogued hvcs . in ",
    "4 we examine the implications of the  observations and infer the existence of a hot gaseous corona around the milky way and m31 with a mean density of @xmath6 . rather than being gas - poor , the dsph galaxies are often gas - rich , but with rather extended  envelopes .",
    "the sensitivity of the lds is about 70 mk in a 1  velocity channel ; its angular resolution is 36 .",
    "the survey covers the entire northern sky down to a declination of -30at a sampling interval of 30 . at a distance of 100 kpc ,",
    "the beam is 1.05 kpc .",
    "its effective velocity coverage of -450 @xmath7 + 400  is sufficient to detect all local group emission down to a 5@xmath8 column density n(h)/@xmath9 2 ( ) @xmath10 averaged over the beam ( @xmath11 is the full width at half maximum of the  emission ) .",
    "the survey also has the virtue of having flat baselines which makes it possible to detect very low level emission at velocities away from the normal galactic emission .",
    "we initially examined a five point cross centered at the optical position of all of the galaxies catalogued as dsph or dsph / dirr in the compilation of mateo ( 1998 ) , but excluded those also classified as de or e systems because of their much higher surface brightness .",
    "we also examined the galaxies subsequently identified as possible local group dsph galaxies by karachentsev & karachentseva ( 1999 ) and gallart et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which could be found in the lds .",
    "if a galaxy sits between grid points of the survey , we examined a somewhat larger area .",
    "a number of the galaxies were found to have 21-cm emission confined to a small area coincident with or very close to the dsph at velocities outside the range normally associated with galactic emission .",
    "one can estimate the probability of a chance coincidence of a dsph with a cloud along the line of sight from the surface filling fraction of small hvcs ( @xmath12 1 deg ) in the wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) compilation .",
    "the hvcs comprise all of the  emission not associated with galaxies outside the range of normal galactic emission and have the same range of radial velocities as the dsphs .",
    "the total area on the sky of small hvcs is less than 300 deg , though this number is somewhat uncertain at the 50% level because of the sparse sampling of the wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) catalogue .",
    "it is certainly an upper limit , though , based on the higher resolution mapping of about 20% of the smaller hvcs by blitz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and by braun & burton ( 1999 ) .",
    "the hvcs are spread all over the sky with some concentration in the general directions of the barycenter and antibarycenter of the local group , thus the probability of a chance coincidence with a cloud that subtends an angle of less than 1 deg is @xmath13 .",
    "equivalently , a positional coincidence with such a cloud is significant at the @xmath14 level .",
    "we therefore consider the likelihood of a chance coincidence of a dsph with a small  cloud to be sufficiently low that it is indicative of a real physical association , even if no velocity is available for the galaxy . indeed , in a sample of @xmath020 objects such as considered here , the probability of a chance positional coincidence of _ any _ dsph with an  cloud is @xmath00.2 , and the number of detections is about 50 times higher .    in the case where velocity information is available , the probability of an optical and  velocity coincidence within 2@xmath8 of the velocity dispersion of @xmath013  ( blitz et al .",
    "1999 ) is about 0.06 within the velocity range in which hvcs are detected : about 800 .",
    "this probability must be increased somewhat because we consider only velocities outside the range of normal galactic emission , but in the directions in which most dsphs are found , the galactic emission is not wider than about 200 .",
    "the joint probability of velocity and spatial coincidence is thus @xmath15 .",
    "probabilities of chance coincidences can be estimated for individual galaxies and are done so where appropriate in the text .    if emission was found to be associated with a galaxy , based on positional coincidence alone , or where possible , joint position and velocity coincidence , we averaged all of the profiles where emission was evident .",
    "one or more gaussians were then fit to the averaged spectrum in order to determine a central velocity and velocity extent of the emission .",
    "the maps are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the values of the central velocity , fwhm velocity extent , and brightness temperature of the gaussian fits to the position - averaged spectra are listed in table 1 .",
    "the derived values for m(@xmath16 ) and @xmath17 , the  mass and the solid angle of the cloud , are not corrected for source convolution with the telescope beam .",
    "we then searched a 7@xmath187  area to see if the emission is localized around the target galaxy or whether it exists over a more extended area . in two cases ,",
    "rather extended emission was found and the maps are shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the individual maps are discussed in  [ sec : galaxies ] below .",
    "some of the apparent detections were quite weak and jay lockman kindly observed some of these with the nrao 140telescope prior to its shutdown in late july 1999 to obtain confirmation .",
    "in most cases the observations were about 4 times longer than those of the lds .",
    "the beam of the 140telescope is about 20at the frequency of the 21-cm line .    finally , we searched the catalogues of hulsbosch & wakker ( 1988 ) and wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) to see whether any of the  clouds are catalogued hvcs .",
    "we found two such cases , the cloud associated with and v is hvc 368 , and the cloud associated with sculptor is hvc 561 .",
    "lgs 3 had been previously detected at three positions and ddo 210 at one position on the 1@xmath181  sampling grid of hulsbosch & wakker ( 1988 ) .",
    "the temperature - weighted mean galactic latitude and longitude , as well as the  column density and mass for each cloud can be found in table 1 .",
    "the derived  masses assume that the emission is at the distance of the galaxy .",
    "the non - detections are listed in table 2 .",
    "the observed properties of the detected clouds are similar to one another and to the typical properties of hvcs , but are generally weaker than  detections of local group dirr , irr , or spiral galaxies .",
    "we have made new  detections toward and iii , and v , leo i and sextans .",
    "in addition , the  emission toward lgs 3 , ddo 210 , and sculptor is found to be considerably more extended than previously thought .",
    "in all , of 21 confirmed local group dsph galaxies ,  is detected in apparent association with 10 galaxies .",
    "two galaxies are too far south to have been observed in the leiden - dwingeloo survey , and several probable non - detections are somewhat ambiguous .",
    "one galaxy previously reported as a detection , antlia ( fouqu et al .",
    "1990 ) , is probably an instrumental artifact .",
    "there are 9 non - detections , not including the de systems or the two unconfirmed candidate dsph galaxies of karachentsev & karachentseva ( 1999 ) .",
    "four galaxies are below the declination limit of the lds , but two of these , phoenix and tucana , have been observed and detected in  by others ( young & lo 1997 ; oosterloo et al .",
    "1996 ) ; they are therefore included in the list of detections .",
    "thus almost half of the confirmed local group dsph galaxies have been detected in , though only five of those detected have measured optical velocities as of this writing .",
    "attempts are actively underway by several groups to obtain more velocities .",
    "two of the galaxies shown in figure 1 exhibit emission close to , but not coincident with the target galaxy : leo i and sextans .",
    "this might explain why these two galaxies have not been previously detected in ; and why the detection of  toward tucana by oosterloo , da costa , & stavely - smith ( 1996 ) ought to be reinterpreted .",
    "these authors found a cloud very close to , but not coincident with tucana , in which the highest column density emission is offset by about 15  from the nucleus .",
    "oosterloo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) felt that the position offset implied that the  cloud and the galaxy are unrelated .",
    "we show in the next section , however , that the relationship between the  cloud and tucana is similar to other galaxies in our sample , particularly leo i , in which the velocity of the  and the galaxy are both measured and found to be in close agreement .",
    "we therefore include tucana in table 1 as a detection .        and",
    "iii is a rather problematic  detection .",
    "it appears to be clearly detected in the lds ( see figure 1 ) , and a confirmation spectrum of the galaxy taken with the 140telescope showed a much weaker component at low significance at the same velocity .",
    "the weakness of the 140spectrum is rather surprising , however , given the smaller beam and the longer integration time .",
    "the detection , nevertheless , does appear to be real , though of low significance .",
    "a measurement of the optical velocity of the galaxy or a deep  integration over the lds beam will confirm or refute this detection .",
    "the values given in table 1 are from the deeper 140observations .",
    "( nb : the referee , mario mateo , has pointed out that the optical velocity of this galaxy has recently been determined by ct , mateo , & sargent ( 2000 ) , and is within 1@xmath8 of the combined  and optical velocity uncertainties ) .",
    "the  non - detection reported by thuan & martin ( 1979 ) is for a 4beam at arecibo centered on the galaxy .",
    "the  mass given in table 1 is consistent with their upper limits , particularly if the  is not centered directly on the dsph , as is the case for several other galaxies .",
    "this is an intriguing case not only because of the apparent association of the  with the galaxy , but also because the  is listed as hvc 368 in the compilation of wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) .",
    "thus a measurement of the radial velocity of the galaxy that agrees with the  velocity would provide the second firm association of an hvc with a dsph ( see the discussion of sculptor below ) .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , however , hvc 368 lies quite close to hvc 287 , also known as complex h. the latter has an angular extent of @xmath0205 deg@xmath19 , and a velocity similar to hvc 368 . blitz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have argued that complex h lies beyond the @xmath040 kpc radius of the  disk of the galaxy , but probably not far beyond .",
    "the proximity of the two clouds and the similarity of their radial velocities suggests that the smaller cloud may be a fragment of the larger one , and may thus be an unrelated foreground object . in that case , the probability of a chance coincidence is much higher than the value of @xmath20 for the other dsph galaxies .",
    "we present additional arguments in  4 why this  cloud might be a chance superposition .",
    "a measurement of the optical velocity would clearly determine whether the  and the galaxy are associated .",
    "the  in this galaxy was previously observed by lo , sargent , & young ( 1993 ) at the vla , and the mass we obtain for the  emission centered on the galaxy is in good agreement with theirs , correcting for the different distances assumed .",
    "note , however the additional emission seen in figure 1 that is outside the lo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) field of view .",
    "the relatively strong emission seen at   = 35 ,  = -32is a narrow component at nearly the same velocity as the galaxy .",
    "the low level disconnected emission in figure 1 may not be real , but the  cloud associated with ddo 210 nevertheless appears to be considerably larger than that observed by lo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "there is a clear detection of an  cloud with a large velocity dispersion in the direction of this galaxy at a velocity close to , but slightly shifted from the velocity of the dsph .",
    "the uncertainty in the velocity of the line center is , however , relatively large and the width of the line comfortably encompasses the velocity of the galaxy .",
    "we show two maps in figure 3 . on",
    "the left is a map of the brightness temperature distribution over the full width of the  line .",
    "the map shows the extent of what appears to be highly fragmented  emission ; a larger map ( not shown ) indicates that this emission is confined to the area shown in the panel . as a check , we produced a map over the same area within @xmath2110  of the leo i optical velocity shown in the right hand panel of figure 3 .",
    "the  in this velocity range is confined to an area quite close to the galaxy , but surprisingly , no  is seen directly toward the galaxy itself .",
    "the full velocity extent of the  is much more extended , and is seen over an area of about 1020 deg@xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , since the  in the velocity range of leo i is so closely confined to the environs of the galaxy , it seems likely that all of the  is at the distance of the dsph .",
    "higher resolution mapping might make the association clearer .",
    "the  non - detection reported by knapp , kerr , & bowers ( 1978 ) was made with a single pointing of the 300 ft ( 91 m ) telescope at green bank and a 10beam ; it is consistent with the present detection .",
    "the  cloud in the vicinity of lgs 3 was noted by hulsbosch & wakker ( 1988 ) and is quite close to the galaxy , but the velocity centroid of most of the  differs from that of the galaxy by about 50 .",
    "this galaxy was mapped with the vla by young & lo ( 1997 ) who found an  cloud centered on the dsph within a few of the velocity of lgs 3 and a total  mass of @xmath22 .",
    "smoothing of the lds  profile at the position of the galaxy shows both the -285 component and a component centered at about -340 .",
    "a hint of the more extreme velocity can be seen in the 140spectrum shown by young & lo ( 1997 ) .",
    "the probability of two hvcs seen along the same line of sight that are this compact is about 10@xmath23 ( see  [ sec : analysis ] ) . while the large velocity difference between the cloud shown in figure 2 and the cloud mapped by young & lo ( 1997 ) is puzzling , the relation of the dsph to the cloud bears some resemblance to the other systems pictured in figure 1 .",
    "we discuss in  4 the possibility that the more negative velocity component may result from ram - pressure stripping .",
    "although the emission detected by young & lo ( 1997 ) is not seen in either the map or the spectrum shown in figure 1 , both are consistent with their detection .",
    "the peak flux density of this galaxy observed at the 140telescope is about 110 mjy , corresponding to an expected antenna temperature of 0.021 k when observed with the dwingeloo telescope .",
    "this is the strength at which the feature is seen , within the noise , in the lds at the position of the galaxy .",
    "the spectrum shown in figure 1 is an average of 6 positions at which the galaxy is detected ; the expected peak temperature of that feature is lowered by yet another factor of 2.5 ; a feature of that strength is too weak to be detected .",
    "both the spectrum and the map of this source are consistent with the observations of young & lo ( 1997 ) .",
    "pegasus has been previously mapped by lo , sargent , & young ( 1993 ) .",
    "the mass obtained with the lds data is in reasonable agreement with that of lo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) when account is taken of the different distances assumed and the possibility that some of the flux may be missed with the vla observations .",
    "although this galaxy is too far south for the lds , it has previously been mapped by carignan , demers , & ct ( 1991 ) , young & lo ( 1997 ) and st - germain et al .",
    "because this galaxy lies close to the main emission from the milky way , and its optical velocity has not yet been measured , it is unclear which of two relatively compact velocity components , if either , is associated with the galaxy .",
    "the properties listed in table 1 are from st - germain et al .",
    "they cite evidence suggesting that the lower mass ( i.e.  @xmath24 ) component is associated with the galaxy , in part because they find the larger mass component implausibly large .",
    "we follow their suggestion and use the lower value in figure 4 below . without a reliable single dish map however , it is unclear whether the interferometer recovers all of the flux associated with the galaxy . thus the mass quoted by st - germain et al .  ( 1999 ) should be considered a lower limit .",
    "although the emission from sextans shown in figure 1 is not centered on the galaxy , the velocity of the  emission is quite close to the optical velocity .",
    "the probability of a cloud outside the galaxy with a velocity within @xmath2115  of the galaxy is about 0.05 .",
    "the joint probability of a small cloud within 4 square degrees with a velocity outside of the normal galactic emission in such close agreement with the optical velocity is about @xmath25 .",
    "the cloud shown in figure 1 is therefore probably associated with the galaxy ; the edge of the  cloud is only about 1 kpc from the galaxy in projection .",
    "sculptor is a particularly interesting case because of the two - lobed  structure found by carignan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and because the emission associated with the galaxy is catalogued as hvc 561 in the compilation of wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) .",
    "the map of the galaxy shown in figure 1 is incomplete because the galaxy is beyond the southern declination limit of the lds .",
    "carignan et al .  (",
    "1998 ) were at pains to point out that the  emission in their map might only be a small fraction of the total because of the spatial filtering of their interferometric observations , and because the  extends to the limit of the spatial scale to which their observations are sensitive .",
    "a more complete map was recently published by carignan ( 1999 ) using the parkes 43-m telescope showing that the  associated with sculptor has an extent of about 2 , larger than that shown in figure 1 , but the total mass is not given .",
    "the mass given in table 1 is from the lds , but may be low by a factor of about 2 - 3 .",
    "tucana is below the southern declination limit for the lds , but was observed at the atna by oosterloo , da costa , & staveley - smith ( 1996 ) , who found an  cloud close to , but not quite coincident with the galaxy .",
    "the centroid of the emission is located only 15from the galaxy and some of the emission is as close as 1from it . the joint probability of such close agreement in position and velocity between the observed  and the optical galaxy is about 10@xmath26 , suggesting that the  cloud is indeed bound to the galaxy .",
    "furthermore the oosterloo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observations were done with the atna , and the map extends over a large fraction of the beam .",
    "it is therefore likely that the extent of the  emission is larger than that shown in their map , similar to what is observed in sculptor .",
    "the relationship of the  to the optical galaxy in this case is similar to galaxies such as leo i , and v , sculptor and possibly lgs 3 .",
    "the low probability of a chance superposition , together with the similarity to other systems , suggests that the  is indeed related to tucana .",
    "if the cloud is at the distance of the dsph , it has a mass of @xmath27 .      a number of the non - detections are somewhat ambiguous because the optical velocity of the galaxy is close to the galactic emission , or because a feature of marginal significance is present in the lds .",
    "high significance non - detections were made toward and ii , leo ii and and vii using the 140telescope with an rms noise temperature of about 35 mk in 1  channels .",
    "the non - detection toward leo ii is consistent with that of young ( 1999 ) .    a reported detection of antlia by fouqu et al .  ( 1990 )",
    "could not be reproduced , and is probably part of the emission from ngc 3109 entering a sidelobe of the telescope .",

    "the detection of  associated with many dsph galaxies suggests that rather than being gas - free systems , perhaps half of them are in fact gas - rich galaxies , with  that is a substantial fraction of the luminous mass , m@xmath28 , and in some cases exceeding it .",
    "if we take m@xmath28/l@xmath29 = 1 - 2 in solar units , then more than half of the galaxies in table 1 , about 25% of all of the dsphs , have  masses in excess of 50% of the luminous mass of the galaxy .",
    "most previous observations have concentrated on searching for  only at the central position of a galaxy largely because the beam of the  observations was as large or larger than the galaxy itself .",
    "the observations presented here show that sometimes the  avoids the nucleus of the galaxy and is seen over a large area around it ( e.g.  leo i ) .    with the exception of and v",
    ", there is little doubt that the  clouds shown in the maps in figure 1 are associated with the galaxies , even though optical radial velocities are not available for most dsphs .",
    "as discussed in  2 , the probability of a chance superposition with an  cloud is quite small , typically about 0.01 , and if a velocity is available , the probability is @xmath30 .",
    "if all of the galaxies shown in table 1 have ionized hydrogen masses equal to that of their atomic hydrogen , and if the  were smoothly distributed out to the same radius as the , the typical emission measure except for phoenix and tucana would be 10@xmath31  10@xmath26 @xmath32 pc , more than an order of magnitude below what is currently detectable .",
    "thus the dsphs might harbor substantial quantities of ionized gas in addition to what is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we might reasonably ask why some of the dsph galaxies have large , massive  envelopes ( such as leo i ) , why some have relatively wimpy  envelopes ( such as sextans and sculptor ) , and why some seem to be devoid of  entirely ( such as ursa minor and draco ) . to approach this question ,",
    "we have plotted the the  mass of each of the dsph and dirr galaxies in the local group as a function of the distance from the nearest giant spiral , either m31 or the milky way ( mw ) in figure 4a .",
    "the data for the dirr galaxies are taken from mateo ( 1998 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows a rather remarkable effect . with the exception of and v",
    ", no galaxy within 250 kpc of either m31 or the mw has an  mass in excess of 10@xmath33 ; beyond 250 kpc almost all of the dwarf galaxies have substantial  envelopes in excess of 10@xmath33 , regardless of whether the galaxies are dsph or dirr . inside the 250 kpc cutoff most of the upper limits and the three detections are in fact below 10@xmath34 .",
    "the one exception is and v which is the galaxy most likely to be a chance superposition ( see  3.1.2 ) .",
    "antlia and phoenix are the exceptions beyond the 250 kpc cutoff .",
    "antlia may be anomalous because of its close proximity to ngc 3109 .",
    "the  mass of phoenix may be underestimated since its mass is determined from an interferometric measurement confused by bright foreground emission at the same velocity .",
    "it is also possible that another more massive  component is actually associated with the galaxy (  4.1.7 ) .    to check whether the effect seen in figure 4a might be a distance effect related to the malmquist bias , we replotted the figure by normalizing to the visual luminosity of each galaxy , l@xmath35 , taken from mateo ( 1998 ) ; the results are shown in figure 4b .",
    "evidence for the 250 kpc  cutoff remains quite strong in this plot .",
    "van den bergh ( 1999a ) noted that the dsph galaxies tend to be closer to m31 and the milky way than the dirr galaxies , but because some of the galaxies beyond the 250 kpc  cutoff are dsphs , the segregation in  properties is not simply a function of morphological type .",
    "the sharp cutoff implies that some process strips the galaxies with perigalacticons @xmath36 250 kpc of their , a suggestion first made by einasto et al .",

    "if the sharp boundary at 250 kpc is due to ram - pressure stripping by hot halo gas ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , one can estimate the density of the ambient gas responsible for the stripping , @xmath37 , from @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the the stellar and gas surface densities respectively in the dwarf galaxy , @xmath41 is the velocity of the galaxy through the hot halo gas , and @xmath5 is a constant near unity that depends on whether the galaxy is a flattened or a spheroidal system , and on the functional form of the gravitational potential . for a uniform spherical stellar system with an extended uniform density halo , @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 in this case are the peak values measured at the center of the galaxy .",
    "the inequality exists because the gas may be clumped and the surface filling fraction of the  may be less than unity , raising the local value of @xmath40 above its beam averaged value . if the gravitational mass of the galaxy , m@xmath43 , is given by @xmath44 , then we may rewrite equation 1 as : @xmath45 in terms of observables , equation 2 may be rewritten as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number density of the hot halo gas , @xmath48 is the peak brightness temperature of the , and @xmath11 is the measured full width at half maximum of the  line .",
    "we use this equation to estimate @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath41 we take the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of 60  for the local group dwarf galaxies ( van den bergh 1999a ) . for @xmath11",
    ", we take the mean value for the galaxies from table 1 of 25 . for @xmath49 ,",
    "we take it equal to @xmath50 , the radius to which gas is observed in a dwarf galaxy ; it ranges from about 1 - 10 kpc for all of the galaxies in the sample with the larger values all outside the 250 kpc cutoff radius . inside the cutoff radius ,",
    "three galaxies , and iii , sculptor and sextans , still have associated , and we take @xmath51 kpc , the largest of the radii to which gas is observed . thus @xmath52 .",
    "interestingly , this value is close to the value of @xmath53  derived by moore & davis ( 1994 ) for ram - pressure stripping of the magellanic clouds .",
    "their value applies to the density of a hot halo at a distance of 65 kpc from the galactic center , whereas ours is an average over a volume of 250 kpc radius .",
    "if the hot gas is in virial equilibrium and the mass of the mw is 1  @xmath54 , the hot gas temperature is @xmath0 1  @xmath55 k , and the thermal pressure @xmath56 = 23 - 34 k .",
    "the total mass of the hot halo at the derived @xmath47 is about @xmath2  to 250 kpc .",
    "gas will be stripped from the galaxy if the column density of hot gas is equal to the column density in the galaxy .",
    "thus for galaxies ( or hvcs ) with n ( ) @xmath57 250 kpc = @xmath58 2 , the gas can remain in the galaxy until it collides with the mw .",
    "the most recent map of sculptor by carignan ( 1999 ) shows  contours ranging from 0.15 - @xmath59 2 , but with a broad emission plateau of about @xmath60 2 , somewhat below the ram - pressure limit .",
    "the discrepancy , while not large , may be due to clumping ( implying higher mean column densities within the beam ) , a somewhat high estimate for @xmath47 , sextans not having traversed a full 250 kpc in its orbit through the hot halo , or some combination of the three .",
    "the radial velocity of sculptor relative to the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) is 75 , close to the value of 60  assumed .",
    "gas will be tidally stripped from a galaxy if @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the distance from the mw or m31 to the galaxy , and @xmath63 is the circular speed of the mw or m31 at the distance of the dwarf galaxy . at a distance of 250 kpc ,",
    "@xmath63 = 130  ( appropriate for an enclosed mw mass of @xmath64 ) ; the tidal radius of a dwarf galaxy with a total mass of @xmath65  is about 11.5 kpc , greater than the largest radius to which is detected in any local group dwarf .",
    "thus for these parameters , the gas is tidally stable . for dwarf galaxies at 80 kpc from the mw ,",
    "the distance of sculptor and sextans , the tidal radius is about 4 kpc , comfortably larger than the 1.5  2 kpc to which  is detected in either sculptor or sextans .",
    "thus , the gas in these galaxies is tidally stable at their current distance , but if their perigalacticon is significantly smaller , then even the present day observed gas could be tidally stripped from these galaxies . thus tidal stripping can be important in removing the outer  envelopes of the dsph galaxies within 250 kpc of the mw and m31 .",
    "nevertheless , most of the dsphs within 250 kpc are devoid of  to the current limits of detectability .",
    "while galactic tides can be important in stripping the outermost  layers of local group dsphs , it is difficult to understand how tidal stripping can completely rid a dsph of its atomic gas .",
    "it is instructive to compare the effect of tidal vs. ram - pressure stripping in a dwarf galaxy at a radius of 10 kpc and located at a distance of 250 kpc from the mw .",
    "the tidal acceleration from equation 4 above is @xmath66 .",
    "the acceleration of a parcel of gas due to ram - pressure is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mean mass per nucleon of the atomic gas . for @xmath69 , @xmath47 = @xmath70 , and n ( ) = @xmath71 2 , a typical value in the outskirts of leo i and lgs 3 , the ratio of the ram - pressure acceleration to the tidal acceleration is about 18 .",
    "tidal stripping becomes relatively more important , however , as one gets closer to the center of the local group giant spirals , but if there is even one tenth the density of hot gas around the mw and m31 , as we derive above , ram - pressure stripping will be relatively more important than tidal stripping unless perigalacticon is very small .",
    "we therefore conclude that although tidal stripping may play a role in the gas depletion of the dwarf galaxies in the local group , tidal stripping alone can not explain the near total absence of atomic gas in most of the dsphs within 250 kpc of either the mw or m31 .",
    "ram - pressure stripping is much more efficient over most of the parameter space permitted by the  observations , and implies that the mw and m31 have hot halos with radii of @xmath0250 kpc , beyond which stripping is ineffective .",
    "it is quite reasonable that the mw and m31 have hot halos in the context of the blitz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) picture of the formation of the milky way and m31 from the accretion of hvcs .",
    "the dynamical model presented by these authors is quite simple and does not include collisions between hvcs which are expected close to either galaxy or in the region between the galaxies .",
    "such collisions are , however , expected ; the typical center - of - mass collision velocity is about 100  at the present epoch , high enough to completely ionize the colliding clouds and to raise their temperatures to @xmath72 k ( mckee & hollenbach 1980 ) . collisions between clouds at the present epoch are , however , expected to be rare , but should have been more frequent in the early universe ( see fig .  16 in blitz",
    "et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the typical cloud collision velocity at those times would have been higher , leading to hot gas temperatures which can reach the virial values .",
    "the cooling time of the hot halo gas at the present epoch is @xmath73 yr at an inferred mean density of @xmath70 .",
    "thus the hot halo gas is stable for more than a hubble time , but the inner parts can cool and condense in a shorter time if the density distribution is isothermal .",
    "whether hvc collisions are frequent enough to produce a hot halo can be tested by direct numerical simulations .",
    "the halos around each galaxy need not be separate entities and may be connected along the line between the two galaxies .",
    "the existence of a hot halo is consistent with the destruction of @xmath01000 objects with  content of @xmath74 , close to the typical mass derived by blitz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the hvcs .",
    "it is worth noting that klypin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown that simulations of hierarchical structure formation seem to require about 1000 dwarf galaxies to have formed in the local group , one and a half orders of magnitude more than have currently been identified .",
    "klypin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that the required number of dwarfs might be consistent with the inferred population of hvcs , but it is also possible that the gaseous halo is from a population of true dwarf galaxies with a typical  content similar to that found in the present - day dwarfs that have been destroyed by collisions .",
    "a mass of @xmath75  of hot gas would be provided by about @xmath76 dwarf galaxies , with typical  masses between @xmath77 , the range of  masses in present - day dwarfs not yet stripped of .",
    "the mean free path for collisions between hvcs ought to be smaller than that for dwarfs because of their larger diameters , and the difference between the two cases might be testable by simulations .",
    "one of the more difficult of the  observations to understand is that of lgs 3 , and to a lesser extent , leo i. lgs 3 has an  cloud clearly associated with it , but the  cloud differs in velocity from the galaxy by 50 .",
    "the observations of this galaxy by young & lo ( 1997 ) show a well - defined  component centered on the galaxy with a velocity essentially identical to the systemic velocity of the stars .",
    "the extent of the gas centered on the galaxy is only about 5compared to the extent of about 15 in figure 1 . with a velocity difference of 50",
    ", the gas shown in figure 1 can not be gravitationally bound to lgs 3 , which suggests a chance superposition . on the other hand , the probability of a chance spatial superposition is about 1% , and the probability that the velocity would be so close to the systemic velocity is about 0.2 , for a joint probability of about @xmath78 .",
    "the situation with leo i is similar but less extreme .",
    "the right hand panel of figure 3 shows that  at the velocity of the galaxy is closely associated with it , even though no  is detected toward the stars themselves .",
    "nevertheless , the velocity centroid of the emission shown in the right hand panel of figure 3 differs from the systemic velocity of the galaxy by about 30 . in this case , however , the gas shown in both panels is part of the same velocity component . while the extended emission shown in figure 3 is unlikely to be gravitationally bound to leo i , it is more difficult to argue that this gas is also a chance superposition , not only because the lower velocity gas is part of the same velocity component , but also because the joint probability of having two galaxies in this small sample with two  clouds in the same line of sight at velocities close to the systemic velocity is @xmath36 10@xmath79 .",
    "we note , however , that both galaxies are close to the 250 kpc boundary shown in figure 4 .",
    "leo i is 250 kpc from the milky way ( mateo 1998 ) and lgs 3 is 270 kpc from the center of m31 .",
    "could it be that the  seen in figure 1 for each galaxy is beginning to be stripped by the ram - pressure of the hot halo gas ?",
    "certainly for lgs 3 , the gas in figure 1 looks as if it has been swept away from the galaxy itself .",
    "tidal stripping is not an option for either galaxy because there is a systematic offset in velocity in only one sense ; tidal stripping would produce plumes with velocities both larger and smaller than the systemic velocity of the dsph . from equation 5 , we find that the mean acceleration of the gas due to tidal stripping is @xmath80 cm s@xmath23 .",
    "gas is detected as much as 15 from lgs 3 , or about 20 kpc in projection from the galaxy . with a velocity difference of 50",
    ", gas farthest from the galaxy will have taken @xmath81 yr to reach that distance .",
    "assuming that the acceleration is constant , ram - pressure stripped gas would attain a velocity of @xmath015  in that time .",
    "this is a bit on the low side , but the agreement is not unreasonable , given the uncertainty with which the critical parameters are known .",
    "the density of the hot gas might be somewhat higher , as might the velocity of the galaxy with respect to the hot halo gas , and projection effects can be important at the 50% level .",
    "if the position and velocity offsets of the  from lgs 3 are due to ram - pressure stripping , one would expect there to be a velocity gradient in the sense that the most extreme differences in velocity are seen farthest from the galaxy .",
    "the individual  spectra that compose figure 1 do not , however , show any detectable gradient in the extended cloud .",
    "ram - pressure stripping should produce velocity differences from the systemic velocity with well - determined signs : the velocity of the stripped gas should always be closer to the systemic velocity of either the mw or m31 than that of the dwarf being stripped . in the case of leo i",
    ", the galaxy has a gsr velocity of + 178 ; the anomalous velocity gas has a gsr velocity of + 158 , in accord with expectations . for lgs 3 ,",
    "the velocity relative to the gsr is about 25  more negative than that of m31 , suggesting that the stripped gas should have a more positive velocity .",
    "but this is not the case ; the stripped gas is 50  more negative .",
    "this discrepancy is difficult to reconcile with ram - pressure stripping .",
    "we conclude that ram - pressure stripping can plausibly produce the magnitude of the velocity and positional offsets for lgs 3 and leo i if the velocity of the galaxy relative to the hot gas and the density of the hot gas are within factors of two and three respectively of the values assumed for them .",
    "the sign of the velocity offset for lgs 3 , however , seems inconsistent with ram - pressure stripping .      in their paper on hvcs ,",
    "blitz et al .  ( 1999 ) derived properties of hvcs under the assumption that they are typically at a distance of 1 mpc ; however they did not correct for beam smearing , which would lower both the diameters and the derived masses .",
    "furthermore , if the typical hvc has a distance more like that of m31 than the 1 mpc assumed , their derived masses may be too high by as much as a factor of 4 , and their diameters too high by a factor of 2 .",
    "a complete northern hemisphere hvc catalogue by robishaw & blitz ( in preparation ) will correct for beam smearing .",
    "given this range of uncertainty , typical hvc  masses are about 5 - @xmath82  if the hvcs are extragalactic and typical diameters are about 15 - 28 kpc .",
    "some of the dwarf galaxy  envelopes are just in this range , notably ddo 210 , leo i , lgs 3 , ic 10 , leo a , sextans a , and possibly and v. several others are confused with the velocities from galactic foreground emission , and although their masses are in the correct range , the full extent of their  emission is poorly determined .",
    "thus , numerous local group dwarfs have  properties virtually indistinguishable from extragalactic hvcs , and as pointed out in  4 , two previously catalogued hvcs are apparently associated with galaxies .",
    "this suggests that some of the hvcs might harbor undetected low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , and searches are currently underway to detect galaxies toward the hvcs .",
    "if successful , this would bridge the gap between the non - detections of hvc analogues without stars in deep extragalactic  searches ( zwaan et al .  1997 ; spitzak & schneider 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the extragalactic  searches have sensitivities that trail off just at or above the derived typical hvc mass , especially if the masses derived by robishaw & blitz ( in preparation ) turn out to be lower , as expected .",
    "so there may nevertheless be a substantial population of low - mass intergalactic  clouds without associated stars . in either case",
    ", the hvcs might then turn out to be the missing dwarf galaxies in the simulations of klypin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "mateo ( 1998 ) , grebel ( 1999 ) and van den bergh ( 1999b ) discuss several problems associated with the apparent lack of interstellar gas in the dsph galaxies , most notably , their complex star formation histories .",
    "some galaxies seem to have had several episodes of star formation , including some as recently as 1  2 gyr ago ( grebel 1999 ) , but this hardly seems possible without at least some traces of gas that could have fueled this activity .",
    "the observations presented in this paper suggest that one way around this problem is that _ all _ of the local group dwarf galaxies have had loosely bound  envelopes such as those seen for the galaxies at distances beyond the 250 kpc cutoff radius when the last episode of star formation took place .",
    "this loosely bound gas would be subject to small relatively localized perturbations that could lead either to star formation or gas disruption and may be why the star formation histories of the local group dwarfs are so heterogeneous ( mateo 1998 ; grebel 1999 ) .",
    "dissipation in the gas might have generated both low levels of ongoing star formation as well as occasional large bursts until the orbits of the galaxies brought them within the hot halos around the mw and m31 .",
    "star formation would then have ended for the galaxies with  column densities insufficient to withstand the ram - pressure stripping . clearly , the extended  envelope around leo i is plausibly the source of the relatively recent star formation activity in that galaxy ( e.g.  grebel 1998 ) .",
    "it is perhaps only when the galaxies venture within a radius of 250 kpc that the dwarfs become stripped of their , eventually losing their ability to form stars .",
    "the dynamical simulations of hvcs in the context of the evolution of the local group ( blitz et al .",
    "1999 ) suggest that at least some of the dwarf galaxies inside the 250 kpc cutoff may be approaching the mw and m31 for the first time . to traverse the entire length of the hot halo for galaxies at a velocity of 60  appropriate for the local group dwarfs ( van den bergh 1999a ) takes @xmath83 yr , a substantial fraction of a hubble time .",
    "thus some of the dwarfs such as carina may only recently have lost their gas , while others such as ursa minor , that show no evidence of recent star formation activity , may have orbits that kept them within the cutoff distance for most of a hubble time .",
    "if the connection between lsb dsph galaxies and the hvcs can be confirmed , it might also solve the metallicity problem for hvcs .",
    "that is , if the hvcs are extragalactic , they must have existed for a hubble time , but the abundances and metallicities , while low , are not primordial ( wakker & van woerden 1997 ; wakker et al .",
    "how then did these hvcs get their metals ?",
    "if the hvcs are associated with low levels of star formation as in the dsph galaxies , then the stars themselves could have contaminated the gas . with a range of [ fe / h ] @xmath84 -1 to -2 dex for the stars in dwarf galaxies , one expects the gas to reflect these values .",
    "the best determined metallicity toward an hvc ( complex c ) is the measurement of s / h = 0.09 times the solar value ( wakker et al .  1999 ) , as expected , but more measurements are needed .",
    "we have shown that there is good evidence that nearly half of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group contain large quantities of gas in an extended distribution around each galaxy .",
    "even without measured velocities for most of the galaxies , the associations of the gas with the galaxies must be real because the number of positional coincidences is more than two orders of magnitude greater than would be expected from random placements of both the galaxies and the hvcs .",
    "the properties of the  associated with many of the dwarfs are similar to those expected for extragalactic hvcs , suggesting that the hvcs may harbor lsb galaxies similar to the dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "we have investigated the reason for the great diversity in the neutral gas content of local group dwarf galaxies , and have shown that within 250 kpc of the center of both the mw and m31 , the gas content drops precipitously . both tidal and ram - pressure stripping can play a role in removing the gas , but ram - pressure stripping is more effective and can strip a galaxy completely . the inferred mean density of hot gas is @xmath6 .",
    "two of the local group dwarfs , lgs 3 and leo i , have  envelopes that differ from the systemic velocities by 50  and 30 respectively .",
    "the joint probability that both galaxies have unrelated clouds along the line of sight is @xmath85 10@xmath79 .",
    "ram - pressure stripping could cause large velocity offsets , and in the case of leo i , the inferred hot halo properties are in reasonable quantitative agreement with what is observed . for lgs 3 , the agreement is less good , but may still be within the range of acceptability .",
    "we find that the  observations can explain qualitatively the diversity in the star formation histories of the local group dwarfs , both the presence and absence of recent star formation in individual dsphs .",
