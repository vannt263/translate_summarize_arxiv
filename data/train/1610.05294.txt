    "the theory of linear cocycles is a classical and rather developed field of dynamical systems and ergodic theory , whose origins go back to the works of furstenberg , kesten  @xcite , furstenberg  @xcite and oseledets  @xcite .",
    "the simplest examples are the derivative transformations of smooth dynamical systems but the notion of linear cocycle is a lot more general and flexible , and arises naturally in many other situations , e.g. , the spectral theory of schrdinger operators .    among the outstanding issues is the problem of simplicity : _",
    "when is it the case that the dimension of all oseledets subspaces is equal to 1 ? _ this was first studied by furstenberg  @xcite , guivarch - raugi  @xcite and goldsheid - margulis  @xcite , who obtained explicit simplicity criteria for random i.i.d .",
    "products of matrices .",
    "bonatti - viana  @xcite and avila - viana  @xcite have much extended the theory , to include a much broader class of ( hlder continuous ) cocycles over hyperbolic maps .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to initiate the study of simplicity in the context of linear cocycles over partially hyperbolic maps .",
    "the study of partially hyperbolic systems was introduced in the works of brin - pesin  @xcite and hirsch - pugh - shub  @xcite and has been at the heart of much recent progress in this area . while sharing many of the important features of uniformly hyperbolic systems , partially hyperbolic maps are a lot more flexible and encompass many new interesting phenomena .    as we are going to see",
    ", the study of linear cocycles over partially hyperbolic maps introduces a host of new issues .",
    "we will deal with these issues in the context when the partially hyperbolic map is a partially hyperbolic skew - product @xmath1 ( this and other notions mentioned in what follows are defined precisely in section  [ s.definitions ] ) .",
    "the case when the map is non - uniformly hyperbolic , that is , when all center lyapunov exponents are non - zero , is better understood .",
    "indeed , the case of @xmath2-dimensional cocycles is covered by viana  @xcite and for general @xmath3 it should be possible to combine a symbolic description as in sarig  @xcite with the main result of avila , viana  @xcite , that deals with cocycles over countable shifts .",
    "for this reason , we focus on the opposite case : namely , we take the skew - product to be mostly neutral along the center direction , meaning that its iterates have bounded derivatives along the verticals @xmath4 .    concerning the linear cocycle , we take it to admit strong - stable and strong - unstable holonomies , in the sense of bonatti - gomez - mont - viana  @xcite and avila - santamaria - viana  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity conditions in our main result , that we are going to state next , may be viewed as extensions of the pinching and twisting conditions in bonatti - viana  @xcite and avila - viana @xcite to the present partially hyperbolic setting .",
    "firstly , we call the linear cocycle _ uniformly pinching _ if there exists some fixed ( or periodic ) vertical leaf @xmath5 such that the restriction to @xmath6 of every exterior power of the cocycle admits an invariant dominated decomposition @xmath7 into @xmath8-dimensional subbundles . in particular , this decomposition is continuous and the lyapunov exponents along the factor subbundles @xmath9 are all distinct .",
    "secondly , we say that the linear cocycle is _ uniformly twisting _",
    "if , for any @xmath10-path @xmath11 connecting points @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the push - forward of the decomposition @xmath14 at @xmath15 under the concatenation of strong - stable and strong - unstable holonomies over @xmath11 is in general position with respect to the decomposition @xmath16 at @xmath17 . by the latter , we mean that the image of any sum of @xmath18 subspaces @xmath19 is transverse to the sum of any @xmath20 subspaces @xmath21 , for any @xmath22 .",
    "we say that the linear cocycle is _ uniformly simple _ if it is both uniformly pinching and uniformly twisting .    [ teo.a ]",
    "every uniformly simple linear cocycle over a partially hyperbolic skew - product with mostly neutral center direction has simple lyapunov spectrum relative to any invariant probability measure with local partial product structure .",
    "the notion of local partial product structure will be recalled in section  [ s.definitions ] , where we will also give a more precise version of the theorem .",
    "indeed , as we will see , the conclusion holds under weaker ( non - uniform ) versions of the pinching and twisting conditions .",
    "moreover , already in the form given in theorem  [ teo.a ] , our simplicity criterion holds for a subset of hlder continuous cocycles with non - empty interior .",
    "we will also discuss the issue of density of this subset in section  [ s.definitions ] .",
    "* acknowledgements .",
    "* we are grateful to l. backes , f. lenarduzzi , e. pujals and j. yang for numerous discussions .",
    "now let us give the precise definitions of the notions involved , as well as a refined version of theorem  [ teo.a ] .",
    "the _ linear cocycle _ defined by a measurable matrix - valued function @xmath23 over an invertible measurable map @xmath24 is the ( invertible ) map @xmath25 given by @xmath26 its iterates are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28    let @xmath29 be an @xmath30-invariant probability measure on @xmath31 such that @xmath32 are integrable . by oseledets",
    "@xcite , at @xmath29-almost every point @xmath33 there exist real numbers @xmath34 and a decomposition @xmath35 into vector subspaces such that @xmath36 for every non - zero @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath39 is called the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath40 .    in this work",
    "we assume that the invariant measure @xmath29 is ergodic",
    ". then the lyapunov exponents and the dimensions of the subspaces @xmath39 are constant almost everywhere .",
    "the _ lyapunov spectrum _ of the cocycle is the set of all lyapunov exponents .",
    "the following notion is central to the whole paper : the lyapunov spectrum is _ simple _ if it contains exactly @xmath41 distinct lyapunov exponents or , equivalently , if every lyapunov exponent has multiplicity equal to @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath42 be any two - sided finite or countable shift .",
    "by this we mean that @xmath43 is the set of two - sided sequences @xmath44 in some set @xmath45 with @xmath46 , and the map @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 let @xmath49 be the distance defined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 then @xmath43 is a metric space .",
    "moreover , @xmath47 is a _ hyperbolic homeomorphism _ ( in the sense of @xcite ) , as we are going to explain .    given any @xmath54",
    ", we define the _ local stable _ and _ unstable sets _ of @xmath55 with respect to @xmath47 by @xmath56 observe that , taking @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,    * @xmath59 for any @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; * @xmath63 for any @xmath60 , @xmath64 and @xmath62 ; * if @xmath65 , then @xmath66 and @xmath67 intersect in a unique point , which is denoted by @xmath68 $ ] and depends continuously on @xmath55 and @xmath69 .    by _ partially hyperbolic skew - product _ over the shift map @xmath47 we mean a homeomorphism @xmath70 of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a compact riemann manifold and the maps @xmath73 are diffeomorphisms satisfying @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a constant as in ( i ) - ( ii ) .",
    "we also assume the following hlder condition : there exist @xmath76 and @xmath77 such that the @xmath78-distance between @xmath79 and @xmath80 is bounded by @xmath81 for every @xmath82 .",
    "we say that @xmath30 has _ mostly neutral center direction _ if the family of maps @xmath83 defined for @xmath84 and @xmath54 by @xmath85 have bounded derivatives , that is , if there exists @xmath76 such that @xmath86    [ r.equicontinuity ] clearly , this implies that the @xmath87 is equi - continuous .",
    "when the maps @xmath80 are @xmath88 , equi - continuity alone suffices for all our purposes ( see remark  [ equicontinuitysuffices ] ) .",
    "a few comments are in order concerning the scope of the notion of partially hyperbolic skew - product . to begin with ,",
    "the shift @xmath89 may be replaced by a sub - shift @xmath90 associated to a transition matrix @xmath91 . by this",
    "we mean that @xmath92 for every @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the restriction of the shift map @xmath47 to the subset @xmath95 of sequences @xmath44 such that @xmath96 for every @xmath97 .",
    "one way to reduce the sub - shift case to the full shift case is through inducing .",
    "namely , fix any @xmath8-cylinder @xmath98=\\{(x_n)_{n\\in\\integer}\\in\\hsigma_t : x_0 = i\\}$ ] with positive measure and consider the first return map @xmath99 \\to [ i]$ ] of @xmath94 to @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "this is conjugate to a full countable shift ( with the return times as symbols ) and it preserves the normalized restriction to the cylinder of the @xmath94-invariant measure .",
    "all the conditions that follow are not affected by this procedure . moreover ,",
    "every linear cocycle @xmath101 over @xmath94 gives rise , also through inducing , to a linear cocycle over @xmath102 whose lyapunov spectrum is just a rescaling of the lyapunov spectrum of @xmath101 . in particular , simplicity may also be read out from the induced cocycle .",
    "moreover , although we choose to formulate our approach in a symbolic set - up , for skew - products over shifts , it is clear that it extends to other situations that are more geometric in nature .",
    "for example , take @xmath103 to be a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on a compact @xmath104-dimensional manifold @xmath105 and assume that there exists an embedded closed curve @xmath106 such that @xmath107 and some connected component of @xmath108 is a closed curve .",
    "by @xcite , @xmath102 is conjugate up to finite covering to a skew - product over a linear anosov diffeomorphism of the 2-torus .",
    "thus , using a markov partition for the anosov map , one can semi - conjugate @xmath102 to a partially hyperbolic skew - product over a sub - shift of finite type . in this way",
    ", the conclusions of this paper can be adapted to linear cocycles over such a diffeomorphism .",
    "property is a condition of _ domination _ ( or _ normal hyperbolicity _ , in the spirit of  @xcite ) : it means that any expansion and contraction of @xmath79 along the fibers @xmath4 are dominated by the hyperbolicity of the base map @xmath47 . for our purposes ,",
    "its main relevance is that it ensures the existence of strong - stable and strong - unstable `` foliations '' for @xmath30 , as we explain next .",
    "let the product @xmath109 be endowed with the distance defined by @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the distance on @xmath43 and @xmath112 is the distance induced by the riemannian metric on @xmath72 .",
    "we consider the _",
    "stable holonomies _",
    "@xmath113 defined for every @xmath55 and @xmath69 with @xmath114 , and",
    "_ unstable holonomies _",
    "@xmath115 defined for every @xmath55 and @xmath69 with @xmath116 .",
    "that these families of maps exist follows from the assumption , using arguments from @xcite ; see for instance @xcite which deals with a similar setting .",
    "we define the _ local strong - stable set _ and the _ local strong - unstable set _ of each @xmath117 to be @xmath118 respectively .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath119 and analogously on strong - unstable sets for time @xmath120 .      throughout ,",
    "we take @xmath29 to be an @xmath30-invariant measure with _ partial product structure _ , that is , a probability measure of the form @xmath121 where :    * @xmath122 is a continuous function bounded from zero and infinity ; * @xmath123 is a probability measure supported on @xmath124 ; * @xmath125 is a probability measure supported on @xmath126 ; * @xmath127 is a probability measure on the manifold @xmath72 .    for notational convenience ,",
    "we write the boundedness as follows : there exists @xmath128 such that @xmath129 for every @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is defined by @xmath135 observe that when @xmath43 is a finite shift space this is an immediate consequence of compactness and the continuity of @xmath136 .",
    "now define , for @xmath137 , @xmath138 in other words , @xmath139 is the normalization of @xmath140 .",
    "note that the family @xmath141 is a ( continuous ) disintegration of @xmath29 along vertical fibers , that is , with respect to the partition @xmath142 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath29 is invariant under @xmath30 , together with the fact that @xmath143 depends continuously on @xmath55 , implies that @xmath144 we will also see in section  [ s.ustates ] that this disintegration is _ holonomy invariant _ : @xmath145    [ r.homoclinic ] in particular , if @xmath146 is a fixed point of the shift map then @xmath147 is invariant under @xmath148 . clearly , it is equivalent to @xmath149 .",

    "now let @xmath204 be the @xmath205-matrix defined by @xmath206 we call the cocycle @xmath190 _ twisting _ if , some choice of the homoclinic point @xmath150 , all the algebraic minors @xmath207 of @xmath208 decay sub - exponentially along the orbits of @xmath148 , meaning that @xmath209 and every @xmath210 with @xmath211 .",
    "it is clear that this holds if @xmath190 is uniformly twisting , because in this case the algebraic minors are uniformly bounded .",
    "more generally ( see for instance  ( * ? ? ?",

    "we say that the cocycle @xmath190 is _ simple _ if it is both pinching and twisting , in the sense of the previous section . that is the case , in particular , if @xmath190 is uniformly pinching and uniformly twisting .",
    "thus theorem  [ teo.a ] is contained in the following result :    [ teo.b ] if @xmath213 is a simple cocycle then its lyapunov spectrum is simple .",

    "thus theorem  [ teo.a ] implies    [ teo.c ] there is a non - empty open subset of @xmath217 such that the associated linear cocycle @xmath190 over @xmath30 has simple lyapunov spectrum .    in many contexts of linear cocycles over _ hyperbolic _",
    "systems , simplicity turns out to be a generic condition : it contains an open and dense subset of cocycles ( precise statements can be found in viana  @xcite ) .",
    "this is related to the fact that , in the hyperbolic setting , the pinching and twisting conditions are just transversality conditions , they clearly hold on the complement of suitable submanifolds with positive codimension . at present",
    ", it is unclear how this can be extended to the partially hyperbolic setting .",
    "uniform pinching is surely not a generic condition , in general , but it might be locally generic in some special situations , for instance when @xmath148 is quasi - periodic .",
    "we close this section by outlining the overall strategy of the proof of theorem  [ teo.b ] . for every @xmath218",
    ", we want to find complementary @xmath219invariant measurable sections @xmath220 such that the lyapunov exponents of @xmath190 along @xmath221 are strictly larger than those along @xmath222 .",
    "the starting point is to reduce the problem to the case when the maps @xmath79 and the matrices @xmath223 depend on @xmath55 only through its positive part @xmath132 .",
    "this we do in section  [ s.martingale2 ] , using the stable holonomies to conjugate the original dynamics to others with these properties . then @xmath157 projects to a transformation @xmath224 on @xmath225 which is a skew - product over the one - sided shift @xmath226 and , similarly , the linear cocycle @xmath227 projects to a linear cocycle @xmath228 over the transformation @xmath30 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath190 and @xmath101 the actions @xmath229 induced by the two linear cocycles on the grassmannian bundles . still in section  [ s.martingale2 ] , using very classical arguments , we relate the invariant measures of @xmath30 and @xmath190 with those of @xmath230 and @xmath101 , respectively .",

    "@xmath0-states _ , that is @xmath190-invariant probability measures @xmath231 whose rokhling disintegrations @xmath232 are invariant under unstable holonomies , as well as the corresponding @xmath101-invariant probability measures @xmath233 . here",
    "we meet the first important new difficulty arising from the fact that @xmath30 is only partially hyperbolic .",
    "indeed , in the hyperbolic setting such measures @xmath233 are known to admit _ continuous _ disintegrations @xmath234 along the fibers @xmath235 and this fact plays a key part in the arguments of bonatti - viana  @xcite and avila - viana  @xcite .    in the partially hyperbolic setting ,",
    "the situation is far more subtle : the disintegration @xmath236 along the sets @xmath237 is still continuous , but there is no reason why this should extend to the disintegration @xmath238 along fibers @xmath239 , which is what one really needs . the way we make up for this is by proving a kind of @xmath240-continuity : if @xmath241 in @xmath242 then @xmath243 in @xmath244 .",
    "see proposition  [ p.l1 ] for the precise statement .",
    "this also leads to our formulating the arguments in terms of measurable sections @xmath245 of the grassmannian bundle , which is perhaps another significant novelty in this paper .",
    "the properties of such sections are studied in section  [ s.zeromes ] .",
    "the key result ( proposition  [ p.medidazero ] ) is that , under pinching and twisting , the graph of every invariant grassmannian section has zero @xmath246-measure , for every @xmath247 and any @xmath0-state @xmath231 .",
    "these results build up to section  [ s.dirac ] , where we prove that every @xmath0-state @xmath231 has an atomic disintegration .",
    "more precisely ( theorem  [ t.dirac ] ) , there exists a measurable section @xmath248 such that , given any @xmath0-state @xmath231 on @xmath249 , we have @xmath250 thus we construct the invariant section @xmath248 in .    to find the complementary invariant section @xmath251 , in section  [ s.orthogonal ] we apply the same procedure to the adjoint cocycle @xmath252 , that is , the linear cocycle defined over @xmath253 by the function @xmath254 we check ( proposition  [ p.twist.adj ] ) that this cocycle @xmath252 is pinching and twisting if and only if @xmath190 is .",
    "so , the previous arguments yield a @xmath252-invariant section @xmath255 related to the @xmath0-states of @xmath252 .",
    "then we just take @xmath256 .",
    "finally , in section  [ s.teob ] we check that the eccentricity , or lack of conformality , of the iterates @xmath257 goes to infinity @xmath29-almost everywhere ( see proposition  [ p.infinito ] ) and we use this fact to deduce that every lyapunov exponent of @xmath190 along @xmath221 is strictly larger than any of the lyapunov exponents of @xmath190 along @xmath222 . at this stage",
    "the arguments are again very classical .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem  [ teo.b ] .",
    "theorem  [ teo.c ] is proven in section  [ teoremab ] .",
    "the two appendices contain material that seems to be folklore , but for which we could not find explicit references . in appendix  [ a.densel1 ]",

    "let us start by fixing some terminology , once and for all .",
    "we use @xmath258 to denote the identity transformation in a set @xmath259 .",
    "similarly , @xmath260 will always denote the distance in a metric space @xmath259 .",
    "recall that @xmath261 .",
