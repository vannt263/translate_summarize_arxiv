    "is firmly attached to a support @xcite and extremely strong mode mixing occurs . in the first section of this paper we present evidence , that our sensors are in the weak mode mixing limit and that the simple harmonic oscillator model is therefore appropriate . in the second section",
    "we describe our nested sfm feedback system comprising the tuning fork sensor , a phase - locked loop and a conventional @xmath0-feedback .",
    "we present an analysis of the linear response and the noise of these feedbacks and show how the optimum settings for the feedback parameters can be found .",
    "these optimum parameters are found to be independent of the tip shape and the details of the tip sample interaction .",
    "the advantages of using a feedback with phase - locked loop for the very high @xmath2 tuning fork sensors are discussed and a comparison is made with the phase control mode .",

    "in the case of @xmath21 , in particular when the two prongs are identical , the two eigenmodes are the symmetric ( the @xmath9 oscillate with zero phase difference ) and the antisymmetric ( the @xmath9 oscillate with a phase difference of @xmath22 ) mode .",
    "the metallic tuning fork contacts are arranged such that only the antisymmetric mode is excited by a driving voltage . for @xmath23",
    "the two modes do not mix significantly and the symmetries of the modes are not strongly affected , while for @xmath24 each prong has its own resonance frequency where the other is hardly excited .    in the following",
    "we show that our tuning fork sensors are in the regime of negligible mode mixing , because the introduced asymmetry is small , i.e. @xmath25 .",

    "it seems to be reasonable that the employed sensors are in the limit of small mode mixing .",
    "an additional observation strongly supports this point of view : only very rarely is a second resonance observed in the admittance . since the measured current detects only the antisymmetric component of the oscillation , strong mode mixing would make the second resonance visible .",

    "second , the relative mechanical coupling strength of the two prongs is strong compared to the influence of the added mass and the added spring constant . in this respect",
    "these sensors are completely equivalent to other sensors with one prong firmly attached to the support which act essentially as an extremely stiff piezoelectric cantilever .",
    "in other respects there are important differences : we find quality factors @xmath2 of up to 250000 under the uhv - conditions occuring in our evacuated sample space at a temperature of 300 mk .",

    "this freedom allows us to choose the bandwidth of the pll either relatively high or relatively low in the span between @xmath129 and @xmath219 .",
    "if the pll - bandwidth is chosen to be high , e.g. close to @xmath219 , the pll will be able to track the resonance frequency with the same bandwidth as the @xmath0-feedback and @xmath180 will be constant throughout a scan .",
    "however , if the pll bandwidth is chosen to be low , e.g. closer to @xmath129 , the pll can not track the resonance frequency with the same bandwidth as the @xmath0-feedback and appreciable error signals arise whenever there is a step on the surface .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig49 ] .",
    "the two images in the top row are topographic images of a detail of a hall bar structure with afm - written oxide lines in the bottom right corner . the left ( right ) image was taken with small ( large ) pll - bandwidth at fixed bandwidth of the @xmath0-feedback .",
    "the bottom row shows the corresponding frequency error signal .",
    "it can be seen that with a slow pll , an additional image can be obtained in which the contours of edges appear very sharp . with a fast pll",
    "this contrast disappears completely .",
    "this ` differential ' image of the surface can be very useful since it eliminates sample tilt and amplifies edges of small height nicely .",
    "it becomes clear from the above discussion that the bandwidth of the @xmath0-feedback is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) @xmath220 i.e. , it is independent of the @xmath2-factor of the tuning fork cantilever .",
    "this is not obvious , since high @xmath2 cantilevers have a low @xmath129 and are therefore known to slow down the response .",
    "however , implemented in our nested feedback system the quality factor of the sensor is canceled from the final expression for the bandwidth .",
    "the only impact on the performance stems from the fact that the sensor response can only be described as a low - pass , if changes in frequency @xmath221 typically occurring during a scan are small compared to @xmath222 .",
    "the situation is different with the stiffness @xmath223 of the sensor which directly enters the quantity @xmath200 , i.e. , the slope of the @xmath224 curve at the operating point .",
    "softer sensors will lead to larger values of @xmath200 and thereby increase the bandwidth of the @xmath0-feedback .",
    "similar arguments play a role for the comparison of scanning in the attractive or repulsive part of the @xmath225 curve . in the attractive part typical values of @xmath200 are much smaller than in the repulsive part . therefore the bandwidth tends to be considerably larger for controlling in the repulsive regime .",
    "we briefly want to discuss why the use of the pll is advantageous compared to phase control , where the phase change measured as the @xmath84-output of the lock - in in our case is directly used for the @xmath0-controller without the intermediate pll .    from a similar linear response analysis",
    "as performed in this paper for our nested system one finds that the same bandwidths of the @xmath0-feedback can be achieved with pure phase control .",
    "enhancement of the bandwidth for scanning operation is therefore not the striking argument for the use of the additional pll feedback .",
    "however , there are several reasons , why we use the pll :    1 .",
    "the pll increases the bandwidth of the tuning fork response when the @xmath0-feedback is not yet controlling , e.g. during the approach of the tip .",
    "the pll allows the use of reasonable approach speeds .",
    "the pll increases the dynamic range of the frequency detection .",
    "the y - signal of the lock - in depends linearly on the frequency shift only in a limited range of frequencies around resonance . with high @xmath2 sensors this range can become so narrow ( 100 mhz ) that during tip approach the frequency shift runs out of this range .",
    "the pll avoids this problem by tracking the resonance .",
    "the frequency range that can be used with pll is mainly determined by the vco - settings .",
    "we typically use a range of 2 hz .",
    "3 .   the pll allows to image with an additional adjustable frequency contrast ( see fig .",
    "[ fig49 ] ) .",
    "when one measures @xmath225-curves the pll allows the clear distinction between conservative frequency shifts and dissipative effects @xcite .",
    "in the first part of this paper we have shown that the tuning fork sensors that we use in our cryo - sfm setups can be well modeled by a single - harmonic oscillator despite the symmetry breaking wire that is attached to one tuning fork prong . in the second part of the paper",
    "we have analyzed the linear response of our nested feedback system comprising the interaction sensor , a phase - locked loop and a conventional @xmath0-feedback .",
    "we have demonstrated that the optimum feedback parameters of such a setup can be easily found and that they are independent of the tip shape and of the details of the tip - sample interaction .",
    "we have compared our setup to the conventional phase - control mode and discussed the advantages of the use of the phase - locked loop for high - q cantilevers .",
