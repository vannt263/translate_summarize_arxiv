    "the minimum value of @xmath180 for the discovery ( @xmath222 ) is also below the ua2 limit , which is about 0.08 ( 0.06 ) and 0.14 ( 0.11 ) for bp2 and bp3 , respectively , at @xmath221 gev and assuming the integrated luminosity of 100 ( 300 ) fb@xmath12 .",
    "we have studied the collider phenomenology of the leptophobic @xmath0 boson from an extra @xmath1 gauge symmetry in models with multiple higgs doublet fields under the conditions of ( i ) no mixing with the z boson , ( ii ) no interactions with charged leptons , and ( iii ) no fcnc via the @xmath0 mediations .",
    "we have shown that in the case of @xmath4 , all the @xmath124 charges for quarks have to be the same ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath223 .",
    "this consequence is relaxed in models with @xmath224 .",
    "we have explicitly shown that the three conditions can not be simultaneously met in the case of @xmath6 .",
    "we have discussed the constraint on the @xmath1 gauge coupling constant from currently available data of the ua2 experiment and the cms @xmath225 measurements at the lhc .",
    "the upper limit on the gauge coupling constant is derived for @xmath226 gev from the former and for @xmath227 gev from the latter .",
    "we have studied the @xmath7 processes ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) with the leptonic decays of @xmath3 and @xmath9 at the lhc for the @xmath4 and @xmath228 cases .",
    "we propose that in the case of @xmath4 and @xmath16 less than the @xmath11 threshold , the @xmath10 process serves as the most promising discovery mode or provides the most stringent constraint on the @xmath1 gauge coupling constant , stronger than that from the ua2 experiment , at the collision energy and integrated luminosity of 8 tev and 19.6 fb@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath20 mode is still the best search channel above the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "when @xmath14 , we have considered four benchmark points ( bp1 , bp2 , bp3 and bp4 ) for the @xmath0 couplings with quarks .",
    "the benchmark point bp1 exactly corresponds to the @xmath4 case . in bp2 ,",
    "the couplings are chosen such that the @xmath196 has the largest branching ratio .",
    "it has a slightly stronger constraint on the gauge coupling from the @xmath10 process than that in the @xmath4 case .",
    "we have also found that the benchmark point with purely left - handed couplings ( bp3 ) gives similar values of significances for the @xmath203 and @xmath229 processes in contrast to the others .",
    "this example shows that a careful comparison between the cross sections of @xmath203 and @xmath204 processes will be crucial to reveal the nature of @xmath0 couplings with quarks .",
    "the scenario of bp4 has nonzero @xmath0 couplings only for the right - handed down - type quarks .",
    "this results in null cross section for the @xmath13 process .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath10 cross section approaches that in bp2 because of the larger gauge coupling strength allowed by ua2 .",
    "finally , we have computed the discovery reach of such a @xmath0 boson at the 14-tev lhc in both @xmath4 and @xmath14 cases . for bp1 ,",
    "the expected @xmath230 upper limit on the @xmath0 coupling @xmath180 has been obtained to be about 0.049  ( 0.084 ) for @xmath231 gev assuming the integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath12 .",
    "in addition , the required @xmath0 coupling to reach the @xmath232 discovery has been found to be 0.078 ( 0.13 ) for @xmath231 gev .",
