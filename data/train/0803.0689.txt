    "spectacular advances in bio- and nanotechnology make it possible , not only to measure or observe , but also to manipulate and construct objects at a very small scale . at the same time there is growing interest in techniques which can add functionality . in particular , the development of molecular engines is a theme which has received great attention over the last two decades .",
    "the appearance of fluctuations in small systems has led to new concepts for characterizing or operating such devices , exploiting rather than fighting these very same fluctuations .",
    "these so - called brownian motors @xcite have an additional theoretical interest through their relation with the old issue of maxwell demons and the second law of thermodynamics . in return , this theoretical connection allows to make statements on the efficiency of such engines @xcite or to transform them from engines into mini - refrigerators @xcite .",
    "most of the studies on brownian motors start with an ad hoc separation of systematic and noise terms , based on linear langevin equations .",
    "this approach however offers little insight into the origin of the rectification of random fluctuations . as pointed out by van kampen @xcite ,",
    "the rectification of nonlinear fluctuations can not be addressed starting from the standard langevin description with additive gaussian white noise . in @xcite a theoretical and numerical study of a thermal engine is presented in which rectification arises at the level of nonlinear response .",
    "the analysis therein starts from a microscopic description based on newton s laws of motion .",
    "there is another related distinct feature of the model : the asymmetry of the thermal engine lies in the geometry of the motor itself , in contrast to the asymmetry imposed by the application of an external potential , appearing in the so - called flashing and rocking ratchet models .",
    "the characteristic properties of the engine , such as the friction coefficient , the speed and the diffusion coefficient , are calculated exactly in @xcite and are found to be in excellent agreement with the results from hard disk molecular dynamics .",
    "however , the results are reported in dimensionless units , in part due to the fact that the analysis was , for reasons of simplicity and for comparison with molecular dynamics , limited to the case of two dimensions . in view of the technological interest of motors in bio- and nanotechnology , we report here a full and detailed analysis of the three - dimensional version .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , the model , notations , and working hypothesis are introduced in section [ model ] .",
    "the calculation method , based on the kinetic theory of gases , is presented in section [ kinetictheory ] , with a discussion of the analytical solution following in section [ solution ] .",
    "finally , in section [ results ] we report and discuss the results for the friction coefficient , diffusion coefficient , and drift velocity as a function of shape and present estimates based on physically realistic parameter values .",
    "the model presented in @xcite reproduces in a simplified way the principle ingredients of feynman s ratchet and pawl mechanism @xcite : a temperature difference between two reservoirs and the presence in at least one reservoir of an asymmetric object .     and @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig : model ] gives a schematic picture of the two - reservoir system .",
    "solid objects with no internal degrees of freedom , called ` motor units ' , are located inside the containers .",
    "these objects are coupled rigidly to each other , so that the motor moves as a single entity , with total mass @xmath4 , along a given straight axis , corresponding to its single translational degree of freedom . for simplicity",
    ", we disregard any rotational degree of freedom ( for a detailed discussion of this case , see @xcite ) .    due to collisions with the gas particles ( mass @xmath5 )",
    ", the motor will change its velocity @xmath6 in the course of time @xmath7 .",
    "the statistics of these collisions can be described under the assumption of molecular chaos , which is valid when the gases are in the high knudsen number regime and the containers are large enough to avoid acoustic and other boundary effects . in addition , the shape of the units surfaces must be such that no re - collisions with the motor occur , namely for convex and closed shapes . with these assumptions ,",
    "the precollisional velocities are random and uncorrelated .",
