    "four dimensional field theories have been remarkably successful at describing nature at energies less than several hundred gev .",
    "unfortunately progress at higher energies has been frustrated by a dearth of general theoretical tools that apply to strongly coupled models .",
    "our understanding of field theory comes largely from perturbation theory ( which applies to weakly coupled systems ) and from qcd ( where specific strong dynamics may be compared to experiment ) .",
    "there are many examples where this understanding is inadequate  for example , even the question of chiral symmetry breaking in a qcd - like gauge theory with a large number of flavors is unsettled @xcite",
    ".    recently new tools have appeared in the context of supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "known collectively as `` duality '' , these ideas have produced convincing pictures of the pattern of symmetry breaking in many strongly coupled supersymmetric theories .",
    "the wide variety of low - energy phenomena that appear is remarkable , including dual gauge groups , conformal fixed points , chiral symmetry breaking , _",
    "etc_. these results are obtained without a detailed solution for the dynamics at strong coupling , but rely on symmetries , inspired guesswork , and general properties of supersymmetry .",
    "this shows that general constraints on the low energy properties of strongly coupled field theories are enormously useful , especially when a complete solution is unavailable .",
    "the most powerful general constraint known is the anomaly matching condition introduced by t hooft @xcite .",
    "generally , we may define an anomaly as a residue of the pole in a particular multi - current correlation function . as discussed by t hooft , this number is independent of renormalization scale , and may therefore be computed at short distances , or equally well at long distances : @xmath1 as the residue of a pole , the anomaly only receives contributions from physical massless degrees of freedom .",
    "if the short distance theory is weakly coupled ( like an asymptotically free gauge theory ) or calculable by other means , the anomaly condition provides an immediate relation of the massless spectrum to the short distance physics , constraining the appearance of massless fermions and nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "anomaly matching , as implementation of this condition is often called , has led to useful constraints on the possible low energy realizations of chiral gauge theories @xcite , as well as qcd - like ( vector - like ) gauge theories @xcite .",
    "anomalies have also played a fundamental role in discovering and checking the dualities of supersymmetric gauge theories ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new constraint on the structure of strongly coupled field theories . before stating and discussing this constraint",
    ", we note that , although the anomaly condition does not forbid the appearance of additional ( vector - like ) massless particles , it is usually assumed that the spectrum contains no massless particles that this condition does not require .",
    "that is , if there are relevant operators not forbidden by symmetries that would produce masses , it is ( technically ) unnatural to assume that these operators are absent",
    ". consequently we might say that nature generally abhors massless particles .",
    "in fact when faced with the task of guessing the massless spectrum of a strongly coupled field theory , we are often guided by the idea that the number of massless particles is as small as possible . since the anomaly condition can always be satisfied by a massless spectrum identical to the ultraviolet degrees of freedom , this would disfavor massless composites if the number of such composites is too large .    in elevating this casual notion to a formal principle",
    ", we need precise definitions of the number of degrees of freedom in both the infrared and ultraviolet .",
    "although there are no unique such objects , we will choose to define quantities related to the free energy of the field theory .",
    "we will consider only renormalizable theories , for which the free energy may be rendered finite and cutoff independent by adjusting the vacuum energy to zero , renormalizing a finite set of parameters , and then removing the cutoff ( holding physical quantities and the temperature fixed ) .",
    "for reasons described later , we will consider only asymptotically free theories .    in terms of this properly renormalized free energy per unit volume ,",
    "@xmath2 , ( which is also equal to minus the pressure ) , the quantity that we will use to characterize the number of infrared degrees of freedom is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temperature . for a free field theory ,",
    "@xmath5 is simply the number of massless bosons plus @xmath6 times the number of massless fermions . for an asymptotically free theory , the corresponding expression in the large @xmath4 limit mesaures the ultraviolet degrees of freedom in a similar way : @xmath7",
    "our qualitative discussion above suggests the new constraint @xmath8 . in section 2",
    "we formulate this idea precisely and describe how this inequality ( assuming that it is correct ) leads to restrictions on the physical properties of strongly coupled field theories .",
    "two examples are considered : a supersymmetric @xmath9 gauge theory with @xmath10 flavors , and a non - supersymmetric version of the same theory . in both cases",
    "the inequality will constrain the low energy structure . in section 3",
    "we describe a ( failed ) route to a proof of the inequality .",
    "the line of argument is nevertheless interesting , and leads to a deeper understanding of the inequality and its relation to so - called `` @xmath0-theorems '' @xcite . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss the @xmath4 dependence for the two examples mentioned above . in section 5",
    "we apply the inequality to a variety of strongly coupled field theories .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize and conclude .",
    "our conjectured inequality is @xmath11 these limits are well defined for theories with both uv and ir fixed points .",
    "however the inequality can be violated in the presence of non - trivial uv fixed points , as we show in section 5.2 .",
    "hence our examples will involve asymptotically free gauge theories , and most will be infrared free as well , although the ir degrees of freedom may be different from those in the uv .    in field theories with weakly coupled fixed points the free energy , appearing in the definition of @xmath12 , may be computed perturbatively . to zeroth order in couplings",
    "the low - temperature free energy density in three spatial dimensions is @xmath13 , \\label{doff}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the number of massless ( real ) bosonic fields , and @xmath15 is the number of massless ( two - component ) fermionic fields .",
    "we have neglected the contributions of any massive fields , which vanish exponentially as @xmath16 .",
    "a similar expression applies in the infinite @xmath4 limit , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 including massive as well as massless fields .",
    "these expressions are exact in the case of free fixed points and approximately correct for theories governed by weak fixed points . for specific theories we may include perturbative corrections .",
    "for our first example we consider a susy @xmath9 gauge theory with @xmath10 flavors ( `` quarks '' and `` antiquarks '' ) of massless fermions and associated superpartners .",
    "the theory has a free uv fixed point if the number of flavors is less than @xmath17 times the number of colors , @xmath18 . in this case",

    "remarkably , this inequality gives the bound @xmath26 , corresponding precisely to the boundary of the weak magnetic phase determined by the analysis of seiberg @xcite . at the boundary @xmath27",
    "the inequality is saturated : @xmath28 gauge theory with 3 flavors .",
    "the theory confines and has an infrared - free dual description containing only a `` meson '' superfield , and @xmath29 . ] .",
    "we will show that the inequality continues to hold for @xmath30 in section 5.2 .",
    "for our second example we consider the non - supersymmetric version of the same @xmath9 gauge theory , with @xmath10 massless quarks ( and antiquarks ) .",
    "the theory has a free uv fixed point for @xmath31 .",
    "based on real qcd we expect the @xmath32 chiral symmetries of this theory to be realized in the nambu - goldstone mode  at least for small enough @xmath33 .",
    "if we assume that this is the case , the ir theory consists of @xmath34 nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "the derivative interactions of these particles are irrelevant in the infrared , and consequently this theory is described by a free ir fixed point .    at these free uv and ir",
    "fixed points we may use eq . ( [ doff ] ) to compute @xmath5 and @xmath19 : @xmath35 and our inequality becomes @xmath36 or , since @xmath10 must be positive @xmath37 since @xmath38 must be 2 or larger , and @xmath10 and @xmath38 must both be integral , this is equivalent to @xmath39 . remarkably , our inequality says that for the number of flavors larger than or equal to four times the number of colors , this gauge theory can not break the full set of chiral symmetries !",
    "this new bound on the onset of the chiral phase transition ( @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) is well above the transitional values suggested by preliminary lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "it is very close , however , to the value that emerges from the use of a continuum gap equation together with the assumption that the coupling is governed by an infrared fixed point appearing in the perturbative @xmath42 function @xcite .",
    "in fact , a combination of the ladder gap equation and the two - loop beta function give a critical value @xmath43 as @xmath44 ) .",
    "the reliability of this result is far from clear , however , since higher order effects are not obviously small .",
    "so whether the chiral phase transition saturates the inequality in this way or takes place at a lower value of @xmath33 remains an open question .",
    "having shown that the inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq ] ) is consistent with other analyses of the susy @xmath9 theory and that it leads to a new result for qcd - like theories , we next discuss why it might be true generally . as an attempt at proof we may define a function @xmath45 at all scales in an obvious way , as minus the free energy density divided by @xmath4 raised to the number of spatial dimensions plus one ( this extension away from 4 space - time dimensions will prove useful shortly ) : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant chosen such that the contribution to @xmath45 from a free bosonic degree of freedom is 1 . the quantities",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath19 are just the limits of this function as @xmath4 approaches zero and @xmath48 respectively .    as a first step we differentiate the function @xmath12 with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "using the standard relations @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the pressure and @xmath52 is the internal energy density , we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ( thermal average of the ) trace of the energy - momentum tensor . for a conformally invariant theory ,",
    "the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is zero . under these circumstances",
    "we see that @xmath12 is a constant , and @xmath5 is equal to @xmath19 .",
    "of course the theories that we are interested in are not conformally invariant  the lack of conformal invariance arises from a scale dependence of coupling constants through renormalization .",
    "consequently we expect the difference between @xmath19 and @xmath5 to arise from the renormalization group flow from the ultraviolet to the infrared .",
    "if @xmath54 is positive along this trajectory , @xmath5 will necessarily be smaller than @xmath19 , proving our inequality .",
    "thus our inequality would follow from a positivity condition on the thermal average of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor ; that is , from positivity of @xmath55 . for non - interacting systems ,",
    "massive modes always have @xmath56 whereas massless modes have @xmath57 . even for interacting classical systems",
    "we expect these conditions to remain valid .",
    "unfortunately the situation in quantum theories is not so simple @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , a classically scale - invariant gauge field theory . in this case the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the trace over gauge indices of the square of the gauge field - strength , as well as over the thermal density matrix , and @xmath42 is the rg beta function .",
    "note that , at least in perturbation theory , the thermal average of the field - strength squared is negative ( magnetic fluctuations are less - well screened than electric fluctuations ) .",
    "therefore a negative beta function leads to a positive @xmath54 , as we desire .",
    "unfortunately this observation immediately suggests examples of _ negative _ @xmath54 . if the low energy theory is a gauge field theory governed by a free infrared fixed point , then the @xmath42 function will be positive at weak coupling where @xmath59 is known to be negative .",
    "this is realized if the low energy theory is either an abelian theory with massless fermions or a non - abelian theory with matter content sufficient to render it infrared free .",
    "the susy @xmath9 theory in the weak magnetic phase , discussed in the previous section , is precisely such an example .",
    "of course this is not a counter - example to our conjectured inequality : the fact that @xmath45 is not monotonic does not contradict the inequality involving @xmath5 and @xmath19 .",
    "( we have already noted that the susy @xmath9 theory in the weak magnetic phase does in fact satisfy the inequality . )",
    "it means , however , that a proof of this inequality will be more involved than the simple argument used here .",
    "this discussion also indicates why we restrict our attention to asymptotically free theories .",
    "negative contributions to @xmath54 decrease @xmath60 ; if these contributions persist over a large temperature range , the inequality will be violated .",
    "since operators in the hamiltonian contribute to @xmath54 according to their scaling dimension , positive operators with a coupling constant of negative mass dimension ( positive `` irrelevant '' operators ) make a _ negative _ contribution to @xmath54 .",
    "a renormalizable theory with a non - trivial uv fixed point may have such an operator which can make a negative contribution to @xmath54 over a large range of temperature , invalidating the inequality .",
    "( an explicit example of this type is mentioned at the end of section 5.2 . )",
    "we thus consider only asymptotically free theories .",
    "note that had the function @xmath45 been monotonic , we would have proven a `` @xmath0-theorem '' : the existence of a function that is monotonic along rg trajectories .",
    "for example , in one spatial dimension the function @xmath45 _ is _ monotonic , since the energy density is always greater than or equal to the pressure in the thermal state .",
    "but the value of this function at any fixed point ( where @xmath61 ) is simply the conventionally defined central charge of the corresponding conformal field theory . ] .",
    "the decrease in central charge between fixed points along an rg trajectory is the @xmath0-theorem of zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "our analysis implies that the existence of a monotonic function of t , equal to @xmath45 at conformal fixed points , would lead to the inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq ] ) .",
    "we have already demonstrated that such a function does not exist in general theories , for dimensions larger than two . even for asymptotically",
    "free theories , if such a function does exist , it is clearly _ not _ @xmath45 itself . we have been unable to find an alternative monotonic function for asymptotically free theories , nor have we been able to establish its impossibility . note that the existence of such a monotonic function , while providing a proof of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq ] ) , is not a necessary condition for the correctness of our much milder inequality .",
    "there have been several attempts to prove a @xmath0-theorem in 4 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the values of these @xmath0-functions at fixed points are numerically quite different from @xmath19 and @xmath5 .",
    "the inequalities similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq ] ) that would arise as consequences of these @xmath0-theorems in general do not significantly constrain the spectrum of 4 dimensional gauge field theories .",
    "the examples of section 2 have already shown that our inequality _ does _ place interesting constraints on the spectrum of 4 dimensional gauge theories .",
    "other examples will be presented in section 5 .",
    "we have stressed that the inequality eq.([eq : ineq ] ) does not require the monotonicity of @xmath45 , and we have noted that for one example in which the inequality is satisfied ( the supersymmetric @xmath9 theory in the weak magnetic phase ) , monotonicity is violated . in this section ,",
    "we examine in more detail the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath45 for this example and for the other example of section two : the non - supersymmetric @xmath9 theory . in each case , we record the @xmath4 dependence for both the @xmath62 and @xmath63 limits , where perturbation theory may be employed .      for @xmath62 , perturbation theory in the underlying",

    "the net difference @xmath134 will be positive if the number of flavors that have expectation values is not too large .      for @xmath135 dimensional qed ( qed@xmath136 ) we will show that the inequality gives an interesting constraint on the allowed infrared phase structure . qed@xmath136 with @xmath92 charged weyl fermions ( @xmath10 dirac fermions ) is believed to have a phase transition as the number of flavors is varied @xcite .",
    "the massless theory has a @xmath137 global symmetry . for large @xmath10",
    ", the screening effect of the fermions prevents the formation of a condensate and the infrared theory is expected to be conformal . for small @xmath10 , on the other hand , one expects global symmetry breaking and dynamical mass generation for the fermions .",
    "an analysis of the breaking using a gap equation indicates that a parity conserving mass term is formed , corresponding to the breaking of the global @xmath137 symmetry to its @xmath138 subgroup .",
    "the inequality places a tight constraint on this pattern of breaking .",
    "qed@xmath136 is free in the ultraviolet and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) we have dimensions free bosons and fermions respectively contribute 1 and @xmath139 to @xmath12 . ]",
    "@xmath140 where @xmath141 counts the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath137 symmetry to @xmath138 leads to @xmath102 nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "since the theory does not confine , the photon remains in the infrared spectrum so we have @xmath142 the inequality is satisfied only for @xmath143 which implies that chiral symmetry breaking is excluded for all @xmath144 .",
    "the critical number of flavors separating the two phases has been estimated , using the gap equation with a @xmath145 expansion of the kernel , to be in the range @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between this result and our inequality suggests that the gap equation over - estimates @xmath147 .",
    "we have proposed a general constraint on the structure of asymptotically free field theories , the inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq ] ) .",
    "although we have not proven this inequality , we have shown that it agrees with a large number of known results .",
    "in addition it places interesting restrictions on the pattern of symmetry breaking in many cases .",
    "the inequality ( or one similar to it ) would arise as a consequence of a @xmath0-theorem in four dimensions , but is a weaker condition , and can be true even in circumstances where a @xmath0-theorem is not .",
    "it nevertheless provides a constraint on the general character of renormalization group flows for a wide variety of asymptotically free field theories with ir fixed points . in specific cases it may be possible to prove the inequality via the route of section 3 .",
    "we have noted that the inequality can be violated for field theories with non - trivial uv fixed points , and have provided an example of such a theory in section ( 5.2 ) .",
    "the inequality can also be valid for theories with non - trivial ultraviolet fixed points , provided that @xmath54 is sufficiently positive over a large temperature range .",
    "finally , it is interesting to apply the inequality to chiral gauge theories . in particular , in a model due to bars and yankielowicz @xcite in which the anomaly matching conditions are consistent with the formation of massless composite fermions , the inequality leads to a nontrivial constraint on the infrared spectrum . in a future paper ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) , we will discuss the application of the inequality to this and several other chiral gauge models .",
