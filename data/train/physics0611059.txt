    "optical transport in disordered dielectric materials can be described as a multiple scattering process in which light waves are randomly scattered by a large number of separate elements .",
    "to first approximation this gives rise to a diffusion process .",
    "the propagation of light waves inside disordered dielectric systems shows several analogies with electron transport in conducting solids @xcite and the transport of cold atom gasses @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting situation arises when optical gain is added to a random material . in such materials light",
    "is multiply scattered and also amplified .",
    "they can be realized , for instance , in the form of a suspension of micro particles with added laser dye or by grinding a laser crystal .",
    "optical transport in such systems is described by a multiple scattering process with amplification .",
    "if the total gain becomes larger then the losses , fluctuations grow and these systems exhibit a lasing threshold .",
    "the simplest form of lasing in random systems is based on diffusive feedback  @xcite where a diffusion process traps the light long enough inside the sample to reach an overall gain larger then the losses .",
    "interference effects do not play a role in this form of random lasing .",
    "diffusive random lasing has been observed in various random systems with gain , including powders , laser dye suspensions , and organic systems  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of such system shows several analogies with a regular laser , including gain narrowing , laser spiking and relaxation oscillations @xcite .",
    "reports in literature of complex emission spectra from random lasers containing a collection of spectrally narrow structures @xcite have triggered a debate about the possibility of lasing of anderson localized modes in random systems  @xcite .",
    "although anderson localized modes can , in principle , form very interesting lasers resonators in a gain medium  @xcite , there has been no experimental evidence to date of random lasing and localization in the same 3d random sample . in general , the observed spectra can be understood via a multiple scattering description based on the amplification of statistically rare long light paths that does not require localization or even interference  @xcite . these emission spectra exhibit a strongly chaotic behaviour , related to the statistical properties of the intensity above and around the laser threshold .",
    "theoretical descriptions of light transport in amplifying disordered media and random lasing have been based so far on a diffusive mechanism  @xcite , using , for instance , a master - equation approach  @xcite . to accommodate the existence of localization related effects in the diffusion regime , ` anomalously localized states '",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "other attempts to describe random lasing include monte carlo simulations @xcite , finite difference time domain calculations @xcite , and an approach using random matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these studies is that the statistical properties of a disordered optical system change with the addition of optical gain .",
    "random lasers were found to exhibit , for instance , strong fluctuations of their laser threshold @xcite .",
    "it was also proposed that such systems can exhibit lvy type statistics in the distribution of intensities  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on a detailed study of the statistical fluctuations of the emitted light from random amplifying media , using both general theoretical arguments and results from numerical studies .",
    "we find that the characteristic scales of the diffusive motion of photons lead to gaussian or power - law ( lvy ) distributed fluctuations depending on external parameters .",
    "the lvy regime is limited to a specific range of the gain length , and gaussian statistics is recovered in the limit of both low and high gain .",
    "monte carlo simulations of a simplified model which includes the medium s population , and parallel processing of a large number of random walkers , demonstrate the two statistical regimes and provide a comparison with dynamical rate equations .",
    "in section  [ s : gen ] we present some general arguments to explain the origin of the lvy statistics in random amplifying media .",
    "in addition , we discuss the possibility of observing different statistical regimes .",
    "to check the validity of the proposed general scenario , we define a simple stochastic model that is suitable for numerical simulations ( section  [ s : model ] ) . the rate equation corresponding to its mean  field limit are introduced in section  [ s : mf ] .",
    "the results of monte carlo simulations are presented in section  [ s : mc ] and discussed in the context of experimental results in the concluding section .",
    "let us consider a sample of optically active material where photons can propagate and diffuse .",
    "our description is valid in the diffusive regime , hence we assume here that @xmath0 is smaller then the mean free path @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the origin of the lvy statistics can be understood by means of the following reasoning .",
    "spontaneously emitted photons are amplified within the active medium due to stimulated emission .",
    "their emission energy is exponentially large in the path length @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 where we have introduced the gain length @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the path length in a diffusing medium is a random variable with exponential probability distribution @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the average length of the photon path within the sample .",
    "the path length depends on both the geometry of the sample and the diffusion constant @xmath8 .",
    "a simple estimate of @xmath9 can be provided by noting that for a diffusive process with diffusion coefficient @xmath8 , @xmath7 is proportional to the mean first  passage time yielding @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the speed of light in the medium and @xmath12 is the smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian in the active domain ( with absorbing boundary conditions ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath13 with @xmath14 for an infinite slab or a sphere with @xmath15 being the thickness or the radius , respectively @xcite .    the combination of eqs .",
    "( [ expi ] ) and ( [ expl ] ) immediately provides that the probability distribution of the emitted intensity follows a power ",
    "law @xmath16 obviously the heavy  tail in eq .",
    "( [ pow ] ) holds asymptotically and the distribution should be cut  off below some value @xmath17 .",
    "the properties of the lvy distribution ( more properly termed lvy ",
    "stable ) are well known @xcite .",
    "the most striking one is that for @xmath18 the average @xmath19 exists but the variance ( and all higher  order moments ) diverges .",
    "this has important consequences on the statistics of experimental measurements , yielding highly irreproducible data with lack of self  averaging of sample  to  sample fluctuations . on the contrary , for @xmath20 the standard central ",
    "limit theorem holds , and fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "the gain length @xmath5 is basically controlled by population inversion of the active medium .",
    "increasing the latter , @xmath5 and the exponent @xmath21 ( see eq .",
    "( [ pow ] ) ) decrease thus enhancing the fluctuations . at first glance",
    ", one may thus infer that the larger the pumping , the stronger the effect . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath5 is a time ",
    "dependent quantity that should be determined self  consistently from the dynamics .",
    "indeed , above threshold the release of a huge number of photons may lead to such a sizeable depletion of the population inversion to force @xmath5 to increase .",
    "it can then be argued that when the depletion is large enough , the lvy fluctuations may hardly be detectable .    to put the above statements on a more quantitative ground we need to estimate the lifetime of the population as created by the pumping process .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we write the threshold condition as @xmath22 which is interpreted as ",
    "gain larger than losses \" , the latter being caused by the diffusive escape of light from the sample .",
    "note that the condition @xmath23 along with eqs .",
    "( [ lmed ] ) and ( [ pow ] ) implies @xmath24 at the laser threshold .    for short pump pulses ,",
    "the time necessary for the intensity to become large is of the order of the inverse of the growth rate @xmath25 .",
    "when this time is smaller than the average residence time within the sample @xmath26 , a sizeable amplification occurs on average for each spontaneously emitted photon , leading to a strong depletion of the population inversion . in this case",
    "we expect a gaussian regime where a mean field description is valid .",
    "the conditions for the lvy regime are therefore @xmath27 and @xmath28 and can be written as : @xmath29 note that the lower bound of the above inequalities correspond to @xmath30 .    without losing generality and for later convenience , let us focus on the case of a two  dimensional infinite slab of thickness @xmath15 . in fig .  [",
    "f : sog ] we graphically summarize equation ( [ bounds ] ) by drawing a diagram in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "this representation allows to locate three different regions corresponding to different statistics . for convenience",
    ", the line corresponding to the threshold @xmath24 is also drawn .",

    "it should be also emphasized that the boundary between lvy and gaussian statistics is not expected to correspond to a sharp transition ( as displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : sog ] ) but rather to a crossover region .    .",
    "for comparison with the simulations reported below , all quantities are expressed in dimensionless units @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the symbols correspond to the parameters of fig .",
    "[ f : pulse].,width=302 ]",
    "in order to provide evidence of the theoretical considerations presented in section [ s : gen ] , we introduce a general , yet easy to simulate , model of random lasing .",
    "we consider a sample partitioned in cells of linear size @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , we deal with a portion of a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "thus the center of each cell is identified by the vector index @xmath37 , with @xmath38 integers . in the following",
    "we will deal with a sample with a slab geometry i.e. @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the total number of lattice sites is thus @xmath41 where @xmath42 defines the slab aspect ratio .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath43 direction are assumed .    within each cell",
    "we have the population @xmath44 of excitations .",
    "we consider an hypothetical three  level system with fast decay from the lowest laser level .",
    "if the population in the latter can be neglected we can identify @xmath45 as the number of atoms in the excited state of the lasing transition .",
    "isotropic diffusion of light is modeled as a standard random walk along the lattice sites .",
    "the natural time unit of the dynamics is thus given by @xmath46 .",
    "we choose to describe the diffusion dynamics in terms of a set of @xmath47 walkers each carrying a given number of photons @xmath48 .",
    "this may be visualized as an ensemble of  beams \" propagating independently throughout the sample .",
    "each of their intensities changes in time due to processes of stimulated and spontaneous emission . a basic description of those phenomena can be given in terms of a suitable master equation @xcite that would require to take into account the discrete nature of the variables . to further simplify the model we consider that the population and number of photons within each cell are so large for the evolution to be well approximated by the deterministic equations for their averages . in other words , the rate of radiative processes is much larger than that of the diffusive ones and a huge number of emissions occurs within the time scale @xmath49 @xcite . with these simplifications @xmath45 and @xmath50 can be treated as continuous variables .",
    "altogether the model is formulated by the following discrete  time dynamics :    _ step 0 : pumping - _ the active medium is excited homogeneously at the initial time i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "the value @xmath52 represents the pumping level due to some external source .",
    "the initial number of walkers is set to @xmath53 .",
    "_ step 1 : spontaneous emission - _ at each time step and for every lattice site a spontaneous emission event randomly occurs with probability @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the spontaneous emission rate of the single atom .",
    "the local population is decreased by one : @xmath56 and a new walker is started from the corresponding site with initial photon number @xmath57 .",
    "the number of walkers @xmath47 is increased by one accordingly .    _ step 2 : diffusion - _ parallel and asynchronous update of the photons positions is performed .",
    "each walker moves with equal probability to one of its four nearest neighbours .",
    "if the boundaries @xmath58 of the system are reached , the walker is emitted and its photon number @xmath59 recorded in the output .",
    "the walker is then removed from the simulation and @xmath47 is diminished by one .",
    "_ step 3 : stimulated emission - _ at each step , the photon numbers @xmath60 of each walker and the population are updated deterministically according to the following rules : @xmath61 where @xmath45 is the population at the lattice site on which the @xmath62th walker resides .    stochasticity is thus introduced in the model by both the randomness of spontaneous emission events ( step 1 ) and the diffusive process ( step 2 ) .",
    "note that the model in the above formulation does not include non  radiative decay mechanisms of the population .",
    "furthermore , no dependence on the wavelength is , at present , accounted for ; in general @xmath63 .",
    "the initialization described in step 0 is a crude modelling of the pulsed pumping employed experimentally .",
    "it amounts to considering an infinitely short excitation during which the samples absorbs @xmath52 photons from the pump beam . as a further simplification we also assumed that the excitation is homogeneous throughout the whole sample .",
    "more realistic pumping mechanisms can be easily included in this type of modeling .",
    "more importantly , as we are going to study the time dependence of the emission , this type of scheme applies to the case in which the time separation between subsequent pump pulses is much larger than the duration of the emitted pulse ( i.e. no repumping effects are present ) .",
    "steps 1 - 3 are repeated up to a preassigned maximum number of iterations .",
    "the sum of all the photon numbers of walkers flowing out of the medium at each time step is recorded .",
    "the resulting time series is binned on a time window of duration @xmath64 to reconstruct the output pulse as it would be measured by an external photoncounter .",
    "this insures that each point is a sum over a large number of events and makes the comparison with ensemble - averaged results of the preceding section sensible .",
    "it should be emphasized that , although each walker evolves independently from all the others , they all interact with the same population distribution , which , in turn , determines the photon number distributions . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", the model therore describes these two quantities in a self - consistent way .    for convenience , we chose to work henceforth in dimensionless units such that @xmath36 , @xmath35 ( and thus @xmath65 ) .",
    "the only independent parameters are then @xmath55 , the initial population @xmath52",
    "( i.e. the pumping level ) and the slab sizes @xmath15 , @xmath66 .",
    "before discussing the simulation of the stochastic model it is convenient to present some results on its mean - field limit .",
    "when both the population and photon number are large we expect the dynamics to be described by the rate equations for the macroscopic averages .",
    "this means that , up to relatively small fluctuations , the individual realization of the stochastic process should follow the solution of @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of photons in each cell , @xmath69 denotes the two  dimensional discrete laplacian and @xmath70 in our case .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the case of a laterally infinite slab ( @xmath71 ) in which both @xmath45 and @xmath72 depend on the @xmath43 coordinate , only .",
    "absorbing boundary conditions are imposed , @xmath73 .",
    "the integration is started from the same initial conditions of the stochastic simulations , namely @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "as a first remark , we note that the threshold condition ( [ thr ] ) applies to ( [ rateq ] ) upon identifying @xmath76 we can thus define a critical value of the initial population @xmath77 . for @xmath78",
    "the total emission is very low being due to spontaneous processes that are only weakly amplified . on the contrary , for @xmath79 strong amplification",
    "occurs : the number of photons within the sample increases exponentially in time at a rate given by eq .",
    "( [ thr ] ) , @xmath80 .",
    "after the pulse has reached a maximum and the population is depleted , the emission decreases strongly .",
    "an estimate of the decay time of the pulse is given by solving the linearized equations around the stationary state @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields that the long  time evolution is approximated by @xmath83 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 with @xmath86 being suitable time - independent amplitudes .",
    "the above results have been checked by comparing them with the numerical solution of ( [ rateq ] ) obtained by simple integration methods of ordinary differential equations . in particular",
