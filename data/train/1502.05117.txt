    "electron elastic scattering and bremsstrahlung ( a process of emission of radiation upon collision of electrons with matter ) on quantum targets are important fundamental phenomena of nature with significance to both the basic and applied sciences and technologies . yet , to date",
    ", the knowledge on these phenomena upon electron collision with such important quantum targets as endohedral fullerenes @xmath0@c@xmath1 is largely lacking .",
    "endohedral fullerenes , ( also referred to , interchangeably , as _ endohedral atoms _ or just _ fullerenes _ in the present paper ) are nano - structure formations where an atom @xmath0 is encapsulated inside the hollow interior of a c@xmath1 fullerene .",
    "they are relatively novel and important objects of intense modern studies .",
    "in fact , the authors are aware of only one published work on the subject of low - energy electron elastic scattering off @xmath0@c@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "also , to the authors best knowledge , there seems to be an absence of a study of low - frequency bremsstrahlung by low - energy electrons scattered off @xmath0@c@xmath1 endohedral fullerenes .",
    "it is the ultimate aim of the present paper ( a ) to get a broader insight into properties of low - energy electron elastic scattering off @xmath0@c@xmath1 , ( b ) to provide the initial insight into features of electron low - frequency bremsstrahlung on @xmath0@c@xmath1 , and ( c ) to explore to a greater extent how said properties and features might evolve with changing the size , softness , and spin of the encapsulated atom . to meet this goal , the authors pick typical representatives of atoms from the family of noble gases ( namely , n , ar , and xe ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 transition - metals ( cr , mn , mo , and tc ) , alkaline ( ba ) , and rare - earth ( eu ) elements of the periodic table . as a result ,",
    "the basic features as well as characteristic similarities and discrepancies of electron elastic scattering and low - frequency bremsstrahlung on various endohedral fullerenes @xmath0@c@xmath1 are revealed , interpreted , and detailed .",
    "the quantities subjected to this study are the low - energy electron elastic - scattering phase shifts and cross sections as well as the total cross sections , dipole angular - asymmetry distributions , and the angle - resolved degree of polarization of low - frequency bremsstrahlung .",
    "the present study also has a significance which is independent of its direct applicability to endohedral fullerenes .",
    "this is because it falls into a mainstream of intense modern studies where numerous aspects of the structure and spectra of atoms under various kinds of confinements are being attacked from many different angles by research teams world - wide .",
    "this has resulted in a huge array of unraveled effects and data being accumulated in a large number of publications to date , see reviews @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "there , one finds a wealth of information on properties of single - electron , two - electron and many - electron atoms confined by impenetrable spherical , spheroidal , as well as open boundary potentials ( e.g. , see review papers in @xcite by aquino , p.  @xmath4 ; laughlin , p.  @xmath5 ; cruz , p.  @xmath6 ; garza and vargas , p.  @xmath7 ) , oscillator potentials ( e.g. , patil and varshni @xcite , p.  1 ) , potentials limited by conoidal boundaries ( ley - koo @xcite , p  .79 ) , debye potentials ( sil , canuto , and mukherjee @xcite , p.  115 ) , fullerene - cage potentials ( dolmatov @xcite , p.13 ; charkin et.al .",
    "@xcite , p.69 , amusia et.al .",
    "@xcite ) , potential with dihedral angles ( ley - koo and sun @xcite , p.  1 ) , _ etc_. the present study adds new basic knowledge to the existing collection of atomic properties under confinement .    the interaction of radiation and charged particles with endohedral atoms is a complicated multifaceted process .",
    "this is in view of a great variety of various effects that contribute to the process .",
    "it is , therefore , both desirable and important to understand how each of the `` facets '' contributes to , and results in this or that effect in , the processes of interest , rather than to get only the cumulative result . in the present paper ,",
    "we expose to light the impact of a `` static facet '' on @xmath8 elastic scattering and bremsstrahlung .",
    "this is achieved by considering these processes in the framework of an approximation referred to as the _ model static approximation _ in the present paper . in this approximation ,",
    "the c@xmath1 cage is modeled by an attractive spherical annular - potential well @xmath9 of certain inner radius @xmath10 , width @xmath11 , and depth @xmath12 . the c@xmath1 cage ,",
    "thus , is regarded as a non - polarizable target .",
    "the encapsulated atom @xmath0 is positioned at the center of the potential @xmath9 and is regarded as a non - polarizable target as well .",
    "the potential of @xmath0@c@xmath1 is defined as the sum of the potential @xmath9 and non - local hartree - fock ( hf ) potential of the encapsulated atom @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding hf equation is then solved in order to determine the wavefunctions and electron elastic - scattering phase shifts upon @xmath8 collision .",
    "note that this approximation , where the c@xmath1 is modeled by the the potential @xmath9 with the atom @xmath0 being at the center of the potential , has been used for the study of the interaction of photons and charged particles with endohedral fullerenes @xmath0@c@xmath1 on numerous occasions to now , see , e.g. , @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "also , the replacement of the c@xmath1 cage by the same potential @xmath9 was employed in work @xcite for the study of electron elastic scattering off empty c@xmath1 as well . in the same work ,",
    "the study of @xmath13 scattering was paralleled by the calculation performed in the framework of a sophisticated _ ab initio _ molecular - hartree - fock approximation combined with the schwinger multichannel scattering theory .",
    "the work @xcite provided a thorough , detailed comparison of calculated results for the @xmath13 scattering phase shifts as well as partial and total elastic - scattering cross sections obtained in the frameworks of these two approximations .",
    "a reasonable qualitative , and even semi - quantitative , agreement between some of the most prominent features of @xmath13 elastic scattering , predicted by the two calculations , was demonstrated .",
    "such agreement speaks in favor of the overall usability of the @xmath14-model - potential approximation to electron - fullerene collision .    in the present work",
    ", the electron collision energy @xmath15 is assumed to be sufficiently small ( @xmath16 ev ) . at such energies , the electron wavelength @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "it , thus , exceeds noticeably the bond length @xmath19 @xmath18 between the carbon atoms in c@xmath1 .",
    "correspondingly , the incoming electrons will `` see '' the c@xmath1 cage as a homogeneous rather than `` granular '' cage .",
    "this justifies the modeling of the c@xmath1 cage by a smooth potential , in general , such as the above introduced potential @xmath9 , in particular .",
    "furthermore , in the present work , the emphasis is on low - frequency bremsstrahlung , @xmath20 . in the latter case , ( a ) the bremsstrahlung phenomenon",
    "can easily be attacked in the framework of a low - frequency approximation @xcite and ( b ) the contribution of a tricky `` polarization bremsstrahlung '' amplitude @xcite ( and references therein ) can be safely excluded from the study .",
    "( the `` polarization bremsstrahlung '' amplitude is the amplitude of the photon emission by a target during its dynamical polarization by an incoming electron ) .    in summary ,",
    "the model static approximation employed in the present paper for the study of both low - energy electron elastic scattering and low - frequency bremsstrahlung upon @xmath21 collision is overall reasonable .",
    "its drawback is the omission of accounting for electron correlation in the @xmath21 system ( or , which is the same , the omission of polarization of the c@xmath1 cage and/or atom @xmath0 by an incident electron ) .",
    "however , first , a thorough description of electron scattering and bremsstrahlung on a multielectron target is too challenging for theorists even with regard to a free atom , not to mention a @xmath0@c@xmath1 target ; the development of a a corresponding comprehensive theory is for future years .",
    "second , in order to understand , interpret , and appreciate the impacts of correlation and other omitted effects on @xmath8 elastic scattering and bremsstrahlung one _ does _ need to know how the processes develop without accounting for such effects .",
    "the present study provides researchers exactly with such knowledge .",
    "moreover , the model static approximation allows one to uncover characteristic properties of the investigated phenomena which _ do _ exist without regard for details of bonding between the @xmath22 carbon atoms of the c@xmath1 cage , _",
    "etc_. in a sense , the present work unveils some of the most basic intrinsic properties of low - energy electron elastic scattering and electron low - frequency bremsstrahlung off @xmath23 fullerenes .",
    "it identifies the most interesting and/or useful future measurements or more rigorous calculations to be performed in order to advance this field of study .",
    "in the present work , the c@xmath1 cage is modeled by a spherical annular - potential well , @xmath9 : @xmath24 here , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the inner radius , thickness , and depth of the potential well , respectively ; their magnitudes are borrowed from ref .",

    "these values of the adjustable parameters are most consistent with the corresponding observations .    next , the wavefunctions @xmath33 and binding energies @xmath34 of atomic electrons ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the standard set of quantum numbers of an electron in a central field , @xmath39 is the electron spin coordinate ) are the solutions of a system of the `` endohedral '' hf equations [ in atomic units ( a.  u.  ) ] : @xmath40\\psi_{i } ( { \\bm x } ) + \\sum_{j=1}^{z } \\int{\\frac{\\psi^{*}_{j}({\\bm x'})}{|{\\bm x}-{\\bm x'}| } } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times[\\psi_{j}({\\bm x'})\\psi_{i}({\\bm x } ) - \\psi_{i}({\\bm x'})\\psi_{j}({\\bm x})]d { \\bm x ' } = \\epsilon_{i}\\psi_{i}({\\bm x } ) . \\label{eqhf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here",

    "( [ eqhf ] ) differs from the ordinary hf equation for a free atom by the presence of the @xmath9 potential in the equation .",
    "this equation is first solved in order to calculate the electronic ground - state wavefunctions of the encapsulated atom .",
    "once the electronic ground - state wavefunctions are determined , they are plugged back into eq .",

    "the structure of a semifilled shell atom is the `` spin - polarized '' hartree - fock ( sphf ) approximation developed by slater @xcite .",
    "the quintessence of sphf is as follows .",

    "is utilized for calculation both of the atomic and scattering states of @xmath0@c@xmath1 endohedral fullerenes , where @xmath0 is a semifilled shell atom .",
    "the impact of the c@xmath1 cage on the valence orbitals of the encapsulated atoms of interest is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ figwf ] .",
    "note that the @xmath115@xmath133 valence orbital of n@c@xmath1 , as well as the @xmath150 valence orbital of ar@c@xmath1 , practically coincide with respective orbitals of free n and ar .",
    "even the @xmath151 valence orbital of a bigger xe atom is only insignificantly altered upon its encapsulation inside of the c@xmath1 cage .",
    "therefore , these atoms are referred to as the `` compact '' atoms in the present paper . in contrast , the valence orbitals of the cr , mn , mo , tc , ba , and eu atoms are significantly drawn into the potential well , i.e. , into the region of the wall of c@xmath1 .",
    "these atoms are to be referred to as the `` soft '' atoms .    next ,",

    "in contrast to mn@c@xmath1 and tc@c@xmath1 , the c@xmath1 cage becomes _ spin - up _ charged in cr@c@xmath1 and mo@c@xmath1 .",
    "this is because of a significant _ spin - up _ electron density drain from a @xmath152@xmath133 spin - unpaired semifilled subshell of cr , or a @xmath153@xmath133 spin - unpaired semifilled subshell of mo , to the c@xmath1 wall .",
    "in contrast , the spin - dependent drain of the valence electron density does not take place in eu@c@xmath1 .",
    "this is because the @xmath154@xmath133 and @xmath154@xmath136 orbitals are drawn into the c@xmath1 cage equally .",

    "in contrast , as one moves from the compact ar and xe atoms to a soft ba atom , one sees the emergence of the well - developed low - energy narrow maximum in @xmath169 rather than a minimum .",
    "talking about the @xmath166-phase shifts , one notices how a practically monotonic behavior of @xmath170 versus @xmath15 is replaced by the presence of the broad minimum in @xmath171 .",
    "the latter , in turn , changes to the much narrower minimum in @xmath172 shifted toward lower electron energies .",
    "this is illustrative of the sensitivity of the electron elastic - scattering phase shifts to the size and softness ( or compactness ) of an encapsulated atom .",
    "the authors will renew the discussion of the @xmath173 phase shifts with @xmath174 later in this paper . at present , in order to continue the in - breadth discussion of the phase - shift topic , let us explore calculated data for @xmath173s and @xmath175s with @xmath176 , fig .",

    "for example , for @xmath179 , the phase shifts upon electron elastic scattering off any of the considered fullerenes are the same in the energy region of approximately @xmath180 to @xmath181 ev . at a greater energy , the graph for @xmath182 splits off the rest of the graphs",
    ". the splitting increases with increasing energy .",
    "in contrast , a close equivalency between @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 remains in the energy region up to @xmath186 ev . beyond this energy ,",
    "it is the graph for @xmath184 which splits off the graphs for @xmath183 and @xmath185 , and splitting increases with increasing energy . in turn ,",
    "the phase shifts @xmath183 and @xmath185 remain equal to each other in a broader energy region , up to @xmath187 ev . for higher orbital quantum numbers , @xmath188 , the energy region , where there is the equivalency between all phase shifts of interest expands noticeably with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "for example , for compact ar@c@xmath1 and xe@c@xmath1 as well as empty c@xmath1 , corresponding phase shifts become and remain identical in the whole considered energy domain when the orbital quantum number reaches the value of @xmath189 . for soft",
    "ba@c@xmath1 , however , the situation is clearly different , and @xmath190 remains noticeably split off the rest of the graphs even at @xmath189 .",
    "once again , the discussed results uncover the sensitivity of electron elastic scattering by @xmath0@c@xmath1 to the size , compactness , and softness of the encapsulated atom .",

    "in addition to results of ref.@xcite , the present study predicts the existence of the @xmath204- , @xmath205- , and @xmath165-anions ar@c@xmath206 and xe@c@xmath206 , in the given approximation .",

    "( [ levinson ] ) and table  [ table1 ] , one easily finds that @xmath210 whereas @xmath211 . for ba@c@xmath1 , however , the situation is somewhat different .",

    "the ba atom , however , is a less suitable atom to apply the independent - scattering approximation to .",
    "this is because ba , in contrast to ar and xe , transfers much of its valence electron density to the c@xmath1 cage .",
    "anyway , one , of course , would be too naive to expect that the independent - scattering approximation is anywhere perfect .",
    "the usability of it , as one can see , is somewhat limited .",

    "the free - xe @xmath223 phase shift decreases at a greater rate than the increasing phase shift @xmath225 .",

    "the sum of these two phase shifts starts increasing with decreasing @xmath15 in this energy region , and so should do @xmath168 as well .",
    "all of the above results in the emergence of the _ minimum _ in @xmath168 below @xmath227 ev . a close agreement between the thus predicted results for @xmath168 and calculated results obtained on the basis of the endohedral hf eq .",

    "[ figdd ] .    a similar analysis of the sum of the free - atom @xmath165-phase shift @xmath224 and @xmath225 ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) can easily lead one to the prediction of a low - energy _ maximum _ in @xmath169 below @xmath226 ev .",

    "[ figdd ] as well .",
    "it now becomes clear that the emergence of the minimum in @xmath168 but maximum in @xmath169 , below @xmath227 ev , is due to two reasons .",
    "first , this is because the free - xe @xmath223 phase shift starts falling down at a higher electron energy ( @xmath229 ev ) than the free - ba @xmath224 phase shift ( @xmath230 ev ) .",
    "second , this is because the decrease of @xmath224 occurs at a much greater rate than the decrease of @xmath223 in the corresponding electron energy region .",
    "thus , the discussed marked differences between @xmath168 and @xmath169 are associated primarily with the individuality of the free - xe and free - ba @xmath165-phase shifts , at a given phase shift @xmath225 .",
    "it also becomes clear why the low - energy minimum in @xmath167 is broader than that in the above discussed @xmath168 ( see fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] ) the decrease of free - ar @xmath231 with decreasing energy occurs at much higher energies and at a noticeably slower rate than the decrease of free - xe @xmath223 in the whole energy region . as a result , this leads to the broader and shallow minimum in @xmath167 than in @xmath168 .",
    "it also becomes clear why there is the well - developed low - energy minimum in the @xmath166-phase shift @xmath172 , the much broader and shallower minimum in @xmath171 , but no minimum in @xmath170 ( see fig .  [ figarxeba03 ] ) .",
    "this is because ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) the decrease of free - ba @xmath232 with decreasing energy is sharper and occurs at the lower energy than the decrease of free - xe @xmath233 .",
    "this decrease of @xmath233 , in turn , is sharper and occurs at a lower energy than the decrease of free - ar @xmath234 .",
    "this induces the above noted differences between @xmath172 , @xmath171 , and @xmath170 .",

[ figarxeba ] .",
    "one learns from fig .",
    "[ figarxeba ] that the bremsstrahlung parameters are strongly oscillating functions of electron energy @xmath15 in the considered region of @xmath16 ev .",
    "also oscillatory functions of energy are the total electron elastic - scattering cross sections ; the latter is in accordance with results of earlier works @xcite . what catches one s eye , though , is the following .",
    "first , the spectral density @xmath239 of bremsstrahlung behaves quite differently than the total electron elastic - scattering cross section @xmath238 , especially for the case of ba@c@xmath1 . indeed , whereas the intensities of the first three maxima in each of @xmath238 are weakening with increasing energy , the intensities of the corresponding maxima in @xmath239 are , generally , not .",
    "moreover , surprisingly , differences in the depicted bremsstrahlung parameters between the four systems - ar@c@xmath1 , xe@c@xmath1 , ba@c@xmath1 , and empty c@xmath1 - are much more prominent than the differences between the corresponding total electron elastic - scattering cross sections @xmath240 .",
    "indeed , e.g. , there are practically no differences exist between @xmath241 and @xmath242 , and both of them differ insignificantly from @xmath243 in the whole energy region .",
    "this is indicative of a little impact of the presence of a `` compact '' encapsulated atom @xmath0 on @xmath244 elastic scattering . on the contrary ,",
    "noticeable , if not significant , differences in the bremsstrahlung parameters between all four systems are indisputable .",
    "the described results , thus , uncover that electron bremsstrahlung is more sensitive to the presence of a particular atom inside of c@xmath1 than the corresponding total electron elastic scattering cross section .",
    "this is valid even if the encapsulated atom is a `` compact '' atom .",
    "the authors attribute this primarily to that fact that the spectral density of bremsstrahlung depends on differences between electron elastic - scattering phase shifts , whereas @xmath238 depends on the absolute values of the phase shifts .",
    "the nitrogen atom n(@xmath245@xmath133@xmath245@xmath136@xmath246@xmath133@xmath246@xmath136@xmath247@xmath133,@xmath140s ) is the first atom with a multielectron semifilled subshell ( the @xmath115 subshell ) in the periodic table , thus being the smallest one among other high - spin multielectron atoms .",
    "n@c@xmath1 , therefore , serves as a good starting sample for the discussion of electron collision with high - spin endohedral fullerenes .",

    "note how elastic - scattering phase shifts of incident spin - up electrons , @xmath248 , differ from those @xmath249 of spin - down electrons .",
    "this can be easily understood in the framework of the sphf theory .",
    "namely , the differences are primarily due to the presence ( absence ) of exchange interaction between incident spin - up ( spin - down ) electrons with the electrons of the spin - unpaired spin - up @xmath115@xmath133-subshell of the atom .    furthermore , note particularly dramatic differences between the phase shifts @xmath250 and @xmath251 of the @xmath205@xmath136- and @xmath205@xmath133-scattered electronic waves .",
    "these phase shifts are seen to be taking different routes with decreasing @xmath15 .",

    "in contrast , the @xmath250 phase shift has a deep narrow minimum at @xmath253 ev , after which @xmath254 at @xmath255 .    in order to unveil the origin of the dramatic difference between @xmath250 and @xmath251 ,",
    "let us exploit both levinson theorem , eq .",
    "( [ levinson ] ) , and the independent - scattering approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eqd+d ] ) . in accordance with the latter , @xmath256 , where @xmath257 is the elastic - scattering phase shift of a spin - down(spin - up ) electron upon its collision with a free n atom . the free - n phase shifts @xmath258 and @xmath259",

    "note how @xmath258 starts , at @xmath260 ev , abruptly dropping to a zero at @xmath255 .",
    "this is in accordance with levinson theorem , because there are no @xmath261@xmath136 bound - states either in the ground - state structure of free n or in the field of n , in the sphf approximation .",
    "it is now easy to see that the sum of the two phase shifts @xmath258 and @xmath262 translates into the originally predicted low - energy minimum in @xmath250 .",
    "next , note that , in contrast to @xmath258 , the phase shift @xmath263 at @xmath255 .",
    "this , again , is in line with levinson theorem , because there is only one spin - unpaired spin - up subshell with @xmath264 ( the @xmath115@xmath133 subshell ) in the nitrogen configuration .",
    "correspondingly , this time , the sum of monotonically increasing @xmath259 and @xmath262 translates into _ steadily _ increasing @xmath251 with decreasing energy , thereby resulting in the marked differences in question between @xmath251 and @xmath250 .",
    "next , a trial calculation showed that , for partial electronics waves with @xmath176 , @xmath265 . therefore , because @xmath266s have already been plotted earlier in the paper , the phase shifts @xmath267 with @xmath268 are not plotted separately in the present paper .",

    "additionally , the cr atom has a second semifilled subshell which is the @xmath121@xmath133 subshell .",
    "moreover , both atoms are soft atoms , in contrast to n. they donate a noticeable part of their @xmath152-valence electron density to the c@xmath1 cage , making it `` spin - charged '' .",
    "the cr atom `` charges '' the c@xmath1 cage by a spin - up electron density , whereas mn `` charges '' the c@xmath1 cage primarily by a spin - down electron density , as was discussed earlier in the present paper .",
    "consequently , the study of electron collision with the cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 systems is an interesting case study .",
    "it allows one to learn about the modification of electron elastic scattering and bremsstrahlung versus ( a ) the increasing number of electrons in a semifilled subshell of an encapsulated atom , ( b ) the increasing number of semifilled subshells in the atom , and ( c ) the ability of the atom to `` spin charge '' the c@xmath1 cage either by a spin - up , or spin - down electron density .",

    "these values , in conjunction with the sphf ground - state configurations of cr and mn as well as levinson theorem , speak to that fact that cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 are capable of making negative ions .",
    "namely , they can bind either an external spin - up or spin - down electron into a @xmath204- , or @xmath205- , or @xmath165-state , but not into a state with @xmath278 .",
    "the binding properties of cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 are , thus , the same as the binding properties of compact ar@c@xmath1 , xe@c@xmath1 , and n@c@xmath1 .",

[ figwf ] ) , and yet binding properties of cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 are the same as in the case of ar@c@xmath1 , xe@c@xmath1 , and n@c@xmath1 .",
    "next , also interesting is that although the drain of the valence electron density from encapsulated cr and mn to the c@xmath1 cage is about as strong as in the case of encapsulated ba , the binding properties of cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 , nevertheless , differ from those of ba@c@xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 fullerenes do bind an extra electron into a @xmath204-state but can not bind it into a @xmath166-state , in contrast to ba@c@xmath1 .",
    "second , note how differently the @xmath204-phase shift @xmath279 behaves compared to @xmath280 , @xmath281 and @xmath282 at low energies .",
    "namely , @xmath279 has a well - developed oscillation near threshold , whereas @xmath280 , @xmath281 , and @xmath282 have not .",
    "the oscillation in @xmath279 looks similar to the oscillation emerging in the @xmath204-phase shift @xmath283 at about the same energy .",

    "this , however , is incorrect , otherwise all other @xmath204-phase shifts , namely , @xmath280 , @xmath281 , and @xmath282 would have possessed the same oscillation as well . thus , this is the case where the independent - scattering approximation fails to provide the answer to the question .",
    "the authors believe that a reason for the oscillation in @xmath279 but its absence in the other @xmath204-phase shifts under discussion is due to the following .",
    "let us recall that the cr has the spin - unpaired spin - up subshell @xmath152@xmath133 .",
    "this induces an additional difference between exchange interactions of incident spin - up and spin - down @xmath204-electrons with the electrons of the cr atom .",
    "perhaps , this difference , in turn , either facilitates ( for the @xmath204@xmath136-electronic wave ) or cancels ( for the @xmath204@xmath133-electronic wave ) a three - wave interference between the corresponding incident @xmath204-electronic wave and electronic waves scattered off c@xmath1 and encapsulated cr , near threshold . as a result , @xmath279 has but @xmath280 does not have the interference maximum ( or minimum ) near threshold . if the proposed understanding is correct , then it becomes also clear why neither of the @xmath204-phase shifts @xmath281 and @xmath282 has the oscillation near threshold .",

    "next , note that differences between the spin - up and spin - down _ bremsstrahlung _ parameters are stronger , both quantitatively and qualitatively , than the differences between the corresponding total electron _",
    "elastic - scattering cross sections_. for example , note how an insignificant , weakly - developed maximum in @xmath314 at @xmath315 ev transforms into a strong , broad maximum with a plateau - type top in the @xmath316 bremsstrahlung spectral density .",
    "the latter also differs quantitatively and qualitatively from @xmath317 .",
    "another noteworthy result is that the depicted in fig .",
    "[ figcr ] stokes polarization parameter @xmath318@xmath136 changes its sign twice in the narrow region of @xmath319 ev , whereas @xmath318@xmath133 remains always positive .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath305 collision where both @xmath320@xmath133 and @xmath320@xmath136 remain always positive ( fig .",
    "[ figmn ] ) .",
    "to summarize , one learns from the above discussion that a drain of the electron density , especially spin - dependent drain , from an encapsulated atom to the c@xmath1 cage has important consequences .",
    "it results in the enhanced sensitivity of @xmath321 collision both to the individuality of an encapsulated atom ( cp.n vs.cr vs.mn ) and spin - polarization of an incident electron .",
    "the mo( ... @xmath322@xmath133@xmath323@xmath133,@xmath119s ) and tc( ... @xmath322@xmath133@xmath323@xmath133@xmath323@xmath133,@xmath123s ) atoms have the valence - shell structures which look similar to those of the cr( ... @xmath324@xmath133@xmath325@xmath133,@xmath119s ) and mn( ... @xmath324@xmath133@xmath325@xmath133@xmath121@xmath136,@xmath123s ) , respectively .",
    "however , because of the greater values of the principal quantum numbers , the @xmath326@xmath133- and @xmath327@xmath133(@xmath136)-wavefunctions of mo and tc have an additional node compared to the corresponding wavefunctions of cr and mn .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to learn about differences and/or similarities between electron elastic scattering and bremsstrahlung on mo@c@xmath1 versus cr@c@xmath1 , as well as mn@c@xmath1 versus tc@c@xmath1 .",
    "calculated sphf @xmath204- , @xmath205- , @xmath165- , and @xmath166-electron elastic - scattering phase shifts of spin - up and spin - down electrons collided with mo@c@xmath1 and tc@c@xmath1 are depicted in figs .",
    "[ figmo03 ] and [ figtc03 ] , respectively .",
    "looking at the values of these phase shifts at @xmath292 , one learns about binding properties of the mo@c@xmath1 and tc@c@xmath1 fullerenes .",
    "they appear to be the same as those of cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 .",
    "namely , both mo@c@xmath1 and tc@c@xmath1 are capable of binding an extra electron into a @xmath204- , or @xmath205- , or @xmath165-bound state , but not into a state with @xmath278 , regardless of the spin polarization of the electron .",
    "this , again , is in contrast to the ba@c@xmath1 case .",
    "next , note that the @xmath328 and @xmath329 phase shifts , except for @xmath330 , behave similarly to the corresponding phase shifts due to electron scattering off cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 ( figs .  [ figcr03 ] and [ figmn03 ] ) . the following two cases of the similarities and differences between these phase shifts",
    "are particularly noteworthy .",
    "first , one can see that the spin - down phase shift @xmath331 ( similar to @xmath279 ) has a well - developed oscillation near threshold .",
    "this is in contrast to the spin - up phase shift @xmath332 ( similar to @xmath280 ) as well as the @xmath204-phase shifts @xmath333 ( similar to @xmath334 ) .",
    "the noted feature admits the same interpretation developed for the @xmath204-phase shifts upon electron collision with cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 ( refer to the discussion above ) .",
    "accordingly , the oscillation in @xmath331 is because of the constructive three - wave interference between the incident @xmath204@xmath136-electronic wave and electronic waves scattered off the mo atom and c@xmath1 , in contrast to the case of @xmath204@xmath133-scattering .",
    "second , an interesting feature can be revealed if one inter - compares calculated @xmath165@xmath136-phase shifts @xmath330 ( fig .  [ figtc03 ] ) , @xmath335 ( fig .  [ figmo03 ] ) , @xmath287 ( fig .  [ figmn03 ] ) , and @xmath286 ( fig .  [ figcr03 ] ) between themselves .",
    "namely , one finds that @xmath330 has a sharp _ maximum _ near threshold in contrast to the _ minima _ in all other phase shifts under discussion .",
    "the origin of the minima in @xmath287 and @xmath286 was interpreted above .",
    "a trial calculation showed that the origin of the minimum in @xmath335 admits exactly the same interpretation as well .",
    "namely , in accordance with levinson theorem the free - mo phase shift drops down to the value of @xmath336 , i.e. , @xmath337 , at @xmath255 .",
    "then , with the help of the independent - scattering approximation , one easily finds that @xmath335 , defined as @xmath338 , must have a minimum near threshold .",
    "an attempt to explain the emergence of the _ maximum _ in @xmath330 near threshold in the similar manner , however , basically fails . indeed , the addition of the free - tc phase shift ( fig .  [ figtc03 ] , dash - dot - dotted line ) to @xmath225 results in the emergence of a minimum rather than a maximum in @xmath339 ( fig .  [ figtc03 ] , dotted line ) .",
    "the implication is that the independent - scattering approximation is a poor approximation for the case of the @xmath165@xmath136-electron scattering off tc@c@xmath1 , at low electron energies .",
    "nevertheless , the maximum in @xmath330 seems to have everything to do with the behavior of the free - tc phase shift @xmath340 at @xmath255 .",
    "otherwise , it would be totally unclear why there is a sudden decrease of @xmath330 to @xmath341 ( note , @xmath342 + [ \\delta_{d}^{\\rm c_{60}}(0)=\\pi]$ ] ) .",
    "next , calculated sphf electron elastic - scattering phase shifts of spin - up and spin - down electrons with @xmath176 upon their collision with mo@c@xmath1 and tc@c@xmath1 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figmotc49 ] .",
    "one can see that , similar to the case of electron scattering off cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 , the difference between the spin - up and spin - down phase shifts is quickly decreasing with increasing @xmath36 and practically vanishes .",
    "the differences in the phase shifts between electron scattering off mo@c@xmath1 and c@xmath1 , as well as between tc@c@xmath1 and c@xmath1 are decreasing as well , with increasing @xmath36 . yet",
    ", they remain visible for all @xmath36s under discussion .",
    "finally , the spectral density @xmath269 , angular - asymmetry parameter @xmath270 , and stokes polarization - parameter @xmath105@xmath133@xmath271@xmath237 of low - frequency bremsstrahlung , as well as the total electron elastic - scattering cross sections @xmath272 upon electron collision with mo@c@xmath1 and tc@c@xmath1 are depicted in figs .",
    "[ figmo ] and [ figtc ] , respectively .",
    "one can see that the differences between spin - up and spin - down electron elastic scattering as well as bremsstrahlung are greater for @xmath343 than @xmath344 collision .",
    "this is exactly for the same reason as the differences between electron collisions with cr@c@xmath1 and mn@c@xmath1 .",
    "this is not accidental , because mo ( similar to cr vs.mn ) , has a greater spin than tc .",
    "in addition , mo ( similar to cr vs.mn ) `` charges '' the c@xmath1 shell by the spin - up electron density whereas tc does the exact opposite , as was discussed earlier in the paper .    in view of the above",
    ", it is also interesting to compare directly calculated data for @xmath302 and @xmath303 scattering with those for @xmath343 and @xmath344 scattering , respectively ( see fig .  [ crmnmotc ] ) .    by studying fig .",
    "[ crmnmotc ] , one arrives at spectacular findings which are interesting in themselves .    first ( see fig .",
    "[ crmnmotc],@xmath345 ) , it appears that _ spin - up _ electron _ elastic - scattering cross sections _ for the corresponding pairs of fullerenes with like electron configurations ( cr vs.mo and mn vs.tc ) are equal in the whole range of considered electron energies , to almost an excellent approximation , i.e. , @xmath346 and @xmath347 .",
    "the same is observed for the corresponding _ bremsstrahlung spectral densities _ as well ( see fig .",
    "[ crmnmotc],@xmath348 ) , though the latter is true only in the electron energy range up to approximately @xmath349 ev . there ,",
    "indeed , @xmath350 and @xmath351 , to a nearly excellent approximation .",
    "it is only above @xmath352 ev that the corresponding bremsstrahlung spectral densities starts deviating from each other .",
    "second , above approximately @xmath353 ev , a sort of switching occurs between the pairs of fullerenes for which _ spin - up _ bremsstrahlung spectral densities become nearly perfectly equaled .",
    "they now `` pair '' by a principle of the _ closest _ proximity in the same _ row _ of the periodic table : @xmath354 and @xmath355 .    as for collision of _ spin - down _ electrons with the discussed fullerenes ( see figs .",
    "[ crmnmotc],@xmath356 and @xmath165 ) , the situation there is not so deterministic or simple as for scattering of _ spin - up _ electrons .",
    "in particular , the case of the spin - down electron bremsstrahlung off the cr@c@xmath1 fullerene singles out as a stand alone case .",
    "eu( ... @xmath357@xmath133@xmath358@xmath133@xmath149@xmath136 , @xmath131s ) is the first atom in the periodic table with the most capacious semifilled subshell - the @xmath132@xmath133 subshell .",
    "the eu atom , thus , is an atom with the highest spin .",
    "therefore , electron collision with eu@c@xmath1 represents another interesting case study .",
    "calculated sphf electron elastic - scattering phase shifts of spin - up and spin - down electrons with @xmath359 scattered off eu@c@xmath1 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figeu03 ] .    first , looking at the values of the depicted phase shifts at @xmath277 , one concludes , with the help of levinson theorem , that , similar to ba@c@xmath1 , the eu@c@xmath1 fullerene is capable of binding an extra electron into a @xmath205- , or @xmath165- , or @xmath166-state , but not into a @xmath204-state .",
    "second , note how the @xmath166-phase shift @xmath360 of a scattered _ spin - up _ electron differs drastically from the @xmath166-phase shift @xmath361 of a scattered _ spin - down _ electron .",
    "the reason for this is similar to the reasons for the drastic differences between the @xmath165@xmath133- and @xmath165@xmath136-phase shifts in electron collisions with the transition - atom metallo - fullerenes discussed above .",
    "specifically , this is owing to the presence of the only spin - unpaired @xmath166-subshell ( @xmath132@xmath133 ) in the ground state of eu . in accordance with levinson theorem , the free - eu spin - down phase shift @xmath362 at @xmath255 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath363 phase shift ( fig .  [ figeu03 ] , dash - dot - dotted dotted line ) is decreasing with decreasing energy @xmath15 .",
    "starting at @xmath186 ev , the rate of the decrease of @xmath361 overtakes the rate of the increase of @xmath364 , with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "correspondingly , in accordance with the independent - scattering approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eqd+d ] ) , the phase shift @xmath365 starts falling down , with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "however , at yet lower energies , below approximately @xmath353 ev , the situation reverts to the exact opposite .",
    "it is now the rate of the increase of @xmath364 that overtakes the rate of the decrease of @xmath363 . as a result ,",
    "in accordance with the independent - scattering approximate , the phase shift @xmath361 starts increasing at @xmath255 .",
    "correspondingly , the well - developed low - energy minimum emerges in @xmath361 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ figeu03 ] .",
    "in contrast to @xmath363 , the free - eu phase shift @xmath366 ( not plotted ) steadily increases to the value of @xmath336 at @xmath255 ( the latter is due to levinson theorem ) .",
    "accordingly , so does the phase shift @xmath360 as well . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath367 and @xmath360 phase shifts take drastically different routes at low electron energies ( see fig .",
    "[ figeu03 ] ) .",
    "third , the differences between other phase shifts with @xmath368 , @xmath369 , are seen to be small to negligible .",
    "this is because the @xmath132@xmath133 subshell of eu is collapsed deep into the inner region of the atom .",
    "consequently , exchange interaction between incident spin - up ( spin - down ) electrons , whose @xmath368 , and the @xmath370@xmath133-electrons is small .",
    "this largely eliminates differences in the overall impact of exchange interaction on @xmath371 and @xmath372 , thereby making them nearly equal .",
    "calculated sphf phase shifts @xmath373 of spin - up and spin - down electronic waves for @xmath268 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figeu49 ] .",
    "one can see that there is little - to - no spin - dependence of the phase shifts with @xmath176 .",
    "this is in accordance with the explanation provided above .",
    "next , note that , for a given @xmath374 , the difference between @xmath375 and the phase shift @xmath376 is increasing with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "this is in line with the corresponding results found above for electron scattering off other fullerenes .",
    "furthermore , note how the difference between @xmath377 and @xmath178 is decreasing with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "yet , the difference remains quite visible for all @xmath36s , similar , e.g. , to the cases of @xmath378 and @xmath379 scattering .    finally , calculated sphf spin - up and spin - down spectral density @xmath269 , angular - asymmetry parameter @xmath270 , and stokes polarization parameter @xmath105@xmath133@xmath271@xmath237 of low - frequency bremsstrahlung , as well as the total electron elastic - scattering cross sections @xmath272 due to electron scattering off eu@c@xmath1 are depicted in fig .  [ figeu ] .",
    "one can see that there are energy regions where the electron elastic - scattering cross sections , as well the parameters of bremsstrahlung for spin - up electrons differ either little - to - none or strongly from the corresponding results for spin - down electrons .",
    "this , once again , is similar to results of the other case studies discussed above .",
    "however , what makes the eu@c@xmath1 additionally exclusive , compared to the discussed other fullerenes , is that both _ spin - up _ @xmath380 and @xmath381 have a well - developed narrow maximum at @xmath382 ev .",
    "the latter is absent in the spectra of the other fullerenes .",
    "a trial calculation showed that this maximum is due to the incident @xmath165@xmath133-electronic wave .",
    "this is indicative of the entrapment of the @xmath165@xmath133-electronic wave inside eu@c@xmath1 , at @xmath382 ev .",
    "interesting , the maximum is absent in _ spin - down _ @xmath383 of eu@c@xmath1 .",
    "this observations is interesting .",
    "it shows that the presence of a bigger - sized soft atom @xmath0 inside c@xmath1 can result in a selective ( with respect to the electronic spin and/or orbital momentum @xmath36 ) entrapment of incident electronic waves inside @xmath0@c@xmath1 , at certain energies .",
    "the present work has provided the detailed insight into possible features of low - energy electron elastic scattering and low - frequency bremsstrahlung upon electron collisions with @xmath0@c@xmath1 fullerenes gained in the framework of the simple and yet reasonable model static approximation .",
    "this was achieved by studying the dependence of these processes on the individuality of encapsulated atoms @xmath0 and spin - polarization of incident electrons .",
    "the chosen atoms @xmath0 were thoughtfully picked out as the typical representatives of atoms of different rows of the periodic system . the study has also revealed modifications in binding properties of @xmath0@c@xmath1 fullerenes , as well as their ability to trap ( selectively ) incident electronic waves , versus the size of the encaged atom . of certain interest",
    "is the proposed independent - scattering approximation according to which electron elastic - scattering phase shifts upon @xmath384 collision can be evaluated as a simple sum of the phase shift due to @xmath385 collision and the phase shift due to collision with the free atom @xmath0 , for certain occasions .",
    "results of the work identify , at the given level of approximation , the most interesting and/or useful future measurements or more rigorous calculations to perform .",
    "the present study also provides researchers with a wealth of the background information which is useful for future studies aimed at elucidating of the significance of dynamical polarization and correlation effects in these processes .",
