    "stochastic billiards deal with the motion of a particle inside a connected domain in the euclidean space , travelling in straight lines inside the domain and subject to random bouncing when hitting the boundary .",
    "they are motivated by problems of transport and diffusion inside nanotubes , where the complex microscopic structure of the tube boundary allows for a stochastic description of the collisions : they can be viewed as limits of deterministic billiards on tables with rough boundary as the ratio of macro to micro scales diverges  @xcite . see also  @xcite and  @xcite for a detailed perspective from physics and chemistry , and  @xcite for basic results .",
    "a natural reflection law is when the outgoing direction has a density proportional to the cosine of its angle with the inner normal vector , independently from the past .",
    "this model , originally introduced by martin knudsen , is called the knudsen stochastic billiard .",
    "it has two important features : the uniform measure on the phase space is invariant for the dynamics , and moreover it is reversible . to understand large time behavior of knudsen billiards",
    ", one needs to consider infinite domains .",
    "recurrence and transience is studied in  @xcite , for billiards in a planar tube extending to infinity in the horizontal direction , under assumptions of regularity and growth on the tube . for the physically relevant case of an infinite tube which is irregular but has some homogeneity properties at large scale ,",
    "the description of the tube as a random environment has been introduced in  @xcite : the domain is the realization of a stationary ergodic process indexed by the horizontal coordinate .",
    "diffusivity of the particle is studied in this paper in dimension @xmath6 : generically , when the tube does not have arbitrarily long cavities , the billiard is diffusive in dimension @xmath3 , and also for @xmath7 when the billiard has `` finite horizon '' .",
    "reversibility allows to find the limit of the environment seen from the particle , and to use the appropriate techniques which have been extended to random walks in random environments ( rwre ) .",
    "we briefly mention  @xcite for the non - equilibrium dynamics aspects of the billiard and some features as a microscopic model for diffusion .    in the model of  @xcite the large - scale picture of the motion of the particle is purely diffusive",
    "; in particular , the limiting velocity of the particle equals zero . in this paper",
    ", we consider a stochastic billiard in a random tube as in  @xcite traversed by a flow with constant current to the right ; our goal is to prove the law of large numbers ( with positive limiting velocity ) .",
    "this current is modelled in the following way : the jumps in the positive direction are always accepted , but the jumps in the negative direction are accepted with probability  @xmath8 , where  @xmath9 is the horizontal size of the attempted jump .",
    "this method of giving a drift to the particle has the following advantage : the reversibility of the stochastic billiard is preserved ( although , of course , the reversible measure is no longer the same ) , which simplifies considerably the analysis of the model . in view of the above , the large scale picture",
    "is expected to be similar to the one - dimensional rwre with a drift when the environment is given by a `` resistor network '' with a similar acceptance / rejection mechanism ; the environment is not i.i.d .  but stationary ergodic , the jumps are not nearest neighbor but _",
    "unbounded_.    we review known results on the law of large numbers for transient rwres on  @xmath0 . for nearest neighbor jumps , the sub - ballistic and ballistic regimes  meaning that the speed is zero , resp .",
    "non zero  are fully understood ( e.g. , @xcite and section  1 in  @xcite ) with the explicit formula of solomon for the speed  @xcite in the case of i.i.d . environment ; the extension to stationary ergodic environment is given in  @xcite .",
    "when the jumps are bounded but not nearest neighbor , key  @xcite shows that transience of the walk to the right amounts to positivity of some middle lyapunov exponent of a product of random matrices .",
    "the regime where the law of large numbers holds with a positive speed is characterized in brmont s",
    "@xcite by the positivity of this exponent and existence of an invariant law for the environment absolutely continuous to the static law , but no explicit formula is anymore available .",
    "goldsheid  @xcite gives sufficient conditions ( which are also necessary in the case of i.i.d.environment ) , and also for the quenched central limit theorem . for completeness , we mention a result of bolthausen and goldsheid  @xcite for recurrent rwres with bounded jumps : if the quenched drift is not a.s .",
    "zero , the typical displacement at time  @xmath10 is of order @xmath11 , i.e. , the rwre has a similar lingering behavior as sina s walk .",
    "the case of unbounded jumps has been very seldom considered ; in fact , we can only mention that andjel  @xcite proves a 0 - 1 law when the jumps have uniform exponential tails .    in this paper , we prove the law of large numbers with a positive speed for rwre on  @xmath0 with unbounded jumps , under the following assumptions : stationary ergodic environment , ( e ) uniform ellipticity ; ( c ) uniform ( and integrable , but not necessarily exponential ) tails for the jumps ; ( d ) strong uniform transience to the right .",
    "we do not assume reversibility of the rwre .",
    "the strategy is to consider an auxiliary rwre with truncated jumps , to prove the existence of limits for the speed and the environment seen from the walker , then let the truncation parameter tend to infinity , and find a limit point for the environment measure .",
    "we mention also that assumption  ( d ) precludes the existence of arbitrarily long traps ",
    "i.e. , pieces of the environment where the random walk can spend an unusually large time  , and it is rather strong .",
    "we emphasize that we do not assume any mixing  hence , no independence  on the environment .",
    "as we see below , this set of conditions is adapted to our purpose . in our opinion , it is a challenging problem to find weaker conditions that still permit to obtain the law of large numbers for rwres with unbounded jumps with only polynomial tails . in particular , it would be especially interesting to substitute the current condition  ( d ) by a weaker one ; however , at the moment we do not have any concrete results and/or plausible conjectures which go in that direction .    to apply this result to the billiard in random tube ,",
    "we need a discretization procedure to compare the billiard to a random walk .",
    "this can be performed by coupling the billiard with an independent coin tossing ; the integer part of the horizontal coordinate of hitting points on the boundary , sampled at success times of the coin tossing , is an embedded rwre in some environment determined by the random tube .",
    "we check condition  ( d ) for the rwre by making use of the reversibility of the billiard and spectral estimates ( as in  @xcite for a reversible rwre on  @xmath12 ) .",
    "this coupling allows to transfer results from the rwre  a simplified model  to the stochastic billiard  a much more involved one . under fairly reasonable assumptions on the random tube , we obtain for the billiard the law of large numbers with positive speed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we define the two models and state the results in the next section .",
    "section  [ s_proofs_rwre ] contains the proofs for rwre , and section  [ s_proofs_billiard ] those for the stochastic billiard , including the construction of the coupling with the rwre .",
    "now , we formally define the random billiard with drift in a random tube and the one - dimensional random walk in stationary ergodic random environment with unbounded jumps .    already at this point",
    "we warn the reader that the ( continuous ) random environment for the billiard processes and the ( discrete ) random environment for the random walk are denoted by the same letter  @xmath13 .",
    "hopefully , this creates no confusion since at all times we tried to make it clear which model is under consideration .",
    "also , we use the same notation  @xmath14 ( the law of the random environment ) for both models .      we define the model of random billiard in a random tube , basically keeping the notations of  @xcite .    in this paper",
