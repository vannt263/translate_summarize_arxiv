    "a polymer gel is a network of cross - linked polymeric chains permeated by a diffusing fluid .",
    "temporal changes of fluid content bring about local swelling or de - swelling of the gel @xcite , which in turn may determine substantial changes of shape .",
    "two key properties affecting the amount of swelling are the compliance of the polymeric network and the affinity between the polymer and the fluid . since these properties can be finely tuned during gel synthesis , understanding how they affect shape changes is crucial to controlling and harnessing shape changes .",
    "swelling  induced shape changes can be particularly dramatic in thin bodies , such as plates or rods @xcite .",
    "for example , the experiments reported in @xcite feature elastic instabilities during swelling of composite polymeric plates .",
    "the paper @xcite investigates experimentally  observed time dependent bending of a thin plate of polymer gel during the transient that follows the deposition of a solvent droplet on one of its faces .",
    "mechanical theories of polymer gels and , more generally , of strained solids through which diffusion of a fluid takes place @xcite have been elaborated drawing from the work of gibbs concerning the role of chemical potential to describe the interaction between a solid and a fluid phase @xcite and from the work of biot on poroelastic media @xcite . in these theories ,",
    "a polymeric gel is modeled as a single continuum where diffusion of a chemical species is driven by the gradient of its chemical potential .",
    "constituive equations are obtained from a dissipation principle that takes explicitly into account the energetic flux associated to the motion of the fluid relative to the solid . a parallel line of research @xcite models the diffusing fluid and the strained solid as two superposed and interacting continua , whose governing equations result from the application of truesdell s theory of mixtures @xcite .",
    "it would be desirable to have a comparison of the two approaches , showing to what extent they are equivalent .",
    "a comparison in the setting of poroelasticity can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we restrict our considerations to physical situations where the evolution of the polymer gel involves small departures from an equilibrium state . following",
    "@xcite we perform a formal linearization procedure of the mechanical equations governing motion and diffusion in a polymer gel proposed in @xcite .",
    "we then arrive at the following constitutive equations : @xmath0 which govern the stress increment @xmath1 with respect to the reference state and the flux of diffusant @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath3 is a fourth  order elasticity tensor acting on the linear strain @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the molar volume of the fluid , @xmath6 is the mobility tensor ; the pressure @xmath7 entering fick s law @xmath8 is proportional to the fluid s chemical potential and plays the role of lagrange multiplier associated to the incompressibility constraint @xmath9 between the the increment @xmath10 of the fluid concentration and the local volume change , as measured by the divergence @xmath11 of the displacement field @xmath12 .",
    "the constitutive equations are combined with the balance equations : @xmath13 to obtain an evolution system governing displacement @xmath12 and pressure @xmath7 . in problems concerning deformations",
    "coupled with diffusion , inertial forces are typically neglected . then , on identifying @xmath14 with a prescribed body force of dead  load type , and on ruling out the unknowns @xmath1 and @xmath2 through their constitutive equations , we arrive at the following system in the uknowns @xmath12 and @xmath7 :    [ eq:40 ] @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the diffusivity tensor .",
    "it is worth noticing that the constitutive equation @xmath17 can be formally obtained as a specialization of the equation governing the stress of a saturated linear poroelastic medium ( * ? ? ?",
    "55 ) in the case when the effective stress coefficient is equal to one .",
    "moreover , the incompressibility constraint can be interpreted as the limit of the response equation for the pore fluid ( * ? ? ?",
    "59 ) in the limit when the biot modulus tends to infinity .",
    "in fact , to a certain extent , the equations of polymer gels can be considered as a specialization of the theory of saturated poroelastic media : biot himself remarks in @xcite that his `` pressure function '' applies to _  [ ... ] a broader context where it plays the role of `` chemical potential '' _ , whose applications are _ `` [ ... ] not restricted to the presence of actual pores",
    ". the fluid may be in solution with the solid , or may be adsorbed .",
    "such phenomena are usually associated with the concept of capillarity or osmotic pressures . ''",
    "_ it is also worth noticing that the linear system we consider can be also considered as a special case of the equations of linear thermoelasticity ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.24 ) in the case when heat capacity vanishes and the stress ",
    "temperature tensor is equal to the identity .",
    "such analogy has been explicitly reckoned , for instance , in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "these observations put into perspective a number of theories concerning poroelastic and thermoelatic plates as relevant in the context we are considering . an earlier combination of poroelasticity with a structural theory was addressed by biot , who considers in @xcite the effect of fluid flow within a poroelastic slab under compression , and who shows that creep buckling takes place when the compression is above a `` lower '' critical value , and that if the load is increased then the rate of lateral deflection increases until it becomes infinite at an `` upper '' critical value . in @xcite taber",
    "proposes a theory describing the coupling between diffusion and bending in a poroelastic plate , based on the kirchhoff  love kinematics , on the plane - strain assumption , and on the assumption that diffusion of fluid takes place only in the direction orthogonal to the mid - plane of the plate .",
    "a theory that specifically addresses thin polymer gels coupled with fluid diffusion has more recently been proposed in @xcite concerning a planar beam whereby motion and diffusion are restricted to two dimensions . in that paper , the constitutive equations governing the relation between bending moment and curvature are obtained from the standard kinematic assumptions that the cross section of the beam remain straight , and that the stress along the transverse direction vanishes . within these assumptions ,",
    "two different models have been proposed : a two  dimensional diffusion model which allows the fluid to diffuse both in the axial and in the transverse direction of the beam ; a one  dimensional diffusion model which allows fluid diffusion only in the transverse direction , as in the above  mentioned paper by taber .",
    "comparison between the two models shows that the one dimensional model is still adequate to capture the response of the beam to pressure variations .",
    "more recently , the equations of a poroelastic plate under large strain have been derived using the virtual - powers approach combined with an enriched kinematics @xcite .",
    "all the above  mentioned derivations make use of _ ad hoc _ hypotheses to obtain a structural model .",
    "there is however a number of papers dealing with poroelasticity and thermoelasticity which make use of rigorous asymptotic analysis to obtain structural ( plate or beam ) models , in the spirit of @xcite : one considers a _ generating family _ of initial - boundary value depending on a vanishing parameter @xmath18 , designed in a way to capture the thinness of the body under scrutiny ( be it a plate or a beam ) , and studies the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of these problems as @xmath18 tends to null .",
    "one may naively expect that such a procedure , being rigorous , produces a definite answer concerning what structural model betters capture thinness .",
    "however , this is not the case : as pointed out in @xcite , the outcome of the asymptotic method depends crucially on the _ choice _ of the generating family , and different choices lead to different structural models . for example , there is more than one choice that can lead to the reissner ",
    "mindlin plate model @xcite , to models used for plate buckling @xcite , plates with residual stress @xcite or to the timoshenko beam theory @xcite .",
    "the generating families are usually obtained by writing the relevant equations ( in our case ,  ) on a collection of cylinders @xmath19 which shrink to the planar domain @xmath20 as @xmath21 tends to null .",
    "the coefficients in these equations , as well as the boundary conditions , can possibly depend on the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "most of these theories are essentially a variant of the kirchhoff  love plate equation or euler  bernoulli beam equation with an extra contribution to the bending moment coming from pressure inhomogeneities across the thickness .",
    "this contribution evolves in time as determined by the flow of fluid or thermal conduction within the plate and is itself affected by bending .    in the simplest setting of three - dimensional linear elasticity , the most popular approach to the derivation of plate equations by asymptotic analysis is to keep the elasticity tensor @xmath3 independent of @xmath21 , and replace the displacement field @xmath22 with the scaled displacement @xmath23 whose components are defined as ( _ cf .",
    "74 in sec .",
    "[ sec : plate - equations ] ) : @xmath24 it appears natural to replicate this pattern when mechanical effects are coupled with diffusion , and a simple calculation ( see the chain of argument that leads from eq .",
    "[ eq:75 ] to eq .",
    "[ eq:9 ] ) shows that if one wants the pressure @xmath7 to appear in the limit equation , then the original unknown @xmath25 should be rescaled by introducing the new unknown @xmath26 these scaling are essentially common to all asymptotic derivations we were able to find in the literature",
    ". however , there are still many degrees of freedom in the choice of the generating family of problems .",
    "this explains why so many different limit theories can be obtained .",
    "for example , the derivation of theories of thermoelastic plates presented in @xcite , where temperature plays the role of pressure , makes use of robin  type conditions on the top and bottom faces of the cylinder and considers three different scalings , which result in different limit problems .",
    "the paper @xcite , which is concerned with poroelastic plates , considers the regime where the diffusivity tensor @xmath27 scales as @xmath28 . in this case ,",
    "two systems of partial differential equations are obtained : the first is an elliptic system formulated on the 2d domain @xmath29 , which governs the in ",
    "plane components of displacement and the average pressure across the thickness ; the second is a system composed of the classical plate equation formulated on @xmath29 , coupled with a particular diffusion equation formulated on the domain @xmath30 whose peculiarity is that diffusion can take place only in the transverse direction .",
    "the result is essentially the same as the 1d stress - diffusion model discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider material symmetry of monoclinic type with respect to the plane containing @xmath29 , and we build two different generating families . for the first family ,",
    "the diffusivity tensor @xmath27 is independent of @xmath21 , so that the only datum that depends on @xmath18 is the thickness of the domain @xmath31 .",
    "we show in section [ sec : plate - equations ] that this family produces a two dimensional model where the value of the pressure across the thickness is the affine interpolation of the values of the pressure at the top and bottom face , as in theories describing thermal bending . for the second family",
    "we consider , the planar components of the diffusivity tensor are constant , while the transverse component scales as @xmath28 . as we show in section [ sec : diff - plate - model ] , this family generates the diffusive model proposed in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we put together the system of partial differential equations that arises in mechanical theories that describe diffusion of a solvent through a finitely  strained solid , and we linearize the resulting equations to arrive at an initial  boundary value problem that is the object of our asymptotic analysis . for the sake of coinciseness , we limit ourselves to presenting the key ingredients and we refer the reader eager for further details to the many presentation available in the literature , which we have listed in the introduction . moreover , we leave for the next section the specification of the relevant boundary and initial conditions .    as a start",
    "we recall , that for @xmath32 the region occupied by the body in its reference configuration , and for @xmath33 $ ] the time interval of interest , the unknown fields for the theory in question are : the _ deformation _",
    "@xmath34 , the _ piola stress _",
    "@xmath1 , the _ referential concentration of solvent _ @xmath35 ( a posisitive  valued scalar field ) , the _ referential solvent flux _ @xmath2 , and the _ solvent chemical potential _ @xmath36 .    for @xmath14 the dead body  force field , the aforementioned fields are required to satisfy the force and the mass  balance :    [ eq:39 ] @xmath37    as well as a set of constitutive equations consistent with the dissipation inequality @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the deformation gradient .    for applications to gels",
    ", it is usually assumed that both the polymer and the solvent be incompressible .",
    "this assumption does not imply that the admissible deformations of the gel as a whole are isochoric : volume changes , as measured by the determinant @xmath40 of the deformation gradient , may take place due to changes of the relative volume proportions of polymer and solvent .",
    "however , these changes must comply with the _ incompressibility constraint _ : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of solvent molecules per unit referential volume and @xmath5 is molecular volume .",
    "for @xmath43 the cofactor of @xmath44 , we have from that the rate of change of concentration is related to the rate of deformation gradient by @xmath45 . as a result , yields @xmath46 by comparing with we see that an important consequence of the incompressibility constraint is that the piola stress @xmath1 expend power in concomitance with the chemical potential @xmath36 , and hence only a combination of these fields , namely @xmath47 , can be constitutively prescribed .",
    "thus , in view of , we adopt the following constitutive equations :    [ eq:23 ] @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a concentration  dependent , positive definite mobility tensor . viewing as a constitutive equation for @xmath1 leaves the chemical potential not specified constitutively .",
    "in fact , within this theory , the chemical potential can not be determined only by solving the complete problem .",
    "the mechanical interpretation of @xmath36 comes through the decomposition @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the _ chemical potential of the pure solvent _ , and @xmath52 is the _",
    "solvent pressure_.    when put together , the balance equations , the compatibility condition , the incompressibility constraint , and the constitutive equations form a system of partial differential equations in the unknowns @xmath53 .",
    "our next task is to perform a formal linearization of this system about a suitable reference state . as a first step ,",
    "we take as reference state an equilibrium solution of the aforementioned system , where the body is undeformed , so that @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and both stress and solvent flux vanish .",
    "we stick to the convention of marking by a superimposed ring all fields that pertain to the reference state . accordingly , by we write    [ eq:25 ] @xmath56    in particular , in the reference state the solvent pressure is @xmath57 as our second step we consider small departures from the reference state and we write @xmath58 where @xmath12 is the _ displacement _ , @xmath59 is the _ displacement gradient _ , @xmath10 is the _ concentration increment _ , and ( _ cf . _ and ) @xmath60 is the _",
