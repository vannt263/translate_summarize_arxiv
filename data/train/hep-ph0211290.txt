    "the present work was partly motivated by the experience gained in the phenomenological description of the quadrupole electro - excitation of the @xmath0 within the linear @xmath1-model ( lsm ) and the chromo - dielectric model ( cdm ) in which the pionic degree of freedom was shown to play a dominant role @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the pion cloud practically saturates the electric and coulomb quadrupole transition strengths and qualitatively reproduces the @xmath2-behaviour of the amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , the results for the ratios of electro - magnetic couplings e2/m1 and c2/m1 at @xmath3 were found to be rather insensitive to the details of the models . in the lsm ,",
    "the absolute values of the transverse helicity amplitudes were well reproduced , although the underprediction of the strength at @xmath3 remains an open question . to pin down the pertinent model ingredients , one therefore needs to probe non - zero values of @xmath2 where effects of a possibly strong pion cloud in the interiors of the nucleon and the @xmath0 are manifested differently .",
    "we anticipate that the theoretical investigation of axial n-@xmath0 transition amplitudes @xcite in chiral quark models may reveal additional information on non - quark degrees of freedom in baryons . yet due to difficulties in consistent incorporation of the pion field , the model predictions for these amplitudes are very scarce @xcite , in contrast to the electro - magnetic sector . experimentally , the structure of the weak axial transition currents is explored by using weak probes @xcite or electron scattering @xcite .",
    "we have a stable world - average for the dominant coupling @xmath4 @xcite , but a very poor knowledge of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and the corresponding form - factors .",
    "we calculated the axial amplitudes in the cloudy - bag model ( cbm ) and in the lsm .",
    "in the linear @xmath1-model and related classes of models involving quarks interacting with chiral fields @xmath1 and @xmath7 the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath8    + u(\\sigma,\\roarrow{\\pi } ) + \\roarrow{j}\\roarrow{\\pi}\\right\\}\\>{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the quark source , @xmath10 is the pion conjugate momentum , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the free - quark and the @xmath1-meson terms , and @xmath13 is the meson self - interaction term . in the cloudy - bag model",
    "the @xmath1-field and the @xmath14-term are absent , while in the linear @xmath1-model all terms are present and @xmath14 is the well - known mexican - hat potential .",
    "the cdm has an additional scalar - isoscalar field which mimics the glueballs of qcd and dynamically confines the quarks @xcite .",
    "evaluating the commutator @xmath15 $ ] between eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( regardless of the model ) we obtain a virial constraint of the form @xmath18 where the source on the rhs of consists of the quark term and the term originating from the meson self - interaction ( if present ) : @xmath19 in the cbm we assume the usual perturbative form for the pion profiles using the experimental masses for the nucleon and @xmath0 , which fulfills ( [ offdiaggt ] ) .",
    "the method we used to impose this constraint in the lsm is described in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in computing the transverse ( @xmath20 ) , longitudinal ( @xmath21 ) , and scalar ( @xmath22 ) transition helicity amplitudes between states with definite four - momenta",
    ", we interpret our localised model states as wave packets of states with good linear momentum . extending",

    "the calculated @xmath4 is @xmath34 higher than the experimental average , but the @xmath2-dependence is reproduced to within a few percent in terms of the dipole cut - off parameter .",
    "a better result at @xmath3 can be obtained by determining @xmath31 from the calculated strong @xmath35 form - factor through the off - diagonal goldberger - treiman relation , yet the @xmath2-dependence becomes steeper , with a cut - off of @xmath36 .",
    "the disagreement between the two approaches can be attributed to an overestimate of the meson strength , a characteristic feature of lsm where only the meson fields bind the quarks .",
    "( still , the effect of the meson self - interaction is relatively weak in the strong coupling constants . )",
    "essentially the same trend is observed in the nucleon case where we obtain @xmath37 .",
    "the discrepancy with respect to the experimental value of @xmath38 is commensurate with the disagreement in @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , the overestimate of @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the lsm seems to persist even if the spurious centre - of - mass motion of the nucleon is removed @xcite .    in the cbm",
    "the picture is reversed . as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the quarks contribute to the @xmath41 and @xmath42 amplitudes , while @xmath43 is almost completely dominated by the pion pole .",
    "hence the calculated values of @xmath44 are too small , ranging from @xmath45 of the experimental estimate at @xmath46 to only @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath31 is similar as in the pure mit bag model ( to within @xmath49 ) , with a fitted dipole cut - off of @xmath50 .",
    "the off - diagonal goldberger - treiman relation is satisfied in the cbm , but @xmath31 calculated from @xmath51 has a steeper @xmath2-dependence with a cut - off of @xmath52 .",
    "the large discrepancy can be partly attributed to the fact that the cbm predicts a too low value for @xmath53 , and consequently for @xmath32 .",
    "the determination of the @xmath41 is less reliable because the meson contribution to the scalar amplitude is very sensitive to small variations of the profiles .",
    "however , the experimental value is very uncertain as well . neglecting the non - pole contribution to @xmath22 and @xmath54 ,",
    "the value of @xmath55 is dominated by the term @xmath56 , in agreement with the popular value of @xmath57 .    in accordance with our experience in the electro - magnetic sector , we find that the quark contribution alone strongly underestimates the @xmath58 amplitude .",
    "if only a linear coupling of pions to quarks is added , the situation does not improve since in such a case the pion contribution to @xmath58 vanishes .",
    "on the other hand , the inclusion of meson self - interaction which allows for a substantial deviation of the @xmath1-field from its vacuum value inside the baryon considerably increases @xmath58 .",
    "the lsm overestimates this contribution , but this is not the case in other chiral models which allow for a non - zero fluctuation of the @xmath1-field ; in a version of the njl model with nonlocal regulators @xcite the contribution of sea quarks to the nucleon @xmath39 is more than a factor of two weaker than the equivalent contribution of chiral mesons in the lsm .",
