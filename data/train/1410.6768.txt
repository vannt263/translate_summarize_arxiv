    "three - dimensional yang - mills ( ym ) theory is one important model in which it is possible to investigate nonperturbative aspects of gauge field theories such as color confinement .",
    "the theory has local degrees of freedom and the coupling constant is dimensionful .",
    "this properties indicates that this theory can be seen as an approximation for the high temperature phase of qcd with the mass gap in the role of the magnetic mass .",
    "it is important to note that in @xmath0 it is always possible to introduce a chern - simons term @xcite .",
    "this term provides a topological mass , opening the possibility for a deconfining phase due to the appearance of a massive excitation not present in the dual superconductor picture @xcite .",
    "color confinement is a challenging issue that has been studied in different approaches .",
    "one of them comes from the analysis of copies of gribov @xcite , known generally as gribov problem , which highlights the gribov - zwanziger model ( gz ) @xcite and its refined version ( rgz ) @xcite .",
    "one of the gribov mechanism properties is that it generates propagators for gauge fields with complex poles being impossible their identification with the propagation of particle physics , which is interpreted as confinement and known generally as gribov - zwanziger scenario .",
    "as is widely known the presence of the gribov problem is a general characteristic of the quantization procedure of yang - mills theories . in this procedure",
    "occur the existence of gribov copies that are , in fact , a general property of all the local covariant renormalizable gauge fixing @xcite .",
    "the presence of gauge copies results in zero modes of the faddeev - popov operator that makes the usual faddeev - popov construction incomplete .",
    "so the gribov mechanism is an interesting possibility of the investigation of confinement in ym theories in three dimensions .",
    "that is , ym - cs theory with the gribov mechanism has the possibility of a confined and a de - confined phase , depending on a fine tune between the gribov mass gap and the usual parameters in the pure ym - cs @xcite . in this case we have an interesting model with different phases .    in this context supersymmetry",
    "has been used as an important tool in the investigation of nonperturbative aspects of gauge theories . in confining behavior of supersymmetric theories , @xmath1 for example ,",
    "much has been done since the work of seiberg with super qcd .",
    "see reference @xcite and references therein that examine in detail the recent developments .",
    "and we can point out yet that in three dimensions there is currently a renewed interest in supersymmetry because it was recently found the correspondence known as @xmath2 @xcite , whose main example is the abjm theory @xcite , which is closely related to cs theory in the gauge sector .",
    "this correspondence is the realization that certain theories of supergravity in higher dimensions are dual of supersymmetric quantum field theory in lower dimensions , and thus makes it possible to relate the strong coupling region of supersymmetric quantum field theory with weak coupling of the supergravity .",
    "it is also important to note that due to the supersymmetric extension is also possible to introduce fermions in a natural way .",
    "of course this fermions are the gauge partners and are not in the fundamental representation as quarks . in spite of",
    "that they can be useful in order to understand the behaviour of confining fermions and the possibility of relations under gribov and supersymmetric theories .",
    "so in this paper we investigate the super - yang - mills chern - simons ( sym - cs ) theories ( @xmath3 ) with superfields formalism @xcite addressing the gribov problem and the gribov two - point correlator @xmath4 as well as a modified gribov zwanziger type correlator @xmath5 and thus obtaining information on how the theory ( sym - cs ) behaves in the presence of gribov horizon and how to obtain the gribov regime in a closest relation to the abjm scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the sym - cs theory in superspace @xmath0 , @xmath6 is presented , landau gauge fixing is performed and the gribov problem is analysed . in section 3 the gribov zwanziger local action",
    "is presented and a mathematical analysis of the value of the gribov parameter is presented . in section 4 a possible mechanism in order to obtain a gribov behaviour in a abjm type theory is presented .",
    "in three - dimensional minkowski space - time the lorentz group is @xmath7 ( instead of @xmath8 ) and the corresponding fundamental representation acts on a two components real spinor ( majorana ) .",
    "so to formulate the superspace , we started with the introduction of spinorial coordinates @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 ) that are transformed under @xmath11 . in the case of euclidean @xmath12 , the two components spinor",
    "shall be transformed under @xmath13 and as is well known @xcite one can not have the usual majorana condition .",
    "it s the same question we are in d = 4 @xcite . in the same way we follow the approach of generalizing the concept of complex conjugation of grassmann algebra @xcite .",
    "the notations and conventions are in appendix a.    in @xmath12 it is possible to add an additional gauge invariant term beyond the ym , the term cs @xcite , which is a topological mass term for the gauge field .",
    "thus the pure supersymmetry @xmath1 version of this action must have both terms .",
    "let us take the euclidean version of this superspace action of sym - cs @xcite : @xmath14 with , @xmath15 and @xmath16.\\label{eq : actionscs}\\ ] ] the field strength is given by : @xmath17 and superspace derivative : @xmath18    the supermultiplet of gauge fields is given by the components of the spinor superfield , in wess - zumino gauge : @xmath19 they belong to the adjoint representation of the gauge group su(n ) .",
    "the classical action for sym - cs theory , @xmath20 , remains invariant under the following gauge transformation @xmath21 with superspace covariant derivative : @xmath22      in order to quantize the theory correctly we have to fix the gauge and we can do covariantly using the usual procedure of faddeev - popov ( fp ) @xcite .    in the supersymmetric landau gauge",
    "we must implement the conditions @xmath23 . and following the usual procedure we ended with the action of gauge fixing @xmath24 where the faddeev - popov ghost fields will be scalar superfield . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the antighost and the ghost respectively . and @xmath27 is the brst nilpotent operator ( @xmath28 .",
    "the total action @xmath29 is invariant under the brst transformations @xcite : @xmath30 with @xmath27 carrying ghost number 1 .",
    "the ghost part of gauge fixing action becomes : @xmath31 with superspace covariant derivative given by ( [ superspacecovariantderivative ] ) :    in order to calculate the propagator for the gauge superfield @xmath32 , we need only the bilinear of s. so , for the bilinear part , we have : @xmath33 and using ( [ eq : epsoncontraction ] , [ eq : superderivativealfabetarelation ] , [ eq : realtionderivativecontraction ] , [ eq : d2squared ] ) : @xmath34 and for chern - simons : @xmath35\\\\   & = im\\int d^{3}xd^{2}\\theta\\left[\\gamma_{\\beta}^{a}d^{\\gamma}d^{\\beta}\\gamma_{\\gamma}^{a}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , with @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a gauge parameter to be set to zero after having evaluated the gauge propagator . using ( [ eq : superderivativealfabetarelation ] , [ eq : d2squared ] , [ eq : epsoncontraction ] , [ eq : realtionderivativecontraction ] ) and ( [ eq : superderivativealfabetaalfarelationzero ] ) , ( in landau gauge @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) we get the inverse @xmath41 so the massive gauge propagator for sym - cs : @xmath42      in the previous section we showed generally the quantization of sym - cs theory by faddeev - popov method .",
    "but one should be careful with this procedure . in the usual ym theory , although the gauge be fixed by the faddeev - popov method , gribov showed in @xcite that there are still field configurations obeying the landau gauge linked by gauge transformations , _",
    "i.e. _ there are still equivalent configurations , or copies , being taken into account into the feynman path integral . in other words , the gauge is not completely fixed and the remaining ambiguity is allowed due to the existence of normalizable zero - modes of the faddeev - popov operator , @xmath43 so we should investigate how this problem appears in the sym - cs case and its consequences . before we give a brief review of the ym case in d dimensions .      to address the problem of gribov copies ( eliminate these copies )",
    "gribov showed that the domain of integration of the functional integral should be restricted to a certain region @xmath44 , the so - called gribov region , that is defined as the set of field configurations performing the landau gauge condition , for which the faddeev - popov operator is strictly positive , namely @xmath45 its boundary , @xmath46 , where the first vanishing eigenvalue of the faddeev - popov operator shows up , is known as the gribov horizon .",
    "+ as in the region @xmath44 the faddeev - popov operator is positive than its inverse must diverge when approaching the horizon , due to the existence of a zero mode .",
    "so the restriction to the first gribov region is implemented requiring that @xmath47 which is the normalized trace of the ghost connected two point function in momentum space , has no pole for a given non vanishing value of the momentum @xmath48 , except for the singularity at @xmath49 , corresponding to the first gribov horizon . at @xmath50",
    "one can write @xmath51 from the above expression ( [ defregion ] ) , it follows that the no - pole condition at finite non vanishing @xmath48 is @xmath52 as @xmath53 decreases as @xmath54 increases one can also take @xmath55    in order to perform the restriction to the gribov region into the partition function , @xmath56 , the final step is to introduce the no - pole condition with the help of a heaviside function : @xmath57 where the euclidean @xmath58 yang - mills action in the landau gauge ( @xmath59 ) in d dimensions is given by : @xmath60    note that the only allowed singularity at ( [ eq : twopointghosparam ] ) is at @xmath61 , whose meaning is that of approaching the horizon , where @xmath62 is singular due to the appearance of zero modes of the faddeev - popov operator .",
    "thus we have to take @xcite : @xmath63 and thus the gribov parameter @xmath64 is fixed by the gap equation , which is , in the case of @xmath65 e.g. ,",
    "@xmath66    it is clear that the gribov approach is only the first step in order to consistently treat the problem of zero modes and the gribov copies in a gauge fixed yang - mills theory .",
    "the second step is the gz theory @xcite , which consists in a renormalizable and local way to implement the restriction to the first gribov region .",
    "in fact , zwanziger observed that the restriction could be implemented by adding the following term in the action ( [ ym ] ) : @xmath67 where , @xmath68 is the so - called horizon function , @xmath69^{ad}(x , y)f^{dec}a_{\\mu}^{e}\\,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 stands for the inverse of the faddeev - popov operator . in the zwanziger approach ,",
    "the parameter @xmath64 is fixed by the equation @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the euclidean space volume .",
    "it is clear that the horizon function is nonlocal , but it can be localized with the help of a suitable set of auxiliary fields . in order to ensure that those extra fields do not introduce extra degrees of freedom they are introduced in the form of a brst quartet @xmath73 where @xmath74 are a pair of complex commutating fields , while @xmath75 are anti - commutating ones .",
    "now , the local version of the gz action is then given by : @xmath76+\\int d^{d}x\\,\\bigl[\\,\\gamma^{2}gf^{abc}a_{\\mu}^{a}(\\varphi_{\\mu}^{bc}-\\bar{\\varphi}_{\\mu}^{bc})+dv(n^{2}-1)\\gamma^{4}\\bigl]\\,.\\label{localgz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term is a vacuum term permitted by power counting and required to obtain the gap equation ( [ gapgz ] ) by the condition that the vacuum energy , @xmath77 , be independent of @xmath78 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath79 where the @xmath80 , is defined by @xmath81e^{-s_{gz}},\\ ] ] and @xmath82 $ ] stands for the integration over all the fields .      as discussed in the introduction , this problem of gribov copies is a general property of all the local covariant renormalizable gauge fixing @xcite .",
    "and we explicitly have shown that gribov problem also exists in sym in landau gauge @xcite in @xmath83 .",
    "so let s investigate how this problem appears in the gauge fixing procedure of sym - cs theory .",
    "first we note that in the landau - gauge the gauge condition is not ideal .",
    "in fact if we consider two equivalents superfield , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , connected by a gauge transformation ( [ eq : gaugetransformation ] ) , if both satisfy the same condition of the landau gauge , @xmath23 and @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 therefore , the existence of infinitesimal copies , even after fp quantization is related to the presence of the zero modes of the operator above .",
    "this operator is the same that results in fp action ( [ eq : actionghost ] ) and so , if he has zero mode issue there are problem with functional generator @xmath88 this suggests that we should further restrict the functional integration to a region free of zero modes , and consecutively free of gauge superfields copies . to do this",
    "we would like to study the operator ( [ fpoperatorsusyini ] ) in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors equation , which is not immediate since the equation @xmath89 is not an eigenvalue equation , which can be seen in components .",
    "it relates the component at @xmath90 with to component @xmath91 of superfield @xmath92 .",
    "this indicates that the correct operator , where one can study the zero modes problem , and thus define the gribov problem is : @xmath93 this operator is the correct generalization of the fp operator of the supersymmetric fp operator that appears ( [ eq : actionghost ] ) . ] since the action ( [ eq : actionghost ] ) has an integral in @xmath91 .",
    "so to see the zero mode problem we take the eigenvalues equation @xmath94 so for configurations close to the vacuum @xmath95 and using ( [ eq : d2squared ] ) @xmath96 which has only positive eigenvalues @xmath97 , since the operator in question is hermitian .",
    "however as we go considering larger amplitudes than the vacuum , ie , @xmath32 sufficiently large , this can not be guaranteed and may be displayed negative eigenvalues .",
    "so we can consider the restriction of functional integration for the region free of zero modes of this operator , which will be the generalization of the gribov region ( [ definicao ] ) @xmath98    in order to implement this restriction then we consider the gz approach @xcite where is included in the functional integral the inverse of this operator ( horizon function ) in order to compensate the problem , this is formally @xmath99^{ad}(x , y)f^{dec}\\gamma_{\\beta}^{e}(y)\\;.\\label{hf1 - 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the next section we will put this horizon function in your local form and study some implications showing its consistency .",
    "the calculation of the field configurations that corresponds to the solutions of the gribov condition is an extensive work and requires further studies .",
    "to localize the horizon function ( [ hf1 - 1 ] ) we observe that we can get rid of the inverse of the fp operator with the aid of standard formula for gaussian integration and the introduction of a pair of spinor superfields of bosonic character and other fermionic , ending with @xmath100,\\label{eq : supergzaction-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there exists a freedom of redefinition of fields and we can perform a linear shift on the field @xmath101 in order to write the first two terms as a brst variation .",
    "this can be seen best by introducing of the auxiliary spinor superfields in the form of one quartet of brst : @xmath102    at this point is important for our construction to show the canonical dimension and ghost number of all fields and operators which are in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".quantum numbers of fields and operators . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     where the line between @xmath103 and @xmath104 corresponds to the zero order super ghost propagators @xmath105 .",
    "after a straightforward calculation : @xmath106    and we can define in momentum space , the one loop corrected ghost propagator as    @xmath107    according to diagram above . with @xmath108 given from ( [ eq : ghostpropagator1 ] ) .    using the feynman rules and d algebra from @xcite , ( and due @xmath109 ) : @xmath110 and after delta functions and d derivatives manipulations @xcite , we have : @xmath111 next we define : @xmath112 therefore , from ( [ eq : ghostpropzeroplusoneorder ] ) : @xmath113 re - summing the one - particle irreducible diagrams gives : @xmath114    now , as we are interested in the low momentum behavior we analyze the behavior of @xmath115 we get : @xmath116    according to the above discussion of the scenario of dominance of configurations on the gribov horizon , ie the ghost propagator ( the inverse of fp operator ) going to infinity , @xmath117 , we have to get the greatest value of the above integral witch is with @xmath118 as we can see in the integral graph shown in figure [ figintegral ] :     ( [ eq : integrald3equacaogapcomparametrodecs]),title=\"fig : \" ] [ figintegral ]    at this point is important to remember that also in the gribov procedure applied to non supersymmetric yang - mills it is necessary to analyse the greatest value of the integral @xmath119 . in the non supersymmetric yang - mills in @xmath83 we also take the integral at zero external momenta , which corresponds to the greatest value of the integral @xmath119 . it is easy to note in figure [ figintegral ] that the maximum value for the integral will be obtained at @xmath118 , as it can be seen in the graduated axis that corresponds to @xmath119 .",
    "so we should take @xmath120 and so we are able to define the one loop gap equation : @xmath121    thus the @xmath64 parameter is not independent , being defined as a function of the coupling constant g : @xmath122 it is clear that in close analogy to the gribov - zwanziger procedure @xcite it is also desired to work directly with the gap equation @xmath123 .",
    "it is well known that due to the fact that @xmath124 corresponds to the energy in the euclidean case , @xmath125 .",
    "it is necessary to break the supersymmetry explicitly in order to use this gap equation .",
    "the most simple way in order to do that is introducing a supersymmetry breaking term only which acts changing the value of the gribov parameter in the fermionic partners @xmath126 this term breaks the supersymmetry and introduces , at principle , two different mass parameters that can be associated to a gribov type behaviour .",
    "the original @xmath64 that appears in the gauge sector and the parameter @xmath127 in the fermionic sector .",
    "now , the equation @xmath123 is not trivial due to the fact that @xmath124 is not zero anymore but a function of @xmath64 and @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "now the derivation in @xmath64 corresponds to a filtration only in the gauge sector , i.e. in the sector in which the @xmath64 appear .",
    "it is important to note that due to the structure of the gribov propagator we have a gluino condensate given by @xmath129 , which corresponds to the term added to the fermionic action .",
    "thus the use of the gap equation permits to obtain the same integral condition as explained in the analysis of the ghost sector and used to obtain the value of @xmath64 .",
    "again it is important to note that this procedure is equivalent to a filtration on gauge - ghost sector . at the end in order to recover the supersymmetry we impose @xmath130 and obtain again the original propagator for the gluino sector , fixing the @xmath127 as the original value for this parameter that is obtained in the direct superfield formalism used in the construction of the gribov term in section 3 .",
    "of course this method is much more adequate in the case of non explicit supersymmetric construction of the gribov - zwanziger procedure which is not the case in this work .",
    "the only advantage of the method of breaking and restoring the supersymmetry is to note that only the sector of the energy functional that is derived from the gauge fields contributes in order to obtain the value of @xmath64 .",
    "the results will be the same as in the more simple method explained in these section .",
    "the behaviour of the gauge and gaugino correlators is the same as presented in @xcite . of course due to the construction directly in superfields of our gribov action",
    "it is not necessary the introduction , by hand , of the gribov term for the fermionic sector , like in @xcite .",
    "the price to pay for the explicitly supersymmetric construction is the need to look only to the ghost sector in order to fix the value of @xmath64 .",
    "in other terms , the explicitly superfield construction of the gribov action gave us the prove that only the gauge - ghost sector is fundamental for the gribov mechanism even in a supersymmetric action .",
    "now we will consider only the chern - simons sector . with interest in blg and abjm theories .",
    "many works about blg and abjm exists in the literature like @xcite and recently about brst breaking in abjm theory @xcite .",
    "so we would focus on the possibility of a replica model @xcite for confinement using the two chern - simons sectors of theories of that type . so considering only the chern - simons sector , we have that the ultraviolet mass dimension of gauge superfield @xmath84 becomes @xmath131 .",
    "in this case we rewrite the action ( [ eq : actionscs ] ) as @xmath132.\\label{eq : actionscs-1abjm}\\ ] ] as we are interested in n = 1 supersymmetric gauge field theory with the gauge group @xmath133 , we write a second action for another gauge superfield @xmath134 @xmath135.\\label{eq : actionscs-2abjm}\\ ] ] and we take the following total chern - simons action with matter : @xmath136 with the matter action given by @xmath137 with the matter superfield @xmath138 in the bi - fundamental representation of the gauge group , i.e the superspace covariant derivatives for matrix - valued complex scalar superfields @xmath139 and @xmath140 are defined by @xmath141 and @xmath72 is the potential term given by @xmath142.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the classical action ( [ eq : actionabjm ] ) remains invariant under the following gauge transformation @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are parameters of transformations .",
    "the gauge invariance of this theory reflects that the theory have some spurious degrees of freedom . in order to quantize the theory correctly",
    "we need to fix the gauge .",
    "and we can do with the faddeev - popov method already studied , ending with an action of gauge fixing for each superfield @xmath84 and @xmath134 , equation ( [ eq : actiongaugefix ] ) @xcite .    in terms of the field components",
    "this action can represents the gauge part of the abjm or blg : with gauge group @xmath146 , we can have a decomposition of blg theory ( it is possible to decompose the gauge symmetry generated by @xmath147 into @xmath148 ) and with @xmath149 , we can have abjm theory @xcite . in both cases we have , with @xmath150 , @xmath151 , with @xmath152 the chern - simons level .",
    "we know that the solution of the gribov problem for a chern - simons theory is trivial because the theory does not have metric @xcite .",
    "but now , in this case with two chern - simons interacting with bi - fundamental matter , we can have a spontaneous symmetry breaking such that insert a metric @xcite .",
    "this open a possibility of seeing gribov as a phase in abjm theory , what we started to investigate here .",
    "here we only consider the two chern - simons actions in a toy model .",
    "consider then the following mixing terms between the gauge fields .",
    "@xmath153 where @xmath154 has the dimension of mass .",
    "we expect it is possible to get this mass and mixing term through spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite . and first we will address the following total action ( levels @xmath152 and @xmath155 ) @xmath156 so we get for full bilinear part of this total action @xmath157\\nonumber \\\\ = & \\int d^{3}xd^{2}\\theta\\left[ik(\\gamma_{\\beta}^{a}d^{\\alpha}d^{\\beta}\\gamma_{\\alpha}^{a})-ik(\\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\beta}^{a}d^{\\alpha}d^{\\beta}\\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\alpha}^{a})+\\mu\\left(\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\gamma_{\\beta}^{a}\\gamma_{\\alpha}^{a}-\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\beta}^{a}\\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\alpha}^{a}+2\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\gamma_{\\beta}^{a}\\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\alpha}^{a}\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we get the propagators in momentum space of the type of ( [ eq : symcspropagatorgz ] ) @xmath158\\frac{d^{2}}{p^{2}}d_{\\beta}d_{\\alpha}\\delta^{2}(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{2})\\delta^{3}(x_{1}-x_{2}),\\nonumber \\\\ < \\gamma_{\\alpha}^{i}(1)\\gamma_{\\beta}^{j}(2 ) > & = & < \\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\alpha}^{i}(1)\\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\beta}^{j}(2)>,\\label{eq : abjmpropagator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and a mixing propagator @xmath159\\frac{d^{2}}{p^{2}}d_{\\beta}d_{\\alpha}\\delta^{2}(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{2})\\delta^{3}(x_{1}-x_{2}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the strong coupling regime ( taking @xmath160 ) this propagators have the pole of gribov type .",

    "so we obtain in this toy model at least two phases , one of which is confinement in gribov - zwanziger scenario .",
    "in this work we have studied the super - yang - mills chern - simons theory , n = 1 , considering the gribov problem present in ym theories as well as a generalization of the gribov - zwanziger approach with auxiliary superfields in superspace .",
    "a local supersymmetric gribov - zwanziger sector is presented providing the starting point in order to implement the restriction to the first gribov region beyond one - loop order . which results in propagators of the gribov type opening a perspective of treating confinement in these theories in terms of gribov - zwanziger scenario .",
    "and we note that gribov acts as a regulator for the usual infrared sym - cs theory , which can be observed from super propagator ( [ eq : symcspropagatorgz ] ) also a possible mechanism in order to obtain a gribov like propagator from a abjm theory is presented .",
    "it suggests that it is possible by making use of a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism similar to the one proposed in @xcite , which is under investigation .",
    "this mechanism can offer a possibility of seeing gribov as a phase in abjm theory , offering a link between confinement in gribov - zwanziger scenario and confinement as seeing by the brane scenario .",
    "we expect to study the implications of this relation in future works , specially the possibility of obtaining a condensate that can be associated to a usual particle in kllen - lehmann representation .",
