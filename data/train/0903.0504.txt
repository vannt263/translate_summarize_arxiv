    "( 2000 ) , see also conselice ( 2003 ) . in particular , we have extended the classical cas ( concentration / asymmetry / clumpiness ) parameter set by introducing a number of additional , suitably devised morphological indicators , using a final set of 10 parameters . a control sample of @xmath20 visually classified galaxies has been used to calibrate the whole set of morphological indicators , with the aim of identifying the best sub - set among them , as well as of analyzing how they depend on galaxy size , flattening and s / n ratio .",

    "this is the first time the morphological evolution in clusters can be investigated as a function of a proxy for the cluster mass , such as velocity dispersion or x - ray luminosity .",

    "spearman probabilities of a correlation are lower than 70% in all cases , and least square fits yield a practically flat best fit . on average , spirals are 23%@xmath32% of all galaxies , s0 galaxies represent almost half of the cluster population ( 44%@xmath33% ) and ellipticals are about a third with an average fraction of 33%@xmath347 .",

    "the evolution of the cluster @xmath0 s with redshift is irrelevant when assessing the morphological evolution . ] similarly , the average s0 fraction has changed from @xmath3515% for the least massive clusters , and from @xmath3522% for the most massive clusters , to @xmath37% in nearby clusters of all @xmath0 s . finally , the evolution of the average elliptical fraction for massive clusters is negligible , as noted by previous works ( eg .",

    "( see also the rightmost panel for the complementary passively evolving ( = non - emission - line ) versus early type comparison ) .",
    "the qualitative and , roughly speaking , also quantitative correspondence between spiral and star - forming fractions ( and , equivalently , early - type and passively evolving fractions ) is striking both for nearby and distant clusters .",
    "it is well known that not all early - type galaxies are passively evolving and not all spirals are star - forming , as testified by the ( small ) number of ellipticals and s0s with emission lines and the ( significant ) number of passive spirals observed in cluster spectroscopic surveys ( eg .",
    "dressler et al . 1999 , sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , the agreement in fig .",
    "1 indicates that , overall , the morphological evolution and the evolution in the proportion of star - forming galaxies have been very similar . in spite of the evidence that morphological transformations occur on a longer timescale than star formation changes ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) , this agreement suggests that a common physical cause is likely to regulate both on the long run . in this respect , it is interesting to note that `` morphology '' is more strongly affected by star formation , and depends more strongly on environment , than `` galaxy structure '' as measured for example by the sersic index , that mainly depends on galaxy mass ( van der wel 2008 ) .      finally , we analyze the morphological trends as a function of @xmath1 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the morphological evolution is similar to that observed for @xmath0 : at a given @xmath1 , distant clusters have higher spiral fractions , and lower s0 fractions , than local clusters .",
    "elliptical fractions are comparable at high- and low - z .",
    "interestingly , in contrast with the lack of correlation with @xmath0 , and in spite of the fact that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are considered tracers of cluster mass , we find that the spiral fraction is statistically anticorrelated with @xmath1 , with a spearman probability of 99.6% ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the best fit linear relation and its error computed using bootstrap resampling is @xmath39 .",
    "this confirms previous results that found similar trends between morphological fractions and @xmath1 ( bahcall 1977 , mchardy 1978 , edge & stewart 1991 ) .",
    "we note that our correlations are less steep with @xmath1 than in these previous works , possibly due to the fact that we limit our analysis to a fixed fraction of @xmath26 , while previous studies included all galaxies within a plate field - of - view .",
    "the results presented in this letter highlight two main issues that are central to understanding why galaxy morphologies change .    first , our findings demonstrate that morphological evolution does not occur exclusively in massive clusters , being actually more conspicuous in low mass clusters",
    ". this can be due either to `` secular '' galaxy evolution ( via processes intrinsic to each galaxy ) , or to one or more environmental processes that work preferentially in low - mass systems , or both in low- and high - mass systems .",
    "finding correlations of galaxy properties with global parameters like cluster mass , velocity dispersion or x - ray luminosity does not necessarily imply that environment at the epoch of observation is the agent of galaxy evolution .",
    "the principal cause could be ` secular , ' by which we mean that the evolution of morphology or star formation rests on some fundamental galaxy property / ies , such as galaxy mass , or galaxy matter density at such an early epoch as to be considered `` initial conditions . '' for example ,",
    "the epoch at which star formation will end and the galaxy s morphology evolve  the galaxy s internal clock  could be driven by the primordial density and mass of available gas , conditions that also correlate with the properties of the future global environment , such as the cluster @xmath0 that we have observed .",
    "in other words , initial conditions ( the `` primordial environment '' ) would predetermine individual galaxy properties , in a statistical sense .",
    "trends with global environments as those we observe would arise because the _ distribution _ of initial conditions varies systematically with global environmental properties , such as cluster mass .",
    "if , instead , environmental effects are directly inducing the morphological change close to the time we observe it , our results show that the processes must work effectively either in both low - mass and high - mass clusters , or preferentially in the low - mass cluster range of our sample , and/or perhaps also in groups with even lower masses than those considered here . in the case of environmental effects , the evolution of morphological fractions depends on @xmath0 because the average cluster growth history ( the history of accretion of other clusters , groups and isolated galaxies onto a cluster ) varies systematically with cluster mass ( poggianti et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "clearly , the constancy of the spiral , s0 and elliptical fractions with @xmath0 observed in wings at the present epoch can not continue to systems of even lower velocity dispersions all the way down to isolated galaxies , otherwise the morphological mix of the general field at low - z should be the same as in clusters , whereas it is markedly different .",
    "somewhere below @xmath40 the average fraction of spirals must break or slowly transition to the high fraction of spirals found in the low - density  field \" population . understanding the minimum cluster / group mass",
    "at which morphological transformations regularly take place is of course fundamental not only to identifying the relevant mechanisms at work , but also to assessing how many galaxies can be affected and how this fits in with the general cosmic evolution from star - forming / late - type to passive / early - type galaxies ; for example , van der wel .",
    "2007 find no significant evolution in the early - type galaxy fraction among field galaxies .    in this respect ,",
    "it is important to note that the limit of the wings survey , @xmath41 , corresponds to the observed break in the trend of star - forming fraction versus @xmath0 in sdss clusters at @xmath31 : above @xmath42 the fraction is flat with @xmath0 ( blue line in fig .  1 ) , while below the scatter becomes very large , with the average fraction possibly increasing towards lower velocity dispersions ( see figs .  4 and  6 in poggianti et al .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the morphological fractions in low @xmath0 systems continue to follow the trends of the star - forming fraction ( as they do above @xmath42 ) , and therefore to expect a large scatter and an increasing average spiral fraction beginning just below @xmath42 . if this is the case , and if the evolution is not secularly , but environmentally , driven , then some process is probably affecting galaxies in some , but apparently not all , groups",
    "this is consistent with the fact that , at all redshifts , groups are a very heterogeneous population , some having galaxy properties resembling massive clusters  low spiral and star - forming fractions ,  with others resembling the field ( p06 , jeltema et al .",

    "2008 , kautsch et al .",
    "2008 , wilman et al .",
    "2009 , poggianti et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", our result suggests that the candidate environmental mechanism(s ) should be one ( those ) that act efficiently and quite universally in clusters with @xmath43 , and probably in _ some _ , but not all , lower - mass clusters and groups .",
    "can be ruled out by the fact that the early - type / passive fraction in local clusters should then be much lower than observed ( fig .  16 in poggianti et al .",
    "neither tidal effects , nor processes related to the intra - cluster medium , can be easily ruled out at this stage ( see poggianti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and boselli & gavazzi ( 2006 ) for a discussion of the possible mechanisms ) .",
    "the second challenge for any acceptable evolutionary scenario is posed by the existence and lack , respectively , of a dependence of the spiral fraction on @xmath1 and @xmath0 in local clusters , described above .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath0 are rather well correlated for all local cluster samples including wings ( cava et al . 2009 ) , and both are considered rather good tracers of cluster mass , albeit with caveats .",
    "it is therefore surprising that the morphological distribution correlates at the 3@xmath0 level with @xmath1 , but not with @xmath0 .",
    "whether this is due to the way @xmath1 and @xmath0 differently trace the cluster mass , whether it is pointing to some residual trend with the properties of the intra - cluster medium ( @xmath1 ) on top of a more general evolution , or whether this is support for a secular mechanism where the correlation of properties does not imply a causal connection , is an open question .",
