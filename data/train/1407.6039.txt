    "it is commonly recognized that reconnection of the magnetic field lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) is of fundamental importance in the dynamics of various astrophysical objects , ranging from planetary magnetospheres to interstellar medium , as well as in the laboratory plasmas ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    a classical mechanism of the magnetic reconnection assumes its development from the null ( or `` neutral '' ) point , where all components of the magnetic field  @xmath0 disappear .",
    "( there are also some generalized models of reconnection which do not involve the null points at all , _",
    "e.g. _ , as discussed by @xcite ; but we shall not consider such models in the present paper . )    historically , the study of magnetic reconnection began from the 2d approximation , where the null points possessed a universal topology of x - type .",
    "however , starting from the mid 1990 s a considerable attention was paid also to the 3d case , where more diverse topological configurations are allowed ( _ e.g. _ , review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the simplest case of a potential magnetic field ,",
    "the structure of field lines in the vicinity of 3d null point can be pictorially presented as a collision of two oppositely - directed magnetic fluxes with subsequent outflow in the equatorial plane .",
    "this outflow ( or `` fan '' ) can be either axially symmetric ( which is called the `` proper radial null '' according to terminology by @xcite ) or asymmetric ( `` improper radial null '' ) .",
    "it was implicitly assumed in many works that the most typical case of the 3d null point , which can serve as a good initial approximation , is just the axisymmetric fan - type structure ( the proper radial null ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a few recent papers @xcite posed the problem of a `` generic '' 3d reconnection : they performed a numerical simulation of the magnetic fields whose initial configurations were substantially non - axisymmetric ( _ i.e. _ , represented the improper radial nulls ) .",
    "unfortunately , it remained unclear how important are such configurations from the statistical point of view ?",
    "in other words , how often do they appear in a random magnetic field ?    it is the aim of the present paper to provide a self - consistent calculation of the above - mentioned probabilities ( and , thereby , to give a justification for reasonable choice of the initial field configurations in studies of the 3d magnetic reconnection ) .",
    "a commonly - used approach to the analysis of the magnetic field structure in the vicinity of a null point is its expansion in taylor series in the cartesian coordinate system , whose origin is taken immediately in the null point : @xmath1 ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since the magnetic field  * b * must satisfy maxwell equations , elements of the matrix  * m * are mutually related . in general , this matrix can be described by four independent parameters ; see eq .",
    "( 14 ) in the above - cited paper by @xcite .",
    "it can be intuitively assumed that the larger is the number of the parameters involved and the greater are the domains of their definition , the larger will be the probability of realization of the respective field configuration .",
    "however , it is not so easy to justify this conjecture by using the representation  ( [ eq : taylor_expans ] ) : since elements of the matrix  @xmath2 are mutually related by maxwell equations , it is not clear how one should choose their joint probability distribution for the parameterization of the random field .    to get around this obstacle ,",
    "it is necessary to use an explicit solution of the relevant field equations ( _ e.g. _ , in terms of the spherical functions ) ; so that the respective coefficients can be chosen as independent random variables . in the present paper",
    ", such an approach will be performed for the case of potential ( current - free ) magnetic field .",
    "a similar analysis for the non - potential field involves a more cumbersome mathematics and , therefore , requires a separate paper .",
    "we shall consider _ random realizations _ of the potential magnetic field @xmath3 where the magnetic potential  @xmath4 satisfies the usual laplace equation : @xmath5 ( the potential field approximation is widely used , for example , in the solar physics , although it may be less relevant for treating the magnetospheric reconnection . )",
    "assuming the origin of spherical coordinate system  @xmath6 to be the spot of reconnection , solution of equation  ( [ eq : laplace_eduation ] ) can be written by the standard way as @xmath7 where @xmath8 \\label{eq : ball_func_reduced}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the spherical functions , and @xmath9 are the adjoint legendre polynomials .",
    "( the terms with negative powers of  @xmath10 are not taken into account because we are interested only in the nonsingular solutions . ) to avoid dealing with the infinite sum , it is convenient to assume that expression  ( [ eq : potential_general ] ) is cut off at a sufficiently large value of  @xmath11 and , therefore , contains only the finite number of terms  @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath12  is the dimensionality of the space of coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "the simplest case evidently takes place at @xmath40 or , in the original designations , @xmath41 then , these equations are reduced to the simple condition @xmath42 which has solutions of the two types : @xmath43 this represents a combination of the polar axis and a disk in the equatorial plane , _",

    "however , it should be born in mind that these constraints were formulated for the specific situation when `` spine '' of the `` fan '' was oriented exactly along the polar axis of the coordinate system used . in general ,",
    "such fan - like structure can be rotated in space by two euler angles , which effectively removes 2 constraints .",

    "it is convenient to reduce the above - mentioned system of equations to a single equation for the azimuthal angle  @xmath37 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55    ( a_1 \\zeta - b_1 \\eta ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! & & \\quad \\times \\big [ \\ ! - \\ !",

    "[ fig : function_f],width=287 ]    since formula  ( [ eq : def_fun_f ] ) represents a quite complex polynomial expression , the simplest approach to resolve our task is just to perform a statistical simulation : let us generate a sufficiently large sequence of random coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath48 , @xmath47 , and @xmath49 ( _ e.g. _ , as a gaussian distribution with a zero mean ) and then analyze behavior of the function  @xmath58 graphically ( figure  [ fig : function_f ] ) . surprisingly , it was found that the plot of  @xmath59 intersects the horizontal axis always in 3  points at the interval  @xmath57 $ ] ( and , consequently , in 6  points at the interval  @xmath60 $ ] ) .",
    "in fact , a subsequent careful analysis enabled us to get a rigorous mathematical proof of this fact .",

    "all other configurations ( in particular , the intuitively attractive axially - symmetric fan or more exotic geometric structures outlined in the old paper by  @xcite ) should emerge with a much less probability , because they are realized in the subsets of coefficients with lower dimensionality .",

    "[ fig : field_line_struct],width=257 ]    substituting expressions  ( [ eq : b_r(2)_simpl])([eq : b_phi(2)_simpl ] ) into  ( [ eq : field_eq_modif ] ) and performing the integration , we can easily find formulas for the magnetic field lines in three coordinate planes .",
    "for example , in the @xmath71-plane ( @xmath72 ) the final result will take the form : @xmath73 where @xmath74  is an arbitrary constant .",
    "behaviour of this function has three qualitatively different regimes , depending on the value of coefficient  @xmath48 :    * if @xmath75 or @xmath76 , then @xmath77 both at @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this evidently corresponds to the field line of hyperbolic type . * if @xmath80 , then @xmath77 at @xmath78 and @xmath81 at @xmath79 .",

    "this is also the field line of parabolic type but with the parabola axis oriented in @xmath84-direction .",
    "as regards the field lines in two other coordinate planes , they can be shown to have a hyperbolic structure in cases  ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "just this situation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : field_line_struct ] .",
    "furthermore , it can be proved that the same pattern of the field lines can be associated with all other cases mentioned above just by interchanging the role of various coordinate axes . using the terminology adopted in the theory of differential equations",
    ", one can say that the field lines have a node structure in one of the coordinate planes and the saddle structure in two other planes .",
    "let us emphasize that the six - tail arrangement of the magnetic field lines in the vicinity of a 3d null point is not a new finding : this configuration is well known from the earlier works , _",
    "e.g. _ , figure  1 in paper by @xcite or figure  5 in paper by @xcite ) , where it was called `` the improper radial null '' .",
    "however , it has not been recognized up to now that just this structure should play the dominant role in the 3d magnetic reconnection .    besides , the previously - used term `` improper '' looks somewhat misleading in the case that is actually the most typical .",
    "so , we prefer to call it `` the six - tail configuration '' .",
    "in fact , the purely geometric aspects of this structure may be studied more efficiently by the employment of taylor expansion in cartesian coordinates  ( [ eq : taylor_expans ] ) ; for more details , see section  iii in the above - cited paper by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our approach , based on the spherical functions , makes it possible to perform an accurate statistical parameterization of the random magnetic field and , thereby , to calculate the respective probabilities .",
    "it can be easily understood why probability of occurrence of the axially - symmetric fan - type structure ( left - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : various_structures ] ) should be substantially suppressed as compared to the six - tail structure .",
    "really , let us pay attention to the behavior of field lines in the @xmath71-plane of figure  [ fig : field_line_struct ] and assume that initially the value of parameter  @xmath48 corresponded to the case  ( c ) , as depicted in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : struct_transition ] .",
    "next , let @xmath48 gradually decrease and become negative , which refers to the case  ( b ) . from the geometric point of view",
    ", this corresponds to a gradual decrease in curvature of the field lines , and at some instant they become bent in another direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , the entire pattern remains parabolic but the parabola axis jumps by  @xmath85 ( right - hand panel in figure  [ fig : struct_transition ] ) .",
    "then , the boundary between these two cases is just the axially - symmetric fan - type structure , depicted in the central panel , which is realized at @xmath86 .",
    "-plane are drawn here ; the field lines in the @xmath70- and @xmath69-planes always remain of the saddle type .",
    "[ fig : struct_transition],width=287 ]    in other words , there are infinitely many six - tail configurations of types  ( b ) and  ( c ) but only one intermediate axially - symmetric fan - type configuration .",
    "so , the probability of its realization should be extremely small .",
    "( this picture is quite similar to figure  2 by  @xcite , who used the magnetic field parameterization in cartesian coordinates . )",
    "returning to figure  [ fig : field_line_struct ] , attention should be paid to the fact that six asymptotic directions of the magnetic field are quite different from each other .",
    "namely , four of them ( @xmath84 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 ) can be called `` dominant '' , because most of the field lines tend to approach one of these directions when they go away from the null point . on the other hand , two other asymptotic directions ( @xmath82 and @xmath90 )",
    "should be called `` recessive '' , because most of the field lines tend to depart from them .",
    "therefore , the recessive directions will be `` lost '' when observed from a large distance , and the entire pattern will look like a classical 2d x - point .",
    "this fact can explain why the 2d models of magnetic reconnection usually work rather well .",
    "for example , @xcite performed a numerical simulation of the solar flare presumably caused by a single null point and have found that the respective 3d reconnection actually proceeds in the quasi - two - dimensional slabs . the same reduction to a quasi-2d configuration was observed very clearly in our numerical simulations of bifurcation of the 3d null points in the solar atmosphere .",
    "we have calculated the probability of occurrence of various kinds of the 3d null points in a random magnetic field and studied the structure of field lines in their vicinity . as a result",
    ", it was found that :    1 .",
    "contrary to the intuitive expectations , the most likely case of the 3d null point , responsible for the magnetic reconnection , is the specific six - tail structure ( or `` the improper radial null '' , according to terminology by @xcite ) .",
    "all other kinds of the 3d null points , in particular , the intuitively attractive axially - symmetric fan ( or `` proper radial null '' ) are realized with much less probabilities , as schematically summarized in figure  [ fig : various_structures ] .",
    "3 .   at the sufficiently large distances , the generic six - tail structure",
    "is approximately reduced to a quasi-2d configuration of the well - known x - type , which explains why the 2d approach is often a good approximation for the magnetic reconnection .",
    "therefore , it may be conjectured that the specific 3d effects should be important , first of all , in the small - scale magnetic reconnection events ( _ e.g. _ , in the solar micro- and nano - flares ) .",
