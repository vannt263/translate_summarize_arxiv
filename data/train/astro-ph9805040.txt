    "here , we shall consider mainly the three well - known groups of chemically peculiar stars on the main - sequence of the hr diagram : fmam , hgmn ( non - magnetic ap or weak magnetic field ) , and magnetic ap stars .",
    "they show clearly abundance anomalies of metals with respect to solar abundances .",
    "these anomalies extend from factors of about 2 to 10 ( in am stars ) and up to some 10@xmath0 ( in ap stars ) .",
    "many abundance determinations have been done for a large number of ap and bp stars , covering a large sample of effective temperatures , for a large number of heavy elements .",
    "one of the most striking aspects of the observational results is the rather wide scatter of abundances determined in these stars for a given element ( see for instance takada - hidai 1990 ) .",
    "this scatter is partly due to errors in the abundance determinations and to inaccuracies in the effective temperatures determinations , but not only . despite this scatter ,",
    "a clear correlation with respect to the effective temperature is well established for some elements like mn ( see for instance smith and dworetsky , 1993 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that diffusion processes of elements provide the best explanation for cp stars anomalies .",
    "of course , microscopic diffusion interacts with other processes in stars , such as large scale motions ( convection , turbulence , wind ) and it can not be considered alone : the anomalies are the result of a complex stratification process involving all these motions .",
    "the diffusion model was first proposed by g. michaud ( 1970 ) , it is based on two basic findings : on the one hand , the abundance anomalies are related to atmospheric parameters like effective temperature and gravity , on another hand , there is a clear correlation between the superficial abundance anomalies and the radiative accelerations ( one of the main terms involved in the diffusion velocity ) in stellar external layers .",
    "the radiative accelerations are different according to the elements and they depend on atmospheric parameters .",
    "the anomalies which are found on main - sequence stars are not found among evolved stars , and this suggests that they are confined mostly to external layers .",
    "moreover , in the hr diagram , the cp stars are located where the stars outer convection zone is supposed to be the smallest .",
    "all of these arguments ( with some others which are not discussed here ) give a consistent outline for the diffusion model : when the stars evolve , the external layers are mixed with deeper ones and the abundance stratifications are lost .    in the diffusion model , the common property of the cp s is the weakness of the superficial helium abundance ( due to helium gravitational settling ) .",
    "this helium underabundance is supposed to lead to the decrease ( am stars ) or the disappearance ( hgmn and magnetic ap stars ) of the superficial convection zone .",
    "then , diffusion can occur in layers where stratification time scales are much shorter than in normal stars .",
    "diffusion is basically a time - dependent process . to determine what abundances",
    "can be observed at the stellar surface one needs to compute the stratification process which requires solving of the following continuity equation ( valid for test particles only , not for helium ) : @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the number density of the considered element ( and @xmath3 for ions ) , @xmath4 is a bulk velocity ( stellar wind for instance ) and @xmath5 is the velocity of ions with respect to protons .",
    "the continuity equation must be solved numerically because it is strongly non - linear with respect to @xmath2 ( see the study by alecian and grappin , 1984 , alecian , 1986 ) .",
    "the diffusion velocity @xmath6 depends on @xmath3 through the radiative acceleration @xmath7 .",
    "this equation is difficult to solve even in the stellar interior ( optically thick , in this case the radiative acceleration is easier to compute ) partly because the diffusion time scale at the bottom ( downward boundary ) is very different from the one at the top . on another hand , for am stars , the characteristic time of the stratification process in deep layers ( below the outer convection zones ) is often of the same order of magnitude than the time needed to the star s structure to evolve significantly and then , a detailed computation should take into account the changes of the internal structure .        for am stars , alecian ( 1996 )",
    "has solved numerically the continuity equation in the following form ( the non - linearities are kept ) : @xmath8 \\nabla",
    "c\\;-\\left\\langle d\\right\\rangle \\nabla ^{2}c\\;+\\;\\frac{1}{n_{p}}\\nabla \\left ( n_{p}\\sum\\nolimits_{i}c_{i}v_{ip}\\right ) = 0\\ ] ]    c is the element concentration , @xmath9 is the diffusion velocity of ions due to radiative acceleration and gravity .",
    "he has used an approximate formula for the radiative acceleration which is mainly valid for test particles . on another hand",
    ", he has neglected the effects of star s evolution on the main sequence and the feedback of element stratification on the stellar model .",
    "he has applied his method on calcium diffusion in am stars ( fig .",
    "these computations have shown that , according to some values of the mass - loss rate and thickness of the superficial mixing zone , ca could be overabundant in early phases of stratification ( see the comparison with observations by hui bon hoa , this meeting ) .    another kind of method has recently been developed by seaton ( 1997 ) .",
    "he has proposed a semi - numerical method based on a linearization of the continuity equation assuming @xmath10 .",
    "his method has the advantage to use very accurate radiative acceleration computations but the drawback is that his method can not be generalized to any element and to any star .",
    "the group of montreal ( michaud and collaborators , turcotte et al , 1998 ) has undertaken a very impressive task of computing the stratification process in a fully consistent way .",
    "the aim is to model the star , its evolution and structure , with detailed opacities ( using opal tables ) .",
    "the radiative acceleration is computed in details for many elements and at each time step , taking into account the changes of the detailed opacities due to abundance stratification of all these elements at a time .",
    "the continuity equation is solved numerically . presently , as in the previous method , @xmath10 , but this time on numerical grounds .",
    "this approach is certainly the most promising one , even if it is very heavy to carry out .      in the optically thin case ( for ap stars ) , the situation is much more problematic because radiation transfer , which can no more be solved locally , make the calculations too huge to be carried out ( at the moment ) : the continuity equation is coupled to the equation of the radiation transfer .",
    "some attempts have been done in the past to solve these coupled equations , but they were rather inaccurate ( alecian and vauclair 1981 , for silicon in ap stars ) .",
    "fortunately , interesting results can be obtained without the need to solve the continuity equation .",
    "this is the case , for example , for manganese by alecian and michaud ( 1981 ) : the diffusion model allows them to predict the maximum overabundance that can be observed in hgmn stars versus the effective temperature .",
    "this prediction is based on a quasi ``  zero order  '' approximation ( see below ) , and has been confirmed by the observations of smith and dwortesky ( 1993 ) .",
    "generally , the stratification in ap stars atmospheres is studied with some strong approximations .",
    "for instance , the ``  zero order  '' approximation consists in solving @xmath11 which supposes that the final concentration throughout the medium , is such that the diffusion velocity is zero everywhere ( for instance , alecian and artru 1988 , for gallium ) .",
    "a better approximation is to look for a steady state solution @xmath12 ( babel , 1992 ) .",
    "one problem is that one can not be sure that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are solutions of the continuity equation coupled with the transfert equation .",
    "another problem is to know what happens at the upper boundary ( babel , 1992 ) , above the photosphere .",
    "for instance , are the elements free to leave the atmosphere ( role of magnetic field , turbulence , etc . ) ?    despite these difficulties , we may try to have some guesses about the behavior of element stratifications in stellar photosphere ( see also alecian and grappin , 1984 ) . in fig 2 , we present a mental picture of what kind of stratification process could occur in the photosphere of an ap star .",
    "each window shows the same section of the photosphere at four successive stages ( t1 to t4 ) .",
    "the upper part of the atmosphere is denoted by @xmath15=0 ( optical depth ) , the bottom ( @xmath15=1 ) is the point where the medium becomes optically thick .",
    "let us consider an element a ( different from hydrogen and helium ) and assume that its atomic properties are well fitted to this mental experiment . at time",
    "t1 , concentration of a is assumed homogeneous throughout the atmosphere ( the decrease of the gray level represents the decrease of mass density assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ) . at time t2 , diffusion of a leads to form a cloud in the upper atmosphere ( remember that diffusion time - scale is shorter when proton density is smaller , then this cloud should appear first ) .",
    "this cloud is mainly supported by the photons coming from @xmath15=1 .",
    "now , if another cloud of element a forms ( at time t3 ) below the first one , this second cloud may act as a shield for photons supporting the upper cloud . then , the upper cloud is no more supported and falls .",
    "this scenario shows how stratifications built up by diffusion could be unstable in ap stars atmospheres .",
    "the time scale of such an instability phenomenon should be of the order of the diffusion time - scales in stellar atmospheres , i.e. around 10 to 10@xmath16 years .",
    "no hydrodynamics is involved in this scenario .",
    "if this scenario was confirmed by further theoretical studies ( they are presently in progress ) , it may contribute in explaining the scatter observed in ap stars abundances .",
    "we have shown that , at the moment , several works have been done to study the time - dependent diffusion in stellar envelopes .",
    "some of them are rather accurate but neglect hydrodynamics and are very heavy to carry out .",
    "another one is less accurate , but takes stellar mass - loss into account , and this is more realistic .",
    "self - consistent modelling , which will determine the evolution on the main - sequence of an am star ( including all known processes ) , is within the scope of the next few years . however , the studies on the stratification processes in ap stars atmospheres are still embryonic .    in the long run , the goal would be to perform a fully self - consistent modelling ( including hydrodynamics ) of the envelope together with the atmosphere .",
    "this seems to be the only way to answer all the questions raised by observations .",
