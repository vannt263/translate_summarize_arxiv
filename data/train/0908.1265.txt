    "statistical ( microcanonical ) entropy @xmath0 is the logarithm of the number of distinct microstates @xmath1 of a system consistent with some imposed macroscopic properties , such as a restriction on the total energy .",
    "thus , the entropy @xmath0 is proportional to the logarithm of the dimensionality of the hilbert space of allowed @xmath1 s and measures the amount of information that is encoded in a particular microstate @xmath1 .",
    "unitarity forbids any change in the size of this hilbert space during time evolution of the system , but entropy may increase if the macroscopic description changes so that more microstates become consistent with it .    without a theory of quantum gravity ,",
    "we do not know , so can not count , the microstates of black holes ( for results in string theory , see @xcite ) .",
    "but it has been established @xcite semiclassically that a large black hole of mass @xmath2 emits thermal radiation of temperature @xmath3 , so the entropy in this hawking radiation is of order the area of the hole : @xmath4 ( we use planck units @xmath5 throughout ) . strictly speaking",
    ", the hawking process applies only to the semiclassical part of the evaporation , but the final quantum part releases at most of order the planck energy , which can be made negligible compared to the initial mass of the hole and is thus unlikely to change the scaling with @xmath2 of the total amount of radiation entropy",
    ". a total black hole entropy of @xmath6 , corresponding to an entropy density @xmath7 on the horizon , is consistent with other evidence ranging from black hole thermodynamics @xcite to string theory @xcite , although there are other interpretations of this area entropy as well @xcite .",
    "a black hole has much more entropy than ordinary matter configurations of the same size @xcite and energy .",
    "for ordinary matter in flat space , the following bound @xcite applies : @xmath8 .",
    "this result can be derived as follows .",
    "given a thermal region of radius @xmath9 and temperature @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 and @xmath12 . requiring @xmath13 ( using the hoop conjecture  a criterion for gravitational collapse @xcite ) then implies @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the use of a temperature @xmath10 in this derivation is justified because the entropy of a system of fixed size and total energy is maximized in thermal equilibrium .    in planck units , and for macroscopic objects",
    ", the gap between @xmath16 and @xmath17 scaling is prodigious .",
    "part of the motivation for the work described here was to understand whether this gap in scaling could be closed by considering curved , rather than flat , space .",
    "another related question , also addressed below , is whether black holes are the most entropically dense objects in the universe . the answers to these questions",
    "are ( at least in classical general relativity ) : yes , non - black hole configurations can be found which have more than @xmath17 entropy , although such configurations are very non - euclidean , and no , black holes are not the most entropic objects of fixed surface area and mass , unless some further principle ( presumably of quantum nature ) is introduced into the theory to remove even higher entropy configurations .",
    "the highly entropic objects we have found all collapse into black holes , which is problematic if black hole evaporation is unitary , since unitary evolution can not map a larger hilbert space into a smaller one .",
    "( of course , it is also possible that black hole evaporation violates unitarity @xcite . )",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "we present two examples of classes of such highly entropic configurations @xmath18 ( matter+gravity ) . in both examples ,",
    "the curvature of space on @xmath18 makes the adm mass ( i.e. , the energy a distant external observer sees and that determines the black hole area after collapse and hence the eventual hawking radiation entropy ) and the surface area of the configuration much smaller than would be suspected from the proper internal volume , to which the initial entropy @xmath19 is proportional . in the case of `` _ monsters _ '' ( sect .",
    "[ monsterssubsection ] ) , this effect can be ascribed to large negative binding energy @xcite which almost cancels the proper mass to yield a relatively small adm mass . in sect .",
    "[ frwsubsection ] , the kruskal ",
    "frw example , the reason is the non - monotonic behavior of the radius @xmath20 of 2-spheres across the outer einstein - rosen bridge .    unlike ordinary configurations such as stars , galaxies , or even black holes , monster - like configurations have unbounded entropy at fixed adm mass and surface area : even if we force the spacetime to be asymptotically flat and fix its adm mass at @xmath2 and if , moreover , we require all excited matter degrees of freedom to be contained within a 3-sphere of fixed surface area @xmath16 ( this definition is unambiguous in the case of spherical symmetry , which our examples will obey ) , there are still an infinite number of matter+gravity configurations inside this surface which conform to these restrictions .",
    "in fact , imagine that , additionally , the 3-geometry ( at some instant in time , e.g.  at a moment of time symmetry ) inside the sphere is fixed and that one only looks for matter configurations which generate this given geometry ( via the einstein constraint equations of classical general relativity ) ; then the entropy @xmath0 characterizing these matter configurations _ alone _ is already unbounded as one varies the 3-geometry inside the surface @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ smfig ] ) .",
    "the stationary points of @xmath0 as a function of the 3-geometry correspond @xcite to solutions of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation ( i.e. , they are stationary stars , etc . ) , but for some interior 3-geometries the entropy @xmath0 can be much bigger and be even larger than @xmath16 or @xmath21 ( typically , the configuration will not be stationary in this case ) .",

    "( b ) the monster s future time evolution is similar to ordinary gravitational collapse : ( almost ) all matter and entropy , if it was not already initially , will fall behind a horizon ( infall of outer layers soon creates trapped surfaces ) and form a black hole which then evaporates , radiating away entropy @xmath34 past the external observer to future infinity @xmath35.[monsterfig],width=451 ]    now , consider a semiclassical configuration ( `` monster '' @xcite , fig .",

    "it is now evident that , if @xmath47 is constant , one can always find configuration parameters @xmath48 such that the entropy of the monster exceeds area scaling ( hence , the name ) .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , if we model the matter ( initially ) as a perfect fluid with equation - of - state parameter @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath50 , and we would just have to choose @xmath51 for a photon gas ( @xmath52 ) or @xmath53 for dust ( @xmath54 ; we assume the dust particles carry some kind of label or have spin ) .",
    "[ monsterfig](b ) depicts the time evolution of a monster , which resembles ordinary gravitational collapse .",
    "the main difference is that , due to our construction , the entropy @xmath19 on the initial cauchy slice can be much bigger than the entropy @xmath55 on future infinity , assuming that black hole evaporation is unitary and the standard assumptions about hawking radiation hold . in order to preserve unitarity ( or the ads / cft duality @xcite )",
    "one would somehow have to excise monsters with @xmath56 from the hilbert space .",
    "monsters with sufficiently high entropy are therefore semiclassical configurations with _ no _ corresponding microstates in a quantum theory of gravity .",

    "furthermore , bousso s covariant entropy bound @xcite holds in the semiclassical monster spacetime since it falls under the general class of spacetimes for which a general theorem @xcite applies ( this assumes no large entropy gradients due to , e.g. , shockwaves during evolution , which seems plausible , but has not been proven ) .      the second example @xcite consists of slices of closed frw universes which are glued together across einstein - rosen bridges , eventually connecting to a large asymptotically flat universe ( fig .",

    "the ( measurement - theoretic ) notion of the _ trace - norm _ is required , which can be used to characterize the distance between two mixed states @xmath115 and @xmath114 : @xmath116 this sensibly quantifies how easily the two states can be distinguished by measurements , according to the identity @xmath117 where the supremum runs over all observables @xmath118 with operator norm @xmath119 smaller than 1 ( projectors @xmath120 are in some sense the best observables , all other observables can be composed out of them , and they have @xmath121 ) . note that the trace on the right - hand side of ( [ tracesup ] ) is the difference of the observable averages @xmath122 evaluated on the two states @xmath115 and @xmath114 , and therefore specifies the experimental accuracy necessary to distinguish these states in measurements of @xmath118 .",

    "conversely , for almost all pure states @xmath1 any small subsystem @xmath99 will be found to be extremely close to perfectly thermalized ( assuming the constraint @xmath9 on the whole system was an energy constraint ) .",
    "as mentioned , the overwhelming dominance of `` typical '' states @xmath1 is due to the geometry of high - dimensional hilbert space and the resulting concentration of measure .",
    "it is a consequence of kinematics only  no assumptions have been made about the dynamics .",
    "almost any dynamics ",
    "i.e. , choice of hamiltonian and resulting unitary evolution of @xmath1  leads to the system spending nearly all of its time in typical states for which the density matrix describing any small subsystem @xmath99 is nearly thermal @xcite .",
    "typical states @xmath1 are maximally entangled , and the approach to equilibrium can be thought of in terms of the spread of entanglement , as opposed to the more familiar non - equilibrium kinetic equations .",
    "we can restate these results in terms of the entanglement entropy of the subsystem @xmath99 , thereby making contact with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the entanglement entropy is simply the von neumann entropy of @xmath115 : @xmath126 using the same results on the concentration of measure , it can be shown @xcite that , for the overwhelming majority of pure states @xmath1 , @xmath127 is extremely close to its maximum value @xmath128 : @xmath129   \\leq \\exp \\left ( -   \\frac{(d_x d_e - 1 ) c \\alpha^2}{(\\log d_x)^2 } \\right)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "the second law is seen to hold , in a probabilistic sense , even though the underlying dynamics is time - reversal invariant : density matrices @xmath115 with small entropy are highly improbable , and if @xmath99 is found in a low - entropy state , the entropy is more likely to increase than decrease over any macroscopic time interval .    in our earlier discussion of monsters ,",
    "the entropy we used was not the entanglement entropy @xmath127 in ( [ entanglemententropy ] ) .",
    "instead , we defined the entropy of a monster or black hole to be the logarithm of the number of distinct quantum states consistent with the imposed macroscopic conditions ( e.g. , fixed adm mass @xmath2 , object of area @xmath16 ) .",
    "this entropy is directly proportional to the logarithm of the dimensionality of the hilbert space consistent with the macroscopic description , so in the current discussion it is simply @xmath128 if we consider only the subset of @xmath99 configurations which are consistent with the description . note that @xmath132 and that , for typical pure states of the larger system , any subsystem @xmath99 will have entanglement entropy @xmath127 near its maximum value @xmath128 .",
    "thus , within the framework for statistical mechanics discussed in this section , the entropy we defined earlier can be used to characterize the most likely ( `` equilibrium '' ) configurations to be found in @xmath99 .",

    "for example , can we deduce the second law of thermodynamics on semiclassical spacetimes ( i.e. , including , for example , large black holes ) ?",
    "this might seem overly ambitious since we currently lack a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "however , the results described above are primarily a consequence of the high - dimensional character of hilbert spaces .",
    "if the state space of quantum gravity continues to be described by something like a hilbert space , then its dimensionality will almost certainly be large , even for systems of modest size .",
    "further , it seems a less formidable task to characterize some aspects of the state space of quantum gravity than to fully understand its dynamics .",

    "this description of the state space seems quite plausible , at least in a coarse grained sense , even if the fundamental objects of the underlying theory are something else ( strings , loops , etc . ) .",
    "let us assume that some form of short - distance regulator is in place ( or , alternatively , that the dynamics itself generates such a regulator in the form of a minimum spacetime interval ) , so that we can neglect ultraviolet divergences .",
