    "the modeling of the dust and gas emissions of cometary nuclei requires linking physical and chemical processes ranging from the formation and release of molecules to the emission of macroscopic particles , driven by solar radiation and gravitational forces .",
    "advanced models relating gas emission and subsequent acceleration of dust grains from the surface layer of a comet have been developed over the years ( @xcite ) , but the detailed mechanism for dust - jet formation is not well understood @xcite .",
    "space - craft observations starting with the halley flyby 1986 reveal complex jet / filament structures near the cometary nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rosetta mission ( @xcite ) observations cover several months of imaging the activity of comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko ( 67p / c - g ) and have started to release images captured with its navigation cameras ( navcam ) , revealing dust jets originating from the surface ( @xcite ) .",
    "compact dust particles originating from 67p / c - g with sizes from @xmath0 to @xmath1  mm and fluffy dust aggregates ( sizes @xmath2 to @xmath3  mm ) have been registered with the grain impact analyzer ( giada ) instrument on esa / rosetta ( @xcite ) and give typical dust velocities in the range of @xmath4 to @xmath5  m / s from august  2014 to january  2015 at the rosetta distance from the nucleus ( @xmath6  km ) .",
    "the collimation of dust particles into jets has been previously linked to surface structures by either introducing isolated areas of cometary activity with respect to gas emission ( `` spots '' ) ( @xcite ) , topographical features such as pits and floors of craters ( @xcite ) , or terraced regions ( @xcite ) .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] we propose a different collimation mechanism based on the assumption of a homogeneous surface activity with dust emitted along the surface normal .",
    "the model puts strong constraints on the origin of the dust particles .",
    "we obtain the global dust distribution within several cometary radii without introducing additional parameters or localized sources of gas and dust emission . a detailed topographical model of the comet",
    "is required to account for the concave terrain .",
    "the collimation and formation of dust jets in the homogeneous activity model result from the convergence of trajectories originating from concave areas .",
    "in addition , comparison with rosetta images reveals the importance of cometary rotation , which causes a velocity dependent bending of jets due to the coriolis effect .",
    "the coriolis effect allows one to infer the absolute dust velocity and to rule out scenarios of dust emitted with zero initial velocity from the surface .",
    "the tenuous gas atmosphere around the comet further accelerates emitted dust , but is not the cause of the jet formation .",
    "the dust jets are robust over variations of four orders of magnitude of the gas - dust interaction .",
    "we start by modeling the gas density and velocity field around the comet within a simple model satisfying the equation of continuity for an expanding gas cloud . in the second step ,",
    "we consider the emission of homogeneously distributed dust grains from the cometary surface and demonstrate a mechanism for collimated dust jets despite uniform emission .",
    "in contrast to previous models of cometary jets , we fully incorporate the rotation and shape of 67/c - p by working with a detailed topographical model of the nucleus .",
    "the surface topography is directly imprinted in the dust distribution around the nucleus and comparison of model with rosetta images allows one to conclude that dust is leaving the surface with a non - zero velocity already acquired within the outer mantle .",
    "it is then directed on average along the surface normal .",
    "in addition the coriolis force results in the bending of jets and puts strong constraints on dust velocities to be consistent with the observations of curved jets from 67p / c - g . in sect .  [ sec : rosetta ] we incorporate insolation conditions on the surface and take the position of the rosetta spacecraft into account to compare column densities obtained from the model with rosetta navcam images .",
    "jet - like structures are reproduced at locations seen in the navcam images and the comparison of model and observation allows one to determine the dust velocity in addition to verify the proposed collimation mechanism .",
    "the model itself is evaluated efficiently on massively parallel processors ; a complete implementation is provided online .",
    "modelling radiation - driven activity of comets requires setting up a three - dimensional model of the physical ( temperature , density / porosity , gas / solid phase ) and chemical properties ( molecular reactions ) throughout the nucleus and coma ( @xcite ) . in computational fluid dynamics approaches ,",
    "the nucleus is subdivided into volumetric cells and the diffusion and heat equations are solved ( @xcite ) . the dust is subsequently embedded into the gas - model and accelerated by gas drag within the porous mantel and outside the cometary body .",
    "the gas eventually disperses in lateral directions and the gas density falls of as @xmath7 with increasing distance @xmath8 , while solid dust grains remain compact particles under the influence of external forces .    for the homogeneous activity model , we start by computing the gas density and gas velocity field around the nucleus and subsequently consider the dust motion under gas drag .",
    "since cometary activity is largely thermally driven , differences in gas and dust production between the night and day sides of the comet are expected .",
    "our aim is to model the dust distribution , which is linked to the gas release inside the comet . in a first approximation",
    ", we consider the day / night hemispheres as completely active / inactive areas for the dust . for simplicity",
    ", we consider gas emanating around the whole comet . to obtain a homogeneous sampling of the comet with respect to the number of emitted particles ( either dust or gas molecules )",
    "we employ a surface mesh with equal - area mesh - cells .",
    "this approach has advantages for an efficient parallelization of the required computations .",
    "our starting point is the triangular surface mesh of the comet with detailed three - dimensional topography , including concave areas .",
    "since no shape model of 67p / c - g has been published yet , we use a remeshed model based on the higher resolution model obtained by m.  malmer  ( @xcite ) based on rosetta - navcam pictures .",

    "the lateral expansion of gas is accounted for by a subsequent gaussian convolution , and the mixing of gas stemming from different regions of the concave object by a binning and averaging of the velocity direction of @xmath37 position and velocities .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gasdensitymap ] for the gas velocity @xmath41  m / s .      in the next computation step ,",
    "we obtain the dust dynamics within the expanding gas cloud .",
    "the dust trajectories are obtained by integrating @xmath42 which includes the acceleration of dust embedded in the more rapidly expanding gas .",
    "the gas - drag acceleration depends on the dust - particle mass @xmath43 and radius @xmath44 , as well as on the momentum of the gas molecules .",
    "if we take @xmath45 ( @xcite ) and insert the gas velocity from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gasvel ] ) we obtain an overall factor @xmath46 for the gas - dust interaction @xmath47 in the following we vary @xmath46 by five orders of magnitude by altering the gas density in the range @xmath48  m@xmath19 for dust particles of size 1  @xmath49 m and dust density @xmath50  kg / m@xmath51 .",
    "equivalently , the parametric study corresponds to changes in the gas temperature , or / and the particle size and mass over an equivalently wide range .",
    "in addition to the gas drag encountered by dust outside the nucleus , different scenarios for acceleration of dust already in the outer mantle of the nucleus have been considered by @xcite , chapter  3.4 , who model dust flow and acceleration in the pores of the mantle . in this case , dust is ejected out of the nucleus with finite initial velocity , gained within less than a meter .",
    "one direct consequence of the final initial velocity model is that the local topography of the cometary surface is reflected in the initial velocity direction , which is then expected to be ( on average ) along the surface normal .",
    "if on the other hand the initial dust velocity on the surface is taken to be zero as suggested by @xcite , no surface normal direction is imprinted in the dust field .",
    "as we demonstrate next , only the finite initial - velocity model leads to jet formation from a homogeneous surface - emission of dust . the homogenous dust emission is implemented by assigning one dust particle to each center of the equally - sized triangles of the surface mesh .",
    "three different dust - velocities are considered , @xmath52  m / s .",
    "the direction of the non - zero velocity cases is pointing along the surface normal of each triangle .",
    "it is instructive to study the relative contribution of the different terms contained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : accdust ] ) for the specific case of 67p / c - g .",
    "we consider as exemplary particle a dust grain emitted from the almost flat surface of the big lobe of the comet moving in the gas field ( @xmath18  m@xmath19 , @xmath53  m / s ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gasdensitymap ] .",
    "the velocity and position of the dust particle are determined by the gas drag , the coriolis effect , gravitational and centrifugal forces , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forces ] along the trajectory .",
    "while the influence of gas drag drops rapidly with increasing distance , the rotation of the comet has a large influence on the dust trajectories through the velocity - dependent coriolis effect . for 67p / c - g the rotation of the nucleus",
    "can not be neglected as was done in previous studies in view of the small relative value of the centrifugal force ( @xcite ) .",
    "if only the coriolis force is present , the motion of a particle with its velocity vector pointing radially outward in the plane orthogonal to the rotation axis follows a circle with radius @xmath54 the navcam observations allow one to determine @xmath55 and to validate the dust model discussed here , see sect .  [ sec : coriolis ] .",
    "a direct comparison with rosetta observations requires considering the solar illumination condition and spacecraft position with respect to the comet .",
    "we construct a directional sunlight model using the sun - comet vector obtained from the horizon ephemeris file of the heliocentric position of the comet .",
    "the shape model is then rotated to align the rotation axis with the pole location in tab .",
    "[ tab : cometprop ] .",
    "any precession of the rotation axis or change in rotation period due to torque acting on the comet is neglected . for the given day of the observation",
    "we rotate the shape model around its rotation axis to match the light conditions of the navcam image frames published in @xcite , for which no exact time stamp information is given .",
    "the published navcam images have been processed by esa to enhance the visibility of dust and jet structures . for a direct comparison ,",
    "we compute the comet shadow on itself and the shadow on emitted dust particles . in addition",
    ", we use a sunlight - driven activity model for dust emission and remove all dust trajectories that originate from shadowed surface cells .",
    "this simplified model neglects border effects at the day / night terminator and thermal inertia , leading to a prolonged activity in previously illuminated areas .",
    "for the demonstration of the collimation effect , this simplified activity model suffices in the vicinity of the nucleus where dust spends about 1  h ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : forces ] ) , compared to the cometary rotation period of 12  h.      to compare the dust model with rosetta navcam observations of 67p / c - g we obtain the dust column density along the camera direction extending @xmath38  km from the center of the nucleus .",
    "we use two equivalent methods to show the column density : in fig .",
    "[ fig : may12 ] , left column , we display the binned dust density in a grid with cell sizes @xmath56  km@xmath57  km@xmath58  km , where the @xmath59  km axis is oriented along the navcam view direction , and show for comparison the dust density along a slice through the center of the comet .",
    "alternatively , a linear superposition of point clouds taken at equidistant time - intervals and represented by finite - sized pixels yields the column density shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : may12 ] and [ fig : comet20042015 ] .",
    "the latter method provides a phase - space portrait of the velocity field around the nucleus at various positions .",
