    "the cosmic star formation rate ( csfr ) at high redshifts is a key probe to determine the time - table of structure formation in the universe and hence to further constrain cosmology .",
    "number counts of galaxies only give access to small parts of the sky and are subject to severe selection effects depending on the wavelength range of the observational campaign such as , for example , extinction by dust using deep photometry in the optical .",
    "furthermore , absolute sky photometry is biased due to galactic foregrounds making it difficult to assess truly diffuse extragalactic background light ( ebl ) which could arise due to the decay of unstable relics from the early universe .",
    "therefore , an independent method unaffected by these obstacles is required , and we suggest along with salamon & stecker ( 1998 ) and primack et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to use the attenuation of gamma rays from distant quasars for this purpose .",
    "egret has detected that many flat - spectrum radio quasars at high redshifts emit gamma rays at least up to 10  gev showing generally no indication for a spectral break .",
    "a few nearby flat - spectrum radio sources have even been detected up to tev ( @xmath0  ev ) energies using ground - based cherenkov telescopes suggesting that at least some of the sources exhibit smooth power - law spectra in the gev - to - tev energy range .",
    "the gamma rays of energy @xmath1 can interact with ambient low - energy photons of energy @xmath2 creating electron - positron pairs provided the threshold energy @xmath3 is exceeded . as a result",
    ", the gamma ray sources should show a cutoff in their spectrum at the energy where the mean free path for pair creation becomes shorter than the distance to the sources , i.e. where @xmath4d_z\\ge 1 $ ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes the photon number density of the ebl , and @xmath7 is the cosmological distance of the gamma ray source . generally ,",
    "since the number density of background photons increases with decreasing photon energy , and thus increasing gamma ray energy above threshold , the more distant gamma ray sources must show lower cutoff energies than the closer gamma ray sources and the precise running of the cutoff energies with redshift will tell us about the shape and evolution of the ebl .",
    "our strategy now is to develop a simple model for the redshift - dependent ebl based on the observed ( and extinction - corrected ) csfr and then to determine the corresponding values of gamma ray cutoff energies .",
    "we start with a description of the galaxy evolution templates used to determine the ebl when folded with the csfr , and proceed with the computation of the gamma ray optical depth .",
    "finally , we discuss that possible deviations of future measurements of the gamma ray cutoff energies would require changes in the ebl model ( e.g. in the csfr ) or force us to consider additional sources to contribute to the ebl .",
    "we use the spectral synthesis model calculated by mller et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which describes the evolution of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a single burst population ( ssp ) with time ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the stars have solar metalicity and salpeter imf .",
    "we simplify the temporal evolution by reducing it to only two spectral states .",
    "the first state lasts from ignition to an age of 0.28 gyrs .",
    "we call this state the _ early phase _ and it is dominated by the ultraviolet and optical radiation of young massive stars . the second state is defined to begin at an age of 0.28 gyrs .",
    "we call this state the _ late phase _ and it is dominated by the optical and infrared light of the older stars in the population . to get the spectrum representative for each phase",
    "we calculate the corresponding mean sed from the templates .",
    "note that the late phase lasts over a cosmologically significant portion of time and therefore must be weighted with the csfr .",
    "furthermore , we include the effect of the interstellar medium ( ism ) by assuming an isotropic and homogeneous gas and dust distribution around the stars of the ssp .",
    "we use osterbrook s case b for optical thick gas clouds , i.e. total absorbtion of photons below the wavelength of 911  and reemission of the absorbed power in the optical regime by bremsstrahlung and @xmath8 line emission .",
    "the dust is treated the same way as in desert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) considering a three component model with big grains , small grains and pah s .",
    "for the absorbtion we use an extinction curve similar to the one of the smc .",
    "the reemission is described by four planck spectra with two temperatures for each phase reprensenting warm and cold dust components .",
    "the resulting spectra including absorbtion and re - emission are shown in figure  [ figneu ] .",
    "now let us look at galaxy evolution on global scales . in our model , the stars in galaxies",
    "are all represented by ssps .",
    "so far we did not include a particular star formation rate , and we will do this now by using the cosmic star formation rate ( csfr ) as determined from galaxy counts in the optical ( e.g. , madau 1996 ) .",
    "since dust and gas absorbs optical photons , the original madau csfr underestimates the true sfr in particular at high redshifts by at least a factor of @xmath9 ( pettini et al .",
    "1998 ) or maybe even @xmath10 ( steidel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "all data agree , however , in a csfr increasing up to a redshift @xmath11 and decreasing at @xmath12 , see fig .",
    "we adopt in the following a power - law fit to this csfr shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] @xmath13 with @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",

    "the emissivity @xmath22 is plotted for three different wavelengths demonstrating satisfactory agreement . note that in particular the steeper increase at 0.28 @xmath23 m and the more shallow increase at 1.0 @xmath23 m are well reproduced by the model .    .choosen",

    "the ebl decreases because of the decreasing csfr and the expansion of the universe .",
    "the shape of the spectrum at high redshifts is determined by the _ early phase _ spectrum , whereas for lower redshifts the _ late phase _ becomes more and more important .",
    "this is a consequence of of the maximum star formation rate at redshifts @xmath27 from which the stellar populations have considerably aged until the present .",
    "there are no direct measurements of the ebl at high redshift ( with the exception of inferences of the uv background based on the proximity effect which are consistent with our model predictions if we employ empirical power law extensions of the uv spectra beyond the lyman edge ) .",
    "we can , however , compare our results with the present - day data obtaining good agreement as shown in fig .",

    "future gamma ray observations with ground - based air cherenkov telescopes in the energy range 10  gev to 10  tev can efficiently probe the run of the csfr with redshift .",
    "e.g. , the faster the decrease above the maximum of the csfr ( the larger the slope @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , the less attenuation occurs for quasars at redshifts @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "a plateauish csfr combined with the effect of dust keeps the uv radiation density low at high redshifts , but leads to a strong fir bump in the ebl which leads to strong attenuation of @xmath33 10 tev gamma rays from nearby @xmath34 radio sources .",
    "in order to facilitate a comparison of gamma ray cutoff energies in the spectra of high - redshift quasars with theoretical predictions of gamma ray attenuation due to pair creation , we developed a simple model for the evolving ebl based on the observed csfr taking into account extinction and re - emission by dust and gas .",
    "further model inputs are the imf , the average metalicity , relative contributions of warm and cold dust to the emission of early- and late - type galaxies , and the hubble constant for which we have adopted values in close agreement with observations .",
    "the csfr at high redshifts is not accurately determined by the data , and we have tried to use a value which is consistent with both the present - day ebl and high - redshift galaxy counts .",
    "so far we have neither considered the extension of the galaxy spectra beyond the lyman edge , the metalicity dependence of galaxy spectra , nor the contribution of quasars to the ebl .",
    "the predicted attenuation of gamma rays from nearby radio sources such as mrk501 or mrk421 leads to a quasi - exponential cutoff near 10 tev due to interactions with the infrared part of the ebl , and to a cutoff near 100 gev due to interactions with the optical / uv part of the ebl for sources with redshifts in excess of one ."
