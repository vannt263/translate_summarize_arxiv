    "furthermore , the total energy @xmath7 is explicitly given by @xmath8 where the internal energy @xmath9 can be written as a function of @xmath10 defined through the thermodynamical relations .",
    "the temperature @xmath11 and entropy @xmath12 are the other two thermodynamic variables .    in the case of an ideal gas , the pressure _",

    "when the entropy @xmath12 = constant , the flow is called _ isentropic_. in this case , the pressure @xmath5 can be written as a function of the density @xmath6 , @xmath19 , and the flow is governed by the isentropic euler equations : @xmath20 then , by scaling , the pressure - density relation is @xmath21 the adiabatic exponent @xmath22 corresponds to the isentropic polytropic gas .",

    "sonic_.    we are interested in whether compressible vortex sheets / entropy waves in supersonic flow over the lipschitz wall are always stable under the @xmath0 perturbation of the incoming flow .",
    "multidimensional steady supersonic euler flows are important in many physical applications ( cf .",
    "courant - friedrichs courant - friedrichs-1948 ) . in particular ,",
    "when the upstream flow is a uniform steady flow above the plane wall in @xmath32 all the time , the flow downstream above a lipschitz wall in @xmath33 is governed by a steady euler flow after a sufficiently long time . moreover ,",
    "compressible vortex sheets and entropy waves occur ubiquitously in nature and are fundamental waves . furthermore , since steady euler flows are asymptotic states and may be global attractors of the corresponding unsteady euler flows , it is important to establish the existence of steady euler flows and understand their qualitative behavior to shed light on the long - time asymptotic behavior of the unsteady compressible euler flows , one of the most fundamental problems in mathematical fluid dynamics which is still wide open .",
    "we observe that the stability of contact discontinuities for the cauchy problem for strictly hyperbolic systems in one space dimension under a @xmath0 perturbation has been studied by sabl@xmath34-tougeron sable-1993 and corli  sabl@xmath34-tougeron corli - sable-1997 .",
    "in particular , the reflection coefficients , such as @xmath35 here , are required to be less than one , which is the stability condition for the mixed problem in the strip @xmath36 in the earlier works ; see , e.g. , sabl@xmath34-tougeron sable-1993 . working with the non - isentropic euler system and a uniform upstream flow , chen - zhang - zhu chen - zhang - zhu-2007 first proved the global existence in @xmath0 of supersonic euler flows containing a strong vortex sheet / entropy wave under the @xmath0 perturbation of the lipschitz wall by using the glimm scheme . the essential difference between system as analyzed in chen - zhang - zhu-2007 ( and in sections 27 here ) and strictly hyperbolic systems as considered in corli - sable-1997",
    ", sable-1993 is that two of the four characteristic eigenvalues coincide and have two linearly independent eigenvectors which determine precisely the compressible vortex sheets and entropy waves so that two independent parameters are required to describe them , respectively .    in this paper , for completeness , we first show , via the wave - front tracking method , the existence of solutions to the problem when a small @xmath0 perturbation is added to the uniform incoming flow . then the @xmath2stability of entropy solutions containing strong vortex sheets / entropy waves is established . as corollaries of these results , the estimates on the uniformly lipschitz semigroup @xmath37 of entropy solutions generated by the wave - front tracking approximations are obtained , and the uniqueness of weak solutions containing strong vortex sheets / entropy waves is established in a larger set of solutions , namely the class of viscosity solutions .    in the following ,",
    "we focus mainly on the problem in the region @xmath38 over the lipschitz wall for the supersonic euler flows @xmath39 governed by system , given that the corresponding problem for the isentropic system is simpler to analyze .",
    "the subsequent figure provides the schematic diagram for the problem we study :    the boundary and initial data in the problem are as follows :    * there is a lipschitz function @xmath40 such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 = @xmath46 as the outer normal vectors to @xmath47 at the respective points @xmath48 ( cf .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) . * the incoming flow @xmath49 at @xmath50",
    "is composed of two parts : 1 .   the upstream flow @xmath51 consists of one straight vortex sheet / entropy wave @xmath52 and two constant vectors @xmath53 , when @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , when @xmath56 , satisfying @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the sonic speed of state @xmath59 .",
    "2 .   the @xmath0 perturbation @xmath60 at @xmath61 so that @xmath62 .",
    "then we consider the following initial - boundary value problem for system : @xmath63    * definition 1.1 * ( _ admissible entropy solutions _ ) . a @xmath0 function @xmath64 is said to be an entropy solution of the initial - boundary value problem and  if and only if the following conditions hold :    * @xmath65 is a weak solution of ( 2.1 ) and satisfies @xmath66 * @xmath65 satisfies the _ steady entropy clausius inequality _ : @xmath67 in the distributional sense in @xmath38 including the lipschitz wall boundary .",
    "one of the essential developments within this paper is to develop suitable methods to deal with the challenges caused by the nonstrictly hyperbolicity of the system and the lipschitz wall boundary , in comparison with the previous progress with the strictly hyperbolic systems of conservation laws , particularly to the analysis of the cauchy problem . for supersonic euler flow with a strong shock - front emanating from the wedge vertex",
    ", chen - li chen - li-2008 worked out the issue for a lipschitz wedge boundary .",
    "we now discuss some main differences in our work here from the cauchy problem and the resulting key difficulties .",
    "we remark that , in the case of the cauchy problem concerning only @xmath68 waves , the decrease of the lyapunov functional and the @xmath2stability of the solutions were obtained through the cancellation of distances on both sides of waves . in the presence of a strong shock , for the @xmath2stability of solutions of the cauchy problem for strictly hyperbolic systems of conservation laws , the lyapunov functional",
    "was found to decrease by employing the strength of the strong shock to control the strengths of weak waves of the other families ( e.g. , see lewicka - trivisa lewicka - trivisa-2002 ) .",
    "in contrast with our lipschitz wall problem , which is a problem of initial - boundary value type , there is no such cancellation by the boundary as only one - side is possible near it .",
    "furthermore , no strong vortex sheets / entropy waves ( characteristic discontinuities ) nor strong shocks are present to handle the strength of the weak waves of the other families , and the terms in the estimates for the first and fourth family carry different signs . as such , it is difficult to say whether the functional can be made to decrease for our case of strong vortex sheets and entropy waves with multiplicity of eigenvalues .",
    "one of the key steps to resolve this is to use the physical feature of the boundary condition that the flow of two solutions near the boundary must run in parallel ( also see chen - li-2008 ) .",
    "this observation helps us to obtain additional quantitative relations near the boundary .",
    "then , applying suitable weights and adjustments in the coefficients of the lyapunov functional and using the cancellation between the different families , the functional is found to decrease in the flow direction .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall some fundamental properties of the two - dimensional steady euler system and discuss related nonlinear waves and wave interaction estimates . in section 3 ,",
    "the wave - front tracking algorithm is discussed , working in the presence of strong vortex sheets / entropy waves , the suitable interaction potential @xmath69 is constructed , including the effect of the lipschitz wall , and the existence of entropy solutions in @xmath0 is established for the initial - boundary value problem . in section 4 , we construct the lyapunov functional @xmath70 ( equivalent to the @xmath2distance between two entropy solutions @xmath65 and @xmath71 ) to include the nonlinear waves produced by the wall boundary vertices .",
    "then , in section 5 , the monotone decrease of the functional @xmath70 is established in the flow direction , leading to the @xmath2stability of the solutions containing strong vortex sheets / entropy waves . using the estimates established in sections 35 , in section 6",
    ", we obtain the existence of a lipschitz semigroup of solutions generated by a wave - front tracking approximation , as well as some estimates on the uniformly lipschitz semigroup @xmath37 produced by the limit of wave - front tracking approximations .",
    "moreover , the uniqueness of solutions with strong vortex sheets / entropy waves is obtained in the larger class of viscosity solutions .",
    "in this section , we first present some basic properties of the steady euler system . then related nonlinear waves and interaction estimates are discussed , which will be employed in the later sections .    consider the following vector functions of the solution @xmath65 : @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "then the steady euler equations in can be expressed in the following conservative form : @xmath75    when @xmath76 is a smooth solution , system is equivalent to @xmath77 then the roots of the fourth degree polynomial @xmath78 are the eigenvalues of ; that is , the solutions of the equation @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the sonic speed . for supersonic flows ( i.e. @xmath28 ) , system is hyperbolic . specifically , when @xmath81 , system has four real eigenvalues in the @xmath82-direction : @xmath83 with the four corresponding linearly independent eigenvectors given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 the re - normalization factors such that @xmath86 , given that the @xmath87th - characteristic fields , @xmath88 , are genuinely nonlinear .",

    "@xmath96    albeit the two contact discontinuities , the vortex sheet and the entropy wave , above match as a single discontinuity in the physical @xmath97plane , two independent parameters are needed to describe them in the phase space @xmath98 since there are two linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the repeated eigenvalues @xmath99 of the linearly degenerate characteristics fields .",

    "furthermore , for each @xmath112 or @xmath113 , the curves @xmath114 and @xmath115 at the state @xmath107 have the same curvature .",
