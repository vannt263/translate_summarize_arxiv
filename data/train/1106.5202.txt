    "the observed masses and mixings of the quarks and leptons will provide a promising clue to a unified understanding of those fundamental particles .",
    "for such the purpose , not only investigating a theoretical model , but also searching for phenomenological mass matrix seem to be still effective . as one of phenomenological mass matrix models of the quarks and leptons , the so - called  yukawaon \" model @xcite ( a kind of  flavon \" models @xcite ) has been proposed . here ,",
    "the  effective \" yukawa coupling constants @xmath15 are given by @xmath16 @xmath17 is an energy scale of the effective theory , and @xmath18 are vacuum expectation value ( vev ) matrices of scalar fields @xmath19 with @xmath20 components .",
    "( hereafter we call fields @xmath19  yukawaons \" . )",
    "the most characteristic point in the yukawaon model is that all vevs @xmath18 are described in terms of only one fundamental vev matrix @xmath21 .",
    "for example , in a yukawaon model with an o(3 ) family symmetry @xcite , the charged lepton , neutrino , up - quark , and down - quark mass matrices @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath22 are given by    @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 in the diagonal basis of @xmath1 , while @xmath31 is given by a form @xmath32 in the diagonal basis of @xmath2 .    in this paper , we will find out a special form of the neutrino mass matrix which is compatible with the observed neutrino data in spite of having no adjustable parameters .",
    "the form will be obtained along the lines of the yukawaon model by changing the structure of @xmath33 from eq.(1.2 ) .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is still given by the form of seesaw type , @xmath34 with @xmath35 , but the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath36 is changed into a simple form @xmath37 here , we assume that the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath1 is given by @xmath38 differently from eq.(1.2 ) , and we also redefine @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42    note that there are no @xmath43 term , no @xmath44 term and no @xmath31 in eq.(1.11 ) , i.e. @xmath0 is simply given by @xmath45 in other words , there is no adjustable parameter in the present neutrino mass matrix , except for @xmath3 in @xmath1 and @xmath4 in @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath39 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is not to derive the mass matrix forms ( 1.11 ) - ( 1.13 ) theoretically , but to demonstrate that the phenomenological neutrino mass matrix ( 1.15 ) with eqs.(1.11 ) - ( 1.13 ) can be compatible with the present neutrino data in spite of quite few parameters .",
    "we predict @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ev , and so on , by using observed values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath12 as input values . in this paper , for simplicity , we do not discuss the down - quark mass matrix @xmath22 and the cabibbo - maskawa- kobayashi @xcite ( ckm ) mixing .    in the next section , superpotentials for yukawaons and the assignments of the fields in the present u(3 )",
    "yukawaon model are investigated . in sec .  3 ,",

    "in this section , we give superpotentials for the yukawaons and the assignments of the fields in the present u(3 ) yukawaon model .    in the yukawaon model ,",
    "the order of the fields is important .",
    "therefore , in this paper , let us assume a u(3 ) family symmetry instead of o(3 ) and denote fields @xmath50 and @xmath51 of u(3 ) as @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "( therefore , it should be noted that a term @xmath54 is allowed , but @xmath55 and @xmath56 are forbidden . ) in the u(3 ) model , for example , the relation ( 1.6 ) is re - expressed as @xmath57 with @xmath58 . in order to distinguish each yukawaon from other yukawaons , although we assumed u(1)@xmath59 charge in the o(3 ) model @xcite , in this u(3 ) model , we assume only @xmath47 charge conservation instead of u(1)@xmath59 charge conservation . for the right handed neutrino sector ( @xmath60 ) , it should be noted that we can not add @xmath61 term to @xmath60 as in eq.(1.4 ) . in the old model , we assigned the u(1)@xmath59 charges @xmath62 only for gauge singlet fields , e.g. @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 . besides , we assumed @xmath65 in order to build a model without @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , we could obtain @xmath67 in the old model .",
    "however , in this u(3 ) model , we can not obtain @xmath68 .",
    "besides , we can not introduce a @xmath43 term such as in eq.(1.5 ) .",
    "we assume the following superpotential @xmath69 : @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 + \\frac{\\lambda_e}{\\lambda } { \\rm tr } [ \\bar{\\phi}_0 ( e'+   a_e x_2 ) \\bar{\\phi}_0 \\theta^e ] , \\eqno(2.3)\\ ] ] @xmath73 + \\frac{\\lambda_d}{\\lambda } { \\rm tr } [   \\bar{\\phi}_0 ( e + a_d e^{i\\alpha_d } x_3 ) \\bar{\\phi}_0 { \\theta}^d ] , \\eqno(2.4)\\ ] ] @xmath74 + \\frac{\\lambda^{\\prime}_u}{\\lambda } { \\rm tr } [ \\bar{\\phi}_0 ( e + a_u e^{i\\alpha_u } x_3 ) \\bar{\\phi}_0   \\theta^{u \\prime } ]   , \\eqno(2.5)\\ ] ] @xmath75 + \\frac{\\lambda_{u}}{\\lambda } { \\rm tr}[\\bar{\\phi}_u { e}^u \\bar{\\phi}_{u } { \\theta}_u ]   +    \\frac{\\lambda_{0u}}{\\lambda^{5 } } { \\rm tr } [    ( \\bar{e}_u e^u)^{3 } \\bar{e}_u \\theta^u ]   , \\eqno(2.6)\\ ] ] @xmath76 + \\frac{\\lambda_r}{\\lambda}{\\rm tr } [ \\left ( \\bar{\\phi}_u    e^u \\bar{y}_e   + \\bar{y}_e { e}^u \\bar{\\phi}_u \\right ) { \\theta}^r ] , \\eqno(2.7)\\ ] ] where , in eq.(2.2 ) , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are su(2)@xmath79 doublet fields , and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) are su(2)@xmath79 singlet fields .",
    "the other fields in eqs.(2.3)-(2.7 ) have quantum numbers defined in table 1 .    .",
    "assignments of @xmath47 charges , where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the values in the third raw denote @xmath47 charge values in a special case under the assumptions ( a.11 ) and ( a.14 ) . for more details , see eqs.(a.1 ) - ( a.20 ) in appendix a. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have found out a special form of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 based on a yukawaon model with u(3 ) family symmetry , which has quite few free parameters . with this form of @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath0 can give reasonable predictions in spite of having no adjustable parameters , i.e. the @xmath0 is simply given by the form ( 1.15 ) , and the mass matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 include parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , which are fixed by their observed mass ratios . in this yukawaon model , the yukawaon vev matrices are described in terms of a new fundamental vev matrix @xmath85 .",
    "for example , the yukawaon vev matrix @xmath86 for the charged leptons is given by ( 2.10 ) which has the structure of @xmath87 with a new parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this structure in @xmath86 has been chosen from a phenomenological point of view and there is no reason why @xmath86 takes such a form .",
    "nevertheless if we accept the form ( 2.10 ) , then we can obtain a simple form of vev matrix @xmath88 for right - handed neutrinos without introducing the somewhat strange vev matrix @xmath89 and @xmath43 term that were introduced in the o(3 ) model to get the observed nearly tribimaximal neutrino mixing @xcite .",
    "the new model has only four parameters @xmath90 as far as the up - quark and lepton sectors are concerned .",
    "on the other hand , we have 12 observable quantities ( 2 up - quark mass ratios , 4 lepton mass ratios , and 4 + 2 lepton mixing parameters ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 affects only the prediction of @xmath92 , so that we have fixed it by the observed value of @xmath93 .",
    "the parameter @xmath94 is sensitive only to @xmath11 , so that we have fixed by the observed value of @xmath95 as seen in fig .  2 ( b ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is determined from the cross point of the predicted values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane .",
    "note that we have used only the observed values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 in order to fix the three parameters @xmath98 .",
    "although we have tacitly used @xmath99 , we have not used the observed value of @xmath100 explicitly .    on the other hand , for the remaining 2 down - quark mass ratios and 4 ckm mixing parameters , we have additional 2 parameters ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) .",
    "regrettably , we can not obtain reasonable predictions with the two parameters , although we can fit the values of down - quark mass ratios and @xmath103 .",
    "the situation is the same as in the previous o(3 ) model .",
    "we must introduce a phase matrix @xmath104 with two parameters @xmath105 and a common mass shift term @xmath106 .",
    "then , five parameters can fit six observables barely .",
    "therefore , the model is not so attractive for down - quark sector . in this paper",
    ", we did not demonstrate the explicit numerical fitting for down - quark mass rations and ckm mixing parameters .",
    "\\(i ) the model predicts @xmath107 . in the previous o(3 ) model ,",
    "the predicted value of @xmath108 was invisibly small , i.e. @xmath109 . the t2k experiment @xcite put a constraint @xmath110 ( @xmath111 c.l . ) for @xmath112 and a normal hierarchy .",
    "our predicted value @xmath113 seems to be somewhat lower than the experimental lower bound .",
    "however , as seen in table 3 , our prediction on @xmath114 gives @xmath115 , which decreases the lower bound @xmath116 of the t2k result to @xmath117 .",
    "besides , the double chooz experiment @xcite has reported that @xmath118 at @xmath119 cl .",
    "the lower value is @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , we consider that the predicted value @xmath113 is yet not ruled out , although the status is considerably severe .",
    "\\(ii ) it also predicts a reasonable value of @xmath121 in contrast to the case of the o(3 ) model in which we could not predict @xmath122 .",
    "( in the previous model , the value of @xmath122 needed to adjust the additional free parameter @xmath44 in eq.(1.4 ) . )",
    "\\(iii ) the present model gives approximately degenerate neutrino masses @xmath123 .",
    "the predicted value for the effective majorana mass @xmath8 ev in the neutrinoless double beta decay will be within our reach of the future experiments .    the big ansatz is the existence of the @xmath124 term in the charged lepton sector ( 1.12 ) . at present",
    ", there is no idea on this term .",
    "besides , it seems that the present lepton mass structure is ill matched with the charged lepton mass relation @xcite @xmath125 the purpose in the early stage of the yukawaon model was to predict the charged lepton mass relation ( 4.1 ) . the bilinear form ( 1.2 ) for",
    "the charged lepton mass matrix was indispensable to predict @xcite the relation ( 4.1 ) .",
    "if we adopt the present scenario , we must reconsider the origin of the charged lepton mass spectrum .",
    "however , in this paper , we do not use the relation ( 4.1 ) , but only use the observed charged lepton mass values as input values . therefore the bilinear form such as ( 1.2 ) is not necessarily required in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , the formula ( 4.1 ) is still attractive . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also attractive that we can predict 12 observables ( 2 + 2 + 2 lepton and up - quark mass ratios , and 4 + 2 pmns mixing parameters ) under 4 adjustable parameters @xmath90 if once we accept this ansatz ( 1.12 ) .",
    "it is a future task how to understand the existence of @xmath124 term .    in conclusion , although the form @xmath0 is , at present , not one which is derived from a rigid theoretical ground , the form will offer a suggestive hint for a unification model of quark and lepton mass matrices .        in the present model , as well as in the o(3 ) model , we construct a model without introducing a yukawaon @xmath66 by replacing @xmath66 by @xmath126 .",
    "the simple way to guarantee that the yukawaon @xmath126 couples not only to the charged lepton sector but also to the dirac neutrino sector is to introduce the following @xmath47 charge assignment , @xmath127",
    "@xmath128 the @xmath47 charge of @xmath129 is free parameter in the form ( 2.8 ) .",
    "for simplicity , we take @xmath130 hereafter , we will denote @xmath131 and @xmath132 as @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "each yukawaon is distinguished from other yukawaons by the @xmath47 charges .",
    "if we define a parameter @xmath135 as @xmath136 ,   \\eqno(a.4)\\ ] ] then , we can express the @xmath47 charges of the other fields from eq.(2.2 ) as follows : @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 from eqs.(2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) , we obtain @xmath144 @xmath145 respectively . from eqs.(a.12 ) and ( a.13 ) , we obtain a relation @xmath146 the relation ( a.14 ) leads to @xmath147 only when the value @xmath135 is a positive integer , eq.(a.15 ) means that an additional term @xmath148 ,   \\eqno(a.16)\\ ] ] can appear in the expression ( 2.6 ) .",
    "note that if @xmath135 is not a positive integer , the factor @xmath149 does not have a physical meaning , because a term with @xmath150 can not appear in the superpotential terms .",
    "therefore , the @xmath135 defined in eq.(a.4 ) is allowed only for @xmath151 .    as we see in eqs.(a.5 ) - ( a.11 ) , these @xmath47 charges are described by four parameters @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath133 and @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , in order to fix these @xmath47 charge values , we have to assume four constraints for these @xmath47 charges . on the other hand ,",
    "the fields @xmath154 , @xmath60 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 are gauge singlets , so that they must be distinguished only by @xmath47 charges .",
    "we can choose a suitable parameter set @xmath159 . here",
    ", let us demonstrate an example of @xmath47 charge assignments , although it is not the purpose of the present paper to give such an explicit @xmath47 charge assignment .    for example , we put the following working hypothesis : @xmath160 @xmath161 the constraint ( a.17 ) is an analogy that the yukawa coupling constants in the standard model do not have @xmath47 charges . the constraints ( a.17 ) and (",
    "a.18 ) leads to the relation @xmath162 .",
    "of course , since the yukawaon @xmath163 has been replaced by @xmath154 in the present model , the first constraint in eq.(a.17 ) reads as @xmath164 , and since @xmath165 in the model , the second constraint in eq.(a.6 ) reads as @xmath166 .",
    "since @xmath167 is given by eq.(a.7 ) , the requirement @xmath164 together with @xmath166 requires @xmath168 .",
    "thus , the constraints ( a.17 ) and ( a.18 ) fix the parameters @xmath159 as @xmath169 the explicit values of these @xmath47 values are listed in table 1 . since the @xmath47 charges of @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 are still free parameters , we take @xmath173 for simplicity . as we see in table 1 , the fields @xmath154 , @xmath60 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath158 can safely have different @xmath47 charges from each other .    thus , the assumption can lead to plausible @xmath47 charge values ( a.19 ) , so that we consider that the assumption is reasonable .",
    "now we have an additional term , @xmath174 ,    \\eqno(a.20)\\ ] ] which should be included in @xmath2 given in eq.(2.6 ) .",
    "we define @xmath177 which are invariant under permutation symmetries s@xmath178 and @xmath176 , respectively .",
    "a rotation matrix @xmath47 which transforms the matrix @xmath175 into @xmath176 has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the rotation matrix @xmath47 is given by @xmath179 where @xmath47 is defined as follows : @xmath180 @xmath181 @xmath182 @xmath183 the matrix @xmath53 is known as a matrix which diagonalizes the matrix @xmath175 into @xmath184 and also @xmath185      in the expression ( b.9 ) of @xmath47 , when we define @xmath189 the rotation matrix @xmath47 is expressed as follows : @xmath190 here , @xmath191",
    "( @xmath192 ) satisfies @xmath193 and we can choose @xmath191 such as @xmath194 suggested from the charged lepton mass relation ( 4.1 ) , if we choose @xmath191 as @xmath195 where @xmath196 , then , the matrix @xmath47 satisfies @xmath197 since @xmath198 where @xmath199 the following relation holds : @xmath200 where @xmath201 is defined by eq.(b.8 ) .",
    "however , note that , from eqs.(b.8 ) and ( b.18 ) , we can not conclude @xmath202 .",
    "thus , it seems the rotation matrix @xmath47 from @xmath175 into @xmath176 is deeply related to the charged lepton mass relation ( 4.1 ) , but it is not clear why the form @xmath176 appears in the charge lepton sector .",
    "this is still an open question at present .",
