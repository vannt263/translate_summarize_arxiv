    "in addition to the known particles and interactions of the standard model ( sm ) , there are many compelling reasons to consider a ` hidden world ' of particles .",
    "we define a hidden sector generically as any set of particles , in addition to those of the sm , that are not charged under any of the sm gauge groups .",
    "the possibilities for such models are endless , and if they have no testable consequences then such speculation has little scientific merit .",
    "however , there do exist a limited number of interactions that could exist between a hidden sector and the sm that are renormalisable and relevant or marginal , i.e.  corresponding to terms in the lagrangian with dimension @xmath2 4 and which therefore are not suppressed below some energy scale .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to identify and explore such possibilities as potential windows into a hidden sector .",
    "one possibility is kinetic mixing of abelian gauge fields of the hidden sector and the sm  @xcite , where the resulting phenomenology overlaps with standard @xmath3 physics  @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is a renormalisable interaction between scalar fields in the two sectors .",
    "this mixing would be between the sm higgs boson , which may have already been discovered  @xcite , and an exotic singlet scalar state that obtains a vacuum expectation value .",
    "this possibility therefore corresponds to an extended higgs sector , with a new scalar that may be responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking in the hidden sector . for concreteness , we study a minimal ` toy model ' of this type  the hidden abelian higgs model  @xcite  which involves the addition of a new scalar singlet charged under a @xmath4 gauge symmetry .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of this model for lhc physics have been well studied , but there are significant regions of the parameter space in which the new higgs particle would be very difficult to detect at the lhc if its mass is @xmath0 1  tev @xcite . the purpose of the present work , therefore , is to investigate the possibility of detecting such a particle at the compact linear collider ( clic ) , a future electron - positron collider experiment currently under discussion  @xcite .",
    "this experiment would have some advantages for detecting such a particle when compared to the lhc , so this possibility is well worth exploring .",
    "we present our key findings on the basis of a parton level analysis for the recoil mass spectrum from @xmath5 production in sections [ subsec : elecrecoil ] , the @xmath6 signal in section [ subsec : zz ] , and finally the @xmath7 signature in [ subsec : hh ] .",
    "we begin with a review of the hidden abelian higgs model . in this model",
    "the hidden sector contains a complex scalar singlet @xmath8 which is charged under a @xmath9 gauge symmetry .",
    "the higgs lagrangian is @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 all positive ( while @xmath15 can take either sign ) . in this case , the @xmath9 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by @xmath8 taking a particular vacuum expectation value ( vev ) ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the resultant massless goldstone mode gets absorbed by the vector boson corresponding to the abelian gauge symmetry , as in the sm . in the unitary gauge which eliminates the unphysical goldstone modes ,",
    "the scalar fields can be written @xmath17 where v(@xmath18  gev ) and @xmath19 are the vevs of @xmath20 and @xmath8 , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the massive modes of these fields .",
    "however , the mixing term @xmath23 means that the physical mass eigenstates @xmath24 , @xmath25 of the theory are a linear combination of the two @xmath26 where we choose @xmath27 , with @xmath28    the higgs masses and mixing are subject to a number of constraints .",
    "precision electroweak constraints and direct searches play central roles in constraining what the parameter space can be .",
    "the model has four free parameters .",
    "starting with two key observables  @xmath29 and @xmath30 ",
    "one is left with two parameters that can be chosen freely .",
    "an analysis of the parameter space of the theory @xcite has shown that large regions are compatible with the theoretical constraints , including the regions which are explored in this paper .    for @xmath31 ,",
    "which we assume throughout this study , the decay @xmath32 is possible . the partial width for this decay is given by the tree level formula @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the coupling associated with the @xmath35 term in the lagrangian , the expression for which can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 can also decay into the sm particles , predominantly @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 , with a width @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the standard tree level result for a sm higgs of mass @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath25 could , in principle , also decay to hidden sector particles with a hidden width @xmath41 .",
    "this possibility has been discussed in @xcite , and in section [ subsec : elecrecoil ] we briefly touch on a clic search channel which could be useful if the hidden width is significant .",
    "however , in this paper we assume that hidden decays of @xmath25 are kinematically forbidden ( i.e.  the mass of the hidden sector products exceeds @xmath29 ) and so only the sm and @xmath32 decay channels contribute to the total width .",
    "the @xmath42 suppression of widths is central to this study .",
    "a sm higgs resonance becomes so wide once its mass is in the trans - tev region that it becomes impossible to find and it can no longer be understood as a particle .",
    "this suppression allows us to keep the @xmath25 resonance reasonably narrow despite its large mass , and therefore to exploit standard search channels which have already been considered for the heavy ( but sub - tev ) sm higgs case .",
    "clic is a proposed linear @xmath43 collider presently under discussion @xcite .",
    "it is proposed to have a nominal center of mass energy up to 3  tev , and a design luminosity of @xmath44  @xmath45s@xmath46 which should result in more than @xmath47  fb@xmath46 of integrated luminosity per year at peak design .",
    "lepton collision events have the advantage of being ` cleaner ' than at a hadron collider , however , the added complication of strong beamstrahlung at a tev - scale lepton collider presents its own set of issues .",
    "beamstahlung is the emission of hard photons from the colliding bunches , a consequence of the bending of particle trajectories in the strong electromagnetic fields which results from the small bunch sizes required in a high luminosity linear collider @xcite .",
    "the effects which are most relevant to our study are the resulting @xmath48 hadron background , and the spread in the center of mass energies of @xmath43 collisions",
    ".    collisions between beamstrahlung photons result in hadron production focussed mainly in the forward region of the detector , ( @xmath49 100  mrad ) , but also with energy deposition per event @xmath50 50  gev in the region @xmath51 280  mrad relevant to the hadronic calorimeters @xcite .",
    "this has the potential to impact jet reconstruction and missing energy measurements , and proper evaluation of this background requires a detector simulation .",
    "we have made no attempt to account for this backround in our study , however , we expect its impact to be modest ( e.g. , see p.553 of @xcite ) .",
    "more significant is the effect of beamstrahlung on the luminosity spectrum ; electrons loose energy due to photon emission , and the effects on a colliding pair are correlated which makes a parametrisation of the spectrum difficult .",
    "we account for this by making use of a luminosity file generated from the program guineapig @xcite , which simulates the beam - beam interaction and produces a list of pairs of particle energies which can be used in a monte carlo simulation on an event - by - event basis .",
    "heavy higgs production at clic proceeds predominantly via vector boson fusion , either by @xmath37 fusion with final state @xmath43 , or @xmath36 fusion with final state @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 ` higgstrahlung ' process , which dominates at a low energy lepton collider like the international linear collider ( ilc ) , gets weaker with increasing center of mass energy such that at clic for a 1 tev sm higgs the higgstrahlung production cross section is @xmath54 1  fb compared with 8.4  fb for @xmath37 fusion and 79  fb for @xmath36 fusion @xcite .",
    "although @xmath55 higgs boson is somewhat meaningless concept in the sm , due to the strong , non - perturbative growth of its couplings at that high mass , the computation of the cross - section at leading order is still useful for our purposes .",
    "this is because the state we are interested in  the lightly mixed - in singlet higgs boson has couplings that are small in comparison and perturbative due to the small mixing angle .    in the following sections we investigate three search strategies , focussing on that described in section [ subsec : zz ] .",
    "all signal processes are simulated at tree level using the monte carlo event generator pythia 6.4.24 @xcite , while background processes are simulated using comphep 4.4 @xcite .",
    "the luminosity spread due to beamstrahlung is included in the pythia simulations using calypso @xcite .",
    "the beamstrahlung tool available in comphep is suitable for a low energy lepton collider , but the yokoya - chen approxiation which is used breaks down at high energies and so is unsuitable for our study @xcite .",
    "the backgrounds plotted in section [ subsec : zz ] do not include the effects of the luminosity spread . as we will discuss later",
    ", we consider this as a small systematic error in our subsequent analysis .",
    "all signals are simulated in pythia using calypso and so include the effects of beamstrahlung ( except where explicitly stated otherwise ) .",
    "one inclusive search strategy is to look for recoiling high energy electrons from the @xmath37 fusion process , which are peaked in the forward ( small polar angle ) region .",
    "this has the advantage of summing over all possible higgs decays , even invisible ones , and so provides a rather model - independent search channel @xcite .",
    "it suffers from relying on the smaller @xmath37 fusion cross section , and from the fact that instrumentation for electron tracking and tagging can only cover angles @xmath0 100 mrad and therefore can pick up only the tail of the electron distribution which peaks at @xmath56 50  mrad ( see left panel of figure [ fig : recoil ] ) .",
    "events that result in both the outgoing electron and the positron taking an angle @xmath51 120  mrad represent only 12% of the total production cross section .",
    "the electron recoil mass is the invariant mass of the decay products against which the @xmath43 pair recoil assuming the collision occurs at the nominal center of mass energy , defined as @xmath57 a higgs resonance would potentially show up as a resonant peak in this electron recoil mass spectrum , centered at @xmath29 .",
    "we plot an electron recoil mass spectrum for @xmath58 = 1  tev , @xmath59 = 0.3 in figure [ fig : recoil ] , both excluding ( solid black line ) , and including ( dashed blue line ) the effects of beamstrahlung on the luminosity spectrum .",

    "total cross sections for a range of points in the parameter space are presented in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the width is calculated under the assumption that @xmath25 decays only into sm particles , though as explained earlier this channel could be used to search for an invisibly decaying higgs .",
    "it can be seen from table  [ tab:1 ] that this channel is promising for a substantial region of the parameter space ( @xmath62 at @xmath63 1  tev , @xmath64 at @xmath65 2 tev ) , so long as backgrounds are small , as is expected .",
    "it should be noted that for a 600  gev sm higgs boson , a consistency - check calculation using this method gives a cross section which is a factor of 4 smaller than given in previous work @xcite , apparently using the same cuts , and the reason for this discrepancy is unknown .",

    "jets produced from @xmath78 quarks can leave a highly distinctive signature , and can be identified as such with some probability  the @xmath78-tagging efficiency .",

    "the number of @xmath80 events , @xmath91 , as a function of the number of @xmath92 events , @xmath93 , is then roughly @xmath94 having taken the values @xmath95 ( consistent with @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "so for instance , with @xmath87 and @xmath100 , we get @xmath101 , while @xmath89 would give @xmath102 .",
    "clearly there are large regions of the parameter space that was explored in section [ subsec : zz ] that could also give a clear @xmath80 signal , though this is much more sensitive to the choice of parameters .",
    "although current searches for new physics at the tev - scale are focussed on the experiments at the lhc , it should be remembered that there are possible states that could influence the electroweak symmetry breaking sector yet remain undiscovered there , but which could be discovered by new experiments that we currently have the capability of building .",
    "one such possibility is the case where a hidden sector scalar mixes lightly with the sm higgs , resulting in two physical massive higgs particles .",
    "the light mixing implies a heavily suppressed coupling to the sm for one of these particles , which makes its discovery very challenging .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the prospects for finding a trans - tev higgs particle at a 3  tev electron - positron collider and have found that clic could substantially extend the reach for such searches compared to the lhc .",
    "we have discussed three possible search channels : an electron recoil analysis , which would be particularly useful for an invisibly decaying higgs , the sm - like decay @xmath103 mode which is powerful and generic , and @xmath79 decays which could give a very clear and distinctive signal , shedding more light on the model parameters . data from a variety of channels could be combined to boost the confidence level for any discovery .",
    "it must therefore be stressed that standard heavy higgs search channels that are normally considered for masses @xmath104  tev could be of importance well into tev energies , due to the possibility of strong width suppression . although the case for a multi - tev electron - positron collider depends on whether new physics is discovered at the lhc and on what form it takes , we believe that the potential for discovering new scalars that couple to a hidden sector , and which might not be found at the lhc , enhances that case .",
