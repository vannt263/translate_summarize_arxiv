    "computer science and computer engineering are disciplines that have transformed every aspect of modern society . in these fields , cutting - edge research is about new models of computation , new materials and techniques for building computer hardware , novel methods for speeding - up algorithms , and building bridges between computer science and several other scientific fields that allow scientists to both think of natural phenomena as computational procedures as well as to employ novel models of computation to simulate natural processes ( e.g. @xcite . ) in particular , quantifying the resources required to process information and/or to compute a solution , i.e. to assess the complexity of a computational process , is a prioritized research area as it allows us to estimate implementation costs as well as to compare problems by comparing the complexity of their solutions . among the mathematical tools employed in advanced algorithm development ,",
    "classical random walks , a subset of stochastic processes ( that is , processes whose evolution involves chance ) , have proved to be a very powerful technique for the development of stochastic algorithms @xcite .",
    "in addition to the key role they play in algorithmics , classical random walks are ubiquitous in many areas of knowledge as physics , biology , finance theory , computer vision , and earthquake modelling @xcite , to name a few .    theoretical computer science , in its canonical form , does not take into account the physical properties of those devices used for performing computational or information processing tasks . as this characteristic",
    "could be perceived as a drawback because the behavior of any _ physical _ device used for computation or information processing must ultimately be predicted by the laws of physics , several research approaches have therefore concentrated on thinking of computation in a physical context ( e.g @xcite . ) among those physical theories that could be used for this purpose , quantum mechanics stands in first place .",
    "quantum computation can be defined as the interdisciplinary scientific field devoted to build quantum computers and quantum information processing systems , i.e. computers and information processing systems that use the quantum mechanical properties of nature .",
    "research on quantum computation heavily focuses on building and running algorithms which exploit the physical properties of quantum computers . among the theoretical discoveries and promising conjectures that have positioned quantum computation as a key element in modern science , we find :    1 .",

    "building good quantum algorithms is a difficult task as quantum mechanics is a counterintuitive theory and intuition plays a major role in algorithm design and , for a quantum algorithm to be good , it is not enough to perform the task it is intended to : it must also do better , i.e. be more efficient , than any classical algorithm ( at least better than those classical algorithms known at the time of developing corresponding quantum algorithms . )",

    "quantum walks , the quantum mechanical counterpart of classical random walks , is an advanced tool for building quantum algorithms ( e.g. @xcite ) that has been recently shown to constitute a universal model of quantum computation @xcite .",

    "the main difference between these two sets is the timing used to apply corresponding evolution operators . in the case of discrete quantum walks , the corresponding evolution operator of the system",

    "our approach in the development of this work has been to study those concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum computation relevant to the computational aspects of quantum walks .",

    "* universality of quantum walks*. i review in this last section a very recent and most important contribution in the field of quantum walks : computational universality of both continuous- and discrete - time quantum walks .",
    "quantum walks are quantum counterparts of classical random walks .",
    "since classical random walks have been successfully adopted to develop classical algorithms and one of the main topics in quantum computation is the creation of quantum algorithms which are faster than their classical counterparts , there has been a huge interest in understanding the properties of quantum walks over the last few years .",
    "in addition to their usage in computer science , the study of quantum walks is relevant to building methods in order to test the quantumness  of emerging technologies for the creation of quantum computers as well as to model natural phenomena .",
    "quantum walks is a relatively new research topic .",
    "although some authors have selected the name quantum random walk  to refer to quantum phenomena @xcite and , in fact , in a seminal work by r.p .",
    "feynman about quantum mechanical computers @xcite we find a proposal that could be interpreted as a continuous quantum walk @xcite , it is generally accepted that the first paper with quantum walks as its main topic was published in 1993 by aharonov _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "thus , the links between classical random walks and quantum walks as well as the utility of quantum walks in computer science , are two fresh and open areas of research ( among scientific contributions on the links between classical and quantum walks , konno has proposed in @xcite solid mathematical connections between correlated random walks and quantum walks using the @xmath0 matrix method introduced in @xcite . )",
    "two models of quantum walks have been suggested : +   + - the first model , called * discrete quantum walks * , consists of two quantum mechanical systems , named a walker and a coin , as well as an evolution operator which is applied to both systems only in discrete time steps .",
    "the mathematical structure of this model is evolution via unitary operator , i.e. @xmath1 .",
    "+ - the second model , named * continuous quantum walks * , consists of a walker and an evolution ( hamiltonian ) operator of the system that can be applied with no timing restrictions at all , i.e. the walker walks any time .",
    "the mathematical structure of this model is evolution via the schrdinger equation .",
    "+ in both discrete and continuous models , the topology on which quantum walks have been performed and their properties computed are discrete graphs .",
    "this is mainly because graphs are widely used in computer science and building up quantum algorithms based on quantum walks has been a prioritized activity in this field .",
    "the original idea behind the construction of quantum algorithms was to start by initializing a set of qubits and then to apply ( one of more ) evolution operators several times _ without making intermediate measurements _ , as measurements were meant to be performed only at the end of the computational process ( for example , see the quantum algorithms reported in @xcite . ) not surprisingly , the first quantum algorithms based on quantum walks were designed using the same strategy : initialize qubits , apply evolution operators and measure only to calculate the final outcome of the algorithm .",
    "indeed , this method has proved itself very useful for building several remarkable algorithms ( e.g. @xcite . )",
    "however , as the field has matured , it has been reported that performing ( partial ) measurements on a quantum walk may lead to interesting mathematical properties for algorithm development , like the top hat probability distribution ( e.g. @xcite . )",
    "moreover and expanding on the idea of using more sophisticated tools from the repertoire of quantum mechanics , recent reports have shown the effect of using weak measurements on the walker probability distribution of discrete quantum walks @xcite .",
    "the rest of this section is organized as follows .",
    "i begin with a short introduction to those properties of classical discrete random walks on undirected graphs relevant to algorithm development , including definitions for hitting time , mixing time and mixing rate , as well as mathematical expressions for hitting time on an unrestricted line and on a circle .",

    "finally , readers who are not yet acquainted with the mathematical and/or physical foundations of quantum computation may find the following references useful : @xcite .",
    "classical discrete random walks were first thought as stochastic processes with no straightforward relation to algorithm development .",
    "thus , in addition to references like @xcite in which the mathematical foundations of random walks can be found , references @xcite are highly recommendable for a deeper understanding of algorithm development based on classical random walks .",
    "a classical discrete random walk on a line is a particular kind of stochastic process .",
    "the simplest classical random walk on a line consists of a particle ( the walker  ) jumping to either left or right depending on the outcomes of a probability system ( the coin  ) with ( at least ) two mutually exclusive results , i.e. the particle moves according to a probability distribution ( fig .",
    "( [ ucrw_line ] ) . )",
    "the generalization to discrete random walks on spaces of higher dimensions ( graphs ) is straightforward .",
    "an example of a discrete random walk on a graph is a particle moving on a lattice where each node has @xmath2 vertices , and the particle moves according to the outcomes produced by tossing a dice .",
    "classical random walks on graphs can be seen as markov chains ( @xcite . )    now , let @xmath3 be a stochastic process which consists of the path of a particle which moves along an axis with steps of one unit at time intervals also of one unit ( fig .",
    "( [ ucrw_line ] ) . ) at any step , the particle has a probability @xmath4 of going to the right and @xmath5 of going to the left .",
    "each step is modelled by a bernoulli - distributed random variable @xcite and the probability of finding the particle in position @xmath6 after @xmath7 steps and having as initial position @xmath8 is given by the binomial distribution @xmath9 @xmath10    @xmath11    fig .",

    "( [ variance_unrestricted_rw_line ] ) will be used in the following sections to show one of the earliest results on comparing classical random walks to quantum walks .",
    "graphs that encode the structure of a group are called * cayley graphs*. cayley graphs are a vehicle for translating mathematical structures of scientific and engineering problems into forms amenable to algorithm development for scientific computing .",
    "* cayley graph*. let @xmath19 be a finite group , and let @xmath20 be a generating set for g. the cayley graph of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath21 has a vertex for every element of @xmath19 , with an edge from @xmath22 to @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "graphs and markov chains can be put in an elegant framework which turns out to be very useful for the development of algorithmic applications :    let @xmath27 be a connected , undirected graph with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath19 induces a markov chain @xmath30 if the states of @xmath30 are the vertices of @xmath19 , and @xmath24 @xmath31 @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the degree of vertex @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath19 is connected , then @xmath30 is irreducible and aperiodic @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 has a unique stationary distribution .",
    "let @xmath19 be a connected , undirected graph with @xmath7 nodes and @xmath35 edges , and let @xmath30 be its corresponding markov chain .",
    "then , @xmath30 has a unique distribution @xmath36 for all components @xmath37 of @xmath38 .",
    "[ theorem_stationary_distribution_undirected_graph ]    note that theorem [ theorem_stationary_distribution_undirected_graph ] holds even when the distribution @xmath39 is not uniform .",

    "we have established the relationship between markov chains and graphs .",
    "we now proceed to define the concepts that make discrete random walks on graphs useful in computer science .",

    ". examples of discrete random walks on graphs are a classical random walk on a circle or on a 3-dimensional mesh .",
    "we now introduce several measures to quantify the performance of discrete random walks on graphs .",
    "these measures play an important role in the quantitative theory of random walks , as well as in the application of this kind of markov chains in computer science .    *",
    "hitting time*. the hitting time @xmath51 is the expected number of steps before node @xmath52 is visited , starting from node @xmath53 .",
    "[ hitting_time_classical ]    * mixing rate*. the mixing rate is a measure of how fast the discrete random walk converges to its limiting distribution .",
    "the mixing rate can be defined in many ways , depending on the type of graph we want to work with .",
    "we use the definition given in @xcite .",
    "+ if the graph is non - bipartite then @xmath54 as @xmath55 , and the mixing rate is given by    @xmath56    as it is the case with the mixing rate , the * mixing time * can be defined in several ways .",
    "basically , the notion of mixing time comprises the number of steps one must perform a classical discrete random walk before its distribution is close to its limiting distribution .",
    "+    * mixing time * _ @xcite_. let @xmath30 be an ergodic markov chain which induces a probability distribution @xmath57 on the states at time @xmath58 .",
    "also , let @xmath59 denote the limiting distribution of @xmath30 .",
    "the mixing time @xmath60 is then defined as    @xmath61 + where @xmath62 is a standard distance measure .",
    "for example , we could use the total variation distance , defined as @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the mixing time is defined as the first time @xmath58 such that @xmath57 is within distance @xmath64 of @xmath59 at all subsequent time steps @xmath65 , irrespective of the initial state .",
    "[ mixing_time ]    let us now provide two examples of hitting times on graphs .",

    "the results presented so far in this review show that superposition and , consequently , interference play an important role in the structure and properties of discrete quantum walks . however , interference is also a characteristic of classical physical systems , like electromagnetic waves .",

    "for example , the implementation proposed in @xcite utilizes the frequency of a light field as walker and the spatial path or the polarization state of the same light field as the coin .",
    "arguments in favor of the quantum mechanical nature of quantum walks have been provided by , among others , kendon and sanders @xcite who showed it would still be necessary to have a quantum mechanical description of such an implementation in order to account for two properties of a quantum walk with one walker : i ) the indivisibility of the quantum walker , and ii ) complementarity , which in quantum computation jargon may be stated as follows : _ the trade - off between interference and information about the path followed by the walker ( knowing the path followed by a quantum particle decreases the sharpness of the interference pattern @xcite . ) _ furthermore , romanelli _ et al _ showed in @xcite that the evolution equation of a quantum walk on a line can be separated into two parts : markovian and interference terms , and that the quadratic increase in the variance of the quantum walker is a consequence of quantum evolution .",
    "thus it seems that if we are only interested in some statistical properties of one - walker quantum walks on a line , like its variance enhancement with respect to classical random walks , we could do with either classical or quantum experimental setups .",
    "however , the quantum mechanical nature of walkers and/or coins play an important role in the following cases :    1 .   from a purely physical point of view , if one is interested in using quantum walks for testing the quantumness of a quantum computer realization , complementarity would be a very helpful resource as it is a property of quantum mechanical systems that can not be exactly reproduced in a classical experiment .",
