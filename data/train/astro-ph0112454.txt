    "the first mathematical descriptions of the effects of gravity , made by galileo in his study of the free fall of bodies and by kepler in his study of planetary motions , were purely empirical . though newton offered a coherent explanation of what was behind the laws governing gravitational effects , it was only with einstein s general relativity that we had an apparently complete theory of gravity .    however , at the end of the 20@xmath3 century , a new enigma concerning the motion of ` celestial bodies ' emerged , in particular , in studying rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "while newton s law of gravity predicts that the velocity of rotation in the interior of a galaxy should fall with increasing distance from the galactic center if the observed light traces mass , what is observed is the maintenance of a constant velocity with increasing radius , generating flat rotation curves @xcite .",
    "two simple ways of dealing with this problem have been suggested :    1 .   assuming that there is more mass ( _ i.e. _ , dark matter ) in galaxies than is observed ; 2 .   modifying the law of gravity .",
    "while much work has been done in the search for possible particle candidates for dark matter @xcite , very little has been done to explore the possibilities of modified gravity laws . until now",
    ", the most popular suggestion for a modified gravitational law has been modified newtonian dynamics , or , mond @xcite . in mond the acceleration @xmath4 of a body in an external gravitational field",
    "is not exactly equal to the acceleration @xmath5 obtained from the newtonian gravitational force .",
    "mathematically , one can write @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a dimensionless function of the ratio @xmath8 of the acceleration @xmath4 to an empirically determined constant @xmath9 . only in the limit",
    "@xmath10 is newtonian gravity restored .",
    "the strongest objection to mond is that it does not have a relativistic theory supporting it . for recent articles criticizing mond ,",
    "see scott _",
    "( 2001 ) @xcite and aguirre _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) @xcite .",
    "for a recent positive review of mond , see sanders ( 2001 ) @xcite .",
    "the objective of this letter is to expand the original mond proposal by presenting mathematical alternatives for the modified gravitational law .",
    "specifically , we present several alternative mathematical alternative formulations for the dimensionless function @xmath11 , thus following closer the structure of the pioneering work of mond by milgrom @xcite . in the next section we present the basics of mond .",
    "simulated rotation curves for several possible mondian - like functions are given in section [ sec : formulas ] .",
    "the final section presents some brief conclusions and perspectives for future work .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the original mond proposal uses the relation @xmath12 where @xmath5 is the usual newtonian acceleration and @xmath13 is a function which obeys @xmath14 therefore , in the limit of large accelerations , @xmath15 , the usual newtonian gravity law is obtained . in the other extreme , @xmath16 , however , we have @xmath17 thus , using @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the rotation velocity of the galaxy , @xmath20 which is a constant , as is observed for large galactic radii .",
    "it is common in the literature ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) to use the expression @xmath21 this formula , proposed by milgrom @xcite , has the advantage of being invertible . with it one",
    "can solve eq .",
    "( [ mond ] ) analytically for the acceleration @xmath4 and , consequently , for the rotation velocity @xmath19 as a function of the radius @xmath22 .",
    "however , other functions are also possible , and are discussed in the next section .",
    "in his work on the implications of mond for galaxies @xcite , milgrom used as a model for a spiral galaxy of total mass @xmath23 , a disc of mass @xmath24 and a central spheroidal bulge of mass @xmath25 .",
    "the fractional masses for the disc and the spherical bulge are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , so that the total fractional mass @xmath28 inside a radius @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xcite @xmath31 \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the incomplete gamma function . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are numerical constants .",
    "the dimensionless variable @xmath36 is the ratio of the radius @xmath22 to the characteristic length @xmath1 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath37 to @xmath1 , @xmath38 , is less than unity .",
    "the radii @xmath1 and @xmath37 are obtained , in practice , by adjusting the luminosity profiles of the spheroidal and disc components , using the empirical law of de vaucoulers for the spherical bulge and an exponential function for the disc .    following the mond proposal ,",
    "we define @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a dimensionless function with a dimensionless argument @xmath41 , similar to the @xmath11 of milgrom @xcite in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) .",
    "this new function @xmath42 is such that @xmath43 we investigate the following functions @xmath44 which obey the constraints of eq .",
    "( [ constraints ] ) : @xmath45 the behaviour of each of these functions as a function of @xmath46 can be seen in the expansions @xcite@xmath47 ^{-1 } & \\\\ & \\simeq 1 + 27y^2/45-\\left ( 27y/45\\right ) ^4+\\left ( 27y/45\\right ) ^6 + ... & \\left ( y\\ll 1\\right ) \\end{array } \\end{array } \\right.\\;\\;.\\ ] ] the functions are plotted in figure [ galmond4 ] .    using these functions , together with equations ( [ gamma ] ) ,",
    "( [ gammad ] ) and ( [ gamas ] ) , we obtain curves for the dimensionless rotation velocity @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 for different values of @xmath23 , @xmath50 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the curves are shown in figures [ galmond6 ] and [ galmond7 ] .",
    "inspection of figures [ galmond6 ] and [ galmond7 ] shows clearly that all the functions @xmath42 produce flat rotation curves .",
    "this is true not only for the particular values of @xmath23 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 of the figures , but for the entire range of physically reasonable values for these parameters .",
    "figure [ galmond7 ] shows that a comparison between the curves obtained , using the different @xmath53 functions presented , together with the original milgrom proposal ( eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) ) , may be useful to distinguish between them , since each curve has a peculiar feature in the region @xmath2",
    ".    it would be interesting to test the formulas presented here against observational data , noting that @xmath54 and @xmath52 are not free parameters , but are given by the luminosity profiles of the galaxies .",
    "the mass @xmath23 and the constant @xmath9 are the only free parameters to be adjusted .",
    "the study of different galaxies gives a single value for @xmath9 , the mass @xmath23 and the mass - luminosity ratio , @xmath55 , of each galaxy .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath56 can lead to different relativistic extensions of mond , important for future studies .",
    "for instance , using the expression for the gravitational potential @xmath57 , valid for purely radial forces , one can naively ascribe a @xmath58 to the modified gravitational laws obtained with @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for example , @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64 + \\varphi_0 \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is a constant of integration .",
    "therefore , in the search for a complete theory for mond , it is important to study alternative mondian functions .",
    "the mondian functions given in this letter can be seen as a step in this direction .",
