    "spintronics devices operate by detecting the spin of a carrier in the same way as a regular electronic device measures its electrical charge  @xcite .",
    "these devices are already the state of the art in the design of magnetic sensors such as the magnetic read - head of hard - disk drives  @xcite , but also have excellent prospect as logic gate elements  @xcite .",
    "logic circuits using the spin degree of freedom may offer low energy consumption and high speed owing to the fact that the dynamics of spins takes place at a much smaller energy scale than that of the charge  @xcite .",
    "recent years have also witnessed a marked increase in interest into investigations of organic molecules and molecular crystals as materials platform , initially for electronics  @xcite and lately also for spintronics  @xcite .",
    "the main reason behind such interest is that organic crystals , coming in a wide chemical variety , are typically much more flexible than their inorganic counterparts and they can exhibit an ample range of electronic properties , which are highly tuneable in practice .",
    "for example , it is possible to change the conductivity of organic polymers over fifteen orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "in addition to such extreme spectrum of physical / chemical properties organic materials are usually processed at low temperature .",
    "this is an advantage over inorganic compounds , which translates into a drastic reduction of the typical manufacturing and infrastructure costs  @xcite .",
    "finally , specific to spintronics is the fact that both the spin - orbit ( so ) and hyperfine interaction are very weak  @xcite in organic compounds , resulting in a weak spin scattering during the electron transport  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the type of media used , either organic or inorganic , spintronics always concerns phenomena related to the injection , manipulation and detection of spins into a solid state environment  @xcite . in the prototypical spintronic device , the spin - valve  @xcite ,",
    "a non - magnetic spacer is sandwiched between two ferromagnents .",
    "spins , which are initially aligned along the magnetization vector of the first ferromagnet , travel to the other ferromagnent through the spacer , and the resistance of the entire device depends on the relative orientation of the magnetization vectors of the two magnets .",
    "however , if the spin direction is lost across the spacer , the resistance will become independent of the magnetic configuration of the device .",
    "as such , in order to measure any spin - dependent effect one has to ensure that the charge carriers maintain their spin direction through the spacer .",
    "notably , this requirement is not only demanded by spin - valves , but also by any devices based on spins .",
    "there are several mechanism for spin - relaxation in the solid state  @xcite .    in an organic semiconductor ( osc ) the unwanted spin - relaxation",
    "can be caused by the presence of paramagnetic impurities , by so coupling and by hyperfine interaction .",
    "in general paramagnetic impurities can be controlled to a very high degree of precision and they can be almost completely eliminated from an osc during the chemical synthesis  @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine interaction instead can be usually considered small .",
    "this is because there are only a few elements typically present in organic molecules with abundant isotopes baring nuclear spins .",
    "the most obvious exception is hydrogen .",
    "however , most of the osc crystals are @xmath0-conjugated and the @xmath0-states , responsible for the extremal energy levels , and hence for the electron transport , are usually delocalized .",
    "this means that the overlap of the wave function over the h nuclei has to be considered small .",
    "finally , also the so coupling is weak owing to the fact that most of the atoms composing organic compounds are light .    as such ,",
    "since all the non - spin - conserving interactions are weak in oscs , it is not surprising that there is contradictory evidence concerning the interaction mostly responsible for spin - diffusion in organic crystals . conflicting experimental evidence exists supporting either the so coupling  @xcite or the hyperfine interaction  @xcite , indicating that the dominant mechanism may depend on the specific material under investigation .",
    "for this reason it is important to develop methods for determining the strength of both the so and the hyperfine coupling in real materials . these can eventually be the basis for constructing effective hamiltonians to be used for the evaluation of the relevant thermodynamics quantities ( e.g. the spin diffusion length ) .",
    "here we present one of such methods for the case of the so interaction .    the so interaction is a relativistic effect arising from the electron motion in the nuclear potential . in the electron reference frame",
    "the nucleus moves and creates a magnetic field , which in turn interacts with the electron spin .",
    "this is the spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "since the so interaction allows the spin of an electron to change direction during the electron motion , it is an interaction responsible for spin relaxation .",
    "in fact , there exist several so - based microscopic theories of spin relaxation in solid state systems  @xcite . in the case of inorganic semiconductors",
    "these usually require knowledge of the band - structure of the material , some information about its mobility and an estimate of the spin - orbit strength . in the case of oscs",
    "the situation , however , is more complex , mostly because the transport mechanism is more difficult to describe .",
    "firstly , the band picture holds true only for a few cases , while for many others one has to consider the material as an ensemble of weakly coupled molecules with a broad distribution of hopping integrals  @xcite . secondly , the typical phonon energies are of the same order of magnitude of the electronic band width , indicating that electron - phonon scattering can not be treated as a perturbation of the band structure . for all these reasons the description of the thermodynamical properties of oscs requires the construction of a multi - scale theory , where the elementary electronic structure is mapped onto an effective hamiltonian retaining only a handful of the original degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "a rigorous and now standard method for constructing such effective hamiltonian consists in calculating the band structure over a set of wannier functions  @xcite .",
    "these can be constructed in a very general way as the fourier transform of a linear combination of bloch states , where the linear combination is taken so to minimize the spatial extension of the wannier functions .",
    "these are the so - called maximally localized wannier fuctions ( mlwfs )  @xcite .",
    "the mlwf method performs best for well - isolated bands .",
    "this is indeed the case of oscs , where often the valence and conduction bands originate respectively from the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the gas - phase molecule .",
    "in fact , when the mlwf procedure is applied to such band structure one obtains wannier orbitals almost identical to the molecule homo and lumo  @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interaction , however , splits such well - defined bands , and in oscs the split is typically a few tenths of @xmath1ev .",
    "thus , in this case , one has to apply the mlwf procedure to bands , which are indistinguishable at an energy scale larger then a few @xmath1ev . in such conditions",
    "the minimization becomes almost impossible to converge , the mlwfs can not be calculated for so - split bands and an alternative scheme must be implemented .    here",
    "we describe a method for obtaining the so matrix elements with respect to the wannier functions calculated in the absence of the so interaction .",
    "since the so coupling in oscs is weak , such spin - independent wannier functions represent a close approximation of those that one could , at least in principle , obtain in the presence of the so interaction .",
    "furthermore , when the mlwf basis spans the same hilbert space defined by all the atomic orbitals relevant for describing a given bands manifold , our method provides an accurate description of the system even in the case of heavy elements , i.e. for strong spin - orbit interaction .",
    "in particular we implement our scheme together with the atomic - orbital , pseudopotential , density functional theory ( dft ) code siesta  @xcite .",
    "siesta is used to generate the band structure in absence of the spin - orbit interaction and for calculating the so potential , while the mlwf procedure is performed with the wannier90 code  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe our method in detail , by starting from the general idea and then going into the specific numerical implementation . a how - to workflow will also be presented .",
    "next we discuss results obtained for rather diverse physical systems .",
    "firstly , we evaluate the so - split energy eigenvalues of a plumbane molecule and show how accurately these match those obtained directly from dft including so interaction .",
    "then , we apply our procedure to the calculation of the band structure of a chain of pb atoms , before moving to materials composed of light elements with low so coupling . here",
    "we will show that our method performs well for chains made of carbon atoms and of methane molecules .",
    "finally we obtain the so matrix elements for the wannier functions derived from the homo band of a triarylamine - based nanowire , a relatively well - known semiconducting material with potential applications in photo - voltaic  @xcite and spintronics .",
    "here we describe the idea behind our method , which is general and does not depend on the specific implementation used for calculating the band structure .",
    "consider a set of @xmath2 isolated bloch states , @xmath3 , describing an infinite lattice .",
    "these for instance can be the dft kohn - sham eigenstates of a crystal .",
    "one can then obtain the associated @xmath2 wannier functions from the definition , @xmath4e^{-i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}d\\mathbf{k}\\ : , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the @xmath6-th wannier vector centred at the lattice site @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the volume of the primitive cell and the integration is performed over the first brillouin zone ( bz ) . in eq .",
    "( [ equ1 ] ) @xmath9 is a unitary operator that mixes the bloch states and hence defines the specific set of wannier functions .",
    "a particularly convenient gauge choice for @xmath9 consists in minimizing the wannier functions spread , which writes @xmath10\\ : .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] such choice defines the so - called maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) .    in the absence of so coupling a wannier function of spin @xmath11",
    "is composed exclusively of bloch states with the same spin , @xmath11 . by moving from a continuos to a discrete @xmath12-point representation the spin - polarized version of eq .",
    "( [ equ1 ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath13 note that this represents either a finite periodic lattice comprising @xmath14 unit cells or a sampling of @xmath14 uniformly distributed @xmath12-points in the brillouin zone of an infinite lattice . here",
    "the bloch states , which are normalized within each unit cell according to the relation @xmath15 , obey to the condition @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the bloch function for the @xmath18-th band at the wavevector * k * and position @xmath19 .",
    "the projection of a generic bloch state onto a mlwf in the absence of so coupling can be written as @xmath20 hence a generic so matrix element can be expanded over the mlwf basis set as @xmath21 where @xmath22 it must be noted that in the absence of so coupling , the bloch states are spin - degenerate , i.e. there are two states corresponding to each spatial wave - function , one with spin up , @xmath23 , and one with spin down , @xmath24 . the same is true for the wannier functions , i.e. one has always the pair @xmath25 , @xmath26 . in the presence of so coupling ,",
    "spin mixing occurs and each bloch and wannier state is , in general , a linear combination of both spin vectors . since the bloch states ( or the wannier ones ) obtained in the absence of so coupling form a complete basis set in the hilbert space , the so coupling operator can be written over such basis provided that one takes both spins into account .",
    "therefore we use such spin - degenerate states as our basis for all calculations .      the derivation leading to eq .",
    "( [ equ11 ] ) is general and the final result is simply a matrix transformation of the so operator from the basis of the bloch states to that of wannier ones . note that both basis sets are those calculated in the absence of so coupling , i.e. we have assumed that the spatial part of the basis function is not modified by the introduction of the so interaction . for practical purposes we",
    "now we wish to re - write eq .",
    "( [ equ11 ] ) in terms of a localized atomic - orbital basis set , i.e. we wish to make our method applicable to first - principles dft calculations implemented over local orbitals .",
    "in particular all the calculations that will follow use the siesta package , which expands the wave - function and all the operators over a numerical atomic - orbital basis sets , \\{@xmath27 } , where @xmath28 denotes the @xmath29-th atomic orbital ( @xmath1 is a collective label for the principal and angular momentum quantum numbers ) with spin @xmath30 belonging to the cell at the position @xmath31 . siesta uses relativistic pseudopotentials to generate the spin - orbit matrix elements with respect to the basis vectors and truncates the range of the so interaction to the on - site terms  @xcite . for a finite periodic lattice comprising @xmath14 unit cells ,",
    "a bloch state is written with respect to atomic orbitals as @xmath32 where the coefficients @xmath33 are in general c - numbers .",
    "this state is normalized over the entire lattice with the allowed @xmath34-values being @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the reciprocal lattice vector and @xmath37 is an integer .",
    "hence the so matrix elements written with respect to the spin - degenerate bloch states calculated in absence of so interaction are @xmath38 as mentioned above siesta neglects all the so matrix elements between atomic orbitals located at different atoms .",
    "this leads to the approximation @xmath39 so that eq .",
    "( [ equ4 ] ) becomes @xmath40 this can be further simplified by taking into account the relation @xmath41 which leads to the final expression for the so matrix elements @xmath42    with the result of eq .",
    "( [ equ8 ] ) at hand we can now come back to the expression for the so matrix elements written over the mlwfs computed in absence of spin - orbit [ see eq .",
    "( [ equ11 ] ) ] . in the case of the siesta basis set",
    "this now reads @xmath43 finally , we go back to the continuous representation ( @xmath44 ) , where the sum over * k * is replaced by an integral over the first brillouin zone @xmath45    to summarize , our strategy consists in simply evaluating the so matrix elements over the basis set of the mlwfs constructed in the absence of so interaction .",
    "these are by definition spin - degenerate and they are in general easy to compute since associated to well - separated bands .",
    "our procedure thus avoids to run the minimization algorithm necessary to fix the wannier s gauge over the so - split bands , which in the case of oscs have tiny splits .",
    "our method is exact in the case the mlwfs form a complete set describing a particular bands manifold . in other circumstances",
    "they constitute a good approximation , as long as the so interaction is weak , namely when it does not change significantly the spatial shape of the wannier functions .",
    "the following procedure is adopted when calculating the so - split band structures from the mlwfs hamiltonian .",
    "the results are then compared to the band structure obtained directly from siesta including so interaction .    1 .",
    "we first run a self - consistent non - collinear spin - dft siesta calculation and obtain the band structure .",
    "2 .   from the density matrix obtained at step ( 1 ) , we run a non self - consistent single - step siesta calculation including so coupling .",
    "this gives us the matrix elements @xmath46 .",
    "the band structure obtained in this calculation ( from now on this is called the so - dft band structure ) will be then compared with that obtained over the mlwfs .",
    "note that we do not perform the siesta dft calculation including spin - orbit interaction in a self - consistent way .",
    "this is because the so interaction changes little the density matrix so that such calculation is often not necessary .",
    "furthermore , as we can not run the mlwf calculation in a self - consistent way over the so interaction , considering non - self - consistent so band structure at the siesta level allows us to compare electronic structures arising from identical charge densities .",
    "3 .   since the current version of wannier90 implemented for siesta works only with collinear spins , we run a regular self - consistent spin - polarized siesta calculation .",
    "this gives us the coefficients @xmath47 , which are spin - degenerate for a non - magnetic material , @xmath48 .",
    "we run a wannier90 calculation to construct the mlwfs associated to the band structure computed at point ( 3 ) .",
    "this returns us the unitary matrix , @xmath49 , the hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the kohn - sham hamiltonian in absence of so interaction ) and the phase factors   and @xmath52 is easily verified by ensuring that the following relation is satisfied @xmath53 ] @xmath52 . for a non - magnetic material the matrix elements of @xmath51 satisfy the relation @xmath54 .",

    "the final complete wannier hamiltonian now reads @xmath57 and the associated band structure can be directly compared with that computed at point ( 2 ) directly from siesta .",
    "we now present our results , which are discussed in the light of the theory just described .",
    "we start our analysis by calculating the so matrix elements and then the energy eigenvalues of a plumbane , pbh@xmath58 , molecule [ see figure  [ fig:3_structures](a ) ] .",

    "clearly in this case of a heavy ion the so coupling changes the eigenvalues appreciably , in particular in the spectral region around -13  ev . such change is well captured by our wannier calculation , which returns energy levels in close proximity to those computed with so - dft by siesta . in order to estimate the error introduced by our method",

    "the eigenvalues reported in table  [ table : plumbane ] are the ten with the lowest energies . however , in order to construct the mlwfs we have considered all the states of the calculated kohn - sham spectrum .",

    "importantly , one in general may expect that the so interaction matrix elements between different kohn - sham orbitals , @xmath68 , are smaller than those calculated at the same orbital , @xmath69 .",
    "this is because of the short - range of the so interaction and the fact that the kohn - sham eigenstates are orthonormal . in the case of light elements ,",
    "i.e. for a weak so potential , one may completely neglect the off - diagonal so matrix elements .",
    "this means that the so spectrum constructed with the mlwfs associated to the first @xmath2 eigenstates will be approximately equal to the first @xmath2 eigenvalues of the mlwfs hamiltonian constructed over the entire @xmath14-dimensional spectrum .",

    "however , we should note that the truncation still needs to be carefully chosen . here for instance we have considered all the 2@xmath30 and 2@xmath18 bands and neglected those with either higher principal quantum number ( e.g. 3@xmath30 and 3@xmath18 ) or higher angular momentum ( e.g. bands with @xmath118 symmetry originating from the @xmath18-polarized siesta basis ) , which appear at much higher energies .",
    "truncations , where one considers only a particular orbital of a given shell ( say the @xmath100 orbital in an @xmath119 shell ) , need to be carefully assessed since it is unlikely that a clear energy separation between the bands takes place .",
    "[ fig : c_bs ]      as a first basic prototype of 1d organic molecular crystal we perform calculations for a periodic chain of methane molecules .",
    "we use a double - zeta polarized basis set and a lda - relaxed unit cell length of 3.45     ( the cell contains only one molecule ) . similarly to the previous case , the mlwfs are constructed over only the lowest 4 bands ( 8 when considering the spin degeneracy ) . when compared to the bands of the carbon chain , those of methane are much narrower .",

    "clearly such split is orders of magnitude smaller than the value that one can possibly calculate by a direct construction of the mlwfs from the so - splitted band structure .",
    "note also that the so split of the valence band is calculated here approximately a factor ten smaller than that estimated previously for a n atomic chain  @xcite , indicating the importance of the details of the chemical environment in these calculations .",
    "finally we take a closer look at the calculated so matrix elements .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in the siesta on - site approximation  @xcite only the matrix elements calculated over orbitals centred on the same atom do not vanish . as a consequence the components @xmath131 drop to zero as @xmath132 gets large .",
    "this can be clearly appreciated in fig .",

    "in general any expectation value of @xmath134 , @xmath135 , has to be real .",
    "this is in fact anti - symmetric with respect to * k * , i.e we have @xmath136 , where @xmath137 denotes the @xmath105 point of the brillouin zone .",

    "hence , by performing the * k*-sum over first brillouin zone we can write @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the expectation value of @xmath134 and must be real .",

    "[ fig : triarylamine_spinorbit](b ) that for triarylamine the matrix elements @xmath142 are almost zero for @xmath143 .",
    "this follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ equ20 ] ) .",
    "in fact in the particular case of triarylamine nanowires the wannier functions are constructed from one band only . as such , in order to have a non - zero matrix element , @xmath142 , we must have non - zero values for @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the band under consideration must contain an appreciable mix of components of both the @xmath145 and @xmath146 complex spherical harmonics for some @xmath147 and @xmath18 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the triarylamine homo band is composed mostly of @xmath100 n orbitals .",
    "hence , it has to be expected that the @xmath142 matrix elements are small .",
    "we have presented an accurate method for obtaining the so matrix elements between the mlwfs constructed in absence of so coupling .",
    "our procedure , implemented within the atomic - orbital - based dft code siesta , allows one to avoid the construction of the wannier functions over the so - split band structure . in some cases , in particular for organic crystals , such splits are tiny and a direct construction is numerically impossible .",
    "the method is then put to the test for a number of materials systems , going from isolated molecules , to atomic nanowires , to 1d molecular crystals . when the entire band manifold is used for constructing the mlwfs the mapping between bloch and wannier orbitals",
    "is exact and the method can be used for both light and heavy elements .",
    "in contrast for weak spin - orbit interaction one can construct the mlwfs on a subset of the states in the band structures without any loss of accuracy . as such our scheme appears as an important tool for constructing effective spin hamiltonians for organic materials to be used as input in a multiscale approach to the their thermodynamical properties",
