    "the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) provides a large well - defined sample @xcite of faint galaxies for which the selection criteria match as closely as possible those for samples of nearby galaxies .",
    "the galaxies in the cfrs have a median redshift of @xmath4 , which corresponds to a look - back time of half the present age of the universe .",
    "the sample gives information on the evolution of galaxy morphology over the range @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it therefore supplements similar studies of the evolution of galaxy morphology in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) @xcite and its flanking fields ( ff ) by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "such additional information is of value because ( 1 ) the numbers of galaxies in individual classification bins is small , and ( 2 ) the distribution of classification types along any particular line of sight may be affected by the presence of voids or density enhancements .",
    "a catalog of classifications on the ddo system @xcite of 229 galaxies for which redshifts have been published by @xcite is given in table 1 .",
    "not listed in table 1 are 17 objects with redshift @xmath6 which were mostly classified as e0 , e0/star or star .",
    "exceptions are cfrs 10.0808 , which was classified as peculiar , and cfrs 10.1614 which is a distant sab / s0 : galaxy , even though its redshift is claimed to be 0.0000 on the basis of the resemblance of its spectrum to that of an m - type star .",
    "infrared f814w images obtained with the hubble space telescope wide field planetary camera 2 were available for all of the classified galaxies . for many of these galaxies",
    "a red f606w image had also been obtained .",
    "finally a few blue f450w images were also available .",
    "since these blue images were generally `` underexposed '' they were mostly only useful to show the distribution of the young population component in program galaxies .",
    "inspection of ( and classification from ) the f814w and f606w images showed that , for galaxies with @xmath7 , the classifications were only weakly dependent on the rest- wavelength at which they were being viewed .",
    "the classification effects were in the sense that objects viewed at a rest - wavelength longer than that of the b band ( @xmath8 ) appeared to have bulges that were too large and spiral arms that were too weak .",
    "only for a few galaxies at @xmath9 are morphological classifications expected to be seriously affected by young blue stars . to minimize the effects of rest - wavelength on the classifications , all galaxies with @xmath10 were classified on the f814w images .",
    "galaxies with @xmath11 where , whenever possible , classified on f606w images .",
    "a small number of objects with @xmath12 were classified on the f450w images .",
    "galaxies which were classified at ( or close to ) the rest - frame b wavelength are marked by an asterisk in the fourth colum of table 1 .",
    "uncertain classifications are followed by a colon .",
    "the exposure times for the f814w images used in the cfrs survey ranged from 5300 to 7800 seconds .",
    "the corresponding exposure times of f814w images in the hubble deep field @xcite were 124000 seconds . as a result of this difference in exposure times the cfrs images are noisier than the hdf images .",
    "this difference makes the classification of the cfrs images somewhat more challenging than that of the galaxies in the hdf .",
    "however , it is our impression that this difference is not likely to introduce significant systematic differences between classifications in the cfrs and in the hdf . by introducing artificial noise @xcite",
    "have found that such noise does not significantly influence the classifications of the main bodies of galaxies .",
    "however , the visibility of dim outer features , such as faint outer tidal structure , does depend on the noise level in each image . as was the case for the previous classifications of objects in the hdf , it was usually not possible to distinguish with confidence between elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies .",
    "furthermore a few distant cd galaxies might have been misclassified as objects of types e - sa - sab . for distant spirals",
    "it is often difficult to use spiral arm morphology as a classification criterion .",
    "this is so because of resolution effects on the tightly coiled arms of early - type galaxies , and because the arms of distant late - type galaxies often appear to have a rather chaotic structure .",
    "central concentration of light has therefore been used as the principal criterion for locating an individual object on hubble s ( 1936 ) sa - sb - sc sequence . those galaxies with the largest nuclear bulges",
    "were assigned to type sa , those with somewhat smaller bulges were classified as being of type sb , and spirals exhibiting the smallest bulges were designated sc .",
    "finally , galaxies lacking a nucleus or nuclear bulge were generally classified as irregulars .",
    "all classifications were made `` blind '' , i.e. without knowing what the redshift of that galaxy was .",
    "@xcite previously classified many of the galaxies in the present program on the sequence : 1 = e + e / s0 , 2 = s0/sa , 3 = sab , 4 = sbc , 5 = scd , and 6= ir .",
    "their classifications were made with respect to nine fundamental types that are illustrated in their figure 4 after excluding star - like objects , and those classifications marked `` ? '' , there were 147 galaxies that that had been classified 1 to 6 by binchmann et al . and e- e / sa - sa - sab - sb - sbc - sc - sc / ir - ir in table 1 . after translating our classifications into the slightly coarser sequence of binchmann et al .",
    "it is found ( see figure 1 ) that 79/147 ( 54% ) of the classifications differ by 0.5 units or less .",
    "such close agreement is considered satisfactory because it is often difficult to fit the morphologies of distant galaxies into the classification bins of the hubble ( 1936 ) scheme @xcite .",
    "furthermore inspection of figure 1 shows no evidence for a significant systematic difference between the present classifications on the ddo system and those by binchmann et al .",
    "it should , however , be noted that quite a few galaxies that binchmann et al .",
    "classify as 6 ( irregular ) were regarded as mergers in the present investigation . in most of these cases",
    "careful inspection of the images shows the presence of two ( or more ) nuclei .",
    "the best example of an interacting pair that was classified as an irregular is cfrs 14.1129 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this object seems to consist of a late - type spiral that is being tidally distorded by a compact early - type companion .",
    "figure 3 shows a histogram of the distribution in redshift of the galaxies in the present sample .",
    "the figure shows an increase by about 40% in the number of galaxies per redshift bin between z = 0.0 and z = 1.0 , and then a precipitous drop , which is no doubt due to incompleteness of our sample , beyond @xmath13 .",
    "the fact that the present sample was drawn from objects located in four different fields reduces the effects of galaxy clustering along the line of sight to any individual field .",
    "figure 4 compares the distribution of spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "inspection of this figure suggests , and a kolmogorov- smirnov test confirms , that these two distributions do not differ at a respectable level of statistical significance .",
    "inspection of this figure suggests , and a kolmogorov - smirnov test confirms , that these two distributions do not differ at a respectable level of statistical significance . by the same token it is found that the redshift distributions of the 35 e galaxies and of 19.5 spirals of type sc in the cfrs sample do not differ at a statistically significant level .      in a previous paper @xcite it",
    "was found that a number of the objects that had tentatively been designated as `` mergers '' had significantly different radial velocities and were therefore close optical pairs .",
    "it was therefore decided to tighten the definition of mergers by restricting it to galaxies that exhibited clear evidence for tidal distortion , or to close pairs that are embedded in a common envelope . in agreement with previous work ( see carlberg et al .",
    "2000 for a recent review ) it is found that the fraction of merging galaxies is highest at the largest redshifts . in the present sample 9/22 ( 41% ) of all merging galaxies are located at @xmath14 , whereas only 38/203 ( 19% ) of non- merging galaxies have @xmath15 .",
    "van den bergh _",
    "( 1996 ) found that barred spirals were unexpectedly rare in the hubble deep field north .",
    "subsequently @xcite noted a striking decline in the fraction of barred spirals beyond redshifts of 0.5 - 0.7 in the hubble deep field south .",
    "furthermore observations at a fixed rest - frame wavelength @xcite appear to show that this deficiency of barred spirals at large redshifts can not , as had been suggested by @xcite , be attributed to wavelength dependent visibility of bars .",
    "van den bergh _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) found that only 6% of 49 galaxies with @xmath16 had bars or possible bars .",
    "furthermore only 1% of 134 galaxies with redshifts in the range @xmath17 appeared to exhibit bar - like structure .",
    "[ the single barred spiral at z = 0.96 might actually be a tidally deformed normal spiral . ] for comparison it is noted that 22% of the nearby galaxies in the shapley ames catalog @xcite are listed as being barred objects of types sb or s(b ) .",
    "it is presently being investigated ( abraham & van den bergh in preparation ) to which extent the fraction of galaxies that is recognized as being barred spirals might depend on redshift via resolution and noise - dependent effects . in the present study special attention",
    "was paid to the presence ( or absence ) of bars , by examining each galaxy image over the widest possible dynamical range .",
    "it is therefore surprising that only 14 out of 225 ( 6% ) galaxies in the cfrs sample are seen to have bars .",
    "unfortunately the present sample is too small to establish if the fraction of barred galaxies decreases still more towards increasing redshift .",
    "galaxies of ddo luminosity classes i and ii exhibit beautifull long arms and are commonly denoted as `` grand design '' spirals .",
    "inspection of src schmidt plates @xcite shows that such spiral arms can still be recognized on the tiny schmidt images of galaxies with redshifts of 10 000 @xmath18 15 000 km s@xmath19 .",
    "such arms are also clearly seen in the reproduction of galaxy cfrs 10.0826 at z= 0.64 , which binchmann et al . use as their prototype for galaxies of type scd .",
    "the present sample contains only six grand - design spirals , three of wich have redshifts @xmath20 .",
    "our sample is therefore too small to study the redshift distribution on grand - design spirals .",
    "the relative frequencies of differing morphological galaxy types in different redshift ranges are listed in table 2 .",
    "the interpretation of these data is rendered particularly uncertain by the fact that 185 galaxies are sorted into nine morphological bins in three redshift ranges .",
    "on average each bin in the table therefore contains only @xmath21 ( 185/27 ) galaxies !",
    "the only relatively secure conclusion to be drawn from the data in table 2 is that the total number of objects classified as peculiar , `` ? ''",
    ", protogalaxy and merger appears to increase with redshift . also given in table 2",
    "is a comparison between the relative frequencies of various galaxy classification types in the present cfrs sample and in the hubble deep field plus flanking fields studied by @xcite .",
    "no gross differences appear to show up between the frequency distributions of morphological types in these two samples .",
    "since the present data on cfrs galaxies have been classified on the same system as those in the hubble deep field @xcite the cfrs and the hdf+ff samples may be combined .",
    "this has two advantages . in the first place the size of the sample is approximately doubled .",
    "secondly combining samples observed along different lines of sight reduces the bias that could be introduced by the fact that a particular line of sight might pass through an overdensity , in which early - type galaxies are expected to be over - represented @xcite .",
    "data on the resulting frequency distribution of morphological types of 425 galaxies with @xmath22 is collected in table 3 .",
    "subject to the inevitable limitations of small number statistics it appears that the following tentative conclusions may be drawn from the data in this table :    * the fraction of e + s0 + e / s0 galaxies remains approximately constant at @xmath23 over the range z = 0.25 to z = 1.20 . *",
    "the fraction of irregular galaxies appears to increase slightly from @xmath24 at small redshifts to @xmath25 at z @xmath261 .",
    "this is the opposite of what might have been expected from observational selection .",
    "this is so because ir galaxies are , on average , significantly fainter than those of hubble types e - sa- sb - sc ( see fig.1 of van den bergh 1998 ) .",
    "this suggests that either ( 1 ) irregular galaxies were intrinsically more frequent in the distant past than they are now , or ( perhaps more plausibly ) ( 2 ) that ir galaxies experienced more luminosity evolution than did objects of types e - sa - sb - sc .",
    "however , some constraints on such luminosity evolution are set by the observation @xcite that that star forming galaxies at @xmath27 do not appear to have the extremely low metallicities that are diagnostic of dwarf galaxies . *",
    "the frequency of galaxy mergers appears to increase by a factor of two or three over the range @xmath28 .",
    "a significant fraction of the distant objects , that had previously been classified as irregulars , turn out to be mergers .",
    "the present investigation suggests that larger galaxy samples , that are drawn from separate fields in the sky , will be needed to derive statistically significant conclusions on the redshift dependence of ( 1 ) the merger rate , ( 2 ) the fraction of grand - design spirals and ( 3 ) the fraction of barred spirals .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank simon lilly for kindly providing the hst images of cfrs galaxies and to peter stetson for his help with help with the reduction of these images .",
    "i also thank roberto abraham and simon lilly for critical reading of an early draft of this paper .",
