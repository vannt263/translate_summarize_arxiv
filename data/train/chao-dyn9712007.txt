    "hereafter we consider intermittency in case of one - dimensional noninvertible mappings .",
    "correlation functions may then be expressed in terms of the spectral properties of the frobenius - perron operator @xmath0 , defined by @xmath1 here @xmath2 is an arbitrary function , @xmath3 stands for the mapping function and @xmath4 labels the inverse branches . the power law decay is associated with an accumulation point at the upper edge of the spectrum that causes serious difficulties at direct numerical studies of the spectral properties .",
    "moreover , we have found that the corresponding eigenvectors tend to become approximately parallel , that greatly reduces the number of eigenstates which can be extracted from a finite size matrix representation@xcite .",
    "therefore , a suitable analytical treatment is needed which does not involve any truncations .",
    "such a method has already been applied in refs.@xcite , @xcite . here",
    "we present another approach which is based on a suitable infinite matrix representation .",
    "this method has the advantage that it approximately reduces the problem to the well known radial schrdinger equation for _ s_-states .",
    "mathematically significant is the fact that the original problem is transformed into an equivalent one which admits a nearly hermitian representation .",
    "therefore , beyond the interesting analogy , our method renders possible the application of standard perturbation theory as a tool for a systematic calculation of corrections .",
    "this results in a rather high accuracy for the spectral properties , as we shall demonstrate .",

    "it turns out that the main features of the spectrum and the eigenfunctions depend only on the behavior of the map near the unstable fixed point @xmath7 when @xmath8 is close to @xmath9 , thus our results have a broader relevance , in fact , they bear in a sense a universal character@xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the intermittent situation ( @xmath6 ) is discussed , especially , contact is made with the quantum mechanical @xmath10-scattering on a coulomb potential at zero energy . in section",
    "iii the nearly intermittent ( @xmath11 ) situation is considered .",
    "the problem is reduced approximately to the bound @xmath10-states in a coulomb potential .",
    "correction terms are calculated by standard quantum mechanical perturbation theory .",
    "approaching intermittency , the number of the eigenstates essentially involved in the representation of a correlation function tends to the infinity , therefore the calculation of correlation functions is highly nontrivial , even if the spectral properties are already known@xcite . in section",
    "iv we present and discuss an analytic expression for correlation functions , that is relevant near intermittency .",
    "the detailed derivation can be found in appendix b. a discussion of the results is given in the concluding section v. appendix a contains an outline and discussion of the numerical method for calculating corrections in the intermittent situation .",
    "one conclusion of our numerical study done on the family of maps ( [ e1.1 ] ) has been that finite size matrix approximations are poor near and at the intermittent situation , hence if one wants to get the spectral properties in those cases reliably , some other method is needed which does not involve any truncations of the matrix representations . as a first step we have chosen for an analytical study the intermittent map @xmath12 corresponding to @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ e1.1 ] ) . using the basis @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 ) , one obtains for the @xmath15-th matrix element of the frobenius - perron - operator ( [ e1.0 ] ) the simple closed expression @xmath16 these matrix elements are displayed in fig .",
    "1 . our aim is to find an asymptotical solution to the eigenvalue equation , i.e. an expression of the eigenvector for large @xmath17-values , as the failure of the numerical calculation implies that this numerically inaccessible part of the eigenvector plays an inevitable role .",
    "the matrix representation ( [ e2.2 ] ) also supports this expectation as the largest matrix elements lie at the diagonal and decay with @xmath17 as @xmath18 , while the strip of the non - negligible matrix elements along the diagonal has a width of @xmath19 .",
    "thus any truncation leads to a dramatic effect . using stirling s formula for the factorials arising in eq .",
    "( [ e2.2 ] ) for large @xmath17 and @xmath20 the @xmath21 matrix element is approximately given by @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 ) , this expression being accurate up to the order @xmath24 .",
    "the quality of the approximation is demonstrated in fig .",
    "2 , where the difference between the asymptotical expression ( [ e2.3 ] ) and the exact values ( [ e2.2 ] ) is shown . retaining only the gaussian , we find the approximate eigenvectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 both belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath27 this can be proven by inserting the above asymptotic expressions into the eigenvalue equation , replacing the summation over @xmath28 with integration and evaluating it by using the saddle point method .",
    "the reason why we get this twofold degeneracy can be understood as a result of the asymptotical method which formally allows @xmath17 and @xmath28 to take on negative values as well , thus the situation is analogous with the continuous spectrum of a quantum particle performing unbounded one - dimensional motion .",
    "actually these solutions get corrections near the origin ( i.e. , at @xmath29 ) , where the asymptotic expansion of @xmath21 does not hold , and , on the other hand they combine in a particular way to cancel each other for @xmath30 . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum will not be degenerated , but is continuous . using a quantum mechanical analogy again",
    ", the situation resembles to a one dimensional scattering process of a particle on a potential containing a hard core .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the asymptotic regime corresponds to the laminar motion in the original @xmath31-representation , as for large @xmath28 the basis functions @xmath32 are sharply peaked at the origin ( which is now a marginally unstable fixed point ) and nearly vanish elsewhere .",
    "the nonasymptotic regime , on the other hand , corresponds to the chaotic motion .",
    "hence in this representation we are given a picture about intermittency that relates it to a scattering process , where the motion near the scattering potential corresponds to chaos .",
    "as we shall see later , in the nonintermittent situation one has to do with bound states in such a potential .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that we have a discrete spectrum in that case",
    ".    nevertheless , the above asymptotic solutions are not very precise numerically . to improve this approximation , one may seek for corrections proportional to @xmath33 and to @xmath34 . in order to get them",
    ", one has to take into account corrections to the saddle point method , which means that one uses eq .",
    "( [ e2.3 ] ) and retains terms like those proportional to @xmath35 which give a contribution when averaging them with the gaussian .",
    "it turns out , however , that these corrections are proportional to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , for @xmath38 , i.e. , the correction terms diverge as the eigenvalue approaches @xmath9 ( which is the most interesting situation for us ) . on the other hand , the improved solution shows a remarkable feature , namely , that for small @xmath39 it depends on @xmath39 and on @xmath28 only through the combination @xmath40 : @xmath41 if one demands this dependence from the beginning and assumes that @xmath42 while no assumption is made about @xmath43 , then one gets up to order @xmath24 in @xmath17 and to order @xmath44 in @xmath39 ( defined now through eq .",
    "( [ e2.6 ] ) ) the equation @xmath45 ( @xmath46 standing for @xmath47 ) whose two linearly independent solutions are ( cf . @xcite ) @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 standing for the first order bessel and neumann functions , respectively .",
    "( [ e2.8 ] ) is identical with the radial schrdinger equation for @xmath10-wave scattering in a coulomb potential at zero energy . as discussed above",
    ", it is valid far from the chaotic core of the effective scattering potential which for small values of @xmath28 gives rise to corrections .",
    "we shall see , however , that the range of validity of eq .",
    "( [ e2.8 ] ) extends down to @xmath52 when @xmath53 .",
    "the boundary conditions follow from the restrictions that the eigenfunctions in the original @xmath31-space should have an integrable singularity at @xmath54 and their integral over the whole @xmath55 $ ] interval should vanish .",
    "this latter follows from the orthogonality of the left and right eigenfunctions ( belonging to different eigenvalues ) and from the fact that the identically @xmath9 function is the left eigenfunction of the frobenius - perron operator for @xmath56 ( i.e. , for @xmath57 ) .",
    "note that it is valid only in the case of permanent chaos and does not apply for transient chaos .",
    "the eigenfunction of the frobenius - perron operator is given by @xmath58 where the asymptotical form of @xmath59 is given by some linear combination of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see eqs.([e2.9]),([e2.10 ] ) ) .",
    "as the asymptotical form of both the bessel and the neumann function is a phase - shifted sinus with a one - over - square - root type amplitude , for fixed @xmath39 and increasing @xmath17 the moduli of the coefficients @xmath59 grow like @xmath62 .",
    "this growing is , however , superimposed by the exponential decay of the @xmath63 factor , making the infinite sum in eq .",
    "( [ e2.11 ] ) absolutely convergent for @xmath64 .",
    "one can even show that the eigenfunction @xmath65 is integrable near zero ( one estimates the summation with an integral , after a term - by - term integration over @xmath31 ) .",
    "this is true essentially because @xmath66 is finite .",
    "one can express the requirement of the integrability of the eigenfunction near zero as a boundary condition to eq .",
    "( [ e2.8 ] ) stating that @xmath67 is finite ( the lower limit of the integration range being an arbitrary positive value ) .",
    "thus we can say that both propagating solutions ( [ e2.9 ] ) and ( [ e2.10 ] ) of eq .  ( [ e2.8 ] ) are allowed by the boundary condition at the infinity , as is usually the case in the customary scattering problems .",
    "the next issue is how one can determine the actual eigenvector @xmath59 for a given ( small ) @xmath39 knowing the asymptotical solutions @xmath68 .",
    "the asymptotical solutions are actually rather accurate approximations even for small @xmath17-s when @xmath39 is small .",
    "nevertheless , at or near @xmath69 they do not satisfy the eigenvalue equation , thus giving rise to a correction term .",
    "if one starts with the proper linear combination of the two asymptotic solutions , then the correction term rapidly decays .",
    "this is the condition which selects the proper asymptotics .",
    "( if , however , not the proper linear combination has been chosen , then the correction term itself contains an asymptotic part , describing a reflection at the origin @xmath69 . )",
    "the numerical procedure is outlined and discussed in appendix a. according to those considerations , for small @xmath39 , i.e. , for an eigenvalue near unity the eigenfunction has the form @xmath70 ( here we have multiplied by @xmath71 in order to exhibit the similarity to the @xmath56 case when just the first term of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ e2.19 ] ) remains . )",
    "the sum may be evaluated by replacing it with an integral . neglecting terms proportional to @xmath44 times a nonsingular function ( which come from the derivatives of the summand at @xmath69 when the euler - maclaurin summation formula is applied )",
    "one obtains ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath72 for @xmath73 the second term vanishes everywhere except near @xmath54 , where it has a sharp peak with unit area .",
    "as the first term is nothing but the normalized stationary probability density of the map ( which is at the same time the eigenfunction of the frobenius - perron operator with unit eigenvalue ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) , one can see in which sense the limiting eigenfunction is approached and also , that the integral of the eigenfunction over @xmath31 vanishes .",
    "one can see now that the spectral properties around the upper edge of the spectrum depend predominantly on the laminar motion of the map near its marginally unstable fixed point , as the influence of the other parts of the map can show up itself through correction terms , which , however , become negligible when the eigenvalue approaches unity . on the other hand , corrections for larger values of @xmath39",
    "can be calculated with relatively little numerical efforts as the nondecaying asymptotical part of the eigenvectors ( which has been previously the root of the numerical difficulties ) is already taken into account analytically .",
    "we seek for the asymptotical form of the matrix elements @xmath21 of the frobenius - perron operator @xmath0 corresponding to the family of maps ( [ e1.1 ] ) on the basis @xmath74 this form is suggested by the symmetry of the map as well as by the structure of the frobenius - perron operator ( [ e1.0 ] ) .",

    "they coincide with those given above ( eq .  ( [ e3.0 ] ) ) .",

    "our starting point now is eq .",

    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "3 .    in order to derive an asymptotical analytical approximation",

    "( [ e3.2b ] ) ( each involving one of the terms of @xmath85 ) may be evaluated by the saddle point method . it turns out that for a given @xmath17 the matrix elements have a maximum versus @xmath28 , namely @xmath86 it has been assumed that @xmath87 is of order unity ( i.e. , the expression ( [ e3.2c ] ) is valid near the maximum of the matrix elements in a strip of width @xmath19 ) .",
    "the most important difference between the intermittent and nonintermittent situations is that the maximal matrix elements lie now above the diagonal , and , when increasing the index @xmath17 , their distance from the diagonal increases faster ( linearly ) , than the spread of the significant matrix elements around the maximum ( square root type increase ) . as a consequence , as we shall see , the eigenvectors @xmath88 decay for large @xmath28 exponentially .",

    "explicitely , it gives @xmath187 and the proper asymptotics is given by @xmath188 the accurate eigenvector @xmath59 being the difference of the above two quantities .",
    "here @xmath189 is the solution of the equation @xmath190 these are the first @xmath122 of the set of the eigenvalue equations .",
    "note that if the correction vector @xmath184 is of length @xmath122 ( as is assumed here ) , its last @xmath191 components still enter the next @xmath122 equations as well .",
    "thus , when these components are small ( as required ) , the error caused by them is small and the procedure is consistent .",
    "indeed , for @xmath192 and @xmath193 these components are less than @xmath194 ( cf . table 1 ) .",
    "the phase shift @xmath195 is given by @xmath196 as implied by eqs.([e2.12 ] ) , ( [ e2.13 ] ) .",
    "numerically we get , as table 1 demonstrates , that in case of @xmath73 the phase shift vanishes and @xmath197 .",
    "this result can be understood as follows . for @xmath38 and for @xmath198",
    "the asymptotical solutions @xmath199 can be written approximately as @xmath200 hence the eigenvector @xmath59 is of the form @xmath201 as the matrix elements @xmath21 are of order unity ( compared to @xmath39 ) , if @xmath202 , then @xmath184 will be also of order @xmath44 . for @xmath203",
    "the asymptotical solutions are already accurate to order @xmath44 ( provided that @xmath39 is small enough ) , thus for those values of @xmath17 @xmath184 practically vanishes . in view of eq .",
    "( [ e2.15 ] ) this means that the above estimates for @xmath195 and @xmath184 indeed hold .",
    "note that for @xmath69 the combination @xmath204 enters the eigenvalue equation , hence ( unlike when @xmath205 ) @xmath206 .",
    "another important observation refers to the boundary conditions to eq .",
    "( [ e2.8 ] ) : as we have seen , for @xmath38 we get @xmath207 ( cf .",
