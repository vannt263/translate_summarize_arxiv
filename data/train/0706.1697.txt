    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that a system built up of @xmath2 species of fermi particles , localized on the sites of a bravais lattice and subjected to finite - range interactions , is exactly solvable in any dimension .",
    "exactly solvable means that it is always possible to find a complete set of eigenvalues and eigenoperators of the hamiltonian , which close the hierarchy of the equations of motion .",
    "in such a way , exact expressions for the relevant green s functions and correlation functions can be derived .",
    "these expressions are just formal because they depend on a finite set of parameters to be self - consistently determined . in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been shown how it is possible to fix such parameters exactly by means of algebra constraints in the case of one dimension and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . in this way , complete and exact solutions of these systems have been obtained .",
    "a system of @xmath2 species of fermi particles has been shown @xcite to be isomorphic to a spin-@xmath6 ising - like model in the presence of an external magnetic field , so opening a different route to the study of spin systems , which can be very difficult in two and three dimensions when attached by the transfer matrix method .",
    "furthermore , this approach can shed new light on how to get an exact solution for these systems in higher dimensions in the presence of an external magnetic field as it is always possible @xcite to find an exact expression for the corresponding green s functions and correlation functions .",
    "the exact knowledge of the eigenenergies of the system can give information on the energy scales ruling the physical behavior and the response of the system and can find an application as unbiased check for the approximate studies present in the literature . within our approach",
    "the problem is that correlation and green s functions depend on a finite set of unknown parameters to be self - consistently determined .",
    "a complete exact solution of the system is obtained only when such parameters are known .",
    "these parameters can not be determined by means of the dynamics and are fixed by choosing the representation where the field operators are realized .",
    "in particular [ cfr .",

    "@xcite ] , they can be fixed by appropriate self - consistent equations which are the manifestation of symmetries of the model , algebraic properties of the field operators , boundary conditions ( i.e. properties of the underlying lattice , phase of the system according to the values of the external thermodynamical parameters ) .",
    "it has been shown how to fix exactly such parameters by means of algebra constraints in the one dimensional ( 1d ) case @xcite and we are now working on the possibility to introduce new algebra constraints and topological relations in order to fix the self - consistent parameters in higher dimensions . the first step to realize such an ambitious program appears to be the application of our technique to a bethe lattice of any coordination number @xmath1 . in this article",
    "we apply our formulation , the composite operator method ( com ) @xcite , to the study of a system of @xmath3 species of fermi particles interacting with an intersite coulomb interaction on the bethe lattice with coordination number @xmath1 .",
    "such a model is shown to be isomorphic to the spin-@xmath7 ising model on the bethe lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "bethe @xcite and bethe - like lattices @xcite have been widely studied in solid state and statistical physics because they represent the underlying lattices on which many systems can be exactly solved @xcite . following the line of reasoning that refers to the mean field theory of magnetism ,",
    "the bethe - peierls @xcite approximation was developed in 1935/36 in order to describe crystalline alloys or ising models .",
    "it takes exactly into account the interaction of a given spin with its nearest neighbors but introduces a mean field in order to express the interactions between such neighbors and all the other spins in the lattice .",
    "later , it was pointed out @xcite that such an approximation becomes exact on the bethe lattice .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the partition function of the ferromagnetic spin-@xmath7 ising model on the bethe lattice with any coordination number @xmath1 is equivalent to that in the bethe approximation @xcite .",
    "then , the equivalence of the exact solution of the bethe lattice spin-@xmath7 ising model to the bethe - peierls approximation was shown also in the antiferromagnetic case @xcite .",
    "summarizing , there are two special properties that make bethe lattices particularly suited for theoretical investigations : the self - similar structure which may lead to recursive solutions and the absence of closed loops which restricts interference effects of quantum - mechanical particles in the case of nearest - neighbor coupling .",
    "furthermore , bethe and bethe - like lattices have attracted a lot of interest because they usually reflect essential features of systems even when conventional mean - field theories fail @xcite .",
    "the reason is that such lattices are capable to take into account correlations which are usually lost in conventional mean - field calculations .",
    "the spin-@xmath7 ising model on the bethe lattice can be exactly solved by means of the transfer matrix technique @xcite which reduces the solution to an eigenvalue problem of the second order and all the relevant thermodynamic quantities such as the magnetization and the susceptibility , and so on , can be calculated by means of recursion relations , thanks to the nested structure of the underlying lattice .",
    "the same technique has been recently employed in the exact calculation of the spin - spin correlation functions @xmath8 for any temperatures @xmath9 and external field @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "exact expressions for the free energy and the magnetization of a spin-@xmath7 ising model on a two - layer bethe lattice  in the presence of magnetic fields different in the two layers have been also obtained together with a study of the whole phase diagram by means of an iteration technique @xcite .",
    "also , it should be mentioned a large activity in the framework of the athermal random - field ising model ( rfim ) , where analytical results have been obtained on bethe lattices @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we exactly solve the ferromagnetic spin-@xmath7 ising model on the bethe lattice with any coordination number @xmath1 in the presence of an external magnetic field within the com approach @xcite .",
    "all the green s functions and correlation functions are obtained together with the behavior of the relevant thermodynamic properties .",
    "two - point @xmath11 and three - point @xmath12 spin - spin correlation functions are also provided together with non local correlation functions of higher order .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give the general hamiltonian of the spin-@xmath7 ising model on the bethe lattice and the mapping onto a model of fermi particles with intersite coulomb interactions . in section 3",
    ", we present the general solution in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors . in section 4 ,",
    "we show how to close the system of self - consistent equations and find the unknown parameters in order to compute the correlation and the green s functions . in section 5",
    ", we compute the local correlation functions and in section 6 , the non - local ones . in section 7",
    ", we study all the relevant thermodynamic quantities , such as magnetization , susceptibility , internal energy , specific heat and entropy as functions of the temperature and the external magnetic field , specializing the general formulas to the case of a bethe lattice with coordination number @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks and outlooks of our work are given .",
    "some technical appendices follow .    as a final remark",
    ", we would like to stress that the motivation of this work is to show that the formalism of green s functions and equations of motion is a convenient technique to study spin systems .",
    "most of the techniques used in the literature for the study of these systems are based on the transfer matrix method .",
    "this latter formalism is a very powerful technique and has been largely applied with success to a huge number of models . after the brilliant solution by onsager @xcite for the two - dimensional spin-@xmath7 ising model in zero field , many other two - dimensional ( 2d ) models , such as the dimer problem , six - vertex , eight - vertex ( see baxter s book ) , have been solved by making use of the transfer matrix method [ see baxter s",
    "book @xcite for a comprehensive list of references ] .",
    "however , it should be noticed that this method is very transparent and convenient for the case of one dimension , but becomes complicate for higher dimensions . in spite of the tremendous work done [ among the most recent results , the derivation of the order parameter of the chiral potts model by baxter @xcite has to be mentioned ] ,",
    "many problems remain unsolved .",
    "the exact partition function in a finite magnetic field is still unknown .",
    "no exact results have been obtained for the three - dimensional model . by using the equation of motion formalism",
    ", we have constructed a general method to study ising spin systems @xcite .",
    "such a method is general , in the sense that it has been formulated for any dimension of the system .",
    "we can exactly calculate a complete set of eigenoperators and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , and consequently to derive analytical expressions for the correlation functions . in order that this scheme of calculation could be used in practice",
    ", it is necessary to calculate a set of unknown parameters .",
    "the number of unknown parameters depends not only on the dimensions of the system , but also on the dimension of the spin ; for a ising spin-@xmath15 system on a lattice of coordination number @xmath1 , the number of unknown parameters is @xmath16 [ cfr .",
    "our previous studies @xcite show that it is possible to find the necessary self - consistent equations by using not only properties of the lattice , but also symmetry and algebraic properties of the field operators . in the last two years we have been performing a systematic study of this last point .",
    "we started by considering the simplest problem of spin-@xmath0 on a linear chain @xcite .",
    "then , we considered the case of spin-1 @xcite and spin-@xmath17 @xcite , always for 1d systems .",
    "the extension to spin higher than @xmath0 is not immediate , but requires the introduction of higher composite fields ( projection operators ) .",
    "after this study of 1d systems , we decided to consider more complicate lattices , by considering the bethe lattice .",
    "this lattice has the same topology of 1d because the absence of closed loops , but the analysis requires a dependence on the coordination number . for the bethe lattice we have shown that the problem can be completely solved ; we have shown that all the known results existing in literature can be reproduced .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained new results , not previously obtained , as for the case of three - point correlation functions .",
    "the next step we have in program is the study of the spin-@xmath0 for the 2d lattice .",
    "this step is a very hard task ; the properties of the lattice are different and the introduction of new concepts for writing down the self - consistent equations for the unknown parameters will be necessary .",
    "let us consider the spin-@xmath7 ising model with nearest - neighbor interactions , in presence of an uniform external magnetic field @xmath10 , on a cayley tree with coordination number @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spin operator at the central site @xmath20 . the spin variables @xmath21 take only two values : @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath29 describes the @xmath30-th sub - tree rooted at the site @xmath27 .",
    "the process may be continued until we eventually reach the boundary sites , described by the hamiltonian : @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 $ ] are the boundary points belonging to the @xmath34-th shell . in what follows",
    "we focus only on the sites deep in the interior of the tree , so ignoring the boundary , i. e. we concentrate on the bethe lattice .",
    "let us now consider the transformation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a generic site of the lattice , @xmath37 is the density operator for a spinless fermionic field , @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the annihilation and creation operators satisfying the canonical anti - commutation relations : @xmath40    in this way a mapping is established between the spin-@xmath7 ising model and a model of fermi particles with intersite coulomb interactions on the bethe lattice , where the correspondence between the ising and the fermionic variables is : @xmath41 the ising hamiltonian , eqs .",

    "we ignore the boundary sites and reduce to the bethe lattice .",
    "such an hamiltonian enjoys the particle - hole symmetry , that is , it turns out to be invariant under the transformation @xmath47 , which in the spin language corresponds to the spin - inversion symmetry @xmath48 , @xmath49 ; in particular the chemical potential as a function of @xmath50 scales as @xmath51 this scaling law implies that the magnetization vanishes in zero external magnetic field .",
    "however , as it will be shown in section 7 the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) and/or ( [ 9 ] ) admits also solutions exhibiting a spontaneous breakdown of the particle - hole symmetry ; that is a magnetization different from zero in absence of magnetic field .",
    "we see that the density operator satisfies the equation of motion : @xmath52 = 0 ,   \\label{11}\\ ] ] so that standard methods based on the use of equations of motion and green s function formalism are not immediately applicable in terms of this operator .",

    ", we will show in detail how to deal with such an issue and build up the formalism .",
    "we shall put the attention to the fermionic system and will solve the hamiltonian ( [ 9 ] ) by using the formalism of the equation of motion and green s function method @xcite .",
    "in this section , we exactly solve the hamiltonian ( [ 9 ] ) starting from the identification of a suitable operatorial basis @xcite . in order to pursue this task",
    ", we focus on the central site @xmath25 , even though we could have chosen any other site thanks to the symmetry of the bethe lattice .",
