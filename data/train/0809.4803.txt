    "to illustrate the dynamics with a real - world example , consider two colleagues in science : a phd student and her supervisor .",
    "after years of collaboration , the student s scientific skills and interests have become more and more similar to her supervisor s .",
    "consequently , when graduation day approaches and the student looks for a postdoc position , her choice is inevitably biased by the influences from her supervisor .",
    "so where does she go ? from experience , we know with high probability that she goes to one of her supervisor s scientific friends  friends who themselves have influenced and have been influenced by the supervisor and with whom it will be easy to establish a connection .",
    "that is , when the student navigates her social network for better access to information she is interested in , she uses information that has traveled across the network beyond her nearest neighbors . in this way , whether it is the quest for up - to - date information in science , business , or fashion , the organization , individual preferences , and flow of information make a social system integrated .",
    "+    to capture this dynamic , our model approach is to use agents with one goal : to be updated about topics they find interesting . for simplicity ,",
    "we limit the objects of interest to the agents themselves and exclude extrinsic topics .",
    "agents achieve this goal by communicating with connected friends and establishing new contacts in a changing social network .",
    "to improve their position in the network when making new friends , the agents need a perception of the overall system . by mimicking conversation in everyday life ,",
    "the agents gather information from distant parts of the network and build a simplistic map of the network beyond nearest neighbors .",
    "as the agents build their perception of the system through repeated communication with their friends , they gradually align their interests with agents in their proximity and thereby also align their future social choices .",
    "+ * implementation .",
    "* we incorporate the above elements of human interactions in a simple model with @xmath0 agents that quantifies communication and social navigation through 3 parameters : the communication to social navigation ratio @xmath1 , the interest size @xmath2 , and the flexibility @xmath3 .",
    "central to the model is to build and use a perception of the system .",
    "we therefore give each agent @xmath4 an individual memory @xmath5 .",
    "the memory consists of three one - dimensional arrays , @xmath6 the recollection memory contains @xmath0 names of the friends @xmath7 that provided information about agents @xmath8 . to compare the quality of the information with friends , the quality memory stores the age of each of the @xmath0 pieces of information .",
    "finally , the interest memory contains @xmath9 names of agents in a proportion that reflects the interest in these agents .",
    "recollection and quality memories @xmath10 and @xmath11 constitute agent @xmath4 s local map of the social structure @xcite , and @xmath12 is the interest memory with priorities of other agents ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .    the basic model , accessible as an interactive java applet @xcite , is defined in terms of @xmath0 agents connected by a fixed number of links @xmath13 .",
    "the network model is executed in time steps , each consisting of one of the two events    1 .",

    "[ fig1 ] .    to select a topic of communication or direction of social navigation",
    ", an agent simply picks a random element in her interest memory and reads off the name of the agent that she has stored there .",
    "because the agents also update their interest memories when they communicate , the generated feedback between the organization and the agents interests makes the structure of the interest memory of crucial importance to the outcome of the dynamics .",
    "for example , the degree to which the selection is biased toward recent communication , or local interests , controls the strength of this feedback .",
    "global interests generate a homogeneous organization ; local interests generate a heterogeneous organization . by letting the first @xmath0 elements of the interest memory form the global interest and the remaining @xmath16 elements",
    "form the local interest , the parameter @xmath2 provides full control of the strength of the feedback .",
    "the elements of the static global interests are fixed to each of the @xmath0 agents names , whereas the elements of local interest are updated by communication .",
    "the interest size @xmath2 therefore effectively works as a local to global interest bias .    for @xmath17 , any topic",
    "is selected with equal chance , whereas larger @xmath2 increases the bias of proportionate local interest selection over random global interest selection .",
    "the modeling of proportional allocation of interests is not only the simplest possible mechanism ; it is also in accord with h.  spencer s observation of proportionality between interest and previous experience @xcite . also related to this use of proportionate selection",
    "is the work by h.  simon to explain zipf s law for word usage @xcite , and the work presented in refs .",

    "+ * simulation . *",
    "we initiate each simulation by filling the local interest memory with random names .",
    "later , each turn agent @xmath4 communicates with or about another agent @xmath18 , the name of @xmath18 randomly replaces a fraction @xmath3 of @xmath4 s dynamic interest memory .",
    "that is , @xmath19 for @xmath20 values of @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "thereby old priorities will fade as they are replaced by new topics of interest .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the number of elements of agent @xmath4 s interest memory that are allocated to agent @xmath23 . when selecting a communication topic or the direction of social navigation , agent @xmath4 , by choosing a random element in her interest memory , selects agent @xmath23 proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "we increment the age @xmath25 by one after every @xmath13 communication events .",
    "because every agent always has information with age 0 about itself , @xmath26 , the age of the information about an agent becomes older as , through communication , it percolates away from the agent in the network . assuming that agents are not lying @xcite , the age of the information is therefore a good proxy for how far it has traveled across the network . consequently",
    ", when two agents communicate about a third agent , and evaluate the quality of the information based on its age , the agent with the newest information tends to be closer to the third agent .",
    "this guarantees that the recollection memory works as an efficient local map of the social structure .",
    "social navigation , which corresponds to a rewiring of the network , is a slow process compared to communication .",
    "if this were not the case , random people would share reliable information with anybody and the interactions could more simply be described by a mean - field model .",
    "we therefore simulated the model with on average @xmath27 communications per link for each rewiring event in the system .",
    "because links are formed to friends of friends , the model captures the concept of triadic closure @xcite .",
    "moreover , because friends refer to the particular agents that have provided the most recent information about the selected agent , new links are formed on the basis of the memory rather than on the basis of the present network @xcite .",
    "for example , because the recollection memory can be out - of - date links do not always complete triangles as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and because all agents are represented in every agent s static global interest memory separated clusters can reconnect .",
    "in particular , two friends with large mutual interest in each other that by chance lose their common link tend to reestablish a direct link at some later occasion .",
    "the model of communication and social navigation presented above generates interest groups in modular networks without assuming that people are different from the beginning . the mechanism that drives the process is a feedback between interest formation and the emergence of social structures catalyzed by the flow of information .",

    "[ fig2](a - c ) we show three networks generated by interest sizes @xmath17 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "that is , in the network in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , there is only random global interest selection , whereas the more modular networks in figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](c ) are generated with dominating local proportionate interest selection .",
    "because an agent s interest memory is filled with other agents names proportional to their occurrence in recent local conversations , social navigation will be directed toward these agents .",
    "subsequent reinforcements generate interest groups manifested in the modular networks .",
    "to quantify how modular the networks are , we partition the network into groups so as to minimize a description of the network @xcite .",
    "given this information - theoretic partitioning of the network into modules of sizes @xmath30 , we define the typical module size @xmath31 as the average module size that a randomly selected agent is part of , @xmath32 to only consider true modules , we do not count modules of size 1 with agents without links .",
    "[ fig2](d ) shows the result of increasing local interest memory . after a small increase in the typical module size for small interest memory ,",
    "because fewer agents are disconnected , @xmath31 decreases steadily as agents increasingly focus their attention on other agents in their proximity .",
    "when close - by agents receive more attention , they will also be frequent targets of social navigation .",
    "[ fig2](e ) illustrates , this strongly affects the abundance of triads , here measured in units of the random expectation of triangles @xmath33 @xcite . when agents shift their attention to their neighborhood , the centralized network breaks down .",
    "figure [ fig2](f ) , showing the typical size of the largest hub , @xmath34 , captures this transformation .",
    "overall , for increasing but small interest size @xmath2 , the largest hubs receive more attention , which allows the system to remain in one module .",
    "when @xmath2 exceeds 5 , @xmath31 decreases strongly , the degree distribution narrows further and the number of triangular cliques increases substantially .",
    "the topological measures quantify a transition from a scale - free network at @xmath17 to a modular network at @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , a striking feature is that as @xmath2 increases , there are fewer nodes without links .",
    "presumably , these `` singletons '' more easily integrate into a social context in which they have a history .",
    "the transition from a centralized to a modular structure , driven by the potential to form individual interests , is of course also manifested in the interest memory itself . to quantify this transition",
    ", we counted the typical number of individuals an agent has in her interest memory , @xmath36 , and the overall number of agents that receives attention from other agents , @xmath37 .",
    "the local social horizon , @xmath38 is calculated in a similar fashion as the typical module size .",
    "the denominator , with averages over @xmath18 , corresponds to agent @xmath4 s typical interest allocation in an agent .",
    "the typical number of individuals an agent has in her interest memory is simply the number of such allocations there is room for in an agent s interest memory , averaged over all agents .",
    "because only a limited amount of information is exchanged with agents outside the local social horizon , it can also be thought of as an information horizon @xcite .",
    "the global social horizon , @xmath39 is calculated by pooling the agents interest memories together into @xmath40 for the total number of elements allocated to agent @xmath18 . figure [ fig2](g ) shows the local horizon of the individual agent together with the global horizon of all individuals . as @xmath2 increases , @xmath36 collapses",
    "while @xmath37 remains on the order of @xmath0 ; the development toward social cliques is democratic , with anyone getting a fair share of attention while still allowing people to focus locally on members of their particular `` club . ''    to illustrate the robustness of the model , in figs .",
    "[ fig2](d - g ) we show the results for two interest - adaptation rates @xmath3 , corresponding to two widely different speeds ( stubborn and flexible ) at which old priorities are replaced .",
    "we observe that even a factor 100 change in frequency of priority replacement only has a small effect on the network topologies .",
    "ultimately , at sufficiently high flexibility , such that agents have completely different interests every time they update their social connections , the modular structure breaks down .",
    "* real - world networks . * in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we used a small network with relatively few links to illustrate the effect of interest - memory size on the topology of the network . for larger networks with more links",
    ", the group size will similarly be determined by the interest - memory size rather than the system size . in general , at any reasonably high level of communication to social navigation ratio @xmath1 and low level of flexibility @xmath3 ,",
    "the result is independent of variation in @xmath1 and @xmath3 , and the outcome of the dynamics therefore predominantly determined by the interest size @xmath2 .",
    "that is , for a given set of nodes and links , our model will map each size of interest memory to social networks with a certain degree of modularity , quantified by @xmath31 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly , by fitting the interest size @xmath2 to match the typical module size @xmath31 for real - world networks , the consistency of our model assumptions can be tested directly . to execute this test , we compared the number of triangles and the maximum degree of the simulated networks with the values of the real - world network .",
    "the dynamics were initiated by communication without rewirings to let the agents adapt their memories to the network . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the extrapolated dynamics and in table  1 we report the results for w.  w.  zachary s karate club network @xcite and the dolphin social network reported by d.  lusseau _ et al_.  @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "in table  1 we have also included a very modular network , the largest component of the coauthorship network in network science compiled by m.  newman @xcite , and a non - modular network , the prison network collected by j.  gagnon and analyzed by j.  macrae @xcite",
    ".        the modular structure in the karate club network can be reproduced by @xmath43 , whereas the more integrated social ties of the dolphin social network are reproduced by @xmath44 ( see table  1 and fig .",

    "second , the middle panels of fig .",

    "in general , the more links an agent has , the more attention it receives .",
    "further , the bottom panels show how the network distance between the black and the shaded agents covaries with the information divergence between their interest memories .",
    "the information divergence , also known as the kullback - leibler divergence , corresponds to the number of bits needed to determine the shaded node s interest memory , given information about the black node s interest memory @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the strong correlation between network distance and interest divergence in the bottom panels illustrates the popular saying , `` tell me who your friends are , and i will tell you who you are . ''",
    "we have used communication and social navigation to model the feedback between people s interests and the social structure .",
    "this makes it possible to investigate the interplay between fragmentation and coherence in social systems .",
    "the abstract model of human interactions quantifies communication and social navigation through 3 parameters , the communication to social navigation ratio @xmath1 , the interest size @xmath2 , and the flexibility @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the interest size is the predominant parameter and that agents with an increased possibility to form individual interests ( high @xmath2 ) drive the evolving system to a modular network with a tighter information horizon .",
    "accordingly , the model emphasizes the reinforcement of interest allocation @xcite as the key mechanism for the development of groups .",
    "our idealized model - world starts out with agents with equal properties . in spite of this homogeneity ,",
    "the dynamics generate groups manifested in networks with modular structure and agents with widely different priorities .",
    "repetition of recent communication and reinforced contacts with people one talks about lead to local agreement and global divergence .",
    "central to the model is to build and use the interest memory .",
    "here we have explored a particularly simple linear model for both the construction and the use of priorities , and shown that this is sufficient to generate heterogeneous interests .",
    "however , the model framework can be extended to more detailed networking games , including , for example , trust @xcite , cheating agents @xcite , or update of priorities based on experiences of the reliability of the obtained information .",
    "undoubtedly , real humans will have different intrinsic properties .    here",
    ", without positing that people have different intrinsic properties , we have illustrated how the constraints on the information flow through a system and the potential for individuals to form heterogeneous interests affect the future development of a system . to achieve this , we extrapolated dynamics from the topology of four social networks and found a good agreement between modeled and real - world data .",

    "positive - feedback mechanisms are also inherent in the models of homophily and influence @xcite , in which agents forming groups develop a `` language '' that makes interactions more likely within groups and less likely between groups .",
    "but when those models see the heterogeneity of the population as driving the cultural differentiation , the model presented here instead emphasizes communication barriers in the system as the driving force behind group formation .",
