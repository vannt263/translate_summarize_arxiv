    "the modeling of astrophysical phenomena is often limited by the huge range of spatial and temporal scales that need to be resolved in order to describe accurately the dynamics . in many cases",
    "the large - scale behavior of cosmic bodies depends on interactions at smaller scales that need to be represented properly for a complete understanding of the astrophysical phenomenon in question .",
    "the situation is usually complicated by the requirement of including the back - reaction of the large - scale environment on the smaller scale dynamics in a self - consistent manner .",
    "these types of problems are ubiquitous in astrophysics , but we list here some important examples . the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks may be mediated by the ( magneto-)rotational turbulence that is present in the disk ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this turbulence is itself driven and modulated by the large - scale environment of keplerian rotation and large - scale magnetic fields ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the differential rotation pattern in stars ( including the sun ) arises through an interaction of buoyancy - driven turbulence and rotation , with reynolds stresses at intermediate scales leading to correlations that drive large - scale flows that themselves act back on the turbulence @xcite .",
    "this situation is mirrored in planets , where convective processes may create stresses leading to large - scale flows .",
    "such stresses create turbulence in stably stratified outer weather layers ( for example in jupiter and saturn ) that may drive the formation of jets ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) .",
    "there are a number of approaches to modeling the fluid interactions in astrophysical objects .",
    "the approach taken often depends on whether it is the dynamics or statistics of the system that is of interest .",
    "sometimes information about the dynamics  that is the precise evolution of a particular realisation of a system  is sometimes required for prediction or to compare with observations .",
    "more likely is that the statistics  i.e.  the average properties of an ensemble of evolutions  is of interest ; this may give more insight into the underlying physics of the system .",
    "theoretically and computationally , a natural first approach is to perform direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the fluid ( or mhd ) equations for the system .",
    "this approach is the most straight - forward and has led to breakthroughs in many branches of astrophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "this approach lends itself naturally to determining the dynamics of a given system .",
    "however the extreme nature of the astrophysical turbulent environment ensures that not all spatial scales may be faithfully represented even on the most massive parallel computers available today .",
    "for this reason the practitioners of dns must accept that they are not in the correct parameter regime or may claim that the parameters take into account the effects of scales below the grid cut - off via eddy diffusivities ( sometimes termed turbulent transport coefficients ) .",
    "these diffusivities are usually chosen in a plausible but ad - hoc manner .",
    "moreover , dns may not be an efficient algorithm for determining statistics , since the ensemble over a large number of expensive calculations may be required in order to achieve meaningful statistics",
    ".    an alternative approach , which is not useful for determining dynamics but may be useful for statistics , is to derive evolution equations for the large - scale dynamics and to formulate closure models for net effects of the dynamics at moderate and small scales .",
    "such models have a long history in astrophysics and have also achieved some measure of success ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this approach often utilises ( either implicitly or explicitly ) moment hierarchies ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular",
    "it is customary to relate the average of local interactions of the small scale to the local values of the large - scale fields .",
    "the weakness of such models is that they usually rely on some ad - hoc assumption to close the model  parameterising the interactions between large and small scales  and often make the assumption of homogeneity or isotropy .",
    "they sometimes find it difficult to include self - consistently the effects of the dynamic large - scale environment .",
    "often it is the case in astrophysics that regions of strong transport lie in close proximity to regions of weak or no transport or mixing  for a nice example see the jets in jupiter  and so closures that rely on homogeneity may lead to misleading large - scale dynamics .",
    "moreover it is often the case that the inclusion of such closure models introduces new adjustable parameters to the problem that can be tuned to fit observations and that little is known about the sensitivity of the large - scale dynamics to changes in the parameterizations of the scales not captured .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new approach to the problem of describing astrophysical flows with a range of spatial scales , which we believe will prove useful for a certain class of problems with large - scale inhomogeneous and anisotropic flows .",
    "specifically we describe the development of efficient numerical algorithms to solve truncated hierarchies of cumulant equations , leading directly to the statistical description of astrophysical flows , and we show that this direct statistical simulation ( dss ) is able to reproduce qualitatively statistics obtained by time averaging dns .",
    "that dss has several advantages over dns has long been recognized , going back at least as far as a seminal monograph by @xcite .",
    "low - order statistics are smoother in space and stiffer in time than the underlying detailed flows .",
    "statistically stationary fixed points or slowly varying statistics can therefore be described with fewer degrees of freedom and also can be accessed more rapidly .",
    "convergence with increasing resolution can be demonstrated , obviating the need for separate closure models of the subgrid physics , although these may be included in a natural statistical framework . finally and most importantly , dss leads more directly to insights , by integrating out fast modes , leaving only the slow modes that contain the physical information of most interest @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop the techniques illustrated recently in @xcite , where the prototypical problem of barotropic flow relaxing toward a point jet was considered and the statistics obtained by dns were found to be in good qualitative agreement with those found from a second - order cumulant expansion .",
    "we begin by examining the general case of constructing a cumulant hierarchy for the evolution of a number of dynamic variables .",
    "we describe the derivation and solution of the cumulant equations for the general case , before focussing the discussion on the case of spherical symmetry , where computational efficiencies are available .",
    "having described the method in general , we illustrate the advantages of the method for a simple model of the interaction of turbulence and mean flows that may be relevant to the generation of zonal flows in stable layers in planets and stars .",
    "the model describes the two - dimensional evolution of flows and magnetic fields on a spherical surface .",
    "such an evolution is non - trivial as it is known that for the hydrodynamic problem the reynolds stresses act to drive inhomogeneous zonal flows ; this type of behavior is difficult to parameterize in sub - grid scale closures .",
    "these models and their generalizations have been used to describe the dynamics of the outer layers of giant planets such as jupiter ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) though competing theories for the generation of zonal flows via deep - seated convection ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) are also available .",
    "furthermore there has been much interest in the mhd version of this problem owing to its importance in the dynamics of the solar tachocline ( see e.g. @xcite ) and potentially in the outer layers of extra - solar planets ( @xcite ) . both of these environments are believed to be turbulent , stably stratified and magnetized .    the tachocline is believed to play a crucial role in the generation of the eleven year solar cycle ( see e.g.@xcite ) and angular momentum transport through the tachocline may be responsible for spinning down the solar interior .",
    "one crucial issue to be resolved is therefore the role of turbulence in transporting angular momentum in the tachocline , and this has been addressed both in the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic settings ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "what has been shown is that whereas anisotropic hydrodynamic two - dimensional turbulence leads to the efficient formation of zonal flows via reynolds stresses ; the addition of a magnetic field leads to maxwell stresses that can oppose the formation of jets .",
    "the suppression of jets is a function of the strength of the large - scale magnetic field and the local magnetic reynolds number @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organised in the following manner : in the next section we introduce the general method and the computational savings that can be achieved for the case of spherical symmetry in two dimensions . in section 3 the particular model of mhd turbulence on a rotating spherical surface is introduced and a comparison of the large - scale dynamics of dns and dss is made .",
    "we conclude by discussing extensions to the method and speculating on the range of problems where such a technique may be of use .",
    "in this section we describe the derivation of a general fully spectral algorithm for the direct statistical simulation of astrophysical flows .",
    "we develop the method for the typical case of equations with quadratic nonlinearities , before specialising to systems with spherical symmetry in two dimensions .",
    "consider a system that is represented by partial differential evolution equations ( pdes ) for a number @xmath1 of scalar fields .",
    "typically such a system may be solved directly by discretising the pdes using a finite - difference , finite volume or finite element method or by deriving equations for the amplitude of modes in a spectral expansion .",
    "formally , this transforms the pdes into a finite set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that may be integrated forward in time .",
    "if the discretisation is performed at @xmath2 discrete points ( or for @xmath2 spectral modes ) then the evolution equations can take the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the coefficients . here",
    "the @xmath8 are the discretised values of the dependent variables ( or the amplitudes of the relevant spectral modes ) ; typically these represent a vector of the values of the fluid properties .",
    "we also note here that there is an implicit sum over repeated indices .",
    "hereinafter , to fix ideas , we shall think of the @xmath8 as representing the amplitudes of the spectral modes of a vector of dependent variables  and shall give a concrete example in the next section .",
    "the forcing @xmath9 can then be interpreted as the statistical forcing of the relevant spectral mode .",
    "one way to formulate the cumulant expansion is by carrying out a reynolds decomposition of the dynamical variable @xmath8 into the sum of a mean value and a fluctuation ( or eddy ) : @xmath10 where we defer , for now , choosing the type of averaging denoted by the angular brackets @xmath11 .",
    "typical choices are temporal or zonal averages , are functions of time only , a zonal average may be taken by keeping only those modes that correspond to axisymmetric modes ( for an expansion in spherical basis functions this is equivalent to keeping the @xmath12 modes ) . ] or averages over an ensemble of initial conditions or an ensemble of realisations .    once the reynolds decomposition has been implemented , progress is made by defining the first three equal - time cumulants @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 of the combined scalar fields ( @xmath8 ) as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are respectively the traditional definitions of the first , second and third moments .",
    "we stress here that the second and higher cumulants contain information about correlations that are non - local in space and therefore include interactions that are not included in the simple local moment hierarchies discussed in the introduction . for this reason",
    "this approach is more tailored to inhomogeneous problems .",
    "the hierarchy of equations of motions for the evolution of the cumulants can be obtained directly be differentiating eqs .",

    "we discuss in detail here the case of cumulants in a sphere .      for systems with an underlying spherical symmetry",

    "these symmetries are preserved whether zonal , temporal or ensemble averages are used .",

    "the simplest conceptual choice for the averaging operation @xmath11 is therefore the zonal average and we choose that here , and then follow that with a running time average . on symmetry grounds ,",

    "we now examine the effects of including a toroidal magnetic field and examine the dynamics for two imposed field strengths , @xmath80 . for @xmath128 the onset of jet formation is delayed but in both dns and dss the system eventually settles into a statistically steady state as shown in figure  [ figure4 ] . for both methods , for this",
    "relatively weak imposed mean field , there is eventually little suppression of the jets , with slightly more suppression occurring in the dss . for this choice of parameters ,",
    "the magnetic energy is small compared with the kinetic energy of the flow ( 4% for both dns and dss ( ce2 ) ) , and so it is to be expected that the role of the magnetic field will be secondary .",
    "moreover the magnetic field has been expelled to high latitudes by the strong jets and turbulence at low latitudes ( see figure  [ figure7 ] ) .",
    "this flux expulsion @xcite leads to separated regions with different dynamics ; at low latitudes , where the field is weak , the hydrodynamic evolution continues unimpeded , whilst at high latitudes the magnetic field leads to some suppression of the jets .    at @xmath129 , however , strong qualitative changes are plainly evident as the jets are destroyed by the fluctuations in the magnetic field , both in dns and in dss , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "small remnants of the jets persist in dss at high latitudes , where the imposed toroidal field is weakest ( see fig . [ figure5 ] ) .",
    "dns results ( top panels ) show the incoherent nature of the flows  it is this that leads to the suppression of the jets . for this case , the magnetic energy is in approximate equipartition with the kinetic energy , as shown in table  1 .",
    "once again dns and dss show a remarkable agreement for this case ; see fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "a comparison of the mean toroidal component of the magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] . here",
    "the situation is reversed from the previous weaker field case .",
    "the magnetic field here is too strong to be expelled by the eddies and the jet never forms at low latitudes .",
    "therefore the field is confined to low latitudes and the ( weaker ) jets can only be found at high latitudes where the imposed field is weaker .",
    "for this strength of imposed field the kinetic energy is reduced ( see the values of @xmath118 in table  1 ) and the magnetic energy comes into equipartition with the kinetic energy . clearly",
    "the transport of angular momentum by the reynolds and maxwell stresses and of magnetic flux by the turbulent advection has acted in a very different manner here .",
    "the discussion of these processes and their description via the second cumulants is postponed to a subsequent paper .",
    "we now consider the effect of reducing the minimum stochastic forcing wavevector in the azimuthal direction , @xmath132 , down to wavenumber 1 .",
    "this brings stochastic effects to larger scales and so presents a more robust challenge for dss .",
    "a comparison of the zonal mean relative vorticity and zonal velocity as calculated by dns and dss ( ce2 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] for the hydrodynamic problem .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , there are two prograde jets at high latitudes , and one equatorial retrograde jet ; again the total angular momentum is close to zero .",
    "now , however , the jets are seen to wander significantly in latitude in dns owing to the continual random forcing at large zonal scales . once established in dss , however , they remain fixed in place . as a consequence , the time - averaged zonal means are reduced in magnitude in dns compared with dss , as made apparent in the quantitative plot of fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] .",
    "imposing a relatively weak toroidal field by setting @xmath128 again has little effect on the zonal mean velocity as shown in figure  [ figure9 ] .",
    "however at @xmath133 the jets are largely eliminated by the fluctuations in the magnetic field , both in dns and in dss .",
    "somewhat larger jet remnants remain at high latitudes , where the imposed toroidal field is weakest , and again stronger jets are found in dss than in dns ( see fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] ) .",
    "the toroidal field is tightly confined to latitudes less than roughly @xmath134 , as fig . [ figure11 ] depicts , likely owing to flux expulsion of the field .",
    "again dss does a reasonably good job of reproducing the mean field .",
    "in this paper we have introduced the concept of direct statistical simulation ( dss ) for astrophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "we have compared the results of direct numerical simulation ( dns ) and dss for the problem of two - dimensional hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics on a spherical surface .",
    "although the set - up of the model is relatively simple , the ensuing dynamics is not . in the hydrodynamic case ,",
    "non - trivial interactions at moderate scales drive inhomogeneous large - scale zonal flows ( jets / winds ) . with a weak imposed field",
    "the jets remain largely unaffected and the magnetic fields are expelled to higher latitudes . with a stronger imposed toroidal magnetic field",
    "these winds are suppressed except at high latitudes where the imposed field is weak .",
    "we find that even the simplest formalism of dss , based upon the truncation of the cumulant hierarchy at second order , is capable of reproducing the driving and suppression of the zonal flows and the flux expulsion of the magnetic fields by the inhomogeneous jets .",
    "because the method includes interactions that are non - local in space it is very well suited to such inhomogeneous problems thatypically arise in astrophysics .",
    "such a truncation is equivalent to keeping the mean / eddy interactions in the eddy equations and the eddy / eddy interactions in the mean equations , whilst suppressing the eddy / eddy interactions in the eddy equations .",
    "thus it is the reynolds and maxwell stresses that respectively drive and suppress the jet , not an inverse cascade as is frequently assumed .    the dss scheme is more numerically efficient than the corresponding dns .",
    "we believe that the results presented here are an encouraging beginning for the concept of dss in astrophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "it is important though to determine the range of validity of such a procedure .",
    "clearly the method is designed to work best when the dynamics leads to the generation of substantial statistical means ( e.g. mean flows or magnetic fields ) or involves the interactions of prescribed ( usually inhomogeneous ) mean quantities with smaller scale turbulence .",
    "the method is inefficient when the turbulence is dominated completely by small - scales and is largely homogeneous  for example homogeneous , isotropic hydrodynamic turbulence , or the small - scale dynamo problems ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we do believe , however , that many cases of astrophysical interest _ do _ fall into the category where dss techniques may prove useful .",
    "examples currently under consideration include the interaction of mean magnetic fields and shear flows either on a spherical surface ( leading to joint instability ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ) or in a cylindrical domain ( leading to magnetorotational instability ) , the instability and mixing of large - scale shear flows in the presence of a magnetic field , and the driving of zonal flows via convection in a tilted cylindrical annulus ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * )",
    ". it will be interesting to determine how well the techniques described in this paper fare for these problems , and we predict varying degrees of success .",
    "we also stress that even utilising dss will not allow the calculation of statistics at astrophysically realistic values .",
    "however it is to be hoped that , whereas the dynamics may be extremely sensitive to the parameters , for a range of problems the statistics may prove less so .",
    "we believe that some of these problems may require the inclusion of higher order cumulants in the scheme and are currently engaged in determining efficient numerical procedures for their integration .    clearly in the longer term , if these techniques prove useful for the simpler problems described above , it will be of interest to apply them to more computationally intensive problems in astrophysical fluids . these include the driving of zonal flows in planets , the mixing of angular momentum and abundances in stellar interiors and the transport by turbulence in accretion disks .    ) that develops a westerly ( prograde ) jet along the equator .",
