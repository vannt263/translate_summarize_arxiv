    ", the _ powerful image _ of an accessible functor @xmath8 is the smallest full subcategory of @xmath9 which contains the image of @xmath0 and is closed under subobjects ( see @xcite*5.5 ) . as shown in @xcite , this theorem implies boney s theorem ( see @xcite ) asserting that , assuming the existence of arbitrarily large strongly compact cardinals , every abstract elementary class ( aec ) is tame .",
    "a consequence of the latter theorem is that , assuming the existence of arbitrarily large strongly compact cardinals , shelah s categoricity conjecture in a successor cardinal is true for abstract elementary classes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this note is twofold ",
    "firstly we weaken the set theoretic assumption to the existence of arbitrarily large cardinals @xmath10 admitting an @xmath11-compact cardinal ( see definition  [ mustrcpct ] ) .",
    "this thus weakens the set - theoretic assumption known to be sufficient to prove boney s theorem and consequently , when paired with a result of boney and unger from a forthcoming paper ( see the remarks following corollary  [ allaectame ] ) , shelah s categoricity conjecture in successor cardinals for abstract elementary classes .",
    "the second contribution is that , instead of the powerful image , we can use the @xmath10-pure powerful image , that is , the closure of the image under @xmath10-pure subobjects .",
    "the notion of purity originally arose from model theory , where it remains an important concept ( see for example @xcite for purity in the model theory of modules ) , but has also developed to be a central notion in the general theory of accessible categories ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we present two different ways of employing our large cardinal assumption to obtain our result .",
    "one follows @xcite directly and the other uses elementary embeddings of models of set theory ( see @xcite ) . the first step in each case is to reduce to the case of a suitable reduct functor @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a theory in infinitary logic with signature @xmath14 .",
    "it is interesting to note that already in 1990 shelah and makkai @xcite had obtained a categoricity transfer theorem from a successor for @xmath15 theories , where @xmath16 is a strongly compact cardinal ; our approach in some sense brings the general context of aecs back to this infinitary logic setting .",
    "will boney and spencer unger have independently obtained similar results about tameness of aecs from similarly reduced large cardinal assumptions , and moreover can derive large cardinal strength back from tameness assumptions . specifically ,",
    "they show in a forthcoming paper @xcite the equivalence of `` every aec @xmath17 with ls@xmath18 is @xmath19 tame '' with @xmath16 being _ almost strongly compact _ , that is , @xmath1-compact for every @xmath20 .",

    "further , @xmath190 holds in @xmath170 if and only if there is some @xmath196 such that @xmath197 satisfies @xmath190 : for @xmath190 to be true in @xmath170 , the existential quantification in @xmath190 must be witnessed by particular elements of @xmath170 , and there will be some @xmath198 large enough that that the corresponding constants @xmath175 are assigned coherently in @xmath197 and witness that @xmath190 holds in @xmath197 .",
    "we thus have that if @xmath190 is true in @xmath170 then it is true in every member of @xmath199 for such @xmath198 , and if @xmath190 is false in @xmath170 it is false in every member of @xmath200 .",
    "since these sets are in the ultrafilter @xmath184 , we have from o s theorem for @xmath201 that @xmath185 is a model of @xmath190 if and only if @xmath170 is , and may conclude that it is indeed a model of @xmath181 . + * step 3 version ( ii ) : using an elementary embedding .",
    "* this second approach is via theorem  [ embedcmpct ] .",
    "let @xmath202 , and let @xmath78 be an elementary embedding as in theorem  [ embedcmpct ] for our @xmath16 , @xmath72 and @xmath203 .",
    "note that because @xmath80 is closed under @xmath204-tuples , @xmath80 correctly computes whether an object is in @xmath205 : being a model for the theory @xmath13 is @xmath206-definable from the `` set of all @xmath207-tuples '' function @xmath208 , and hence is absolute between models of set theory that agree on @xmath208 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "it therefore has an upper bound @xmath216 in @xmath211 , which in particular is an upper bound for @xmath213 .    for every object @xmath191 of @xmath57 ,",
    "the function @xmath217 is a @xmath47-homomorphism , by elementarity of @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , for every morphism @xmath218 of @xmath57 , we have a commuting square @xmath219^{d(f)}\\ar[d]_{j{\\upharpoonright}d(i)}&d(i')\\ar[d]^{j{\\upharpoonright}d(i')}\\\\ j(d(i))\\ar[r]_{j(d(f))}&j(d(i ' ) ) } \\ ] ] as one can check by chasing around an element @xmath220 : @xmath221 , again by elementarity .",
    "composing these maps with the maps @xmath222 , we have a cocone @xmath223 in @xmath224 ( in @xmath79 ) from @xmath189 to @xmath225 , and hence there is a unique homomorphism @xmath226 such that @xmath227 .",
    "moreover by uniqueness we have that @xmath228 must equal @xmath229 , as @xmath230 for every object @xmath191 of @xmath57 by elementarity .",

    "* theorem  1 and remark  1(2 ) ) .",
    "_    \\(2 ) since a @xmath232-pure morphism is @xmath10-pure for @xmath233 , we have @xmath234 for @xmath233 .",

    "this functor is accessible and its full image consists of split monomorphisms in @xmath238 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example  3.5(1 ) ) ) .",
    "it is easy to see that this full image is closed under split subobjects .",
    "in fact , consider a split monomorphism @xmath245 where @xmath246 .",
    "this means that there is @xmath247 such that @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "thus @xmath250 .",
    "but the closure of split monomorphisms under @xmath10-directed colimits precisely consists of @xmath10-pure monomorphisms ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  2.30 ) ) .",
    "it is easy to see that , for each regular cardinal @xmath10 , there is a @xmath10-pure monomorphism which does not split .",
    "thus the full image of @xmath0 is closed under split subobjects but is not accessibly embedded into @xmath238 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a regular cardinal and @xmath25 an accessible category such that there exists an @xmath99-compact cardinal .",
    "then the powerful image of any @xmath10-accessible functor to @xmath25 preserving @xmath100-presentable objects is accessible and accessibly embedded in @xmath25 .",
    "we proceed as in the proof of [ th2.2 ] , taking the category @xmath251 of @xmath9-objects and monomorphisms instead of @xmath112 .",
    "this category is closed in @xmath9 under @xmath10-directed colimits .",
    "since any object of @xmath9 is a @xmath100-directed colimit of @xmath10-pure subobjects @xmath100-presentable in @xmath9 , it is certainly a @xmath100-directed colimit of subobjects @xmath100-presentable in @xmath9 , and so @xmath251 is @xmath100-accessible .",
    "the functor @xmath252 preserves monomorphisms , and monomorphisms in @xmath46 are injective homomorphisms .",
    "hence , in the ultraproduct approach to step 3 of the proof of [ th2.2 ] , we may replace @xmath172 by the atomic diagram of @xmath170 consisting of atomic and negated atomic formulas to obtain the desired result ; in the embeddings approach , we simply use that a right factor of a monomorphism must also be a monomorphism .      as noted for theorem  [ th2.2 ] ( with reference to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* uniformization theorem  2.19 and remark  2.20 ) ) , @xmath3 and @xmath101 as in the statement of theorem  [ th2.7 ] may be found for any accessible functor .",
    "grossberg and vandieren @xcite showed that assuming amalgamation , joint embedding and no maximal models , tameness implies the shelah categoricity conjecture in successor cardinals for aecs .",
    "this conjecture was a significant test question for the appropriateness of aecs as a framework for generalising first order model theory , and indeed the conjecture for arbitrary cardinals remains an important open question .",
    "result @xcite , that if there is a proper class of strongly compact cardinals then every aec is tame , was thus a significant breakthrough ; corollary  [ allaectame ] improves upon this important result by reducing the large cardinal assumption used to prove it .",

    "thus , with proposition  [ almstrcpct ] one has an equivalence between this large cardinal property , tameness of all aecs , and the accessibility of powerful images of accessible functors .",
    "furthermore , boney and unger have shown that the extra conditions of amalgamation , joint embedding and no maximal models follow from this large cardinal axiom , so one indeed has from this assumption the shelah categoricity conjecture in successor cardinals for aecs ."
