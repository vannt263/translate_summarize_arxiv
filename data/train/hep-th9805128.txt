    "a few years ago , it was proposed a maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) gauge theory with an additional magnetic moment interaction@xcite for which bogomolnyi - type self - dual equations can be derived and vortex - like configurations appear whenever suitable relationships among the parameters of the model are obeyed @xcite .",
    "an important issue that comes about is the claim of a relation between the property of self - duality and the @xmath0 supersymmetric extension of the model , accomplished by means of a relationship between the central charge of the extended model and the existence of topological quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "although a fundamental reason for this connection has not been given so far in the literature , in certain cases it appears to be unavoidable to construct the @xmath0 supersymmetric extension of a given bosonic model in order to obtain the proper higgs potential and self - dual conditions compatible with the euler - lagrange equations .    in this regard ,",
    "we have succeeded in deriving an @xmath0 maxwell - chern - simons model with anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "our strategy consisted in the formulation of an @xmath1 @xmath2 gauge model with a bf - term , free of constraints on the coupling constants dimensions .",
    "similar constraints have also been needed in order to find an @xmath0 susy extension of the maxwell higgs model @xcite and of the chern - simons higgs model @xcite . ] . upon a convenient dimensional reduction of the component - field action from ( 1 + 3 ) to ( 1 + 2 ) dimensions",
    ", we set out an @xmath0 @xmath3 maxwell - higgs model with a chern - simons term and magnetic moment interaction with the matter sector . adopting this viewpoint",
    ", we raised the possibility of freely handling the parameters of the model and , remarkably , it enabled us to obtain topological self - dual solutions , even in the critical regime mentioned above .",
    "this is to be compared with previous attempts where just a @xmath4 higgs potential has been considered so as to find self - dual solutions @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we derive the proper self - dual equations and the higgs potential needed to allow topological as well as non - topological vortices in a non - minimally coupled mcs model ; this is our main result .",
    "we perform a gauge - independent calculation which permits a suitable handling of the energy functional , leading to self - dual solutions to the equations of motion in both the symmetric and asymmetric phases of the model ( sections 2 and 3 ) . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the properties of system for the critical value of the magnetic coupling .",
    "the analysis of the self - dual solutions and a wide variety of soliton configurations are presented in section 5 . finally , in section 6",
    ", we draw our conclusions .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have put forward the @xmath0 susy lagrangian including the bosonic model we are going to analyse here . in component - field form",
    ", it exhibits the proper non - minimally coupled mcs extension needed for our main purpose of finding a topological phase in the bosonic theory . for the sake of a better understanding",
    "let us quote below the full expression of the @xmath0 susy lagrangian in terms of components    @xmath5\\right . \\right\\ }   \\label{full3d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 the origin of all the fields appearing in equation eq.([full3d ] ) has been carefully justified in @xcite ; we refer the reader to this reference for the details . here , we are basically concerned with the bosonic sector of the theory , so we will focus our attention to a particular piece as we discuss in what follows .",
    "let us consider the purely bosonic part of the susy lagrangian of eq.([full3d ] ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponds to the fayet - iliopoulos term included in the susy lagrangian in order to allow spontaneous breaking of gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for the auxiliary @xmath9field gives @xmath10 where for convenience we have written @xmath11 substitution of the above in eq.([lag ] ) , gives the following higgs - type potential @xmath12 which depends on two fields : a real ( @xmath13 ) and a complex ( @xmath14 ) scalar . upon elimination of the auxiliary field @xmath9",
    ", we will work with the following lagrangian    @xmath15    which shall play a central role in the present discussion .",
    "let us first define the currents @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a complex scalar parametrized in terms of @xmath13 and @xmath14 as given below @xmath18    as we shall discuss in the next section , the scalar @xmath17 will be identified as the physical field in terms of which the vortices will be specified .",
    "now , the equation of motion for the gauge field can be written as @xmath19 where the time component determines the modified `` gauss law '' @xmath20    the gauge invariant modes are now short - range due to the mass term resulting from eq.([gauss ] ) .",
    "hence , the first term has a vanishing space integral . on the other hand , the third term results in a line integral taken at infinity which also vanishes for finite energy configurations .",
    "therefore , it can be seen from the remaining piece that the charge of the vortex solutions is related to non - zero magnetic fluxes by @xmath21 where @xmath22",
    "the energy functional is given by @xmath23 which can be reorganized as @xmath24derivative , though not explicitly written in the above equation , has an effect which is implicit through @xmath25 .",
    "the terms linear in @xmath26 are not present in the energy because they are metric - independent .",
    "now , the search of the bogomolnyi bound for the energy yields the proper self - dual equations in a natural way @xmath27 using the following identities @xmath28 integrating by parts and dropping surface terms , one finally gets @xmath29 the last two terms vanish whenever integrated over the whole space ; so , using the gauss law and considering static configurations , the lower bound to the energy is clearly attained .    to close this section ,",
    "let us express the self - dual equations and the higgs potential in terms of the @xmath17field ; in so doing , we shall get expressions that are more useful for our future purposes .",
    "now , eqs .",
    "( [ dual ] ) and ( [ higgs1 ] ) read @xmath30 and @xmath31 which , for @xmath32 , gives the higgs potential of the minimal mcs model as given by the supersymmetric lagrangian found in ref.@xcite , as expected .",
    "notice that the system has two degenerate minima , a symmetric phase for which @xmath33 @xmath34 and an asymmetric phase where @xmath35 @xmath36",
    "let us now analyze a very special value of the magnetic coupling , namely , @xmath37 for which the equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) reduce down to first order , looking similar to the pure cs model s .",
    "this choice yields fractional statistics describing anyons @xcite .",
    "remarkably enough , this is the value that has to be fixed in order to obtain an @xmath0 mcs non - minimal theory , when working from the outset in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that by performing the susy extension without dimensional reduction , only a symmetric , @xmath4 , higgs potential has been found , yielding , consequently , just non - topological solutions @xcite .",
    "hence , for @xmath38 one has @xmath39 whose time - component reads @xmath40    we will now show that , in our model , we can make such a special choice , @xmath38 , without constraining the potential to a symmetric phase",
    ". we shall also find topological vortices , in contrast to previous attempts ( we drop the subscript @xmath41 in what follows ) .    using @xmath42 [ see eq.([dual2 ] ) ] and defining @xmath43 by means of @xmath44 @xmath45 to have positive definite energy configurations ) we get    @xmath46    on the other hand , self - duality relations provide also @xmath47 thus , for @xmath48 defined as the maximum value of @xmath49 , eqs .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) give    @xmath50    notice that the @xmath13 field has decoupled from the other components , i.e. , it can be written in terms of just the higgs field @xmath17 .",
    "another interesting feature of the bosonic model just found is that it still presents together both topological and non - topological phases @xmath51 note that for @xmath52 @xmath53 it behaves like the higgs potential typical of a pure cs model @xcite , as expected .",

    "( [ dual2 ] ) can be written as @xmath62 where we have used ( [ bm ] ) and redefined @xmath63    the natural boundary conditions at infinity result from the requirement of finite energy , while a non - singular behavior determines the values at the origin .    in",
    "the _ topological _ phase , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for nontrivial vorticity @xmath58 .",
    "then , for large @xmath57 the asymptotic form of the topological vortices is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant whose value is determined by the form of the solutions at the origin . also at the origin , one must expect non - singular fields , implying @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "hence , the magnetic flux is quantized as follows @xmath60 = \\frac{2\\pi } en.\\ ] ]    now , we can combine eqs .",
    "( [ dual_ar1],[dual_ar2 ] ) to produce a second order equation @xmath70 so that the behavior of the solutions for small values of @xmath57 , where @xmath71 , can be approximated by a liouville - type function @xmath72 ^{-1 }   \\label{liousol}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are arbitrary constants . upon substitution of the above expression in eq.([dual_ar1 ] ) , we find @xmath75 so that using @xmath69 we obtain @xmath76 .",
    "it implies that , near the origin , the form of the vortex is power - like @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "this last relation is obtained by expanding eq.([liousol ] ) around @xmath79 ; however , the precise numerical values of the @xmath80 constants are determined by the shape of the fields at infinity , rather than by their behavior at the origin .",
    "indeed , we have numerically solved the self - dual equations of motion by means of an iterative procedure , giving a tentative value for @xmath80 which is corrected each time by imposing that both limits , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , hold together at infinity . for illustration , we quote some of the results in fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 , for the cases @xmath83 notice the ring - type structure of the topological vortices ( see .",
    "fig . 2 and fig .",
    "this profile is analogous to the pure cs magnetic field shape @xcite .",
    "the @xmath84 configurations are related to the @xmath85 ones by the transformation @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "several values of @xmath80 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "0.2 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.3 cm    as we show in table 2 , the asymptotic values of the gauge field remain constrained , increasingly close to @xmath90 while the magnetic flux approaches the limit @xmath91 as @xmath58 grows .    in fig .",
    "9 , we show the ring structure of the non - topological vortices , with the maximum of the magnetic field out of the origin as it happens in the topological phase of the model .",
    "notice that for @xmath92 the radius of the vortices , together with their distance to the origin , are minimal for a given charge @xmath58 , while the higgs field presents a cuspidal profile attaining its maximum value , @xmath93 .",
    "in this work , we have obtained the self - dual soliton solutions of a maxwell  chern - simons model with anomalous coupling , in both topological and non - topological sectors . to do this",
    ", we have focused the bosonic part of a @xmath0 @xmath3 supersymmetric model obtained by dimensional reduction from a @xmath1 @xmath2 theory which enabled us finding a topological phase in @xmath3 . as long as we know",
    ", it is the first time that topological self - dual vortices are found in a non - minimal mcs system .",
    "we have also analyzed the non - topological phase in detail for several values of the parameters and magnetic fluxes .",
    "it is worth noting that in contrast to previous reports @xcite the non - topological phase of our model is not given by a simple @xmath94 higgs potential but rather as a fourth order function @xmath95 .",
    "our non - topological solutions are then different from those presented in @xcite although similar in shape .    in order to compare our results with the literature at hand we have especially considered the critical anomalous coupling .",
    "remarkably , we have shown that in this case it is possible to obtain a topological phase in the non - minimal maxwell  chern - simons model in contrast with foregoing publications .",
    "we have also found that the corresponding non - topological phase is not the one analyzed in previous attempts .",
    "a natural extension of this work would be relaxing the anomalous coupling so as to consider non - critical values of @xmath96 . in principle , such a general situation could also present topological solitons . since analytical as well as computational analyses are",
    "more involved in that case , it is still under investigation and the results shall be soon reported elsewhere .",
