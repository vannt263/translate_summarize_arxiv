    "despite accounting for only a small fraction of all the baryons in the universe ( see , e.g. , petitjean et al .",

    "however , zwaan & prochaska ( 2006 ) used co emission maps in the nearby universe to show that the h@xmath0 column density distribution function is a continuous extension of the hi distribution for high column densities .",

    "overall , the measured extinction - to - dust ratio , a@xmath43(hi )  @xmath44  mag@xmath45 ( 2@xmath46 ) is typical of that of the general dla population ( vladilo et al .",
    "this , together with the presence of h@xmath0 in a component with higher depletion factor suggests that appreciable fraction of hi may be associated with components that do not have h@xmath0 .",
    "molecular hydrogen is detected in two distinct sub - systems at @xmath47  =  3.28667 and 3.28742 , separated by @xmath2552  km  s@xmath11 with absorption lines from rotational levels up to j  =  3 ( see figure  [ ajuste_h2 ] ) .",
    "the results of the fits to the numerous absorption lines are given in table  [ molecular ] .",
    "the @xmath47  =  3.28742 component alone contains about 90% of the total h@xmath0 column density in the absorber , log  @xmath13(h@xmath0 )  =  18.62 , and coincides with the ci component .",
    "this is expected because the energy of the photons that ionize ci is close to that of photons that dissociate h@xmath0 .",
    "the total h@xmath0 column density integrated over the two components and all rotational levels is log  @xmath13(h@xmath0 )  =  18.66  @xmath4  0.27  ( @xmath3 ) corresponding to a molecular fraction of log  @xmath14  =  log  2@xmath48 @xmath13(h@xmath0)/(2@xmath48 @xmath13(h@xmath0 )  +  @xmath13(hi ) )  =  @xmath49 if we assume that the totality of neutral hydrogen is associated with the h@xmath0 components .",
    "this value is amongst the lowest observed in h@xmath0 bearing dlas with metallicities [ zn / h ]  @xmath24  @xmath50 ( petitjean et al .",
    "2006 , noterdaeme et al .",

    "2010 , srianand et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "from the detection of h@xmath0 in different rotational levels ( j=0 to j=3 , see table  [ molecular ] ) , it is possible to put constraints on the physical state of the gas .",
    "the excitation temperature @xmath51 between rotational levels 0 and j is defined as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the statistical weight of the rotational level j : @xmath54 with nuclear spin i  =  0 for even j ( para - h@xmath0 ) and i  =  1 for odd j ( ortho - h@xmath0 ) , @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath56 is the energy difference between level j and the ground state ( j=0 ) . if the excitation processes are dominated by collisions , then the populations of the rotational levels follow a boltzmann distribution described by a unique excitation temperature for all rotational levels .",
    "this is generally the case for low rotational levels which have a de - excitation time scale larger than the collision time - scale .",
    "indeed , @xmath57 is a good indicator of the kinetic temperature ( roy et al . 2006 ; le petit et al .",
    "2006 ) especially in clouds similar to the one we study here ( log  @xmath13(h@xmath0 )  @xmath24  18 ) .",
    "however , because of the small energy difference between the j=0 and j=1 levels , the value of @xmath57 is very sensitive to uncertainties on @xmath13(h@xmath0,j=0 ) and @xmath13(h@xmath0,j=1 ) and the use of higher rotational levels may help derive a better constraint on @xmath58 . from fig .",
    "[ excitation_h2 ] , it can be seen that the population of j=0 to j=2 levels can be described by a unique excitation temperature @xmath59  k and @xmath60  k for the first and second component , respectively .",
    "these temperatures are slightly smaller than what was found in previous studies of h@xmath0-bearing dlas ( e.g. ledoux et al .",
    "2003 , @xmath61 90 to 180  k ; srianand et al .",
    "2005 , @xmath61  153@xmath478  k ) , but similar to what is measured in the ism of our galaxy ( 77@xmath417  k ; rachford et al .",
    "2002 ) and in the magellanic clouds ( 82@xmath421  k ; tumlinson et al .",
    "2002 ) , where hi column densities are also large .",
    "note that , temperatures observed through high latitude galactic sight lines are also larger ( 124@xmath48  k ; gillmon et al .",
    "2006 , or ranging from 81  k at log  @xmath13(h@xmath0 )  =  20 to 219  k at log  @xmath13(h@xmath0 )  =  14 ; wakker 2006 ) .",
    "the population of j=3 rotational level is in turn enhanced compared to the boltzmann distribution , which indicates the presence of additional excitation processes such as uv pumping ( e.g. noterdaeme et al .",
    "2007a ) and/or turbulent dissipation ( as possibly indicated by the larger @xmath62-parameters for higher - j levels seen by noterdaeme et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "absorption lines produced by neutral carbon are seen only in one component at @xmath47  =  3.28746 ( see figure  [ ajuste ] ) and are associated with the strongest h@xmath0 component .",
    "we used the relative populations of the two first sub - levels of the ci ground state to derive the excitation temperature of the ci fine - structure level , according to the boltzmann equation ( see eq .  1 ) .",
    "we have adopted the energy difference between the ci excited ( ci@xmath7 : 2s@xmath632p@xmath63@xmath64p1 ) and true ground - state ( 2s@xmath632p@xmath63@xmath64p0 ) levels , @xmath65  =  23.6  k. the population ratio @xmath13(j=1)/@xmath13(j=0 ) of the ci fine - structure level corresponds to an excitation temperature of @xmath66 = 15.4@xmath40.1 k. this is higher than the temperature expected in the case the excitation is dominated by the cosmic microwave background radiation ( @xmath67  =  11.7  k at @xmath68 ) indicating that excitation by collisions is important . using the results shown in fig .  12 of srianand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we derive that the particle density , @xmath20 , is in the range 50 - 80  @xmath22 .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of a qso - dla system with an extremely large column density , @xmath69hi@xmath70 , at @xmath28 towards the quasar sdss j081634@xmath6144612 .",
    "the velocity structure of associated metal absorption lines indicates the presence of 8 components grouped into three sub - systems centered at @xmath71 , 3.28735 and 3.28814 respectively , spanning @xmath72 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "ci is detected in the @xmath73 sub - system whilst h@xmath0 is detected in both the @xmath71 and 3.28735 sub - systems . from the h@xmath0 excitation",
    ", we derive a kinetic temperature of @xmath74 k and the observed column density ratio @xmath75ci@xmath76ci@xmath77 yields a particle density in the range @xmath78  @xmath22 . the depletion of metals onto dust grains measured in the strongest h@xmath0 component located at @xmath79 is similar to what is observed in the disc of the galaxy .",
    "all this shows that this system , apart from having unusually large n(hi ) , has properties consistent with that of a typical h@xmath0-bearing dla ( see ledoux et al . 2003 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "while log  @xmath75hi@xmath80 dlas are very rarely seen in front of qsos , several have already been detected in the optical afterglow spectrum and at the redshift of long - duration @xmath23-ray bursts .",
    "two of them ( towards grb050401 , grb080607 and grb060926 ) even have log  @xmath75hi@xmath81 ( watson et al .",
    "2006 ; prochaska et al . 2009 ; jakobsson et al .",
    "it is not surprising to observe a strong dla at the redshift of grbs since these objects are expected to be associated with star - forming regions where the gas is likely to be found in large quantities .",
    "although qso - dlas are located close to regions where stars form as indicated by the presence of metals , the detection of cii@xmath7 absorption and galaxy - like kinematics ( wolfe et al .",
    "2003 ) , their exact nature is not completely elucidated .",
    "some should be associated with the ism of galaxies especially when molecules are detected ( noterdaeme et al .",

    "this may be a consequence of small number statistics however ( see fynbo et al .",
    "2006 and prochaska et al . 2009 ) and possibly of inadequate data as high spectral resolution in the blue is usually needed ( see ledoux et al . 2009 ) .    if these differences exist when comparing the overall populations , they may not be that apparent if we restrict ourselves to high hi column density systems .",

    "this is well known for qso - dlas and could be a consequence of these dlas being missed because of the high induced attenuation which makes the qso drop out of the sample ( e.g. boiss et al . 1998 ) .",
    "altough grb afterglows are for a little while much brighter than quasars , the presence of a dust - bias could also affect their statistics ( see e.g. fynbo et al .",
    "2009 ; ledoux et al .",
    "2009 ; and greiner et al .",
    "a possibility is that grb - dla metallicities could be higher than measured as often only lower limits are derived from intermediate resolution observations ( see prochaska 2006 , petitjean & vergani , 2011 ) .",
    "this can however probably not explain this lack of systems completely .",
    "sdss j081634@xmath6144612 is located at the limit of the region where systems are missing and within the region where grb - dlas are located . in fig .",

    "it can be seen here again that the dla towards sdss j081634@xmath6144612 is well within the region where grb - dlas are located .",
    "therefore , our study indicates that extremely large hi column density dlas found toward qsos have properties similar to those of grb - dlas .",
    "following schaye ( 2001 ) , krumholz et al ( 2009 ) proposed a radiation - insensitive model hence applying to both qso and grb - dlas where the lack of high-@xmath13(hi ) , high - metallicity is explained by the conversion from atomic to molecular gas . here ,",
    "the physical conditions in the @xmath86-bearing cloud indicate that we are still observing diffuse gas .",
    "this is not in tension with the above model since dense , cold and molecular gas is expected to have a small cross section and is not easily intercepted by the line - of - sight .",
    "interestingly , a fully molecular cloud has been observed in the case of the @xmath2(hi )  =  22.7 dla associated to grb080607 ( prochaska et al .",
    "2009 ) , which could be observed very quickly ( @xmath871h ) after the burst . therefore , while the absorption properties of high-@xmath13(hi ) grb and qso - dlas appear to be similar , detecting fully molecular clouds will remain challenging in the case of qsos , because of the random distribution of the lines - of - sight and the high induced extinction .",
    "very little is known about grb host galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath84 , savaglio et al .",

    "2010 ; see however barnes & haehnelt 2010 ) . but what is true for the overall qso - dla population does not hold for its high column density end . we have shown here that dlas with the highest hi column densities , seem to have absorption properties similar to that of grb - dlas",
    ". it would be most interesting to search for emission lines associated to these dlas which have probably small impact parameters ( see e.g. noterdaeme et al .",

    "kukarni et al . (",
    "2012 ) demonstrated that detecting the lyman-@xmath1 emission is even possible from uves data . here",
    ", the dla is covered at the edge of two uves echelle orders and possibly contaminated by scattered light in the red arm , preventing us from putting any meaningful limit on the ly-@xmath1 flux within the slit .",
    "follow - up observations specifically tuned to the search of emission lines is thus desirable ( see e.g. fynbo et al . 2010 , 2011 , proux et al . 2012 ) . ]",
    "note that the above conclusion is probably not very surprising as high hi column densities likely arise in gas located in the inner regions of star forming galaxies of moderate attenuation .",
    "this idea should be investigated with larger samples of both qso and grb - dlas with high column densities .",
