    "the answer turns out to be closely connected with the behaviour of the projection of the measure @xmath13 into the line @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath14 . under a mild geometric condition on the set @xmath2  implied by the strong separation condition ",

    "but in most practical instances  especially when @xmath18  current methods do not shed much light on the question of whether or not @xmath14 has bounded density .",
    "so , it seems desirable to obtain some information about the slices @xmath19 under weaker assumptions on @xmath14 . since kempton s result is a characterisation , however , such assumptions simply can not yield information about hausdorff measure .    in this paper ,",

    "i restrict attention to the case @xmath18 , and , like kempton , i only consider rotation and reflection free self - similar sets @xmath2 ( rrfsss in short ) . the main result in this setting",
    "is the following :    [ mainweak ] let @xmath0 be a rrfsss satisfying the strong separation condition , with @xmath1 .",
