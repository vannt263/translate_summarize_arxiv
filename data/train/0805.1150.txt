    "rare decays , induced by the flavor  changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions , is quite a promising research area and attracts theoretical interest as a potential testing ground for checking predictions of the standard model ( sm ) at loop level , as well as search for new physics effects ( np ) beyond the sm .",
    "the effects of np in rare decays can appear in two different ways : i ) via new contributions to the wilson coefficients existing in the sm , ii ) via appearance of new operators with new wilson coefficients which are absent in the present sm .",
    "the impressive and exciting results on the fcnc decays in b  meson sector were observed at two b  meson factories kek and belle @xcite , and at cleo @xcite , which are in good agreement with the sm prediction .",
    "the interest to the study of fcnc decays in t ",
    "quark sector can be explained on the following reasons : i ) in many models beyond the sm the new physics scale is closer to the t  quark mass , and ii ) many two ",
    "quark fcnc decays , like @xmath4 and @xmath5 are highly suppressed in the sm due to the gim mechanism and their branching ratios are of the order @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these branching ratios are practically impossible to measure at lhc @xcite or at international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    "but many models of np predict that the branching ratios of the above  mentioned fcnc decays are much larger compared to that obtained in the sm ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the t  quark three  body fcnc decays like @xmath7 are also discussed in the framework of sm @xcite and its beyond @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the rate of higher order three ",
    "body fcnc decay @xmath8 exceeds the rate of lower order @xmath9 decay .    as has already been noted , fcnc processes are very sensitive to the new physics effects .",
    "one such model is the so  called unparticles is recently proposed by h. georgi @xcite .",
    "the main idea in this model is that at very high energies the sm fields and the bank  zaks ( bz ) fields with a nontrivial infrared fixed point interact .",
    "the interaction between these two sectors is due to the exchange of particles with a large mass scale @xmath10 .",
    "the interaction below this scale is nonrenormalizable and is suppressed by a power of @xmath10 .",
    "the renormalizable couplings of bz fields then produce the dimensional transmutation and the scale invariant unparticle emerges below the scale @xmath2 , and the unparticle stuff with scale dimension @xmath1 , looks like massless invisible particles with noninteger number @xmath1 . for this reason ,",
    "production of unparticles might be detectable in missing energy processes .",
    "phenomenology of unparticle physics is studied extensively in the literature @xcite . in the present work we study @xmath8 ( @xmath11 ) decay in the framework of an unparticle physics .",
    "organization of this paper is as follows : in section2 calculation of the @xmath8 and @xmath11 decays are presented . in section3 numerical results and discussion are given .",
    "in this section we calculate the branching ratio of @xmath8 ( @xmath11 ) decay in unparticle physics .",
    "as we have noted already , below @xmath12 the interaction between sm fields and bz fields become an effective operator , i.e. , it has the following form : [ e9101 ] l_int = 1_u o_sm o_u  .",
    "obviously , high  dimension operators should be suppressed by inverse power of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we should choose the appropriate operators with the lowest dimension .",
    "also , the effective interaction should satisfy the sm gauge symmetry .",

    "we choose the scaling dimension @xmath1 in the range @xmath37 .",
    "the main reason for choosing @xmath38 is that in this region the decay rate is free from the nonintegrable singularity @xcite .",

    "note that the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay in the sm is calculated in @xcite which predicts @xmath44 , when the cut  off parameter @xmath45 is taken @xmath46 .",
    "our numerical calculations shows that when the cut  off parameter @xmath45 varies in the range @xmath47 for a given set of the fixed values of @xmath41 and @xmath40 , no substantial change in the value of the branching ratio is observed , the variation being about three times .",
    "the above  mentioned value of the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay in the sm is too small to be observable in the forthcoming lhc experiments .",
    "for this reason any experimental observation of the @xmath0 decay will definitely indicate the appearance of the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "therefore , the observability limit of the @xmath0 decay can be assumed to be @xmath48 . in this connection there",
    "follows the question about the range of values of @xmath1 for which the branching ratio is larger than @xmath3 , at the value @xmath12 of the cut  off parameter and at fixed values of the effective couplings",

    "it follows from the above  presented results that the restrictions to the values of @xmath1 in both decays , for which the branching ratio exceeds @xmath3 , are practically the same .    as an illustration of our analysis , we present in fig .",

    "we see that up to @xmath59 the perpendicular spin polarization exceeds the parallel spin polarization for two  gluon system at @xmath60 .",
    "these results are quite interesting since they give valuable information about the scaling parameter @xmath1 , as well as information about gluon ",
    "gluon unparticle coupling constants .    for the tensor operator case",

    "is defined as @xmath65 .",
    "similar to spin0 unparticle mediator case , we set @xmath66 in numerical calculations .",
    "it follows from this figure that , when the coupling constants of two gluon system with perpendicular and parallel spin orientations are equal , the branching ratio of the spin  perpendicular configuration exceeds the spin  parallel configuration of the two  gluon system up to @xmath67 .",
    "note that all above  presented results are obtained at @xmath68 . in this connection",
    "the question , how restrictions on @xmath1 depend on the cut  off parameter @xmath2 , should be considered . in other words , at which parametric region of @xmath1 and @xmath2 the branching ratio is larger than @xmath3 . in order to answer this question , we present in figs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) the parametric plot of the branching ratio with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath2 which gives @xmath69 , for the @xmath0 decay , at fixed the values of @xmath70 and @xmath55 , in the presence of the scalar operator .",
    "the region on the right side of each curve should be excluded , since @xmath71 in this domain .",

    ", we analyze the rare @xmath0 decay , that can exist at tree level in unparticle physics .",
    "note that these decays can take place only at loop level in the sm .",
    "for this reason the branching ratio of these decays in unparticle physics can exceed the ones predicted by the sm .",
