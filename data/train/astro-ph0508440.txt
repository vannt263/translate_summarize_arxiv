    "it was first recognised by @xcite that the ways in which extragalactic jets dissipate energy to produce observable radiation differ for high- and low - luminosity sources .",
    "jets in low - luminosity ( fri ) sources are bright close to the nucleus of the parent galaxy , whereas those in powerful ( frii ) sources are relatively faint until their terminal hot - spots .",
    "it rapidly became accepted that fri jets must decelerate by entrainment of the surrounding igm @xcite or by injection of mass lost by stars within the jet volume @xcite .",
    "more recently , evidence has accumulated that fri jets are initially relativistic and decelerate on kpc scales .",
    "fri sources are thought to be the side - on counterparts of bl lac objects , in which relativistic motion on parsec scales is well - established @xcite .",
    "proper motions corresponding to speeds comparable with and in some cases exceeding @xmath5 have been measured on milliarcsecond scales in several fri jets @xcite and on arcsecond scales in m87 and cena @xcite . in fri sources ( as in friis ) , the lobe containing the main ( brighter ) jet is less depolarized than the counter - jet lobe @xcite .",
    "this can be explained as an effect of faraday rotation in the surrounding halo of hot plasma if the main jet points toward the observer , suggesting that the brightness asymmetry is caused by doppler beaming @xcite .",
    "the decrease of this asymmetry with distance from the nucleus @xcite indicates deceleration .    the present paper is the third in a series devoted to modelling the jets in fri radio galaxies .",
    "we assume that the jets are intrinsically symmetrical , axisymmetric , relativistic flows and we parameterize their geometry and the three - dimensional variations of their velocity , emissivity and magnetic - field structure .",
    "we then compute the brightness distributions in total intensity and linear polarization . by fitting simultaneously to deep , high - resolution radio images in stokes @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we can optimize the model parameters .",
    "the fits are empirical , and make as few assumptions as possible about the ( poorly - known ) internal physics of the jets .",
    "the technique was originally developed to model the radio galaxy 3c31 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lb ) and was then slightly revised and applied to b20326 + 39 and b21553 + 24 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cl ) .",
    "we now present a model for the jets in the well - known nearby radio galaxy ngc315 .",
    "this source has a huge angular and physical size @xcite and , as we shall show , the angular scales on which flaring , recollimation and deceleration of the jets take place are much larger than in the sources we have studied so far .",
    "our results for ngc315 therefore give a more detailed picture of the initial propagation of an fri jet .    in order to improve on our empirical models",
    ", we need to understand the energy gain and loss processes affecting the ultrarelativistic particles which produce the observed synchrotron radiation . a self - consistent , axisymmetric adiabatic model fails to fit either the total intensity or the polarization distributions in the jets of 3c31 within 5kpc of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "this suggests that injection of relativistic particles and/or amplification of the magnetic field are required , which is not surprising in view of the detection of cospatial x - ray synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "further out in 3c31 , the adiabatic model gives a tolerable fit . a simple , quasi - one - dimensional analysis ( lb , cl ) is adequate to assess whether fitting of more elaborate models is worthwhile , and we apply this to ngc315 .",
    "given a kinematic model for the jets and estimates of the external density and pressure from x - ray observations , we can apply conservation of mass , momentum and energy to deduce the variations of internal pressure , density , mach number and entrainment rate with distance from the nucleus @xcite .    in section  [ obs ]",

    "m87 @xcite and cena @xcite also show component speeds which increase from pc to kpc scales .",
    "similarly , ngc6251 has been suggested as an example of an accelerating flow because its jet / counter - jet ratio increases with distance @xcite , although the detection of a counter - jet on pc scales was not confirmed by @xcite .",
    "two possible mechanisms for increase of velocity on pc scales are thermal acceleration of proton - electron plasma @xcite and magnetic driving @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite , it is unclear whether the apparent acceleration on pc scales occurs because the bulk flow accelerates or because we see different parts of a jet stratified in velocity at different distance from the core .",
    "an acceleration process which only reaches a speed of @xmath29 at 1pc is impossible to reconcile with fri radio galaxies being the parent population of tev blazars , as highly relativistic ( @xmath31 10  20 ) flow is required on 0.1-pc scales in the latter class to produce the observed @xmath32-ray emission .",
    "velocity gradients have indeed been inferred on sub - pc scales to explain the simultaneous observations of slowly - moving radio components and highly variable tev emission in blazars @xcite .",
    "similarly , although the anomalously small velocity estimate at 0.6kpc in ngc315 might well result from a random intensity fluctuation , 3c31 ( lb ) and b20326 + 39 ( cl ) also show lower sidedness ratios close to the nucleus than at the flaring point , suggesting that the material contributing the bulk of the emission in the faint region at the jet base really is slower than that further out , where our models are well constrained .",
    "we can not resolve the transverse velocity structure of the jets in their innermost regions , so it is possible that they have very fast central spines whose emission is doppler dimmed on both sides of the nucleus and that the visible emission comes from much slower surface layers .",

    "[ fig : ilo]j ) .",
    "these could be interpreted as changes in velocity in the range @xmath34 , but they show no coherent pattern , so we believe that they probably reflect intrinsic differences between the two jets .    , and directions along the apparent magnetic field , superimposed on grey - scales of total intensity for the model at a resolution of 0.4arcsec fwhm .",

    "the data are not plotted for comparison at this resolution because the signal - to - noise ratio in the counter - jet is too low , but these features are qualitatively consistent with the low - resolution images ( figs  [ fig : pol]b , c and  [ fig : ivec]b ) .",
    "[ fig : ivec.model.small],width=321 ]      the discrepancy between the predicted and observed transverse profiles of jet / counter - jet sidedness ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transside ] ) provides the first evidence that the gaussian and spine / shear - layer velocity profiles we have employed so far may be oversimplified .",
    "the effect , which is present in all three average profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transside ] , is that the sidedness ratio has a sharp peak within @xmath37 of the jet axis , drops abruptly at @xmath38 and has a flatter wing at the edge of the jet .",
    "the type of velocity profile which could produce the observed results would have a central spine of high velocity ( @xmath39 ) surrounded in turn by a relatively narrow shear layer and an outer wing with @xmath40 .",
    "there are important implications for the evolution of the magnetic field , which would be sheared only over a narrow range of radii , rather than the majority of the jet , and for the physics of the deceleration process .",
    "the other sources we have studied ( lb , cl ) show no systematic discrepancies , but are less well resolved than ngc315 in regions where they have significant changes in sidedness from axis to edge .      the boundaries between the emissivity regions , with their errors ,",

    "the emissivity profile at distances @xmath443.5kpc from the nucleus is poorly constrained ( table  [ tab : results ] ) . again , this is partly because the jets are faint and poorly resolved , but more as a consequence of the poor fit to the counter - jet ( sections  [ badfit ] ) , which causes the @xmath45 values to change very little as the model parameters are varied .",
    "the profile plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles](d ) is essentially determined by the brightness distribution of the main jet for distances @xmath193.5kpc . we model it as an inner region with a slope @xmath46 ( @xmath192.5kpc ) followed by a transition zone with a much flatter slope @xmath47 from 2.5  3.5kpc . the sudden increase in the observed surface brightness of the main jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ihi ] ) is then produced by a rapid expansion of the jet at roughly constant velocity and emissivity . the emissivity profile for the bright , well - resolved sections of the jets can be divided into two power - law sections , with indices of @xmath48 ( 3.5  9.4 kpc ) and @xmath49 ( @xmath2810.1kpc ) .",
    "these are separated by a second short transition zone over which the emissivity drops by a factor @xmath42 , modelled as a very steep power law with index @xmath50 between 9.4 and 10.1kpc ; this might also be represented as a discontinuity .",
    "the _ bright region _ ( 3.5  9.4 kpc ) contains complex , non - axisymmetric and knotty structure ( figs  [ fig : ihi]b and [ fig : ivechi]b ) , whose average is represented well but whose details are not .",
    "the outer section is , by contrast , relatively smooth .",
    "there is no evidence for any transverse variation of emissivity at the start of the bright region , although this is poorly constrained . in the outer section the edge emissivity is about half of its on - axis value ( a profile of @xmath41 at the jet edge",
    "is shown as the light , full line in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles]c ) .",
    "the bright region is clearly differentiated from the rest because its emissivity is a factor of 2 higher than expected from a smooth extrapolation between smaller and larger distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles]d ) .",
    "we also resolve the inner boundary of this region in 3c31 and b20326 + 39 ( lb , cl ) , modelling it as a discontinuous increase in emissivity .",
    "the bright region comes to an equally abrupt end , marked by an almost discontinuous drop in emissivity in ngc315 ( fig .",

    "b21553 + 24 may show a similar feature , but is less well resolved ( fig .",

    "in all three sources , the drop in emissivity occurs well before the jets recollimate .",
    "3c31 does not show any sharp decrease in emissivity .",
    "the phenomenon of sudden brightening and expansion at a _ flaring point _",
    "close to the nucleus is very common in fri jets ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the equally sudden emissivity drop at the end of the bright region has only become apparent from our modelling of ngc315 and b20326 + 39 . in both sources , the drop is located just after the start of the rapid deceleration ( @xmath51 ; see table  [ tab : results ] ) and coincides with it to within the errors . this association reinforces the argument that dissipation in fri jets , leading to enhanced radio emission and the production of synchrotron radiation at much higher frequencies , is associated mainly with their fastest parts @xcite .",

    "[ fig : bprofiles ] for on - axis and edge streamlines .",
    "all three components vary slowly out to a distance of 25kpc , after which they remain constant .",
    "the errors on the radial component are much larger than on the other two . on - axis , all three components are initially roughly equal ( i.e. the field is on average isotropic ) ; further out the toroidal component increases and the radial and longitudinal components decrease . at the edge of the jet ,",
    "the toroidal component is always the largest , and dominates over the other two at large distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bprofiles]d ) .",
    "the main field components in different parts of the jets are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgrey](d ) .",

    "@xcite suggest that the perpendicular component of _ apparent _ field in m87 is larger close to the axis and is associated preferentially with the optical knots whereas the ( mainly radio ) edge emission has its apparent field aligned with the jet axis . in our picture , the aligned apparent field at the edge comes from the projection of intrinsically longitudinal and toroidal components and the radial component is significant only on - axis .",

    "all three components could have many reversals or the toroidal component could be globally ordered , provided that the other two are not .",
    "the evolution of the radial field component along the jets is not consistent with flux freezing in our assumed velocity field . that of the toroidal and longitudinal components is qualitatively as expected , but a more complex model , including shear , is required for a quantitative test .",
    "we are currently acquiring vla data for one further source , 3c296 @xcite .",
    "we will then present model fits for all five sources using the same functional forms in order to compare their properties quantitatively .",
    "we will also investigate more complex transverse velocity profiles , as outlined in section  [ vtrans ] and develop techniques to deal with slightly bent jets .",
    "where the quasi - one - dimensional analysis presented here indicates that the adiabatic approximation is reasonable , we will fit the brightness distributions using the self - consistent adiabatic model of @xcite .",
    "once suitable x - ray observations have been made , we plan to apply the conservation - law approach of @xcite to derive the energy and momentum fluxes of the modelled jets and their variations of pressure , density and entrainment rate with distance from the nucleus .",
    "there are , as yet , no observations of jets in frii sources , or in any class of source on scales @xmath441kpc , with resolution and sensitivity adequate for detailed modelling .",
    "the advent of evla , e - merlin and broad - band vlbi should allow us to apply our techniques to more powerful ( and probably faster ) jets and to probe scales much closer to those on which jets are launched .",
