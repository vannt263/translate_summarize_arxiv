    "the term `` uv bright stars '' was introduced by zinn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for stars in globular clusters that lie above the horizontal branch ( hb ) and are bluer than red giants .",
    "the name resulted from the fact that in the u band these stars were brighter than all other cluster stars .",
    "further investigations showed that this group of stars consists of post - agb stars , evolving away from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) to the white dwarf domain ( sweigart et al .",
    ", @xcite ; de boer @xcite ) , and of so - called supra - hb stars that evolve from the blue hb ( bhb ) towards higher luminosities ( dorman et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) but do not have enough mass to ascend the agb .",
    "both evolutionary stages are immediate precursors to white dwarfs .    up to now detailed analyses",
    "have been performed mainly for post - agb stars in the field of the milky way ( mccausland et al .",
    ", @xcite ; napiwotzki et al .",
    "@xcite ) , for which the population membership is difficult to establish .",
    "the summarized result of these analyses is that the abundances of n , o , and si are roughly 1/10 of the solar values , while fe and c are closer to 1/100 solar .",
    "mccausland et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and conlon ( @xcite ) interpret the observed abundances as the results of dredge - up processes on the agb , i.e. the mixing of processed material from the stellar interior to the surface .",
    "although this hypothesis contradicts stellar evolution theories ( renzini & voli @xcite ; iben & renzini @xcite ; vassiliadis & wood @xcite ) , which do not predict any dredge - up processes for the low - mass precursors of these objects , compelling evidence that such dredge - up processes do occur is provided by k  648 , the central star of the planetary nebula ps  1 in m  15 .",
    "its atmosphere is strongly enriched in carbon when compared to the cluster carbon abundance ( heber et al . , @xcite ) pinpointing the dredge - up of triple @xmath1 processed material to the stellar surface .",
    "napiwotzki et al .  ( @xcite )",
    "discuss another possible explanation : the photospheric abundances of the pop  ii central star bd+33@xmath22642 ( and also of the objects analysed by mccausland et al .",
    ", @xcite ) can be understood as the results of gas - dust separation towards the end of the agb phase , which leads to a depletion of certain elements .",
    "this process has already been proposed by bond ( @xcite ) for some cooler post - agb stars with extreme metal deficiencies .",
    "a distinction between the two scenarios is hampered by the fact that the original metallicities remain unknown .",
    "iron is one of the elements which are most sensitive to depletion .",
    "thus the knowledge of its abundance in the uv bright stars and a comparison with the known cluster metallicity allows an unambiguous distinction between both scenarios .",
    "unfortunately , for hot metal poor stars iron is not accessible for a spectroscopic analysis from optical spectra due to the lack of lines in this wavelength region . in the ultraviolet ,",
    "however , a large number of spectral lines can be used .",
    "hence the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) of the hubble space telescope was used to measure the iron line spectra of _ roa  5701 _  and _ barnard  29_.",
    "the uv spectra of _ roa  5701 _  and _ barnard  29 _  were obtained with the goddard high resolution spectrograph onboard the hubble space telescope , equipped with the g200 m grating ( 1860 @xmath3 1906  , 0.07    resolution ) and using the large science aperture .",
    "this spectral region was chosen because the strongest absorption lines are expected there as judged from the high resolution iue spectra of bd+33@xmath22642  ( napiwotzki et al . , @xcite ) , which shows an optical spectrum similar to _ roa  5701 _  and _ barnard  29_. the exposure times were 4711 s for _ roa  5701 _  ( observed on august 3@xmath4 , 1996 ) and 4570 s for _",
    "barnard  29_(observed on november 30@xmath5 , 1996 ) .",
    "we did not use the fp split option as we did not expect any lines strong enough to allow a correct alignment of the individual spectra by correlation .",
    "after the standard pipeline reduction we co - added the flux of the individual spectra , which were on identical wavelength scales .",
    "the resulting spectra were converted to midas bdf - format and interpolated to a step size of 0.02   .",
    "they were then corrected for doppler shifts using the heliocentric radial velocities of the clusters ( + 232  km / sec , @xmath6 cen ; -246  km / sec , m  13 ) and the corrections for heliocentric velocities appropriate for the observation dates . to allow a better definition of the continuum we smoothed the spectra with a 3 pixel wide box average filter .",
    "the continuum was then defined by eye and we estimate that the error of the normalization lies between 5% and 10% .    fig .",
    "1 shows a section of the ghrs spectra of _ roa  5701 _  and _ barnard  29 _  compared to the iue data of bd+33@xmath22642 , a field post - agb star with @xmath7  and @xmath8  similar to _ roa  5701 _  and _ barnard  29_. the abundance noted for bd+33@xmath22642  in fig .",
    "1 was derived from equivalent width measurements ( napiwotzki et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) for a microturbulent velocity of 10  km / s ( which is the value conlon et al . , @xcite , derived for _",
    "barnard  29_. ) the iron abundance of bd+33@xmath22642  is comparable to that of m  13 and @xmath0 cen .",
    "the much weaker iron lines in the ghrs spectra therefore suggest that _",
    "barnard  29 _  and _ roa  5701 _  show significant iron depletions .      _",
    "roa  5701 _  was observed with the eso cassegrain echelle spectrograph ( caspec ) at the 3.6 m telescope at la silla , chile , on may 24 , 1988 .",
    "two spectra of 1 hour integration time each were obtained .",
    "the spectra were binned during read out in order to improve the s / n ratio .",
    "reduction of the data proceeded in two steps : first the eso - midas software ( ponz & brinks , @xcite ) in garching was used for wavelength calibration and extraction of the echelle orders .",
    "the background correction and flat fielding were done separately using a computer program written by g. jonas ( kiel , see heber et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "we then merged the orders of the caspec spectra and rebinned them to a common wavelength scale .",
    "the spectra have a resolution of 0.3   .",
    "we always used the normalized spectra to measure equivalent widths .",
    "the measurement in the optical spectra was straightforward since the lines are isolated and well defined and the spectra have a good s / n . in the uv , however ,",
    "the lines are more crowded and the s / n is lower .",
    "therefore , three different methods were used : i ) direct integration without any fit of the line shape using a global continuum ( assuming that the overall continuum definition is more reliable than a local one due to the low s / n ) , ii ) same as i ) , but for a local continuum , and iii ) fitting gaussians to the absorption line profiles ( using a locally defined continuum ) .",
    "method iii ) could not be used for _ roa  5701 _  because the lines were too weak .    for the ghrs data the equivalent widths measured for a global continuum ( which were used for the abundance determinations ) were on average larger than those measured for a locally defined continuum .",
    "this offset leads to a difference in the mean iron abundance of 0.08 dex for _ roa  5701 _  and 0.03  dex for _",
    "barnard  29_.    for the caspec data the equivalent widths measured for a global continuum resulted in abundances larger than those determined for a local continuum by 0.12  dex for o , 0.02  dex for n , and 0.14  dex for si . as the caspec spectra showed small - scale continuum variations that are difficult to correct for by a global continuum fit we decided to keep the abundances derived from the `` local continuum '' equivalent widths .",
    "detailed analyses of optical spectra are available for _ barnard  29 _  ( conlon et al . , @xcite ) , whereas only an estimate of the effective temperature from low resolution iue spectra ( cacciari et al",
    ". , @xcite , @xmath7  = 24000  k , @xmath9  @xmath10 ) exists for _ roa  5701_. therefore we determined the photospheric parameters of _ roa  5701 _  by analysing the optical caspec spectra together with optical photometry ( norris @xcite ) and low resolution iue spectrophotometry ( swp07849 , lwr06845 ) .    to derive a first estimate of the temperature we dereddened the optical photometry and the iue data , using the interstellar extinction law of savage & mathis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ubv magnitudes were converted into fluxes , using the conversion given by heber et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the data were then fitted with atlas9 ( kurucz @xcite ) models for [ m / h ] = @xmath31.5 . for a reddening of ( norris , @xcite ) resp .",
    "( djorgovski , @xcite ) the best fits were achieved for effective temperatures of 22000  k resp .",
    "24000  k. these results compare very well to those of cacciari et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    for the temperatures given above we fitted atlas9 model spectra with solar helium abundances and [ m / h ]  =  @xmath31.5 to the balmer lines and obtained the surface gravities from the best fit .",
    "to verify our results we also derived effective temperature , surface gravity , and helium abundances from the balmer and line profiles only . for this purpose we calculated model atmospheres using atlas9 ( kurucz 1991 , priv .",
    "comm . ) and used the linfor spectrum synthesis program ( developed originally by holweger , steffen , and steenbock at kiel university ) to compute a grid of theoretical spectra , which include the balmer lines h@xmath11 to h@xmath12 and lines .",
    "the grid covered the range 10000  27500  k in @xmath7 , 2.5  5.0 in @xmath8  and @xmath32.0  @xmath30.3 in @xmath13  at a metallicity of @xmath31 .",
    "for the actual fit we used the routines developed by bergeron et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and saffer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which employ a @xmath14 test .",
    "the results of all procedures are listed in table  1 .",
    "it is clear that the agreement is rather good . for the further analysis we used the mean value of the iue derived results , i.e. an effective temperature of 23000  k and a log  g value of 3.3 .    [ cols= \" < ,",

    "the results of our abundance analyses are given in table  5 , where we also give the results of conlon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and dixon & hurwitz ( @xcite ) for _ barnard  29_. a comparison of our results with rgb and cooler uv bright stars ( only in @xmath0 cen ) is presented in figs . 2 and 3 . the m  13 data in fig .",

    "( @xcite ) , the data for the cool uvbs are from gonzalez & wallerstein ( @xcite ) .",
    "all abundances were adjusted to a solar iron abundance of @xmath17  =  7.50 .    as can be seen from fig .  2 _",
    "barnard  29 _  shows similar abundance trends ( except for iron ) as the giant stars observed in m  13 .",
    "this abundance pattern is likely caused by deep mixing and dredge - up of cno - processed material on the first rgb ( pilachowski et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the iron abundance we found for _ barnard  29 _  is lower than the cluster value by 0.5dex .",
    "this indicates that the atmosphere of _",
    "barnard  29 _  has become iron depleted during the star s evolution , most likely by the gas - dust separation proposed by bond ( @xcite ) and discussed by napiwotzki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which is also favoured by dixon & hurwitz ( @xcite ) for _ barnard  29_. this scenario assumes that the dust formed in the cool and extended atmospheres of agb stars is selectively removed by radiation pressure , while the gas remains at the stellar surface .",
    "since metals with high condensation temperatures ( e.g. iron ) preferentially condense into dust grains and elements with lower condensation temperatures remain in the gas phase , the remaining gas forms a iron - poor atmosphere .",
    "mathis & lamers ( @xcite ) discussed a single - star and a binary scenario , which can both result in a selective removal of dust at the end of the agb stage .",
    "the interpretation of the abundance pattern of _ roa  5701 _  is hampered by the complex patterns found in @xmath0cen stars in general ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 ) . if we take as a metallicity tracer the sum of c , n , and o abundances ( which remains unchanged by cno processing ) , we find that the original metallicity of _ roa  5701 _  is close to the median value determined for cluster stars ( cf . fig .  4 ) .",
    "however , the iron abundance is 0.5  dex below the lowest value found for any rgb star plotted in fig .",
    "this points to an iron depletion similar to that detected in _",
    "barnard  29 _ , which also shows a similar behaviour in fig .",
    "4 .    in summary , the c , n , o , and",
    "si abundances of _",
    "barnard  29 _  and _ roa  5701 _  are in agreement with that of the respective cluster red giant stars .",
    "no dredge - up during the agb phase is necessary to explain these abundance patterns , although a moderate third dredge - up can not be ruled out from our data alone .",
    "however , our low iron abundances point towards a significant iron depletion , most probably caused by a gas - dust separation during the late agb stages .",
