    "resonance energy transfer ( ret ) between spatially separated molecules @xcite plays an important role in diverse phenomena across physics , chemistry and biology .",
    "examples include photosynthesis , exciton transfer in molecular aggregates , energy exchange between proteins , @xcite and , more recently , between excitons in quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite and in qd - protein assemblies.@xcite during past decade , significant advances were made in ret enhancement and control by placing molecules or qds in microcavities @xcite or near metal films and nanoparticles ( nps).@xcite the coupling between molecular dipoles and surface plasmons ( sp ) in metal opens up new ret channels .",
    "the ability to control ret rates by adjusting dipoles positions relative to metal surface is important in biomedical applications @xcite such as , e.g. , sp biosensors.@xcite    near plasmonic nanostructure , ret from a donor to an acceptor is governed by the interplay between several processes .",
    "the energy of the excited donor can either be radiated , dissipated , or absorbed by the acceptor and each of these channels is affected by the nearby metal in its own way . in a closely related phenomenon , plasmon - enhanced fluorescence , the decay rates in nonradiative and radiative channels depend differently on the distance between molecule and metal surface , @xmath0 .",
    "the measured fluorescence@xcite from molecules attached to a metal np indeed shows that with decreasing @xmath0 , sp enhancement is followed by quenching , in agreement with theory.@xcite a similar , albeit somewhat more complicated , scenario is expected when a donor _ and _ an acceptor molecules are placed nearby a plasmonic nanostructure ; i.e. , the energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor should be strongly affected by dissipation in metal and by plasmon - enhanced radiation .",
    "however , no ret theory including all relevant energy flow channels has yet been available .",
    "it is our goal to provide such a theory here .    to highlight the issue ,",
    "recall the famous frster s formula for energy @xmath1 transferred from donor to acceptor @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the donor s radiated energy , @xmath4 is its spectral function , @xmath5 is the acceptor s absorption crosssection , @xmath6 is the dipoles electromagnetic coupling at distance @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the wavevector of light . in the near field ( @xmath9 ) , we have @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the orientational factor ) and ret changes with distance as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is frster s radius . in the far field ( @xmath14 ) , ret is dominated by radiative coupling @xmath15 leading to weaker @xmath16 dependence.@xcite eq .",
    "( [ fret - trad ] ) is derived from _ first - order _ transition probability under the perturbation @xmath6 .",
    "for molecules near a plasmonic nanostructure , eq .",
    "( [ fret - trad ] ) must be modified .",
    "the standard model by gersten and nitzan @xcite and its extensions to planar and composite systems @xcite incorporate sp in the transition s intermediate states , and thus eq .",
    "( [ fret - trad ] ) still holds albeit with new coupling @xmath17 which now includes sp - mediated channels .",
    "however , this model accounts for neither dissipation in metal nor plasmon - enhanced radiation channels and , as a result , yields enormous ( up to @xmath18 ) ret enhancement that contrasts sharply with the much more modest ( @xmath19 ) increase @xcite and even reduction @xcite of measured ret rates .    here",
    "we present a unified theory for ret near metal nanostructures based on the classical approach that accounts accurately for the full energy flow in the system .",
    "we show that eq .",
    "( 1 ) is replaced with @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the donor s _ free space _ radiative decay rate , @xmath22 is its _ full _ decay rate , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the modified spectral function and absorption cross section , respectively , and the coupling @xmath25 includes high - order sp - assisted transitions . for a low - yield donor , @xmath21 should be replaced with the free space fluorescence rate @xmath26 .",

    "depending on system geometry , ret can either be enhanced or reduced as compared to frster s transfer , consistent with experiment.@xcite     ( color online ) ret vs distance for @xmath27 nm ag np is shown at @xmath28 with ( a ) @xmath29 and ( b ) @xmath30 nm , @xmath31 using the full eq .",
