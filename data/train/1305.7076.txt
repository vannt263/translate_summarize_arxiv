    "the following _ firefighter problem _ on a graph @xmath0 was introduced by hartnell at a conference in 1995  @xcite .",
    "suppose that a fire breaks out at a given vertex @xmath1 .",
    "in each subsequent time unit ( called a turn ) , a firefighter _ protects _ one vertex which is not yet on fire and then the fire spreads to all unprotected neighbors of the vertices already on fire .",
    "once a vertex is on fire or is protected it stays in such state forever .",
    "protecting a vertex is in essence equivalent to deleting it from the graph .",
    "the game stops if no neighbor of the vertices on fire is unprotected and the fire can not spread .",
    "if the graph is finite , the game finishes at some point and the goal of the firefighter is to save as many vertices as possible . in case of an infinite graph ,",
    "the goal of the firefighter is to stop the fire from spreading or , if this is not possible , to save as many vertices as possible in the limit ( we introduce this graph parameter in section  [ sec : inf_graphs ] ) .",
    "today , almost 20 years later , our knowledge about this problem is much greater and a number of papers have been published .",
    "we would like to refer the reader to the survey of finbow and macgillivray for more information  @xcite .    for finite graphs , we focus on the following property .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the number of vertices in @xmath2 the firefighter can save when the fire breaks out at a vertex @xmath1 , assuming the best strategy is used .",
    "then let @xmath8 be the proportion of vertices saved ( here and throughout the paper , @xmath9 denotes the number of vertices of @xmath2 , assuming @xmath2 is finite ) . the _ surviving rate _ @xmath3 of @xmath2 , introduced in  @xcite , is defined as the expected @xmath10 when the fire breaks out at a random vertex @xmath11 of @xmath2 ( uniform distribution is used ) , that is , @xmath12    for example , it is not difficult to see that for cliques @xmath13 , since no matter where the fire breaks out only one vertex can be saved . for paths we get that @xmath14 ( one can save all but one vertex when the fire breaks out at one of the leaves ; otherwise two vertices are burned ) .",
    "it is not surprising that almost all vertices on a path can be saved , and in fact , all trees have this property .",
    "cai , cheng , verbin , and zhou  @xcite proved that the greedy strategy of hartnell and li  @xcite for trees saves at least @xmath15 percentage of vertices on average for an @xmath9-vertex tree .",
    "moreover , they managed to prove that for every outer - planar graph @xmath2 , @xmath16 .",
    "both results are asymptotically tight and improved upon earlier results of cai and wang  @xcite .",
    "( note that there is no hope for a similar result for planar graphs , since , for example , @xmath17 . )",
    "however , this does not mean that it is easy to find the exact value of @xmath3 .",
    "it is known that the decision version of the firefighter problem is np - complete even for trees of maximum degree three  @xcite .    moving to another interesting direction",
    ", the third author of this paper showed that any graph @xmath2 with average degree strictly smaller than @xmath18 has the surviving rate bounded away from zero  @xcite and showed that this result is sharp ( the construction uses a mixture of deterministic and random graphs ) .",
    "( see  @xcite for a generalization of this result for the @xmath19-many firefighter problem . )",
    "these results improved earlier observations of finbow , wang , and wang  @xcite .",
    "first , we study the surviving rate of @xmath4 , the cartesian product of two paths of length @xmath20 .",
    "it was announced by cai and wang that @xmath21 but a formal proof has not been published .",
    "we will prove the following result , which provides much better upper bound .",
    "[ thm : finite ] for the cartesian product of two paths we have @xmath22    our proof for the upper bound is not very sophisticated and there are ways to improve it . on the other hand , it narrows down the surviving rate to a small interval smaller than 0.0136 .",
    "it is natural to conjecture the following but this still remains open .",
    "@xmath23 .    for an infinite graph @xmath0",
    ", the primary goal is to determine if the fire can be stopped from spreading or not .",
    "all graphs we discuss here are vertex transitive so the choice of the starting point is irrelevant .",
    "it is known ( and easy to show ) that it is impossible to surround the fire with one firefighter in the infinite cartesian grid ( see  @xcite ) . on the other hand , it is clear that two firefighters can stop the fire ( that is when two vertices can be protected in each round ) and in  @xcite the optimal strategy was provided that does it in 8 steps .",
    "( see  @xcite for a fractional version of this problem . )",
    "it was proved in  @xcite that if the fire breaks out on the triangular grid , three firefighters contain the fire easily , but the proof that two firefighters can not contain the fire is unfortunately flawed ( as we discuss below ) and this question is still open .",
    "@xmath24 , we show that it is optimal to save a @xmath25 wedge of vertices . in section  [ sec : inf_graphs ] we formally introduce a measure of the surviving rate for infinite graphs and show that @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 , we show that one firefighter can save 2/3 of the grid , and with just a little additional help of two extra protected vertices , it is possible to stop the fire from spreading :    [ thm : hex ] @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , if the firefighter is allowed to protect one extra vertex at time @xmath29 and one at time @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( possibly with @xmath32 ) , the firefighter will contain the fire on @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the strategy does not need to know @xmath29 and @xmath30 in advance .",
    "we also show a strategy to slow down the fire by a constant factor in the following sense . here and throughout the paper @xmath33 denotes the @xmath34-th neighborhood of @xmath11 in the graph @xmath2 , and @xmath35 .",
    "[ thm : hex_slowdown ] there exists a universal constant @xmath36 such that when only finitely many vertices of @xmath27 are burning , there exist a vertex @xmath37 and a strategy such that for every large enough @xmath38 all vertices burning after turn @xmath38 are contained in @xmath39 .",
    "finally , even though one can contain the fire with just 2 extra protected vertices and can slow down the fire , we conjecture that one firefighter per turn alone still can not stop the fire from spreading .",
    "[ con : hex_not_saved ] if a fire breaks out on the hexagonal grid , one firefighter does not suffice to contain the fire .",

    "this contradicts a statement in  @xcite in the proof of theorem 21 stating that two firefighters can not contain the fire on the triangular grid .",
    "the proof has been noted to be flawed by one of the reviewers and perhaps others .",
    "indeed , in the proof of theorem 21 in  @xcite it is incorrectly stated that @xmath42 ( @xmath43 in our notation ) , but that does not hold for every @xmath44 ( burning part of @xmath45 in their paper ) as required by theorem  1 of  @xcite ; for example with @xmath46 with @xmath47 not on cone boundary we have @xmath48 .",
    "our result shows that it is not possible to prove that two firefighters are not sufficient argumenting only with the burning vertices of @xmath49 in turn @xmath34 , as there might be none , but it would still seem possible ( or even likely ) that two firefighters can not contain the fire on the triangular grid . as far as we know , this has been conjectured but we are not aware of any written reference .",

    "this follows from the fact that only the vertices of @xmath68 will ever cause new fire and assuming more vertices to be burning only helps the fire .",
    "interchanging burning non - active fires with protected vertices makes no difference for the progress of the game ( except for counting saved vertices ) , as non - active vertices will never spread fire .",

    ", the correctness of the construction follows from the fact that in turn @xmath19 , the firefighters play to vertices in @xmath108 , avoiding any possibly burning vertices .",
    "the rest of the proof is almost identical to that of theorem  [ thm : hex_slowdown ] , namely the choice of @xmath91 , the overall situation within the cones is identical to figure  [ fig : hex - spiral ]  ( a ) , and the resulting constant can be chosen within the same interval , that is @xmath104 for @xmath38 large enough .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for pointing out the relationship between strategies for @xmath27 and for @xmath40 .",
