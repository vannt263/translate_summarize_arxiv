    "daubechies wavelets@xcite are an orthonormal basis that explicitly separates scales .",
    "the basis functions are generated from a single set of functions @xmath1 by dyadic dilatations and translations .",
    "each basis function is expressed as ^(n)_t(x)(x ) = 2 ^ -nd/2 _",
    "t(2 ^ -n(x - x ) ) , where @xmath2 is the scale , @xmath3 the position on a grid @xmath4 with spacing @xmath5 , and @xmath6 determines how the @xmath7-dimensional wavelet is composed of one - dimensional functions .",
    "the resulting wavelet fields naturally live on lattices @xmath8 of a dyadic multigrid .",
    "it was proved only by daubechies that a compact basis with these features ( and good analytical properties ) exists .",
    "it appears a natural basis to perform renormalization in . in this contribution , we demonstrate how a wavelet basis can be used to exhibit explicitly the interscale coupling introduced by the @xmath0 term and how an approximation to the renormalization flow in the landau - ginzburg/@xmath0 model can be derived from this .",
    "we consider the landau - ginzburg/@xmath0 theory @xcite with a one - component real order parameter @xmath9 , @xmath10 , governed by the hamiltonian [ eq2 ] h = ^dx with coupling constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the field is expanded in a wavelet basis : [ eq1 ] s(x ) = _ n _ t^n_t _",
    "x^n s^(n)_t(x ) ^(n)_t(x)(x ) + s_0 since wavelets have vanishing first moments , we use the real number @xmath13 to represent the overall magnetization of the system , while the @xmath14 represent fluctuations at different scales .",
    "[ figmc ] shows their strength @xmath15 ^ 2 \\right\\rangle$ ] as measured in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "as they show very clearly the location of the phase transition , we will focus on modelling these quantities .",
    ", measured in a monte carlo simulation[figmc ] ]    we thus make the variational ansatz that fluctuations are gaussian and diagonal in wavelet space : [ eq3 ] s^(n_1)_t_1(x_1 ) s^(n_2)_t_2(x_2 ) = _ n_1,n_2 _ t_1,t_2 _ x_1,x_2 a^(n_1)_t_1 note that local fluctuations in wavelet space still provide for a nontrivial correlator in position space , as the decay of the correlator is encoded in the relative strength of fluctuations at different scales @xmath16 .    the magnitude of the fluctuations @xmath17",
    "is then found by the variational method from minimizing the free energy @xmath18 where the internal energy @xmath19 is the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath20 in the gaussian ensemble ( [ eq3 ] ) , and @xmath21 the entropy of this ensemble .",
    "when calculating the internal energy , the self - similarity of the wavelet basis comes into play : as all basis functions are built from a single mother wavelet , the matrix elements of the laplace operator have a simple scaling form : + & & = 2 ^ -2n c_t_1,t_2 .",
    "similarly , the four - point overlap integral occurring from the @xmath0 term has an approximate scaling representation . in this approximation ,",
    "the effective internal energy per site reads simply & = & _ nt 2 ^ -n(d+2 ) ( -c_tt ) n_t + & & + a + a^2 + 3 u_0 |s^2 a + & & + |s^2 + |s^4 ( @xmath22 ) with the fluctuation sum = _ n _ t 2 ^ -nd n_t . while the gaussian terms are linear in the fluctuation strengths , the @xmath0 term introduces a coupling between scales .",
    "since wavelets have compact support , the overlap integrals and thus the nonlinear contribution is finite , as opposed to the situtation with a fourier basis .",
    "the canonical dimension @xmath23 of the laplace operator enters in the weight factor of the first term .    minimizing the free energy now with respect to the magnetization @xmath24 yields [ eq4 ] |s = 0 |s = .",
    "thus spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the fluctuation sum @xmath25 exceeds the critical value @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , minimizing with respect to the @xmath27 results in [ eq5 ] n_t = this is an implicit equation for the fluctuation sum @xmath25 that can be solved numerically .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows such a solution .    ,",
    "calculated from minimizing the effective internal energy.[fig1 ] ]    for @xmath28 , ( [ eq5 ] ) would be the wavelet representation of a exponentially decaying correlator with inverse correlation length @xmath29 .",
    "we can see that the interaction leads to a redefinition of the inverse correlation length depending on the quantity @xmath25 which is defined implicitly by this equation .",
    "in particular , the correlation length diverges at the same point as the second solution in ( [ eq4 ] ) becomes real , signifying the phase transition .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     to derive the renormalization group flow of the theory",
    ", we apply the idea of removing the fine degrees of freedom to the minimization of the free energy , i.e. , we perform the minimization scale by scale .",
    "assume there exists a lowest scale @xmath30 , e.g.  by already having eliminated all scales finer than @xmath16 .",
    "we can then minimize the free energy with respect to @xmath31 , keeping all coarser scales as variables .",
    "@xmath31 will then become a function of the @xmath32 , @xmath33 . by reinserting this function in the expression for the free energy and expanding in a taylor series , one reaches a new effective free energy , now only depending on @xmath32 , @xmath33 , in which the new terms arising from the expansion can be absorbed ( to some order ) in a redefinition of the coupling constants .",
    "this yields a renormalization flow as a mapping @xmath34 in the coupling constant plane .",
    "it turns out that there exists the gaussian fixed point @xmath35 , and in @xmath36 a second fixed point , corresponding to the wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "the actual position of the fixed points still depends on the matrix element of the laplacian @xmath37 and thus on the type of wavelet .",
    "this shows a limitation of our approximation as we disregarded the correlation between neighboring wavelets which is basically determined by the extent of the wavelet .",
    "a wavelet expansion can be used to derive the properties of the landau - ginzburg model and its nontrivial renormalization flow even in a rather simple approximation .",
    "the crucial features we have made use of are scaling and self - similarity of the basis and locality of the basis functions",
    ". they enabled us to focus on the fluctuation strengths at different scales as the quantities of interest that govern the phase transition .",
    "the effective free energy of the system exhibits in a minimal way the coupling between different scales ."
