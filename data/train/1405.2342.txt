    "the evolution of planetary systems takes place over a wide range of timescales .",
    "current theories regarding how planets form suggest that the first hundred million years of a star s life is a time of great activity .",
    "giant planets form within a few million years and can then potentially migrate large distances , or interact gravitationally and scatter onto highly eccentric orbits , leading to possibly tidal capture by the parent star or , in the opposite extreme , ejection from the system entirely ( see wu & murray 2003 ; ida & lin 2004 ; fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ; naoz et al .",
    "2011 ; bromley & kenyon 2011 ; miguel , guilera & brunini 2011 ; nagasawa & ida 2011 ; kley & nelson 2012 ; mordasini et al .",
    "2012 for a representative but incomplete sampling of opinions on this wide ranging subject ) .",
    "the formation of planets of lower mass is generally held to be more sedate , whether it be by a form of communal migration or in situ assembly ( raymond , barnes & mandell 2008 ; ida & lin 2010 ; ogihara , duncan & ida 2010 ; hansen & murray 2012 , 2013 ; chiang & laughlin 2013 ; raymond et al . 2013 ) .",
    "nevertheless , studies in our own solar system indicate that even these nominally sedate planetary orbits comprise a chaotic dynamical system ( laskar 1989 ; sussman & wisdom 1992 ; lithwick & wu 2011 ) , and that some of the terrestrial planets may ultimately prove to be dynamically unstable ( e.g. batygin & laughlin 2008 ; laskar & gastineau 2009 ) .",
    "the theme of dynamical stability in planetary systems is therefore of broad interest , and has already attracted significant attention .",
    "the discovery of compact , densely packed planetary systems in recent years has only heightened the interest and presents several issues regarding the nature of the planets themselves , and whether the currently observed configurations are sculpted by the original formation or by dynamical processes on longer timescales . furthermore , many planets have been discovered close to their parent stars , so that tidal dissipation is expected to rapidly damp eccentricities .",
    "our goal in this work is to study the long - term evolution of low - mass , compact , multiple planet systems , under the influence of tidal dissipation , while also accounting for the secular gravitational coupling between the planets .",
    "this has been a subject of some interest for gas giant planets , which are often found in strongly hierarchical systems ( wu & goldreich 2002 ; adams & laughlin 2006a ; mardling 2007 ; batygin , bodenheimer & laughlin 2009 ; correia et al .",
    "2011 ; greenberg & van laerhoven 2011 ; zhang , hamilton & matsumura 2013 ) .",
    "we wish to extend it to the realm of lower mass planetary systems recently discovered by both radial velocity ( howard et al .",
    "2010 ; mayor et al . 2011 ) and transiting methods ( borucki et al . 2011 ; batalha et al .",
    "in order to do this , we need to address the issue of large multiplicity and the stronger tidal dissipation anticipated for terrestrial class planets . in   [ arch ] we will describe the initial configurations of the planets under study and our model for tidal dissipation is given in ",
    "[ tides ] .   [ results ] then examines the effects of this combination for the long - term structure of these planetary systems .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a better comparison with our own solar system can be achieved by comparing the eigenfrequencies of the compact systems with those of known systems of multiple giant planets .",
    "table  [ giantpairs ] lists three pairs of giant planets from the compilation of wright et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , chosen so that we have at least two planets with semi - major axis @xmath1au , which therefore make plausibly stable exterior systems for our model compact systems .",
    "figure  [ gscan2 ] shows the eigenfrequencies ( dotted lines ) of these pairs , compared with the ensemble of eigenfrequencies shown in figure  [ gscan ] .",
    "also shown ( dotted lines ) are the two highest eigenfrequencies of the solar system giant planet modes , quoted in murray & dermott ( 1999 ) .",
    "although it requires a little fine tuning to match up the eigenfrequencies in any given system , the density of overlap between the ensembles suggests that there is much potential for overlap and interaction if there is even a little bit of drift in the frequencies during the formation process  either due to the evaporation of the nascent gas disk ( ward 1981 ) or due to planetesimal - driven evolution amongst the outer planets ( thommes , duncan & levison 1999 ; tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 ) .    ,",
    "plotted against the orbital period of the dominant planet in each mode .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines indicate the eigenfrequencies of the giant - planet - pair systems given in table  [ giantpairs ] .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the two highest eigenfrequencies associated with the giant planets in our own solar system .",
    "the largest of these is a jupiter - saturn mode , while the smaller contains significant contributions from jupiter , saturn and uranus .",
    "the amount of overlap between the compact and giant planet systems suggests that a rich dynamical coupling is possible .",
    "[ gscan2],width=317 ]     plus the two giant planets of hd183263 .",
    "three eigenvalues are not shown as they are sufficiently separated from the others that they do nt evolve .",
    "the curves are labelled with the numbers of the planets ( counting outwards ) which contribute at least 10% to the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector amplitude ( at the beginning of the evolution ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the evolution of the root mean square eccentricity of each of the 6 inner planets , with substantial eccentricity changes associated with several of the resonance crossings . as before ,",
    "the net effect of this is often to accelerate the tidal evolution .",
    "[ pump2],width=317 ]    such interactions have been discussed by several authors in the context of our own solar system .",
    "the low eccentricities of the terrestrial planets suggest that such interactions must have been weak unless there was substantial dissipation at later times ( ward 1981 ; agnor & lin 2012 ) and could also influence the original assembly of the planets ( levison & agnor 2003 ; nagasawa , lin & ida , 2003 ; nagasawa , lin & thommes 2008 ; raymond , barnes & mandell 2008 ; thommes , nagasawa & lin 2008 ) . to illustrate the potential for such interactions with the model systems discussed here , figure  [ pump2 ] shows the evolution of the system shown in figure  [ snap1 ] , when paired with the giant planet pair orbiting hd183263 .",
    "these giant planets are both massive , and with substantial orbital eccentricity , so they will provide greater perturbations than the giant planets of our own solar system .",
    "indeed , we see that the tidal evolution of this system exhibits a substantial amount of interaction , with multiple resonance crossings . these are driven by both the modifications to the eigenvalues introduced by the additional planets and the greater tidal evolution because of the larger secular pumping of the eccentricities .",
    "indeed , the inner planet ends up at 0.011  au , instead of at 0.046  au when evolved without the giant planets . of course",
    ", the eccentricities in this case reach values that are probably too large for an accurate treatment with classical linear secular theory , but this does indicate the prospects for more dramatic evolution when such compact planetary systems are paired with the giant planet populations already observed .",
    "in particular , the angular momentum deficit @xmath2 in such systems is high enough to open up the possibility of secular chaos and further dynamical evolution .",
    "this echoes the situation in our own solar system , where the secular effects that imperil mercury are a consequence of the interaction with the precession of jupiter ( laskar 1994 ; batygin & laughlin 2008 ; laskar & gastineau 2009 ; wu & lithwick 2011 ) .",
    "such dynamical evolution may help to explain the puzzling excess of low multiplicity systems in the kepler database ( hansen & murray 2013 ) .",
    "we have investigated the long - term evolution of compact planetary systems composed of terrestrial - class planets , under the action of tidal dissipation and secular gravitational interactions .",
    "we have addressed the difficulty of fully characterising observed systems by studying the evolution of the model systems discussed in hansen & murray ( 2013 ) . in that paper",
    ", we demonstrated that these simulations broadly reproduced the observed properties of the kepler multiple planet systems , in terms of multiplicities and orbital spacing , and so their secular interactions should represent a qualitatively representative sample of those found in the observed systems .",
    "our results suggest that , for tidal dissipation similar to that found in earth - like planets , a variety of dynamical interactions can ensue , including resonances between different secular modes and the crossing of mean motion resonances .",
    "the secular couplings can also extend the reach of tidal circularisation by an order of magnitude , circularising the orbits out to periods @xmath0  days in most cases .",
    "however , eccentricities @xmath3 remain in a minority of cases , resulting either from the decoupling of the secular interactions into multiple weakly - connected subsystems or from the late - time crossing of a secular resonance which can redistribute angular momentum amongst the planets and re - excite the eccentricity of short period planets .",
    "the secular pumping of eccentricity also helps to drive the inward migration of the inner planets , resulting in shorter final orbital periods than would result from individual planet migration .",
    "in particular , this can result in planets with final orbital periods that lie inside the so - called dust sublimation radius , because they assembled from smaller bodies farther out and then were driven in by tidal dissipation enhanced by secular eccentricity pumping .",
    "the closest orbital periods found in these simulations were @xmath4  days , but planets could be driven in further if they interact with more massive planets than considered here .",
    "the secular interactions drive migration of the innermost planet primarily , with the result that the period ratio between the closest and second closest planets diverge substantially , while the period ratios of planets farther out do not . this may help to explain the observation of steffen & farr ( 2013 ) , that the period ratios of the innermost pairs in kepler systems are larger , on average , than those of more distant pairs .",
    "we evolve models composed solely of rocky planets with masses @xmath5 , within the context of classical secular perturbation theory . as such ,",
    "our calculations represent the linear superposition of individual modes and can not probe the possibilities of chaotic evolution due to nonlinear couplings .",
    "however , the level of the angular momentum deficit in these systems is low enough that significant dynamical instability may not occur because , in most cases , orbit crossing can not be achieved even if all of the system s angular momentum deficit were concentrated in a single mode .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that this is the result of the low planetary masses considered .",
    "if the assembling planets capture significant gas mass from the surrounding nebula ( e.g. hansen & murray 2012 ) , or are accompanied by a giant planet system at larger radii , the injection of significant additional amplitude could substantially modify the system evolution .",
    "this is an attractive possibility for explaining the excess of low multiplicity systems seen in the kepler sample ( lissauer et al .",
    "2011 ; dong & tremaine 2012 , fang & margot 2012 ; hansen & murray 2013 ) and will be examined in detail in a forthcoming paper .    finally , we note that these simulations are chosen because they resemble the statistical properties of the observed planetary systems . as such , even though the systems are the result of in situ assembly calculations , they can qualitatively represent the outcomes of any formation scenario that produces a similar range of masses and separations .",
    "however , the degree of evolution does depend on the initial level of eccentricity in the system .",
    "although not large , the initial eccentricities from the assembly simulations are definitely non - zero . a system born with zero eccentricity ( perhaps due to dissipation from the gaseous nebula ) would evolve less .",
    "of course , if the eccentricities are excited due to dynamical instabilities that result from the dissipation of the nebula , then the level of subsequent tidal evolution is likely to be similar to that found here .",
