    "dedicated to the memory of russian mathematician vladimir andreevich steklov , a recent article in the notices of the american mathematical society discuss his remarkable contributions to the development of science @xcite .",
    "one of his main contributions is on the study of the ( second - order ) steklov eigenvalue problem , @xmath2 named in his honor . here",
    ", @xmath3 is a bounded open set with lipschitz boundary @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the laplace operator , @xmath6 denotes the normal derivative , and @xmath7 denotes the eigenpair .",
    "the steklov spectrum is of fundamental interest as it coincides with the spectrum of the dirichlet - to - neumann operator @xmath8 , given by the formula @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the unique harmonic extension of @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "it also arises in the study of sloshing liquids and heat flow .",
    "the steklov spectrum is discrete and we enumerate the eigenvalues in increasing order , @xmath13 .",
    "weyl s law for steklov eigenvalues , the asymptotic rate at which they tend to infinity , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unit ball in @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues also have a variational characterization , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the corresponding @xmath19th eigenfunction .",
    "it follows from that steklov eigenvalues satisfy the homothety property @xmath20 .",
    "we describe a number of previous results for extremal steklov problems in section [ sec : relwork ] .      in this short paper , we develop fast and robust computational methods for extremal steklov eigenvalue problems .",
    "we apply these methods to the shape optimization problem @xmath21 note that @xmath22 is invariant to dilations , so is equivalent to maximizing @xmath23 subject to @xmath24 .",
    "a computational study of this problem for values of @xmath0 between 1 and 101 suggests that the optimal domains are very structured and supports the following conjecture .",
    "[ optdom ] the maximizer , @xmath25 , of @xmath26 in is unique ( up to dilations and rigid transformations ) , has @xmath0-fold symmetry , and an axis of symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0-th steklov eigenvalue has multiplicity 2 if @xmath0 is even and multiplicity 3 if @xmath27 is odd .",
    "furthermore , as described in section  [ sec : numres ] , the associated eigenspaces are also very structured .",
    "this structure stands in stark contrast with previous computational studies for extremal eigenvalue problems involving the dirichlet- and neumann - laplacian spectra @xcite .",
    "in particular , denoting the dirichlet- and neumann - laplacian eigenvalues of @xmath28 by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , computational results suggest that the optimizers for the following shape optimization problems do not seem to have structure : @xmath31 the only exception that we are aware of is when the optimal value is attained by a ball or a sequence of domains which degenerates into the disjoint union of balls .    for the problems listed above",
    ", we also note that the largest value of @xmath0 for which these previous studies have been able to access is @xmath32 . here",
    ", we compute the optimal domains for @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; our ability to compute optimal domains for such large values of @xmath0 arises from ( 1 ) a very efficient and accurate steklov eigenvalue solver and ( 2 ) a slight reformulation of the eigenvalue optimization problem that significantly reduces the number of eigenvalue evaluations required .      in section  [ sec : relwork ] , we review some related work .",
    "computational methods are described in section  [ sec : compmeth ] .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section  [ sec : numres ] and we conclude in section  [ sec : disc ] with a brief discussion .",
    "here we briefly survey some related work ; a more comprehensive review can be found in @xcite and a historical viewpoint with applications in @xcite .    in 1954 , r. weinstock proved that the disk maximizes the first non - trivial steklov eigenvalue of @xmath35 among _ simply - connected _ planar domains with a fixed total mass @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an @xmath38 non - negative weight function on the boundary , referred to as the `` density '' @xcite . it remains an open question for non - simply - connected bounded planar domains @xcite . in 1974 ,",
    "j. hersch , l. e. payne , and m. m. schiffer proved a general isoperimetric inequality for simply - connected planar domains which , in a special case , can be expressed @xmath39 in @xcite , a. girouard and i. polterovich provided an alternative proof based on complex analysis to show that disk maximizes the first non - trivial steklov eigenvalue .",
    "furthermore , they proved that the maximum of second eigenvalue is not attained in the class of simply - connected domain instead by a sequence of simply - connected domains degenerating to a disjoint union of two identical disks . in @xcite , a. girouard and",
    "i. polterovich proved that the bound in ( [ hps ] ) is sharp and attained by a sequence of simply - connected domains degenerating into a disjoint union of @xmath40 identical balls .",
    "an extension of r. weinstock s result to arbitrary riemannian surfaces @xmath41 with genus @xmath42 and @xmath43 boundary components was given by a. fraser and r. schoen in @xcite .",
    "the inequality @xmath44 derived therein reduces to r. weinstock s result for @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the bound is sharp .",
    "however , for @xmath45 and @xmath47 , the bound is not sharp .",
    "see @xcite for a better upper bound on annulus surfaces . in @xcite , it is proven that there exists a constant @xmath48 , such that for every bounded domain @xmath49 , @xmath50 a generalization for riemannian manifolds is also given .    other objective functions depending on steklov eigenvalues were also considered . in @xcite , j. hersch , l. e. payne , and m. m. schiffer proved that the minimum of @xmath51 is attained when @xmath12 is a disk for both perimeter and area constraints .",
    "this result is generalized to arbitrary dimensions in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is proven that sums of squared reciprocal steklov eigenvalues , @xmath52 , for simply - connected domains with a fixed perimeter is minimized by a disk .",
    "the sharp isoperimetric upper bounds were found for the sum of first @xmath43-th eigenvalues , partial sums of the spectral zeta function , and heat trace for starlike and simply - connected domains using quasiconformal mappings to a disk @xcite .",
    "there are also a few computational studies of extremal steklov problems .",
    "the most relevant is recent work of b. bogosel @xcite .",
    "this paper is primary concerned with the development of methods based on fundamental solutions to compute the steklov , wentzell , and laplace - beltrami eigenvalues .",
    "this method was used to demonstrate that the ball is the minimizer for a variety of shape optimization problems .",
    "the author also studies the problem of maximizing the first five wentzell eigenvalues subject to a volume constraint , for which is a special case .",
    "shape optimization problems for steklov eigenvalues with mixed boundary conditions have also been studied @xcite .",
    "we consider the steklov eigenvalue problem   where the domain @xmath12 is simply - connected with smooth boundary @xmath4 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath4 possesses a @xmath53-periodic counterclockwise parametric representation of the form @xmath54 use of integral equation methods for leads directly upon discretization to a matrix eigenvalue problem @xcite . in order to avoid the inclusion of hypersingular operators we use eigenfunction representations based on a single layer potential .",

    "see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.41 ) for the proof that the corresponding boundary operator is bijective .",
    "taking into account well - known expressions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) for the jump of the single layer potential and its normal derivative across @xmath4 , the eigenvalue problem   reduces to the integral eigenvalue equation for @xmath60 , @xmath61 = \\lambda b[\\varphi].\\ ] ] here , the boundary operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 are defined @xmath64(x ) & : =   \\int_{\\partial \\omega } \\frac{\\partial\\phi(x - y)}{\\partial n(x)}(\\varphi(y ) - \\overline{\\varphi } ) ds(y ) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\varphi(x ) - \\overline{\\varphi})\\\\ b[\\varphi](x ) & : = \\lambda\\left(\\int_{\\partial \\omega } \\phi ( x - y)(\\varphi(y ) - \\overline{\\varphi } ) ds(y)+ \\overline{\\varphi } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the cases considered in this paper , the steklov eigenfunctions @xmath65 and the corresponding densities @xmath66 are smooth functions .",
    "these problems can thus be treated using highly effective spectrally - accurate methods  @xcite based on explicit resolution of logarithmic singularities and a fourier series approximation of the density . to construct a spectral method for approximation of the integral operators in",
    ", we use a nystrm discretization of the explicitly parametrized boundary @xmath4 .",
    "this spectral approximation of the integral equation system yields a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem of the form @xmath67 which can be solved numerically by means of the qz - algorithm ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the gradient of a simple eigenvalue is provided in proposition  [ prop : eigperpformula ] . while steklov eigenvalues are not differentiable when they have multiplicity greater than one , in practice , eigenvalues computed numerically that approximate the steklov eigenvalues of a domain are always simple .",
    "this is due to discretization error and finite precision in the domain representation .",
    "thus , we are faced with the problem of maximizing a function that we know to be non - smooth , but whose gradient is well - defined at points in which we sample .    to compute solutions to the eigenvalue optimization problem , we ( trivially ) reformulate the problem as a minimax problem , @xmath83 this minimax problem can be numerically solved using matlab s ` fminimax ` function which further reformulates the optimization problem @xmath84 and solves this problem using nonlinear constrained optimization methods .",
