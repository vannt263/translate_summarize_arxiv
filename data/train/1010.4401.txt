    "the argo - ybj experiment , located at the yangbajing cosmic ray laboratory ( tibet , p.r .",
    "china , 4300 m a.s.l . , 606 g/@xmath0 ) , is the only air shower array exploiting the full - coverage approach at very high altitude currently at work .",
    "argo - ybj is a multipurpose detector which faces a wide range of fundamental issues in cosmic ray and astroparticle physics with a low energy threshold ( a few hundred gev ) .",
    "the apparatus is constituted by a central carpet @xmath174@xmath2 78 m@xmath3 , made of a single layer of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) with @xmath193@xmath4 of active area , enclosed by a guard ring partially instrumented ( @xmath120@xmath4 ) up to @xmath1100@xmath2110 m@xmath3 .",
    "the apparatus has a modular structure , the basic data acquisition element being a cluster ( 5.7@xmath27.6 m@xmath3 ) , made of 12 rpcs ( 2.8@xmath21.25 m@xmath3 each ) .",
    "each chamber is read by 80 external strips of 6.75@xmath261.8 @xmath0 ( the spatial pixels ) , logically organized in 10 independent pads of 55.6@xmath261.8 @xmath0 which represent the time pixels of the detector . the read - out of 18360 pads and 146880 strips",
    "are the experimental output of the detector ( aielli g. et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "the rpcs are operated in streamer mode by using a gas mixture ( ar 15% , isobutane 10% , tetrafluoroethane 75% ) for high altitude operation .",
    "the high voltage settled at 7.2 kv ensures an overall efficiency of about 96% ( aielli g. et al . , 2009a ) .",
    "the full detector is composed of 153 clusters for a total active surface of @xmath16700 m@xmath3 .",
    "the detector is connected to two different data acquisition systems , working independently , and corresponding to the two operation modes , shower and scaler . in shower mode , for each event the location and timing of every detected particle is recorded , allowing the reconstruction of the lateral distribution and the arrival direction ( di sciascio g. et al . , 2007 ) . in scaler mode the total counts on each cluster are measured every 0.5 s , with limited information on both the space distribution and arrival direction of the detected particles , in order to lower the energy threshold down to @xmath11 gev ( aielli g. et al . , 2008 , 2009b , 2009c ) .",
    "since november 2007 the detector is in stable data taking with a multiplicity trigger n@xmath520 and a duty cycle @xmath6 : the trigger rate is about 3.6 khz . in this paper",
    "we report the main results in gamma - ray astronomy and cosmic ray physics after about 3 years of operations .",
    "= 5.5 cm    = 4.cm      the performance of the detector and the operation stability are continuously monitored by observing the moon shadow , i.e. , the deficit of cosmic rays ( cr ) detected in its direction .",
    "indeed , the size of the deficit allows the measurement of the angular resolution and its position allows the evaluation of the absolute pointing accuracy of the detector .",
    "in addition , positively charged particles are deflected towards east due to the geomagnetic field by an angle @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the observation of the displacement of the moon provides a direct calibration of the relation between shower size and primary energy .    on the left side of fig.[fig : moon1 ]",
    "a significance map of the moon region is shown . with all data from july 2006 to december 2009 ( about 3200 hours on - source in total ) we observed the cr moon shadowing effect with a significance of about 55 standard deviations ( s.d . ) .",
    "the measured angular resolution is better than 0.5@xmath8 for showers with energies e @xmath9 5 tev and the overall absolute pointing accuracy is at a level of @xmath10.1@xmath8 .",
    "the energy scale error of argo - ybj is estimated to be less than 18% in the energy range 1 - 30 tev / z .",
    "on the right side of fig.[fig : moon1 ] the ratio of the observed deficit count to the expected one evaluated on a monthly basis is shown as a function of the observation time for events with n@xmath9100 .",
    "the amount of cr deficit provides a good measure of the size of the shadow , therefore of the angular resolution .",
    "the resulting stability of the event deficit is at a level of 10% in the period november 2007 - march 2010 .",
    "= 4.5 cm    = 4.5 cm    with about 2 years of data we observed 3 sources with a significance greater than 5 s.d . : crab nebula , mrk421 and mgro j1908 + 06 .",
    "we observed the crab signal with a significance of 14 s.d . in about 800 days at a median energy of @xmath12 tev , without any event selection or gamma / hadron discrimination algorithm . in fig.[fig : crab08 ] the energy spectrum of the crab nebula measured by the argo - ybj experiment is compared to other observations .",
    "the data can be parameterized with the formula : dn / de = ( 4.1@xmath100.6)@xmath1110@xmath12 ( e/1 tev)@xmath13 @xmath14 s@xmath15 tev@xmath15 .",
    "our result is in good agreement with other experiments .",
    "mrk421 was the first source detected by the argo - ybj experiment in july 2006 when the detector started recording data with only the central carpet and was in commissioning phase . in the last 2 years we observed the blazar mrk421 with a total significance of about 12 s.d .",
    ", averaging over quiet and active periods .",
    "indeed , as it is well known , this agn is characterized by a strong flaring activity both in x - rays and in tev @xmath16-rays .",
    "argo - ybj detected different tev flares in correlation with x - ray observations , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : mrk421_cumul ] where the argo - ybj cumulative events per day is compared with the cumulative events per second of the rxte / asm and swift satellites . to get simultaneous data ,",
    "556 days have been selected for this analysis .",
    "the x - ray / tev correlation is quite evident over more than 2 years .",
    "the steepness of the curve gives the flux variation , therefore we observed an active period at the beginning of 2008 followed by a quiet phase .",
    "= 4.8 cm    = 4.8 cm    cross - correlation functions were measured to quantify the degree of correlation and the phase difference ( time lag ) between the variations in x - ray and tev bands , using the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) of edelson & krolik ( 1998 ) .",
    "the dcf gives the linear correlation coefficient for two light curves as a function of the time lag between them .",
    "for x - rays we consider two different bands ( 2 - 12 and 9 - 15 kev ) .",
    "the distributions peak around zero and the correlation coefficients around zero are @xmath10.78 .",
    "the peak positions , evaluated by fitting the distributions with a gaussian function around the maximum , are -0.14@xmath17 and -0.94@xmath18 days for rxte / asm and swift data , respectively .",
    "therefore , no significant time lag is found between x - ray data and tev argo - ybj observations .    in order to study the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of mrk421 at different flux levels",
    ", both x - ray and tev data have been divided into 4 bands based on the rxte / asm counting rate : 0 - 2 , 2 - 3 , 3 - 5 , @xmath95 @xmath14s@xmath15 . for each band",
    "a sed with the average flux is calculated for different x - ray and @xmath16-ray energies .",
    "the rxte / asm detector is monitoring mrk421 in three energy bands : 1.5 - 3 , 3 - 5 and 5 - 12 kev . by assuming a power - law x - ray energy spectrum we calculated the spectral indices in the 4 flux bands : -2.02@xmath100.08 , -2.05@xmath100.03 , -2.15@xmath100.03 and -2.43@xmath100.04 .",
    "a correlation is clearly recognized in the sense that higher fluxes are accompanied by harder energy spectra .",
    "this result , obtained by averaging the mrk421 emission over about 2 years , extends similar conclusions obtained by averaging observations over much shorter periods ( rebillot p.f .",
    "et al . , 2006 ) .    with this information we studied the relation between tev spectral index and flux .",
    "the tev flux measured by argo - ybj in the different bands ranges from 0.9 to about 7 crab units . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrk421-spindex ] the tev spectral index hardens with increasing flux in agreement with the results obtained by the whipple collaboration in 2002 ( continuous line ) ( krennrich f. et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "this conclusion generalizes our result obtained with the analysis of the june 2008 flare ( aielli g. et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "we investigated also the correlation between rxte / asm x - ray and argo - ybj tev fluxes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mrk421-quadratic ] ) .",
    "a positive correlation is clearly observed and the x - ray / tev relation seems to be quadratic rather than linear , in agreement with the results of fossati g. et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "mgro j1908 + 06 is a pulsar wind nebula discovered by milagro at a median energy of @xmath120 tev .",
    "later , the cherenkov telescopes hess and veritas confirmed this observation .",
    "the milagro and hess energy spectra are in disagreement ( smith a.j .",
    "et al . 2009 ) probably due to the intrinsic extension of the source .",
    "argo - ybj observed a tev emission from mgro j1908 + 06 with a significance of 6 s.d . in about 800 days .",
    "we estimated its intrinsic extension in 0.48@xmath100.28 deg , in agreement with the hess determination . with this information we calculated a preliminary energy spectrum : dn / de = ( 3.6@xmath100.8)@xmath1110@xmath19(e/6 tev)@xmath20 @xmath14 s@xmath15 tev@xmath15 in the energy range 1 - 30 tev .",
    "this spectrum is consistent with that measured by milagro , in particular around 10 tev , but is not consistent with the hess calculation .",
    "the argo - ybj data are not yet sensitive to the presence of an energy cutoff .",
    "= 5.8 cm    = 5.8 cm    fig . [ fig : medium_anisot ] shows the sky map for events with n@xmath940 and zenith angle @xmath21 ( corresponding to a proton median energy @xmath12 tev ) , obtained with a 5@xmath8 smoothing radius . the analysis has been performed in order to be insensitive to the cr large scale anisotropy which is roughly one order of magnitude greater .",
    "the map clearly shows two large hot spots in the region of the galactic anticenter .",
    "the two excesses ( @xmath910 s.d . , corresponding to a flux increase of @xmath10.1% ) are observed by argo - ybj around the positions @xmath22 120@xmath8 , @xmath23 40@xmath8 and @xmath22 60@xmath8 , @xmath23 -5@xmath8 , in agreement with a similar detection reported by the milagro collaboration ( abdo a.a .",
    "et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "however , the maximum of the second excess is slightly shifted towards lower declinations , probably because argo - ybj can observe the southern regions of the sky with more efficiency , being located at a lower latitude than milagro .",
    "the deficit regions parallel to the excesses are due to a known effect of the analysis , that uses also the excess events to evaluate the background , artificially increasing the background . the origin of this medium - scale anisotropy is puzzling .",
    "in fact , these regions have been interpreted as excesses of hadronic crs , but tev crs are expected to be randomized by the magnetic fields . understanding these anisotropies should be a high priority as they are probably due to a nearby source of crs , as suggested by some authors ( e.g. , markov m.a .",
    "et al . , 2010 ) .    with 2 years of data we carried out a 2d measurement to investigate the detailed structural information of the large scale cr anisotropy beyond the simple right ascension ( r.a",
    ") profiles .",
    "the so - called _ ` tail - in ' _ and _ ` loss - cone ' _ regions , correlated to an enhancement or deficit of crs , are clearly visible with a significance of about 20 s.d .",

    "the value of the spectral index of the power - law fit representing the argo - ybj data is -2.61@xmath100.04 , which should be compared to @xmath29 = -2.66@xmath100.02 and @xmath30 = -2.58@xmath100.02 obtained by cream .",
    "the present analysis does not allow the determination of the individual proton and helium contribution to the measured flux , but the argo - ybj data are mainly induced by protons since the average energy of helium primaries contributing to events with a given multiplicity is about 1.5 - 2 times greater than the average proton energy .",
    "this result suggests a possible hardening of the proton spectrum at energies @xmath95 tev with respect to that obtained at lower energies from direct measurements with satellites and balloon - borne detectors .",
    "we emphasize that for the first time direct and ground - based measurements overlap for a wide energy range thus making possible the cross - calibration of the different experimental techniques .      in order to measure the @xmath31 ratio at tev energies we exploit the earth - moon system as an ion spectrometer :",

    "if the energy is low enough and the angular resolution small we can distinguish , in principle , between two shadows , one shifted towards west due to the protons and the other shifted towards east due to the antiprotons . if no event deficit is observed on the antimatter side an upper limit on the antiproton content can be calculated .",
