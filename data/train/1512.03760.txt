    "an emblematic example of the spatiotemporal collective properties that can arise in `` complex systems '' is provided by the phenomenon of synchronization .",
    "such emergent behavior can be found in many real world systems , e.g. , laser arrays , pacemaker heart cells , circadian rhythms , flashing fireflies , amongst many others  @xcite .",
    "simple models that capture the essential features of the synchronization phenomenon  @xcite are coupled map lattices ( cmls ) .",
    "moreover , they are useful to model systems of scientific and technological interest as diverse as josephson junction arrays , multimode lasers , vortex dynamics , even evolutionary biology  @xcite , and also constitute good prototypes to investigate control of chaos .    traditionally ,",
    "when studying emergent patterns in cmls , the update of the constituent units is made synchronously ( parallel updating ) , meanwhile , the elements in real arrays are not perfectly synchronous .",
    "this issue is particularly important , for example , in biological neural networks  @xcite , but , more generally , when modeling real systems in diverse contexts , it seems more adequate to take into account some kind of asynchronicity .",
    "this choice is crucial , with important consequences on the final collective states  @xcite .",
    "for instance , asynchronous updating may open windows in parameter space where synchronization becomes allowed  @xcite and induce regularity in coupled systems in contrast to a synchronous updating  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the introduction of time delays , to account for finite delays in information transmission between units  @xcite , has also a noticeable impact on the collective patterns , e.g. , although synchronization is still possible , chaos is suppressed  @xcite .",
    "another realistic ingredient in modeling extended systems , within the spatial domain , is the coupling range . as a matter of fact",
    ", the range of the interactions plays a crucial role in the determination of the emergent patterns in any extended system  @xcite . insofar as the range of the interactions can affect the propagation of information , it is important to explore its interplay with the updating scheme .",
    "asynchronous updating , as well as time - delayed interactions , seem natural choices for a realistic modeling of coupled systems , but the correspondence between both descriptions has not been investigated yet . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate , through numerical and analytical tools , that the complete synchronization of a cml with asynchronous updating can be emulated by a delayed dynamics . additionally , through the range of the interactions , we will show the interplay of the temporal and spatial dimensions .",
    "we will derive analytical conditions for complete synchronization valid for a large class of cmls and local dynamics .",
    "we consider an array of @xmath0 elements with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the coupled elements evolve according to the mapping @xmath1 for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 describes the state of element @xmath4 , whose local dynamics is governed by the chaotic map @xmath5 .",
    "this is a fully connected array where elements interact , through a coupling also given by @xmath6 , with intensity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the integer inter - element distance over the ring .",

    "this coupling scheme allows to scan continuously from global ( @xmath16 ) to nearest - neighbor ( @xmath17 ) interactions . additionally , in numerical simulations",
    ", we will use , as paradigmatic example , the logistic map @xmath18",
    ". however , the analytical expressions that we will derive are valid for generic @xmath7 and chaotic unimodal maps @xmath5 .    in the usual synchronous evolution , all the @xmath0 new states ( at discrete time @xmath19 ) are computed in parallel from the @xmath0 previous values ( at time @xmath20 ) , that is , all the sites are updated simultaneously .",
    "alternatively , we will also investigate the asynchronous ( i.e. , random sequential ) evolution , where the updates are not simultaneous .",
    "finally , we will consider also time - delayed evolutions of the array , by introducing random or fixed delays in eq .",

    "we monitor the collective behavior by means of the instantaneous mean field @xmath21 defined as  @xcite @xmath22 and use the time average , @xmath23 , of its instantaneous standard deviation @xmath24 to measure the degree of synchronization .",
    "when @xmath25 , it means that the system is completely synchronized ( cs ) , i.e , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 can evolve in a chaotic or in a regular trajectory .",
    "another relevant parameter , that allows to characterize the chaoticity of a dynamical system , is the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath28 is positive , the system displays a chaotic behavior , while if it is negative , the dynamics is in a regular regime .",

    "a question is whether that in - equivalence arises due to the discrete nature of time delays .",
    "since the states are accessible at discrete times only , a way to emulate continuous time delays in the real interval @xmath93 $ ] is by interpolation between the states at @xmath94 and @xmath87 , as if the trajectory were continuous by parts .",

    "the outcomes put into evidence the interplay between the spatial and temporal dimensions in pattern formation , and also have implications in control of chaos , as far as we found a time delayed scheme more efficient than discrete delays in the stabilization of a locally unstable state , which can be understood along the lines discussed at the end of sec .",
