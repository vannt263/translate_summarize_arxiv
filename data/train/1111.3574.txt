    "2000 ; hring & rix 2004 ) . if black holes grow principally by radiatively efficient accretion , then the statistics of quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can be used to track the growth of the black hole population . one common approach to modeling this growth uses the black hole `` continuity equation '' ( cavaliere et al .",
    "1971 ; small & blandford 1992 ) . simple versions of such models have two free parameters : the radiative efficiency @xmath0 , which relates mass accretion rate to luminosity , and the eddington ratio @xmath6 , which relates luminosity to black hole mass . with the simplifying assumption that all active black holes have the same fixed values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and that each black hole has a duty cycle ( i.e. , a probability of being active at a given time ) that depends on mass and redshift , @xmath7",
    ", one can use the observed agn luminosity function to infer the average rate at which mass is being added to each mass range of the black hole population , thus evolving the black hole mass function forward in time .",
    "model assumptions can be tested by comparing to observational estimates of the local ( @xmath8 ) black hole mass function ( e.g. , salucci et al . 1998",
    "; marconi et al .  2004 ; shankar et al .  2004 ; shankar , weinberg & miralda - escud 2009 , hereafter swm ) .    the models presented in swm made use of this simplifying assumption of fixed values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our key findings were _",
    "( i ) _ that models with @xmath9 and @xmath10 yield a reasonable match to the local black hole mass function , though these specific inferred parameter values are sensitive to remaining uncertainties in the bolometric agn luminosity function , and _",
    "( ii ) _ that reproducing the observed luminosity function with these models required `` downsizing '' evolution , with the duty cycle for high mass black holes declining more rapidly with time than the duty cycle for low mass black holes .",
    "additional constraints on duty cycles ( apart from their relation to the fraction of active galaxies ) can be inferred from agn and quasar clustering ( haiman & hui 2001 ; martini & weinberg 2001 ) , although these constraints depend on the assumed level of scatter between agn luminosity and the mass of the host dark matter halo . reproducing the strong observed clustering of @xmath11 quasars ( shen et al .",
    "2007 ) requires duty cycles close to one and minimal scatter between luminosity and halo mass ( white , martini & cohn 2008 ; shankar et al .",

    "( 2009 ) requires significant scatter ( @xmath13dex ) between luminosity and halo mass to lower the predicted clustering amplitude ( shankar , weinberg & shen 2010c ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider more general continuity - equation models than those in swm , incorporating a distribution of eddington ratios @xmath5 , as well as allowing for possible redshift evolution or black hole mass dependence of characteristic @xmath1 values or average radiative efficiency .",
    "the motivation for these more general models is to make contact with a broader range of observations that offer additional constraints on agn and black hole evolution .",
    "most obviously , many authors have now used black hole masses inferred from linewidth measurements or host galaxy properties to directly estimate eddington ratios , finding evidence for broad @xmath5  distributions that change with redshift and black hole mass ( see section  [ subsec|comparewithobservedpl ] below for observational references ) .",
    "active galaxy fractions provide another set of important constraints on models . in single-@xmath1 models the duty cycle",
    "@xmath7   the fraction of black holes of mass @xmath14 at redshift @xmath15 that are active at a given time  follows simply from the ratio of the observed luminosity function to the calculated black hole mass function ( see swm ) . with a broad @xmath5 , the definition of duty cycle depends on the adopted threshold in luminosity or eddington ratio , and because observational samples inevitably include these thresholds , the observed active galaxy fraction also tests models of @xmath5 .",
    "other authors have recently implemented continuity equation models with broad eddington ratio distributions ( merloni & heinz 2008 ; yu & lu 2008 ; cao 2010 ) , but their studies are limited to a few specific models .",
    "our implementation here draws on some of the techniques introduced by cao ( 2010 ) and also on techniques and ideas from steed & weinberg ( 2003 ) , who attempted a broad - ranging study of black hole evolution within a general continuity equation framework .",
    "the broad @xmath5  models described here also provide a more general framework for modeling quasar and agn clustering , a topic we will examine in future work .",
    "phenomenological models of the black hole population like those in this paper complement models based on hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ) or semi - analytic models that tie quasar activity to major mergers of galaxies or dark matter halos ( e.g. , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; hopkins et al . 2006 ) .",

    "this complexity reflects the growing richness of the observational data , especially the measurements of eddington ratio distributions and active galaxy fractions over a wide range of redshift , mass , and luminosity , from a variety of data sets . in order of decreasing robustness ,",
    "our key qualitative conclusions are ( a ) that the characteristic eddington ratio @xmath4 declines at low redshift , ( b ) that the @xmath5  distribution broadens at low redshift , ( c ) that more massive black holes have lower @xmath4 , and ( d ) that more massive black holes have higher radiative efficiency .    despite the flexibility of our models , and despite investigating many variants beyond those discussed in the paper , we have not found a model that fully reproduces all of the observational constraints we have considered .",
    "the remaining discrepancies presumably reflect some combination of inadequate models and systematic errors in the data sets , as discussed in detail in section  [ sec|discu ] . on the model side ,",
    "we have assumed restricted functional forms for the mass and redshift dependence of @xmath5 , and more general behavior or sharper evolutionary transitions may be required to match the data .",
    "observationally , estimates of black hole masses and bolometric luminosities are both subject to systematic uncertainties , and even when these estimates are correct in the mean , scatter can have important effects on inferred trends and distributions .",
    "many of the tensions between the models and the data and among the data sets themselves revolve around the seemingly disparate trends found for optically luminous , broad - line quasars and varieties of low luminosity , type ii agn .",
    "we have followed standard practice in relating these two populations by a simple obscuration factor , but a more nuanced relation between the different categories of active black holes ( e.g. , trump et al .",
    "2011 ) may be crucial to resolving some of the tensions highlighted here .",
    "continuity - equation models draw on the inevitable link between luminosity and mass accretion to tie the observable population of agn to the evolving population of supermassive black holes that power them .",
    "they provide a powerful framework for linking empirical studies that probe a variety of observables across a wide span of redshift , luminosity , and black hole mass . as these empirical studies continue to improve in precision , dynamic range , and control of systematic uncertainties",
    ", they will refine the models into a tightly constrained history of the cosmic black hole population .",
