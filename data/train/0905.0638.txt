    "intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) are of interest in a variety of astrophysical contexts ( see , e.g. , the reviews by van der marel 2004 ; miller & colbert 2004 ) . especially the possible presence of imbhs in the centers of globular clusters has intrigued astronomers for decades ( e.g. , bahcall & wolf 1976 ) .",
    "this subject area underwent a considerable resurgence in recent years due to a combination of two advances .",
    "first , theoretical modeling suggested plausible formation scenarios for imbhs in the centers of globular clusters from realistic initial conditions ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) .",
    "second , the quality of observational data sets , especially those obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , advanced to the point where it is possible to measure velocity dispersions at a spatial resolution comparable to the sphere of influence size for plausible imbh masses .",
    "this led to the identification of three globular clusters with candidate imbhs , namely m15 , g1 , and @xmath0 centauri .",
    "gerssen et al .  (",
    "2002 ) used line - of - sight velocity data for individual stars in the core - collapsed cluster m15 ( ngc 7078 ) to argue for the presence of @xmath17 in dark material near the center , possibly in the form of an imbh .",
    "dull et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2003a ) showed that this could be a plausible result of mass - segregation , and need not be an imbh .",
    "moreover , baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued that the observed steep brightness profile of m15 , typical of the class of core - collapsed clusters , is in fact not consistent with expectation for a relaxed distribution of stars around an imbh . ho , terashima , & okajima ( 2003 ) and bash et al .  (",
    "2008 ) failed to detect x - ray or radio emission coincident with the cluster center .",
    "this is not necessarily inconsistent with an imbh , since the accretion rate and/or the accretion efficiency are likely to be low .",
    "nonetheless , m15 does not appear to be as strong an imbh candidate as once thought .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2005 ) used the velocity dispersion measured from integrated light near the center of the m31 cluster g1 to argue for the presence of a @xmath18 dark mass at the cluster center .",
    "the relaxation time of g1 is too long to have produced such a concentration of dark mass due to mass segregation .",
    "therefore , this result was taken as evidence of for the presence of an imbh .",
    "baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2003b ) disagreed with this interpretation , and argued that models with no dark mass ( imbh or otherwise ) provided an equally acceptable fit .",
    "the crux of this disagreement lies in the extremely small size of the sphere of influence ( @xmath19 ) of the putative imbh , which is less than the spatial resolution of the observations . phrased differently",
    ", the imbh induces only a small signature in the data . as a result",
    ", the interpretation of the data is sensitive to the exact details of the data - model comparison .",
    "the statistical significance of the imbh detection is not high , especially if one takes into account the possibility of `` black hole bias '' ( discussed later in section  [ ss : imbh ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", the possible presence of an imbh in g1 recently gained further credence with the detection of weak x - ray and radio emission from near the cluster center ( pooley & rappaport 2006 ; kong 2007 ; ulvestad , greene & ho 2007 ) .",
    "the emission properties are consistent with accretion onto an imbh , but other explanations can not be ruled out .",
    "noyola et al .",
    "( 2008 ; hereafter ngb08 ) argued for the presence of an imbh in the center of the cluster @xmath0 centauri ( ngc 5139 ) , which is well known for its many enigmatic properties ( e.g. , meylan 2002 ) . the dynamics of this cluster were studied previously by van de ven et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter vdv06 ) using sophisticated axisymmetric models . however , there was insufficient kinematical data at small radii to meaningfully constrain the possible presence of any dark mass .",
    "ngb08 performed integrated - light measurements of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion for two @xmath20 fields , one on the cluster center that they had determined , and one at @xmath21 from that center .",
    "they obtained @xmath22 and @xmath23 for these fields , respectively .",
    "the increase in @xmath24 towards the cluster center was interpreted to imply the presence of an imbh of mass @xmath25 .",
    "they also determined the surface brightness profile of @xmath0 centauri from hst images , and inferred a shallow central cusp of logarithmic slope @xmath26 .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical predictions for the cusp induced by an imbh ( baumgardt et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "both g1 and @xmath0 centauri are somewhat atypical globular clusters .",
    "they are the most massive clusters of their parent galaxies , m31 and the milky way , respectively .",
    "both clusters have been suggested to be the stripped nuclei of larger galaxies ( e.g. , freeman 1993 ; meylan et al .",
    "indeed , the nuclei of galaxies have very similar structural properties to globular clusters ( these nuclei are therefore also referred to as nuclear star clusters ; e.g. , walcher et al .",
    "accretion activity is known to exist in at least some of these nuclei ( e.g. , seth et al .",
    "so if g1 and @xmath0 centauri contain imbhs , then these may simply be the low - mass tail of the distribution of super - massive black holes known to exist in galactic nuclei .",
    "as such , they would not necessarily be telling us anything fundamentally new about the formation and evolution of globular clusters in general .",
    "nonetheless , g1 and @xmath0 centauri are probably the best current candidates for globular clusters with imbhs . validating",
    "the existence of their suggested imbhs is therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "the ( initial ) imbh evidence for m15 , g1 , and @xmath0 centauri was all based on studies of line - of - sight velocities .",
    "such studies are complicated because they require spectroscopy in regions of high stellar density .",
    "integrated - light measurements work well for a cluster as distant as g1 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 ) , but the downside is that the sphere of influence in such clusters is poorly resolved . in closer milky way clusters , the limited number of stars ( especially brighter ones ) introduces significant shot noise in integrated - light measurements . for @xmath0 centauri , this required special treatment of the data to counteract this ( ngb08 ) . for m15",
    ", hst / stis was used to obtain spectroscopy of individual stars ( van der marel et al .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise requirements for a velocity measurement limit the data set to the brightest stars . in turn",
    ", this sets the smallest radius inside which a velocity dispersion can be measured .",
    "a significant improvement in data quality is possible with proper motion measurements .",
    "such studies do not require much observing time and allow measurement even of the more numerous faint stars .",
    "moreover , the ratio of the velocity dispersions in the tangential and radial proper motion directions directly constrains the velocity - dispersion anisotropy of the system .",
    "this is important because of the well - known mass - anisotropy degeneracy for stellar systems ( binney & mamon 1982 ) . to determine accurate proper motions close to the center",
    "requires an observing platform with high spatial resolution and long - term stability .",
    "the hst provides such a platform .",
    "mcnamara , harrison , & anderson ( 2003 ) measured proper motions for m15 , which were modeled by van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and chakrabarty ( 2006 ) .",
    "this confirmed the presence of dark mass near the cluster center , but did not shed new light on the issue of whether this is due to mass segregation or an imbh .",
    "mclaughlin et al .  ( 2006 ) obtained and modeled proper motions for 47 tuc , and used these to set an upper limit of 1000@xmath27 on the mass of any imbh in that cluster .    in anderson & van",
    "der marel ( 2009 ; hereafter paper i ) we presented the results of a new observational hst study of @xmath0 centauri . for the central few arcmin of the cluster we determined the projected number density distribution of some @xmath28 stars , as well as accurate proper motions of some @xmath29 stars .",
    "the exact position of the cluster center was determined in three independent ways .",
    "first , we determined the center of the number density distribution using various methods , taking care to accurately account for incompleteness .",
    "second , we determined the kinematical center , being the symmetry point of the rms proper motion velocity field . and third ,",
    "we determined the center of unresolved light seen in 2mass data .",
    "all determinations agree to within 1@xmath30 , yielding a final estimate with an uncertainty of @xmath31 .",
    "the ngb08 center position , and hence the position of their central spectroscopic field , is at @xmath32 from the center determined in paper  i ( and coincidentally , the second off - center spectroscopic field they studied is also at @xmath32 ) .",
    "the differences between the centers determined in these two studies is likely due to a combination of subtle effects that biased the ngb08 analysis , as discussed in paper  i. as a result of this , the density cusp found by ngb08 was not measured around the actual cluster center . also , we showed in paper  i that their use of unresolved light ( as opposed to star counts ) increased the impact of shot noise . in paper",
    "i we determined the number density profile around the actual center of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "it was found to be well matched by a standard king model , even though a shallow cusp may not be ruled out .    in paper",
    "i we also determined the rms proper motions of stars detected in the same @xmath33 fields studied spectroscopically by ngb08 .",
    "for the canonical distance @xmath34 ( vdv06 ) , the results translate to one - dimensional values @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for their `` central '' and `` off - center '' fields respectively .",
    "so we did not confirm the ngb08 finding that one of their fields has a higher dispersion .",
    "the observation that there is no significant difference in proper motion dispersion between the two fields is consistent with our finding that they are both at the same radius @xmath32 from the actual cluster center .",
    "our results of paper  i did not confirm the arguments put forward by ngb08 to suspect the presence of an imbh in @xmath0 centauri .",
    "however , this does not mean that such an imbh may not be present after all .",
    "the size and quality of our proper motion data set are superb .",
    "this provides the opportunity to study the central dynamics of @xmath0 centauri at a level of detail that is unmatched by other clusters .",
    "we therefore present here a detailed study of the dynamics of @xmath0 centauri , with the primary goal of exploiting the new data from paper  i to constrain the mass of any possible imbh .",
    "we also include existing ground - based data in our data - model comparisons , to obtain the best possible results .",
    "we restrict our modeling efforts in the present paper to spherical models .",
    "this is a simplification , given that @xmath0 centauri is elongated and rotating ( in fact , unusually so for a globular cluster ) .",
    "however , both the elongation ( geyer , nelles , & hopp 1983 ) and the rotation rate ( vdv06 ) decrease towards the cluster center .",
    "therefore , the assumption of sphericity is likely to be reasonable in the central region most relevant for constraining an imbh .",
    "we find support for this throughout our paper by showing that spherical models yield an anisotropy profile , distance , and mass - to - light ratio that are in excellent agreement with the values obtained by vdv06 .",
    "more sophisticated models , such as those of the type described by vdv06 , van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and chaname et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , have the potential to constrain other aspects of the structure of @xmath0 centauri , such as its inclination , rotation properties , and the presence of any kinematic subcomponents",

    "the first ingredient generally causes a shallow gradient in @xmath52(r)$ ] over the scale of the entire cluster ( e.g. , gill et al .",
    "this has little effect on the model predictions in the area surrounding the very center , where we wish to search for the signature of an imbh .",

    ", we neglect mass segregation among the luminous stars . for @xmath0 centauri",
    "there are in fact several pieces of evidence that it has not yet undergone complete mass segregation , consistent with its long half - mass relaxation time of @xmath62 years ( mclaughlin & van der marel 2005 ) .",

    "he found that variations in the lfs are less than would be expected if mass segregation had proceeded to the point of energy equipartition . and fourth , in paper i we studied the proper motion dispersion of stars along the main sequence .",

    "the velocity distribution is close to isotropic near the center , but with some radial anisotropy .",
    "there is a significant increase in tangential anisotropy at a few core radii .",
    "the latter is mostly due to the contribution of rotation to the second moment @xmath133 .",
    "the anisotropy in the proper motion _",
    "dispersions _ is much less ( king & anderson 2002 ) .",
    "luminous stars in a cluster undergo two distinct effects as a result of two - body relaxation : mass segregation and energy equipartition .",
    "these effects are intimately connected through basic dynamical theory , but from an observational perspective it is useful to think of them as separate effects .",
    "mass segregation causes stars of different masses to have slightly different spatial distributions . in section  [",
    "s : modeling ] we assumed that this could be neglected when parameterizing the run of mass - to - light ratio with radius , and when connecting star count data at small radii to surface brightness data at large radii .",
    "this assumption was motivated by the absence of high - quality data to constrain the amount of mass segregation over the full scale of the cluster , and by the desire to minimize the number of a priori model assumptions .",
    "energy equipartition causes stars of low mass to move faster than those of high mass .",
    "we measured in paper  i that low - mass stars in @xmath0 centauri do indeed move faster than high - mass stars , albeit by less than would be predicted for complete energy equipartition ( @xmath279 ) .",
    "since we have a direct measurement of this , there is no reason to ignore this effect in the modeling .",
    "we therefore correct for it when comparing the observed kinematics from different data sets .",
    "the available discrete ground - based line - of - sight and proper motion data all pertain to relatively bright stars .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of these stars place them on the giant or sub - giant branch .",
    "since stellar evolution proceeds relatively rapidly after the main - sequence turn - off , these stars all have essentially the same mass as the main - sequence turn - off .",
    "by contrast , the stars in our new hst proper motion sample from paper  i ( discussed in detail in section  [ ss : hstkin ] below ) extend from about the main - sequence turn - off to @xmath280 magnitudes below that . from the analysis of paper  i it follows that the rms proper motion of stars at the average magnitude of the hst sample is @xmath281% higher than that at the main - sequence turn - off .    for a fair comparison to the new hst proper motion data",
    ", we took the kinematics from the discrete velocity studies in sections  [ sss : groundlos ] and  [ sss : groundpm ] and multiplied them by a factor @xmath282 .",
    "this implies that we use the observed ( sub-)giant star kinematics to estimate the kinematics of lower - mass stars in the same general population .",
    "we assume implicitly that the variation of rms kinematics with mass is the same everywhere in the cluster ( although it was only measured near the cluster center ) , and that it applies also in the line - of - sight direction ( although it was only measured in the proper motion direction ) . in reality",
    ", one would expect the relation between mass and velocity dispersion to change with radius , since relaxation proceeds faster near the cluster center than further out .",
    "this was neglected in the present context by applying the same small correction throughout the cluster .",
    "this was motivated in part by the fact that our study focuses mostly on the central part of the cluster anyway , but also by the fact that we did nt actually detect a difference in equipartition in paper  i between the different ( central and major axis ) fields for which we obtained proper motions .",
    "we did not apply the multiplicative correction to the ngb08 data .",
    "their measurements are based on integrated light , excluding the brightest regions in their fields .",
    "it is therefore not obvious that their measurements would be dominated by ( sub-)giant stars .",
    "either way , a @xmath283% correction would be much less than the error bars on their datapoints .    in summary , we are using our jeans models to fit the kinematics of stars with masses typical of our hst proper motion sample .",
    "we extend our actual hst kinematics to larger radii using ground - based kinematics that have been corrected to the same characteristic mass .",
    "we model the cluster density profile using hst star counts for a sample that is also centered on the same characteristic mass ( see section  [ ss : sbhst ] ) .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that there is no mass segregation among the luminous stars only so that we can extend the hst density profile to larger radii , where it can be tied to ground - based star - count data and integrated photometry that are based largely on giant stars ( see section  [ ss : sbground ] ) .",
    "since this approximation does not affect the very central region of the cluster , it should have little effect on our results for the central mass distribution .",
    "in fact , the multiplicative correction of @xmath282 discussed above also has little effect on this .",
    "we verified explicitly that none of the main conclusions of our paper change at a level that exceeds the formal uncertainties when the multiplicative correction is omitted .        in paper",
    "i we derived proper motions for stars observed in two fields observed by hst , a `` central field '' on the cluster center , and a `` major axis field '' positioned adjacent to it in non - overlapping fashion roughly along the cluster major axis . here",
    "we use the `` high - quality '' sample presented in paper  i , which contains the non - saturated stars that are isolated enough and bright enough ( @xmath204-band instrumental magnitude @xmath284 ) for a particularly reliable proper motion measurement .",
    "this sample has 53382 stars in the central field and 19593 stars in the major axis field . in this sample ,",
    "95.1% of the stars have proper motion errors below @xmath270 .",
    "our cut in proper motion accuracy is therefore not very different from that applied by vdv06 .",
    "however , the median proper motion error per coordinate in the final sample of vdv06 is @xmath285 , whereas it is a factor two smaller , @xmath286 , for our sample .",
    "we note that our use of only the high - quality sample is rather conservative .",
    "even the remainder of the sample of paper  i is quite accurate , and could well have been used to constrain the cluster dynamics .",
    "the central hst field covers radii @xmath287 , while the major axis field covers radii @xmath288 .",
    "the central field has complete position angle coverage out to @xmath289 ( the radius of the largest enclosed circle ) .",
    "for @xmath290 the coverage over the range of position angles becomes increasingly sparse .",
    "the major axis field is restricted at all radii to position angles within @xmath291 of the major axis . for the analysis of the present paper it is important to have coverage of all position angles at a given radius , so that average kinematical quantities over circular annuli can be calculated .",
    "for this reason we have used only the 25194 stars at @xmath292 to constrain the dynamical models .    in our analysis we ignore the 47781 stars with high - quality hst proper motions at radii @xmath293 .",
    "we do discuss relevant quantities derived from these data in appendix  c. more sophisticated axisymmetric modeling techniques ( such as those in vdv06 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "2006 ; and chaname , kleyna , & van der marel 2008 ) that might be applied in the future probably would not want to exclude these data in their analysis .",
    "by contrast , to include these data in our spherical models would require estimates of the ratios @xmath294 of the average of either @xmath132 or @xmath133 over a restricted range of position angles , to its average over a circle .",
    "we have experimented with such estimates , but concluded that the approximations that need to be made introduce sufficient uncertainties that these data do not really help to constrain our models .",
    "conversely , we have found no evidence that inclusion of the hst data at @xmath295 , combined with reasonable estimates for the ratios @xmath296 , would alter in any way the conclusions draw below ( see appendix  c ) .    to reject cluster non - members we created scatter plots of total two - dimensional proper motion @xmath297 versus radius @xmath39 , where @xmath298 is the proper motion vector of an individual star .",
    "such a plot reveals a sparse population of field stars at large values of @xmath297 , in addition to the numerous cluster stars at low @xmath299 .",
    "we rejected those stars from the sample that reside at @xmath300 and for which @xmath301 . at the radii for which we have hst proper motions , this equation is a good approximation to the escape velocity curve for a spherical model with a canonical distance and mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath34 , @xmath302 ; vdv06 ) . with this criterion ,",
    "only 27 non - member stars were identified at @xmath292 , the closest of which resides at @xmath303 . since the presence of an imbh may result in the presence of rapidly moving stars at small radii , we did not reject any stars at @xmath304 .",
    "the wings of the observed velocity distribution at small radii are discussed in detail in section  [ ss : isogh ] below .",
    "our final hst proper motion sample for the dynamical modeling consists of 25167 stars .",
    "this is a factor @xmath305 larger than the number of stars with proper motions in the vdv06 sample .",
    "most of their stars reside at larger radii than those sampled here . at the radii @xmath306 of our sample , vdv06 had only some two dozen stars with proper motions , and @xmath307 stars with line - of - sight velocities .",
    "the hst data therefore provide a major advance for constraining dynamical models , especially as it pertains to the gravitational influence of a possible imbh at small radii .      for each star in the hst sample we decomposed the observed proper motion vector @xmath298 into components in the pmr and pmt directions , respectively .",
    "we then binned the stars in radius and derived the profiles @xmath272 , @xmath273 , and @xmath308 .",
    "we did this in similar fashion as for the ground - based proper motion data discussed in section  [ sss : groundpm ] , using the statistical methodology described in appendix  a.    figure  [ f : kin]b shows the @xmath278 data as function of projected distance @xmath39 from the cluster center .",
    "the results match well with those from vdv06 in the region where the data sets overlap . for the individual data points of @xmath133 , @xmath132 and @xmath278 we used binning in annuli that are @xmath309 wide . for the central aperture we used a circle of radius @xmath310 , which gives an average radius @xmath311 for the datapoints enclosed by it . this central aperture is larger than the @xmath31 uncertainty in the position of the cluster center derived in paper  i.",
    "this uncertainty should therefore not significantly affect the inferred kinematics .",
    "the adopted binning gives acceptably small error bars in all apertures , without losing too much spatial resolution near the center .",
    "one immediate result from the inferred @xmath308 profile is that there is no strong increase towards the center , consistent with arguments presented in paper  i. a straight line fit to the @xmath312 data for @xmath313 , with @xmath248 , yields a slope of @xmath314 .",
    "the slopes inferred for other values of @xmath315 in the range @xmath251@xmath252 are statistically consistent with this .",
    "this analysis indicates that the central data points are consistent with a flat profile of rms velocity as function of radius .",
    "the error bars on the observed rms velocities can be reduced by increasing the amount of binning . for the ratio of @xmath277 shown in figure  [ f : kin]c we used binning in annuli of @xmath316 wide , so that even small deviations from isotropy can be measured .",
    "as for @xmath278 , the results match well with those from vdv06 in the region where the data sets overlap .",
    "the average over all hst data points is @xmath317 .",
    "hence , there is a very small , but significant , amount of radial anisotropy in the central arcminute of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "our data calibration of paper  i ( see discussion in section 3.6.4 of that paper ) removed by necessity any possible solid - body rotation component from the data .",
    "this is because we did not have access to stationary background sources in the hst fields , as would be required to measure absolute motions .",
    "this calibration has the advantage that it automatically removes any perspective rotation present in the actual proper motions ( however , this is negligible for the small radii @xmath306 sampled by our data anyway ; @xmath318 at the canonical @xmath215 ) .",
    "but of course , it has the disadvantage that it also removes a solid - body rotation fit to the actual rotation field of the cluster .",
    "this is a fundamental limitation of the data .",
    "however , we discuss below that this has only negligible importance for our models .    in paper",
    "i , we also used a `` local correction '' that removed all other mean systematic motions ( as opposed to random motions ) from the proper motion data .",
    "however , that was by choice , and not by necessity .",
    "the motivation for this is to calibrate out small time - variations in the higher - order geometric distortion terms .",
    "this improves the measurement of the random motions in the cluster .",
    "however , one would of course not want this to remove an important signal that is present in the data , and in particular , any possible differential rotation in the plane of the sky ( i.e. , the part of the rotation field that remains after subtraction of a solid - body fit ) .",
    "we tested for such differential rotation in paper  i , and found that it is negligible in the central hst field .",
    "proper motion rotation curves ( the mean tangential motion as function of radius ) derived from data with and without the local correction agree to within @xmath264 at all radii . therefore , solid - body rotation is the _ only _ unrepresented rotation component that could affect the modeling .    in principle",
    ", the loss of information on solid - body rotation can be partly recovered as in vdv06 .",
    "they use the fact that for an equilibrium axisymmetric system the equation @xmath319 \\",
    "> { \\cal v}_{\\rm y}\\ ] ] must hold everywhere on the projected plane of the sky . here",
    "@xmath320 is the inclination , @xmath321 the projected minor axis direction , and the symbol @xmath322 is used to distinguish a mean proper motion from a mean velocity @xmath202 .",
    "however , to use this equation with accuracy for our hst proper motions would require many more stars with line - of - sight velocities than are actually available at @xmath292 .",
    "the pmr direction is perpendicular to the direction of absolute rotation , and our estimates of @xmath132 are therefore not affected by our inability to measure absolute rotation .",
    "also , in an equilibrium system there can not be mean streaming in the pmr direction , when averaged along a circle",
    ". however , our calculated values of @xmath323 will be systematically low by a multiplicative factor @xmath324 , because we are unable to include any actual solid - body contribution from @xmath325 .",
    "the proper motion data presented by vdv06 _ did _ include measurements of absolute rotations in the plane of the sky .",
    "figure  [ f : vsig ] shows for their data the ratios @xmath326 and @xmath327 , where the quantities in the nominator and denominator are all averages over an annulus .",
    "these measurements allow us to estimate the value of @xmath328 for the hst data .",
    "the central data point shows explicitly that there is very little rotation in @xmath0 centauri at the radii of our central hst field .",
    "more generally , in the central 10 arcmin , the rotation rate is approximately linear with radius , @xmath329 .",
    "therefore , @xmath330^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "these approximations are shown as solid lines in the figure .",
    "this approximation implies that @xmath331 for the radii @xmath292 pertaining to the hst sample .",
    "given what is already known about proper motion rotation from the vdv06 data , our estimates of @xmath133 should be quite accurate .",
    "this is despite the fact that any solid - body part of the @xmath332 field can not be measured directly in the hst data . in particular , the value of @xmath328 is insufficient to explain the observed anisotropy @xmath317 .",
    "also , the data of vdv06 show that @xmath333 is about a factor two lower than @xmath326 .",
    "hence , the influence of rotation is even more negligible for the line - of - sight measurements at @xmath32 of ngb08 ( see discussion in section  [ sss : groundlos ] ) .",
    "=    =    = 0.8    = 0.8      to analyze the shapes of the hst proper motion distributions we binned the data in concentric circular annuli as in section  [ sss : hstrms ] . for each bin",
    "we created separate histograms of the proper motions in the pmt and pmr directions .",
    "we used bins that correspond to @xmath264 for the canonical distance of @xmath0 centauri ( @xmath215 ; vdv06 ) . for each histogram we calculated the best - fitting gaussian and the corresponding gauss - hermite moments , as in van der marel et al .",
    "the odd moments are zero for distributions that are averaged over circles .",
    "figure  [ f : gh ] shows the lowest order non - trivial even gauss - hermite moments @xmath174 and @xmath334 .",
    "these were calculated for annuli that are @xmath316 wide .",
    "the average values over all radii @xmath335 are @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 , @xmath339 .",
    "the 8th and 10th order moments were also calculated , but are not shown here .",
    "they were found to be consistent with zero , like @xmath334 .",
    "for all moments , the values for the pmr and pmt directions were found to be consistent within the errors .",
    "the only moment that is non - zero is @xmath174 , with an average value over the two proper motion directions of @xmath340 .",
    "this is indicative of proper motion distributions that are slightly more flat - topped than a gaussian , and have slightly less extended wings .",
    "we will compare this to model predictions in section  [ ss : isogh ] .",
    "the observed profile of @xmath341 shows statistically significant deviations from unity , both at small and at large radii ( see figure  [ f : kin]c ) .",
    "it is therefore important to allow for anisotropy in our models for @xmath0 centauri .    to illustrate the relation between the model anisotropy function @xmath88 and the observed quantity @xmath342",

    "it provides an excellent fit .",
    "the predictions shown in the figure were calculated for core models with no dark mass .",
    "however , the predicted ratio @xmath342 depends mostly on @xmath88 , and is virtually indistinguishable when considering instead models with a cusp or dark mass .",
    "the error bars of the fit show that velocity anisotropy is detected at high statistical significance in @xmath0 centauri .",
    "the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 imply that the ratio @xmath356 transitions from @xmath357 near the center to @xmath358 at large radii .",
    "these are of course not necessarily the values at the very center and at infinity , since our model is constrained by proper motion data only over the range @xmath359@xmath360 arcsec . either way , there is a transition from radial anisotropy at small radii to tangential anisotropy at large radii .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 indicates that the transition occurs at approximately @xmath361 arcmin ( @xmath362 core radii ) .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the modeling results of vdv06 .",
    "they found ( their section  9.2 ) that @xmath0 centauri is slightly radially anisotropic for @xmath363 arcmin and that it becomes increasingly tangentially anisotropic outside this region .",
    "the centers of globular clusters are generally believed to have isotropic velocity distributions because two - body relaxation tends to isotropize the orbits .",

    "since full energy equipartition has not yet been achieved , it is not surprising that complete velocity isotropy has not yet been achieved either .",
    "a sufficient number of stars is necessary to measure the proper motion anisotropy with accuracy . due to the finite number of stars at small radii ,",
    "the anisotropy is not as well constrained at radii @xmath364 as it is further out .",

    "one consequence of this is that the projected kinematics predicted near the center are influenced primarily by the anisotropy at larger radii .",
    "changing the model anisotropy in the central @xmath365 even quite substantially ( e.g. , @xmath366% in @xmath367 ) does not change the model predictions for the hst proper motion kinematics by more than a fraction of the error bars , even for the innermost data point .",

    "the core and cusp models generally predict the same dynamics at large radii , but differ slightly at small radii .",
    "it is true in many analytical models with a cusped density profile and no central dark mass that the projected rms velocity decreases towards the center ( e.g. , tremaine et al .",
    "the same can be seen in figure  [ f : rmsfit]b for our model with @xmath4 .",
    "even though the cusp is quite shallow in projection , this corresponds to a much steeper three - dimensional luminosity density @xmath373 at asymptotically small radii .",
    "similarly , the decrease in rms velocities towards the center is much stronger intrinsically in three - dimensions than it is in projection .",

    "we believe that this may be due to underestimates in the ngb08 error bars , since they did not explicitly include the contribution of shot noise ( from the finite number of stars ) to their error bars .",
    "similarly , the measurement in the vdv06 annulus at @xmath384 appears inconsistent with other measurements in that same data set .",
    "the weighted average of the two adjacent annuli is lower and inconsistent with it at the @xmath392 level .",
    "this suggests that both discrepant measurements that contribute disproportionately to @xmath149 may be spuriously high for unknown reasons .    evidently , there are some internal discrepancies in the datasets themselves .",
    "hence , the observed values of @xmath393 should not be taken as a sign of shortcomings in the models .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath393 are remarkably low , given that we are fitting kinematical data compiled from 10 different original sources .",
    "potential uncorrected systematics between different studies could easily have induced much larger data - model discrepancies .",

    "the inclusion of the imbh makes very little difference to the predictions .",

    "the inclusion of the imbh provides a small but visible improvement in the fit near the center .",
    "the reason that the imbh is more massive and significant in the cusp model is due to the dip in rms velocity predicted by these models when there is no dark mass .    in assessing the meaning of formal error bars on @xmath16 , it is important to keep in mind what one may call `` black hole bias '' .",
    "statistical error bar estimates take into account only the random gaussian uncertainties in the data .",
    "they do not take into account the systematic residuals that are inevitably present in any astronomical data - model comparison . in the present context",
    "these may include oversimplifications in the model assumptions ( e.g. , sphericity , equilibrium , the adopted density parameterization , no mass segregation among the luminous stars ) , the data reduction process ( e.g. , inability to measure absolute proper motion rotation ) , or the meaning of the data themselves ( e.g. , inability to separate orbital motion from potential binary motion ) . by adding @xmath16 as an extra free parameter to the fit , the model gains in ability to fit these systematic residuals that are not actually due to an imbh .",
    "because masses are positive definite ( @xmath407 ) , this generally tends to bias in the direction of invoking more mass then there actually is , as compared to the opposite .",
    "hence , @xmath16 tends to be biased high .",
    "marginally significant non - zero @xmath16 values with no tell - tale signs of an imbh ( e.g. , fast - moving stars or an @xmath408 increase in @xmath135 ) may simply be indications of small systematic issues in the data - model comparison unrelated to an imbh .",
    "the core model with no imbh fits the kinematical data a little better than the cusp model with an imbh ( see figure  [ f : parab ] ) .",
    "the difference is @xmath409 , which is nominally significant at the @xmath410 level .",

    "they are not easily captured in a single number without having to make arbitrary choices about , e.g. , what radii to include in the comparison .",
    "either way , when comparing both the photometric and kinematic information for the core and cusp models we feel that there is no sound statistical basis to prefer one model over the other . in view of this , we conclude that the existing data do not imply that an imbh is present in @xmath0 centauri",
    ". however , imbhs with masses @xmath10 can not be ruled out at @xmath14 confidence ( or @xmath412 at @xmath413 confidence ) .",
    "the best - fit distance and mass - to - light ratio depend only slightly on the particular model we adopt .",

    "they found that @xmath419 and @xmath420 .",
    "their modeling technique was considerably more sophisticated than ours , allowing for axisymmetry , inclination , ellipticity variations with radius , and arbitrary profiles of rotation and velocity - dispersion anisotropy .",
    "the reason that our error bars are smaller than theirs is likely a combination of two effects .",
    "first , we have considerably more data at our disposal than did vdv06 , and in particular we have a factor @xmath305 more stars with measured proper motions .",
    "this produces a significant decrease in the random uncertainties .",
    "but second , in our simpler models we can not explore the full variety of phase - space distributions that might fit the data with non - standard distances or mass - to - light ratios .",
    "therefore , we are not quantifying systematic errors as rigorously as vdv06 , and as a result our errors are artificially lowered compared to theirs .",
    "the fact that our @xmath49 and @xmath418 agree with those of vdv06 indicates that there is no reason to mistrust that our spherical models can address the central mass distribution of @xmath0 centauri with credible accuracy .",
    "this is further supported by the facts that both the elongation ( geyer , nelles , & hopp 1983 ) and the rotation rate ( section  [ sss : hstrot ] ) decrease towards the cluster center . to get good results we did have to make sure to model rms velocities ( which sum rotation velocities and velocity dispersions in quadrature ) and not merely velocity dispersions .",
    "also , one should fit only quantities that are properly averaged over annuli on the projected plane of the sky .",
    "if these things are not done , then biased estimates are obtained for @xmath49 and @xmath418 , as demonstrated in appendix  c of vdv06 .",
    "isotropic models predict that @xmath351 at all radii , so they are not generally appropriate for @xmath0 centauri",

    "we also show the predictions for @xmath5 , as well as for the value @xmath424 advocated by ngb08 .",
    "the ngb08 imbh mass was based on their measurement of @xmath425 at a position they believed to be the cluster center .",
    "this high imbh mass is now clearly ruled out , even for an isotropic model , for two reasons .",
    "first , paper  i showed that this measurement actually applies to a larger distance @xmath382 from the cluster center .",
    "the arrow in figure  [ f : rmsfit]c demonstrates how this moved the corresponding line - of - sight velocity measurement . and second , the high measured rms velocity was not confirmed by proper motion measurements , either at the same position or on the actual cluster center . note in figure  [ f : rmsfit]c that the isotropic model with the ngb08 imbh does appear to match well the data at @xmath426@xmath427 . however , it overpredicts the data at both @xmath428 and @xmath429@xmath365 .",
    "since all data points were derived in the same manner and are equally valid , there is no reason attribute more weight to the data at @xmath426@xmath427 . in particular ,",
    "the data at @xmath430 contain most of the information on the very central mass distribution , and they clearly rule out an imbh mass as high as advocated by ngb08 ( independent of the model anisotropy near the center ) .    it is evident from figure  [ f : parab ] that isotropic models require a higher imbh mass than the best - fit anisotropic models .",
    "this is not generally true for isotropic models , but is a specific consequence of the fact that @xmath0 centauri is radially anisotropic near the center and tangentially anisotropic at large radii .",
    "this affects the general gradient in rms velocity from small to large radii ( see e.g. , figures  10 and  11 of van der marel  1994 ) . the anisotropic model without a dark mass has a steeper gradient towards the center than the corresponding isotropic model .",
    "the anisotropic model therefore requires less dark mass to fit the observed gradient .",
    "this indicates that one should be careful in application of isotropic models to studies of imbhs .",
    "depending on the exact anisotropy of the cluster , the assumption of isotropy can lead to either an overestimated or an underestimated imbh mass , or it can require an imbh when none is present .",
    "=    =      when a dark mass is clearly required by the data , as in the case of isotropic models with a cusp , one can ask whether an extended dark cluster may provide a better fit than an imbh . figure  [ f : jeansbest ]",

    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath432 and @xmath433 .",
    "the predictions of this model are shown in figure  [ f : rmsfit]c .",
    "it has a somewhat shallower increase in rms velocity towards the center than the imbh model .",
    "the dark - cluster model makes an improvement of only @xmath434 over the imbh model , while increasing the number of free parameters by one .",
    "this is not statistically significant .",
    "therefore , one can interpret figure  [ f : jeansbest ] to mean that if there is a dark mass in @xmath0 centauri , then its extent must be @xmath435 at @xmath14 confidence .",
    "the central density of the best - fitting dark cluster is @xmath436 , according to equation  ( [ rhodark ] ) . using equation  ( [ radscale ] ) to transform angular units to physical units , this yields for the core model @xmath437 .",
    "the central density of luminous matter in this model is only @xmath438 .",

    "the required @xmath442 scales approximately linearly with @xmath441 .",
    "the ( maximum ) size @xmath60 of the dark mass fit is relatively insensitive to the exact anisotropy . either way",
    ", if @xmath0 centauri does indeed have a dark central cluster , this would be indicative of quite an extreme amount of mass segregation or a very top - heavy initial mass function .",
    "if a dark mass is invoked to explain the data , then an imbh may be easier to explain than such a concentrated dark cluster .      for our isotropic models we calculated the projected velocity distributions @xmath114 as described in section  [ ss : vp ] , and from this the gauss - hermite moments @xmath443 .",
    "we did not take the effect of observational proper motion uncertainties into account in the models ( essentially a convolution of the model predictions with the error distribution ) .",

    "fit the observed gauss - hermite moments within the error bars . over the range @xmath445 , the predicted gauss - hermite moments for these models are approximately constant . for the core model without dark mass they are @xmath446 and @xmath447 , and for the cusp model with an imbh they are @xmath448 and @xmath449",
    ". these averages do deviate in statistically significant manner from the observed averages , @xmath340 and @xmath9 ( see section  [ sss : hstgh ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising , given that we have already established that @xmath0 centauri does not have an isotropic velocity distribution , not even near its center .",
    "however , the differences between the predicted and the average observed gauss - hermite moments are quite small @xmath450 . for comparison , models that range in anisotropy from fully tangential to fully radial can easily span the range @xmath451 ( e.g. , van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "the measured gauss - hermite moments are therefore consistent with the fact that the velocity distribution is not far from isotropic near the center of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "the cusp model without dark mass does _ not _ fit the observed gauss - hermite moments . as discussed in section  [ ss : cuspcore ] , this model has a strong decrease in its intrinsic ( unprojected ) rms velocity towards the center .",
    "the decrease in the projected rms velocity is relatively mild , as shown in figure  [ f : rmsfit]c .",
    "however , there is a strong gradient in the rms velocity along the line of sight .",
    "this leads to strongly non - gaussian velocity distributions . in a central aperture of @xmath452 radius ,",
    "as used for the innermost observational data point in figure  [ f : gh ] , the predictions are @xmath453 and @xmath454 .",
    "this deviates for each order by @xmath13 from the observed values @xmath455 and @xmath456 ( averaged over the pmr and pmt directions ) .",
    "while this result was derived for isotropic models , the large predicted deviations from gaussian velocity distributions are likely generic , and would exist in anisotropic models as well .",
    "so if @xmath0 centauri has a central cusp in its projected intensity profile , then the observed velocity distributions rule out models without a dark mass .",

    "since less than a single fast - moving star was predicted , the fact none were observed is not statistically inconsistent with the models .",
    "this does not change when we use larger apertures , since the models do not predict any fast - moving stars outside @xmath370",
    ". it also does not change by using smaller apertures , since in that case the sample of observed stars becomes very small .",
    "therefore , the absence of fast - moving stars in the data can not be used to independently rule out the presence of an imbh with mass @xmath461 . to increase the predicted number of fast - moving stars one would need to increase the number of stars with measured proper motions ,",

    "even then , it is still not possible to rule out an imbh of mass @xmath461 with reasonable confidence .",
    "alternatively , @xmath483 increases and @xmath482 decreases when the bh mass is increased . for the imbh of mass @xmath484 suggested by ngb08 , and sticking as before with our high - quality proper motion catalog of section  [ sss : hstsample ] , we obtain @xmath485 and @xmath486 for the aperture with @xmath370 .",
    "this implies that the absence of fast - moving stars rules out all imbhs with @xmath487 at 95% confidence .",

    "if this happens faster than the main sequence evolution time of these stars ( i.e. , before they become compact remnants ) , then they will undergo physical collisions that lead to the formation of a single very massive star ( vms ) .",
    "such a vms could plausibly evolve into an imbh .",
    "portegies zwart & mcmillan ( 2002 ) proposed the aforementioned scenario and performed @xmath532-body simulations to show that a vms might grow to @xmath533% , with @xmath534 being the total cluster mass .",

    "the four other clusters in the table only provide upper limits in the range @xmath527@xmath359% .",
    "therefore , the data allow us to probe in a mass range that is of interest in view of existing theories .",
    "the imbhs suspected in some globular clusters may have been similar to the initial seeds that grew to supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the centers of galaxies .",
    "it is therefore of interest to compare the results in table  [ t : demo ] to what is known about smbhs .",
    "the masses of smbhs scale with either the galaxy bulge mass @xmath540 , or alternatively , with the fourth power of the velocity dispersion @xmath136 . haering & rix ( 2004 ) found that @xmath541% .",

    "we have presented a detailed dynamical analysis of the star - count , surface - brightness , and kinematical data available for @xmath0 centauri , with a particular focus on the new hst data presented in paper  i. based on the observed profile of the projected density , our models use the jeans equation to yield predictions for the projected profiles of rms line - of - sight velocity @xmath135 or proper motion @xmath543 as function of projected distance @xmath39 from the cluster center , in each of the three orthogonal coordinate directions ( line of sight , proper motion radial , and proper motion tangential ) .",
    "we do not include the effect of mass segregation on the model predictions at large radii , but we do take into account the observed ( partial ) energy equipartition between stars of different masses .",
    "the predictions are compared in a @xmath149 sense to observations , to infer the best - fit values of the model parameters and their error bars .",
    "the model parameters are uniquely determined by the data . the profile @xmath88 of the intrinsic velocity anisotropy is tightly constrained by the observed profile @xmath544(r)$ ] .",
    "the models are therefore unaffected by the mass - anisotropy degeneracy that often plagues line - of - sight velocity studies .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio @xmath55 of the stellar population is fixed by normalization of the observed @xmath176 and @xmath308 at large radii .",
    "the distance @xmath49 is set by comparison of the observed @xmath308 in mas / yr to the predicted @xmath545 in km / s . and the presence and properties of any dark mass in the center , such as an imbh or dark cluster ,",
    "are constrained by the behaviors of @xmath176 and @xmath308 at small radii .",
    "the new hst proper motion data provide a significant improvement in our ability to constrain the dynamical models of @xmath0 centauri , as compared to previous modeling efforts ( e.g. , vdv06 ; ngb08 ) .",
    "the hst sample increases the number of stars with one or more accurately measured velocity components by about an order of magnitude .",
    "this allows for the first time the measurement of velocity dispersions at @xmath364 .",
    "we have derived kinematical profiles down to @xmath546 , at which point there cease to be enough stars with measured proper motions to accurately measure a dispersion .",
    "the profile of @xmath308 is consistent with being flat in the central @xmath547 .",
    "the absence of an increase in rms stellar velocities towards the center provides strong constraints on the possible presence of any dark mass .    the hst star count data from paper  i provide an upper limit @xmath548 to the central logarithmic cusp of slope of the projected density profile .",
    "the innermost data points are well matched by previously published king and wilson models with a flat core .",
    "a generalized nuker profile fits best at all cluster radii when a shallow cusp is invoked , but this overpredicts the innermost datapoints at @xmath549 .",
    "dynamical model predictions depend sensitively on whether or not there is a density cusp , so in our analysis we considered separately models with a core ( @xmath3 ) and models with a cusp ( @xmath550 ) .",
    "the inferred intrinsic anisotropy profile , distance , and stellar mass - to - light ratio are all insensitive to the exact light and mass distributions near the center .",
    "we find that the anisotropy changes from slightly radial near the center to significantly tangential in the outer parts .",
    "the presence of velocity anisotropy is not surprising , given the long two - body relaxation time of @xmath0 centauri and the existence of other evidence that the cluster is not yet fully relaxed .",
    "the inferred distance is @xmath551 and the mass - to - light ratio is @xmath552 .",
    "the error bars take into account both the uncertainties in the kinematical data and the uncertainty in the cusp slope @xmath238 .",
    "these results match extremely well with those obtained by vdv06 using more sophisticated modeling tools .",
    "this agreement supports our assertion that spherical models based on the jeans equation are sufficient for the goals of the present paper , and in particular for constraining the mass distribution near the center .",
    "the facts that the ellipticity and rotation of @xmath0 centauri are both known to decrease towards the center provide further motivation for this assertion .",
    "models with a core provide a good fit to the kinematical data without any dark mass .",
    "since a core is also consistent with the observed density profile , this implies that the presence of an imbh is not required in @xmath0 centauri . by contrast , models with a shallow cusp provide a good fit only when an imbh is invoked , with @xmath553",
    "indeed , an imbh can induce a shallow density cusp ( baumgardt , makino & hut 2005 ) . without a dark mass ,",
    "the predicted rms velocities in the cusp model decrease towards the cluster center and the predicted velocity distributions become highly non - gaussian .",
    "neither prediction is consistent with the observations .    upon combination of the predictions for the core and cusp models we obtain as final result an upper limit to the mass of any possible imbh of @xmath554 at @xmath14 confidence ( or @xmath555 at @xmath413 confidence ) .",
    "the @xmath14 limit corresponds to @xmath15% .",
    "this is of similar magnitude as the range that has now been probed for several other clusters as well .",
    "however , lower values of @xmath556 will need to be probed to definitively assess the most plausible theories for imbh formation in globular clusters , or to assess whether globular clusters may follow the same black hole demographics correlations as galaxies .",
    "isotropic models are not accurate for @xmath0 centauri , since they do not reproduce the observed deviations of @xmath544(r)$ ] from unity .",
    "use of isotropic models to fit @xmath557 yields spuriously high imbh masses .",
    "isotropic models do provide a reasonable guide for calculation of predicted velocity distribution shapes ( as opposed to rms values ) in the central region .",
    "the predicted gauss - hermite moments as function of radius for such models fit the observations in the central arcmin to within @xmath558 . in models with an imbh ,",
    "the wings of the velocity distribution for an aperture on the very center are predicted to be more extended than in models without an imbh .",
    "however , for cusp models with plausible imbh masses we would not have expected more than a single star in the data set to have a velocity component in excess of @xmath559 ( @xmath560 times the cluster velocity dispersion ) .",
    "no such stars were observed in our data .",
    "given the small number statistics , this does not provide meaningful new constraints on the imbh mass for this particular cluster .",
    "the dark mass invoked in cusp models may in principle be extended .",
    "the @xmath149 of the fit yields a limit @xmath561 on the extent of any dark cluster at @xmath14 confidence .",
    "the corresponding central density is @xmath562 times larger than the central density of luminous matter .",
    "this would be indicative of quite an extreme amount of mass segregation .",
    "if @xmath0 centauri does have a cusp and a dark mass , then an imbh may be easier to explain theoretically than such a concentrated dark cluster .",
    "the imbh mass suggested by ngb08 is strongly ruled out in all models .",
    "they found @xmath563 from isotropic modeling and @xmath564 from anisotropic modeling .",
    "by contrast , we find that any imbh in excess of @xmath565 is ruled out at @xmath413 or higher confidence .",
    "this difference is not surprising , given that our observations have not reproduced the arguments on which their imbh mass was based ( namely , their choice of cluster center , their finding of an increase in dispersion towards that center , and their finding of a cusp around that center ) .",
    "if one ignores these fundamental differences , then maybe our results do not appear so different from those ngb08 . when comparing similar models between the two studies ( i.e. , cusp models with and without anisotropy ) ,",
    "the differences in the implied imbh masses are at the @xmath566 confidence level , given the uncertainties quoted by ngb08 ( with our masses being lower ) .",
    "however , the more important difference is that we find that core models with no imbh are perfectly consistent with the data .",
    "by contrast , ngb08 concluded that models with a core and models without an imbh were ruled out with least @xmath413 confidence .",
    "so while ngb08 argued for a significant imbh detection , we find by contrast that there is no need to invoke an imbh in omega cen at all .",
    "our finding that @xmath0 centauri can not have an imbh as massive as suggested by ngb08 is consistent with arguments presented by maccarone & servillat ( 2008 ) .",
    "they found that accretion models with the ngb08 imbh mass predict much more x - ray and radio emission than is observed from the cluster center .",
    "to further strengthen the conclusions from this paper and our understanding of @xmath0 centauri , it will be useful to proceed with the construction of more sophisticated equilibrium models .",
    "methods for numerical creation of axisymmetric models through orbit superposition have been developed by , e.g. , vdv06 , van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and chaname et al .",
    "these models can fit the observed differences between major and minor axis kinematics ( discussed in appendix  b ) .",
    "they can also make use of the 47,781 high - quality proper motions along the major axis at @xmath5676 arcmin , which were excluded from consideration here ( discussed in appendix  c ) .",
    "this will yield constraints on the inclination , rotation properties , and the presence of any kinematic subcomponents .",
    "it should also yield further improved limits on the possible presence of any dark mass in the center .",
    "construction of non - equilibrium models for @xmath0 centauri would be useful as well .",
    "@xmath532-body , monte - carlo , or fokker - planck models might shed light on the evolutionary status of @xmath0 centauri , and on how it arrived at its present structure .",
    "this would also provide a more self - consistent description of the joint effects of mass segregation and energy equipartition than we have provided here .",
    "moreover , it would be able to explicitly account for the brownian motion of a possible imbh .",
    "we are grateful to ivan king , dean mclaughlin , pat seitzer , and glenn van de ven for useful discussions and/or providing data in electronic format .",
    "suggestions from the referees helped us improve the presentation of our results .",
    "to extract kinematics from a set of discrete data points , we select the stars that fall in a given area on the sky ( e.g. , a circular aperture , annulus , polar wedge , or square aperture ) . for these stars",
    "we then select the measurements @xmath568 in a given coordinate direction ( e.g. , line of sight , proper motion radial , proper motion tangential , proper motion major , or proper motion minor ) .",
    "the @xmath569 may be either velocities in km / s or proper motions in mas / yr . the goal is to determine the underlying distribution from which the measurements are drawn .",
    "we assume that this is a gaussian with mean @xmath570 and dispersion @xmath136 , and we set out to determine @xmath570 and @xmath136 with their error bars . if the measurement errors @xmath571 are all identical then the problem has straightforward analytical solutions . however , this is not generally the case , so that more complicated analysis is required ( e.g. , appendix  a of vdv06 ) .",
    "we start with a trial estimate of @xmath136 .",
    "each measurement @xmath569 is then drawn from a gaussian with dispersion @xmath572 .",
    "hence , the velocity w and its error bar @xmath573 follow from straightforward weighted averaging @xmath574 we then determine the value of @xmath136 which maximizes the likelihood @xmath575 ) \\rbrace , \\ ] ] by numerically solving the equation @xmath576 .",
    "having obtained @xmath136 , we return to an improved determination of @xmath570 and we iterate the procedure until convergence .",
    "this provides a fixed point iteration scheme for determination of the joint maximum likelihood solutions for @xmath570 and @xmath136 .    as described in appendix  a of vdv06 , the maximum likelihood solution for @xmath136 yields a subtly biased estimate of the true dispersion .",
    "vdv06 used an analytical approximation to correct for this .",
    "here we have used a monte - carlo procedure instead .",
    "after the determination of @xmath577 , we draw pseudo - data sets from the corresponding gaussian probability distribution . to this",
    "we add random gaussian errors drawn from the observational uncertainties .",
    "we then analyze numerous such pseudo - datasets in the same fashion as the real data .",
    "the statistics of the monte - carlo results provide both an estimate of the bias in @xmath136 ( which we use to correct our maximum likelihood estimate ) and of the uncertainty @xmath578 .",
    "after the calculation of @xmath570 and @xmath136 has been completed , the rms value @xmath135 and its uncertainty can be obtained from @xmath579^{1/2 } / { \\bar \\sigma } .\\ ] ] for the hst proper motion data , our analysis procedure removed all mean motions ( see section  [ sss : hstrot ] ) . therefore , we know that the mean of the underlying distribution for any data set extracted from it should be @xmath580 . for this case",
    "we determined @xmath581 more efficiently as the solution of the maximum likelihood equation @xmath576 at fixed @xmath582 .",
    "in a spherical system one expects the projected kinematics to be the same along any axis through the center . one also expects that the projected kinematics for the proper motion coordinate along any fixed direction , when averaged over a circle , will be independent of the chosen direction .",
    "these expectations are not realized in practice , and this provides a kinematical signature of the axisymmetry of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "vdv06 discussed this in detail for the ground - based kinematical data . here",
    "we briefly discuss this issue for the hst proper motion data .",
    "we have extracted major and minor axis subsamples from our hst proper motion sample , consisting of the stars lying within @xmath583 from either axis .",
    "when averaged over all radii @xmath292 , we find for the radial proper motion direction that @xmath584 along the major axis , and @xmath585 along the minor axis .",
    "for the tangential proper motion direction we find that @xmath586 along the major axis , and @xmath587 along the minor axis . in a spherical system",
    "the kinematics would be the same along the two axes . in reality , @xmath132 is @xmath588% lower along the minor axis than along the major axis , while @xmath133 is @xmath589% higher along the minor axis than along the major axis .",
    "there is no statistically significant variation with radius in these comparisons ( for @xmath335 ) .",
    "an alternative way to look at these results is to consider the fixed major and minor directions on the sky , and to measure the rms projected proper motion components @xmath590 and @xmath591 along these directions , respectively .",
    "for the major axis subsample we find @xmath592 . for the minor axis subsample we find @xmath593 .",
    "when averaged over the whole sample ( i.e. , over all position angles ) we find that @xmath594 .",
    "therefore , the rms projected velocity along the major axis is always larger than that along the minor axis .",
    "this was also found by vdv06 , who obtained for the 718 stars with all three velocity components measured that @xmath595 ( see their appendix c and also their figure  c.1 ) .",
    "these results are relatively easily understood heuristically . for an axisymmetric system that is not too far from edge - on ,",
    "@xmath590 is primarily related to the pressure along the equatorial plane and @xmath591 is primarily related to the pressure along the symmetry axis .",
    "the former must exceed the latter in an oblate system , as dictated by the tensor virial theorem ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sss : hstsample ] , there is also proper motion data available from paper  i for another field that was observed at multiple epochs with hst .",
    "this field lies roughly along the major axis , and therefore does not provide coverage of the full range of position angles in @xmath0 centauri .",
    "we therefore did not use it for our model fitting .",
    "however , we address here the major axis profiles that can be extracted from these data . this allows a comparison with the central field and our model predictions to check for consistency .",
    "we defined both for the central field and the major axis field a major - axis subsample consisting of stars lying within @xmath583 from the major axis .",
    "this is the largest wedge for which coverage over the full range of allowed position angles is guaranteed at the majority of radii @xmath39 . for the central field",
    "we have complete coverage for @xmath596 .",
    "for the major axis field we have complete coverage for @xmath597 .",
    "we extracted the profiles of @xmath272 and @xmath273 for both subsamples , following the procedures described in section  [ sss : hstrms ] .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ f : outer ] .",
    "the hst profiles are continuous at the boundary between the central and major axis fields , as they should be .    at radii @xmath292",
    ", we have complete coverage in the central field over all position angles .",
    "we can therefore calculate the ratios of the projected rms proper motions measured within @xmath583 from the major axis and averaged over an entire circle , respectively .",
    "this yields @xmath598 and @xmath599 .",
    "if we assume as a simple approximation that these ratios are independent of radius , then this allows us to compare the predictions of our dynamical models to the observed major axis profiles .",
    "the curves in figure  [ f : outer ] are the model predictions for our best - fitting anisotropic model with a core and no dark mass ( see figure  [ f : rmsfit]a ) , scaled by the previously quoted ratios @xmath600 and @xmath601 .    the model curves thus obtained provide an excellent fit to the @xmath272 data for the major axis field .",
    "also , the @xmath272 data for the major axis field are consistent with the data from vdv06 , which are also shown in the figure . by contrast",
    ", the fit to the @xmath273 data for the major axis field is good only for @xmath602 . at larger radii",
    ", the data fall below the model , and they also fall below the data from vdv06 . we attribute this to the inability of the hst proper motion data to measure absolute rotation @xmath603 . as a result , we expect to progressively underestimate @xmath133 with increasing radius , since @xmath604 increases with radius ( see section  [ sss : hstrot ] ) .",
    "the fact that the data - model comparison is more successful for @xmath272 is explained by the fact that pmr is orthogonal to direction of absolute rotation , and it is therefore insensitive to it .    taking into consideration the limitations inherent to the data for the major axis field , and the results presented here , we have no reason to believe that detailed modeling of the data for the major axis field would significantly alter the conclusions of our paper .",
