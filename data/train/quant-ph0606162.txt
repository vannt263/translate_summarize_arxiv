    "@xcite , a scalable quantum computing architecture was proposed .",
    "the architecture utilizes magnetic interaction of complex open - shell atoms confined to the nodes of an optical lattice .",
    "the lattice is placed in a high gradient magnetic field and the resultant zeeman sublevels define qubit states .",
    "microwave pulses tuned to space - dependent resonant frequencies are used for individual addressing .",
    "nearest neighbor magnetic - dipolar atomic interactions allow for the implementation of a quantum controlled not gate .",
    "for certain atoms , the resulting single - qubit gate operation times are on the order of microseconds , while the two - qubit operations require milliseconds .",
    "these times are much faster than the anticipated decoherence times .    while the magnetic interaction is weak ( so the gate operations are relatively slow ) , it is the goal of this paper to investigate a potential route to strengthening inter - atomic interactions by bringing atoms closer in optical lattices of reduced periodicity .",
    "the proposed architecture offers several distinct advantages .",
    "for example , compared to the popular scheme with rydberg gates  @xcite , the advantages are : ( i ) individual addressing of atoms with _ unfocused _ beams of microwave radiation , ( ii ) coherent `` always - on '' magnetic - dipolar interactions between the atoms , and ( iii ) substantial decoupling of the motional and inner degrees of freedom .    before proceeding further , it is worth remembering the following order - of - magnitude values relevant to the architecture of ref .",
    "dercan04 : light - shifts and the depth of the optical wells are about 1 mhz , typical zeeman splitings are 1 ghz , and the difference in the resonant zeeman frequency for two neighboring wells is about 1 khz .",
    "optical lattices of reduced periodicity have been proposed in refs .  @xcite . in this section",
    "we review the underlying laser field - atom configuration and formalism , and then specialize the general formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath0 atomic zeeman manifold .",
    "the optically coupled states are either @xmath13 or @xmath14 and the lower - manifold splitting is due to the zeeman interaction . ]    in the atom - field geometry of ref .",
    "@xcite , a neutral atom interacts with four laser beams of equal intensities arranged as two counter - propagating raman pairs , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ramansetup ] . the carrier frequencies of the pairs are denoted as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the lasers are off - resonant with the upper manifold @xmath17 ; neglecting a small difference in detunings from the @xmath17 state for the two pairs , we use a single value for the detuning @xmath18 , although it is this difference in detuning that allows us to neglect interference ( modulated stark shifts ) between fields having frequences @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) that would give rise to the conventional @xmath6 periodicity of the optical lattice @xcite .",
    "each pair drives a two - photon transition between the substates @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the ground - state manifold .",
    "as shown in the figure , the complementary fields @xmath25 of each pair could be detuned from resonance by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the splitting between the ground state sublevels .",
    "in addition to raman - induced interactions each sublevel experiences position - independent light - shifts due to the interaction with the four individual laser fields .",
    "we are interested in solving the schrdinger equation for the described raman atom - field geometry .",
    "at first we neglect atomic center - of - mass ( c.m . ) motion and obtain solutions with the optical hamiltonian @xmath28 which incorporates internal atomic hamiltonian and the four atom - laser interactions .",
    "we will return to the question of c.m .",
    "motion in section  sec : decoh . solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath29provides dressed atomic states @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 encapsulate internal and external ( c.m . )",
    "degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "below we outline a method of solving the above equation developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . to solve eq.([eq : tdsedressed ] )",
    ", we adiabatically eliminate the excited state and expand the dressed states @xmath30 in terms of atomic stationary states of the lower manifold . as a result one arrives at a system of first - order linear differential equations for the amplitudes of the ground state manifold .",
    "the rhs of the equations can be expresses as a matrix multiplied by a vector of ground manifold amplitudes .",
    "we denote this matrix @xmath33 , it is easily reconstructed from explicit expressions given by eq.(17 ) of ref .",
    "diagonalization of the matrix @xmath33 produces a set of position - dependent optical potentials @xmath34 and eigenvectors that define the dressed states @xmath35 . in section  [ sec : qcops ] , we define qubit states in terms of these dressed states .",
    "each dressed state has a characteristic time - dependence @xmath36the position - dependent phase leading to an optical force @xmath37 acting on the atom .    having reviewed the general standing - wave raman setup and the accompanying formalism , we specialize our discussion to an atom with the total angular momenta of @xmath38 for the lower manifold and @xmath39 for the upper manifold .",
    "a practically relevant example is the metastable @xmath40 state of al atom .",
    "it has been used in a matter - wave deposition experiment  mcggillee95 , where the atoms were cooled on the closed transition to the @xmath41 state ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we estimate the lifetime of the @xmath40 state to be in the order of @xmath43 seconds , much longer than the anticipated decoherence / loading / cooling time scales .",
    "a number of other open - shell atoms have @xmath0 ground states as well .    in the b - field required for addressing individual atoms , the @xmath0 manifold splits into four zeeman levels . for al , the lande factor is 4/3 and the zeeman ladder in the b - field @xmath44 is given by @xmath45the @xmath46-@xmath47 raman fields couple only @xmath48 to @xmath49 and @xmath50 to @xmath51 and effectively we deal with a pair of independent two - level subsystems . moreover , while constructing the matrices @xmath33 , we find that they are equivalent ; the only difference between the subsystems comes from the fact that in the b - field the level @xmath48 is below @xmath49 , while @xmath51 is above @xmath49 .",
    "for zero raman detuning @xmath52 this symmetry leads to identical optical potentials for the two sub - systems .",
    "for non - zero detunings , the potentials are related to each other by changing @xmath53 .",
    "the resulting _ four _ optical potentials may be parameterized as @xmath54where the superscripts in @xmath55 specify optically coupled zeeman pairs . here",
    "we introduce the reduced dynamic polarizability @xmath56 , with the rabi frequency @xmath57 defined in terms of the reduced dipole matrix element and the ( equal ) strengths of individual laser e - fields .",
    "the derived optical potentials and the corresponding dressed states depend on the adjustable detuning @xmath52 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ramansetup ] . because of the @xmath58 mapping , for @xmath59 the optical potentials for the two sets of zeeman levels coincide .",
    "however , the resulting @xmath60 and @xmath61 potentials are energetically shifted with respect to each other and this energy gap might lead to a non - unform loading of the lattice .",
    "below we optimize the choice of the detuning @xmath52 .",
    "first we focus on the @xmath62 optically coupled zeeman pair .",
    "a particular choice of @xmath63 leads to a pair of potentials , @xmath64that are energetically equivalent ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : optpot ] ) . as an additional benefit , at this value of @xmath52",
    "the potentials have the largest intersite barriers . in going from eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) to ( eq : upmoptimal ) , we have taken @xmath65 rather than @xmath66 to avoid important non - adiabatic coupling between the potentials that would occur had we taken the absolute value  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the detuning @xmath67 is chosen to compensate for the difference in the light shifts for the two sub - levels .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : optpot ] , the minima of each individual potential are separated by @xmath6 . in addition",
    ", the potentials are shifted with respect to each other .",
    "this produces potential minima separated by @xmath2 . in other words , if the lattice is properly loaded , the distance between the neighboring atoms is @xmath68 .",
    "compared to the conventional @xmath6 lattices , the use of the described raman configurations increases the atomic dipolar interactions by a factor of @xmath69 .",
    "the eigenstates of the optical hamiltonian ( omitting the potential dependence , c.f .",
    "eq.([eq : untildedphidef ] ) ) are @xmath70of course , the separation between adjacent potential minima in conventional _ _ lin__@xmath71_lin _ lattices is also @xmath2 , but each adjacent minima contains atoms in a given magnetic substate and is not suitable for the computing scheme described in this paper .",
    "the problem with the above choice of detuning @xmath72 is that it optimizes only the potentials for the @xmath62 pair . for the other ,",
    "@xmath73 , pair the optimal choice would be @xmath74 . if we keep the @xmath63 detuning , the height of the intersite barriers for the @xmath75 pair would be just @xmath76 of the optimal values and in addition the corresponding @xmath77 and @xmath78 potentials would be energetically separated . to rectify this problem , we envision adding another independent set of four laser beams . to distinguish between the two sets",
    ", we will use primed quantities for this second set .",
    "this second quadruplet would be raman resonant for the @xmath75 coupled sublevels .",
    "the required detuning is @xmath79 .",
    "we further require that the relative phases of the laser fields for the two quads are adjusted so that both resulting sets of @xmath80 potentials coincide , i.e. , @xmath81 . the eigenstates are @xmath82we assume that the dominant trapping is produced by the ( two - photon ) resonant fields , but detailed calculations are needed to confirm this assumption .",
    "notice that in the b - field gradient the raman detuning @xmath52 would change across the lattice sites .",
    "however , the change ( @xmath83 increment per site ) is small compared to the typical light - shifts , @xmath84 implying that the resonance conditions @xmath85 is little changed over the entire sample .    to summarize results of the discussion",
    "so far , we have designed a confinement scheme for @xmath0 atoms in magnetic fields .",
    "the atoms are separated by a distance of @xmath12 , improving the performance of multi - atom gates over the conventional @xmath86 schemes . in the following section",
    "we address operations of a quantum computer based on the described @xmath87 lattice .    ) , for the optimal choice of raman detuning @xmath88 .",
    "while each individual potential @xmath77 and @xmath78 has a @xmath89 periodicity , the minima of the potentials interleave , with the resulting distance between trapped atoms being @xmath90 . ]",
    "first we define the qubit states in terms of the eigenstates , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phiopt],[eq : phioptprime ] ) , of the optical hamiltonian .",
    "we assume that the atoms are in the lamb - dicke confinement regime , and the atoms are trapped at the minima of the @xmath77 and @xmath91 potentials ( fig .  [ fig : optpot ] ) with 1:1 occupation ratio .",
    "the definition of the qubit depends on whether the atom is trapped at @xmath77 or @xmath78 minima . for the @xmath77 wells , @xmath92while for the @xmath78 wells @xmath93where @xmath94 is an integer . to individually address the qubits , we introduce a b - field gradient and use pulses of microwave radiation of various duration to execute one - qubit operations",
    "however , compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , here we deal with the dressed states . describing dynamics of the system requires certain care . for concreteness , we focus on an atom in the @xmath60 well , but the conclusions will apply equally to the @xmath61 wells .",
    "the total hamiltonian including interaction @xmath95 with circularly - polarized mw radiation of frequency @xmath96 reads @xmath97 .",
    "the duration of the drive should be chosen to resolve different zeeman transition frequencies between ground state sublevels near the potential minima of a single well , as well as transition frequencies between adjacent @xmath60 and @xmath61 potential wells .",
    "these conditions can be satisfied easily , as the change of the zeeman frequency for two neighboring sites is @xmath98 , while the light - shifts are in the order of 1 mhz .",
    "under such an assumption , the atomic wavefunction can be expanded as @xmath99 .",
    "taking into account eq.([eq : tdsedressed ] ) , we arrive at the system of coupled equations for the expansion amplitudes , @xmath100while evaluating matrix elements we find that the resonant frequencies are @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "the resonance at @xmath103 corresponds to transitions between the @xmath50 and @xmath49 sublevels , while those at@xmath104 correspond to transitions between @xmath48 and @xmath105 or @xmath49 and @xmath51 .",
    "again , due to the orders - of - magnitude difference in the zeeman and the light - shift energy scales , we may resolve these resonance frequencies and find it convenient to work at @xmath106 .",
    "for the selected transition , the above system of equations maps onto the problem of a two - level system in an oscillating field . by varying the duration of the mw pulses",
    ", we may execute arbitrary rotations in the hilbert space spanned by individual qubits .",
    "since the zeeman splitting is position - dependent , only a single qubit from the entire ensemble will respond to a pulse of a certain frequency .",
    "the advantage of the proposed addressing scheme is that there is no need to focus radiation on an individual atom .",
    "now we turn to another important ingredient of qc architectures : multi - qubit gates .",
    "it is sufficient to consider operation of the universal two - qubit cnot gate  @xcite . in the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite the resonance frequency of the target qubit should depend on the state of the control qubit .",
    "this leads to a conditional quantum dynamics : the transition in the target qubit occurs only if the control qubit is in a predefined state . in our scheme",
    ", this dependence of the resonance frequency is due to magnetic interactions between two neighboring atoms .",
    "indeed , we find that each qubit state posses a permanent magnetic - dipole moment aligned with the z - axis : @xmath107 , @xmath108 ( these values are independent of the well ) .",
    "the generated magnetic field at the position of the target qubit is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath111 is the distance between the qubits .",
    "depending on the state of the control qubit the generated field will either increase or reduce the offset b - field @xmath112 and modify the zeeman frequency . while performing the gate",
    ", one needs to resolve the frequency difference @xmath113the minimum duration of the mw pulse is @xmath114 . for our parameters , @xmath115 .",
    "the resulting performance is competitive with other quantum computing schemes such as nuclear magnetic resonance  lafknicor02 ( @xmath116 s ) , and controlled collisions  @xcite ( @xmath117 s ) .",
    "the gate operations must be much faster than decoherence rates .",
    "a number of decoherence mechanisms present in the current proposal have been analyzed in ref .",
    "for example , atoms may be lost due to an entanglement of the internal and motional degrees of freedom during the not gate operation .",
    "it was demonstrated  @xcite that the associated excitation rates from the ground motional state are negligible .",
    "the underlying reason is that the induced perturbation is adiabatically slow : on the time scale of the not pulse , the atomic c.m . undergoes many oscillations in the well .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the present proposal .",
    "however , the dressed ( qubit ) states were introduced in sec .",
    "sec : lamo8 neglecting the c.m .",
    "motion and we need to additionally consider coupling of dressed states due to the atomic motion . fortunately , as shown below , it is straightforward to demonstrate that the qubit states are not coupled by the c.m .",
    "motion .",
    "another important source of the decoherence arises due to magnetic noise .",
    "the qubit states are defined in terms of the zeeman sublevels sensitive to magnetic perturbations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a noise - induced dephasing has been evaluated , and it has been shown that the decoherence rate can be reduced with modest b - field shielding requirements . in the present proposal ,",
    "the implications of the magnetic noise can be more severe : for dressed states , the relative phase ( determined by the zeeman splitting ) between the `` bare '' magnetic substates must remain fixed .",
    "the noise perturbs the relative phase leading to excitations of the motional quanta .    in section",
    "ii , the dressed states @xmath118 were found by assuming that the atom was localized at the position @xmath32 and then by diagonalizing the position - dependent optical matrix @xmath119 .",
    "taking into account that for a fixed @xmath32 , the @xmath118 form a complete basis set , we may expand the exact wave function as @xmath120where @xmath121 are ( generally coupled ) c.m .",
    "wave functions of interest .",
    "the hamiltonian including the c.m .",
    "motion is @xmath122with @xmath123 being the kinetic energy operator for the c.m .",
    "motion . using the standard technique of projecting the schrdinger equation onto the @xmath124 basis , we find @xmath125where the inner product is with respect to the internal degrees of freedom @xmath126 . the coupling between the two components @xmath127 and",
    "@xmath128 arises in general due to the off - diagonal term in the sum . in our case ,",
    "the dressed states @xmath129 do not depend on @xmath32 , eqs.(eq : phiopt ) and ( [ eq : phioptprime ] ) , and we arrive at a simple result @xmath130this is a physically significant result : the atomic motion does not lead to mixing of the qubit states .    at the minima of the potentials ,",
    "the bottom of the potential well can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential and we can write @xmath131 as a sum of the time - dependent stationary - states of the harmonic oscillator @xmath132 , @xmath133the coefficients @xmath134 depend on the temperature of the qubit and the loading process ; we assume that initially only the ground motional states are occupied .",
    "we also require that the potential is sufficiently deep so that the atoms do not tunnel away , see ref .",
    "@xcite for estimates .",
    "now we can analyze the effect of time - dependent magnetic noise @xmath135 acting on the qubit .",
    "let us take , for example , the qubit in the state @xmath136 localized in the motional ground state @xmath137 of one of the minima of @xmath138 for @xmath139 . for @xmath140 , the magnetic noise is turned on and we look at the decoherence rate of the qubit .",
    "we consider the loss mechanism as a two - step process .",
    "the magnetic field acts only on the internal degree of freedom of the qubit causing a primary transition @xmath141 .",
    "minima of @xmath77 correspond to maxima of @xmath78 so the new state @xmath142 is motionally unstable .",
    "for example , one of the possible transitions this state undergoes is @xmath143 .",
    "the exact details of this secondary transition are not important , since the entire decoherence rate is determined by the rate of the primary excitation . for example , characteristic time associated with the @xmath143 route is @xmath144 .",
    "our estimate for al atom , @xmath145 and @xmath146 results in @xmath147 .",
    "the decoherence rate is determined by the primary excitation @xmath148 and below we determine the probability associated with this process .",
    "the required time evolution of the coefficient @xmath149 is computed by including the magnetic noise perturbation @xmath150 in the schrdinger equation @xmath151where @xmath152 , and @xmath153 is the energy difference between the minimum and the maximum of the @xmath138 and @xmath61 potentials , eq([eq : upmoptimal ] ) .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ c - eq ] ) is @xmath154the magnetic noise is characterized by its autocorrelation function @xmath155where @xmath156 is the frequency - dependent spectral density of the noise .",
    "the autocorrelation function @xmath157 represents the probability @xmath158 of excitation @xmath159 , @xmath160for time @xmath161 sufficiently short to guarantee that @xmath162 , and find @xmath163with @xmath164 .    for coherence times on the order of 10 seconds",
    "the magnetic noise should satisfy @xmath165this level can be attained with passive shielding  @xcite .",
    "moreover , notice that the spectral density of the noise is evaluated at a relatively high ( @xmath166 ) frequency .",
    "this frequency is of the order of the light shift induced by the lattice lasers . at such a high frequency the magnetic noise is highly suppressed .",
    "for example , for passive shielding , the characteristic cut - off frequency due to induced currents is in the order of khz  @xcite .",
    "to conclude , our analysis suggests that magnetic noise can be controlled at an adequate level .",
