    "the narrow - band - gap semiconductor bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ( e@xmath11@xmath120.35ev)@xcite has been best known for a long time as an excellent thermoelectric material because of their unique near - gap electronic structure and high thermoelectric figure of merit zt = s@xmath13@xmath14t / k .",
    "@xcite recently , with the development of topological insulators(tis),@xcite it attracts the research attention again .",
    "ti is a new state having an energy gap in its bulk band structure and metallic helical states on its surface , which distinct from simple metal or insulator .",
    "@xcite bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is a strong three dimensional(3d ) topological insulator with its surface states consisting of single dirac cone at the @xmath15 point which is protected by the time - reversal symmetry from any time - reversal perturbation , such as crystal defects and nonmagnetic impurities.@xcite particularly , its bulk band gap is much larger than the energy scale of room temperature , making it the most suitable candidate for the high - temperature spintronics application.@xcite + whether as thermoelectric material or topological insulators , the native defects in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 play important role in the material . as thermoelectric material , it needs well - defined electrical and thermal conductivities , high mobility of free current carriers , and thermoelectric power , all of them will be influenced by the presence of native defects .",
    "@xcite as a topological insulator , the intrinsic defects such as antisites or vacancies behave as n type dopant and consequently shift the fermi level above the dirac point , which makes it difficult to characterize the topological transport properties and to realize topological devices because both of them severely rely on the behavior of surface dirac fermions.@xcite hence , it is vital to investigate the nature of native defects in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 . in experiments , lots",
    "of efforts@xcite have been pursued on such issue .",
    "urazhdin et al.@xcite have found that bi@xmath0se@xmath1 single - crystal behaves as n type material under excess bi or se growth condition .",
    "they predicted that bi@xmath10 antisites contribute shallow acceptors when the samples are doped with excess bi .",
    "however , the solubility of bi in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is very low and the n type doping behavior of the samples is derived from the compensating defects . while when the samples doped with excess se , se@xmath2 antisites introduce shallow donor in the materials.@xcite bludsk et al.@xcite concluded that the presence of overstoichiometric bi atoms can induce the following defects : ( i ) se vacancy carrying two positive charges ( v@xmath16 ) , which is attributed to the main reason for n - type bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ; ( ii ) bi@xmath10 antisite carrying one negative charge ( bi@xmath17 ) ; ( iii ) bi vacancy supposed to carry three negative charges ( v@xmath18 ) ; ( iv ) other complex defects . in theoretical calculations , shuang - xi wang et",
    "al.@xcite have studied the formation energies of native point defects in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , but the study only gave the results under two extreme growing conditions : se - rich and bi - rich .",
    "the systematic study of the evolution of the formation energies according to growth conditions has not been reported as yet .",
    "+ to this end , in our present work , the stability and formation energies of native defects in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 are systematically investigated using first - principles method based on density function theory .",
    "the results indicate that se1 vacancy is a double donor , bi vacancy is a triple acceptor , and se@xmath2 is an always active n - type dopant in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , we find that bi@xmath4 is an amphoteric dopant . by analyzing the formation energies of all defects under different growth conditions ( such as bi - rich or se - rich ) , we find that under se - rich growth condition , se@xmath2 is the most stable one which is independent of electron chemical potential @xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "however , under bi - rich growth condition , se vacancy is the most stable defect , except for a small growth window which is defined by @xmath5@xmath6@xmath80.262ev ( the material is typical n - type ) and @xmath9@xmath5@xmath10@xmath7 - 0.459ev(bi - rich ) . in that growth window ,",
    "one negative charged bi@xmath4 is the most stable native defect .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath21    from eq .",
    "[ equ1 ] ,  [ equ3 ] and  [ equ4 ] , the formation energy formula of point defects in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 as a function of @xmath22 can be described as : + @xmath23 @xmath24 similarly , the formation energy formula as a function of @xmath25 also can be obtained as above .",
    "[ equ5 ] and  [ equ6 ] indicate that the formation energy is a function of @xmath26 and @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , eq.(4 ) tells us that to form bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , @xmath25 and @xmath22 should meet the following condition : @xmath27 @xmath28 the formation energies under different grown environments are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and the typical results for @xmath26=0ev , @xmath26=0.31ev under @xmath22=0ev ( se - rich ) and @xmath25=0ev ( bi - rich ) conditions are listed in tab .",
    "the results as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and ( c ) indicate that under se - rich growth condition , the growth window denote as i in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , se@xmath2 is the most favorable native defect in the system within the full energy window of the electron chemical potential @xmath26 , it behaves as a single donor .",
    "this means that under se - rich growth condition se@xmath2 is the predominant native defect in the system and responsible for the n - type characteristics of the system under such growth condition .",
    "for example , when @xmath22=0ev and @xmath26=0 ev , the formation energy of se@xmath2 is 0.175ev , 1.338ev and 1.244ev lower than that of v@xmath4 , v@xmath2 , and bi@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath29=0ev and @xmath26=0.31ev , the formation energy of se@xmath2 is 0.305ev , 0.235ev , and 0.994ev lower than that of v@xmath4 , v@xmath2 , and bi@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "when the growth window is in the region ii as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , the most favorable native defect is v@xmath4 , whereas in the growth window iii which is confined by @xmath26@xmath80.262ev ( the material is typical n - type ) and @xmath22@xmath7 - 0.459ev(bi - rich ) one negative charged bi@xmath4 is the most favorable one .",
    "this means that under bi - rich growth condition , v@xmath4 is the predominant native defect and it is the main reason for n - type electrical characteristics of the systems .",
    "for example ,",
    "when @xmath25=0ev ( @xmath22=-0.491ev ) , the formation energy of v@xmath4 according to @xmath26=0 ev is 0.213ev , which is 2.391ev , 1.543ev and 0.333ev lower than that of v@xmath2 , se@xmath2 and bi@xmath4 , respectively . only when @xmath22@xmath7 - 0.459ev ( the material is typical n - type ) , p - type bi@xmath4 is the dominant native defect and it behaves as a compensation dopant for the the material .",
    "the formation energy of bi@xmath4 according to @xmath26=0.31ev is 0.605ev , which is 0.048ev , 1.206ev and 1.461ev lower than that of v@xmath4 , v@xmath2 and se@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "+ in experiments , the electronic properties of bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1 crystals are usually dominated by electron donors , resulting in n - type conductivity . based on above analysis",
    ", such n - type conductivity mainly derives from two reasons : first , the formation energy of p - type native defect v@xmath2 is higher than that of n - type native defect , such as se@xmath2 and v@xmath4 .",
    "second , one negative charged p - type native defect bi@xmath4 is only stable when the material is strong n - type and bi - rich growth condition ( @xmath22@xmath7 - 0.459ev ) behaving as a compensation .",
    "moreover , we also find that one positive charged bi@xmath4 only forms when material is p - type and its formation energy is higher than that of v@xmath4 which is difficult to be found in experiment .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) of perfect bi@xmath0se@xmath1 system and three systems with native defect of v@xmath4 , se@xmath2 or bi@xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in comparison with that of perfect system",
    ", it is clearly seen that each defect induces two defect states into the band gap of the material . for v@xmath4 ,",
    "the defect states just below the fermi level mainly come from p states of three nearest neighbor ( nn ) bi atoms of v@xmath4 and are completely filled by two electrons .",
    "the electrons filled the defect states are easily released leading the defect a double donor .",
    "the defect states of se@xmath2 mainly come from p states of four se atoms(the se atom substituted the bi and its three nn se atoms ) , which are half filled .",
    "the electron filled the defect state is easily released leading the defect a single donor .",
    "the defect states of bi@xmath4 mainly come from p states of four bi atoms ( the bi atom substituted se1 and its three nn bi atoms ) , which are half filled . depending on the conductive type of the material ,",
    "either the electron filled the defect states is released leading the defect a donor or the unfilled state capture one electron leading the defect an acceptor .",
    "bi@xmath4 behaves as an amphoteric dopant in the system . +",
    "comparing the dos and the formation energy results , we find that the defect levels in dos are lower than the results of formation energy .",
    "the phenomenon may come from two possible reasons as follows : ( i ) the different relaxed geometries between neutral and charged system .",
    "taking v@xmath10 for example , the distance between bi atoms ( nearest to the se1 layer with vacancy ) changes obviously from 3.834 for q=0 to 4.370 for q=+2 ; ( ii)the correction of vbm for each charged system tend to make both acceptor and donor level higher .",
    "moreover , we also note that although both se@xmath2 and bi@xmath4 induce half filled defect states around the fermi level , se@xmath2 acts as a single donor whereas bi@xmath4 behaves as amphoteric dopant .",
    "the reason is that the un - filled defect level above the fermi level of se@xmath2 is higher than that of the bi@xmath4 , which make it difficult to capture electron acting as p - type dopant .",
    "in present work , we find that v@xmath10 in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is a double donor ; v@xmath2 is a triple acceptor ; se@xmath2 is an active donor , whereas bi@xmath4 is an amphoteric dopant acting as a donor when @xmath5@xmath6@xmath70.119ev(the material is typical p - type ) and as an acceptor when @xmath5@xmath6@xmath80.251ev(the material is typical n - type ) .",
    "the analysis of the stabilities of all defects show that under se - rich growth condition , se@xmath2 is most stable according to all electron chemical potential @xmath5@xmath6 . under bi - rich growth condition , v@xmath10 is the main defect .",
    "one negative charged bi@xmath4 is most stable in a small growth window which defined by @xmath5@xmath6@xmath80.262ev ( the material is typical n - type ) and @xmath9@xmath5@xmath10@xmath7 - 0.459ev(bi - rich ) .",
