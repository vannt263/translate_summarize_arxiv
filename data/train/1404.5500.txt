    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the picture of the fluctuations in branching random walks ( brws ) that we have in mind is the following .",
    "there are essentially three types of fluctuations that may affect the position of the front or of the foremost particle .    1",
    ".   first , there are fluctuations occurring at very early times ( @xmath24 ) , when the system consists in a few particles .",
    "they have a large ( of order 1 ) and lasting impact on the position of the front or of the rightmost particle .",
    "the main effect is given by the random waiting time of the first particle before it splits into two particles , during which it diffuses , but the subsequent waiting times of the latter two particles also contribute , etc ... until the system contains a large enough number of particles that makes it partly `` deterministic '' .",
    "we do not believe that there is a simple way to compute the effect of these fluctuations , since there is no large parameter in the problem which would allow for sensible approximations .",
    "once the system contains many particles , which happens say at time @xmath25 , it enters a `` mean - field '' regime : in a first approximation , its particle density obeys a deterministic evolution with a moving absorptive boundary at a position that we shall call @xmath26 ( and symmetrically at @xmath27 ) , set in such a way that the particle density is 1 at some fixed distance of order 1 to the left or to the right of this boundary , respectively .",
    "these boundaries simulate the discreteness of the particles .",
    "this is the brunet - derrida cutoff @xcite , and it was shown to correctly represent the leading effect of the noise on the position of the front in the context of the stochastic fkpp equation . + from now on , we shall focus on the right boundary .",
    "( the right and the left halves of the brw essentially decouple once the system has grown large enough ) . the large - time expression of the shape of the particle density near the right boundary reads , in such a model @xmath28   \\exp\\left(\\bar x_t - x-\\frac{(\\bar x_t - x)^2}{4t}\\right ) \\theta(\\bar x_t - x ) \\label{eq : shape}\\ ] ] in the region @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is , up to an uninteresting non - universal additive constant , the position of the tip of the front , namely of the right boundary .",
    "the heaviside step function @xmath31 enforces the fact that the particle density is 0 to the right of @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants undetermined at this stage .",
    "@xmath35 is essentially a decreasing exponential supplemented with a gaussian and a linear prefactors .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence enters explicitly as the width of the gaussian , and implicitly through the position @xmath26 of the absorptive boundary .",
    "( there are corrections to the shape of the front at order @xmath0 , namely to the function @xmath36 itself , but it turns out that we do not need to take them into account in our model , except for the determination of one overall numerical constant : we will come back to the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : shape ] ) and of its corrections in sec .",
    "[ sec : det ] . ) + the fluctuations on top of this essentially deterministic front we have just described must take place in the tip region , where the particle density is low .",
    "we shall assume that a single fluctuation effectively gives the dominant correction to the deterministic evolution , and that the distribution @xmath37 of the position @xmath38 of this fluctuation with respect to the tip of the front is exponential : @xmath39 we have found ( see below ) that these fluctuations bring a contribution of order @xmath0 to the average position both of the front and of the rightmost particle in the brw .",
    "3 .   finally , there are tip fluctuations occurring at very late times , say between @xmath40 and @xmath2 , where @xmath41 is of order  1 .",
    "they are also distributed as @xmath42 .",
    "they obviously add noise to the position of the tip of the front , but they do not have an effect on the bulk of the particle distribution since they do not have time to develop their own front at time @xmath2 .",
    "this picture is parallel to the phenomenological model for front fluctuations proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the stochastic fkpp problem .",
    "to arrive at quantitative predictions for the behavior of the brw , we need to introduce random variables that characterize the realizations .",
    "we shall discuss the following ones :    * @xmath43 , the position of the rightmost particle , * @xmath44 , where the sum goes over all the particles in the system , * @xmath45e^{x_i(t)-2t}$ ] .    throughout , we shall denote by @xmath46 the statistical average ( over realizations ) of a given variable @xmath47 in the full stochastic model , and by @xmath48 the value of this variable in a mean - field approximation of the same model with a discreteness cutoff at the tip .",
    "( these notations have already been used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meannbrw ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : shape ] ) ,  ( [ eq : xt ] ) respectively . )",
    "discrete sums over the particles will often be replaced by integrals wherever the particle density is large enough .",
    "+ let us briefly comment on the random variables we have just introduced .",
    "* as already mentioned , @xmath49 is related to the solution of the fkpp equation with the step function as an initial condition . *",
    "the average @xmath50 tends to a constant at large @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , in any given event , the random variable @xmath51 itself tends to a constant , which has some distribution ( which we do not know how to compute ) which may be used to characterize the early - time fluctuations .",
    "note that an appropriate generating function of the moments of y_t_i e^x_i(t)=y_t [ eq : defyt ] also obeys the fkpp equation , but with the `` critical '' initial condition discussed in the introduction .",
    "we will come back to the latter fact in sec .",
    "[ sec : det ] . also , in the context of directed polymers in random media , @xmath52 is the partition function and @xmath53 the free energy averaged over the disorder  @xcite .",
    "* @xmath54 is the variable used by lalley and sellke in the theorem alluded to in the introduction .",
    "however , we are not going to focus on this variable in the body of this paper , since we found it has many drawbacks for our purpose .",
    "first , a practical drawback : although @xmath54 tends almost surely to a positive constant when @xmath55 @xcite , it takes negative values at finite times , with finite probability ; @xmath56 is then undefined in these particular realizations .",
    "second , a theoretical drawback : it turns out that the finite - time corrections to the moments of @xmath56 are very sensitive to the initial fluctuations , the ones that are not computable analytically .",
    "we shall nevertheless quote a few results on the distribution of @xmath56 in appendix  b.    in some intuitive sense , @xmath51 and @xmath56 characterize the position of the `` front '' of a particular realization of the evolution at time @xmath2 .",
    "+ the variables @xmath51 and @xmath56 keep the memory of the initial fluctuations . therefore",
    ", we shall not attempt to compute the distribution of the fluctuations in @xmath57 accumulated over the whole history of the brw , but instead the fluctuations of this variable between two large times @xmath58 and @xmath2 , in order to have a quantity that is independent of the very early times at which there is no mean - field regime .",
    "here , starting from the phenomenological model defined in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] , we shall deduce new results on the distribution @xmath60 of the variable @xmath59 ( and on its moments ) for @xmath61 , up to one single constant for the moments of order larger than 2 , and up to an additional constant for the first moment . throughout , we shall aim at the accuracy @xmath62 for @xmath60 and neglect higher powers of these expansion variables .",
    "we first compute @xmath63 , namely the variable @xmath64 in the mean - field approximation with the cutoff in the tail . using the definition of the variable @xmath64 in sec .",
    "[ sec : var ] and using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : shape]),([eq : xt ] ) , we find @xmath65 at first order in @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath66 is a constant literally equal to @xmath67 in this calculation , but there would also be other contributions to @xmath66 that we can not get from the large-@xmath2 asymptotic shape of the front exhibited in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shape ] ) .",
    "we shall postpone the full calculation of @xmath66 to sec .  [",
    "sec : det ] .",
    "it turns out that the term of order @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : y0 ] ) generates @xmath68 contributions to the distributions and to the moments that we shall address .",
    "hence it is enough for our purpose to keep no more than the constant term , namely we write |y_t-2 .",
    "[ eq : y00 ] we perform a more complete calculation in appendix  [ sec : details ] , keeping the subleading terms , in order to demonstrate that this a priori approximation is indeed accurate enough .",

    "we refer the reader to appendix  a for the details .",
    "the shape of the front generated by this fluctuation will eventually have the form @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a constant that we can not determine since it is related to some `` average '' shape of the fluctuation . with this extra fluctuation , @xmath64 has the following expression : y_t=_-^+dx _ |x_t(x , t)e^x-2 t + c_-^+dx _ |x_,t(x , t - t_1)e^x-2 t  .",
    "the first term is just @xmath63 : we replace it by eq .",

    "the second term is integrated in the same way as the first one , using the expression  ( [ eq : xdelta ] ) for @xmath77 .",

    "thus the forward shift in @xmath51 induced at time @xmath2 by such a fluctuation occurring at time @xmath78 reads y_t = y_t-|y_t = ( 1+c ) .",
    "[ eq : shift ] note that in the asymptotic limit of interest , at first glance , the nontrivial term in this expression seems to be of order @xmath79 , thus , if @xmath80 , it is smaller than our accuracy goal .",

    "we may convert the conjectured probability of a forward fluctuation of size @xmath38 ( eq .  ( [ eq : proba ] ) ) into the probability distribution of the difference of @xmath57 between two times @xmath58 and @xmath82 by simple changes of variables .",
    "we first discuss the variable fy_t - y_t_0 .",
    "the fundamental observation is that a fluctuation may essentially have two opposite effects on @xmath83 .",

    "equations in the class of the sfkpp equation may be thought of , for instance , as representing the dynamics of the particle number density in a branching - diffusion process in which there is in addition a nonlinear selection / saturation process that effectively limits the density of particles .",
    "the realizations of such equations are stochastic traveling waves .",
    "the stochasticity comes from the discreteness of the number of particles . in this context , the ( deterministic ) fkpp equation represents the mean - field ( or infinite number of particle ) limit of the full dynamics",

    "@xcite where the so - called @xmath257 expansion ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) was applied to study fluctuations in the context of reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "later , we could obtain new analytical results thanks to a phenomenological model  @xcite .",
    "the picture encoded in our model was the following : most of the time , the traveling wave front propagates deterministically , obeying the ordinary deterministic fkpp equation supplemented with a cutoff in the tail , accounting for discreteness by making sure that the number density of particles reaches 0 rapidly whenever it drops below 1 .",
    "brunet and derrida had shown @xcite that such a cutoff correctly represents the main effect of the noise on the velocity of the front . on top of that , in our model , there are some rare fluctuations consisting in a few particles randomly sent far ahead of the tip of the front , which upon further evolution build up a new front that completely takes over the old one . a positive correction to the front velocity",
    "was found , and the cumulants of the front position were computed ( see ref .",
    "+ in the present paper , we have considered a simple branching random walk , without any selection mechanism .",
    "we have used exactly the same ingredients as the ones conjectured in the model for stochastic fronts , namely deterministic evolution with a cutoff and fluctuations consisting in a few particles randomly sent ahead the tip of the front at a distance distributed exponentially .",
    "we were also able to arrive at a quantitative characterization of the fluctuations of the front in these processes .",
    "+ there are however a few important differences between the branching random walk and the stochastic fkpp front .",
    "first , the initial fluctuations are never `` forgotten '' in the brw case .",
    "this is because of the absence of a selection mechanism able to `` kill '' the front and let it be periodically regenerated by fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we could only compute the effect of the fluctuations on the front position between two large times @xmath58 and @xmath2 .",
    "next , while it was quite straightforward to define a proper front position in the sfkpp case ( as for example the integral of the normalized particle density from position say 0 to @xmath167 ) , it is more tricky for the simple branching random walk . we were led to consider the variables @xmath57 and @xmath22 ( introduced in sec .",

    "interestingly enough , the distribution of the positive values of this variable is identical ( up to an overall factor ) to the distribution of the front fluctuations in the sfkpp case .",
    "the same holds true for the distribution of @xmath260 to which we dedicate appendix  [ sec : z ] .",
    "we were also able to discuss the average of the position of the rightmost particle , but not its higher moments since they are sensitive to the very late - time fluctuations which are not properly described in our model .",
