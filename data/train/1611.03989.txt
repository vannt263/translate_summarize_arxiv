    "contrary to classical physics , in quantum mechanics physical observables or , in short , variables might not have definite values even if the full quantum description of the system is given .",
    "if the system is in a superposition or a mixture of eigenstates corresponding to different eigenvalues , then only an expectation value of a variable is defined .",
    "but since , in general , this value can not be measured given a single system , the expectation value is commonly associated with an ensemble of identically prepared systems and thus not considered as a property of a single system . if , however , the system is in an eigenstate of the observable , a measurement on a single system is enough to observe the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "it is therefore possible to attribute the eigenvalue to a single quantum system .",
    "again , contrary to classical physics , even if we have complete information about the preparation of a system , the outcomes of future measurements are in general not determined .",
    "the two - state vector formalism @xcite uses such future results to describe systems in between two measurements .",
    "it employs two quantum states , the usual one defined by the preparation and the backward evolving state defined by the result of the post - selection . for describing the coupling to variables of a pre- and post - selected system the concept of a _ weak value _",
    "has been introduced @xcite .",
    "it was accepted with harsh criticism @xcite , but its significance was appreciated in a number of experiments performing weak measurements in a regime of anomalous weak values achieving unprecedented precision in measuring small parameters @xcite .",
    "new proposals and experiments continue to appear @xcite .",
    "still , a controversy regarding the usefulness of anomalous weak values for parameter estimation and metrology compared to conventional methods based on strong measurements arose @xcite .",
    "moreover , even the quantum nature of weak values was questioned @xcite .",
    "weak values were introduced as outcomes of weak measurements @xcite , which have large uncertainty in the pointer position .",
    "thus , in experiments , the weak value is obtained as a statistical average of the pointer readings .",
    "even among proponents of this concept the weak value is frequently understood as a mere generalization of the expectation value for the case when the quantum system is post - selected , i.e. , a conditional expectation value @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we argue that although we obtain weak values from many measurement outcomes , they represent definite properties of single pre- and post - selected quantum systems .",
    "furthermore , we show that a weak value is more similar to an eigenvalue than to an expectation value .",
    "this holds when the system is described by a pure two - state vector and also when it is described by a _",
    "generalized two - state vector _ @xcite .",
    "in addition , we generalize the definition of weak values for genuine mixed pre- and post - selected states @xcite . evidently , then , but only then , the weak value has the nature of a statistical average .",
    "the weak value of a variable @xmath0 is defined for a single quantum system pre - selected in a state @xmath1 and post - selected in a state @xmath2 as @xmath3    in our analysis we stay within the framework of the standard quantum theory describing the system and systems it interacts with using wave functions only .",
    "we view the weak value of a variable of a system as a description of its interaction with other systems , i.e. , the way the pre- and post - selected system influences the quantum state of other systems .    while the definition of the weak value is based on the pure two - state vector with states @xmath1 and @xmath2 considered at a particular time @xmath4 , its operational meaning relies on interactions with other systems which create entanglement .",
    "the way to deal with this problem is by a delicate play of limits .",
    "we should consider a short period of time around time @xmath4 to evaluate the action of the system on other systems . the change in the other systems should be large enough to be seen , but the back action on the system should be small enough , such that the change in the two - state vector describing the system can be neglected .",
    "since we allow an unlimited ensemble of experiments with identical pre- and post - selection , the required limits are achievable .",
    "we start our analysis with a von neumann measurement hamiltonian coupling a quantum system to a continuous pointer system defined by its position @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a conjugate momentum to @xmath5 and @xmath8 is a coupling constant .",
    "we assume that at time @xmath9 , the system was prepared in state @xmath10 and shortly after , at time @xmath11 was found in state @xmath12 .",
    "for simplicity of calculations , we assume that the pointer at time @xmath9 is in a gaussian state @xmath13    for a comparison of different cases , we consider the pointer state after the interaction with the system and the post - selection measurement at time @xmath11 .",
    "let us consider a particle with the integer spin observable @xmath14 if , e.g. , the spin state is the eigenstate @xmath15 , i.e. the variable has the eigenvalue @xmath16 , then at time @xmath11 , independently of the result of the post - selection measurement , the pointer state is shifted : @xmath17 where we have set @xmath18 here and throughout the rest of the paper . if the system is not in an eigenstate of @xmath0 , the pointer state might also be distorted .    to compare various cases we evaluate the effect of the interaction by calculating the distance between quantum states expressed by the bures angle .",
    "the distance between the initial state of the measuring device ( [ phi0 ] ) and the final state ( [ phif ] ) is @xmath19 the amplitude of the additional orthogonal component is of the order of @xmath20 , but since our theoretical small parameter is @xmath21 , we take into account only the lowest order of @xmath22 .",
    "consider now a pre- and post - selected system with @xmath23 , but in which both pre - selection and post - selection do not include the eigenstate @xmath15 . a two - state vector which provides this weak value is @xmath24 after the post - selection",
    ", the state of the pointer variable is @xmath25 note that because @xmath26 , the distortion factor @xmath27 is almost constant relative to @xmath28 .",
    "therefore @xmath29 is effectively a gaussian centered around @xmath23 and is thus very close to @xmath28 as seen from the bures angle @xmath30    the characteristic distance between states after the interaction for the time @xmath22 is approximately @xmath20 , so when the additional distance is proportional to @xmath31 , it can be neglected .",
    "thus , in the limit of short interaction times , the pre- and post - selected system with some weak value interacts with other systems in the same manner as a system pre - selected in an eigenstate with a numerically equal eigenvalue .",
    "not only the expectation values of the positions of the pointers are essentially the same , but the full quantum states of the pointers are almost identical .",
    "the situation changes considerably when the system is only pre - selected in a state with the expectation value @xmath32 , which , however , is not the eigenstate @xmath15 . to show this ,",
    "assume that the particle is in the state latexmath:[\\[\\label{psi3 }    at time @xmath11 , now without post - selection , the pointer system is not described by a pure state , but by a mixture .",
    "the density matrix describing this mixture is @xmath34    the distance between @xmath35 and @xmath28 , the state of the pointer after coupling to an eigenstate ( [ phif ] ) , is @xmath36    this is a significantly larger distance than ( [ phi2-phi1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the distance ( [ overlap_mixture ] ) is of the same order as ( [ bures_weak ] ) and can not be neglected for small @xmath22 .    while the pointer states ( [ wvpointer ] ) and ( [ mixed ] ) correspond to similar probability distributions , they are fundamentally different . as in the case of an eigenstate ( [ phif ] )",
    ", the final pointer state ( [ wvpointer ] ) corresponds to a shift of the original distribution given by a single number , the weak value . in this sense , we call eigenvalues and weak values `` robust '' .",
    "the situation changes significantly when the system is prepared in a superposition of eigenstates .",
    "this results in an incoherent mixture of pointer distributions ( [ mixed ] ) , which can not be described by a single parameter anymore , but by several parameters , namely all eigenvalues corresponding to the superposed eigenstates .",
    "consequently , this pointer is in a statistical mixture of independent distributions in stark contrast to the other cases . in the above example ,",
    "the statistical character of the expectation value is reflected in ( [ mixed ] ) , which represents the mixture of two independent distributions centered around the eigenvalues @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    note that if we add post - selection on the original state ( [ psi3 ] ) , such that @xmath23 , then the coupling of the system to the external system converges to that of the system described by eigenvalue @xmath16 , again .",
    "the system evolves as in the eigenvalue case also when the weak value is anomalously large and lies very far from the range of the actual eigenvalues .",
    "it might be equal to an eigenvalue which is not present in the pre- and post - selected states , or it might be equal to a non - existing , `` hypothetical '' eigenvalue of the system , as in the canonical example @xcite .",
    "for example , a system described by the two - state vector @xmath39 has a weak value of @xmath40 .",
    "then , the distance between the states of the external system at time @xmath11 in this case and in the case when the system has an eigenvalue @xmath41 , @xmath42 is larger than ( [ phi2-phi1 ] ) , but still scales favorably with @xmath31 . as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ general ] , the resulting scaling order is not restricted to these examples , but holds in general .",
    "our claim that the system described by some weak value affects other systems similarly to the action of a system described by a numerically equal eigenvalue , but differently than a system described by a numerically equal expectation value , is tested experimentally .",
    "our system is the polarization degree of freedom of the gaussian light beam .",
    "the `` other '' or `` pointer '' system is the transverse position of the beam .",
    "the variable @xmath0 of the system includes the polarization operator @xmath43 , @xmath44 the coupling to this variable is achieved by passing the beam through a birefringent crystal which shifts the beam according to its polarization .",
    "we consider situations in which the weak value and expectation value equal @xmath37 .",
    "the operator @xmath43 has only eigenvalues @xmath45 , but effectively we can perform the experiment also for @xmath0 with the eigenvalue @xmath37 by removing the birefringent element from the beam or tilting it so that there is no shift .",
    "we start by preparing light in the state @xmath46 ; ( ii ) with the crystal , pre - selection only of the state ( [ pre ] ) with _ expectation value _ @xmath47 ; and ( iii ) pre- and post - selection of the same state ( [ pre ] ) with the _ weak value _",
    "@xmath48 .",
    "coupling to a state with `` eigenvalue '' @xmath37 causes no change of the state of the pointer system , meaning that the gaussian beam is not shifted , and @xmath28 has the form of ( [ phi0 ] ) .",

    "this difference is to perform an interference experiment between the reference beam and the beam distorted by the measurement interaction for the two other cases .",
    "it is based on the following simple relation between maximal obtainable visibility of the interference between two beams and the bures angle between their quantum states @xmath52 this formula holds when the visibility is maximal under variation of all parameters : alignment , relative intensity and - in the case of interference between pure and mixed state - unitary transformation of auxiliary degrees of freedom , the polarization in our case .",
    "it follows from the well known expression for the pure states , @xmath53 and from uhlmann s theorem @xcite about purification of mixed states .",
    "in our experiment we use a balanced mach - zehnder interferometer where the incoming beam is preselected in the specified polarization ( [ pre ] ) , see fig . [ setup ] . in one arm of the interferometer ,",

    "in this section we want to connect our results with the general literature on weak values which considers it as an outcome of weak measurements , and define a procedure for specifying the weak value for situations when the post - selection measurement does not specify the backward evolving state of involved systems completely . in such cases the system is described neither by a pure two - state vector , nor by a generalized two - state vector , nor by a mixed two - state vector .",

    "the density matrix representing the measuring device after the interaction is @xmath144 this mixed state is far from final state in case of coupling to the eigenvalue described by ( [ feig ] ) , which gives @xmath145    post - selection on the same state , which corresponds to the weak value @xmath23 , leads to coupling which is again similar to the coupling to the eigenvalue @xmath16 . the distance between the states of the external system in these cases is proportional to @xmath146 .",

    "the general expressions are also confirmed by the examples in the expectation value case .",
    "for example , considering the continuous pointer with @xmath148 , coupled to the spin @xmath147 in the initial state ( [ psi3 ] ) , yields the uncertainties @xmath154 plugging these into ( [ ex_scale ] ) results in an estimate of the distance consistent with ( [ overlap_mixture ] ) .",
    "for the coupling ( [ vnint ] ) to a continuous variable , the pointer wave function is `` shifted '' as in ( [ shift ] ) even if the weak value is complex .",
    "note , however , that the presence of the imaginary part in @xmath135 requires adding a normalization factor . to demonstrate this behavior we will consider coupling to the photon polarization ( [ polar ] ) with weak value @xmath155 obtained for initial state ( [ pre ] ) and the post - selected state @xmath156 the pointer state after the post - selection is @xmath157 while the state shifted by the imaginary  eigenvalue \"",
    "@xmath158 is @xmath159 straightforward calculation shows that the distance between these states is small , @xmath160    if the coupling is to a spin variable ( [ vnint2 ] ) instead of a continuous transverse degree of freedom , and we start again with the initial state of the measuring device @xmath128 , then the effective evolution of the spin is a rotation around the @xmath161 axis instead of the @xmath162 axis @xcite .",
    "it is approximately the same as the evolution under an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian in which the polarization operator is replaced by @xmath158 .",
    "the distance between the states in this case is @xmath163",
    "we want to prove the expression for the weak value ( [ wvm ] ) for a mixed two - state vector by deriving it from the basic definition ( [ wv ] ) . however , our procedure , fig .  [ mixed_diag ] , does not provide a pure backward evolving state even for the composite system which includes our system and the three ancilla systems . in order to resolve this issue",
    "we consider a verification measurement in the future , chosen such that it will have a definite result , thus providing the required backward evolving state .",
    "the act of performing this verification measurement can not change any measurable property at time @xmath4 . having a large enough pre- and post - selected ensemble of systems ( with their own ancilla systems )",
    "as described , the weak value of @xmath0 at time @xmath4 is a measurable property : the average shift of pointers weakly coupled at time @xmath4 to the systems in the pre- and post - selected ensemble . in the limit where the weak coupling does not change the evolution",

    "we prepare a maximally entangled state of ancillas @xmath106 and @xmath110 , @xmath166 .",

    "thus , the state of the system and the three ancilla systems evolving backward in time from @xmath109 is @xmath170 after evolving backwards through the bell - type measurement of @xmath106 and @xmath110 , the backward evolving state toward time @xmath4 is @xmath171 we have obtained a pure two - state vector of the system and @xmath105 at time @xmath4 with pre- and post - selected states given by ( [ pre_mixed ] ) and ( [ post_mixed ] ) . this allows to apply ( [ wv ] ) to find the weak value of @xmath0 @xmath172 this result reduces to the same expression as in ( [ gwv1 ] ) , which provides the proof of our general formula ( [ wvm ] ) .",
    "in our proof we have assumed that the verification measurement at @xmath164 effectively succeeds with certainty , which holds in the limit of vanishing interaction at time @xmath4 .",
    "this is enough for the proof since the weak value is defined at the limit , but the tiny probability for the failure of this measurement , which always exists , is crucial for the nature of the weak value of the genuinely mixed two - state vector .",

    "only the center of the affected pointer distribution shifts in the same manner as in the case of coupling to a system with a numerically equal eigenvalue .",
    "in fact , it is the same situation as for the system described by an expectation value , where after the coupling the pointer is in the mixed state ( [ ex_state ] ) . the mixture with a tiny probability of an orthogonal pointer state ( in case of the failure of the verification measurement )",
    "is equivalent to the mixture of almost identical states with comparable probabilities obtained via weak coupling to a system in a superposition of eigenstates ."
