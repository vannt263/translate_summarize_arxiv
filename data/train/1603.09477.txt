    "in minkowski spacetime , lorentz invariance is extended to accelerated observers on the basis of the assumption that an accelerated observer is pointwise inertial  @xcite .",
    "that is , at each instant along its world line , an accelerated observer is supposed to be momentarily equivalent to an otherwise identical hypothetical comoving inertial observer . according to this _",
    "hypothesis of locality _ , the accelerated observer thus passes through a continuous infinity of momentarily comoving inertial observers . to determine the measurements of the accelerated observer ,",
    "pointwise lorentz transformations can be employed in conformity with the locality postulate  @xcite .",
    "the locality postulate plays a crucial role in general relativity ( gr ) as well . to extend relativity theory to the gravitational domain",
    ", einstein postulated a certain local connection between an observer in a gravitational field and a corresponding accelerated observer in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the latter is locally inertial by the hypothesis of locality .",
    "therefore , einstein s principle of equivalence together with the hypothesis of locality renders observers in a gravitational field locally inertial  @xcite .",
    "the special theory of relativity can naturally treat pointlike coincidences of classical particles and rays of radiation , since such interactions are consistent with the locality postulate . on the other hand , classical electromagnetic field measurements are intrinsically nonlocal in accordance with the bohr - rosenfeld principle  @xcite . in 1933 , bohr and rosenfeld pointed out that only spacetime averages of classical electric and magnetic fields have physical significance , since these fields can not be measured instantaneously  @xcite . to go beyond the locality postulate for field measurements , one must therefore take due account of the past _ history _ of an accelerated observer . on this basis ,",
    "a _ nonlocal special relativity theory _ has been developed , where partial differential equations of the electromagnetic field , for instance , have been replaced by partial integro - differential equations , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein .    the fundamental connection between _ inertia _ and _ gravitation _ , originally elucidated by einstein  @xcite , provides the motivation to seek a history - dependent generalization of einstein s theory of gravitation .",
    "in such a theory , the gravitational field would be local , but would satisfy partial integro - differential field equations that would reduce to einstein s field equations in the local limit .",
    "einstein s general relativity ( gr ) is a field theory modeled after electrodynamics .",
    "maxwell s original equations involve field tensors @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the constitutive relation between these field quantities is in general nonlocal  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that gr has an equivalent formulation , gr@xmath2 , within the framework of teleparallelism .",
    "indeed , gr@xmath2 , the teleparallel equivalent of gr , is the gauge theory of the abelian group of spacetime translations .",
    "therefore , the field equations of gr@xmath2 bear a formal resemblance to maxwell s original equations of electrodynamics of media .",
    "thus gr@xmath2 can be rendered nonlocal in analogy with electrodynamics of media via the introduction of a scalar causal constitutive kernel  @xcite . in this way , one arrives at an indirect nonlocal generalization of gr .",
