    "approximately 2% of main sequence a - type stars are similar to @xmath0 boo in having essentially solar carbon , nitrogen and oxygen abundances but subsolar abundances of heavier elements such as iron @xcite .",
    "a plausible model to explain these distinctive abundances is that these stars have accreted gas but not dust @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "radiation pressure from the star prevents grains with their high opacity from accreting while gas is not so inhibited @xcite .",
    "although the general picture that @xmath0 boo stars acquired their distinctive abundances by selective accretion is promising , there are objections which must be resolved @xcite . for example , most @xmath0 boo stars do not exhibit an infrared excess @xcite .",
    "consequently , there is no evidence for either circumstellar dust or nearby interstellar dust . also ,",
    "main - sequence a - type stars with dust do not always exhibit @xmath0 boo photospheric abundances @xcite . seemingly , unless there is undetected dust , some additional mechanism to explain selective elemental accretion should be considered .",
    "the popular model for @xmath0 boo stars requires a substantial accretion rate . in particular , depending upon the amount of deep mixing and meridional circulation , required accretion rates range between 6 @xmath1 10@xmath2 g s@xmath3 and 6 @xmath1 10@xmath4 g s@xmath3 @xcite , comparable to the solar wind outflow of @xmath510@xmath6 g s@xmath3 . as described in detail below , these values are orders of magnitude greater than empirically - determined bounds on accretion rates by stars from the interstellar medium .",
    "therefore , the thin outer envelope must be acquired from an orbiting source close to the star .    a process that has been invoked to explain the anomalous circumstellar abundances of @xmath7 pic @xcite but not yet considered for @xmath0 boo stars is radiation pressure on individual ions .",
    "this effect is highly element specific and therefore may be important in explaining the abundance pattern in @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "if so , then dust need not be a constituent in the reservoir of the accreted material , allowing us to consider sources for accretion onto @xmath0 boo stars that were previously neglected .",
    "in section 2 , we examine and discard the possibility of interstellar accretion . in section 3 ,",
    "we assess the possibility that radiation pressure on atoms and ions can act to allow for selective accretion with the characteristic pattern seen in @xmath0 boo stars . in section 4 ,",
    "we assess various possible sources of the matter accreted onto @xmath0 boo stars and suggest that one unappreciated possibility is the wind from an irradiated hot jupiter .",
    "we discuss our results in section 5 and our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "@xcite used bondi - hoyle theory to compute interstellar accretion onto @xmath0 boo stars . because the applicability of this approach is uncertain , @xcite , empirical measures of accretion rates should be considered . a sensitive upper bound on the time - averaged rates of interstellar accretion onto stars",
    "can be derived from the amount of hydrogen found in the outer mixing zones of db white dwarfs , stars where the dominant element in the atmosphere is helium . because much or all of this hydrogen either had a circumstellar origin or was primordial @xcite , only upper bounds can be derived for the rate of interstellar accretion , @xmath8 . in a catalog of 57 dbs within 80 pc of the sun ,",
    "the time - averaged value of @xmath8 typically is less than or equal to 10@xmath9 g s@xmath3 @xcite .    for stars of mass , @xmath10 ,",
    "the bondi - hoyle accretion rate varies as @xmath11 .",
    "white dwarf stars typically have 1/3 the mass of a @xmath0 boo star @xcite , and therefore their accretion rates from the interstellar medium might be a factor of 10 lower .",
    "however , even making this adjustment , the time - averaged accretion rate inferred for db white dwarfs is nearly a factor of 10@xmath12 lower than the minimum required rate . because @xmath550% of the 34 @xmath0 boo stars discussed by @xcite lie within 80 pc of the sun and therefore within the local interstellar bubble @xcite , this comparison with nearby white dwarfs is meaningful .",
    "we also consider empirical measures of  instantaneous \" accretion .",
    "we therefore use measures of accretion rates onto da white dwarfs ( stars where the atmosphere is dominated by hydrogen ) that are warmer than 13,000 k where the settling time of heavy elements below the photosphere is only days @xcite . in a sample of 87 such stars ,",
    "the maximum carbon accretion rate is 2 @xmath1 10@xmath9 g s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "because solar abundances @xcite are assumed for the source material , @xmath0 boo stars are required to accrete carbon at a rate of 2 @xmath1 10@xmath13 g @xmath3 , a factor of 1000 greater than the maximum value measured for white dwarfs .",
    "the true discrepancy is probably substantially larger because the most likely source of the white dwarf s photospheric carbon is circumstellar rather than interstellar @xcite .",
    "we conclude that empirical bounds on interstellar accretion rates are much lower than what is required to explain @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "before exploring the different possible sources of accretion onto @xmath0 boo stars , we consider an additional element - sorting mechanism for sources that are dust - free .",
    "specifically , we extend models invoking radiation pressure on individual ions developed to explain the distinctive composition of @xmath7 pic s circumstellar gas to @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "following notational convention , we define @xmath7 as the ratio of the outward force of radiation pressure compared to the inner force of gravity .",
    "if the star has radius , @xmath14 , effective temperature , @xmath15 , mass , @xmath10 and emergent flux at the stellar surface , @xmath16 , then : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 denotes the charge of an electron of mass , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the speed of light , @xmath21 is the gravitational acceleration at the photosphere and @xmath22 is the mass of the @xmath23th ion with resonance transitions of oscillator strength , @xmath24 .",
    "we consider environments sufficiently far from the host star that ions mostly lie in their ground states .    qualitatively , using the wien approximation to the planck curve and assuming that in the ultraviolet the opacity is so high that we observe only the upper layers of the atmosphere and that the photospheric lines are weak , we write that : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the temperature minimum in the photosphere or @xmath5 0.75 @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "a low value of @xmath7 requires a low value of @xmath16 which requires that the resonance lines lie at relatively short wavelengths .",
    "important lines for c ii , n i and o i lie at 1335  , 1200  and 1302  , respectively , while , in contrast , important lines for mg , ca and fe lie at 2802  , 3933  and 2599  , respectively @xcite . therefore , c , n and o can be accreted while mg , ca and fe can not .",
    "this qualitative expectation is borne out by detailed calculations @xcite for a model of @xmath7 pic with assumed values of @xmath15 = 8000 k and @xmath27 @xmath21 = 4.2 , stellar parameters appropriate for many @xmath0 boo stars @xcite .",
    "we show in figure 1 a plot for @xmath0 boo of an element s abundance , compared to its solar abundance , @xmath28 , vs. the relative importance of outward radiation pressure , @xmath7 , where : @xmath29 there are two classes of elements : those with high values of @xmath28 and low values of @xmath7 in their likely dominant state of ionization and those with low values of @xmath28 and high values of @xmath7 .",
    "this analysis extend to elements beyond those considered in figure 1 . both h and s",
    "also are computed to have low values of @xmath7 and can be accreted while si and mn have high values of @xmath7 @xcite and would be inhibited from accreting , consistent with the general pattern of abundances among @xmath0 boo stars @xcite .",
    "one complication to this picture is that there are some elements , such as na , where @xmath7 can be high in one state of ionization and low in another .",
    "for such an element , the net balance among all the potential states must be determined in order to assess whether it is accreted .",
    "although there are uncertainties , we argue that outward radiation pressure on individual elements might play a key role in explaining the abundance pattern of @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "the alternative to interstellar accretion is accretion from some material gravitationally bound to the host star .",
    "we now assess different possibilities .",
    "a possible scenario to explain @xmath0 boo abundances is the accretion of the outflow from a stellar companion .",
    "in fact , there are rare instances of spectroscopic binary systems where two stars orbit close to each other and one star exhibits a @xmath0 boo abundance pattern @xcite .",
    "however , such situations probably do not explain most @xmath0 boo stars @xcite .",
    "a binary configuration of two more distant stars which might account for some @xmath0 boo objects would be an a - type star accreting from the wind of a late type companion . the typical mass loss rate from a late - type main - sequence star is @xmath5 10@xmath6 g s@xmath3 @xcite , comparable to the mass accretion rate required to explain @xmath0 boo stars . because the characteristic wind speeds from late type stars likely",
    "are near their escape speed of 600 km s@xmath3 , only a small fraction of the matter lost from the companion can be accreted by the @xmath0 boo star @xcite .",
    "therefore , accretion of winds from late - type stellar companions seems unlikely to explain most @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "the carbon to oxygen ratio measured in the atmospheres of @xmath0 boo stars typically is within a factor of three of the solar ratio @xcite .",
    "in contrast , most matter from rocky minor planets accreted onto white dwarfs has a carbon to oxygen ratio that is typically a factor of 100 lower than solar @xcite .",
    "this marked deficiency of carbon within extrasolar asteroids  the building blocks of rocky planets  argues against their being a major reservoir of matter accreted onto @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "another source of accreted material might be analogs to kuiper belt objects or comets with carbon to oxygen abundance ratios that might be nearly solar @xcite although perhaps not @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed that colliding comets explain the observed gas around 49 cet , a young main sequence a - type star .",
    "the suggested co production rate is greater than @xmath1 10@xmath30 g s@xmath3 , large enough to induce @xmath0 boo abundances .",
    "however , there are difficulties with this model .",
    "it is not clear how matter initially at @xmath31100 au ultimately accretes onto the host star .",
    "also , comets by consisting largely of water , may have very subsolar hydrogen to oxygen ratios .",
    "accretion of such material might produce an oxygen overabundance which is not observed .",
    "finally , 49 ceti has an infrared excess while most @xmath0 boo stars do not .",
    "given these objections , alternative reservoirs for the accretion onto @xmath0 boo stars should be considered .",
    "in the absence of accretion , mixing erases the abundance anomalies in @xmath510@xmath9 yr @xcite . while accretion from a primordial disk may lead to the @xmath0 boo abundance pattern measured in numerous pre - main - sequence stars @xcite , there are many @xmath0 boo stars that are sufficiently old that their photospheric abundances are not a relic from the era of their formation @xcite .",
    "a recent source of accretion should be considered .      because the source must be substantial and likely located relatively near the star to guarantee ultimate accretion ,",
    "we propose that the source of matter accreted onto many @xmath0 boo stars is the wind from a close - in planet . as an example , consider wasp 33 ( or hd 15082 ) , an a5 main - sequence star orbited by a hot jupiter with a period of 1.22 d @xcite .",
    "the mass loss rate from this planet may be 2 @xmath1 10@xmath30 g s@xmath3 @xcite , sufficiently high to explain @xmath0 boo stars .    here",
    ", we assume that all the mass lost from the planet ultimately is acquired by the star .",
    "furthermore , we also assume that individual ions can separate from the general flow as supported by a toy model not presented here .",
    "detailed calculations are required to assess these requirements .",
    "for example , in the case of the outer circumstellar gas orbiting",
    "@xmath7 pic , the effectiveness of the separation between different elements depends upon the viscosity in the gas @xcite .    in models",
    "where the upper atmosphere is heated by ultraviolet and x - ray photons , the wind rate , @xmath32 , from a planet at distance @xmath33 from the can star can be estimated as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitational constant , @xmath36 is the total stellar euv luminosity in the spectral range @xmath0 @xmath37 912  , @xmath38 is the planet s mean density , and @xmath39 is an efficiency factor to describe the conversion of incident radiative energy to kinetic energy in the outflowing wind @xcite .",
    "this formula may overestimate the planetary mass loss rate if the planet s magnetic field is sufficiently large @xcite .    now consider ",
    "optimistic \" values of the different parameters in equation ( 4 ) .",
    "we take @xmath40 of and @xmath38 for wasp 17b of 1.3 @xmath1 10@xmath2 cm and 0.062 g @xmath41 , respectively @xcite , the most inflated hot jupiter currently known @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath33 = 6.0 @xmath1 10@xmath2 cm in order for the planet to be stable against tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "we also take @xmath39 = 1 .",
    "because of attenuation in the interstellar medium , the euv luminosity of most stars is unobservable and therefore highly uncertain .",
    "indirect estimates of @xmath42 can be derived from observed subcoronal emission lines characteristic of gas with temperatures between 50,000 k and 300,000 k. such lines have been detected in stars with @xmath43 @xmath37 8200 k although stars as hot as 8800 k may possess coronae @xcite .",
    "further , approximately 10 - 15% of main sequence a - type stars are detected x - ray sources ; the underlying physical explanation is not known @xcite . here , to be specific , we consider for comparison the well studied star , @xmath7 pic , with @xmath43 = 8200 k @xmath44 150 k @xcite , a representative temperature for many @xmath0 boo stars . for @xmath7 pic ,",
    "the measured x - ray luminosity between 0.2 and 20 kev is 3 @xmath1 10@xmath45 erg s@xmath3 , and the extrapolated x - ray luminosity between 0.06 and 5 kev is 3 @xmath1 10@xmath46 erg s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "there must also be emitted photons with energies between 0.0136 and 0.06 kev . according to @xcite , the total chromospheric emission of @xmath7 pic is at least 9.9 @xmath1 10@xmath47 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "while much of this energy is emitted with @xmath0 @xmath48 912  , an appreciable fraction is thought to be emitted at @xmath0 @xmath37 912  . here",
    ", recognizing that there is great uncertainty , we adopt @xmath36 = 2 @xmath1 10@xmath47 erg s@xmath3 or @xmath49/l@xmath50 @xmath5 5 @xmath1 10@xmath51 .",
    "if so , then @xmath32 @xmath52 10@xmath6 g s@xmath3 , sufficiently large to explain @xmath0 boo abundances .",
    "one complication is that a hot jupiter may have a sufficiently short period that it can induce activity on its host star .",
    "@xcite have reported evidence to support @xmath510@xmath46 erg s@xmath3 of such dissipation .",
    "accordingly , through magnetically controlled interactions , the host planet might lose 10@xmath6 g s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , it is uncertain whether models developed for later type stars apply to a - type stars , but if they do , then the planetary outflow would be sufficiently great to explain many @xmath0 boo abundances .",
    "this model might apply to to hr 8799 , a main - sequence a - type star orbited by planets in wide orbits @xcite which is also is a  mild \" @xmath0 boo star @xcite . because hr 8799 emits 1.3 @xmath1 10@xmath47 erg s@xmath3 in the 0.2 - 2 kev band @xcite , a wind from a hot jupiter  an additional planet interior to those already known - might account for the photospheric abundances .    in this analysis",
    ", we assume that hot jupiters have an atmosphere with nearly a solar composition .",
    "although this result is unestablished @xcite , at least na and k have been detected in the outer atmospheres of hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "further , winds from hot jupiters display evidence for mg @xcite and possibly si @xcite .",
    "current data are consistent with the hypothesis that the abundances in the atmospheres of hot jupiters are similar to the material accreted on @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "winds from hot jupiters may be the source of accretion for many @xmath0 boo stars . for f , g and k stars ,",
    "the frequency of hot jupiters is 1.2% @xmath44 0.38% @xcite .",
    "although the frequency of hot jupiters orbiting main - sequence a - type stars is unknown , the fraction of stars with giant planets appears to peak for stellar masses near 1.9 m@xmath53 @xcite , and it is plausible that the frequency of hot jupiters around a - type stars is sufficiently high to explain many @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "if the wind from a hot jupiter provides the material accreted onto a @xmath0 boo star , then it may be possible to detect transits or more subtle photometric variations for systems inclined less than 90@xmath54 .",
    "@xcite has analyzed the kepler light curves for @xmath52000 a - type stars and found 166 candidate hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "further study is required to determine how many of these systems truly harbor planets .    in our proposal ,",
    "some of the elements in a wind from hot a jupiter are expelled into the interstellar medium by the star s radiation pressure and therefore mimic a stellar wind .",
    "this scenario might explain the observed outflow apparently from sirius @xcite which is not otherwise well understood .",
    "usually the wind speed is comparable to the escape velocity , and the modest blueshift of between -20 km s@xmath3 to -80 km s@xmath3 in the outflow attributed to sirius may instead be from a planet .",
    "one observational argument against our proposed scenario is that hd 15028  the host star of wasp 33 , an a - type star with a hot jupiter is classified as an am star @xcite and not a @xmath0 boo star .",
    "however , if the wind from the planet is magnetically funneled onto the host star , then perhaps elemental separations would not occur .",
    "it may be that only some winds from hot jupiters lead to the @xmath0 boo pattern of abundances .",
    "another observational argument against our model is that two @xmath0 boo stars identified in the kepler survey @xcite are not obvious candidates for harboring a hot jupiter @xcite .",
    "however , this sample is tiny and the result inconclusive . despite difficulties , the scenario of accretion from hot jupiters appears to be the least unlikely of all current proposals to explain @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "future observational tests of @xmath0 boo models can be performed with the well defined set of stars provided by @xcite .",
    "we argue that empirical bounds exclude interstellar matter as the source of accreted material onto @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "we then propose two modifications to the popular model to explain the abundance pattern in @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "first , we suggest that radiation pressure on individual gas - phase ions might be an important mechanism for selecting which elements can be accreted .",
    "second , we suggest that the matter acquired by some @xmath0 boo stars may originate in the wind from a hot jupiter .",

    "<S> therefore , a @xmath0 boo star s thin outer envelope must derive from a companion star , planet , analogs to kuiper belt objects or a circumstellar disk . because radiation pressure on gas - phase ions might selectively allow the accretion of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen and inhibit the inflow of elements such as iron , </S>",

    "<S> we propose that at least some @xmath0 boo stars accrete from the winds of hot jupiters .    </S>"
