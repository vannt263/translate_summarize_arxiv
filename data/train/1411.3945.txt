    "entanglement  @xcite , i.e. , correlations between parts of a quantum system that defy any classical description , lies at the heart of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is the basis for many applications of quantum information theory , such as quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum computing  @xcite , quantum cryptography  @xcite , and quantum metrology  @xcite .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of entanglement has been achieved by violating bell s inequality  @xcite with polarization - entangled optical photon pairs generated during spontaneous parametric down - conversion in a nonlinear crystal  @xcite . in many applications , it is desirable to have a source of entangled pairs of spatially separated particles .",
    "such pairs are called epr pairs in reference to the seminal work of einstein , podolsky and rosen on the completeness of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "compared to quantum optical scenarios , the generation of _ electronic _ epr pairs is rather challenging .",
    "epr pairs of electrons are nonetheless highly desirable because an on - demand generation of such pairs would facilitate certain quantum communication tasks in solid - state devices  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor provides a natural source for electronic epr pairs @xcite : the electrons in a bcs superconductor form spin singlet cooper pairs in the ground state .",
    "following theoretical proposals  @xcite , the coherent splitting of cooper pairs , originating from a superconducting electrode , into two spatially separated electrons on neighboring quantum dots ( qds ) has recently been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "while measurements of the current flowing out of the qds have indeed demonstrated the splitting of cooper pairs , the detection of the spin entanglement of the expected electronic singlet state has so far remained elusive .",
    "similar devices can be used as a tool to detect unconventional pairing in superconductors  @xcite or to entangle mechanical resonators  @xcite .",
    "detecting the entanglement of electronic epr pairs is not as straightforward as it is with their counterparts in quantum optics .",
    "several works  @xcite propose to violate a bell - type inequality with current noise measurements .",
    "however , this will require accurate measurements of the cross - correlations between the currents from the two qds .",
    "a measurable signal only emerges if these currents are large enough , i.e. , for a strong coupling of the qds to the measurement device ( `` open quantum dots '' ) .",
    "this conflicts with the requirement of isolating the qds from the environment ( `` closed quantum dots '' ) , which is necessary for splitting cooper pairs coherently in the first place .",
    "moreover , most existing proposals involve the use of strong ferromagnets and complex sample geometries , and neglect ( possibly long - range ) electron - electron interactions when computing the current - current correlations . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , such interactions can reduce the measured entanglement signal .",
    "another approach , which is closest in spirit to our work , is taken in  @xcite .",
    "these authors investigate the possibility to transfer electron spin entanglement to photon polarization states .",
    "these particular schemes however , suffer from a low detection efficiency and require the use of additional quantum resources to generate a pure two - photon state  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the possibility of generating polarization entangled photons in a superconducting p - n junction has been proposed  @xcite .    ]",
    "our proposal avoids the above difficulties by converting the spin entanglement of a _ single _ cooper pair into polarization entanglement of a _ single _ pair of optical photons and requires only classical resources such as laser drives and tunable gate voltages .",
    "because photons do not interact with each other , photonic entanglement is more robust to perturbations than electronic entanglement , and can be detected using standard bell - type measurements .",
    "provided sufficiently independent cavities are used ( see appendix .  [",
    "sec : effect - cavity - cross ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) , there can be no doubt that the entanglement ultimately measured stems from the split cooper pair because our entanglement transfer scheme involves only local operations .",
    "since our scheme does not involve the measurement of electronic currents , it works even in closed qds .",
    "finally , we show that the entanglement transfer can be carried out on time scales small compared to @xmath1 , the intrinsic coherence time of the qds ( see appendix  [ sec : typic - valu - param ] ) .",
    "let us first present our proposed experimental setup in more detail .",
    "a schematic drawing of a possible realization is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "our starting point is the typical setup for cooper pair splitters , i.e. , a superconductor which is tunnel coupled to two nearby qds @xcite .",
    "the spacing between the qds should be smaller than the superconducting coherence length and the qds are assumed to be in the coulomb blockade regime such that adding an electron to the qds requires a large charging energy @xmath2 .",
    "the onsite energies of the qds can be tuned via gate voltages . splitting a cooper pair into a singlet state shared between the two",
    "qds becomes energetically possible if the total energy of the singlet state coincides with the chemical potential of the superconductor .",
    "both qds are embedded into optical cavities that serve as frequency filters allowing only certain desired optical transitions .",
    "the small distance between the qds rules out conventional optical cavities , but photonic crystal cavities are nowadays easy to manufacture at the required length scales and can have optical linewidths and frequencies compatible with our proposal @xcite .",
    "moreover , cavities with high quality factors and directional out - coupling of photons into a narrow solid angle for high - efficiency collection have been fabricated  @xcite and self - assembled qds have been successfully embedded into photonic crystals in several experiments  @xcite .",
    "we will now present our scheme for transferring the spin entanglement of a cooper pair onto the polarization state of a photon pair . for simplicity",
    ", we discuss a left - right symmetric setup . to be specific , we assume that the qds are realized as self - assembled gaas qds . the relevant electronic levels are thus generated from the light - hole ( @xmath3 ) and heavy - hole ( @xmath4 ) bands forming the valence band , as well as the conduction band ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the energy difference between the hole bands @xmath6 is of the same order as the superconducting gap @xmath7 , whereas the transition frequency between the valence band and the conduction band is in the optical frequency range @xcite .",
    "moreover , we assume that a weak magnetic field is applied which causes a zeeman splitting @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) of all electronic levels .",
    "are occupied and transitions into them are forbidden because of the pauli principle ( hash marks ) .",
    "[ fig : setupschematics ] ]    the entanglement transfer can be split into initialization and three phases , which we discuss next . a schematic level diagram along with the essential steps of our scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setupschematics ] .",
    "_ initialization : _ initially , the gate voltages of the qds are tuned in such a way that the lowest light - hole states on each qd , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are occupied .",
    "furthermore the heavy - hole level resides in the superconducting gap but is detuned with respect to the chemical potential of the superconductor .    _ phase 1 : _ the splitting of a cooper pair is achieved by tuning the gate voltages to bring the heavy - hole level into resonance with the chemical potential of the superconductor .",
    "single - particle tunneling is suppressed due to the large superconducting gap .",
    "furthermore , the large onsite coulomb interaction in the qd suppresses the tunneling of both electrons of a cooper pair onto the same qd .",
    "the cooper pair splitting process , where one electron tunnels to each qd , is thus the dominant process  @xcite .",
    "when the separation between the qds is much smaller than the superconducting coherence length , the cooper pair splitting rate is ( see appendix  [ supp : sw ] ) @xmath12^{-1/2}$ ] . here , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) denotes the electronic tunnel amplitude between the superconductor and the left ( right ) qd and @xmath15 denotes the normal - state density of states of the superconductor . if @xmath16 , where @xmath1 is the intrinsic coherence time of the qds , this process is coherent and leads to rabi oscillations between the superconductor and the heavy - hole states on the qds .",
    "ideally , after half a period , the double - qd is occupied by a singlet state and the oscillation is stopped by detuning the heavy - hole level away from resonance .    _ phase 2 : _ next , the electrons in the qds are excited from the heavy - hole to the conduction band .",
    "this is achieved by switching on a strong drive laser on each of the two qds , with frequency @xmath17 .",
    "a linearly polarized drive can be used , which induces spin conserving transitions .",
    "after half a rabi period the laser is switched off , having lifted the singlet state into the conduction band levels .",
    "if the zeeman splittings of the heavy hole and conduction bands differ , one may use two drive lasers per qd to satisfy the resonance conditions for the two different transition frequencies simultaneously .",
    "the duration of this step is inversely proportional to the drive strength and can thus be made fast compared with @xmath1 .",
    "_ phase 3 : _ the resonance frequencies of the two optical cavities are chosen to be close to the transition frequency between the conduction band and the light - hole band , @xmath18 . furthermore , the cavity linewidth @xmath19 is assumed to be much smaller than the frequency separation between the light- and heavy - hole bands , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the decay of the conduction band electrons into the light - hole band due to the dipole coupling of strength @xmath21 between electrons and photons , will be strongly enhanced , whereas the decay into heavy - hole states is suppressed .",
    "since the lowest light - hole state @xmath22 is always occupied , a conduction band electron in the states @xmath23 or @xmath24 can only transition to the empty @xmath25 state via the emission of a linearly or circularly polarized photon , respectively .    to investigate these three phases ,",
    "we have numerically solved the schrdinger equation for the full system in the coherent limit @xmath26 ( see appendix  [ sec : numerical - simulation ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : combinedplot ] shows the evolution during each phase of the occupation of the electronic levels and the cavity mode for an optimal choice of the drive strengths and drive durations . in the limit @xmath27 , the emitted photons undergo coherent oscillations between the qd and the cavity .",
    "ideally , after half a rabi period @xmath28 , the electrons in both qds occupy the @xmath25 states while the electronic entanglement has been transferred to the photons .",
    "in a real experiment , the photons need to be extracted from the cavities for measurement .",
    "this is achieved by coupling each cavity to a continuum of modes , e.g. , as provided by a waveguide .",
    "hence , the cavity acquires a finite loss rate @xmath29 .",
    "as discussed further below , we will focus on the weak coupling limit , where @xmath30 . in this limit",

    "the electronic population is transferred from the heavy - hole band to the conduction band .",
    "once the conduction band is occupied the electrons can transition from the conduction band to the light - hole band by emitting photons into the cavity . at the end of phase three , marked by @xmath36 ,",

    "importantly , because of the finite linewidth of the electronic levels , the emitted photons are spread out in frequency .",
    "let us characterize the frequency overlap by @xmath44 . the normalization of the above photonic state @xmath45 is then given by @xmath46 . as we show next , the entanglement of the state  ( [ eq:25 ] )",
