    "since the seminal work by wigner  @xcite , phase space methods have attracted considerable theoretical attention .",
    "the interest in phase space methods has only increased over the years and it has found important applications in the fields of quantum optics  @xcite , atomic physics  @xcite , cold atoms  @xcite or other bosonic systems  @xcite .",
    "significant theoretical attention has been attracted by the semiclassical ( truncated wigner ) approximation of the full quantum phase space dynamics .",
    "the full quantum dynamics can be represented in terms of quantum jumps around the classical ( symplectic ) phase space flow . within the semiclassical truncated wigner approximation one",
    "neglects the quantum jumps .",
    "consequently the quantum dynamics is approximated by the classical evolution of the system .",
    "however , the initial state still caries the signatures of statistics into the time - dependent solution . the justification for this expansion around the classical trajectory",
    "is based on the observation that every quantum jump carries an additional factor @xmath0@xcite , which is obvious from the moyal expansion  @xcite of the wigner kernel  @xcite .",
    "the overall goodness of the expansion is however unclear , since each successive term in the moyal expansion contains higher derivatives of both the distribution and the hamiltonian .",
    "the modification of the classical mechanics by quantum fluctuations is however precisely the intuitive understanding associated with feynman s path integral description  @xcite of quantum mechanics . by adopting a saddle - point expansion  @xcite one can for example",
    "derive the semiclassical van vleck - gutzwiller propagator  @xcite . by construction ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations around the euler - lagrange equations associated with the saddle - point are minimal . in that respect",
    "it is important to note that the euler - lagrange equations for the saddle - point expansion of the wigner distribution propagator @xcite differ from the classical equations of motion , unless the problem is harmonic .",
    "although the classical equation of motion does lie on a saddle - point , there are infinitely many others such that it has zero measure in the semiclassical path integral .",
    "we therefore expect that there must exist a modified classical phase space evolution around which the overall quantum fluctuations are smaller .    in the next section we present a method for deriving an effective classical hamiltonian which generates a classical phase space evolution , that is optimal in a well - defined sense . in section  [ sec : quartic ] , the method is illustrated by finding this optimal hamiltonian for the case of a quartic oscillator which starts evolving from a gaussian wigner function .",
    "the result is shown to compare favorably with the standard truncated wigner approximation .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider a @xmath1-dimensional quantum system , whose initial state at time @xmath2 is represented by the density matrix @xmath3 under the influence of a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath4 the density matrix @xmath5 evolves unitarily as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the time - ordering operator .",
    "consider furthermore a set @xmath9 of trial density matrices @xmath10 all generated from the same initial @xmath11 but by other ( approximate ) protocols @xmath12 .",
    "it would then be interesting to find out how each of those protocols @xmath12 is performing by comparing @xmath13 to @xmath14 the goodness of a certain protocol @xmath12 can be assessed by measuring the distance @xmath15 between the two states underlying @xmath13 and @xmath16 a problem that is well established in the field of quantum information theory  @xcite .",
    "the optimal protocol @xmath17 is the one that generates the state closest to the real state , implying@xmath18 however , in quantum information theory the protocols are usually noisy approximate implementations of the ideal evolution @xmath19 from which one tries to find the optimal implementation . here",
    "we are concerned with a different type of approach . in quantum dynamics , the time evolution @xmath20 is usually analytically and/or numerically inaccessible . but soluble trial hamiltonians provide approximation schemes @xmath12 which allow to calculate @xmath21 the distance then provides a measure for the quality of each approximation . for this purpose",
    "we propose the hilbert - schmidt distance measure , i.e. , @xmath22   } , \\label{eq : optimalh : hilbertschmittd2}\\ ] ] since it is analytically better tractable than the more important trace distance .",
    "so far this is still completely general and one can put every possibly conceivable approximation in @xmath23 we now specifically turn to the problem of finding the optimal classical evolution of the wigner distribution in phase space .    the wigner distribution is a joint quasi - probability distribution of canonical conjugate variables , denoted by @xmath24 . although the wigner function has the correct marginal probability distributions , it is a quasi distribution as it can attain negative values .",
    "these negative values are the reason why one must use a quantum measure for the distance between states , rather than the classical kullback - leibler distance between the wigner distributions . denoting the wigner functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 associated with the states underlying @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , the hilbert - schmidt distance between the two states",
    "becomes@xmath29 initially this distance is zero , because then both compared states are equal . in order to assess the goodness of the classical approximation @xmath30 one should investigate the increase of @xmath31 over time .",
    "the time evolution of the exact wigner function @xmath32 associated with the unitary evolution @xmath33 is given by@xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the moyal bracket  @xcite , and where @xmath36 is the weyl representation  @xcite of the hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "the moyal bracket has the interesting property that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the poisson bracket",
    ". this expansion forms the basis of the semiclassical truncated wigner approximation  @xcite . by neglecting the quantum fluctuations of @xmath40",
    "the problem of propagating the initial wigner distribution in time becomes classical .",
    "the corrections around the poisson bracket are however higher powers of the poisson bracket . therefore , the overall quality of the approximation will depend on the smoothness of the distributions on which it acts .",
    "it is easy to show that the moyal bracket and the poisson bracket of any quadratic function with any arbitrary distribution equal each other . as a consequence the time evolution of any state under a quadratic hamiltonian is identical to its classical time evolution in phase space .    instead of approximating the time evolution of the system by its classical time evolution , consider a classical hamiltonian @xmath41 which differs from the original one .",
    "the corresponding state evolves according to @xmath42 although the full problem  ( [ eq : optimalh : wle ] ) is supposed not to be soluble , we can expand @xmath32 around the approximate solution @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath30 is the optimal approximation of @xmath32 there is no better way to estimate the real solution .",
    "up to lowest order , hence in the short time limit , we find that the distance between the two solutions grows with time according to @xmath43{c}\\left \\ {   h , f_{\\sigma}\\right \\ }   _ { m}\\\\ -\\left \\ {   h_{\\sigma},f_{\\sigma}\\right \\ } \\end{array } \\right )   \\right )   ^{2}.\\ ] ] the minimization of this distance results in the following requirement for the effective hamiltonian @xmath44 of the optimal classical evolution@xmath45 we would of course like to have the optimal solution for all final times @xmath46 moreover we would like the hamiltonian to depend locally on time , such that the approximate evolution ( [ eq : optimalh : le_approximate ] ) stays markovian .",
    "consequently we have to equate the previous expression time by time which yields the following euler - lagrange equation for the optimal hamiltonian@xmath47 since the approximate evolution has to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : optimalh : le_approximate ] ) , this equation can also be written as@xmath48 this implies that the equation of motion  ( [ eq : optimalh : le_approximate ] ) for @xmath30 differs from the equation of motion  ( [ eq : optimalh : wle ] ) of the true quantum system by an effective quantum jump distribution:@xmath49 if @xmath50 and if @xmath44 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : optimalh : euler - lagrange ] ) , the optimal trial distribution @xmath30 evolves classically .",
    "possible implications of this condition that the jump distribution and the trial distribution are in mutual involution are under current investigation .",
    "it is clear that eq .",
    "( [ eq : optimalh : euler - lagrange ] ) can not be solved in general . a possible way to simplify",
    "the problem is to parametrize the model hamiltonian in order to include specific additional physics . in this way",
    "the minimization of the distance will not result in a differential equation for the hamiltonian but it will give a set of algebraic equations for the undetermined parameters in the model hamiltonian .",
    "in @xcite we contributed to this possibility in the context of quantum transport . in that work we minimized the distance ( [ eq : optimalh : hilbertschmittdistance_f ] ) under the ansatz that the effective hamiltonian @xmath51 is parametrized by a scalar potential @xmath52    another option is to look for a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : optimalh : euler - lagrange ] ) for specific simple wigner functions .",
    "below we illustrate this approach for the quartic oscillator .",
    "although of limited practical interest , this example provides the required background for treating the contact potential in field theory .",
    "as an example , consider a one dimensional quartic oscillator@xmath53 expressed in natural units of the harmonic oscillator , i.e. , @xmath54 in this case the moyal expansion has a finite number of terms and becomes@xmath55 since the moyal bracket is expanded in the poisson bracket plus a correction , it is natural to expand the trial hamiltonian as@xmath56 in which @xmath57 accounts for the correction and satisfies the following partial differential equation@xmath58    as in any problem of quantum dynamics , the initial state has to given , and can by no means be calculated . because of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , a reasonable example of an initial distribution function is a gaussian wave packet in position and momentum .",
    "although many other trial time evolutions can be imagined , we here illustrate the optimization method for a displaced version in time of this initial wave packet:@xmath59 the condition @xmath60 accounts for the uncertainty relation . with this trial distribution function , the equation ( [ eq : quartic : hc_motion ] )",
    "becomes a inhomogeneous second - order partial differential equation in @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with the solution@xmath63 where @xmath64 is an arbitrary function .",
    "the poisson bracket of @xmath30 with this function @xmath64 always vanishes .",
    "therefore , one can set @xmath65 because it does not contribute to the dynamics .",
    "the optimal effective hamiltonian  ( [ eq : quartic : hc_define ] ) along these lines thus becomes @xmath66 from this effective hamiltonian one can calculate the effective jump distribution  ( [ eq : optimalh : f_jump ] ) , which turns out to vanish , i.e. , @xmath67 consequently the equation of motion ( [ eq : optimalh : f_jump ] ) of the trial @xmath30 is identical to the equation of motion ( [ eq : optimalh : wle ] ) of the true state @xmath32 .",
    "the non - linearity of the equations of motion will however distort the gaussian such that the ansatz state starts to deviate from the real state .",
    "the characteristics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : optimalh : le_approximate ] ) satisfy@xmath68 clearly the equations of motion for the average phase space position of the state become@xmath69 which for @xmath70 ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) reduce to the equations of motion of the real hamiltonian  ( [ eq : quartic : h ] ) . the latter equations , including the @xmath72-dependent term , express ehrenfest s theorem  @xcite .",
    "the restoration of ehrenfest s theorem is indicative of the gain made by propagating the classical trial system with the effective hamiltonian rather than the real hamiltonian .",
    "it should moreover be noted that , at least for the present example , the initial behavior of the distance is drastically different in both situations . within the truncated wigner approximation the initial distance will always increase linear in time .",
    "the slope is simply determined by the initial value of the @xmath73 correction to the poisson bracket in order to obtain the moyal bracket .",
    "so although the correction is of @xmath40 it does cause a discrepancy between the exact and the truncated distribution which increases linearly in time .",
    "the variational result however has vanishing corrections within first order , which implies that the initial increase in the distance is quadratic .",
    "the result is thus correct up to second order , i.e. , up to the deviation from gaussianity due to the non - linearity of the equations of motion .",
    "the curvature can not be estimated within the present approach but can be found by doing perturbation theory in terms of quantum jumps  @xcite around the variational state .",
    "finally note that the present effective hamiltonian can be used as an ansatz effective hamiltonian for the optimization of states that are not gaussian .",
    "the efficiency of course greatly depends on the shape of the state but if properly parametrized the initial time evolution can never be worse then the truncated wigner result .",
    "in conclusion we have presented a method to extract the optimal hamiltonian for the classical time evolution of the wigner distribution associated with the unitary evolution of an arbitrary initial state . in general",
    "this effective classical hamiltonian is different from the hamiltonian which generates the quantum dynamics .",
    "the effective classical hamiltonian was explicitly calculated for an initial gaussian trial state in a quartic oscillator . unlike in the truncated wigner approximation , the equation of motion",
    "was shown to be in agreement with ehrenfest s theorem and the quantum corrections around the result are of second order .",
