    "in a dual beam optical tweezer setup ( fig .  [ sys ] ) the protein is covalently connected to double - stranded dna handles that are attached to glass or polystyrene beads in two optical traps . for small displacements of the beads from the trap centers",
    "@xcite , the trap potentials are harmonic , with strengths @xmath3 along the lateral plane , and a weaker axial strength @xmath4 , where @xmath5  @xcite . for simplicity , we take both traps to have equal strengths , though our method can be generalized to an asymmetric setup .",
    "the trap centers are separated from each other along the @xmath6 axis , with trap 1 at @xmath7 and trap 2 at @xmath8 .",
    "as the bead - handle - protein ( bhp ) system fluctuates in equilibrium , the positions of the bead centers , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , vary in time .",
    "we assume that the experimentalist can collect a time series of the @xmath11 components of the bead positions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . denote the mean of each time series as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the trap centers are sufficiently far apart that the whole system is under tension , which implies that the mean bead displacements are non - zero , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean tension along @xmath6 .",
    "we focus on the case where there is no feedback mechanism to maintain a constant force , so the instantaneous tension in the system changes as the total end - to - end extension component @xmath18 [ fig .",
    "[ sys ] ] varies .",
    "though we choose one particular passive setup , the theory can be adapted to other types of passive optical tweezer systems  @xcite , where the force is approximately constant ( in which case we could skip the transformation into the constant - force ensemble described below ) .",
    "the mean tension @xmath17 , a measure of the overall force scale , can be tuned at the start of the experiment by making the trap separation @xmath19 larger ( leading to higher @xmath17 ) or smaller ( leading to lower @xmath17 ) . because @xmath20 , the precise relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath17 requires knowing the mean total extension @xmath21 , which depends among other things on the details of the energy landscape .",
    "hence , we can not in general calculate beforehand what @xmath17 will be for a given @xmath19",
    ". however , one of the advantages of our approach is that we can combine data from different experimental runs ( each having a different @xmath19 and @xmath17 ) to accurately construct the protein free energy profile .",
    "this combination is carried out through the weighted histogram analysis method ( wham )  @xcite ( see supplementary information ( si ) for details ) , in a spirit similar to earlier work in the context of optical tweezers  @xcite .",
    "we first solve the problem of obtaining the protein landscape based on a single observed trajectory of bead - to - bead separations specified as @xmath22 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the key quantity in the construction procedure is @xmath23 , the equilibrium probability distribution of @xmath22 within the external trap potential , which can be directly derived from the experimental time series .",
    "the imperfect nature of the measured data , due to noise and low - pass filtering effects in the recording apparatus , will distort @xmath24 , but we have developed a technique to model and approximately correct for these issues ( see finite bandwidth scaling ( fbs ) in the _ methods _ ) .",
    "once we have an experimental estimate for @xmath24 , the objective is to find @xmath25 , the intrinsic distribution of the protein end - to - end extension component @xmath2 at some _ constant _ force @xmath26 , whose value we are free to choose .",
    "( we will use tilde notation to denote probabilities in the constant - force ensemble . ) the intrinsic protein free energy profile is @xmath27 .",
    "the procedure , obtained from rigorous theoretical underpinnings described in detail in the si , consists of two steps :    1 .",
    "_ transformation into the constant - force ensemble_. given @xmath24 , we obtain the total system end - to - end distribution at a constant @xmath26 using , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a normalization constant .",
    "the equation above applies in the case of a single experimental trajectory at a particular trap separation @xmath19 .",
    "_ extraction of the intrinsic protein distribution_. in the constant - force ensemble , @xmath31 , relates the total end - to - end fluctuations @xmath32 to the end - to - end distributions for the individual components @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes bead ( b ) , handle ( h ) , or protein ( p ) , and @xmath35 is a 1d convolution operator . for the beads ,",
    "`` end - to - end '' refers to the extension between the bead center and the handle attachment point , projected along @xmath36 . in fourier space",
    "the convolution has the form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fourier transform of @xmath39 .",
    "here @xmath40 , which is the result of convolving all the bead and handle distributions , acts as the main point spread function relating the intrinsic protein distribution @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath40 can be modeled from a theoretical description of the handles and beads , we can solve for @xmath41 using eq .   and hence find @xmath43 , the intrinsic free energy profile of the protein .",
    "the derivation of the procedure ( given in the si , along with technical aspects of its numerical implementation ) shows the conditions under which the two step method works .",
    "the mathematical approximation underlying step 1 becomes exact if either of the following hold : ( i ) @xmath44 ; ( ii ) the full 3d total system end - to - end probability is separable into a product of distributions for longitudinal ( @xmath6 ) and transverse ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) components .",
    "in general , condition ( ii ) is not physically sensible  @xcite . however , if @xmath47 is the typical length scale describing transverse fluctuations , then condition ( i ) is approximately valid when @xmath48 .",
    "if this condition breaks down , accurate construction of the intrinsic energy landscape can not be performed without knowledge of the transverse behavior .",
    "however , in the simulation and experimental results below , the force scales are such that transverse fluctuations are small , @xmath49 , so to ensure condition ( i ) is met , we require that @xmath50 pn / nm at @xmath51 k. we use the experimental value @xmath52 in our test cases  @xcite , which is well under the upper limit . in principle , one can choose any @xmath26 , the force value of the constant force ensemble where we carry out the analysis . in practice , @xmath26 should be chosen from among the range of forces that is sampled in equilibrium during the actual experiment , since this will minimize statistical errors in the final constructed landscape .",
    "for example , setting @xmath53 , the mean tension , is a reasonable choice .",
    "step 2 depends on knowledge of @xmath54 , and thus the individual constant - force distributions of the beads and the handles in fourier space .",
    "the point spread function is characterized by : the bead radius @xmath55 , the handle contour length @xmath56 , the handle persistence length @xmath57 , and the handle elastic stretching modulus @xmath58 . in @xmath59 we also include the covalent linkers which attach the handles to the beads and protein .",
    "if we model these linkers as short , stiff harmonic springs , we have two additional parameters : the linker stiffness @xmath60 and natural length @xmath61 . using the extensible semiflexible chain as a model for the handles",
    ", we exploit an exact mapping between this model and the propagator for the motion of a quantum particle on the surface of a unit sphere  @xcite to calculate the handle fourier - space distribution to arbitrary numerical precision . together with analytical results for the bead and linker distributions",
    ", we can thus directly solve for @xmath54 . to verify that the analytical model for the point - spread function can accurately describe handle / bead fluctuations over a range of forces , we have analyzed data from control experiments on a system involving only dsdna handles attached to beads , where @xmath62 ( si ) .",
    "the theory simultaneously fits results for several experimental quantities measured on the same system : the distributions @xmath40 derived from three different trap separations , corresponding to mean forces @xmath63 pn , and a force - extension curve .",
    "the accuracy of the model @xmath40 is @xmath64 , within the experimental error margins .",
    "we first apply the theory to a problem for which the intrinsic free energy profiles at arbitrary force are known exactly .",
    "the generalized rouse model ( grm ) hairpin ( see si for details ) is a two - state folder whose full 3d equilibrium end - to - end distributions are analytically solvable .",
    "a representative grm distribution @xmath65 at @xmath66 pn is plotted in fig .",
    "[ grma](a ) .",
    "since @xmath65 is cylindrically symmetric , the top panel shows a projection onto the @xmath67 plane , while the bottom panel shows the further projection onto the @xmath11 coordinate .",
    "the two peaks correspond to the native ( n ) state at small @xmath11 , and the unfolded ( u ) state at large @xmath11 . in order to model the optical tweezer system , we add handles and beads to the grm hairpin , whose probabilities",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 ( including transverse fluctuations ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ grma](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the full 3d behavior is derived in an analogous manner to the theory mentioned above for the 1d fourier - space distribution @xmath70 of the beads / handles ; the only difference is that the transverse degrees of freedom are not integrated out .",
    "the 3d convolution of the system components , plus the optical trap contribution , gives the total distribution @xmath71 in fig .",

    "the handles provide the dominant contribution to both these effects .    figs .  [",
    "grma](e ) through ( g ) illustrate the construction procedure for the grm optical tweezer system .",
    "panel ( e ) corresponds to step 1 , with a transformation of the distribution @xmath71 ( whose varying force scale is shown along the top axis ) into @xmath76 at constant force @xmath66 pn .",
    "step 2 uses the exact @xmath40 , shown in real - space in panel ( f ) , and produces the intrinsic distribution @xmath65 , drawn as a solid line in ( g ) . the agreement with the exact analytical result ( dashed line )",
    "is extremely close , with a median error of @xmath77 over the range shown .",
    "this deviation is due to the approximation in step 1 , discussed above , as well as the numerical implementation of the deconvolution procedure .",
    "as shown in our previous study  @xcite , the smaller the ratio @xmath78 for the handles , the more the features of the protein energy landscape get blurred by the handle fluctuations . since the experimentally measured total distribution always distorts to some extent the intrinsic protein free energy profile due to the finite duration and sampling of the system trajectory , more flexible handles will exacerbate the signal - to - noise problem . to illustrate this effect",
    ", we performed brownian dynamics simulations of the grm in the optical tweezer setup , with handles modeled as extensible , semiflexible bead - spring chains ( see si for details ) . in fig .",
    "[ grmb](a ) we compare the free energy @xmath79 for a fixed @xmath80 nm and a varying @xmath78 , derived from the simulation trajectories , and the exact intrinsic grm result @xmath81 at @xmath26 . when the handles are very flexible , with @xmath82 , the energy barrier between the native and unfolded states almost entirely disappears in @xmath83 , with the noise making the precise barrier shape difficult to resolve .",
    "remarkably , even with this extreme level of distortion , using our theory we still recover a reasonable estimate of the intrinsic landscape [ fig .",

    "[ grmb](a ) , panel fig .",
    "[ grmb](b ) compares the result of the construction procedure and the exact answer for @xmath84 .",
    "clearly some information is lost as @xmath78 becomes smaller , since the @xmath85 system does not yield as accurate a result as the ones with stiffer handles .",
    "however in all cases the basic features of the exact @xmath86 are reproduced .",
    "thus , the theoretical - based method works remarkably well over a wide range of handle parameters .",
    "this conclusion is generally valid even when other parameters are varied ( see fig .",
    "s3 in the si for tests at various @xmath26 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "the excellent agreement between the constructed and intrinsic free energy profiles for the exactly solvable grm hairpin over a wide range of handle and trap experimental variables establishes the robustness of the theory .              to demonstrate that the theory can be used to produce equilibrium intrinsic free energy profiles with multiple states from mechanical folding trajectories",
    ", we performed simulations of a protein in an optical tweezer setup .",
    "the simulations were designed to mirror the single - molecule experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and to this end we studied a coiled - coil , lz26  @xcite , based on three repeats of the leucine zipper domain from the yeast transcriptional factor gcn4  @xcite ( see _ methods _ ) .",
    "the simple linear unzipping of the two strands of lz26 allows us to map the end - to - end extension to the protein configuration .",
    "furthermore , the energy heterogeneity of the native bonds that form the `` teeth '' of the zipper leads to a non - trivial folding landscape with at least two intermediate states  @xcite .",
    "the more complex landscape of lz26 thus provides an additional stringent test of the proposed theory .",
    "the native ( n ) structure of lz26 is illustrated on the right in fig .",
    "[ lz26 ] ( from a simulation snapshot ) , with the two alpha - helical strands running from n - terminus at the bottom to c - terminus at the top . in the experiment",
    "a handle is attached to the n - terminus of each strand , and this is where the strands begin to unzip under applied force . to prevent complete strand separation , the c - termini are cross - linked through a disulfide bridge between two cysteine residues .",
    "each alpha - helix coil consists of a series of seven - residue heptad repeats , with positions labeled a through g. for the leucine zipper the a and d positions are the `` teeth '' , consisting of mostly hydrophobic residues ( valine and leucine ) which have strong non - covalent interactions with their counterparts on the other strand . the exceptions to the hydrophobic pattern are the three hydrophilic asparagine residues in @xmath88 positions on each strand ( marked in blue in the structure snapshots on the right of fig .",
    "[ lz26 ] ) . as has been seen experimentally  @xcite ( and shown below through simulations ) , the weaker interaction of these asparagine pairs is crucial in determining the properties of the intermediate folding states , a point we will return to in more detail in the discussion .    in analyzing the lz26 leucine zipper system , we performed coarse - grained simulations using the self - organized polymer ( sop ) model  @xcite ( full details in the si , with selected parameters summarized in table  s1 ) .",

    "the four prominent wells in @xmath43 as a function of @xmath2 correspond to four stages in the progressive unzipping of lz26 . at @xmath91",
    "pn all the states are populated , and the system fluctuates in equilibrium between the wells .",
    "the transition barrier between n and i1 exhibits a shallow dip that may correspond to an additional , very transiently populated intermediate .",
    "since this dip is much smaller than @xmath92 , we do not count it as a distinct state .",
    "like in the grm example , adding the optical tweezer apparatus to the sop simulation significantly distorts the measured probability distributions . in the first row of fig .",
    "[ deconv ] sample simulation trajectory fragments are shown both for the protein - only case [ fig .",

    "[ deconv](c ) ] with @xmath94 nm . for the latter case we plot both @xmath0 ( purple ) and @xmath95 ( gray ) , allowing us to see how the bead separation tracks changes in the protein extension .",

    "[ deconv](b ) and ( d ) respectively . in fig .",
    "[ deconv](e ) , the distribution @xmath71 within the optical tweezer system is plotted for @xmath94 nm .",
    "though we only illustrate this particular @xmath19 value , @xmath96 trajectories are generated at different @xmath19 and combined together using wham  @xcite ( see si ) to produce a single @xmath42 at a constant force @xmath90 pn [ fig .",
    "[ deconv](e ) ] .",
    "we can then use our theoretical method to recover the protein free energy @xmath43 [ fig .",
    "[ deconv](f ) ] .",
    "despite numerical errors due to limited statistical sampling ( both in the protein - only and total system runs ) , there is remarkable agreement between the constructed result and @xmath43 derived from protein - only simulations .",
    "this is particularly striking given that the total system free energy @xmath97 , plotted for comparison in panels ( f ) , shows how severely the handles / beads blur the energy landscape , reducing the energy barriers to a degree that the n state is difficult to resolve .",
    "the signature of n in @xmath98 is a slight change in the curvature at higher energies on the left of the i1 well .",
    "however despite this , we still recover a basin of attraction representing the n state in the constructed @xmath99 .",
    "overall , the results in ( f ) show that our theory can accurately produce the intrinsic free energy profiles using only the simulated folding trajectories as input , thus proving a self - consistency check of the method for a system with multiple intermediates .      as a final test of the efficacy of the theory we used the experimental time series data  @xcite to obtain @xmath43 .",
    "the data consists of two independent runs with the lz26 leucine zipper , using the same handle / bead parameters for each run ( see table  s1 ) , but at different trap separations @xmath19 .",
    "we project the deconvolved landscape from each trajectory onto the mid - point force @xmath26 where the two most populated states ( i1 and u ) have equal probabilities in @xmath41 .",
    "the values of @xmath26 derived from the two runs are the same within error bounds : @xmath100 and @xmath101 pn .",
    "the detailed deconvolution steps are shown for one run in the last row of fig .",
    "[ deconv ] , and the final result , the intrinsic free energy profile @xmath43 , is shown for both runs in fig .",
    "[ deconv](h ) ( solid and dotted blue curves respectively ) .",
    "accounting for error due to finite trajectory length and uncertainties in the apparatus parameters , the median total uncertainty in each of the reconstructed landscapes is about @xmath102 @xmath103 in the @xmath11 range shown ( see si for full error analysis ) .",
    "the landscapes from the two independent runs have a median difference of @xmath104 @xmath92 , and hence the method gives consistent results between runs , up to a small experimental uncertainty , an important test of its practical utility .",
    "the reproducibility of @xmath43 is a testament to the stability of the dual optical tweezer setup , allowing us to sample extensively from the energy landscape : each trajectory lasted for more than 100 s , and thus collected @xmath105 of the various types of transitions between protein states ( the slowest transition , @xmath106 , occurred on time scales of @xmath107 s ) .",
    "comparison between the experimental @xmath43 in panel ( h ) and the simulation result in ( f ) reveals a notable difference : the landscape constructed using the experimental data does not have four identifiable basins .",
    "the n state may not be discernible in the experiment because of the limited resolution of the apparatus ( see below ) .",
    "the spacing between the i1 and i2 wells is similar in the simulation and experiment ( @xmath108 nm ) , but that between i2 and u is @xmath109 nm in the simulation versus 25 nm in the experiment .",
    "this is likely due to a larger helix content in the unfolded state for the simulation case .",
    "our theory for the point spread function @xmath110 can be used to understand the interplay of physical effects that relate the intrinsic protein distribution to the total system . to quantify the various contributions to @xmath110 , we calculated its variance .",
    "since variances of probability distributions combine additively upon convolution , we break down the variance of @xmath111 into the individual bead , handle , and linker contributions . fig .",
    "[ grmb](c ) shows the fraction of the variance associated with each component as a function of the handle elastic stretching modulus @xmath58 at @xmath91 pn , with @xmath112 nm , @xmath113 nm , @xmath114 nm ( the approximate experimental parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for any given value of @xmath58 ,",
    "the height of each of the four colored slices represents four fractions . though not directly measured in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have assumed @xmath115 kcal / mol@xmath116nm@xmath117 , @xmath118 nm for the linkers .",
    "the handle contribution is itself broken down into the `` elastic '' part , defined as the extra variance due to the finite stretching modulus @xmath58 , compared to an inextensible ( @xmath119 ) worm - like chain ( wlc ) , and the remainder , which we call the wlc part .",
    "for the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath120 pn . since the length extension relative to the wlc result is @xmath121 , we expect finite handle extensibility to play a small role . however , the elastic contribution to the total @xmath122 variance at this @xmath58 is 43% , comparable to the wlc contribution of 48% .",
    "hence , in predicting @xmath40 correctly it is important to account for both the bending rigidity and elasticity of the handles , which are exactly modeled in our approach .",
    "the folding landscape of lz26 is apparently closely related to the pattern of residue - residue contact energies between the two strands of the zipper  @xcite .",
    "sop simulations give us a detailed picture of this relationship .",
    "the average fraction of intact inter - strand ( `` zipper '' ) bonds vs. extension @xmath11 , in fig .",
    "[ lz26](b ) is a monotonic curve , starting with the fully closed structure on top ( n state , bond fraction near 1 ) to the fully open structure at the bottom ( u state , bond fraction near 0 ) .",
    "listed along this curve are the individual residues at the @xmath88 and @xmath123 positions of the heptads in the sequence .",
    "several features stand out : the transition barriers between the states show a steeper rate of zipper bond unraveling compared to the well regions .",
    "the change of slope from steep to more gradual descent occurs near the location of the asparagine residues in the sequence , and the the well minima of i1 , i2 , and u occur one or two residues after the asparagines .",
    "the correlation between well minima locations and asparagines agrees with the experimental landscape  @xcite , underscoring the importance of the weak , hydrophilic asparagine bonds that interrupt the hydrophobic valine / leucine pattern at the a / d positions .",
    "the sequence of rescaled bt  @xcite energies used for the a / d native contacts is plotted in fig .  [ lz26](c ) .",
    "the a / d bonds are all @xmath124 @xmath103 , except for the asparagines , which are less stable at @xmath125 @xmath92 .",
    "the difference in the number of wells in the simulation and experimental free energy landscapes of the leucine zipper is related to finite time and spatial resolution .",
    "the measured time series is subject to noise ( environmental vibrations of the optical elements , detector shot noise ) , as well as low - pass filtering due to `` parasitic '' effects in the photodiodes and the nature of the electronic amplification circuits  @xcite .",
    "the standard experimental protocol often involves additional low - pass filtering as a way of removing noise and smoothing trajectories : for the leucine zipper every five data points ( originally recorded at 10 @xmath126s intervals ) are averaged together during collection to give a time step of 50 @xmath126s  @xcite ; in other cases similar effects are achieved using bessel filters  @xcite .",
    "noise broadens the measured distribution of bead separations , while low - pass filtering narrows it .",
    "we developed the fbs technique ( _ methods _ and si ) , based on the details of the specific apparatus used in the experiment , to estimate and correct for the distortions .",
    "for our system , the fbs theory provides an excellent description , as we have verified in tests using both numerical simulations and experimental data ( with and without the additional filtering ) .",
    "however the fbs theory can only apply corrections to peaks ( i.e. distinct protein states ) that we observe in the measured probability distributions .",
    "there is the possibility of protein states leaving no discernible signature in the recorded distribution .",
    "the n state in the leucine zipper is only connected to the i1 state in the folding pathway . in the simulations , where the n state is directly observed , it has short mean lifetimes ( @xmath127 @xmath126s in the studied force range ) , and the @xmath128 change involves the shortest mean extension difference ( @xmath129 nm ) among all the transitions .",
    "if the n state in the actual protein has similar properties , it could be impossible to resolve it in the experimental data for two different reasons : ( i ) regardless of any additional filtering , the intrinsic low - pass characteristics of the apparatus filter out states with very short lifetimes . for our lot setup , the effective low - pass filter time - scale for the detectors / electronics is @xmath130 @xmath126s ( si ) , which is at the cutting edge of current technology .",
    "thus , states with lifetimes @xmath131 will not appear as distinct peaks in the measured distribution .",
    "( ii ) independent of the filtering issues in detection / recording , environmental background noise in the time series also poses a problem , particularly since we measure bead displacements , and these have signal amplitudes at high frequencies that are generally attenuated compared to the intrinsic amplitudes of the protein conformational changes .",
    "the reason for this is that the beads have much larger hydrodynamic drag than dsdna handles or proteins , and their characteristic relaxation times @xmath132 in the optical traps may be comparable to or larger than the lifetime of a particular protein state . the bead can not fully respond to force changes on time scales shorter than its relaxation time  @xcite . for example , @xmath133 @xmath126s in the leucine zipper experiment . if the lifetime of the n state at a particular force is much smaller than @xmath132 , protein transitions from i1@xmath134n@xmath134i1 will generally occur before the bead can relax into the n state equilibrium position .",
    "if the bead displacements associated with these transitions are smaller than the noise amplitude in the time series , the entire excursion to the n state will be lost to the noise .",
    "we can illustrate the finite response time of the bead using simulations where resolution is not limited by noise or apparatus filtering , allowing us to illustrate the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath95 , compared in two different trajectory fragments in fig .",
    "[ deconv](c ) .",
    "triangles in the figure indicate times where the protein makes a transition between states .",
    "changes in protein extension during these transitions are very rapid , and the bead generally mirrors these changes with a small time lag , as seen in the enlarged trajectory interval at @xmath135 @xmath126s . when the protein makes sharp , extremely brief excursions ( like a visit to the n state from i1 in the enlarged interval @xmath136 @xmath126s ) , the corresponding changes in bead separation are smaller and much less well - defined . in the presence of noise , such tiny changes would be obscured .",
    "thus , we surmise that the n state is not observable due to some combination of apparatus filtering , noise , and finite bead response time .",
    "hence , the theory applied to the experimental data produces a landscape with only i1 , i2 , and u wells , as opposed to the four wells produced from the simulation data .",
    "our labeling of the basins in the landscape agrees with the earlier state identification  @xcite , and provides an explanation for why the n state was not resolved .",
    "extraction of the energy landscape of biomolecules using lot data is complicated because accurate analysis depends on correcting for distortions due to system components on the measured result .",
    "we have solved this problem completely by developing a theoretically - based construction method that accounts for these factors . through an array of tests involving an analytically solvable hairpin model , coarse - grained protein simulations , and experimental data , we have demonstrated the robustness of the technique in a range of realistic scenarios .",
    "the method works for arbitrarily complicated landscapes , as demonstrated by the analysis of the leucine zipper experimental data , producing consistent results when the same protein is studied under different force scales .",
    "probability distributions derived from experimental time series of bead - bead separations are corrupted by noise , low - pass filtering due to the apparatus , and in some cases additional filtering due to the data processing protocol .",
    "we developed fbs theory to model and correct for these effects ( see si for details ) , using information encoded in time series autocorrelations , together with earlier spectral characterization of the dual trap optical tweezer detector and electronic systems  @xcite .",
    "all the experimental distributions @xmath71 in the main text were first processed by fbs .",
