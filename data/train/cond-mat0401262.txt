    "condensation transitions @xcite have been observed in a wide variety of nonequilibrium steady states @xcite . such a transition occurs when a single lattice site contains a finite fraction of particles of the system .",
    "condensation transitions are also manifested in a different guise in driven diffusive systems , where typically the particles obey hard - core exclusion . there",
    "the condensation appears as a transition from a freely flowing fluid phase to a jammed phase @xcite .",
    "such jamming transitions have been reported , for example , in the context of traffic flow modelling @xcite .",
    "a simple lattice model known as the zero - range process ( zrp ) @xcite illustrates an equivalence between condensation and jamming transitions and provides a framework within which condensation transitions may be analysed @xcite . in the model particles hop between lattice sites with rates which depend on the number of particles at the departure site .",
    "if the rates decay to zero or if they decay slowly enough to a finite value as the particle number is increased , one finds a condensation transition whereby a single lattice site becomes macroscopically occupied .",
    "the connection between condensation and jamming transitions was first made in the context of the bus route model @xcite where an approximate description assigns hopping rates to buses that decay as a function of the distance to the next bus ahead .",
    "if the decay is suitably slow a jamming transition arises whereby the buses cluster together into a jam and there is a large region of the bus route devoid of buses .",
    "this approximate description of the bus route model maps exactly onto a zrp where the buses correspond to the sites of the zrp and the number of bus stops in front of a bus corresponds to the number of particles at a site of the zrp .",
    "phase separation in driven diffusive systems may also be related to condensation transitions and the zrp has been used to formulate a general criterion for phase separation in one dimension @xcite .",
    "in addition to the condensation mechanism in the zrp described above ( condensation associated with hopping rates that are decreasing functions of the occupation of a site ) one can have condensation associated with _",
    "@xcite . here",
    "disorder refers to different sites having different hopping rates .",
    "the latter mechanism has been shown to be equivalent to bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple system that exhibits bose - einstein - like condensation is where there is one slow defect site at which a condensate forms at high enough density .    in the present work we study a simple model , with a single defect site , that exhibits features of both condensation mechanisms ( bus - route - like and disorder - induced ) mentioned above .",
    "the steady state can be solved and the critical density for condensation in the thermodynamic limit can be predicted .",
    "however , finite systems show significant deviations from these predictions . in particular , the low density , fluid phase appears to continue to higher densities than would be allowed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this results in an overshoot in the current , above the thermodynamic saturation value . related finite size effects",
    "have been reported in traffic flow models @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to analyse in detail how the finite size overshoot in the current occurs .",
    "now , since the zrp dynamics conserves particle number the natural ensemble to consider is the canonical ensemble .",
    "however , one finds that analysis of the model is more direct within the grand canonical ensemble ( i.  e.  where the particle number fluctuates ) .",
    "it has been shown that in the infinite system limit the two ensembles are equivalent @xcite . however , since we are interested in the behaviour of large but finite systems , we broach the issue of the inequivalence of the two ensembles on finite systems .",
    "we are able to analyse the single defect site model in both the canonical and grand canonical ensembles and find that they give different predictions for the finite size overshoot in the current .",
    "in particular , within the canonical ensemble the overshoot is predicted to peak at a density @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the thermodynamic critical density and @xmath2 is the number of sites , and we confirm this by simulations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we define the zrp and discuss the two types of condensation mechanism ; in section 3 we introduce the single defect site ( sds ) model and analyse the condensation transition within the grand canonical ensemble ; in section 4 we present exact numerical results and simulations that illustrate the overshoot of the low density fluid phase on a finite system in the canonical ensemble ; in section 5 we analyse the sds model in the canonical ensemble ; and we conclude in section 6 .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional , asymmetric zero - range process .",
    "we have a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath2 sites labelled @xmath3 , upon which reside @xmath4 indistinguishable particles , each site being able to hold any number ( @xmath5 ) of particles .",
    "particles move from site to site under a dynamics which conserves the number of particles and is described as follows : a particle from site @xmath6 hops to site @xmath7 with a rate , @xmath8 , which can depend on both the departure site , @xmath6 , and the number of particles on this site , @xmath9 .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic ; a particle hopping from site @xmath2 will hop to site @xmath10 .",
    "the configuration of the system at any given time is specified by the set of occupancies of each site , @xmath11 .",
    "thus we consider the zero - range process on a finite system of size @xmath2 ; in particular we shall be interested in the limit of large @xmath2 where the particle density @xmath12 is held fixed .",
    "the one - dimensional zero - range process , with particles hopping to adjacent sites in one direction only , has a steady state which is straightforwardly solved @xcite . requiring that there be no net flow of probability to or from a configuration ,",
    "one finds the probability of a configuration , @xmath13 , in the steady state to be @xmath14 where the @xmath15 are given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 has been introduced to ensure the probabilities are correctly normalised .",
    "this normalisation is analogous to the canonical partition function from equilibrium statistical mechanics , being the sum of the un - normalised probability over all allowed configurations , @xmath18 here we have summed over all occupancies for each site , from zero to infinity , and included the delta function to ensure that only those configurations with the correct total number of particles contribute . thus @xmath19 is the normalisation in the canonical ensemble .",
    "this steady state probability distribution can be used to calculate other steady state properties of the system . for our purposes",
    "the most important of these is the average hopping rate from a site , @xmath20 , which we refer to as the current . in the steady state",
    "this is independent of site and is given by @xmath21 where in the final step we have used the fact that @xmath22 ( the departure rate from an empty site is zero ) and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "depending on the chosen hopping rates the system can exhibit a condensation transition in the thermodynamic limit @xmath25 with the density of particles fixed . in this case , at low density the system is in a _ fluid _",
    "phase , by which we mean that all sites have average occupancies that are infinitesimal fractions of the total number of particles . on the other hand , at high density",
    "the system is in a _ condensed _ phase wherein a single site holds a finite fraction of the total number of particles .",
    "we shall show that there are two distinct mechanisms by which this may occur .",
    "the simplest approach to analysing the condensation transition is to use the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the functions @xmath26 given in ( [ marginalsf ] ) are only defined up to some multiplicative factor , @xmath27 , which we have tacitly set to one .",
    "reinstating @xmath28 , we can interpret @xmath28 as the fugacity .",
    "then we can get the equivalent of the grand canonical partition function in the usual way @xcite , by summing over all configurations , including those that violate the constraint on the total particle number , and then choose @xmath28 such that the average total particle number is equal to @xmath4 : @xmath29 the constraint on the average particle number is written as follows @xmath30 with the average occupation of each site , @xmath31 , being found as usual by : @xmath32 which yields @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the particle density @xmath35 .      to see the two apparently different mechanisms we analyse the behaviour of the rhs of ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the radius of convergence of ( [ bigf ] ) . as @xmath36",
    "one of two things can happen , either the rhs of ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) will converge , or it will diverge .    if the rhs of ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) converges at @xmath38 , then this will give a critical density , @xmath1 , above which ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) can no longer be satisfied .",
    "hence there is a phase transition , whereby the excess density condenses onto a single site .",
    "we refer to this as mechanism a.    if the rhs of ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) diverges at @xmath38 , then it is still possible to have a phase transition by a different mechanism . recall that each term in the sum in ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) is the density of particles at a site .",
    "it is possible for the rhs of ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) to diverge due to only a single term , say site 1 , of the sum diverging .",
    "this would imply that site 1 contains a finite fraction of the total number of particles , i.  e.  we have a condensate .",
    "we refer to this as mechanism b. to see that mechanism b is reminiscent of the bose - einstein condensation mechanism , one thinks of the particles as bosons and the sites of the zrp as bose states",
    ". then site 1 into which condensation may occur corresponds to the ground state of the bosonic system .",
    "the choice of hopping rates will determine which mechanism takes place .",
    "previously studied cases are :    1 .",
    "the hopping rates are the same for each site and decay with increasing particle number @xcite ; then we can have a condensation through mechanism a. 2 .",
    "the hopping rates do not depend on the number of particles at a site , but do depend on the site , i.  e.  the system is disordered @xcite .",
    "then we can have a condensation through mechanism b. one very simple realisation of this is a single defect site with a hopping rate less than the other sites . then at high density this site will support a condensate .",
    "one important difference between mechanisms a and b is that in a there can be a spontaneous symmetry breaking , in that the site supporting the condensate is selected at random . with mechanism",
    "b , on the other hand , the term in the sum which diverges specifies which site supports the condensate ( taken as site 1 above ) .",
    "if we have a mixture of decay and disorder in the hopping rates , then it is possible to have a phase transition through either mechanism . in the present work",
    "we investigate this possibility .      in the grand canonical ensemble the current",
    "is given by @xmath39 where to proceed to the final line we have used the fact that @xmath22 and @xmath40 for @xmath24 .",
    "thus in the grand canonical ensemble we have an equivalence between the current , @xmath20 , and the fugacity , @xmath28 . from the discussion of the behaviour of @xmath28 in the previous subsection we deduce that , in the _ infinite _ system limit",
    ", @xmath20 increases with density in the fluid phase until at density @xmath41 the current saturates at @xmath42 and we enter the condensed phase .",
    "however , on a large but _ finite _ system , things are more subtle . in mechanism",
    "b one can always solve ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) for @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath20 should always be less than its saturation value @xmath37 . in mechanism",
    "a , on the other hand , one can not satisfy ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) for @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "thus it is possible that @xmath20 overshoots the value @xmath37 @xcite . in simulations ( in the canonical ensemble ) of finite systems an overshoot in the current versus density diagram can be observed , i.  e.  the current appears to go above the expected maximum value before dropping back down at higher density ( see section  [ sec : numerics ] ) .",
    "thus on a finite system there can appear to be a continuation of the fluid phase into the region where , on the infinite system , one would expect a condensate .",
    "we now restrict ourselves to a very simple zrp with all hopping rates constant and equal , except for a single slow defect site which has a hopping rate that decreases for increasing particle number .",
    "we refer to this as the single defect site ( sds ) model .",
    "we begin by analysing the model within the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional lattice of @xmath46 sites with periodic boundary conditions from section [ modeldefn ] and now choose the following hopping rates ( for @xmath47 ) @xmath48 \\mathrm{u}_{\\mu } ( l ) & = & 1\\quad\\quad\\mbox{for}\\quad \\mu>1\\ ; ,   \\label{simplehopmu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 and we generally take @xmath50 , giving site 1 a hopping rate slower than all the others for occupancies @xmath51 . then from ( [ marginalsf ] ) @xmath52 \\mathrm{f}_{\\mu}(n ) & = & 1\\quad\\quad\\mbox{for}\\quad \\mu>1\\ ; , \\label{simplefmu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the pochhammer symbol defined by @xmath54 also , from ( [ bigf ] ) we have @xmath55 where the hypergeometric function @xcite is defined as @xmath56 to see the equivalence in ( [ bigf1stih ] ) note that @xmath57 .    if we look at the grand canonical analysis , specifically equation ( [ saddlepoint1 ] )",

    "this last condition ensures we are not in the condensed phase .",
    "however , for @xmath68 we must have @xmath69 finite to solve ( [ saddlepointsimple ] ) , thus we have a condensate on the slow site .    in order to determine the finite size corrections to the current @xmath70 we analyse ( [ saddlepointsimple ] ) for @xmath2 large but finite .",

    "[ 3animouts ] , width=453 ]    of course , on a finite system , strictly one can not identify thermodynamic phases .",
    "however , it is useful to think of putative phases emerging in large systems . in the following and",
    "figure  [ 3animouts ] ` phase ' is often taken to mean such a putative phase .    inspecting figure  [ 3animouts ]",
    "we see that the overshoot is initially an extension of the fluid phase ( figure  [ 3animouts]a ) ; up to the maximum of @xmath20 the system is still in the fluid phase . at the maximum",
    "a condensate begins to emerge on the slow site . in the range of densities just beyond the maximum of the overshoot the emergent condensate appears intermittently , but is not stable over long time periods ( figure  [ 3animouts]b ) .",
    "we interpret this as ` coexistence ' between the fluid and condensed phases , i.  e.  at any given time the system is in one or the other .",
    "eventually this coexistence gives way to a clear condensate as @xmath20 drops back down to its predicted maximum value of @xmath90 ( figure  [ 3animouts]c ) .",
    "having established what takes place in the overshoot region , we proceed in the next section to give an analytical account for this effect working within the canonical ensemble .",
    "the sds detailed in ( [ simplehop1 ] , [ simplehopmu ] ) , has a convenient property in that the canonical normalisation , @xmath17 ( [ bigzcanongeneral ] ) , can be reduced to a single sum .",
    "this makes it possible to analyse the model directly within the canonical ensemble .",
    "the form that @xmath17 takes for the sds model is @xmath122 here we have simply inserted the @xmath15 ( [ simplef1],[simplefmu ] ) into the general expression for @xmath17 ( [ bigzcanongeneral ] ) .",
    "the simple form of the hopping rates for sites @xmath123 ( [ simplehopmu ] ) allows the sum over @xmath124 to be performed easily , yielding the combinatoric factor which comes from the delta function in ( [ bigzcanongeneral ] ) .",
    "we also re - label @xmath125 as @xmath126 for convenience .",
    "the normalisation is the sum over all un - normalised probabilities of occupancies of the sites .",
    "this means that the magnitude of the @xmath127 term in the sum ( [ zcanon ] ) is proportional to the probability of the slow site having occupancy @xmath126 .",
    "thus if @xmath17 is dominated by a maximum at low @xmath126 , the corresponding system is in the fluid phase .",
    "conversely , if @xmath17 is dominated by a maximum at large @xmath126 , the corresponding system is in the condensed phase .",
    "if there are two maxima of similar magnitudes we interpret this as phase coexistence .",
    "thus investigating the maxima of this sum should furnish us with an explanation of the overshoot .    to investigate the maxima of this sum",
    ", we look for its stationary points , i.  e.  points where the ratio of two consecutive terms tends to one . solving for these points gives a quadratic equation in @xmath126 , the solutions of which are : @xmath128 +   \\frac{a}{2 }   { } \\pm   \\frac{m}{2 } \\left [ \\left ( { \\ensuremath{\\varphi}}- { \\ensuremath{\\varphi}}_{\\mathrm{c } }   \\right)^{2 } +   \\frac{1}{m } \\left\\ { 2 \\left ( { \\ensuremath{\\varphi}}- { \\ensuremath{\\varphi}}_{\\mathrm{c } }   \\right ) a -   4 \\lambda { \\ensuremath{\\varphi}}_{\\mathrm{c } } ( 1+{\\ensuremath{\\varphi } } ) \\right\\ } \\right . \\\\   \\left . { } + \\frac{1}{m^{2 } } \\left\\ {   a^{2 }   + 4 \\lambda { \\ensuremath{\\varphi}}_{\\mathrm{c } } \\right\\ } \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ; , \\label{nturningpts}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 is the expected critical density and the constant @xmath130 .",

    "thus the values of @xmath126 near @xmath134 dominate and this corresponds to the fluid phase . if we were to consider the @xmath66 limit of ( [ ph2 ] ) we would obtain @xmath149 .",
    "however for @xmath2 finite , the square root part of ( [ nturningpts ] ) remains imaginary up to @xmath150 and the system remains in the fluid phase until this point .",
    "thus the maximum at high @xmath126 emerges beyond the expected critical density @xmath151 by an amount @xmath152 : @xmath153 when @xmath34 is just greater than @xmath154 we interpret the boundary maximum at @xmath134 and the turning point at large @xmath126 as coexisting fluid and condensed phases .",
    "finally , for @xmath34 much larger than @xmath131 the maximum at high @xmath126 dominates and we interpret this as the condensed phase .",
    "we expect that the maximum of the overshoot will be near to the point @xmath154 as this is where a putative condensate can begin to form and reduce the current .",
    "we see that an amount @xmath152 beyond @xmath1 is consistent with the data from exact numerical calculation of the current ( figure  [ vdiffmfig ] ) .",
    "in fact , we compared the peak of the overshoot with @xmath154 for systems of size @xmath108 we found very good agreement for @xmath155 .",
    "outwith this range we believe that further finite size effects are becoming important .",
    "the form of @xmath17 , given in equation ( [ zcanon ] ) , also allows the behaviour of the current in the condensed phase to be analysed .",
    "one finds that the asymptotic behaviour of the current for large particle number ( i.  e.  where the sum in ( [ zcanon ] ) is dominated by a maximum at large @xmath126 ) is @xmath156\\;. \\label{vovercanon}\\ ] ] thus for @xmath106 the current approaches its asymptotic value from above as @xmath157 . it should be noted that the second term in the expansion is small only for @xmath158 .",
    "in this work we have studied the condensation transitions of a zrp with a single defect site , in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles .",
    "analysis in the grand canonical ensemble predicts the two different condensation mechanisms ( a and b ) discussed in section  [ mechsec ] . for @xmath78 mechanism",
    "a applies which predicts a finite size overshoot in the current .",
    "the approach of @xmath20 to its saturation value @xmath90 is @xmath159 . for @xmath76 mechanism b applies and there should be no overshoot .",
    "however , simulations in the canonical ensemble reveal an overshoot for all @xmath106 ; only for @xmath160 do we see the expected mechanism b behaviour .",
    "analysis within the canonical ensemble confirms this and predicts that for @xmath106 the overshoot in the current peaks at a density @xmath161 .",
    "the approach of @xmath20 to its saturation value as particle number increases is @xmath162 .",
    "thus it is not clear to what extent the mechanisms a and b are relevant or well - defined within the canonical ensemble .",
    "moreover , from the point of view of finite size critical behaviour , the two ensembles are not equivalent",
    ".    it would be interesting to further understand the finite size inequivalence of the ensembles . in order to shed some light on",
    "this one can follow a standard approach @xcite to evaluating the canonical normalisation ( [ bigzcanongeneral ] ) in terms of the grand canonical partition function ( [ zgce ] ) .",
    "we use the integral representation of the delta function to write the canonical normalisation as a contour integral in the complex plane @xmath163 then for large system size and particle number , @xmath2 and @xmath4 respectively , this integral will be dominated by its saddle point , given by @xmath164 where @xmath34 is the particle density ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this equation precisely recovers ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) .",
    "however it must be borne in mind that ( [ sad ] ) holds only when the saddle point of ( [ zint ] ) is _ valid _ , i.  e.  when it dominates the integral ( [ zint ] ) .",
    "it would not be surprising for the saddle point to break down when it approaches the radius of convergence of @xmath165 in a way that depends on system size , as in the analysis of ( [ saddlepoint1 ] ) in section  [ condgcesec ] .",
    "further analysis of this phenomenon would be enlightening .",
    "finally it would be of interest to perform simulations within the grand canonical ensemble to confirm our analytical predictions . to do",
    "this one would introduce transitions whereby particles are created and annihilated with appropriate rates .",
