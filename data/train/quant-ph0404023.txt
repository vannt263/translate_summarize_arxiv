    "quantum tunneling through nonstationary potential barriers is very unusual .",
    "the problem was addressed in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the method of complex classical trajectories was developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "recent achievements in semiclassical theory are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . see also the related papers @xcite . in refs.@xcite",
    "the advanced approach was developed to go beyond the method of classical trajectories and to obtain a space - time dependence of the wave function in semiclassical regime .",
    "when a nonstationary field is very small the penetration of a particle through a barrier differs hardly from a conventional tunneling described by the semiclassical theory of wentzel , kramers , and brillouin ( wkb ) @xcite . at a relatively big nonstationary field",
    "an over - barrier motion enters the game when a particle should absorb a number of quanta to reach the barrier top . in this paper",
    "we consider soft nonstationary fields with a typical frequency much less than the barrier height .",
    "this means that a particle has to absorb a big number of quanta to reach the barrier top . in the language of quantum mechanics",
    ", this corresponds to a high order of the perturbation theory when the probability is proportional to a high power of the nonstationary field .",
    "there are some intermediate magnitudes of a nonstationary field when neither pure tunneling nor pure over - barrier motion describes the penetration through a barrier . in this case , the real motion through a barrier is a combination of quanta absorption and tunneling .",
    "the particle pays in probability to absorb quanta and to reach the certain higher energy level but the subsequent tunneling is easier since it occurs in a more transparent part of the barrier . that higher energy is determined by a minimization of the total probability .",
    "this mechanism of barrier penetration in a nonstationary field is called photon - assisted tunneling .",
    "the physics of photon - assisted tunneling has no conflict with intuition since the pay in an absorption probability is compensated by the gain in a probability of tunneling . in photon - assisted tunneling through a triangular barrier",
    "two processes ( absorption and tunneling ) are weakly coherent which allows to consider them independently and , therefore , the total probability is a product of two partial ones .",
    "this reminds a static tunneling through two barriers , separated in space , when quantum coherence between them is artificially destroyed by some external source . in this case ,",
    "two processes ( tunneling and tunneling ) are also independent and the total probability is a product of partial ones .",
    "besides quanta absorption , resulting in the increase of particle energy , also quanta emission is possible followed by tunneling with a lower energy . at the first sight",
    ", this process can not lead to an enhancement of tunneling due to the double loss in probability ( i ) emission of quanta and ( ii ) tunneling in a less transparent part of the barrier ( with a lower energy ) .",
    "this conclusion is based on the assumption that quanta emission and tunneling are not strongly coherent processes which allows to consider them almost independently .",
    "the remarkable point of physics of nonstationary tunneling is that the processes of quanta emission and tunneling may be strongly _ coherent _ and can not be considered independently .",
    "moreover , the conclusion was drawn @xcite that emission of quanta and tunneling with a lower energy may result in a strong enhancement of barrier penetration .",
    "this conclusion is counterintuitive . indeed , intuition is sometimes useless in description of certain quantum mechanical processes .",
    "for example , the property of non - reflectivity of some potentials @xcite can not be established on the basis of general arguments .",
    "the strong coherence of quanta emission and tunneling is similar to the strong coherence of two stationary tunneling processes through a static double barrier potential . after tunneling through the first barrier the particle performs multiple reflections from the walls of two barriers and then tunnels through the second barrier . due to multiple coherent reflections",
    "two tunneling processes become strongly coherent and the total penetration probability dramatically increases if the particle energy @xmath0 coincides with one of the energy levels @xmath1 in the well between two barriers .",
    "the physical idea of this mechanism , called resonant tunneling , steams to wigner @xcite .",
    "the strong coherence between quanta emission and tunneling also results in a resonant effect and the penetration probability , as a function of a particle energy @xmath0 , has a sharp peak at the certain energy @xmath1 determined by dynamical characteristics .",
    "this effect is called euclidean resonance ( er ) @xcite .",
    "the difference between a stationary resonant tunneling through a static double barrier potential and euclidean resonance in a dynamical barrier is that the former requires a long time for its formation but the latter occurs fast .",
    "one has to emphasize that the frequency of a time - dependent field is much smaller than the barrier height and the amplitude of a time - dependent field is smaller that the static electric field . under these conditions the conventional tunneling and over - barrier transition would have very small probabilities which can be even classically small as , say , @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to this , under the er condition , @xmath3 , the peak in the energy dependence of probability becomes not classically small .",
    "the phenomenon of euclidean resonance can occur in any physical process where tunneling is a substantial part .",
    "in particular , er can be relevant in electron emission from materials .",
    "another example is alpha decay of nuclei which occur due to tunneling of alpha particles through the coulomb potential barrier of nuclei @xcite .",
    "an incident proton , colliding uranium nucleus , can stimulate alpha decay by its nonstationary coulomb field which leads to an energy exchange between the proton and the alpha particle @xcite .",
    "this constitutes a new type of nuclear reactions .",
    "the present paper addresses disintegration of atoms and molecules through tunnel barriers formed by coexisting constant and time - dependent electric fields .",
    "there are two different channels of such disintegration , electronic and ionic .",
    "the electronic mechanism is associated with ionization of a molecule into an electron and a positive ion .",
    "this can occur in a wide range of frequencies of a time - dependent field between 100  mhz and infrared .",
    "the ionic mechanism is due to dissociation of a molecule into two ions . since an ion is more massive than an electron , the necessary frequency is about of 1  mhz .",
    "amplitudes and a frequency of applied fields can be tuned to meet er condition for the certain electron binding energy ( electronic mechanism ) or for the certain ion dissociation energy ( ionic mechanism ) .",
    "this allows a very selective destruction of electron chemical bonds and a molecular dissociation only with respect to a given ion .",
    "this last mechanism provides a theoretical possibility of a new method of isotope separation by radio frequencies .",
    "the approach , used in the paper , is based on classical trajectories in imaginary time .",
    "this method enables to determine a probability of barrier penetration only in the exponential approximation ( without a preexponential factor ) but the method provides a `` bypass '' of a complicated quantum dynamics .",

    "[ fig1](a ) , which is @xmath4 at @xmath5 and is zero at @xmath6 .",

    "the total wave function under the barrier is a sum of two branches .",

    "suppose now that the barrier is not static since its slope is modulated in time @xmath13 and @xmath14 at @xmath6 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath15 is positive .",
    "when the frequency is big , @xmath16 , the probability of the barrier penetration becomes not exponentially small due to over - barrier excitation of a particle @xcite .",
    "a mostly interesting case corresponds to relatively small frequencies @xmath17 which are considered in the paper .      according to quantum mechanical rules @xcite ,",
    "the probability of absorption of one quantum of the field @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is of the order of the de broglie wave length .",

    "the simple separation ( [ 6 ] ) of the total quantum process into two independent mechanisms , generally speaking , is not accurate due to quantum interference between absorption and tunneling .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of triangular barrier this separation is correct @xcite .    at a very small amplitude @xmath15 of the nonstationary field eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) can be considered as a perturbative contribution to the total penetration probability . since @xmath24 ,",

    "the maximum relates to the balance between a lose of probability due to absorption and a gain of probability due to tunneling at a higher energy .",

    "this method was applied to investigation of photon - assisted tunneling in ref .",

    "the semiclassical description ( [ 8 ] ) is valid almost at all times and the wave function is of the type shown in fig .  [ fig1](b ) for the static case .",

    "[ fig3 ] by the thick solid curve .",
    "then , after an almost instant formation of the new branch , the semiclassical approach ( [ 8 ] ) recovers and the new branch in fig .  [ fig3 ] corresponds to the wave packet moving towards big @xmath39 .",

    "methods of perturbation theory break down but indicate that multiquanta processes become relevant . in this case , as shown in the paper , the barrier penetration is realized as an emission of outgoing wave packets at the moments of time when the barrier becomes of an extremal width .",

    "( [ 26 ] ) which is small but not classically small as the above numbers .",
    "the regime of euclidean resonance is extremely unusual since a classical potential barrier can be penetrated by particles acted by a time - dependent electric field of a frequency which is much less compared to the barrier height .",
    "moreover , an electron looses its energy and , at the first sight , seems to travel a longer way under the barrier .",
    "this contradicts to the traditional imagination of under - barrier motion , a quanta absorption and a subsequent tunneling , based on a weak coherence between these processes .",
    "the reason of this contradiction is that the phenomenon of euclidean resonance relates to a _",
    "strong _ coherence between electromagnetic interaction and tunneling when a separation of a total process into almost independent emission and tunneling is impossible .",
    "the method of classical trajectories in imaginary time , developed in the paper , enables to determine the magnitude of the effect with no detailed quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "this method provides a `` bypass '' of the complicated quantum dynamics including the regions where semiclassical approximation breaks down .    in the paper two tunneling mechanisms , electronic and ionic , of molecule destruction",
    "are considered . the electronic destruction ( ionization )",
    "relates to electron tunneling through a potential barrier , formed by a constant electric field , in presence of a time - dependent one . the ionic destruction ( dissociation )",
    "is associated with the analogous process participated by an ion .",
    "an ion is more massive than an electron and moves slower under the barrier .",
    "therefore a smaller frequency ( roughly 1  mhz ) is required for the ionic dissociation than for the electronic ionization ( more than 100  mhz ) .    in a complicated molecule",
    "one can selectively destroy a particular electronic chemical bond since er peak position depends on a binding electron energy .",
    "in addition to this , a selective ionic dissociation of molecules is possible by tuning external constant and time - dependent fields to a certain ionic motion .",
    "since a position of er peak depends sensitively on an ion mass this provides a theoretical possibility of a new method of isotope separation if to tune properly field magnitudes and a frequency .",
    "this method is unusual since radio frequencies of the order of 1  mhz have never been used for isotope separation .",
    "generally speaking , the phenomenon of euclidean resonance is applicable to a variety of phenomena where quantum tunneling is a substantial part of physical processes .",
    "in particular , one can consider a possibility of er application in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite , in molecular electronics @xcite , nanoscience , for tunneling chemical reactions @xcite , and for decay of zero - voltage state of josephson junctions @xcite . on the basis of euclidean resonance",
