    "in the last decade nanoplasmonics led to the emergence of many promising applications  @xcite .",
    "one of them is a near - field generator of nanolocalized coherent optical fields  spaser - based nanolaser or spaser ( surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ) , which was shown to be an optical counterpart of the mosfet ( metal - oxide - semiconductor field effect transistor )  @xcite . the device was proposed by d.  bergman and m.  stockman in the paper  @xcite .",
    "operation principles of the spaser - based nanolaser are similar to operation principles of the usual laser , but instead of photons we deal with surface plasmons ( sps ) .",
    "the first experimental observations were made by m.  noginov s group  @xcite and x.  zhang s group  @xcite and they are dated back to 2009 year .",
    "since the spaser - based nanolaser is a source of coherent light , it has a narrow spectral line width above the generation threshold .",
    "there are two main possible mechanisms which lead to the spectrum narrowing . for high q - factor resonators ,",
    "the narrowing is determined by the domination of stimulated emission of radiation and thus , by the large number of excited quanta in the resonator @xcite .",
    "this situation is typical for usual lasers .",
    "the opposite limit of low q - factor resonators and relatively small excited quanta corresponds to spaser operation @xcite . in the case",
    ", the narrowing can be determined by large number of the excited atoms in the gain media and their coherence , which is achieved by the mutual interaction of atoms through the resonator mode @xcite .",
    "here we show that the spaser - based nanolaser can produce narrow spectrum of generation even if the mean number of excited quanta in resonator is of the order or less than unity , and find the spectrum of the generation and its statistics .",
    "the exact analytical treatment of lasing involves quantum fluctuations , which are responsible for finite width of the spectral line  @xcite .",
    "description of the laser with maxwell - bloch equations , see e.g. @xcite , corresponds to mean - field approximation both for the resonator mode and atoms .",
    "we develop a theory which allows to account for quantum fluctuations in a low @xmath2-factor resonator with the arbitrary number of quanta both below and above the generation threshold , which interacts with ensemble of @xmath3 identical active atoms .    to solve the problem completely analytically we impose some restrictions .",
    "first , we assume that the cavity decay rate @xmath4 is the fastest rate in the system .",
    "thus , the resonator mode can be adiabatically eliminated  @xcite , and the state of the spaser - based nanolaser is fully characterized by the state of @xmath3 identical two - level active atoms .",

    "note that due to adiabatic mode elimination we can only resolve times @xmath6 .",
    "the smaller times were considered in the paper @xcite , for the model with single active atom , @xmath7 , but only below the generation threshold , when mean number of quanta in the resonator is well below unity .    as a result",
    ", we describe the behaviour of the spaser - based nanolaser below and above generation threshold , and demonstrate that the spectral line narrows considerably , when passing through the threshold .",
    "we find the average number of plasmons in the cavity and show that this number near the generation threshold can be of the order of unity . in the case",

    "the evaluation for the number of plasmons is in accordance with the experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we obtain second - order correlation function @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and find that above the generation threshold the amplitude fluctuations of polarization of active atoms lead to the damped oscillations in @xmath1 .",
    "a similar dependence was observed in numerical simulations in the paper  @xcite , and it is usual for bad - cavity lasers  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of good - cavity lasers there is no oscillations in second - order correlation function  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the shape of the curve @xmath1 indicates the mechanism of the spectral line narrowing , and therefore we investigate at what relationship between cavity decay rate @xmath4 and homogeneous broadening of active atoms @xmath9 the oscillations occur .",

    "thus , in order to spectral line width becomes narrower , the born plasmon should be coherent with the already dead plasmon , and this is possible since the active atoms preserve the coherence . originally arising plasmon interacts with active atoms and make them coherent to each other",
