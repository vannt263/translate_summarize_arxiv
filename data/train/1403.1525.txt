    "the low - lying eigenspace of operators has many important applications , including those in quantum chemistry , numerical pdes , and statistics .",

    "the low - lying eigenspace is given by the span of the first @xmath4 ( usually @xmath5 ) eigenvectors .",
    "in many scenario , the real interest is the subspace itself , but not a particular set of basis functions . in particular , we are interested in a sparse representation of the eigenspace .",
    "the eigenvectors form a natural basis set , but for oftentimes they are not sparse or localized ( consider for example the eigenfunctions of the free laplacian operator @xmath6 on a periodic box ) .",
    "this suggests asking for an alternative sparse representation of the eigenspace .    in quantum chemistry ,",
    "the low - lying eigenspace for a hamiltonian operator corresponds to the physically occupied space of electrons . in this context , a localized class of basis functions of the low - lying eigenspaces is called wannier functions @xcite .",
    "these functions provide transparent interpretation and understandings of covalent bonds , polarizations , _ etc .",
    "_ of the electronic structure .",
    "these localized representations are also the starting point and the essence for many efficient algorithms for electronic structure calculations ( see e.g.  the review article  @xcite ) .      in this work ,",
    "we propose a convex minimization principle for finding a sparse representation of the low - lying eigenspace .",

    "@xmath2 is an @xmath12 symmetric matrix , which is the ( discrete ) hamiltonian in the electronic structure context .",
    "the variational principle gives @xmath13 as a sparse representation of the projection operator onto the low - lying eigenspace .",
    "the key observation here is to use the matrix @xmath13 instead of the wave functions @xmath14 .",
    "this leads to a convex variational principle .",
    "physically , this corresponds to looking for a sparse representation of the density matrix .",
    "we also noted that in cases where we expect degeneracy or near - degeneracy of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath2 , the formulation in terms of the density matrix @xmath13 is more natural , as it allows fractional occupation of states .",
    "this is a further advantage besides the convexity .",
    "moreover , we design an efficient minimization algorithm based on split bregman iteration to solve the above variational problem . starting from any initial condition",
    ", the algorithm always converges to a minimizer .",
    "there is an enormous literature on numerical algorithms for wannier functions and more generally sparse representation of low - lying eigenspace .",
    "the influential work @xcite proposed a minimization strategy within the occupied space to find spatially localized wannier functions ( coined as `` maximally localized wannier functions '' ) .    in @xcite , the second author with his collaborators developed a localized subspace iteration ( lsi ) algorithm to find wannier functions .",
    "the idea behind the lsi algorithm is to combine the localization step with the subspace iteration method as an iterative algorithm to find wannier functions of an operator .",
    "the method has been applied to electronic structure calculation in @xcite .",
    "as @xcite shows , due to the truncation step involved , the lsi algorithm does not in general guarantee convergence .    as a more recent work in @xcite ,",

    "this @xmath15 regularized variational approach describes a general formalism for obtaining localized ( in fact , compactly supported ) solutions to a class of mathematical physics pdes , which can be recast as variational optimization problems .",
    "although an efficient algorithm based on a method of splitting orthogonality constraints ( soc )  @xcite is designed to solve the above non - convex problem , it is still a big challenge to theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed the algorithm .",
    "the key idea in the proposed convex formulation   of the variational principle is the use of the density matrix @xmath13 .",
    "the density matrix is widely used in electronic structure calculations , for example the density matrix minimization algorithm @xcite . in this type of algorithm , sparsity of density matrix",
    "is specified explicitly by restricting the matrix to be a banded matrix .",
    "the resulting minimization problem is then non - convex and found to suffer from many local minimizers .",
    "other electronic structure algorithms that use density matrix include density matrix purification @xcite , fermi operator expansion algorithm @xcite , just to name a few .    from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the use of density matrix can be viewed as similar to the idea of lifting , which has been recently used in recovery problems @xcite . while a nuclear norm is used in phaselift method @xcite to enhance sparsity in terms of matrix rank ; we will use an entrywise @xmath0 norm to favor sparsity in matrix entries .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we formulate and explain the convex variational principle for finding localized representations of the low - lying eigenspace in section  [ sec : formulation ] .",
    "an efficient algorithm is proposed in section  [ sec : algorithm ] to solve the variational principle , with numerical examples presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "the convergence proof of the algorithm is given in section  [ sec : proof ] .",
    "let us denote by @xmath2 a symmetric matrix coming from , for example , the discretization of an effective hamiltonian operator in electronic structure theory .",
    "we are interested in a sparse representation of the eigenspace corresponding to its low - lying eigenvalues . in physical applications",
    ", this corresponds to the occupied space of a hamiltonian ; in data analysis , this corresponds to the principal components ( for which we take the negative of the matrix so that the largest eigenvalue becomes the smallest ) .",
    "we are mainly interested in physics application here , and henceforth , we will mainly interpret the formulation and algorithms from a physical view point .    the wannier functions , originally defined for periodic schrdinger operators , are spatially localized basis functions of the occupied space . in @xcite , it was proposed to find the spatially localized functions by minimizing the variational problem @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the entrywise @xmath0 norm of @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the number of wannier functions and @xmath24 is the number of spatial degree of freedom ( e.g. number of spatial grid points or basis functions ) .",
    "the idea of the above minimization can be easily understood by looking at each term in the energy functional .",
    "the @xmath25 is the sum of the ritz value in the space spanned by the columns of @xmath14 .",
    "hence , without the @xmath0 penalty term , the minimization @xmath26 gives the eigenspace corresponds to the first @xmath4 eigenvalues ( here and below , we assume the non - degeneracy that the @xmath4-th and @xmath27-th eigenvalues of @xmath2 are different ) . while the @xmath0 penalty prefers @xmath14 to be a set of sparse vectors .",
    "the competition of the two terms gives a sparse representation of a subspace that is close to the eigenspace .    due to the orthonormality constraint @xmath28",
    ", the minimization problem is not convex , which may result in troubles in finding the minimizer of the above minimization problem and also makes the proof of convergence difficult .",
    "here we take an alternative viewpoint , which gives a convex optimization problem .",
    "the key idea is instead of @xmath14 , we consider @xmath29 .",
    "since the columns of @xmath14 form an orthonormal set of vectors , @xmath13 is the projection operator onto the space spanned by @xmath14 . in physical terms , if @xmath14 are the eigenfunctions of @xmath2 , @xmath13 is then the density matrix which corresponds to the hamiltonian operator . for insulating systems",
    ", it is known that the off - diagonal terms in the density matrix decay exponentially fast @xcite .",
    "we propose to look for a sparse approximation of the exact density matrix by solving the minimization problem proposed in .",
    "the variational problem is a convex relaxation of the non - convex variational problem @xmath30 where the constraint @xmath31 is replaced by the idempotency constraint of @xmath13 : @xmath32 .",
    "the variational principle can be understood as a reformulation of using the density matrix as variable .",
    "the idempotency condition @xmath32 is indeed the analog of the orthogonality constraint @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath31 requires that the eigenvalues of @xmath13 ( the occupation number in physical terms ) are between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , while @xmath32 requires the eigenvalues are either @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "hence , the set @xmath35 is the convex hull of the set @xmath36 therefore is indeed a convex relaxation of .    without the @xmath0 regularization , the variational problems and",
    "become @xmath37 and @xmath38 these two minimizations actually lead to the same result in the non - degenerate case .",

    "it is clear that the unique minimizer of is given by the projection matrix on the first @xmath4 eigenvectors of @xmath2 , given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the eigenvectors of @xmath2 , ordered according to their associated eigenvalues .",

    "this result states that we can convexify the set of admissible matrices .",
    "we remark that , somewhat surprisingly , this result also holds for the hartree - fock theory @xcite which can be vaguely understood as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "however the resulting variational problem is still non - convex for the hartree - fock theory .",
    "proposition  [ prop : equiv ] implies that the variational principle can be understood as an @xmath0 regularized version of the variational problem .",
    "the equivalence no longer holds for and with the @xmath0 regularization .",
    "the advantage of over is that the former is a convex problem while the latter is not .",
    "coming back to the properties of the variational problem .",
    "we note that while the objective function of is convex , it is not strictly convex as the @xmath0-norm is not strictly convex and the trace term is linear .",
    "therefore , in general , the minimizer of is not unique .",
    "let @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 the non - uniqueness comes from the degeneracy of the hamiltonian eigenvalues .",
    "any diagonal matrix @xmath13 with trace @xmath34 and non - negative diagonal entries is a minimizer .",

    "straightforward calculation shows that @xmath56 which corresponds to the eigenvector @xmath57 associated with eigenvalue @xmath33 and @xmath58 which corresponds to the eigenvector @xmath59 associated with eigenvalue @xmath34 are both minimizers of the objective function @xmath60 .",
    "actually , due to convexity , any convex combination of @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a minimizer too .",
    "it is an open problem under what assumptions that the uniqueness is guaranteed .",
    "to solve the proposed minimization problem , we design a fast algorithm based on split bregman iteration  @xcite , which comes from the ideas of variables splitting and bregman iteration  @xcite .",
    "bregman iteration has attained intensive attention due to its efficiency in many @xmath0 related constrained optimization problems  @xcite . with the help of auxiliary variables ,",
    "split bregman iteration iteratively approaches the original optimization problem by computation of several easy - to - solve subproblems .",
    "this algorithm popularizes the idea of using operator / variable splitting to solve optimization problems arising from information science .",
