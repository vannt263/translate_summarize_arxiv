    "in many ecological as well as biological systems biodiversity is realized despite the competition between different species for limited resources .",
    "it is therefore a fundamental problem in ecology to understand the mechanisms underlying biodiversity and its stability over time @xcite .",
    "models of predator - prey interactions , in which the survival of a species heavily depends on other species behavior , provide reliable means for studying the emergence of biodiversity . interestingly , these models have a direct relationship with evolutionary game theory @xcite . in the last few years systems with simple cyclic dominance of competing species",
    "have attracted wide interest as they provide a platform for investigating species diversity .",
    "most of these studies focused on cases involving three @xcite or four species @xcite in cyclic competition .",
    "thereby the emergence of spatio - temporal patterns in lattice systems , where fluctuations and correlations induce species co - existence , received special attention .",
    "more complex situations , involving either more species and/or more complicated interactions than simple cyclic competition , have been the subject of rather few recent studies @xcite",
    ". however , these more complex cases are obviously closer to realistic situations where in a given ecological environment multiple species are involved in a complicated food and domination web .",
    "the may - leonard model @xcite and its spatial stochastic version @xcite have yielded many important insights into pattern formation in the presence of cyclic competition . however , for more involved cases emerging spatio - temporal patterns as well as complicated coarsening processes have yet to be studied systematically . in two recent papers @xcite avelino _ et al _ introduced a set of models with @xmath0 species that possess a @xmath1 symmetry and discussed the appearance of intriguing pattern in two - dimensional lattice systems . in the present paper",
    "we discuss a related family of models composed of @xmath0 species and elucidate some of their characteristic properties .",
    "our aim is thereby to gain a better understanding of the complicated interplay between partnership and competition in a spatial environment occupied by more than three species .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we introduce our generalization of the stochastic may - leonard model , whereas in section iii we discuss a few selected cases that illustrate the very rich coarsening behaviors and spiral formations that can show up in this type of system . indeed , depending on the number of species and the chosen interaction schemes , very different spatio - temporal behaviors emerge , ranging from simple coarsening of compact domains to propagating wave fronts .",
    "more complex situations involve global competition between different alliances where members of each alliance prey on each other , yielding an intriguing mixture of coarsening process and wave front propagation .",
    "based on an analysis of the square of the adjacency matrix , we are able to predict the dynamics that is realized in a given system . in sections",
    "iv and v we present a more quantitative study of some of the aspects related to pattern formation .",
    "whereas in section iv we quantify through a temporal fourier analysis the dependence of particle densities on system parameters , in section v we analyze the time dependence of growth lengths and interface fluctuations for cases where coarsening processes take place . finally , in section vi we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "we consider in the following individuals of @xmath0 different species that live on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "each individual is mobile , can prey on individuals from some of the other species , and can give birth to off - springs .",
    "the events that are possible at each instant are determined by the local environment of the individual under consideration .",
    "denoting by @xmath2 a member of species @xmath3 sitting at a selected site , we can for the most general case capture the different events in the form of chemical reactions : @xmath4 the first two equations summarize the events when the selected neighboring site is unoccupied , as indicated by the symbol @xmath5 .",
    "in that case our individual can either jump to the empty site with rate @xmath6 or an off - spring is deposited on the empty site with rate @xmath7 .",
    "the last two equations , on the other hand , indicate the possible interactions if a member of species @xmath8 sits on the neighboring site : the two individuals then either can swap places with rate @xmath9 or , if species @xmath8 is a prey of species @xmath3 , the individual @xmath10 is removed from the neighboring site with rate @xmath11 and at the same time @xmath2 jumps to the newly unoccupied site .",
    "a modified version of the model can be obtained by imposing that at every moment every site is occupied by exactly one individual .",
    "due to the absence of empty sites , the reactions then simplify to @xmath12 so that predation and birth of an off - spring take place at the same time , with the mobility being reduced to the swapping of individuals on neighboring sites .    in the following we study a specific subclass of the very general model described by equations ( [ model1])-([model4 ] )",
    "( we will also briefly look at the corresponding simplified version given by equations ( [ model_singlesite1])-([model_singlesite2 ] ) at the very end when discussing interface fluctuations ) .",
    "we call model @xmath13 , @xmath14 , the generalized may - leonard model with @xmath0 species where each species preys on @xmath15 other species .",
    "this is done in a cyclic way , i.e. species @xmath3 preys on species @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( this has to be understood modulo @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xmath20 is therefore identical to the usual @xmath0-species rock - paper - scissors game where every species preys on a single species and at the same time is the prey of a different unique predator .",

    "species @xmath8 then has a preference to ally with the species that preys on most of its own predators , following the maxim that `` the enemy of my enemy is my friend . ''",
    "this preferred ally of species @xmath8 is directly obtained from the condition @xmath30 . in the next section",
    "we will discuss a range of non - trivial examples that illustrate the importance of the matrix @xmath31 .",
    "we first focus in the following on some cases with six and nine species .",
    "this allows us to discuss the typical scenarios and to illustrate how the matrix @xmath31 can be used to predict the dynamics of the system .",
    "we end this section with a discussion of expected scenarios for any number of species .    in our simulations",

    "in the initial state every lattice site is either empty or populated with a member of any of the @xmath0 species with the same probability @xmath34 .",
    "the number of empty sites rapidly decreases in the early stages of the simulation as every species _ feeds _ on the empty sites , thereby approaching rapidly a steady state value that depends on the chosen reaction scheme as well as on the values of the reaction constants .",
    "empty sites can not survive inside ordered domains because they are used by all species in the birth process .",
    "the only way to generate new empty sites is through predation between different species .",
    "this process only occurs near the boundaries separating different domains or spiral arms .",
    "all snapshots have been taken after 500 sweeps , where one sweep corresponds to selecting on average every lattice site once .",
    "for the predation and birth events the rates have been set equal to 0.2 , whereas for the exchanges between two individuals and the jumps of an individual to an empty site the rates have been fixed at 0.16 for interacting species and at 0.2 for non - interacting species .",
    "the emerging spatio - temporal structures are independent of the specific values of these rates , as long as these rates are the same for all species and are not zero .",

    "the corresponding adjacency matrix has entries 1 everywhere except for the zero diagonal elements .",
    "the square of that matrix is then given by @xmath36 for every column @xmath8 the maximum value is found at @xmath37 : the species @xmath8 does not want to ally itself with any of the other species , as all other species prey on @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , the members of species @xmath8 cluster around each other , see the snapshot in fig .",
    "we then have the typical situation of a coarsening process with six competing states , where smaller domains vanish at the expense of the larger domains .",
    "the domains are thereby very compact .",
    "this is very reminiscent of the coarsening process in a six - state potts model @xcite , especially at low temperatures where thermal fluctuations are small .",
    "in fact , we checked that the typical domain size increases as a square - root of time , as it is expected for a curvature - driven coarsening process .",

    "[ fig3 ] , title=\"fig : \" ]     model @xmath38 is characterized by the fact that for every species there is exactly one prey which is not at the same time predator of that species . in addition",
    "this prey is feeding upon all four predators of the species under consideration . as a direct illustration of the maxim that `` the enemy of my enemy is my friend , '' our species therefore prefers to closely follow this prey as this increases its chances of survival .",
    "this behavior is nicely captured by the square of the adjacency matrix @xmath39 from the first column follows that species 1 wants to ally itself with species 2 , the only one of its prey which is not at the same time preying on 1 , which itself would like to stay close to species 3 etc .",
    "hence the species try to make alliances in a cyclic way , which gives raise to the spatio - temporal pattern shown in fig .",
    "the order of the propagating wave fronts is thereby fixed by the matrix @xmath31 , i.e. species @xmath3 follows species @xmath16 , which follows species @xmath17 , and so on .",
    "these wave fronts are created in different parts of the systems , which leads to the shown complex pattern with propagating and annihilating wave fronts .",

    "[ fig4 ] , title=\"fig : \" ]     the case @xmath40 is a very interesting one as it combines coarsening of domains with wave fronts _ inside _ the domains , see fig .",
    "inspection of the matrix @xmath41 reveals the formation of two alliances , namely [ 1,3,5 ] and [ 2,4,6 ] .",
    "the species 1 , 3 , and 5 join forces in order to fight off the remaining species which are perceived to be the greater danger .",
    "this then yields a competition between two different domain types .",
    "however , within the domains , each species is paired up with both one of its prey and one of its predators . as a result a cyclic rock - paper - scissors game sets in within each domain , yielding an intriguing combination of domain coarsening and non - trivial internal dynamics .",
    "whereas for the case ( 6,5 ) discussed above smaller domains vanish because individuals are eaten up by the surrounding predators , in the case ( 6,3 ) the probable scenario is that inside a domain one of the predators is too successful and causes the extinction of its prey .",
    "if that happens then the remaining two species are also vanishing rapidly as they can not resist any more the pressure of the surrounding predators .",
    "it is therefore mandatory for the survival of the species inside each domain that they arrange themselves in a predator - prey relationship that is moderate enough so that no species is completely eaten up by its ally .",
    "this scenario can be captured by the maxim that inside the domain `` every species must do what is best for both itself and the alliance . ''",
    "[ h ]   is characterized by the emergence of three competing teams where each team is formed by two neutral , i.e. non - interacting , species .",

    "this again immediately follows from the matrix @xmath42 which implies the formation of three teams [ 1,4 ] , [ 2,5 ] , and [ 3,6 ] .",
    "consequently , we observe the formation and coarsening of three types of domains , each containing two mutually neutral species , see fig .",
    "the dynamics therefore is expected to be similar to that of the three states potts model .",
    "alliance formation and domain growth have also been observed previously in related six - species models where every species has two preys and at the same time is the prey of two other species @xcite .",
    "[ h ]   two teams are competing again each other , each team being formed by three non - interacting species .",

    "there has been some recent research effort aimed at fully characterizing the related four species model @xcite . as for the four species model ( or for any other model with an even number of species @xcite ) , two teams of mutually neutral species form for the six species case , as a quick inspection of @xmath43 reveals .",
    "this then leads to a coarsening process where two different types of domains , one containing the species [ 1,3,5 ] , the other the species [ 2,4,6 ] , compete , as shown in fig .",

    "in fact , in our opinion it is one of the most important features of the matrix @xmath31 that it allows us to immediately read off the order of wave fronts , especially for the more complicated cases .",
    "for the case ( 9,3 ) we have that @xmath47 which yields the relationships @xmath48 .",
    "what is special here is that every species tries to be involved in relationships with the two species with which it is not interacting . as an example consider species 1 . from @xmath49",

    "species 1 and 6 being mutually neutral , they tend to mix",
    ". a similar behavior takes place between 1 and 5 . however , 6 being a prey of 5 , this seems to be a bad arrangement for 6 as individuals from species 5 could simply switch places with those of species 1 in order to prey on 6 .",
    "species 6 avoids this by partially mixing with species 2 which is a predator of 5 .",
    "this complicated game of hide - and - seek results in the fuzzy looking wave fronts shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for the ( 9,3 ) case .",

    "if , on the other hand , @xmath58 , then spirals are formed .",

    "if @xmath61 , then spirals are formed with compact wave fronts that only contain one species , see the cases ( 9,4 ) and ( 6,4 ) .",

    "one of the most intriguing aspects of our family of models comes from the fact that we encounter three very different types of coarsening processes : ( 1 ) the coarsening of pure , compact domains formed by each of the @xmath0 species , as found for example in the case ( 6,5 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; ( 2 ) the coarsening of domains formed by different teams composed of mutually neutral species , see the case ( 6,2 ) in fig .",

    "the following we discuss some aspects of these different types of coarsening processes .",

    ", we are not dealing with compact clusters whose size can be easily determined .",
    "instead we proceed as in @xcite and determine the typical length in the system through a space- and time - dependent correlation function .",
    "note that the length determined in that way will follow the same growth law as the average domain size .",
    "we computed the following correlation function @xmath79\\ ] ] where the occupation number @xmath80 equals one if at time @xmath68 at position @xmath81 a particle of species @xmath3 is encountered .",
    "otherwise , @xmath82 .",
    "we thereby average over an ensemble of runs characterized by different initial conditions and different realizations of the noise .",
    "the length @xmath83 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] for different cases is then defined as the distance at which the correlation function drops to one third of the value it has at @xmath84 .",
    "[ h ] , as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "these data result from averaging over 3000 independent simulations for systems composed of @xmath64 sites .",
    "[ fig10 ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    we show in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] cases that correspond to the two most interesting types of coarsening where different teams formed by multiple species are competing against each other .",
    "whereas in the ( 9,2 ) case we are dealing with three teams each composed of three mutually neutral species , in the ( 6,3 ) and ( 9,5 ) cases two respectively three alliances , each composed of three interacting species , are in competition .",
    "for all cases the correlation length varies as a square root of time in the long time limit , as expected for a curvature driven coarsening process .",
    "our result for the ( 9,2 ) case is in agreement with the result obtained previously for the ( 4,1 ) model , where two teams composed each of two mutually neutral partners compete @xcite . the same growth law @xmath85 has also been observed in @xcite for systems with four and five species were the interactions yield the formation of compact single species domains . the main result of this section is therefore that also in cases with complicated dynamics inside the coarsening domains the square root growth law , with corresponds to a dynamic exponent @xmath86 , prevails .      in coarsening systems the most complex dynamical behavior is encountered at the interfaces separating different domains .",
    "for the two - dimensional ising model the interface fluctuations are known @xcite to belong to the so - called edwards - wilkinson universality class @xcite where after an early time regime the width of the interface , @xmath87 , increases as @xmath88 , whereas the equilibrium width increases with the interface length @xmath89 as @xmath90 .",
    "it is _ a priori _ unclear whether for the multi - species models studied in this paper the interfaces separating different competing teams belong to the same universality class . in @xcite",
    "we provided a first answer to that question through of study of the interface fluctuation of the simple case ( 4,1 ) where the coarsening domains are formed by teams of two mutually neutral species .",
    "indeed , we showed in that work that we recover the same power - laws as for the two - dimensional ising model , thereby demonstrating that these interface fluctuations also belong to the edwards - wilkinson university class . the same result is expected for every case where the team members are not interacting .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether the same conclusions can be drawn for the more complex cases where inside the domains predation takes place between the members of a team .",
    "this is the question we want to address in the following through an investigation of the ( 6,3 ) model .",
    "we thereby focus on a version without empty sites given by the reactions ( [ model_singlesite1 ] ) and ( [ model_singlesite2 ] ) , i.e. predation and birth are taking place simultaneously and mobility is exclusively realized through the swapping of particles sitting on neighboring sites ( note that the spirals seen in fig .",

    "this regime , which is not observed for the ising model or the ( 4,1 ) model @xcite , indicates that the complicated interplay between the different species at the interface yields initial correlated fluctuations characterized by the growth exponent of the kardar - parisi - zhang universality class @xcite .",
    "this regime , however , is only transient , as it is followed by a long - time regime where @xmath88 , in agreement with what has been found for the simpler ( 4,1 ) case .",
    "in addition , we find that the equilibrium interface width scales with the system length as @xmath112 , so that these two exponents agree with the expected values for the edwards - wilkinson universality class .",
    "we also studied a version of the ( 6,3 ) model where for the team in the lower half no predation among team members was allowed , yielding a team of mutually neutral partners , see the lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . analyzing the interface width for that case ,",
    "[ fig12]b , we find that the transient regime is absent for this simplified dynamics and that the edwards - wilkinson regime immediately sets in after the uncorrelated early time regime .",
    "this difference in behavior can be rationalized by noting that for the full model patches of a given species enter into the part of the system that is occupied by the other alliance .",
    "as our species preys on two of the species in the enemy team , it usually finds many preys in the form of patches composed by these two species .",
    "however , as soon as it encounters a patch of the only enemy species upon which it does not prey , our patch will disappear rapidly as it is a prey of this third species . this repeating process yields large correlated fluctuations which are mostly absent for the simplified model where no large patches are formed in the lower half , see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "in spatial systems and in the presence of noise biodiversity and species coexistence often go hand in hand with complex spatio - temporal patterns . this relationship has been studied extensively in recent years for population models composed of a few ( typically two or three ) species .",
    "well known examples include stochastic two - species lotka - volterra ( predator - prey ) models @xcite or stochastic versions of the three - species spatial may - leonard model @xcite .",
    "although important lessons can be learned from these systems with very few species , they are oversimplified as real ecosystems are not composed by such a small number of species that do not interact with the outside world . on the other hand , increasing substantially the number of species in order to describe more realistic food webs or ecological networks @xcite very rapidly yields extremely complex systems that can not be studied in the same systematic way as the few species models .    one promising avenue , intermediate between the simplest models and the large food webs , is to study systems composed of many species that interact in very specific ways among each other .",
    "this is the approach taken in this paper ( see also @xcite for other recent examples ) .",
    "we thereby focus on systems composed of @xmath0 species , where every species preys on @xmath15 other species in a cyclic way . in this way",
    "we recover the @xmath0-species cyclic lotka - volterra models as special cases .",
    "our study reveals a richness of pattern formation not discussed in previous publications .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath15 , various scenarios are encountered .",
    "for example , different types of space - time patterns in the form of spirals can emerge .",
    "these spirals can be compact , i.e. formed by a single species , or they can be fuzzy , due to the interpenetration of members belonging to different species .",
    "there are also three fundamentally different coarsening processes that can be realized .",
    "whereas in the first one , which is encountered when every species preys on every other species , pure domains are formed that contain only members of a single species , in a second case we end up with different teams , composed of mutually neutral species , that compete against each other .",
    "the third possibility is a very intriguing one , as here alliances are formed , where the different members of the alliances are not mutually neutral , but are involved in a predator - prey relationship .",
    "consequently , one observes coarsening domains with non - trivial spirals forming _ inside _ the domains .",
    "remarkably , the different scenarios can be reliably predicted by analyzing the square of the adjacency matrix .",
    "indeed , this matrix not only allows to read off the composition of the different alliances during coarsening , it also allows to understand the order of the wave fronts when spirals are formed .",
    "based on an analysis of this matrix , we have written down the conditions that allow to predict the fate of every system that can be realized in the large class of models discussed in this paper .    from a more quantitative point of view , we studied the time - dependent oscillations that show up in the population densities , and this both for systems exhibiting spirals and for systems undergoing coarsening . for all cases ,",
    "the fourier spectrum is characterized by a rather broad peak , but higher harmonics of the characteristic frequency of the peak location can also be observed .",
    "interestingly , the characteristic frequency increases logarithmically with the predation and with the birth rates . additional important insights should result from a corresponding analysis of time- and space - dependent density profiles , which we leave for a future study .",
    "coarsening processes usually give rise to algebraic dependencies of various quantities on time .",
    "we first computed space - time correlations and extracted from these data the growth law of the characteristic length @xmath83 in the system .",
    "for the cases of coarsening of pure domains or of domains composed of teams of mutually neutral partners we found a square root behavior of this length as a function of time , thus confirming the presence of this algebraic law in systems with a larger number of species than the few four and five species cases discussed in recent publications @xcite .",
    "interestingly , even when the members of an alliance are themselves in a predator - prey relationship , thus yielding complex dynamics within the coarsening domains , we find an algebraic growth with the same exponent : @xmath85 .",
    "we also presented a study of the interface fluctuations for the ( 6,3 ) case where we have non - trivial dynamics within the coarsening domains . using a version of the model without empty sites",
    ", we prepared the system in a state where half of the system is occupied by one alliance , the other alliance occupying the other half of the systems .",
    "this setup allowed us to compute the time and size dependence of the interface width .",
    "whereas the equilibrium fluctuations as well as the nonequilibrium fluctuations in the long time limit are described by the exponents of the edwards - wilkinson universality class , we found in addition a well defined transient regime where the growth exponent is 1/3 , i.e. the value one has for the kpz universality class .    the richness of the family of models studied in this paper is very remarkable and calls for a future in - depth study of the many intriguing features of spatial - temporal spirals as well as of coarsening processes with non - trivial internal dynamics within the domains . in this paper",
    "we have exclusively focused on numerical simulations .",
    "still , analytical approaches to investigate some of the intriguing features seem possible .",
    "we hope to address this and other issues in future studies .",
