    "the thompson group @xmath0 is a very fascinating mathematical object @xcite . despite the many various attempts , after many years the question whether it is amenable remains unsettled ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 admits some nice pictorial representation , as one may describe its elements by pairs of rooted planar binary trees with the same number of leaves . in a very recent paper ( @xcite ) , devoted to the search of connections between ( the planar algebra description of ) subfactors and the ( vertex algebra description of ) conformal field theory , v. jones gave some new insight on the mathematical structure of @xmath0 by considering it as a suitable replacement of the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle , and examining its role in the possible constructions of conformal models .",
    "proceeding along these lines , and analyzing carefully the mathematical setup , perhaps the most surprising conclusion in @xcite is that it is possible to take @xmath0 as a replacement of the familiar braid groups in a description of knots and links , thus opening a new line of research on the interplay between @xmath0 and low - dimensional topology .",
    "indeed , to each element of @xmath0 one can associate a suitable graph and a related link diagram in a way that we briefly recall below .",
    "especially , by exploiting this construction , it is provided evidence that certain well - known polynomial invariants , suitably normalized , define positive definite functions of @xmath0 and thus give rise to unitary representations .",
    "this is further illustrated with a concrete example by looking at the chromatic polynomial ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.2.1 ) . in the present paper",
    "we take up this point of view . among other examples ,",
    "we show that , up to a normalization , the evaluation of the kauffman bracket at some specific roots of unity provides again a positive definite function on @xmath0 .",
    "we also discuss similar statements for the tutte polynomial and the @xmath2-colouring of links .",
    "therefore , the specializations of these functions also yield unitary representations of the thompson group @xmath0 . in this short note",
    "we only consider the case of unoriented link diagrams .",

    "first of all we introduce the preliminary definitions .",
    "let @xmath89 be a positive odd integer .",
    "the definition @xmath297colouring is a generalization of tricoloring of link ( see @xcite , p. 162 , and @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath211 be a link and @xmath212 one of its diagrams .",
    "a link is said to be @xmath297colourable if every arc of the diagram is associated to an element of @xmath298 ( called colour ) , such that at each crossing the sum of the colours of the undercrossing is equal to the sum of the overcrossing .",
    "the number of @xmath297colourings is a link invariant and is denoted by @xmath299 .    in order to prove that @xmath297colourings defines a positive definite function on @xmath0 we introduce the following definition .",
    "let @xmath201 .",
    "the associated link may be decomposed in the two upper and lower halves , that is @xmath300 .",
    "we may call these halves as _ semi - links_.    we may represent these semi - links associated to @xmath21 by the following tangles @xmath45{5}\\ ] ] consider a pair of bifurcating trees @xmath21 with @xmath1leaves . the link @xmath38 may be seen as the _ n - sum of the semi - links _ which is defined by joining the corresponding strings in the rectangles .",
    "we denote the @xmath1sum of semi - links by the symbol @xmath301 .",
    "we want to introduce a partition function for the @xmath297colorings and we will recall some results of de la harpe and jones ( see @xcite , p. 219 ) .",
    "a link diagram is @xmath309regular graph , where the vertices are the crossings . for each vertex @xmath310",
    "we denote by @xmath311 the upper string and by @xmath312 the lower string .",
    "we set @xmath313 consider the partition function defined by @xmath314 where the sum over the functions @xmath315 .",
    "any such function is called _ state _ of the graph @xmath72 .",
    "we have that @xmath316 ( @xcite , _ example _ 4.1 , p. 22 ) .",
    "we can suppose that the @xmath164 with @xmath165 for @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to consider @xmath318 and prove that @xmath319 is positive semi - definite . our idea is to use the partition function in order to prove the claim .",
    "therefore @xmath320 for any @xmath321 , the expression @xmath322 defines the @xmath323th component of a vector in @xmath324 , i.e the component corresponding to @xmath325 .",
    "thus , we may define a vector @xmath240 and similarly a vector @xmath241 such that @xmath326 it follows by _ lemma _ [ inner - prod - matrix ] that the matrix @xmath319 is positive definite for any @xmath75 , i.e. the function @xmath317 is of positive type .",
    "it is well - known that a positive type function on a discrete group @xmath72 gives rise to a completely positive multiplier on the reduced @xmath327-algebra @xmath328 .",
    "one might investigate whether these or similar methods can be exploited to say anything of interest for other kind of multipliers on @xmath0 .",
