    "the question of how to stabilize the multitude of moduli fields that arise in any attempt at obtaining 4-d effective physics from string theory , is at present , still an open one .",
    "although there have been many notable attempts in the last few years ( see @xcite and references therein ) , many issues remain open .",
    "the majority of these attempts are crouched in the framework of low energy effective field theory , where either ad - hoc moduli potentials , potentials generated by higher order ( e.g. in @xmath0 ) effects , or potentials generated by fluxes are used to stabilize the various moduli fields . in spite of the various successes encountered by these attempts , they come up against some quite general problems , consistency with late time cosmology not least among them .",
    "a specific problem that accompanies moduli stabilization schemes that use potentials to fix the moduli fields , is the fact that any such potential will generate a cosmological constant at its minima , which introduces a host of other theoretical problems @xcite .",
    "string gas cosmology ( scg ) @xcite@xcite@xcite , on the other hand , has to date focused on a narrow subset of the moduli problem that of stabilizing extra dimensions . from its origins as a mechanism in which a 3 + 1 dimensional universe is generated by the dynamics of strings in the early universe @xcite@xcite , it has become clear that the effects of a string gas can stabilize any number of extra dimensions at the string scale in a way that yields a late time scenario that corresponds to our present day universe @xcite@xcite , provided that the dilaton has been fixed through some external mechanism .",
    "key to this stabilization mechanism , and to the consistency of the scg program in general , are the properties of a gas of massless string modes .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to report on even further - reaching consequences of massless string gas cosmology , which evidently contains a natural mechanism to stabilize all moduli fields for a particular toy model ( bosonic string theory compactified on a torus ) .",
    "we will shortly provide an a priori motivation for focusing specifically on massless string modes if sgc hopes to be theoretically and phenomenologically consistent , after which we will begin in earnest our attempt at moduli stabilization using these modes . before we do any of this however , we should offer a brief ( and neccesarily incomplete ) historical review of the scg program , in order to give us perspective on why we feel it is rather strategically placed to solve the moduli problem .",
    "the brandenberger - vafa ( bv ) mechanism ( proposed in @xcite ) , posits that the observed dimensionality of macroscopic spacetime arises from the dynamics of strings in the early universe .",
    "such a mechanism was put on firmer footing in @xcite , where it was reasoned that dilaton gravity ( i.e. a dynamical dilaton ) was neccesary for such a mechanism to work .",
    "such reasoning was based on the observation that any positive energy density and negative pressure ( which accompany winding string states ) in gereral cause the expansion of spacetime in general relativity , rather than its contraction or stabilization , whereas for dilaton gravity , negative pressures generically cause contraction . in the years that followed , much work has gone in to putting the ideas of @xcite on a firmer footing . among the more notable results",
    "has been the demonstration that the bv mechanism still holds once we include branes of various dimensions as well as strings as the fundamental degrees of freedom @xcite . since then , it has been shown that , in the context of dilaton gravity , string gases can effectively stabilize extra dimensions at the string scale @xcite , with a resulting isotropy of the non - compact dimensions @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that string gases can stabilize any number of extra dimensions even after the dilaton has stabilized @xcite@xcite , in a way that yields a resulting late time frw cosmology , and which has a consistent phenomenology ( which we will uncover for oursleves further on ) .",
    "there is beginning to emerge , a surprisingly complete cosmology that results from having string gases pervade the universe , which we hope will eventually provide us with testable predictions on the nature of dark matter and on effects on the microwave background @xcite , in addition to providing a framework in which one can potentially model non - singular bouncing cosmologies @xcite .",
    "even more recently , it has been shown @xcite that , in addition to stabilizing the moduli corresponding to the radii of the various cycles of a toroidal compactification , the shape moduli are also stabilized .",
    "emboldened by this , it might appear that if sgc can stabilize the dilaton itself , whilst preserving the stabilization of all of the moduli associated with the compactified dimensions , then it might serve as an example of how moduli stabilization in more complicated string theory settings might be effected .",
    "as mentioned previously , the workhorse for this paper is going to be a gas of massless string modes .",
    "exactly why this should be , will need no further justification if we can demonstrate moduli stabilization using these modes , but attempting an a priori answer to this question provides a useful check on the theoretical and phenomenological consistency of what we are doing , and answers some of the criticisms that have previously been raised against sgc .",
    "consider first the idea that a gas of strings can stablize the various moduli fields that might appear in our particular string compactification",
    ". an immediate objection one might have is that there is no way to do this without severely overclosing the universe .",
    "that is , since all string states have masses which go like the planck mass ( if we equate this to the scale of stringy physics ) :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a number of order unity for the lowest lying string states , and @xmath3 is the 4-d planck mass , one might expect a fluid of such strings to be phenomenologically ruled out .",
    "however , if we consider a gas of such strings which are massless , then one has a shot of evading phenomenological bounds . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was shown that a gas of massless string modes can effectively stabilize any number of extra dimensions at the string scale without overclosing the universe , whilst simultaneously providing a strong enough stablization mechanism that evades fifth - force constraints .",
    "given by the curvature of the potential for the radion .",
    "it turns out that this corresponding mass can be quite easily made large enough to avoid introducing any fifth - force interactions @xcite@xcite .",
    "] however , there is another important theoretical reason for us to focus exclusively on massless string modes",
    ". we will very shortly be considering dilaton gravity in the presence of string sources , and accordingly will be in the regime of a low energy effective theory described by the action :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the dilaton , @xmath6 is the @xmath7 dimensional metric tensor , @xmath8 the field strength of the two form field @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the dimensionful normalization of this action .",
    "this is specifically the ` massless background ' @xcite@xcite of the low energy effective fields , as it is only valid for curvature regimes such that :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the characteristic curvature of the background in question , and @xmath0 is related to the string tension as @xmath13 .",
    "as long as such a condition is satisfied , the curvature scale of the background is much bigger than the string scale , and massive string states will not be created .",
    "conversely , if we wanted to introduce massive string states , then we would have to include higher order corrections in @xmath0 .",
    "hence if we are to introduce a gas of strings as the matter content for the action above , then it should only consist of massless string states , as this action describes a consistent background for these states alone .",
    "a potential concern that one might have however is that , naively , one might violate ( [ cr ] ) if we are considering compactifications of the extra dimensions that are at the string scale .",
    "however , it turns out that when we consider the spacetime dynamics of such a gas on a toroidally compactified background , which eventually results in the stabilization of the extra dimensions and the dilaton , and compute the components of the ricci scalar throughout the evolution of the system , we will find that the condition ( [ cr ] ) is satisfied to an excellent degree .",
    "hence our framework is consistent throughout , and we will be justified in using the low energy effective action ( i.e. dilaton gravity ) as the framework for our physics .",
    "further issues concerning aspects of the string spectrum which we will be using are considered in the appendix , where we derive the energy momentum tensor for a gas of strings the backgrounds of interest for this report .",
    "there , we find that a string gas contributes an energy momentum tensor that can be derived from the following action :    @xmath14,}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the internal energy of our string gas , which depends on the spatial part of the metric and the dilaton field . from this",
    ", we immediately infer that sgc has several compelling advantages over the effective field theory approach to moduli stabililzation .",
    "we see from the form of the above action , that one does not have the usual fine tuning problems associated with introducing potentials for the moduli fields .",
    "such a potential would contribute to the energy momentum tensor from the action :    @xmath16    where one would have to fine tune the minimum of the potential to vanish at the stabilization point to avoid an unacceptably large de - sitter phase of evolution after stabilization .",
    "we see from ( [ mod ] ) that the coupling of the string gas to gravity is rather more complicated than just the usual @xmath17 dependence , and the potentials one derives from the moduli fields from ( [ mod ] ) do not require their minima to be fine tuned at all , and in fact , quite generically result in freidman - roberston - walker ( frw ) expansion of the non - compact dimensions@xcite . in this way",
    ", we evade the negative results of giddings @xcite concerning radial moduli stabilization .",
    "however from a purely phenomenological point of view , sgc has yet another advantage over the field theoretical approach to moduli stabilization : consider the fact that any potential one introduces to stabilize the moduli will , from the prespective of the 4-d effective theory , cause the modulus in question to have a mass given by :    @xmath18    whereas the contribution to the energy density of the universe of such a stablization potential will go like :    @xmath19    which , if we are close to the minimum of the potential , is also proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "when we try to make contact with present day observations , the simultaneous requirement that the mass of the moduli field be large enough so that we evade fifth - force constraints , whilst small enough so as not to overclose the universe becomes very difficult to satisfy , and introduces its own host of fine - tuning problems . the case for string gases is markedly different .",
    "we will see further on that the 4-d masses of the moduli fields generated by the string gas go like :    @xmath21    where @xmath15 is the energy of a constituent massless string , @xmath22 is a number density and @xmath23 is the scale factor of the non - compact dimensions .",
    "this is to be compared with the contribution of the string gas to the energy density of the universe , which goes like :    @xmath24    we notice that the two have an inverse dependence on the energy ( i.e. center of mass momentum ) of the massless strings in question .",
    "this is a situation which would be impossible to obtain from a field theoretical framework , and as we will see later , quite easily allows us to evade fifth - force constraints whilst avoiding overclosing the universe without any fine tuning .",
    "hence , we feel that sgc is a framework that is a priori , very well qualified to solve the moduli problem , the resolution of which we will turn to shortly .",
    "since we do not wish to prejudice the applicability of this work to a particular string theory ( i.e. a particular corner of moduli space ) , we leave the dimensionality of spacetime , and the number of compact dimensions general , we only assume that some dimensions are toroidally compactified and that f - strings ( and later , d - strings ) are admitted as stable degrees of freedom .",
    "we will , of course , pick specific cases when the need arises .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : borrowing from results in the appendix , where we derive the energy momentum tensor of a gas of strings in our background ( following @xcite ) , we then set up the model in section 2 .",
    "after carefully considering the question of frame switching , we study the dynamics of the coupled string gas / dilaton gravity system , and review the result @xcite that , given a stable dilaton , the extra dimensions are stabilized at the string scale . we then show that we obtain dilaton stabilization given a background with stabilized extra dimensions .",
    "next , we demonstrate that the coupled radion - dilaton system also stabilizes , but in a somewhat unsatisfactory manner , in that one of the modes of the coupled system becomes becomes massless from the perspective of the 4-d effective theory ( and hence phenomenologically unacceptable ) .",
    "we then generalize our framework to include d - string degrees of freedom , and find that in certain cases , possibly involving the breaking of supersymmetry , we can simultaneously stabilize the dilaton and the moduli describing the extra dimensions .",
    "our conventions are as follows : we work in @xmath7 spacetime dimensions , with the @xmath25 spatial dimensions partitioned into @xmath26 non - compact dimensions and @xmath27 compact dimensions .",
    "we use the ` mostly plus ' metric with signature @xmath28 , and work in natural units ( @xmath29 ) with all dimensions expressed in terms of electron volts ( ev ) .",
    "spacetime indices will be denoted by greek indices \\{@xmath30 } , with the non - compact spatial indices denoted by lower case latin indices from the middle of the alphabet \\{@xmath31 } , and compact spatial indices , with lower case latin indices from the beginning of the alphabet \\{@xmath32}.",
    "consider the dilaton gravity action in the string frame ( where we set the form fields to be vanishing ) :    @xmath33    by performing the conformal transformation :    @xmath34    and using the relation ( where tilded quantities refer to the fact that they involve @xmath35 ) :    @xmath36    we can re - express the above action ( after integrating the term involving @xmath37 by parts ) as :    @xmath38    now , were we to set :    @xmath39    we could re - express the above action as :    @xmath40    which is the action for einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field .",
    "we henceforth refer to the metric @xmath41 as the einstein frame metric .",
    "we observe that the @xmath42 dimensional newton s constant is given by :    @xmath43    we now introduce a gas of strings as the sources for the dilaton gravity action , which in its present form sees the dilaton as a scalar field minimally coupled to einstein gravity .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for a gas of strings in one extra dimension was derived in @xcite , and generalized to any number of extra dimensions in @xcite .",
    "it was found there that proceeding from the nambu - goto action for a single string , and then hydrodynamically averaging , one would obtain the same energy momentum tensor for a string gas in the string frame if one were to derive this from the interaction term given by :    @xmath44.}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is the energy of a single string ( on which we will elaborate further on ) in the given background , and @xmath22 is the number density of the string gas ( in the string frame ) with the metric dependence factored out :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the spatial part of the metric .",
    "recall that once the dilaton has stabilized , the string frame and the einstein frames are equivalent .",
    "having taken dilaton stabilization for granted , it was shown in @xcite and @xcite that a phenomenologically consistent stabilization of the extra dimensions at the self dual radius follows , with a resulting frw late - time cosmology .",
    "since it is the goal of this paper to show that , in addition to this , string gas cosmology is also capable of stabilizing the dilaton , we should consider the question of frame switching seriously .",
    "for this reason , and for completeness in general , we derive the energy momentum tensor of a gas of strings in the einstein frame in the appendix .",
    "it turns out that after doing the analysis , one can obtain the energy momentum tensor of a string gas in the einstein frame by transforming the above interaction lagrangian using ( [ ct ] ) :    @xmath48,}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is given by ( [ fix ] ) . defining the metric of the compact directions in the string frame as @xmath50",
    ", we see that :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the metric for the compact directions in the einstein frame .",
    "we use the result @xcite that the energy of a closed string in the string frame , in the given background is given by :    @xmath53},}\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is the center of mass momentum along the @xmath26 non - compact directions and @xmath55 is a p - dimensional scalar product where @xmath27 is the number of compact directions . @xmath56 and @xmath57 are p - dimensional vectors respectively describing the momentum and winding quantum numbers along the @xmath58 compact direction , and @xmath2 is the string oscillator level .",
    "note that in the above , we have eliminated the left moving oscillators @xmath59 , using the level matching constraint @xcite@xcite :    @xmath60    from this we find that ( [ inte ] ) then becomes :    @xmath61},}\\ ] ]    from which we define :    @xmath62}.}\\ ] ]    deriving the energy momentum tensor as @xmath63 , we find that :    @xmath64.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from now on , for simplicity we will drop the tildes on the metric quantites in the einstein frame , in which we remain from now on .",
    "the metric tensor in the einstein frame is taken to be @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath26 being the number of non - compact directions , and @xmath66 given by :    @xmath67    that is , the only effect of switching from the string frame as far as the energy momentum tensor of a string gas is concerned is this field dependent redefinition of @xmath0 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . notice that in the above , we have only derived the energy momentum tensor for a gas of strings with a fixed set of quantum numbers , indexed by \\{@xmath68 } , with a number density that will depend on these quantum numbers : @xmath69 . in general our string gas",
    "will contain a whole host of different quantum numbers , and these will all have to be summed over to arrive at the correct energy momentum tensor .",
    "however it was shown in @xcite that if at some initial time we were in a situation of thermal equilibrium ( defined through ( [ nd ] ) ) , then all the number densities , instead of being arbitrary are given by :    @xmath70    where the subscript ` ref ' refers to some reference state , which we take to have zero energy , and @xmath45 is given by ( [ tenergy]) recalling that we have now dropped the tildes to indicate einstein frame quantities .",
    "after careful consideration of what constitutes the thermal bath that couples these modes to each other , it was then shown in @xcite that by defining the following quantity ( where we now generalize the result to include the contribution of the dilaton ) :    @xmath71    one could derive the components of the energy momentum tensor as follows :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 ( and in a similar way , @xmath15 ) is defined through the equation :    @xmath74    with @xmath75 being the pressure along the @xmath76 direction . notice that in this setup , our interaction lagrangian ( [ int ] ) is given by :    @xmath77,}\\ ] ]    which corresponds to the framework of @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "it was argued that since the energy of a closed string in a given background is given by :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is a term of order unity for the lowest lying string states , and that since for all string theories , the hagedorn temperature @xcite is of order @xmath80 @xcite , that the summation in ( [ z ] ) projects out all but the massless string states if we are even an order of magnitude below the hagedorn temperature @xcite .",
    "since our focus is on late times , we now have an operational meaning of such a time when the temperature of the universe has cooled to below an order of magnitude below the hagedorn temperature .",
    "this is still considerably higher than the gut scale , and so late times in our framework refers only to the string scale .",
    "however this is only of passing interest to us , as we have argued that we shall only be interested in massless string modes from the outset .",
    "what this does indicate is that one can obtain these modes , demanded by phenomenological and theoretical consistency in a rather natural manner .",
    "turning now to the dilaton , one finds that the associated energy momentum tensor of the dilaton field is given by :    @xmath81    where the pressure is the same for all directions ( be they compact or not ) .",
    "consider now the einstein equation for the @xmath76 diagonal element of the metric tensor @xcite :    @xmath82,}\\ ] ]    where these equations are to be supplemented by the @xmath83 einstein equation :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the hubble factor associated with the @xmath76 scale factor : @xmath86 .",
    "notice that this equation is the only place where the dilaton field factors , as its contribution to the energy momentum tensor drops out of ( [ ee ] ) , as @xmath87 . inserting ( [ rho])-([pa ] ) into ( [ ee ] )",

    "now we choose to begin at or around the self dual radius ( @xmath91 ) , with @xmath5 beginning at or around @xmath92 ( i.e. @xmath93 as in ( [ fix ] ) ) .",

    "now we expand the above around :    @xmath96    the equations of motion which result are :    @xmath97\\bigr ] = 0,}\\ ] ]    @xmath98 = 0.}\\ ] ]    we now consider three separate cases of interest to us , namely when we take the dilaton to be fixed and the radii dynamical , when the radii are fixed , and the dilaton is dynamical , and when the radii and the dilaton are both taken to be dynamical .",
    "we will motivate the fact that we investiagate these cases seperately in what follows .",
    "this case was already investigated in @xcite , and so our treatment here will be brief .",
    "one might imagine that the dilaton is stabilized by some mechanism external to string gas cosmology , either through potentials generated by higher order corrections , or some other mechanism such as supersymmetry breaking .",
    "furthermore , one assumes this mechanism renders the dilaton massive , with a mass that is far greater than the mass of the radion ( given by the coefficient of @xmath99 in ( [ gam ] ) ) .",
    "this allows us to ignore the fluctuations of the dilaton in ( [ gam ] ) , which results in the following equation of motion :    @xmath100\\bigr ] = 0.}\\ ] ]    clearly , if we study the fluctuation of a single mode ( by setting @xmath101 for all indices @xmath102 not equal to the mode we re interested in , then the above equation describes damped oscillations about the self dual radius ( @xmath103 ) , with a mass squared given by the ` spring constant ' :    @xmath104    however to undertake a full stability analysis , one needs to compute the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix corresponding to this coupled radion system , and show that they are all positive .",
    "indeed , one can write the above driving term as @xmath105 , where upon defining @xmath106 , we find that ( up to an overall positive factor ) :    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is given by :    @xmath109    now @xmath110 is a @xmath27 by @xmath27 dimensional matrix , which has as its eigenvalues ( in units of @xmath108 ) :    @xmath111    that is , @xmath112 appears with a degeneracy of @xmath113 , and @xmath114 appears once .",
    "clearly , these are all positive and hence describe a stable equilibrium . if we consider the driving term of ( [ dc1 ] ) in its own right , that is by not restricting to small perturbations around the self dual radius , one finds that for the volume modulus , the driving term correpsponds to the potential indicated in fig 1 .    as found in @xcite ,",
    "the non - compact dimensions undergo a period of frw expansion after radion stabilization , with a radion mass given by the spring constant in ( [ gamo ] ) , which upon using the relation :    @xmath115    and setting the scale of stringy physics to be at the planck scale ( @xmath116 ) , yields a radion mass :    @xmath117    and a 4-d energy density :    @xmath118    we remind the reader that @xmath119 is the center of mass momentum ( energy ) of these massless strings .",
    "we have neglected factors of order unity in deriving the above .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that for all @xmath120 in the present epoch , one can evade fifth - force constraints whilst simultaneously ensuring that the energy density of this string gas ( which looks like hot dark matter ) remains below several orders of magnitude of the critical density .",
    "we now consider that somehow , the moduli corresponding to the extra dimensions has stabilized at the self - dual radius through some mechanism that does nt couple to the dilaton ( or at least contributes feebly to its dynamics ) , such as from the effects of some scalar field , or some other as yet unknown mechanism .",
    "the most obvious candidate mechanism , the effects higher dimensional branes in the presence of fluxes , turns out to couple to the dilaton , though it may be possible to arrange this coupling to not significantly affect the driving term ( [ eld2 ] ) .",
    "the relevant point being that it is no less arbitrary to assume the stabilization of extra dimensions , than it is to assume the stabilization of the dilaton . doing so , we find that the equation of motion for the dilation fluctuation becomes :    @xmath121,}\\ ] ]    which corresponds to motion in the potential ( illustrated in fig 2 . ) :    @xmath122.}\\ ] ]    the mass generated for the dilaton by the string gas is given by the curvature of this potential at its minimum , which can be read off ( [ om ] ) :    @xmath123    again , using ( [ newtred ] ) and setting the scale for stringy physics to be of the planck scale ( @xmath124 ) , we find that :    @xmath125    whereas the 4-d energy density of the string gas that generates this potential is given ( as before ) by ( [ raded ] ) .",
    "note that all the features advertised in the introduction have made their appearance here .",
    "there was no need to worry about exactly where the miniumum of the potentials for the various moduli occur , as there is no need to fine tune when the form of the action for a string gas takes the form ( [ mint ] ) .",
    "we also see that the mass of the various moduli can be made large enough ( to avoid fifth force type interactions ) without overclosing the universe ( see @xcite for a more detailed treatment ) . in taking stock of what we have accomplished",
    ", we see that we have stabilized the dilaton around its expectation value ( @xmath126 ) , but we have no way of predicting precisely what this value is . recall that the action ( [ da ] ) undergoes an overall rescaling under an additive redefinition of the dilaton , where the observed newtons constant is then given by :    @xmath127    we find that whatever this @xmath92 is , the dynamics of a gas of massless strings will stabilize the dilaton around this value , and hence render it constant .",
    "it does not have the ability to predict what the expectation value of the dilaton will be ( a situation that as we will see , will change when we consider the full dynamics of the system ) .",
    "certainly this seems to indicate something peculiar about the dynamics of our moduli stabilization framework , and as we will see shortly , is a first indication of the presence of a flat direction in moduli space .",
    "however at present , we can view this result as something of a boone , in that such a mechanism is capable of stabililzing the dilaton no - matter which particular corner of moduli space one finds themselves in .",
    "of course one would like to be able to predict what the constants of nature are from a given moduli stabilization mechanism , and as such this is somewhat of an unsatisfactory situation .",
    "it is only of passing interest to us however , as the main focus of this report will be the case of when we consider the coupled dynamics of the radion - dilaton system , to which we turn our attention to now .",
    "recall the equations of motion for the fluctuations of the radion and the dilaton fields ( [ gam])([om ] ) :    @xmath128\\bigr ] = 0,}\\ ] ]    @xmath129 = 0.}\\ ] ]    we have already see how the radion fields and the dilaton are separately stable .",
    "it is a straightforward generalization to study the case of when both sets of moduli are dynamical . to find out if the coupled system is stable , we have to find out if we are at a point in moduli space which corresponds to a global minimum .",
    "it seems straight forward to generalize the treatment above , where it seems that all we have to do is to compute the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix .",
    "however there is a subtle issue here the driving term for the dilaton is given by :    @xmath130    whereas the driving term for the radii is given by ( c.f .",
    "( [ z])-([mint ] ) ) :    @xmath131z.\\ ] ]    if one were to write the driving term for the radii as @xmath132 for some @xmath133 , then in general this will not be the same @xmath133 that one derives the driving term for @xmath49 because of their different origins ( wheras one comes from linear combinations of the einstein equations , the other comes from the euler lagrange equations ) .",
    "however , were one to make the trivial rescaling :    @xmath134    where @xmath26 is the number of spatial dimensions , one can write the above driving terms as the partial derivative of a master potential. the neccesity in doing this comes from the fact that were we to naively take the second derivatives of the driving term above , one finds that @xmath135 .",
    "this rescaling allows us to write the above driving terms as the derivative of the appropriate potential . from this , we find that , up to an overall positive factor :    @xmath136    which corresponds to the @xmath137 by @xmath137 dimensional hessian matrix ( again up to the positive factor ( [ opp ] ) ) :    @xmath138    this matrix has eigenvalues @xmath139 , which appears with degeneracy of @xmath27 , and 0 , which appears once ( in fact the corresponding eigenvalue for such a p+1-dimensional matrix is @xmath140 ) .",
    "the appearance of a zero mode to this system implies that one degree of freedom in this coupled system is not stabilized ( albeit marginally ) .",
    "in fact , one can directly obtain the normal modes of the system from ( [ gam00])([om00 ] ) :    @xmath141    @xmath142    from which we conclude that the individual radial moduli ( @xmath99 ) tend towards the dilaton ( i.e. @xmath143 ) quite robustly , which , from the definition of @xmath144 , results in @xmath144 tending towards @xmath145 , which now no longer has a mass .",
    "this is not to say that this modulus is free to run away , as according to ( [ normk ] ) , one can solve for @xmath144 to find that :    @xmath146    which implies that in a universe with expanding non - compact dimensions ( which is easily obtained in our framework @xcite@xcite ) , this modulus terminally approaches some finite value .",
    "however , this is far from satisfying to say the least , as this modulus is no longer robustly held at any particular value and fluctuations and interactions are likely to shift the value of this modulus significantly through time .",
    "one can quite easily understand the physical origins of this zero mode .",
    "recalling the energy of a closed string ( [ tenergy ] ) in the given background :    @xmath147,}\\ ] ]    we see that if instead of stablizing at @xmath148 , were @xmath49 to stabilize at some other value , say @xmath149 , then modes which were massless for @xmath150 at the self dual radius are now massless at @xmath151 at the radius defined by @xmath152 .",
    "hence were we to begin at this point in moduli space , and compute the sum over massless modes in our equations of motion ( as in how we arrived at ( [ gam00])([om00 ] ) ) , one would end up formally identical equations for the fluctations about this point in moduli space , and obtain the same results for our stabilizty analysis .",
    "this would certainly indicate that we have a flat direction in the dynamics of our coupled system .",
    "before we attempt to resolve this unsatisfactory state of affairs , we wish to point out that were the dilaton to receive a potential due to effects external to sgc ( i.e. through higher order corrections ) , then one retrieves a stable equilibrium for our system _ for any value of the stabilized dilaton @xmath151 _ , where the extra dimensions stabilize at @xmath152 .",
    "that is , were some external potential to stabilize the dilaton , the hessian matrix at the stabilized point in moduli space would then read :    @xmath153    where the only difference is in the last diagonal entry . in the above",
    ", @xmath154 is some positive factor ( the overall factor for the string gas contributions to the hessian will not be the same as that for the dilaton stabilization mechanism ( [ opp ] ) ) .",
    "this matrix generically has all of its eigenvalues as positive for any positive @xmath155 .",
    "for instance , for 6 extra dimensions in @xmath156 , one finds that the hessian matrix has the eigenvalues ( in units of @xmath108 ) :    @xmath157    which are all positive .",
    "hence we conclude that one can consistently stabilize extra dimensions in string gas cosmology independent of any particular ( external ) dilaton stabilization mechanism .",
    "this ameliorates the difficulties encountered in @xcite , which studied precisely this aspect of the problem , but neglected the effects of massless string states .",
    "returning however to the issue at hand , which is to explore ways in which some mechanism within sgc might lift the zero mode of the coupled dilaton - radion system , we offer a quick recap of the possibilities raised previously .",
    "firstly , one could introduce higher dimensional branes and turn on fluxes , in the hope that this can somehow enhance the stabilization of the extra dimensional moduli but not the dilaton ( or vice versa ) , in which case we would end up with the two separate situations considered in the previous section .",
    "alternatively , one could introduce branes and fluxes and not aim for preferential enhancement of the stabilization mechanisms of one of the two sets of moduli , but instead see if doing so can somehow otherwise lift the zero mode ( as we have seen , obtaining even a small additional positive component to the last diagonal entry in ( [ hess2 ] ) suffices ) .",
    "however there are compelling reasons for us to focus solely on one particular possibility namely the introduction of a gas of d - strings .",
    "in the introduction , we made a rather detailed case as to why massless string modes should be the only concern of string gas cosmology if it aspires to be relevant to the present epoch .",
    "consider then what it would mean to introduce branes of various dimensions into our framework .",
    "since we do not yet know how to quantize any extended object other than strings , we will have to content ourselves with a purely classical treatment of such objects , for which the lowest energy configurations have energies :      where @xmath159 is the worldvolume of such an object , and @xmath160 is the tension of such a p - dimensional object ( typically the pth power of the string tension ) .",
    "we see that introducing a gas of such objects would run counter to the spirit of what we have done so far , in that we would then be introducing objects which have a significant energy density , calling into question any applicability to late time cosmology , and possibly taking us away from the regime of the low energy effective theory ( [ se ] ) in which we are working in .",
    "hence if we are to be consistent with our own demands , we should ignore these objects altogether .",
    "however , we find that there is one class of d - branes which evades the objections just made , namely d - strings .",
    "not only are d - strings quantizable ( in certain backgrounds , with caveats ) , they also have the same massless excitations as the f - string @xcite , and offer a window of opportunity to lift the zero mode uncovered in the previous section as they couple to the dilaton in a different manner than f - strings .",
    "this follows from the action for d - string in the absence of fluxes ( in the string frame ) :          we will elaborate on the tension of the d - string further on . in",
    "what follows , we will be using the fact that as mentioned , one can indeed quantize the d - string in certain backgrounds . as a solitonic object in string theory , whether one can do this or not is a highly non - trivial question",
    ". however it should be clear that for a constant dilatonic background , ( [ dstra ] ) describes the same action as that for the f - string , with a corresponding redefinition of @xmath0 .",
    "one should certainly be able to quantize this action and recover the spectrum of states ( which follows from the constraint algebra alone ) , if one can do this for the f - string .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that one can indeed covariantly quantize the superstring , provided the form fields satisfied certain conditions . in @xcite the canonical equivalence of the constraint algebra of the d - string and the type iib string is established , which implies that these two objects have the same spectrum .",
    "since we have endeavoured to keep the background theory in which our framework is established arbitrary , we do not consider this issue further , taking as an assumption that one can indeed quantize d - strings in the corner of moduli space we are considering .",
    "we argue in the appendix that for situations in which the dilaton field changes much , much slower than the string scale ( defined by @xmath165 which we show later holds to an excellent approximation in our model ) , the only change in the d - string gas energy momentum tensor after switching to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) , compared to that for the f - string gas ( [ rho])-([redef ] ) , is the replacement @xmath166 :                    where the numerologically peculiar factor @xmath172 will turn out to have little consequence .",
    "a gas of d - strings ( with a fixed set of quantum numbers ) will yield an energy momentum tensor ( in the einstein frame ) that can be derived from the action :      where the subscript @xmath42 on @xmath174 indicates that this number density is specific to the d - string gas , which for massless states we take as equal to the number density for the f - string gas . just as before",
    ", if we realise that one has contributions from each massless state , then one has to perform a sum over massless modes to arrive at the correct energy momentum tensor ( see discussion immediately following ( [ dist ] ) ) .",
    "the equations of motion that result are as follows :        we now make the observation that at a generic point in moduli space , quantum numbers which render the f - string massless are not the same as those which render the d - string massless ( a detailed treatment of what follows is given in appendix b ) . for instance",
    ", at the self - dual radius ( @xmath177 ) , with the dilaton stabilized around @xmath92 ( i.e. @xmath150 ) , the mass of the f - string is given by ( c.f .",
    "( [ tenergy ] ) ) :           we note that whether or not the particular modes indicated above are realised or not depends on the number of extra dimensions .",
    "for instance for one or two extra dimensions , it will not be possible to satisfy @xmath180 etc .",
    "we shall be most interested in the first four possibilities , classed separately above .",
    "this is because these states are not only massless at the self dual radius , with @xmath150 , they are also massless to first order away from this point in moduli space . the first possibility ( @xmath181 ) corresponds to unwound gravitons . as mentioned before , these states do not directly contribute to the dynamics of the moduli fields , as can be seen from ( [ dc ] ) and ( [ eld ] ) .",
    "the second possibility , in light of the level matching constraint can be seen to imply states of the form @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , corresponding to singly wound strings .",
    "these strings have an equal and opposite quantum of momentum along the same dimension , at oscillator level 1 . the third possibility ( again re - applying the level matching constraint ) yields @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath184 as massless quantum numbers corresponds to a singly wound state at oscillator level zero , with one quantum of momentum of the same sign along the same dimension . the fourth possibillity ( @xmath185 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 )",
    "will also prove to be relevant .",
    "the second class of states are all at oscillator level zero , and correspond to various multiply wound / unwound strings with / without motion along various cycles of our torus .",
    "we now examine the behaviour of states with the quantum numbers tabulated above , as we move away from the rather special point in moduli space that we began in .",
    "to do this , we perturb our moduli as follows :          from which we see that only the first class outlined above remain massless to first order . for the first three states in the above table , the contribution from the metric fluctuations vanishes because @xmath192 and @xmath193 are equal to each other up to a sign . for the states with quantum numbers given by @xmath185 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , only those states that have entries in the same rows have vanishing fluctautions .",
    "that is , the condition @xmath194 implies that these states either have no entries in common , or two entries in common .",
    "the contribution from the metric fluctations would be non - vanishing in the former case , but for the latter , states of the form below remain massless to first order :      where we only indicate the entries which the two vectors have in common .",
    "our problem is now reduced to the following : having determined which states enter the summations in ( [ dc ] ) and ( [ eld ] ) , we have to compute their contribution to the driving term taking care to account for all of them .",
    "we shall only compute the driving term for the radial moduli , as the case for the dilaton proceeds identically . recalling that the unwound graviton states ( @xmath182,@xmath196 ) do not contribute to the driving term ,",
    "we compute the contribution of the states with quantum numbers @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 to the driving term of ( [ dc ] ) as :      the factor of @xmath198 comes from the overall degeneracy of the states which can appear either as , for example @xmath199 , @xmath200 or with the opposite signs , with the factor @xmath119 coming from the factor of the energy in the denominator in the summand in ( [ dc ] ) . the states with quantum numbers @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath184 sum to yield an identical contribution to the driving term .",
    "it is non - trivial , but straightforward to compute the contribution of the states corresponding to @xmath185 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , where we find that we end up with the identical contribution as above , except now with the prefactor of @xmath201 , where @xmath113 has the combinatorial origin as being the number of ways one can pick two entries to be identical out of @xmath27 choices , and @xmath202 corresponds to the overall degeneracy of these states ( as indicated above ) .",
