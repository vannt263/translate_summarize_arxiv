    "the @xmath0 s observation of the vela pulsar @xcite shows that , in its light curve , as the energy increases , a third peak appears at the trailing part of the first peak and shifts towards the second peak , which makes this known @xmath1-ray pulsar before @xmath0 s era more special .",
    "we want to use our two - layer outer gap model @xcite to explain the strange third peak and its movements .",
    "our two - dimensional two - layer model has explained the phase averaged spectra of the mature pulsars , including the vela pulsar , in the first catalogue of @xmath1-ray pulsars of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , to study the pulse profile , a three - dimensional model is needed .",
    "therefore , we extend the two - layer model to a three - dimensional magnetic field . here",
    "we present our simulations of the energy dependent light curves and the explanation of the moving third peak of vela pulsar , by three - dimensional two - layer outer gap model .",
    "in this study , the three - dimensional rotating vacuum dipole field is adopted .",
    "the @xmath1-ray emissions come from the region with strong accelerating electric field , which extends above the last - open filed lines and between the null charge surface of the goldreich - julian charge density @xcite and the light cylinder .",
    "this region has a two - layer structure .",
    "as shown in figure  [ struct ] , in the trans - field direction of the magnetic field , the outer gap can be divided into two parts :    * the main acceleration region at the lower part of the outer gap , where the charge density is assumed to be @xmath2 10  % of the goldreich - julian value and a strong electric field is accelerating the particles to emit gev photons via the curvature process , * the screening region around the upper boundary , where the growth of the main acceleration region in the trans - field direction is stopped by the pair - creation processes .",
    "and we use a simple step function to approximate the distribution of the charge density in the trans - field direction in the poloidal plane ( the plane where the field lines have same polar angle @xmath3)as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 represent coordinates along the magnetic field line , the height measured from the last - open field line , and the azimuthal direction .",
    "in addition , @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the thickness of the main accretion region and the total gap thickness , respectively .    instead of solving the real three - dimensional poisson equation , we divide the gap into many equal divisions in the azimuthal direction and regard each slice of the gap as a two - dimensional two - layer gap . for each division ,",
    "the solution of the potential in our two - dimensional study is applied .",
    "the shape of the @xmath1-ray spectrum of the division is determined by three parameters : @xmath9 , fractional gap thickness , @xmath10 , ratio of the thicknesses of the primary and whole region , and @xmath11 , the number density in the main acceleration region .",
    "we define the gap fraction @xmath9 measured on the stellar surface as @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the stellar radius , and @xmath14 is the polar cap radius .",
    "the accelerating electric field @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "the accelerating electric is caused by the deviation of the charge density from the goldreich - julian charge density , so we introduce a parameter @xmath17 to represent this deviation , the @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfy the relation , @xmath19 . for each slice of the gap ,",
    "the deviations of the charge density in the two region , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath10 satisfy @xmath22",
    "the first step is to determine the viewing angle and the inclination angle by making the ` geometry determined ' light curve , whose peaks are due to the caustic effect and almost do not dependent on the energy .",
    "our two - dimensional study shows that the fractional size of the gap is small ( around 0.16 ) , therefore , in this study , we trace the magnetic field lines of @xmath23 .",
    "the factor @xmath24 is used to represent the magnetic field lines at a given layer , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the last - open field lines and magnetic axis , respectively .",
    "the emission direction is calculated in observer s frame @xcite .",
    "the curvature photon is assumed to be emitted in the direction of the particle motion , which can be described as an combination of the motion along the magnetic field line and the drift motion , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is calculated from the condition that @xmath29 .",
    "the polar angle to the rotation axis @xmath30 of the emission direction and the pulse phase @xmath31 are calculated from @xcite @xmath32 if a point in a field line satisfies @xmath33 , the radiation of that point can be seen by the observer , where @xmath34 is the viewing angle and @xmath35 is the solid angle of the radiation .    .",
    "the @xmath5-axis is the pulse phase and the @xmath36-axis is the direction of the radiation .",
    "the dashed line is the viewing angle , which is chosen as @xmath37.,width=245 ]    we find that the set of ( @xmath38 ) reproduces right peak separation of the two peaks .",
    "figure  [ skymap ] shows the skymap of the emitted photons from the magnetic surface of @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath37",
    ".    then we calculate the @xmath1-ray spectrum to find proper values of the three parameters , @xmath41 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "we find that the values of these three parameters used in the two - dimensional study can provide a good spectrum . here",
    "we assume the distance to the pulsar is 325  pc .    at last",
    ", we calculate the phase resolved spectra under the parameters found above , and integrate the phase resolved spectra to obtain the energy dependent light curves .",
    "the number of the photons measured at pulse phases between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is calculated from @xmath44 where the @xmath45 is the phase resolved spectrum .",
    "the calculated pulse profile under constant values of the three parameters in azimuthal direction can not explain the existence of the observed third peak .",
    "the fact that the simple caustic model can not explain the phase shift of the observed third peak , forces us to consider more complex structure of the emission region .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ 3dis ]    by the definition of @xmath9 in equation  ( [ def_fm ] ) , we may choose the form of the azimuthal distribution of @xmath9 as , @xmath46 where the @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the maximum value of the polar cap radius , and the factor 0.18 is chosen by fitting the phase averaged - spectrum .    it is expected that as the null charge surface is closer to the stellar surface , the number density of the x - ray photons increases in the gap and the screening region becomes thinner due to higher pair creation rate .",
    "therefore , we assume the formula of the ratio as @xmath49 by fitting the spectral shape , we obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    with the two - dimensional two - layer model , we found that the phase - averaged spectra for most of the @xmath1-ray pulsars can be reproduced by the averaged charge density of @xmath52/h_2\\sim 0.5 $ ] . in three - dimensional magnetosphere",
    ", the actual @xmath53 can make the particles in different @xmath3-cell to drift into other @xmath3-cell via the effect of @xmath54 . as a result ,",
    "the actual average density is @xmath55 where the @xmath56 is used and @xmath57 is the averaged charge density without drift motion . using the relationship between @xmath58 , @xmath21 and @xmath10 given by equation  ( [ eqn9 ] ) , the distribution of @xmath41 can be obtained .",
    "we expected that the particles displacement due to the drift motion becomes more important on the magnetic field line that has a smaller radial distance to the null charge surface , because the particles run longer distance in the outer gap . to take into this effect",
    ", we assume the formula of displacement as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a fitting parameter , which is chosen as -28@xmath61 .    table  [ 3dis ] summaries the effects of the distributions of the parameters on the energy dependent light curves .",
    "figure  [ edlc_3dis ] shows the pulse profiles calculated by taking into account the azimuthal distributions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding phase averaged spectrum is shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "figure  [ colmap ] is the intensity map in the pulse phase and the energy plane .",
    "the color represents the scaled number of the photons at the certain interval of the pulse phase .",
    "we find a moving third peak from the results .",
    "we also fit the calculated phase resolved spectra with power law plus exponential cut - off form .",
    "figure  [ ecutgamma ] shows the cut - off energy and the photon index , as functions of the pulse phase .",
    ", @xmath10 and @xmath9 , provided by the three - dimensional outer gap .",
    "the solid lines are the observed light curves from fermi - lat @xcite.,width=325 ]    , @xmath10 and @xmath9 , comparing with the observed data ( circle ) from fermi - lat @xcite , width=245 ]",
    "the reason for the third peak and its shift is as follows . in the light curves , when energy lower than 1  gev , the distributions of the thickness ratio @xmath10 makes a third - peak structure at @xmath62 pulse phase , because @xmath10 affects the emissivity in the screening region , which mainly produces the curvature photons of the energy less than 1  gev . in the energy bands",
    "higher than 1  gev , on the other hand , the azimuthal distributions of the fractional thickness , @xmath9 , and the number density , @xmath41 , are more important , and they produce the third peak at @xmath63 pulse phase by providing higher electric field and more particles , respectively . consequently , the differences in the standing phases of the third peak due to the distributions of @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11(or@xmath41 ) produce the shift of the third peak with the photon energy .",
    "why is the vela pulsar so special ?",
    "this is because : 1 ) it has a thin gap to make sure that its observable radiation contains both the contributions of the two layers .",
    "2 ) its @xmath1-ray radiation is dominated by curvature photons that keep the effects of azimuthal structure of the gap visible .",
    "3 ) two - dimensional study shows that the shape of the spectrum is very sensitive to @xmath64 and @xmath65 , when @xmath11 and @xmath10 get close to 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "this makes the effects of azimuthal structure of the gap obvious .",
    "4 ) the inclination angle also determines the azimuthal structure of the gap .",
    "the third peak of vela pulsar can not be explained by the caustic effect determined by the magnetic field structure .",
    "this peak is due to the azimuthal distributions of the fractional gap thickness ( @xmath9 ) , the ratio of the thicknesses of the primary and whole region ( @xmath10 ) , and the number density in the main acceleration region ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath9 make third - peak - like structure in the bridge region of light curve above 1 gev , while the distribution of @xmath10 makes a bump in the bridge region of the light curves below 1 gev .",
    "the phases of the third peaks caused by the azimuthal distributions of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath9 are different from each other .",
    "consequently , the differences in the phases produce the shift of the combined third peak with the photon energy .",
