    "the general belief that qcd undergoes a phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma phase at high temperature has triggered a lot of activity both on the theoretical as well as on the experimental side . the original argument put forward by casher  @xcite suggesting that confinement implies dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and hence that the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions take place simultaneously at least at zero chemical potential , has been pursued and so far confirmed in theoretical studies on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "this also agrees with the phenomenological determinations of the vacuum energy density in the bag model , with an energy density difference between the wigner and goldstone realizations of chiral symmetry .",
    "it has also been shown that in the large @xmath0 limit with the temperature @xmath1 kept fixed , if a chiral phase transition takes place it should be first order  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of qcd distinctive order parameters at finite temperature to hadronic properties has been the subject of much attention over the recent past @xcite mainly in connection with theoretical expectations on the formation of quark - gluon plasma and the onset of deconfinement . indeed , even if such a state of matter is produced in existing ( rhic , sps @xcite ) and future ( lhc ) facilities , the states which are detected are hadrons created in a hot environment .",
    "thus , it makes sense to study the properties of hadrons in a medium which can undergo a confinement - deconfinement phase transition . for heavy masses ,",
    "quarks become static sources and there is a general consensus that the order parameter can be taken to be the polyakov loop or thermal wilson line @xcite where the breaking of the center symmetry signals the onset of deconfinement .",
    "dynamical light quarks , however , break explicitly the center symmetry and no criterion for deconfinement has been established yet @xcite . in qcd , there has been an increasing interest in developing effective actions for the polyakov loop as a confinement - deconfinement order parameter because of their relevance in describing the phase transition from above the critical temperature  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in a hot medium , one also expects that the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is restored at some critical temperature . for this chiral phase transition the quark condensate",
    "is commonly adopted as the relevant order parameter .",
    "the melting of the chiral quark condensate has been observed on the lattice  @xcite , is suggested by chiral perturbation theory extrapolations  @xcite and is numerically reproduced in chiral quark models before  @xcite and after inclusion of pion corrections  @xcite ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    where theory has most problems is precisely in the interesting intermediate temperature regime around the phase transition , because both the lightest goldstone particles and the polyakov loop degrees of freedom should play a role , if they coexist .",
    "up to now it is uncertain how the corresponding states couple to each other from a fundamental qcd viewpoint , hence some modeling is required . based on previous works  @xcite and to comply with chiral symmetry it seems natural to couple chiral quark models and the polyakov loop in a minimal way as an effective space dependent color chemical potential . the work in ref .",
    "@xcite accounts for a crossover between the restoration of chiral symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry , reproducing qualitatively the features observed on the lattice simulations @xcite and which find a natural explanation in terms of dimension two condensates  @xcite . in this",
    "regard we want to argue below that the special role played by the gauge symmetry at finite temperature actually requires this coupling , and elaborate on the consequences of it when the quantum gluon effects are considered .",

    "we review some facts on large gauge symmetry at finite temperature in sect .",
    "[ sec : lgt ] which are put into the context of chiral quark models .",
    "next , we address the problem suffered by chiral quark models at finite temperature in section  [ sec : problem ] where we argue that the origin of the difficulty is related to a defective treatment of the large gauge symmetry at finite temperature .",
    "thus , to comply with gauge invariance at finite temperature one should at least couple the quarks to the @xmath2 gluon field .",
    "we do this in section [ sec : polyakovcoupling ] .",
    "this is equivalent to make the replacement @xmath3 which corresponds to an @xmath4-dependent chemical potential coupling in the color fundamental representation .",
    "obviously , this coupling introduces a color source into the problem for a fixed @xmath5 field .",
    "in order to project onto the color neutral states we integrate over the @xmath5 field , in a gauge invariant manner . in section",
    "[ sec : oneloop ] we describe the consequences of such a coupling and projection in chiral quark models for a variety of observables at the one quark loop approximation .",
    "actually , as we will show , there is an accidental @xmath6 symmetry in the model which generates a triality ( super)selection rule at this level of approximation , from which a strong thermal suppression , @xmath7 follows in the quenched approximation .",
    "this puts some doubts on whether chiral quark models do predict a chiral phase transition at realistic temperatures as we advanced in previous communications  @xcite .",
    "corrections beyond one quark loop are discussed in section  [ sec : corrections ] where we see that the suppression at low temperatures actually becomes @xmath8 , very much along the expectations of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite .",

    "the failure of perturbation theory at finite temperature in a gauge theory has generated lot of discussion in the past mainly in connection with topological aspects , chern - simons terms , anomalies , etc . in the case of the topological chern - simons term",
    "radiatively induced by fermions in @xmath27 dimensions @xcite it was puzzling to find , in the perturbative treatment , that the chern - simons quantization condition @xcite was violated at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently shown that , within a non perturbative treatment , no contradiction arises @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a derivative expansion approach , suitably defined at finite temperature , was appropriate to deal with this problem .",
    "we will use this approach in the present work .      in pure gluodynamics at finite temperature one can use the center of the gauge group to extend the periodic transformations to aperiodic ones @xcite , @xmath28 so that @xmath29 is an element of @xmath6 .",

    "nevertheless such selection rule becomes relevant to chiral quark models in the large @xmath0 limit and departures from it are found to be suppressed within chiral quark models in the large @xmath0 limit at low temperatures , due to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry which generates heavier constituent quarks from light current quarks .",
    "this issue will be analyzed along this paper .",
    "chiral quark models have been used in the past to provide some semiquantitative understanding of hadronic features in the low energy domain . at zero temperature chiral quark models",

    "these gluon effects are treated within perturbation theory at @xmath45 .",
    "this approximation induces some sub - leading corrections in the calculation of color singlet states where the effects of confinement can be almost completely ignored for the low lying states @xcite .",
    "this perturbative gluon dressing also complies with the interpretation that the whole quark model is defined at a low renormalization scale , from which qcd perturbative evolution to high energies processes can be successfully applied  @xcite . when going to finite temperature , chiral quark models predict already at the one loop level a chiral phase transition  @xcite at realistic temperatures . however , even at low temperatures single quark states are excited what is obviously not very realistic for it means that the hot environment is in fact a hot plasma of quarks . on the other hand",

    "this is confirmed below .",
    "these boltzmann factors control the whole physics and temperature effects are sizeable for @xmath134 .",
    "our observation on the boltzmann factor is rather puzzling because it seems hard to understand how is it possible to generate non singlet states by just increasing the temperature .",
    "the reason has to do with the fact that the condensate itself is not invariant under @xmath6 transformations at finite temperature .",
    "for the example of the condensate we trivially obtain @xmath135 i.e. , the condensate at finite temperature can be written as a coherent sum of nonlocal quark condensates at zero temperature .",
    "if we make a gauge transformation of the central type , we get @xmath136 i.e. , the condensate can be decomposed as a sum of irreducible representations of a given triality @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the state with boltzmann factor @xmath137 is indeed a multiquark state .",
    "this avoids the paradox , and suggests that in order to make a ( centrally extended ) gauge invariant definition of the condensate we could simply discard from the sum those terms which do not have zero triality , i.e. we would get @xmath138 this would generate as a first thermal correction a term with a boltzmann factor corresponding to mass @xmath139 ( a baryon ) which is obviously very much suppressed . since a quark loop generates a dependence proportional to @xmath0 we would obtain a @xmath140 dependence .",
    "another problem now comes from comparison with the expectations of chiral perturbation theory at finite temperature  @xcite . in the chiral limit , i.e. , for @xmath141 the leading thermal corrections to the quark condensate for @xmath142 , for instance ,",
    "are given by @xmath143 \\label{eq:2.16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the finite temperature correction is @xmath0-suppressed as compared to the zero temperature value , since @xmath144 scales as @xmath0 .",
    "this feature remains for finite pion mass , and is generic to any thermal correction in chpt ; the dominant contribution comes from quantum pionic fluctuations and not from quark thermal excitations .",
    "although the previous formula predicts a lowering of the quark condensate , it can not describe the chiral phase transition since chpt assumes from the start a non vanishing chiral condensate . in this sense ,",
    "the scaling behavior of the critical temperature with @xmath145 and therefore with @xmath0 suggested from direct extrapolation of the formula can only be regarded as an assumption .    at this point",
    "we should remind that the mechanism by which the chiral symmetry is restored at finite temperature in standard chiral quark models in the one quark loop approximation is quite different from the trend deduced from chpt based mainly on pion loops . while in the first case it is due to populating states of the dirac levels with the fermi - dirac thermal factor and a sudden decrease of the constituent quark mass gap @xmath146 , in chpt the `` phase transition '' is merely due to large quark - antiquark excitations with the lightest pion quantum numbers with a fixed gap ( otherwise chpt method can not be applied ) .",
    "these two pictures of the chiral symmetry restoration are not dual to each other ; the @xmath0 behavior of the critical temperature is different since in chiral quark models one has @xmath147 while in chpt the extrapolated value of the `` critical temperature '' is @xmath148 .",
    "quantum fluctuations have been included in chiral quark models at finite temperature  @xcite ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and they are known to be @xmath149 suppressed . actually , the sub - leading @xmath150 contribution reproduces the first term of chpt , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.16 ] ) , thus largely dominating at low temperatures . taking into account that chpt by itself and more refined approaches incorporating meson resonance effects  @xcite provide a similar values of the `` critical temperature '' quite close to the lattice predictions  @xcite for dynamical fermions and extrapolated to the chiral limit , one may wonder what is the meaning of the mean field quark chiral phase transition predicted in the past  @xcite and which has become a justification for chiral quark models at finite temperatures .",
    "these problems are also common to models where quarks and mesons are regarded as independent degrees of freedom .",
    "we will see in the rest of the paper how a convenient @xmath0 suppression of quark thermal corrections arises naturally when a color source , the polyakov loop , is coupled to the chiral quark model and subsequent projection onto color neutral states is carried out . in this scenario",
    "one would have a large transition temperature @xmath151 due to quarks , i.e. no symmetry restoration due to filling in the states above the dirac levels in the absence of dynamical gluons and in the quenched approximation ( polyakov cooling ) .",
    "non perturbative gluonic corrections modify this picture ; they do predict instead a critical temperature roughly equal the deconfinement phase transition , @xmath152 .",
    "finally , pion loops are protected from additional suppressions , so that the final result will be fully compatible with the chpt behavior at low temperature .",
    "as we have said , one can formally maintain gauge invariance at zero temperature by coupling gluons to the model . in the spirit of the model these degrees of freedom should be treated within perturbation theory , since the constituent quarks carry some information on non - perturbative gluon effects ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for explicit calculations in the low energy limit ) . at finite temperature",

    "nevertheless , it is tempting to see how these results may be modified not only at low temperatures but also in the region around the phase transition when the proper quantum and local nature of the polyakov loop is considered .",

    "unfortunately , such a distribution is poorly known and lattice simulations are not designed to extract it , since a subtle renormalization issue is involved @xcite . as a first step to investigate the phase transition in the polyakov chiral quark model beyond the mean field approximation we just take the strong coupling model for the gluonic action of ( [ eq:3.8 ] ) . due to the rather large exponential suppression , this ansatz has the virtue of reducing to the haar measure in the low temperature regime , and as a consequence the vanishing of the adjoint polyakov loop expectation value observed in lattice calculations @xcite follows . in our view",
    "this is a compelling reason to go beyond mean field by integrating over polyakov loops .",
    "however , such a distribution preserves center symmetry and would not generate a phase transition per se in gluodynamics .",
    "this is unlike the mean field approximation where the action is minimized by center symmetry breaking configurations . as discussed before a side product of this approximation is to miss the fluctuations and also to introduce an explicit coordinate dependence in the gauge group . in our model",

    "@xcite . at present , and taking into account the many possible sources of corrections to our calculations we do not see how more accurate predictions could reliably be made in the context of polyakov - chiral quark models .",
    "nevertheless the semiquantitative success indicates that essential features for the center symmetry breaking phase transition are encapsulated by these models , and further attempts along these lines should be striven .",
    "nevertheless , it should be reminded that although the breaking of the center symmetry in this model is only attributed to the presence of quarks , one also has a contribution from gluons . in this regard",
    "let us mention that ignoring the exponentially suppressed gluon action ( [ eq:3.8 ] ) in the averaging has almost no effect below the phase transition and shifts up the transition temperature by about @xmath355 , a value within our error estimate .",
    "given the importance of quarks in the phase transition one may wonder if the temperature dependent volume enhances the breaking of the center symmetry .",
    "in fact , the volume at the transition temperature is roughly equal to gluon volume @xmath356 in ( [ eq : g_potential_sce ] ) . at low temperatures the exponential suppression dominates in the polyakov loop expectation value where the volume appears as a harmless prefactor ,",
    "see e.g. ( [ eq : l_njl_lowt ] ) .",
    "the effect of replacing the temperature dependent volume by a constant one can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : volume ] .",

    "as we have argued the expectation value of the polyakov loop is rather small at temperatures well below the phase transition .",
    "the difference between the mean field and the direct integration can be best quantified at the level of the fluctuations .",
    "while at the mean field level the probability of finding a given polyakov loop would be a delta function , one expects a spreading of such probability due to quantum effects .",
    "for @xmath38 the polyakov loop contains two independent variables , which correspond to gluon fields in temperature units .",

    "note that @xmath360 is not normalized to unity , instead its integral gives the full partition function ( see appendix [ sec : njl_app ] ) . as noted in sect .",
    "[ sec : dyn - pol ] by gauge invariance the distribution is invariant under permutation of the three angles @xmath361 , @xmath362 and @xmath363 .",

    "( [ eq : one - body ] ) .",
    "thus one obtains an equivalent one - body distribution as @xmath365 it is interesting to compare how this distribution evolves across the phase transition , and to look for the effects generated explicitly by the fermion determinant . in fig .",
    "[ fig : polyakov_prob ] we present such a comparison . below the phase transition , and as already advanced in sect .",
    "[ sec : dyn - pol ] , the weighting function presents three maxima at equidistant values , as required by the center symmetry . in this case",
    "the quark determinant plays a negligible role , although a tiny , indeed exponentially small , center symmetry breaking can be observed .",
    "as we see there appears an interesting concentration of angles in the region around the origin as the phase transition takes place .",
    "the quarks are very effective suppressing contributions not near @xmath93 . as a consequence the lack of the spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry in ( [ eq:3.8 ] ) becomes not very relevant for temperatures above the transition .",
    "a further trace of fluctuations can be seen by considering higher group representations of the polyakov loop . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctuation ] we also show the expectation value of the polyakov loop in the adjoint representation , @xmath366 . according to the lattice results of the matrix model in ref .",

    "[ fig : fluctuation ] .",
    "@xmath369 goes to zero in the large  @xmath1 regime , and this is compatible with the fact that the one - body distribution  @xmath187 tends to concentrate near @xmath371 as the temperature increases . in the second equality of eq",

    "this introduces , however , a color source which generates any possible color non - singlet states , calling for a projection onto the physical color singlet states , or equivalently evaluating the path integral over the @xmath5 field in a gauge invariant fashion . as such",
    ", the average includes both the gluon action and the quark determinant .",
    "models for the gluonic part have been discussed on the light of pure gluodynamics results on the lattice .",
    "the net result is that , contrary to standard chiral quark model calculations at finite temperature , no single quark excitations are allowed in physical observables .",
    "more generally , the leading thermal corrections at the one quark loop level start only at temperatures near the deconfinement transition .",
    "given the fact that this strong suppression effect is triggered by a group averaging of polyakov loops we have named this effect polyakov cooling of the quark excitations .",
    "thus , and to a very good approximation , we do not expect any important finite temperature effect on quark observables below the deconfinement transition .",
    "in particular the chiral symmetry breaking transition can not occur before the deconfinement transition .",
    "in such a situation the biggest change of observables such as the quark condensate should come from pseudoscalar loops at low temperatures and perhaps other higher meson resonances at intermediate temperatures .",
    "this is precisely what one expects from chpt or unitarized approaches thereof which effectively include these loops on resonances .",
    "it is rewarding to see how in practice the apparent contradiction between chiral quark models and chpt in the intermediate temperature region may be resolved by a judicious implementation of the polyakov loop .    the extrapolation of these ideas to the phase transition is straightforward but more ingredients are needed . as an illustration we have investigated in a model the kind of effects one might expect from such a schematic polyakov - chiral quark model when",
    "both the quantum and local nature of the polyakov loop are taken into account .",
    "several interesting features arise out of such an investigation . at low temperatures",
    "the polyakov loop is suppressed exponentially in the constituent quark mass suggesting that eventually more accurate lattice measurements might provide a method to extract the constituent quark mass in a gauge invariant fashion . according to our analysis corrections to this leading behavior",
    "are provided by pion loops .",
    "it would be extremely helpful to find a general theoretical setup where these chiral corrections might be reliably computed .",
    "moreover , we find that the explicit breaking of the center symmetry due to dynamical quarks at low temperature is @xmath149 suppressed .",
    "this is a direct consequence of averaging over gauge field configurations and confirms the current usage of the polyakov loop as an order parameter in the unquenched case . on the light of the present findings one might conjecture that in the large @xmath0 limit the polyakov loop becomes a true order parameter of full qcd .",
    "another feature we find is that the contribution of the gluon dynamics below the phase transition does not seem to be crucial .",
    "this is welcome since this is precisely the region where least information can be deduced from lattice simulations besides the known preservation of the center symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , it would rather interesting for our understanding of the low temperature gluon dynamics to compute directly from the lattice the polyakov loop probability distribution . from our results we deduce that although the qualitative features observed in more simplified treatments are confirmed by calculations , one might expect large uncertainties in the determination of critical parameters , such as the critical temperature .",
    "our estimate is @xmath372 for @xmath142 .",
    "even given these large uncertainties , the very fact that a crossover between chiral symmetry restoration and center symmetry breaking takes place in the bulk part of the expected lattice qcd simulations with a minimal number of parameters is very encouraging and motivates that further studies along these lines should be pursued .",
    "finally , a more intriguing aspect regards what kind of model independent information could be inferred out of these models , where quarks and polyakov loops are coupled , in the regime around the phase transition .",
    "for instance , the low temperature behavior of the chiral condensate can be described using chiral perturbation theory in terms of the zero temperature chiral condensate with no explicit reference to the underlying quark and gluonic degrees of freedom due to the dominance of pionic fluctuations .",
    "given the fact that the polyakov loop is a gauge invariant object which vanishes at zero temperature , it would be extremely helpful to isolate what physical states could equivalently describe such an observable and what specific zero temperature qcd operators drive its low temperature behavior .",

    "<S> we describe how the inclusion of the gluonic polyakov loop incorporates large gauge invariance and drastically modifies finite temperature calculations in chiral quark models after color neutral states are singled out . </S>",
    "<S> this generates an effective theory of quarks and polyakov loops as basic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong suppression of finite temperature effects in hadronic observables triggered by approximate triality conservation ( polyakov cooling ) , so that while the center symmetry breaking is exponentially small with the constituent quark mass , chiral symmetry restoration is exponentially small with the pion mass . to illustrate the point we compute some low energy observables at finite temperature and show that the finite temperature corrections to the low energy coefficients are @xmath0 suppressed due to color average of the polyakov loop . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also shows how the phenomenology of chiral quark models at finite temperature can be made compatible with the expectations of chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the implications for the simultaneous center symmetry breaking - chiral symmetry restoration phase transition are also discussed . </S>"
