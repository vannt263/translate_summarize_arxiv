    "the infinite - range of the coulomb potential has always been a source of numerous problems in both theoretical and numerical studies of the quantum mechanics of charged particles .    from a theoretical point of view , the @xmath2 coulomb asymptotics implies the presence of an essential singularity of the coulomb green s function at @xmath3 in the complex plane , contrary to that of potentials quickly vanishing at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this has prevented for a long time the use of the simple and elegant demonstration of the completeness of bound and scattering states solutions of the one - body schrdinger equation of r.  newton @xcite , as the latter explicitly demands @xmath5 to be integrable on @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the basis - generating potential . until recently , no simple proof existed for the coulomb case , as the only available methods requested abstract lebesgue measure theory @xcite , thus hindering any physical understanding of this fundamental property .",
    "hence , new methodologies had to be devised in order to have both simple and rigorous demonstrations , based on a generalization of the method of r.  newton @xcite or on closeness arguments with standard complete sets of states @xcite , which rely heavily on the analytical properties of coulomb wave functions .    at the numerical level ,",
    "the computational effort necessary to evaluate coulomb wave functions is tremendous compared to that of its uncharged counterpart , the analytical ricatti - bessel function . indeed , even though analytically expressible in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions @xcite , coulomb wave functions are very difficult to calculate , especially in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "they can vary by many orders of magnitude over a relatively small region and thus demand the use of many different numerical techniques @xcite . added to that , they exhibit a cut in the complex plane on @xmath8-\\infty:0]$ ] , which creates a supplementary difficulty as the functions issued from continued fractions , for example , are analytical therein @xcite .",
    "when one considers a fourier - bessel transform of potentials bearing a coulomb tail , no problem appears at the theoretical level .",
    "this comes from the fact that the latter can always be decomposed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a quickly vanishing potential and @xmath11 is a constant . indeed , on the one hand , the fourier - bessel transform of @xmath10 is well - behaved , and on the other hand , the term proportional to @xmath2 has a fourier - bessel transform analytical for all orbital momentum @xmath12 , equal to @xmath13/\\pi$ ] , where @xmath14 is the legendre function of the second kind @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath14 diverges like @xmath15 when @xmath16 @xcite , so that the momentum space representation of @xmath7 has a logarithmic singularity on its diagonal at @xmath17 , and consequently can not be discretized readily , as the diagonal of the discretized matrix is infinite .",
    "nevertheless , the fourier - bessel transform of @xmath2 is integrable , so that it is possible to solve this problem with subtraction frameworks , where singularities are integrated analytically , leaving a regular rest integral to be handled numerically @xcite .",
    "this has been successfully applied for the diagonalization of the coulomb potential in momentum space in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , no attempt has been made using berggren bases @xcite .",
    "the latter are sets of wave functions generated by finite - range potentials and comprise bound , resonant , and scattering states of complex - energy , which are solutions of the one - body schrdinger equation .",
    "berggren sets of eigenstates are widely used in nuclear physics to solve the many - body problem , as they allow complex nuclear wave functions to be expanded in a basis of slater determinants built from berggren one - body states , in the so - called gamow shell model framework ( see ref.@xcite for a recent review on that subject ) . due to the presence of scattering states in berggren bases , the asymptotic behavior of complex many - body wave functions can be precisely reconstructed , which is impossible to attain in practice with bases of well - bound states , such as sets of harmonic oscillator states .",
    "they are then very well suited to expand halo and unbound many - body nuclear states @xcite , whose properties can not be understood without a precise reproduction of their asymptotic properties .",
    "generating potentials are usually of woods - saxon type , which mimic the effect of the inert core on valence nucleons @xcite .",
    "hartree - fock potentials are also utilized , as their variational character allows configuration mixing to be minimized @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "wave functions can not be conveyed in an analytical form and have to be computed numerically .",
    "completeness properties of berggren sets of states have been established firstly by t.  berggren for uncharged particles @xcite , while the charged case could be handled only recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "completeness relations have been tested by numerically diagonalizing hamiltonians sustaining spherical and axially - deformed nuclear potentials for both charged and uncharged particles @xcite , but where the coulomb potential is absent from the diagonalized kernel . if one considers nuclear wave functions of a fixed nucleus , this problem is just anecdotic , as , due to its one - body character , the infinite - range part of the coulomb potential , which is spherical , can always be included in the basis - generating potential , leaving a finite - range residual interaction to diagonalize @xcite . however , this is no longer possible if one wants to calculate observables connecting nuclei bearing different numbers of protons , as the same berggren basis has to be used to expand the many - body wave functions of both father and daughter nuclei .",
    "problems also occur to calculate isospin operators expectation values with berggren bases ( see for example ref.@xcite for a study of isospin mixture of isobaric analog states of @xmath18 nuclei ) .",
    "indeed , it is needed therein to evaluate one - body matrix elements @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be scattering wave functions .",
    "if proton and neutron wave functions of a given partial wave are generated by the same potential , @xmath19 matrix elements are proportional to a dirac delta distribution . in the opposite situation , however",
    ", dirac delta distributions can not arise as proton and neutron radial wave functions of same quantum numbers @xmath22 are not orthogonal , so that matrix elements are undefined .",
    "consequently , both proton and neutron berggren set of states have to be generated by the same one - body hamiltonian , for example with the basis - generating potential of neutron states , so that the infinite - range coulomb hamiltonian has to be diagonalized along with the residual nuclear interaction .",
    "thus , in this paper , a one - body hamiltonian possessing an infinite - range proton potential , thus presenting a coulomb point potential asymptotic , will be diagonalized with berggren bases employing three different discretization schemes .",
    "the first scheme is simply to cut the coulomb potential at a finite distance @xmath23 , determined so as to provide optimal results .",
    "the second scheme is a subtraction technique , akin to that expressed in ref.@xcite , and the third scheme consists of replacing the diverging diagonal elements by off - diagonal terms , which become diagonal at the continuum limit .",
    "these methods will be described in detail in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , where they will be respectively labeled by `` the cut method , '' the `` subtraction method , '' and the `` off - diagonal method . '' numerical applications will be presented in sec .",
    "[ examples ] for three different partial waves , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where both narrow and broad resonant states will be considered .",
    "the considered expanded one - body wave functions , namely the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 proton states , arise typically for nuclei for which @xmath1 , so that their study is important for future calculations of many - body states of light nuclei with the gamow shell model . numerical methods proper to the use of proton berggren bases states , generated by a potential with a coulomb asymptotic , will also be discussed .",

    "one can see that the cut method produces very poor results , as it does not even reach the precision acquired with the off - diagonal method when the smallest value of the number of gauss - legendre scattering states @xmath107 ( see sec .",
    "[ berggren_basis_discretization ] ) is employed .",
    "moreover , for the @xmath28 proton state , although a rather good description of energy and width occurs , the reproduction of the wave function is mediocre",

    "the best reproduction of the considered proton states clearly arises with the off - diagonal method , for energies , widths and wave functions .",

    "gauss - legendre quadrature then yields fast convergence to the numerical value of the integral defined by the off - diagonal method , which happens to be almost equal to the exact singular kernel ( see sec .",
    "[ off_diagonal_method ] ) .",
    "bases carrying a continuous part , such as berggren bases , are very interesting as they allow the expansion of complex many - body wave functions of loosely bound and unbound states , as both proper asymptotic properties and particle intercorrelations via configuration mixing are present therein . however , the use of berggren bases is accompanied by mathematical difficulties generated by the unbound character of the considered one - body states . indeed , their completeness properties request many more efforts to be proved than for discrete sets of states , to which the whole apparatus of the theory of compact operators can be applied .",
    "furthermore , the very question of their numerical implementation is challenging in the context of charged particles , as coulomb wave functions have to be calculated for this type of problem .",
    "discretization of berggren bases is also central in numerical applications , which is conveniently effected with gauss quadrature but demands discretization error to be assessed .",
    "handling of infinite - range interactions is therefore problematic with unbound bases , because the representation of the former give rise to operators bearing singularities , which introduce infinities when berggren bases are discretized .    in the case of coulomb potential , kernels are singular but integrable , so that frameworks built from subtraction techniques , based on analytical integration of singularities , have been devised in the context of fourier - bessel transform .",
    "however , they could not be directly applied to berggren bases , because they rely on the analytical character of the fourier - bessel transform of coulomb point potential .",
    "hence , in this paper , three different discretization schemes have been studied when the coulomb potential is included in the hamiltonian to diagonalize , namely the cut method , where the coulomb potential is suppressed after a finite radius @xmath23 , the subtraction method , similar to those utilized with fourier - bessel transform , and a new framework , the off - diagonal method , which amounts to substituting diagonal infinite matrix elements by close but finite off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "numerical applications have been considered for three different partial waves , with the examples of @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 resonant proton states , arising typically from studies of nuclei having @xmath1 nucleons .",
    "woods - saxon potentials carrying different charges have been employed for basis - generating and diagonalized hamiltonians .",
    "while the cut method could be expected to convey poor precision , the off - diagonal method has been demonstrated to outperform the standard subtraction method .",
    "this has been explained by the fact that gauss - legendre quadrature is applied within the subtraction method to integrate finite but nonanalytic functions , whereas only smooth integrands are treated with gauss - legendre quadrature within the off - diagonal method .",
    "according to the present study , the latter technique should be taken into account seriously when diagonalizing hamiltonians possessing an infinite - range coulomb part .",
