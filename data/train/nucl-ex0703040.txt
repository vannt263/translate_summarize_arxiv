    "experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite at brookhaven national laboratory have shown that hadron production at high transverse momentum @xmath0 ( @xmath0  @xmath6 6 gev/@xmath5 ) is suppressed for central au+au collisions relative to nucleon - nucleon collisions or peripheral au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "this suppression is thought to be related to jet quenching in dense partonic matter  @xcite . at intermediate @xmath0 ( 2  @xmath4  @xmath0  @xmath4  6  gev/@xmath5 ) , in central collisions ,",
    "the baryon to meson ratio is higher than in peripheral collisions  @xcite .",
    "this feature may be due to hadronization through the recombination of quarks  @xcite .",
    "the energy loss by energetic partons traversing the dense medium formed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is predicted to be proportional to both the initial gluon density  @xcite and the lifetime of the dense matter  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the nuclear modification factor ( nmf , defined later ) significantly constrains parameters in theoretical model calculations . the quantitatively large suppression pattern observed at high @xmath0 , for both light hadrons and those involving heavy quarks  @xcite , has renewed interest in the mechanism of energy loss , namely , the relative contribution of radiative and collisional forms .",
    "the dominance of one over the other depends upon @xmath0 and energy  @xcite .",
    "recently , for a given beam energy a universal dependence of high @xmath0 nmf on the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath10 ) was proposed as a signature of radiative mechanisms being the dominant energy loss processes  @xcite . on the other hand , it was suggested that radiative energy loss will break @xmath11 (=  2  @xmath0/@xmath1 ) scaling  @xcite .",
    "thus , a detailed study of the energy , @xmath0 , and @xmath10 dependence of identified hadron production and hadron scaling properties is needed to continue the investigation of energy loss mechanisms .    in this letter",
    "we report the results of such a study performed using identified charged pions , protons , and anti - protons for rapidities @xmath2@xmath3@xmath2  @xmath4  0.5 and @xmath0  @xmath4  12  gev/@xmath5 for au+au at @xmath1  =  62.4 and 200 gev . the data were taken by the star experiment at rhic  @xcite .",
    "identified particle @xmath0 spectra at different beam energies will also enable the study of the effects of the energy dependence of parton energy loss and initial jet production on the produced hadron @xmath0 spectra . at high @xmath12 ( @xmath12  @xmath13   6 gev/@xmath5 ) , pions are expected to originate dominantly from quark jets at @xmath1  =  62.4 gev , while both gluon and quark jets contribute substantially to pion production in the same @xmath0 region at @xmath1  =  200  gev  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a factor of @xmath14 3 difference in @xmath11 ( for a given @xmath0 ) at the two beam energies may allow the study of the difference in energy loss mechanisms for quarks and gluons .",
    "this difference in energy loss is due to the non - abelian feature of color charge dependence of parton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , as @xmath15 production is dominantly from gluon jets , the @xmath16/@xmath17 ratios are sensitive to quark and gluon jet production in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",

    "baryon and meson production at high @xmath12 and the relative contributions from quark and gluon jets have been discussed in refs .",
    "the new observations presented in this paper necessitate further understanding of the role of gluons , quarks and their energy loss mechanisms .",
    "gluon jets tend to produce more baryons than quark jets , whereas quark jets contributes substantially to pion production .",
    "this feature is supported by a much lower @xmath8 ratio at high @xmath0 compared to the @xmath7 ratio for low - energy @xmath22+@xmath22 and @xmath22+a collisions  @xcite .",
    "the double ratios in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are consistent with this picture as the @xmath8 ratio is lower at 62 gev than at 200 gev . due to their larger coupling gluons should lose more energy in the dense medium formed in heavy - ion collisions than quarks  @xcite .",
    "this would lead to a lower @xmath8 ratio for central au+au relative to peripheral au+au at both beam energies .",
    "this is not observed for the data reported here",
    ". a larger value of the @xmath7 ratio at 62 gev than at 200 gev is observed .",
    "this may be due to greater valence quark contribution at the lower beam energy .",
    "however , the @xmath7 double ratio shows no centrality dependence .",
    "this is not expected if valence quarks contribute significantly more at lower energy and lose energy in the dense medium formed for central au+au .    at intermediate @xmath0 ,",
    "the features of the double ratios are not expected from the coalescence model ; as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the quark coalescence models will lead to more prominent baryon enhancement at 62 gev than at 200 gev .",
    "it is , however , surprising that the scaling is independent of centrality and extends to high @xmath0 when baryons are more enhanced at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "we have presented a study of the energy dependence of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath15 production for au+au at @xmath1 = 62.4 and 200 gev .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra are measured around midrapidity ( @xmath2@xmath3@xmath2  @xmath4  0.5 ) over the range 0.2  @xmath4  @xmath0  @xmath4  12 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "these measurements provide new experimental data for investigating the production of quarks , gluons and their interactions with the medium formed in heavy - ion collisions and the interplay between coalescence of thermal partons and jet fragmentation .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath80 for charged pions and for protons and anti - protons is different at both energies .",
    "however , at higher @xmath0 the values of @xmath52 for baryons and mesons at both energies are similar .",
    "the comparison of @xmath73 versus @xmath0 to model predictions provides important information on quantities like initial gluon density and lifetime of dense matter .",
    "the @xmath22/@xmath69 ratios for au+au at @xmath58 = 62.4 gev are higher than the corresponding values at @xmath1 = 200 gev in the intermediate @xmath85 range , but the @xmath15/@xmath70 ratios are smaller .",
    "there is serious quantitative disagreement between data and the available theoretical models .",
    "we observe a scaling of the @xmath15/@xmath70 ratios between corresponding centralities for the two beam energies at @xmath86 gev / c despite the strong centrality and @xmath12 dependence of these ratios .",
