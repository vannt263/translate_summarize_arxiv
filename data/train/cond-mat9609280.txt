    "in a recent paper @xcite , srensen and macdonald studied the integer quantum hall effect in a double  layer system with uncorrelated disorder .",
    "they investigated numerically the localization properties of single ",
    "electron states for two limiting cases : of a short  range and of a smooth disorder . for a short  range disorder ,",
    "the relevant parameter is @xmath1 , which is the ratio of the tunnel integral and the disorder  induced width of the landau level .",
    "if this ratio is large , the situation is transparent since localization of states , belonging to symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the size ",
    "quantization wave functions , occurs independently .",
    "thus , one has two delocalized levels , located at the two well  separated maxima of the density of states , and spaced in energy by @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath3 , the density of states has only one maximum ; the usage of the basis of symmetric and antisymmetric combinations is inadequate .",
    "however , it was demonstrated in the simulation of ref .",
    "( see also ref . )",
    "that the separation of delocalized states is close to @xmath2 even for @xmath4 as small as @xmath5 . in other words ,",
    "the positions of delocalized states with uncorrelated disorder appear to be the same as in the case of correlated disorder .    to study the case of a smooth disorder , the authors @xcite employed the network model proposed by chalker and coddington @xcite , which was generalized to describe a double  layer system in a way similar to that in refs .",
    ". in the chalker ",
    "coddington model , the delocalization results from the tunneling of an electron , moving along equipotential lines , through the saddle points of the random potential .",
    "the randomness of the potential is included by assuming the phase acquired by an electron traversing a link ( equipotential line ) to be random .",
    "for a double  layer system each link of a network carries two channels .",
    "the authors tried several variants of incorporating the inter ",
    "layer tunneling through the coupling between the channels .",
    "the results obtained were essentially the same .",
    "in contrast to the case of two spin  split levels with random mixing @xcite , the authors observed the doubling of the correlation length exponent .",
    "one of the main conclusions made in ref . on the basis of the simulation performed ,",
    "is that there is no observable splitting in the positions of the delocalized states within the range of @xmath1 studied , which makes doubtful the applicability of the network model to the double  layer systems . motivated by this observation , in the present paper we take a microscopic approach to the problem .",
    "in a strong magnetic field the structure of electronic states in the presence of a smooth potential is determined by its topography .",
    "the crucial difference between the cases of correlated and uncorrelated disorder is that in the latter case the equipotentials from the different layers , may cross each other after projection on the same plane .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . as a result of such a crossing",
    ", there is a finite probability for an electron to change equipotential ( and , correspondingly , the plane ) .",
    "obviously , this probability increases with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "we will show that the probability @xmath7 , for an electron to stay within the same equipotential after crossing , is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the magnetic length and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the drift velocities of an electron along the first and the second equipotentials respectively .",
    "these velocities are related to the values @xmath12 , @xmath13 of the electric field in each of the planes at the point of crossing as : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the magnetic field perpendicular to the planes",
    ". then we can rewrite ( [ p ] ) as @xmath16 .",
    "this sets a relevant scale for @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , the fields @xmath17 can be estimated as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the correlation radius of a smooth potential .",
    "[ fig.1 ] = 3.5 in    thus we see , that the probability to retain equipotential is close to @xmath20 if @xmath21 . in the opposite case , @xmath22 , practically each crossing results in the change of equipotential .",
    "it is very important that the crossover value @xmath23 is much smaller than @xmath24 if the disorder is smooth .",
    "this implies that , as @xmath6 gradually increases , the regime when the equipotential is switched with probability close to @xmath20 establishes already at rather small values of @xmath6 , where the density of states still represents a single peak .",
    "the applicability of the formula ( [ p ] ) to the double  layer system with uncorrelated random potential is limited by the condition @xmath25 .",
    "this is because in the derivation of ( [ p ] ) it was assumed that electric fields @xmath26 , @xmath27 are constant within the entire region where the `` interaction '' between equipotentials occurs .",
    "one can see from the derivation presented below , that this region is of the order of the magnetic length when @xmath28 , i.e. when @xmath7 is close to @xmath20 .",
    "however , in the opposite limit , @xmath29 , which corresponds to the strong coupling , the extension of the interaction region is of the order of @xmath30 and is much larger than @xmath9 . on the other hand , for eq.([p ] ) to be relevant , this extension should be much smaller than @xmath19 , which leads us to the condition @xmath25 .",
    "note that for @xmath31 , the language of symmetric and antisymmetric states becomes adequate .",
    "then , similarly to the case of the short  range disorder , the density of states represents two peaks , each having a delocalized state in the center .",
    "thus , we have established that in a wide region @xmath32 , each crossing of equipotential lines from different planes leads to the change of the plane , in which the electron moves . as a result ,",
    "the saddle points @xcite of the random potentials @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the planes , which played a crucial role for delocalization at @xmath35 , become irrelevant in this region ( a typical saddle point would be bypassed due to switching of equipotentials , see fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] = 3.3 in    it appears that within the region @xmath36 , the delocalized states have completely different structure than at @xmath35 .",
    "their energy positions , measured from the center of landau level , are @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is of the order of the width of the landau level @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and they are composed of alternating pieces of compact loops , which are equipotentials @xmath39 and @xmath40 for one state and @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the other state . to justify this scenario ,",
    "assume first that energy @xmath43 is deep in the tail of the landau level .",
    "then the equipotentials @xmath44 and @xmath45 , being projected on the same plane , represent a set of isolated circles . as @xmath43 moves up ,",
    "the equipotentials , corresponding to different planes , start to overlap and form clusters , as it is shown in fig .",
    "it is important that , due to switching of equipotentials at intersections , the motion of an electron within a cluster occurs either inside the cluster or along its boundary ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . as @xmath43 further increases , the average size ( correlation radius ) of the clusters grows and , at some @xmath46 , the classical percolation occurs . as the energy sweeps through @xmath38 , critical clusters first come close , touch each other , and , finally , merge .    to describe the corresponding change in the electronic states , quantum mechanics becomes important .",
    "we will show that there is a complete correspondence between a region of touching of equipotentials and a conventional saddle point .",
    "namely , the transmission coefficient , defined as a probability for an electron to change the cluster while passing through the region of touching , has the same form as the transmission coefficient of a saddle point@xcite @xmath47},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the `` height '' of the effective saddle point and it differs from the value of potential at the point of touching by an amount of the order of @xmath6 . for the characteristic energy @xmath49 we derive below an estimate : @xmath50 .",
    "it is easy to see that in the region @xmath36 one has @xmath51 .",
    "thus we see , that the description of delocalization at @xmath52 reduces to a single  channel network model with critical clusters , playing the role of links , and the regions of touching acting as nodes .",
    "[ fig.3 ] = 3.3 in    this implies that the delocalized states have the same critical exponent of the localization length @xcite , @xmath53 , as in an isolated layer .",
    "the magnitude of the localization length can be estimated as follows .",
    "quantum mechanical description of the transmission through the effective saddle point becomes important when @xmath54 .",
    "the size of the `` unit cell '' of the network for @xmath55 is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the critical exponent for the classical percolation .",
    "then we have , @xmath58    as @xmath6 becomes smaller than @xmath59 , the above picture of electronic states is not valid anymore . a typical crossing of equipotentials",
    "would not cause the change of the plane for the electron motion .",
    "we can present only a plausible argument about the evolution of the positions of delocalized states in this limit .",
    "note that , although a typical crossing is not efficient for @xmath60 , the regions of touching of equipotentials from different planes still act as saddle points .",
    "it will be shown below that the corresponding condition on @xmath6 is @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in the domain @xmath62 , these effective saddle points would couple electronic states belonging to closed equipotentials from different planes . as a result",
    ", the delocalized states would occur at energies @xmath63 , at which the size of a closed equipotential , @xmath64 , is big enough to have @xmath65 effective saddle point somewhere on its perimeter .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath66 .",
    "then the problem again reduces to a single  channel network model with the cells of the network being closed equipotentials , alternatingly , from the first and from the second layer , and the nodes being the effective saddle points .",
    "[ fig.4 ] = 3.3 in    to estimate the magnitude of @xmath67 note that the perimeter of critical equipotential scales with energy as@xcite : @xmath68 .",
    "the probability that two equipotentials from different layers would come close and form an effective saddle point with height within the interval @xmath69 can be estimated as @xmath70 .",

    ", it should be allowed for two equipotentials , corresponding to the same energy , to be displaced by more than a magnetic length .",
    "then our picture remains valid , but the correlation would lead to the shift of the percolation threshold to an energy much closer to the center of the landau level , than in the case of uncorrelated disorder .",

    "3 would become lower , and hence , narrower .    in the paper",
    "we demonstrate that when the tunnel integral exceeds the characteristic value @xmath59 , the critical exponent , @xmath172 , of the localization length is the same as for @xmath35 .",

    "however , it seems more likely that the description in terms of a single  channel network model with neighboring cells belonging to different layers applies even at very small @xmath6 .",
    "the reason why we anticipate this is the following .",
    "the solution of the model problem in sect .",
    "[ sp ] shows that if two minima of the random potential in different layers are located anomalously close to each other ( @xmath176 in ( [ esp1]),([esp2 ] ) ) are anomalously small ) , then the formation of the effective saddle point becomes possible _ even at very small _ @xmath6 .",
    "certainly , the smaller is @xmath6 , more sparse these saddle points are . at @xmath35 the localization length increases in each layer as @xmath177 , and each localized state consists of many cells of the intralayer network , separated by saddle points .",
    "then , if @xmath6 is finite and very small , at some @xmath178 there will be @xmath65 effective saddle point per perimeter of a localized state in each layer . at this energy ( as well as at @xmath179 ) the states in two layers would form a new network with a much larger unit cell @xmath180 .",
    "then the localization length would behave as @xmath181 with a prefactor much bigger than that for a single layer .",
    "certainly , this scenario is only hypothetical .",
    "note that there is a significant difference between our picture and the one outlined by srensen and macdonald @xcite .",
    "the line of argument in ref .",
    "is as follows . in the absence of a disorder",
    "an electron residing initially , say , in the first layer , would oscillate between the layers with a period @xmath182 .",
    "when the disorder is present , the electron drifts within the layer with velocity @xmath183 .",
    "it was assumed in ref . that the change of the layers would most probably occur after an electron travels the distance @xmath184 . in our picture the possibility for an electron in the first layer to tunnel depends on the actual topography of the random potential in the second layer .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    ", in our picture the change of the layers occurs locally , at the intersections of equipotentials with the same energy .",
    "at the same time in the regime of strong coupling , @xmath185 , that we considered , the distance ( in the vicinity of an intersection ) , over which the change of the layers takes place , is @xmath186 and it is much larger than @xmath187 .",
    "our picture also differs from that by laikhtman and menashe@xcite . similarly to ref . , they assume that the process of changing layers , during the drift along the equipotential , occurs homogeneously , but they get a different estimate for the characteristic length of travel within a given layer . their estimate , @xmath188 , is larger than @xmath189 and , correspondingly , larger than @xmath187 .    the authors are grateful to t. v. shahbazyan for reading the manuscript and valuable remarks",
