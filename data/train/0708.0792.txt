    "the large elliptic flow @xmath0 observed in rhic heavy ion collisions compared to lower energies and to hydro predictions is said to reveal a `` perfect liquid ''  @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow is interpreted as a hydrodynamic response to early pressure and the azimuthal eccentricity @xmath1 of the initial system  @xcite . in the hydrodynamic ( hydro ) model of nuclear collisions",
    "large flow values imply small viscosity and rapid thermalization  @xcite .",
    "however , the applicability of a hydrodynamical model to nuclear collisions and the true nature of the azimuth quadrupole interpreted as elliptic flow can be questioned . in this paper",
    "i examine analysis techniques and interpretations leading to `` perfect liquid '' and describe some alternatives .",
    "the conventional flow argument is summarized as follows  @xcite : azimuthal asymmetry of participant nucleons at initial nuclear contact , copious particle production , subsequent thermalization by rescattering , and hydrodynamic evolution lead to a matching asymmetry in final - state momentum space , providing direct evidence for strong interactions among initially - produced particles ( gluons ) .",
    "thermalization must be rapid because hydro expansion reduces the initial space asymmetry .",
    "the argued connection between initial and final states through rapid thermalization is thus demonstrated by large elliptic flow and the apparent success of the hydro model , especially the relation @xmath2 for ideal hydro .",
    "it follows that participant - geometry ( eccentricity ) fluctuations and flow fluctuations should manifest the same @xmath2 relationship .",
    "recent participant - based eccentricity models seem to unify flow measurements across collision systems  @xcite , and flow fluctuation measurements seem to provide an exact connection between flow measure @xmath0 and _ participant _ eccentricity @xmath3  @xcite . however , modeling low-@xmath4 partons with a participant - nucleon eccentricity is questionable at mid - rapidity , and the true magnitude of @xmath0 fluctuations remains unclear .",
    "observation of the trend @xmath2 would demonstrate that hi collisions at rhic produce a thermalized qcd medium ( quark - gluon plasma or variant ) according to ideal hydro  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results suggest that @xmath2 has been achieved  @xcite",
    ". however , there remain open issues : 1 ) conventional flow measure @xmath0 , motivated by the hydro scenario  @xcite , admits significant statistical bias ( systematic error in numerical procedures ) , especially for smaller event multiplicities , and is difficult to interpret  @xcite .",
    "2 ) conventional flow measurements do not distinguish reliably between flow and `` nonflow , '' identified as angular correlations from low-@xmath5 parton ( gluon ) fragmentation or _ minijets _",
    "3 ) flow fluctuation measurements have been based on assumptions about `` nonflow '' known to be invalid from minijet studies .",
    "\\4 ) recent a - a eccentricity definitions are based on simulated distributions of point - like participant nucleons . modeling the transverse distribution of low-@xmath4 partons at rhic midrapidity with point - like nucleons is questionable .",
    "are assumptions and results consistent with known parton distributions , with the concept of a color - glass condensate ?",
    "5 ) conventional flow measurements and terminology are strongly model dependent .",
    "imposition of an _ a priori _ hydro model on data may obscure more fundamental processes .",
    "two new initiatives are needed .",
    "first , alternative physical mechanisms for azimuth multipoles should be explored .",
    "we should consider the analog in qcd to multipole radiation fields in electromagnetism , especially given the non - abelian nature of the gluonic field .",
    "what is the long - wavelength limit of qcd , the equivalent of maxwell s equations ?",
    "a static - field limit in the form of a color - glass condensate ( cgc ) has been introduced  @xcite , but its dynamical implications have not been fully explored .",
    "gluonic multipole fields may play a significant role in nuclear collisions and may produce strong azimuth correlations .",
    "second , new correlation analysis methods include a model - independent statistical measure and analysis procedure which reliably distinguish the azimuth quadrupole moment ( model - independent terminology ) attributed to elliptic flow from `` nonflow ''  @xcite .",
    "accurate measurements of the azimuth quadrupole over a range of centralities , energies and nuclear sizes may provide new insights into the phenomenon described as elliptic flow .",
    "in this paper i review conventional and 2d autocorrelation analysis methods applied to measurement of elliptic flow or the azimuth quadrupole component , including power spectra , pearson s normalized covariance and improved a - a centrality methods  @xcite .",
    "i review two approaches to a - a eccentricity simulation and advocate the optical glauber model .",
    "i compare published star @xmath0 data and fits to simulated 2d angular autocorrelations .",
    "i conclude that what is termed `` nonflow '' is dominated by the same - side minijet peak ( jet cone ) and that there may be a simple relationship between the true azimuth quadrupole moment and initial - state geometry parameters .",
    "i show that recently claimed large flow fluctuations are probably dominated by minijets .",
    "finally , i review problematic issues for hydrodynamic models and suggest that the azimuth quadrupole is actually a manifestation of qcd field - field interactions , possibly related to longitudinal filimentation and instabilities , that elliptic flow is actually gluonic multipole radiation .",
