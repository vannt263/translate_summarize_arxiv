    "the singularity structure of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations in the complex plane is not a well understood subject .",

    "the goal of the present paper is to develop a relatively general and constructive technique to address this issue , which applies to equations that admit formal asymptotic solutions .    in view of the complexity of the analysis , and for more clarity ,",
    "we describe and apply the method on a number of concrete problems .",
    "it will be however transparent that the method is much more general .",

    "we prove that complex singularities of these formal asymptotic solution actually correspond to singularities of the solution of the full pde .",
    "the motivation for understanding complex singularity formation of pdes , aside from intrinsic interest , is that in some cases of physical interest @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , there is evidence that singularities that appear in the real physical domain after a finite time can be traced to the complex plane .",
    "the procedure consists in the following steps : ( i ) an early time asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath1 , the validity of which is justified for the modified harry - dym equation in @xcite , ( ii ) introduction of appropriately scaled ",
    "inner \" dependent and independent variables beyond the region of validity of the expansion ( i ) , ( iii ) determination of singularities of the leading order equation and ( iv ) proof that a secondary expansion in scaled time , involving inner - variables , is convergent in a domain encircling a singularity of the leading order solution .",
    "insofar as analysis of the leading order equation ( in step ( iii ) above ) is concerned , which ( typically a nonlinear ode ) , formal calculations have been used before ( see @xcite , and references in @xcite ) .",
    "these can now be rigorously derived from the general theory introduced in @xcite .",
    "the present paper justifies the above four step procedure for the modified harry - dym equation this equation arises in the small surface tension limit of hele - shaw interfacial evolution @xcite in the neighborhood of an initial zero of the derivative of an associated conformal map .",
