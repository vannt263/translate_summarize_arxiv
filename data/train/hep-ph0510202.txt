    "the experimental evidence for pentaquarks is now considered to be weak . however the strong statement that they do not exist can only be made after tests , which are presently being carried on @xcite . even if this state turns out to be unreal , its study generated many new theoretical ideas which can be valuable in the future @xcite .",
    "one of the most puzzling characteristics of the pentaquark is its extremely small width ( much ) below 10 mev which poses a serious challenge to all theoretical models .",
    "many explanations for this narrow width have been advanced @xcite . in this work",
    "we calculate the pentaquark decay width within the framework of qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite .",
    "several sum rule calculations have been performed for the mass of the pentaquark containing a strange quark @xcite .",
    "these calculations are based on two - point functions with different interpolating currents .",
    "surprisingly , all these determinations give similar masses with reasonable values .",
    "a common problem of all determinations is the large continuum contribution which has its origin in the high dimension of the interpolating currents and results in a large dependence on the continuum threshold .",
    "another problem is the irregular behavior of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , which is dominated by higher dimension operators and not by the perturbative term as it should be .    here",
    "we present a sum rule determination for the decay width based on a three - point function for the decay @xmath2 . in this way we can extract the coupling @xmath3 which is directly related to the pentaquark width . to describe the pentaquark we use the diquark - diquark - antiquark model with one scalar and one pseudoscalar diquark in a relative s - wave .",
    "in @xcite it has been argued that such a small decay width can only be explained if the pentaquark is a genuine 5-quark state , i.e. , it contains no color singlet meson - baryon contributions and thus color exchange is necessary for the decay .",
    "the analysis presented both in @xcite and in @xcite is only qualitative .",
    "the narrowness of the pentaquark width can then be attributed to the non - trivial color structure of the pentaquark which requires the exchange of , at least , one gluon . in this work",
    "we will also test quantitatively the hypothesis put forward in @xcite to see whether this mechanism is sufficient to explain the small width .",
    "the investigation of the pentaquark decay width requires a three - point function which we define as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the interpolating fields associated with neutron , kaon and @xmath8 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we next consider the expression ( [ correl ] ) in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom and write the phenomenological side of the sum rule . treating the kaon as a pseudoscalar particle ,",
    "the interaction between the three hadrons is described by the following lagrangian density : @xmath9 writing the correlation function ( [ correl ] ) in momentum space and inserting complete sets of hadronic states we obtain an expression which depends on the following matrix elements : @xmath10 using the simple feynman rules derived from ( [ lag ] ) we can rewrite @xmath11 as @xmath12 the coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be determined from the qcd sum rules of the corresponding two - point functions .",
    "@xmath15 is related to the kaon decay constant through @xmath16 combining the expressions above we arrive at @xmath17 with @xmath18 we shall work with the @xmath19 structure because , as it was shown in @xcite , this structure gives results which are less sensitive to the coupling scheme on the phenomenological side , i.e. , to the choice of a pseudoscalar or pseudovector coupling between the kaon and the baryons .",
    "we now come back to ( [ correl ] ) and write the interpolating fields in terms of quark degrees of freedom as @xmath20   [ \\bar{d}_b(0)c\\bar{u}^{t}_a(0)]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pentaquark current above ( proposed in @xcite ) contains a pseudoscalar and a scalar diquark . with these diquarks",
    "the two point function might receive a significant contribution from instantons . in @xcite",
    "we have studied a situation in which these instanton contributions affected the two - point function but gave a negligible contribution to the three - point function . moreover , in @xcite we have observed that instantons give a negligible contribution to heavy baryon weak decays .",
    "motivated by these results , in this first calculation we shall neglect instantons .    inserting the currents into ( [ correl ] ) ,",
    "the resulting expression involves the quark propagator in the presence of quark and gluon condensates , which is known from previous studies . using it we arrive at a final complicated expression for the correlator , which is represented schematically by the sum of the diagrams of fig . 1 .",
    "let us consider the phenomenological side ( [ vfen3 ] ) and , following @xcite , rewrite it generically as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the pole - pole part and reads @xmath23 the continuum - continuum term @xmath24 can be obtained as usual , with the assumption of quark - hadron duality @xcite .",
    "the pole - continuum transition terms are contained in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they can be explicitly written as a double dispersion integral : @xmath27    since there is no theoretical tool to calculate the unknown functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 explicitly , one has to employ a parametrization for these terms .",
    "we will use two different parametrizations : one with a continuous function for the @xmath8 and one where the pole term is singled out .",
    "we shall assume that the functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 have the following form : @xmath32 with continuous functions @xmath33 , starting from @xmath34 .",
    "this is our * parametrization a*. the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 describe the excitation spectra of the kaon and the nucleon , respectively .",
    "after borel transform , the pole - continuum term contains one unknown constant factor which can be determined from the sum rules .    in order to investigate the role played by the @xmath8 continuum",
    ", we shall now explicitly force the phenomenological side to contain only the pole part of the @xmath8 , both in the pole - pole term and in the pole - continuum terms .",
    "this can formally be done by choosing @xmath37 in ( [ b1b2 ] ) and the functions then read : @xmath38 this is our * parametrization b*. in this case we have the @xmath8 in the ground state . again , in the final expressions this gives additional constants which can be calculated .",
    "the sum rule may be written identifying the phenomenological and theoretical descriptions of the correlation function .",
    "as mentioned above , we shall work with the @xmath19 structure . in the case of the three - point function",
    "considered here , there are two independent momenta and we may perform either a single or a double borel transform .",
    "we first consider the choice : @xmath39 and perform a single borel transform : @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in this case",
    "we take @xmath42 and single out the @xmath43-terms .",
    "the second choice is : @xmath44 here we perform two borel transforms : @xmath40 and @xmath41 and also @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we have also considered the choice @xmath47 , performing one single borel transform ( @xmath41 ) . however , in the present calculation we were not able to find a stable sum rule . introducing the notation @xmath48 and using ( i ) and ( ii ) we obtain the following sum rules :    * method i : * @xmath49 with @xmath50 and for the pole - continuum part we obtain @xmath51 in both parametrizations the term @xmath25",
    "is exponentially suppressed and , as discussed in @xcite , has been neglected .",
    "@xmath52 is an unknown constant and can be determined from the sum rules .",
    "* method ii * @xmath53 @xmath54 with @xmath55 and with @xmath56 for parametrization a and @xmath57 for parametrization b. also in this case @xmath25 is exponentially suppressed . in the above expressions @xmath58",
    "is the double discontinuity computed directly from the theoretical ( ope ) description of the correlation function ( see @xcite for details and also @xcite ) and @xmath59 is the continuum threshold of the nucleon defined as @xmath60 .",
    "the hadronic masses are @xmath61 mev , @xmath62 mev , @xmath63 mev and @xmath64 mev . for each of the sum rules above ( eqs .",
    "( [ soma1 ] ) and ( [ soma2 ] ) ) we can take the derivative with respect to @xmath65 and in this way obtain a second sum rule . in each case",
    "we have thus a system of two equations and two unknowns ( @xmath66 and @xmath52 ) which can then be easily solved .    in the numerical analysis of the sum rules we use the following values for the condensates : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the gluon condensate has a large error of about a factor 2 , but its influence on the analysis is relatively small .",
    "the couplings constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 are taken from the corresponding two - point functions : @xmath74 @xmath75 the coupling @xmath76 is obtained from ( [ decaek ] ) with @xmath77 mev , @xmath78 mev and @xmath79 mev : @xmath80    in fig . 1 , among these ope diagrams there are two distinct subsets . in the first ( from 1a to 1 g )",
    "there is no gluon line connecting the petals and therefore no color exchange . a diagram of this type we call color - disconnected . in the second subset of diagrams ( 1h , 1i and 1j ) we have color exchange .",
    "if there is no color exchange , the final state containing two color singlets was already present in the initial state , before the decay , as noticed in @xcite . in this case",
    "the pentaquark had a component similar to a @xmath81 molecule . in the second case",
    "the pentaquark was a genuine 5-quark state with a non - trivial color structure .",
    "we may call this type of diagram a color - connected ( cc ) one . in our analysis",
    "we write sum rules for both cases : all diagrams and only color - connected .",
    "the former case is standard in qcdsr calculations and therefore we shall omit details and present only the results .",
    "the latter case implies that the pentaquark is a genuine 5-quark state and the evaluation of @xmath1 will thus be based only on the cc diagrams .",
    "we shall work in the borel window given by @xmath82 . since the strange mass is small , the dominating diagram is fig .",
    "1b of dimension three with one quark condensate . in the range",
    "considered , the dimension 5 condensates are substantially suppressed compared to this term .    we have found out that the contribution from the pole - continuum part is of a similar size as the pole part . for lower values of @xmath83 around 1 gev@xmath84 , the pole contribution dominates , however , for larger values of @xmath83 the importance of the pole - continuum contribution grows and eventually becomes larger than the pole part .",
    "this is an additional reason to restrict the analysis to small values for the borel parameters .",
    "we have evaluated the sum rules for the coupling constant computed with all diagrams of fig . 1 and we have found that they are very stable . we give the values of the coupling extracted at @xmath85 gev@xmath84 and @xmath86 gev@xmath84 in table i. in what follows we shall present our results for the coupling constant @xmath3 obtained with the color connected diagrams only . in fig .",
    "2 we show the coupling , given by the solution of the sum rule i a ( [ soma1 ] ) , as a function of the borel mass squared @xmath83 .",
    "different lines show different values of the continuum threshold @xmath87 .",
    "as it can be seen , @xmath3 is remarkably stable with respect to variations both in @xmath83 and in @xmath87 . in fig .",
    "3 we show the coupling obtained with the sum rule ii a ( [ soma2 ] ) .",
    "we find again fairly stable results which are very weakly dependent on the continuum threshold . in fig .",
    "4 we show the results of the sum rule i b. in fig .",
    "5 we present the result of the sum rule ii b. the meaning of the different lines is the same as in the previous figures .",
    "the results are similar to the cases before .    in table",
    "i we present a summary of our results for @xmath3 giving emphasis to the difference between the results obtained with all diagrams and with only the color - connected ones . for the continuum thresholds",
    "we have employed @xmath88 gev .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for our final value of @xmath1 we take an average of the sum rules i a - ii b. it is interesting to observe that the influence of the continuum threshold is relatively small , especially when compared to the corresponding two - point functions .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the continuum thresholds , in the coupling constants @xmath89 and in the quark condensate we get an uncertainty of about 50% .",
    "our final result then reads : @xmath90 including all diagrams , the prediction for @xmath91 is then 13 mev ( 652 mev ) for a positive ( negative ) parity pentaquark . in the cc case",
    "we get a width of 0.75 mev ( 37 mev ) for a positive ( negative ) parity pentaquark",
    ". the measured upper limit of the width is around 5 - 10 mev both in the kn channel ( considered here ) and in the kp channel .",
    "we see that it is very difficult to obtain the measured decay width for a negative parity pentaquark .",
    "we have presented a qcd sum rule study of the decay of the @xmath92 pentaquark using a diquark - diquark - antiquark scheme with one scalar and one pseudoscalar diquark . based on the evaluation of the relevant three - point function ,",
    "we have computed the coupling constant @xmath1 . in the operator product expansion",
    "we have included all diagrams up to dimension 5 . in this particular type of sum rule",
    "a complication arises from the pole - continuum transitions which are not exponentially suppressed after borel transformation and must be explicitly included .",
    "the analysis was made for two different pole - continuum parametrizations and in two different evaluation schemes .",
    "the results are consistent with each other . in addition",
    ", we have tested the ideas presented in @xcite by including only diagrams with color exchange .",
    "our final results are given in eq .",
    "( [ gfinal ] ) .",
    "we find that for a positive parity pentaquark a width much smaller than 10 mev would indicate a pentaquark which contains no color - singlet meson - baryon contribution .",
