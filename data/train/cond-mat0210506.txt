    "the close connection between symmetry and degeneracy has been explored since the very foundation of quantum mechanics .",
    "famous examples include degeneracies of the energy spectra in angular momentum in the 3d harmonic oscillator @xcite and in the hydrogen atom ( well known as the accidental degeneracy ) @xcite . here",
    "we undertake a detailed study of the connection between symmetries and degeneracies of a hamiltonian that describes the exchange interaction of two spins , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and also includes zeeman splitting for spin @xmath5 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is arbitrary .",
    "our interest in this system was motivated by experiments @xcite on spin relaxation in polarized alkali - metal vapors . in this case",
    "@xmath5 has a meaning of the total electronic spin , @xmath6 is the nuclear spin , and the dimensionless constant @xmath10 represents the magnetic field . a diagram of energy levels of hamiltonian ( [ hx ] ) for a typical value of @xmath11 is shown on fig .  [ levels ] .",
    "in addition to degeneracies at @xmath12 ( no zeeman splitting ) the spectrum displays less trivial @xmath13-fold degeneracies at @xmath14 .",
    "these degeneracies show up as resonances in the spin relaxation rate and provide the key evidence for a particular mechanism of spin relaxation ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the degeneracies at @xmath14 have been also discussed in @xcite .    despite the simplicity of hamiltonian ( [ hx ] )",
    ", it is not trivial to determine its symmetry at @xmath15 . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there is no general textbook algorithm for extracting symmetries . in this paper",
    "we propose such an algorithm .",
    "we demonstrate how , using only a minimal intuition into the reasons for degeneracy , one can find hidden symmetries whenever the eigenstates and the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are known .",
    "15 cm    before proceeding further let us formulate the general problem of identifying the symmetry responsible for a particular spectral degeneracy .",
    "symmetries manifest themselves through operators that commute with the hamiltonian , @xmath16 .",
    "consider a set of these operators @xmath17 .",
    "if not all of the operators @xmath18 commute with each other , this symmetry implies some spectral degeneracy .",
    "indeed , if @xmath19=[\\hat a_j , \\hat h]=0\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad [ \\hat a_i , \\hat a_j]\\ne0 , \\label{triv}\\ ] ] there exists an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath20 for which @xmath21 .",
    "this state is necessarily degenerate , since according to equation ( [ triv ] ) @xmath22 and @xmath23 are eigenstates of @xmath16 of the same energy as @xmath20 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "is a particular set of operators @xmath24 sufficient to account for given spectral degeneracies ?",
    "the positive answer to this question implies that    1 .",
    "all degenerate states can be labelled by eigenvalues of a number of mutually commuting operators from the set @xmath24 2",
    ".   any degenerate state can be obtained from any other state in the same eigenspace by a repeated action of operators @xmath18 or their linear combinations .",
    "provided that conditions 1 ) and 2 ) are met one can complete the analysis by clarifying the physical significance of operators @xmath25 .",
    "an additional , more abstract , question one might ask is what is the group generated by operators @xmath26 .",
    "consider for example the degeneracy of hamiltonian ( [ hx ] ) at @xmath12 .",
    "one can introduce @xmath27 and identify , e.g. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the commutator of @xmath30 with @xmath31 yields @xmath32 .",
    "eigenvalues of @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be used to label the degenerate states , while linear combinations of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , connect all degenerate states in a given eigenspace . finally , any operator that commutes with @xmath39 can be written in terms of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the group generated by the components of @xmath40 is @xmath0 and the group elements have a meaning of rotations in 3d space .",
    "frequently , we encounter a situation when the spectrum is known exactly and yet the symmetries are hidden . in such cases the following formal expression for commuting operators serves as a useful starting point .",
    "one can show quite generally that , up to an operator that annihilates all degenerate states , all integrals of motion must be of the form @xmath41 here @xmath42 is an operator that projects out the @xmath43th degenerate eigenspace and @xmath44 is an arbitrary operator .",
    "we prove equation ( [ main ] ) in the appendix .",
    "the problem of finding the symmetry thus reduces to making appropriate choices for @xmath44 .",
    "this choice can be either guided by limiting cases , e.g. , the classical limit , where the symmetry is simple to identify , or by an intuition as to what type of conservation laws ( e.g. scalars or vectors or etc . )",
    "one expects to find .",
    "however , examples we considered show that many apparently different choices for the operator @xmath44 produce equivalent conservation laws .",
    "thus , it is usually sufficient to explore the simplest options - the basic operators of the problem .",
    "for example , if the hamiltonian is written in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , natural choices for @xmath44 would be @xmath47 and @xmath48 if one is looking for a conserved scalar or @xmath45 and @xmath46 if a conserved vector is expected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we determine and analyze in detail the spectrum of hamiltonian ( [ hx ] ) at @xmath15 ( section 2 ) .",
    "we show that , apart from the zero field degeneracy at @xmath12 , there are degeneracies only at @xmath14 , the spectrum at @xmath49 being simply related to that at @xmath15 . given the eigenstates , integrals of motion ( [ main ] ) can be evaluated without knowing projectors @xmath42 explicitly . in this case",
    "the general strategy is to compute the matrix elements of @xmath50 in equation ( [ main ] ) and use them to determine @xmath50 in terms of basic operators of the problem .",
    "we will illustrate this approach in section 6 .",
    "in section 3 we use ( [ main ] ) to explicitly derive commuting operators that connect all degenerate states at @xmath15 . we demonstrate that the symmetry group of hamiltonian ( [ hx ] ) at @xmath15 is @xmath0 . the physical meaning of symmetry operators is clarified in section 4 , where we consider the limit of large @xmath9 .    in section 5 we rewrite the hamiltonian in the form that makes the analogy to the large @xmath9 limit particularly clear and allows us to establish some additional properties of the energy spectrum . in section 6 we provide another example of the general approach of finding symmetries based on ( [ main ] ) by deriving the runge - lenz vector from ( [ main ] ) .",
    "here we analyze the spectrum of hamiltonian ( [ hx ] ) at arbitrary @xmath10 and consider in detail the spectrum at @xmath15 .",

    "the block @xmath243 corresponds to the degenerate subspace , @xmath241 to the remaining levels . since any matrix commutes with an identity matrix and only diagonal matrices commute with @xmath241 , an operator @xmath50 commutes with the hamiltonian if and only if it is of the form @xmath244= \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      \\cal{a } &   0 \\\\ & \\\\    0 &    0\\\\ \\end{array}\\right ] + \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }     0 &   0 \\\\ & \\\\    0 &    \\cal{d}'\\\\ \\end{array}\\right ] \\label{comgenmat}\\ ] ] where @xmath245 is an arbitrary @xmath240 matrix and @xmath246 is a diagonal matrix of an appropriate size . using the projection operator @xmath88 , we can rewrite ( [ comgenmat ] ) as @xmath247 where @xmath44 is an arbitrary operator and @xmath248 represents the second operator on the left hand side of equation ( [ comgenmat ] ) . the action of the operator @xmath248 on the degenerate subspace is trivial .",
