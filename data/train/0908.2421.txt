    "the linear feature seamlessly connects with the shell snr  , which is brightest in the area near the point of apparent contact ( left panel of figure  [ fig : snr ] ) , suggesting a physical connection . by analogy with well - studied examples of pulsars and their bow shock pwne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we infer that the long non - thermal nebula trailing  is caused by its shocked relativistic wind as the pulsar moves supersonically through the local ism and away from snr  .    the pulsar / snr association is located in the direction of the crux spiral arm . at a distance of 8kpc ( according to the ne2001 model of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this system is on the inside edge of the arm .",

    ". if the ne2001 model crux arm has a smaller electron density than the real arm or does not extend as far in width , it is entirely possible that the true pulsar distance is as small as 6kpc .",

    "is located @xmath9 ( @xmath56pc ) from the geometric center of the shell , its putative place of birth . for a true age @xmath57 , parameterized as @xmath58 ,",
    "the pulsar velocity in the plane of the sky is @xmath59 , which is a perfectly reasonable velocity for a young neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for almost any ism phase ,",
    "this is also a highly supersonic velocity .",
    "while @xmath60  is a plausible velocity for a young pulsar , we now consider the possibility that for  the true velocity may be substantially larger .",
    "we know little about the ism density near snr  , but it seems reasonable to question whether the age of the snr really is as large as 114kyr , especially in view of its relatively undisturbed , if incomplete , circular symmetry .",
    "also , the snr shell radius , @xmath61pc , may be small for such a large age : for adiabatic expansion , the sedov solution implies @xmath62kyr , for a hydrogen ambient medium of density @xmath63@xmath64 and sn explosion kinetic energy of @xmath65erg ( a search for thermal x - rays from the snr could provide useful constraints on its age ) .",
    "in addition , for the nominal age , the long pulsar wind trail ( of length @xmath66pc ) must have remained remarkably collimated for about 50kyr .",
    "a detailed study of the pwn ( now underway using the atca ) may find whether this is reasonable . if on the other hand @xmath67 , these possible difficulties disappear . in that case , the pulsar age is @xmath68 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath69 , the implied initial spin period of the neutron star is @xmath70ms .",
    "such relatively large initial periods , close to their current periods , are inferred for other pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this could be the case as well for . and if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 .",
    "the expected proper motion for the pulsar ( or , as its proxy , for the head of the bow shock nebula ) is @xmath73masyr@xmath48 .",
    "if indeed @xmath74 , this could be measurable with the atca .",
    "thus , multiwavelength observations of snr  , its associated , and its bow shock pwn , may usefully constrain the properties of this newly identified system , and put it into context in the zoo of young neutron stars and their environments .",
    "radio luminosity at 1.4ghz ( @xmath75 ) vs.  characteristic age ( @xmath5 ) for 1259 pulsars in the galactic disk with @xmath76yr .",

    "has a very small flux density , and it is not surprising that it was not identified previously in relatively shallow undirected surveys .",
    "its location was observed in the parkes multibeam survey of the galactic plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
