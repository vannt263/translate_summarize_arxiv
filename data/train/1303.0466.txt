    "many studies using magnetoresistance ( mr ) measurements have quantitatively identified the gcf in both conventional  @xcite and high-@xmath0  ( ref .  )",
    "more recently , the nernst effect has become a common probe of scf , and has been used to observe amplitude fluctuations over a broad range of temperatures above @xmath0 in nbsi  ( refs .  ) and a crossover between amplitude and phase fluctuations in ino@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "in addition , nernst measurements have supported claims of vortex physics in high-@xmath0 compounds above @xmath0  ( ref .  ) and competing order , leading to reductions of @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "several of these studies revealed a peak in the nernst effect in both high-@xmath0  ( ref .  ) and conventional thin film  @xcite superconductors ; this peak was associated with the gcf by many authors , although other interpretations have also been advanced .",

    "the dimensionality for localization phenomena such as weak antilocalization ( wal ) is determined by the dephasing length @xmath27 , related to the phase breaking time @xmath28 through @xmath29 .",
    "the phase breaking rate is sensitive to both inelastic scattering ( with lifetime @xmath30 ) and temperature - independent processes such as spin - flip scattering , however , we find no evidence for this latter contribution to dephasing . since @xmath30 generally increases with decreasing temperature , @xmath31 grows longer as the temperature is reduced and 2d behavior should emerge for sufficiently low @xmath32 .",
    "based on the value of @xmath31  =  10 nm at 20 k determined from wal magnetoconductance ( mc ) fits , we conclude that this film is 2d with respect to wal at and below 20 k.    for sufficiently large magnetic fields the characteristic magnetic length @xmath33 will be smaller than the film thickness and thus lead to behavior that is not strictly 2d .",
    "however , the magnetic length is equal to our @xmath34 4-nm film thickness at @xmath34 10 t ; this is greater than the maximum magnetic fields used in most of this work ( @xmath34 8 t ) . finally , the mean free path @xmath35 0.1 nm is much less than the film thickness , and so the classical diffusive electronic motion is three dimensional ( 3d ) .",

    "this is consistent with theoretical predictions for the hall effect  @xcite and with our findings , however it is inconsistent with the gl theory scaling for @xmath4 above and below @xmath0 that should relate @xmath1 and the gcf .",
    "@xcite consequently , we speculate that the crossover field observed in the nernst studies may similarly represent a different characteristic field scale than the gcf as first described by kapitulnik _",

    "@xcite    to summarize , we have studied the magnetic field scales for the suppression of scf in a disordered thin film .",
    "we observe an enhancement in the hall effect at temperatures above and below @xmath0 , similar in behavior to that seen in several recent studies of transport in disordered and high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "simultaneous measurement of the longitudinal mr , and quantitative analysis using theories for wal and scf contributions to the mc , allow robust extraction of both the dephasing field and the characteristic scf suppression field @xmath2 .",
