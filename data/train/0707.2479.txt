    "studying the dynamics of complex systems is relevant in many scientific fields , from meteorology @xcite over geophysics @xcite to economics @xcite and neuroscience @xcite . in many cases , this complex dynamics",
    "is to be conceived as arising through the interaction of subsystems , and it can be observed in the form of multivariate time series where measurements in different channels are taken from the different parts of the system .",
    "the degree of interaction of two subsystems can then be quantified using bivariate measures of signal interdependence @xcite .",
    "a wide variety of such measures has been proposed , from the classic linear correlation coefficient over frequency - domain variants like magnitude squared coherence @xcite to general entropy - based measures @xcite . a more specific model of complex dynamics that has found a large number of applications is that of a set of self - sustained oscillators whose coupling leads to a synchronization of their rhythms @xcite . especially the discovery of the phenomenon of phase synchronization @xcite led to the widespread use of synchronization indices in time series analysis @xcite .",
    "however , by applying bivariate measures to multivariate data sets an @xmath1-dimensional time series is described by an @xmath2-matrix of bivariate indices , which leads to a large amount of mostly redundant information .",
    "especially if additional parameters come into play ( nonstationarity of the dynamics , external control parameters , experimental conditions ) the quantity of data can be overwhelming .",
    "then it becomes necessary to reduce the complexity of the data set in such a way as to reveal the relevant underlying structures , that is , to use genuinely multivariate analysis methods that are able to detect patterns of multichannel interaction .",
    "one way to do so is to trace the observed pairwise correspondences back to a smaller set of direct interactions using e.g. partial coherence @xcite , an approach that has recently been extended to phase synchronization @xcite .",
    "another and complementary way to achieve such a reduction is cluster analysis , that is , a separation of the parts of the system into different groups , such that signal interdependencies within each group tend to be stronger than in between groups .",
    "this description of the multivariate structure in the form of clusters can eventually be enriched by the specification of a degree of participation of an element in its cluster . the straightforward way to obtain clusters by applying a threshold to the matrix entries",
    "has often been used @xcite , but it is very susceptible to random variation of the indices . as an alternative",
    ", several attempts have recently been made to identify clusters using eigenvectors of the correlation matrix @xcite , which were motivated by the application of random matrix theory to empirical correlation matrices @xcite .    in the context of phase synchronization analysis ,",
    "a first approach to cluster analysis was based on the derivation of a specific model of the internal structure of a synchronization cluster @xcite .",
    "the resulting method made the simplifying assumption of the presence of only one cluster in the given data set , and focused on quantifying the degree of involvement of single oscillators in the global dynamics .",
    "going beyond that , the _ participation index _",
    "method @xcite defined a measure of oscillator involvement based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix of bivariate synchronization indices , and attributed oscillators to synchronization clusters based on this measure .    but",
    "despite the apparent usefulness of eigenvalue decomposition for the purposes of group identification , beyond some phenomenological evidence no good reason has been put forward why an eigenvector of a synchronization matrix should directly indicate the system elements taking part in a cluster . moreover , in a recent survey of the performance of synchronization cluster analysis in simulation and field data @xcite it has been shown that there are important special cases  clusters of similar strength that are slightly synchronized to each other  where the assumed one - to - one correspondence of eigenvectors and clusters is completely lost .    in this paper , we provide a better understanding of the role of eigenvectors in synchronization cluster analysis , and we present an improved method for detecting synchronization clusters , the _ eigenvector space _ approach .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  ii , we briefly recall the definition of the matrix of bivariate synchronization indices @xmath0 as the starting point of the analysis .",
    "we motivate its transformation into a stochastic matrix @xmath3 describing a markov chain and detail the properties of that process . utilizing recent results on the coarse - graining of finite - state markov processes @xcite we derive our method of synchronization cluster analysis , and we illustrate its operation using a system of coupled lorenz oscillators . in section  iii ,",
    "we compare the performance of the eigenvector space method with that of the previous approach , the participation index method @xcite , and we investigate its behavior in the case of small sample size , which is important with regard to the application to empirical data .",
    "synchronization is a generally occurring phenomenon in the natural sciences , which is defined as the dynamical adjustment of the rhythms of different oscillators @xcite . because an oscillatory dynamics is described by a phase variable @xmath4 , a measure of synchronization strength is based on the instantaneous phases @xmath5 of oscillators @xmath6 , where the index @xmath7 enumerates the values in a sample of size @xmath8 .",
    "the nowadays commonly used bivariate index of phase synchronization strength @xcite results from the application of the first empirical moment of a circular random variable @xcite to the distribution of the phase difference of the two oscillators : @xmath9 the measure takes on values from the interval @xmath10 $ ] , representing the continuum from no to perfect synchronization of oscillators @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; the matrix @xmath0 is symmetric , its diagonal being composed of @xmath13s .",
    "special care has to be taken in applying this definition to empirical data , because the interpretation of @xmath0 as a synchronization measure in the strict sense only holds if phase values were obtained from different self - sustained oscillators .",
    "the determination of the phase values @xmath5 generally depends on the kind of system or data to be investigated . for the analysis of scalar real - valued time series @xmath14 that are characterized by a pronounced dominant frequency",
    ", the standard approach utilizes the associated complex - valued analytic signal @xmath15 @xcite , within which every harmonic component of @xmath14 is extended to a complex harmonic .",
    "the analytic signal is commonly defined @xcite as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the hilbert transform of the signal @xmath18 , @xmath19 and where p.v . denotes the cauchy principal value of the integral .",
    "the instantaneous phase of the time series is then defined as @xmath20 equivalently , the analytic signal can be obtained using a filter that removes negative frequency components , @xmath21 ~ \\left [ 1 + \\mathrm{sgn}(\\omega ) \\right ] \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the fourier transform into the domain of frequencies @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes the sign function @xcite .",
    "this definition is more useful in practice because it can be straightforwardly applied to empirical time series , which are sampled at a finite number @xmath8 of discrete time points @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "if several time series ( realizations of the same process ) are available , the obtained phase values can be combined into a single multivariate sample of phases @xmath5 , where the index @xmath27 now enumerates the complete available phase data .      in the participation index method @xcite ,",
    "the use of eigenvectors of @xmath0 for synchronization cluster analysis was motivated by the investigation of the spectral properties of correlation matrices in random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "another context where eigenvalue decomposition turns up naturally is the computation of matrix powers , which becomes as simple as possible using the spectral representation of the matrix .",
    "powers of @xmath0 have a well defined meaning in the special case of a binary - valued matrix ( @xmath28 ) , as it is obtained for instance by thresholding : the matrix entries of @xmath29 count the number of possible paths from one element to another within @xmath30 steps , i.e. , they specify the degree to which these elements are connected via indirect links of synchrony . by analogy ,",
    "we interpret @xmath31 also in the general case as quantifying the degree of common entanglement of two elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 within the same web of synchronization relations . in the following",
    "we will call this quantity the @xmath30-step synchronization strength of two oscillators because it reduces to the original bivariate synchronization strength @xmath32 in the case @xmath33 .",
    "this synchronization strength over @xmath30 steps is relevant for synchronization cluster analysis , because in a system where synchronization clusters are present it is possible that the degree of direct bivariate synchrony of two elements is not very strong , but they are both entangled into the same web of links of synchrony .",
    "these indirect links , which make the two elements members of the same synchronization cluster , become visible in @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , with increasing power @xmath30 the patterns of synchrony within a cluster ( the matrix columns ) become more similar , approaching the form of one of the dominant eigenvectors .",
    "if there are different clusters in the system , a suitable @xmath30 can be chosen such that each cluster exhibits a different pattern , representing the web of synchronization relations it is comprised of .",
    "these patterns constitute _ signatures _ by which elements can be attributed to clusters .",
    "the cluster signatures are related to the dominant eigenvectors of @xmath0 ; by transition to larger @xmath30 they become even more dominant , leading to an effective simplification of the matrix .    for the identification of the members of a cluster",
    "only the patterns of synchrony are relevant , while the absolute size of elements of different columns diverges with @xmath30 , so that some sort of normalization is called for .",
    "different normalization schemes might be used for this purpose . however , using the @xmath34-norm the procedure can be simplified , because for the normalized version of the synchronization matrix , given by @xmath35 it holds that powers of @xmath3 are automatically normalized , too .",
    "moreover , the @xmath34-normalized matrix @xmath3 is a column - stochastic matrix , that is , it can be interpreted as the matrix of @xmath36 transition probabilities describing a markov chain , whose states correspond to the elements of the original system . via this connection",
    ", the tools of stochastic theory and especially recent work on the coarse - graining of finite - state markov processes @xcite can be utilized for the purposes of synchronization cluster analysis .",
    "the markov process defined in this way possesses some specific properties @xcite : it is aperiodic because of the nonzero diagonal entries of the matrix , and it is in general irreducible because the values of empirical @xmath32 for @xmath37 will also almost never be exactly zero . for a finite - state process , these two properties amount to ergodicity , which implies that any distribution over states converges to a unique invariant distribution @xmath38 , corresponding to the eigenvector of @xmath3 for the unique largest eigenvalue @xmath13 .",
    "this distribution can be computed from @xmath0 as @xmath39 where the vector components of @xmath38 are denoted by @xmath40 . with the matrix @xmath0 also",
    "the stationary flow given by @xmath41 is symmetric , i.e. , the process fulfills the condition of detailed balance @xmath42 , which makes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath3 real - valued @xcite .    for the markov process ,",
    "the @xmath30-step synchronization strength considered above translates into transitions between states over a period of @xmath43 time steps . to compute the corresponding transition matrix @xmath44 the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath3 is used . if @xmath45 with @xmath46 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath3 , and the right and left eigenvectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 are scaled such that the orthonormality relation @xmath49 is fulfilled , the spectral representation of @xmath3 is given by @xmath50 and consequently @xmath51 we assume that eigenvalues are sorted such that @xmath52 .",
    "the scaling ambiguity left by the orthonormality relation is resolved by choosing @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the vector components of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ) , which leads to the normalization equations @xmath56 with the special solutions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "additionally , a generalized orthonormality relation @xmath59 follows for the right eigenvectors .",
    "the convergence of every initial distribution to the stationary distribution @xmath38 corresponds to the fact that because of non - vanishing synchronies the whole system ultimately forms one single cluster .",
    "this perspective belongs to a timescale @xmath60 , at which all eigenvalues @xmath61 go to @xmath62 except for the largest one , @xmath63 . in the other extreme of a timescale @xmath64",
    ", @xmath44 becomes the identity matrix , all of its columns are different , and the system disintegrates into as many clusters as there are elements . for the purposes of cluster analysis , intermediate timescales are of interest on which many but not all of the eigenvalues are practically zero .",
    "if we want to identify @xmath65 clusters , we expect to find that many different cluster signatures , and that means we have to consider @xmath44 at a time scale where eigenvalues @xmath61 may be significantly different from zero only for the range @xmath66 .",
    "this is achieved by determining @xmath43 such that @xmath67 . using a parameter @xmath68 chosen to represent the quantity that is considered to be practically zero ( e.g. @xmath69 ) , from @xmath70 we calculate the appropriate timescale for a clustering into @xmath65 clusters as @xmath71 the vanishing of the smaller eigenvalues at a given timescale describes the loss of internal differentiation of the clusters , the removal of the structural features encoded in the corresponding weaker eigenvectors . on the other hand",
    ", the differentiation of clusters from each other via the dominant eigenvectors will be the clearer the larger the remaining eigenvalues are , especially @xmath72 .",
    "this provides a criterion for selecting the number of clusters @xmath65 : the clustering will be the better the larger @xmath73 is .",
    "equivalently , we select @xmath65 based on the _ timescale separation factor _",
    "@xmath74 which is independent of the particular choice of @xmath75 , and invariant under rescaling of the time axis .",
    "this criterion gives a ranking of the different possible choices ( from 1 to @xmath76 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath77 and therefore @xmath78 implies a limitation of this approach , since the choice @xmath79 is always characterized as absolutely optimal .",
    "therefore the first meaningful  and usually best  choice is the second entry in the @xmath65 ranking list .    to determine which elements belong to the same cluster , we need a measure @xmath80 of the dissimilarity of cluster signatures , that is , of the column vectors of @xmath44 . since these vectors belong to the space of right eigenvectors of @xmath3 , the appropriate dissimilarity metric is based on the norm corresponding to the normalization equation for right eigenvectors [ eq.([ne ] ) left ] : @xmath81 the resulting column vector dissimilarity @xmath82 has the convenient property that the dimensionality of the space within which the clustering has to be performed can be reduced , because the expression obtained by inserting the spectral representation for the matrix entries of @xmath44 , @xmath83 simplifies to @xmath84 using the generalized orthonormality of right eigenvectors , eq.([go ] ) . since for",
    "appropriately chosen @xmath85 contributions for larger @xmath86 vanish starting from @xmath87 , and because @xmath58 for all @xmath11 , it is sufficient to let the sum run over the range @xmath88 .",
    "the dissimilarity @xmath80 can therefore be interpreted as the euclidean distance within a @xmath89-dimensional left _",
    "eigenvector space _ , where each element @xmath12 is associated with a position vector @xmath90    to actually perform the clustering , we can in principle use any algorithm that is designed to minimize the sum of within - cluster variances .",
    "our implementation derives from the observation that clusters in eigenvector space form a @xmath65-simplex @xcite . a first rough estimate of the cluster locations",
    "can therefore be obtained by searching for the extreme points of the data cloud , employing a subalgorithm described in ref.@xcite : determine the point farthest from the center of the cloud , then the point farthest from the first one ; then iteratively the point farthest from the hyperplane spanned by all the previously identified points , until @xmath65 points are found . using the result of this procedure as initialization , the standard k - means algorithm @xcite that normally tends to get stuck in local minima converges in almost all cases quickly onto the correct solution .",
    "in summary , the algorithmic steps of the eigenvector space method introduced in this paper are : ( 1 )  calculate the matrix of bivariate synchronization indices @xmath32 , eq.([rbar ] ) .",
    "( 2 )  convert the synchronization matrix @xmath0 into a transition matrix @xmath3 , eq.([tm ] ) .",
    "( 3 )  compute the eigenvalues @xmath45 and left eigenvectors @xmath48 of @xmath3 .",
    "( 4 )  select the number of clusters @xmath65 , @xmath91 , with the largest timescale separation factor @xmath92 , eq.([tsf ] ) .",
    "( 5 )  determine the positions @xmath93 , eq.([es ] ) , in eigenvector space for @xmath85 , eq.([ts ] ) .",
    "( 6 )  search for @xmath65 extreme points of the data cloud .",
    "( 7 )  use these as initialization for k - means clustering .      , timescales @xmath94 , and timescale separation factors @xmath92 .",
    "the maximal separation factor @xmath95 indicates the presence of four clusters .",
    "( c )  positions attributed to oscillators in 3-dimensional eigenvector space @xmath96 .",
    "the clustering by the k - means algorithm results in a cluster composed of oscillators # 14 ( @xmath97 ) , two single - element clusters consisting in oscillators # 5 ( @xmath98 ) and # 6 ( @xmath99 ) , respectively , and a cluster composed of oscillators # 79 ( @xmath100 ) . ]    in order to illustrate the operation of the method , we apply it to multivariate time series data obtained from simulated nonlinear oscillators , coupled in such a way as to be able to observe synchronization clusters of different size as well as unsynchronized elements .",
    "the system consists of @xmath101 lorenz oscillators that are coupled diffusively via their @xmath102-components : @xmath103 the coupling coefficients @xmath104 were chosen from @xmath105 to implement the coupling configuration depicted in fig.[ex](a ) , such that oscillators # 24 are unidirectionally driven by # 1 , oscillators # 7 and 8 driven by # 9 , and # 5 and 6 are uncoupled .",
    "these differential equations were numerically integrated using a step size of @xmath106 , starting from randomly chosen initial conditions . after discarding an initial transient of @xmath107 data points , further @xmath108 samples entered data processing .",
    "instantaneous phases @xmath109 of oscillators @xmath12 at time points @xmath110 were determined from the @xmath102-components using the analytic signal approach after removal of the temporal mean , and bivariate synchronization strengths @xmath32 were computed .",
    "the outcomes of the eigenvector space method applied to the resultant matrix of bivariate indices are presented in fig.[ex ] .",
    "figure  [ ex](b ) shows the spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath45 of the transition matrix @xmath3 with the corresponding timescales @xmath94 and timescale separation factors @xmath92 .",
    "a gap in the eigenvalue spectrum between indices @xmath111 and @xmath112 translates into a maximum timescale separation factor for @xmath113 , which recommends a search for four clusters in the eigenvector space for timescale @xmath114 .",
    "this 3-dimensional space is depicted in fig.[ex](c ) , where the expected grouping into four clusters can be clearly recognized in the arrangement of elements @xmath12 with positions @xmath93 .",
    "these four clusters that correspond to the two groups of driven oscillators and the two uncoupled oscillators ( each of which forms a single - element cluster ) are easily identified by the k - means algorithm .",
    "the results shown here were obtained using @xmath69 ; alternative choices of @xmath115 and @xmath116 yielded the same clustering .",
    "to assess the performance of the eigenvector space method introduced in this paper , we compare it with the previous approach to synchronization cluster analysis based on spectral decomposition .",
    "for reference , we briefly recollect the important details .",
    "the participation index method @xcite is based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the symmetric synchronization matrix @xmath0 itself , into eigenvalues @xmath117 and @xmath118-normalized eigenvectors @xmath119 .",
    "each of the eigenvectors that belong to an eigenvalue @xmath120 is identified with a cluster , and a system element @xmath12 is attributed to that cluster @xmath86 in which it participates most strongly , as determined via the participation index @xmath121 where @xmath122 are the eigenvector components of @xmath119 .",
    "the method performs quite well in many configurations , but it encounters problems when confronted with clusters of similar strength that are slightly synchronized to each other , which was demonstrated in ref.@xcite using a simulation",
    ".     elements , divided into two clusters containing @xmath123 and @xmath124 elements , respectively .",
    "the inter - cluster synchronization strength @xmath125 is varied from @xmath62 up to the value of intra - cluster synchronization @xmath126 .",
    "synchronization matrices are generated based on samples of size @xmath127 .",
    "the quantity shown is the relative frequency ( over 100 trials ) with which the respective algorithm failed to recover exactly the given two - cluster structure ; it is visualized in gray scale , covering the range from 0 ( white ) to 1 ( black ) .",
    "comparison shows that in a large area along @xmath128 where the participation index method fails , the eigenvector space method introduced in this paper performs perfectly . ]    here we employ a refined version of that simulation to compare the two methods .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath129 oscillators forming two clusters , and check whether the methods are able to detect this structure from the bivariate synchronization matrix @xmath0 for different degrees of inter - cluster synchrony @xmath125 .",
    "the cluster sizes are controlled via a parameter @xmath123 , such that the first cluster comprises elements @xmath130 , the second @xmath131 .    to be able to time - efficiently perform a large number of simulation runs and to have precise control over the structure of the generated synchronization matrices ,",
    "we do not implement the system via a set of differential equations . instead ,",
