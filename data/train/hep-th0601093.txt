    "recent astronomical observations indicate that our universe is currently undergoing an epoch of accelerated expansion @xcite . following the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology",
    "such an expansion implies the existence of a dark energy ( de ) component to the mass - energy density of the universe . at present",
    "it is fair to say that disclosing the nature of de is one of the central problems in the research of both cosmology and theoretical physics ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) . in this direction",
    "we are faced with many fundamental and difficult issues , among of which the following two open questions are of particular importance .",
    "the first one is on the nature and dynamical properties of the dark energy .",
    "currently it is not clear yet whether de can be described by cosmological constant which is independent of time , or by dynamical fields such as quintessence , k - essence , tachyon fields or phantom fields . the second is the coincidence problem , dubbed as  why are the densities of matter and dark energy of precisely the same order today ? \" @xcite .    to shed light on these two open questions ,",
    "some interesting de models were proposed recently .",
    "those models can be divided into two categories , i.e. the holographic dark energy ( hde ) models and the interacting de models .",
    "the former stems from the holographic hypothesis @xcite and can provide an intriguing way to interpret the dynamics of de , while it is suggested that the latter can help to understand the coincidence problem by considering the possible interaction between dark energy and cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "let us first start with a close look on the holographic dark energy model motivated from the holographic hypothesis , which has gradually been believed to be a fundamental principle in the quantum theory of gravity . according to this principle ,",
    "the number of degrees of freedom for a system within a finite region should be finite and is bounded roughly by the area of its boundary . while in a cosmological setting the challenge is to put a reasonable and well - defined upper bound on the entropy of the universe .",
    "motivated by bekenstein entropy bound , it seems plausible to require that for an effective quantum field theory in a box of size @xmath0 with uv cutoff @xmath1 , the total entropy should satisfy the relation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the entropy of a black hole with the same size @xmath0 . but",
    "further consideration indicates that to saturate this inequality some states with schwarzschild radius much larger than the box size have to be counted in . as a result a stronger",
    "entropy bound has been proposed in @xcite , requiring that the total energy of system with size @xmath0 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same radius , namely @xmath4 while saturating this inequality by choosing the largest @xmath0 it gives rise to a holographic energy density @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "then the key issue is what possible physical scale one can choose as the cutoff @xmath0 constrained by the fact of the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "originally the natural choice is to identify the hubble horizon as @xmath0 , however , as pointed out in @xcite , this will lead to a wrong equation of state for dark matter which conflicts with the ordinary one in standard cosmology . as a result , in @xcite li proposed to take the future event horizon as the largest size @xmath0 , which gives rise to desired results and then stimulate a lot of interests and discussions in this subject@xcite . however , there are some unsatisfactory points in this conjecture .",
    "first , it still remains puzzling how the current evolution of dark energy density can be determined by the _ future _ event horizon .",
    "second , the coincidence problem can hardly be solved in this context .    as pointed out in @xcite , the reason that one is forced to take the future event horizon is based on the assumption that the energy densities of dark energy and dark matter evolve independently . however , if there exists interaction between de and dark matter ( dm ) , then the cutoff @xmath0 is not necessarily identified as the future event horizon . as a matter of fact , the interaction between de and dm is proposed to solve the coincidence problem and has been discussed in many recent works @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished by introducing the coupling terms in the equations of state for matter and dark energy densities , which can bring the ratio of these two ingredients into a constant at late times . from the theoretical point of view",
    "this sort of coupling is completely possible due to the unknown nature of dm and de .",
    "in addition , this proposal is compatible with the current observations such as the snia and wmap data@xcite , and even favored in some circumstances as suggested in @xcite . but",
    "until now , only certain special interacting terms have been considered in existing literatures .",
    "now based on the above discussion , it is natural to ask if we could combine these two theoretical proposals together so as to improve our understanding of dark energy .",
    "this is the main purpose of our paper .",
    "although there are many existing works in both two directions , most discussions in those works only considered specific characteristic sizes or interacting terms .",
    "for instance , the characteristic size is usually assumed to be the future event horizon after the work @xcite and the interaction term is assumed to take a form as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a coupling constant . however , there is no strong theoretical motivations for these choices . in this paper , rather than fixing either the interacting term or the holographic characteristic size ,",
    "we intend to investigate the nature of interacting and holographic de and the coincidence problem in a more general formalism .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present brief reviews on interacting dark energy and holographic dark energy in section 2 and section 3 , respectively .",
    "in particular , given the conditions that our universe is currently accelerating and the ratio of dark matter density to dark energy density deceases , we derive general constraints on the relations among the interacting term , holographic size and the equation of state parameter of dark energy @xmath9 . then we turn to the coincidence problem in section 4 , under the simplest requirement that the ratio of dark matter to dark energy density to be constant . in section 5",
    "we consider the case that the ratio can vary with time slowly and demonstrate how the coincidence problem can be alleviated through some specific examples by providing appropriate interacting terms and holographic sizes .",
    "we start with the standard friedmann equations in which de and dmare assumed to be independent and there is no interaction between them . provided our current universe",
    "is dominated by dark energy with the state equations @xmath10 and cold dark matter with @xmath11 , these equations read as @xmath12@xmath13,\\label{f2}\\]]@xmath14,\\label{f3}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the hubble factor .",
    "it is well known that equations ( [ f1])-([f3 ] ) are not independent and any one of them can be derived from the other two .",
    "introduce @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the first friedmann can also be written as @xmath18 .",
    "now we proceed to interacting dark energy models in which dark matter and dark energy are postulated to be coupled such that dark energy can decay into cold dark matter . as a result",
    ", the last equation can be written as the combination of following two evolving equations , @xmath19@xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the interacting term . to be a realistic model",
    ", the interacting de model should satisfy the observational constraints .",
    "first , we consider the constraint on @xmath21 by the observation that our universe is currently accelerating . since the ratio of dark matter to dark energy plays a special role and its dynamics is a major subject of this paper , for convenience we denote the ratio @xmath22 by @xmath23 which is related to @xmath24 by @xmath25 .",
    "then from ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) we have @xmath26 noticed that equation ( [ f4 ] ) always holds no matter whether the interaction is taken into account or not .",
    "the solution to this equation can be formally written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 . as a result",
    ", the requirement @xmath29 leads to @xmath30 on the other hand , from ( [ i1 ] ) and ( [ i2 ] ) we find that the interacting term has the following general form , @xmath31 where @xmath32 can be absorbed by redefining @xmath33 such that @xmath34 then from ( [ h2 ] ) one finds that @xmath35    furthermore , it is expected that the ratio of dark matter density to dark energy density decreases with the evolution of the universe , namely , @xmath36 .",
    "this requirement together with the previous one ( [ h2 ] ) implies that the interacting term should satisfy the following constraint @xmath37",
    "now we turn to the holographic dark energy ( hde ) models .",
    "as introduced in section 1 , in this context the dark energy density is assumed to be saturated in the region with size @xmath0 , @xmath38 comparing this bound with the first friedmann equation we easily obtain a relation between the characteristic size @xmath0 and the hubble factor @xmath32 as @xmath39    in general the characteristic size @xmath0 need be chosen in such a way that the dark energy can be responsible for the acceleration of the universe . furthermore , such choice should not conflict with the state equations of dark energy and dark matter . as a result , when there is no interaction between de  and dm , i.e. @xmath40 , @xmath0 is conventionally taken as the future event horizon @xcite so as to fit the observational data .",
    "however , as explained in section 5 , the coincidence problem is hardly solved by pure hde alone .",
    "therefore , in the following discussion on hde models , we will consider the case with non - vanishing @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , instead of fixing @xmath0 or the interacting term @xmath41 at the beginning , we will take a more phenomenological view and consider them to be free dynamical quantities but constrained by observations .",
    "now , as in the previous section , from the requirements of accelerating universe and decreasing ratio of dm density to de density one can derive the constraints on those quantities . taking the derivative with respect to time on both sides of equation ( [ c1 ] ) and using ( [ i30 ] ) lead to a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath41 as @xmath42 now due to the constraint ( [ i4 ] ) we find the size @xmath0 should satisfy @xmath43 thus we find in a general formalism of interacting holographic dark energy , the interacting term and the characteristic size of holographic bound are constrained by the inequalities ( [ i4 ] ) and ( [ h4 ] ) , respectively .    alternatively from ( [ i30 ] ) and ( [ qo ] ) we may have a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 as @xmath44 thus @xmath36 leads to @xmath45    furthermore replacing the parameter @xmath9 appearing in ( [ i4 ] ) by @xmath0 we may find the following inequality @xmath46    in summary , we find for interacting holographic dark energy models , @xmath0 , @xmath41 , @xmath9 and @xmath23 are not independent quantities but related by equations ( [ qo ] ) and ( [ lo ] ) , or ( [ i30 ] ) and ( [ lo ] ) since among these three equations only two of them are independent . thus given any two of them then the dyanamics of the other two can be determined . for instance ,",
    "if we specify the interaction term @xmath41 and the characteristic size @xmath0 , then the dynamics of @xmath9 and @xmath23 may be determined and vice versa .",
    "however if only one of them is specified , then the dynamics of the other three can not be uniquely fixed .",
    "for example , in an interacting hde model with the future event horizon as the characteristic scale @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath47 which gives rise to a relation @xmath48 .",
    "then from ( [ lo ] ) it is easy to derive the following relation @xmath49 in this case @xmath36 requires that @xmath50 if we further specify the interaction term , e.g. @xmath51 as in references@xcite , then the dynamics of @xmath9 and @xmath23 can be determined uniquely , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , since our goal is to investigate the coincidence problem , we intend to put constraints on the evolution of @xmath23 and then explore what expressions the other quantities including @xmath0,@xmath41 and @xmath9 may take .",
    "this is what we are going to do in next two sections .",
    "before proceed , we first demonstrate how the coincidence problem arises in the standard cosmology . setting @xmath52 in ( [ i1 ] ) and ( [ i2 ] ) will lead to @xmath53 ( see also ( [ i30 ] ) ) . now from ( [ h2 ] ) one finds that@xmath54 which means during acceleration @xmath23 decreases faster than @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , from friedmann equations , one finds that @xmath56 and@xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are @xmath60 constants which can be related to the current values of @xmath24 .",
    "then it is easy to see when @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath23 decreases quadratically as expected for a matter dominated universe and when @xmath63 , @xmath23 deceases exponentially as expected in a dark energy dominated universe .",
    "then it is only when @xmath64 is around @xmath65 that @xmath66 .",
    "it is expected that adding interaction may change the dynamics of @xmath23 greatly . in this section",
    "we consider the simplest possibility with @xmath67 , which implies @xmath68 .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that this situation only occurs at late times .",
    "suppose the ratio @xmath23 is a constant , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "we immediately obtain the following equations @xmath70@xmath71 in addition , the hubble factor is inversely proportional to characteristic size @xmath0 as @xmath72 . therefore specifying any one of quantities @xmath73 ,",
    "the dynamics of the other two can be uniquely determined from above equations .",
    "we classify some possibilities in the following subsections .",
    "one possible choice for the interaction term is setting @xmath74 as in previous references , where @xmath8 is a constant .",
    "then from ( [ i4c ] ) we find that @xmath9 is fixed as @xmath75 consequently the solutions to @xmath32 and @xmath0 can be obtained from ( [ f5c ] ) as @xmath76 in addition , from ( [ i4 ] ) one finds that @xmath77 therefore , it is obvious that in non - interacting models ( i.e. @xmath78 ) @xmath79 and @xmath29 can not be achieved simultaneously .",
    "this can be considered as an important hint for the need of interacting dark energy .",
    "as shown in the previous section , specifying the holographic characteristic size will determine @xmath41 and @xmath9 since @xmath23 has already been fixed to be @xmath80 .",
    "here we consider the hde  model with @xmath0 being the future event horizon . from ( [ i4c ] ) and ( [ f5c ] ) we find correspondingly that the parameter @xmath9 and @xmath41 have to be constants as well .",
    "@xmath81 @xmath82    using the current data @xmath83 , @xmath84 and setting @xmath85 , we find @xmath86 which is a phantom - preferred model . from ( [ f4 ] )",
    "we find that @xmath87 while @xmath88      if both @xmath0 and @xmath41 are specified as previous subsections , then from ( [ j5 ] ) and ( [ jj5 ] ) it is easy to see @xmath67 can be reached only when the constant @xmath89 takes the value as @xmath90",
    "the above discussion shows that the interaction between de and dmcan lead to a constant @xmath23 .",
    "although it is not clear how to obtain a @xmath23 of @xmath60 size at early times , this simple strategy can be used to account for particular situations ( e.g. late time evolution of the universe ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is no strong motivation for setting @xmath23 to be a constant .",
    "it is worthwhile to explore some more realistic models in which @xmath23 varies slowly with time .",
    "we discuss this possibility in detail here .    advocated by the above discussion",
    ", one expects that certain amount of interaction can alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "one possibility which has been proposed in @xcite is to allow the ratio of two energy densities to vary slowly but require that there are two positive solutions @xmath91 to @xmath67 .",
    "then the coincidence can be alleviated if @xmath92 is close to @xmath60 as the ratio @xmath23 evolves from the unstable but finite maximum @xmath93 to a stable minimum @xmath94 at late time , instead of from @xmath95 to 0 . to demonstrate this possibility we consider again the model with an interaction term @xmath51 and a constant @xmath9 . from equation ( [ i30 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath96 obviously setting @xmath97 the equation has two positive solutions with a relation @xmath98 .",
    "it is also possible to show that the ratio will run from an unstable but finite maximum @xmath99 to a stable minimum @xmath92 at late time@xcite .",
    "however , this does not occur in the context of pure holographic dark energy if one chooses the future event horizon as the characteristic size @xmath0 . in the absence of interaction ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath23 is described by @xmath100 defining @xmath101 @xmath102 leads to @xmath103 there is only one positive solution to @xmath97 with @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "thus , as in standard cosmology @xmath23 runs from infinity to zero and consequently the coincidence problem still exits in this setting .",
    "next we intend to propose an alternative way to alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "that is , it might not be necessary to have both an unstable finite maximum and a stable minimum close to @xmath60 .",
    "the later is more important in the coincidence problem and presumably is determined by the physics effective at the current evolution of the universe .",
    "the former is more related to the early evolution of the universe and whether or not an @xmath60 initial condition can be obtained is determined by physics beyond the scope of this work .",
    "therefore , we would rather leave the question concerning the existence of a positive maximum open and concentrate on the models with a positive stable minimum at late time .",
    "in particular , if we find this stable value is not quite far from the current observation then the coincidence problem may be alleviated as the universe has a long time to stay at this stage with a similar ratio .",
    "now as an example consider adding the interaction term @xmath51 into the holographic dark energy model presented above .",
    "now we find equation ( [ hy ] ) is changed to @xmath106 provided @xmath107 and @xmath108 , it still has only one positive solution to @xmath109 but _ not _ at @xmath105 .",
    "the exact position of the minimum depends on the values of @xmath6 and @xmath8 . for explicitness",
    "we illustrate the evolution of @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with @xmath85 and @xmath110 , which is described by the dot - dashed curve .",
    "moreover , in the discussion of ( [ r1 ] ) from which two positive solutions are obtained for @xmath97 , we have made two assumptions , i.e. the coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath9 are constants .",
    "a time dependent @xmath89 or@xmath111 might change this situation .",
    "in addition , as mentioned in section 3 , specifying any two of @xmath0 ( or @xmath112 ) , @xmath41 , @xmath9 and @xmath23 will determine the other two uniquely .",
    "in principle , @xmath9 might be different from those assumed in the discussion of ( [ r1 ] ) and consequently will lead to different results .",
    "below we will discuss this in more detail through the following models .",
    "in this model we assume that@xmath113 i.e. @xmath114 where @xmath115constant .",
    "the interaction given by ( [ r2 ] ) decreases exponentially as @xmath23 increases and consequently at early times when @xmath116 , @xmath41 is very small and thus can be ignored .",
    "therefore , in this model the early age of the universe can be described by the standard friedmann equations without interaction .",
    "the interaction becomes important only at late time and will lead to a stable minimum which can mitigate the coincidence problem . as ( [ i30 ] ) , one finds that in this case @xmath117 and subsequently from ( [ qo ] ) one have @xmath118\\label{rr3}.\\ ] ] now to obtain more explicit results we have two options .",
    "one is to set @xmath9 to be a constant , for example @xmath119 .",
    "this is completely possible in the presence of holographic dark energy and the corresponding size of holographic bound is determined by @xmath120 with this choice the equation ( [ r3])has only one solution to @xmath97 for small @xmath121 . for example , when @xmath122,@xmath123 , the solution to @xmath97 is @xmath124 the second option , instead of specifying @xmath9 , is setting an appropriate characteristic size @xmath0 which can also lead to the same results obtained above . to show this",
    ", we consider the hde model with @xmath0 being the future horizon . from ( [ rr3 ] )",
    "one has @xmath125 which lead to @xmath126 for @xmath122 , @xmath127 and @xmath85 , the solution to @xmath97 is @xmath128 .",
    "in addition , one can check that for @xmath129 one always has @xmath130 .",
    "in addition , in this case @xmath9 also can across @xmath131 as in many de  models .",
    "for instance , for @xmath132 , @xmath85 and @xmath133 , @xmath134 , one finds that @xmath9 across @xmath131 at @xmath135 .",
    "[ ptb ]    in this subsection we will consider the situation where the dynamics of @xmath23 at late time can be approximated by a power law dependence on @xmath137 , i.e. @xmath138under the assumption that @xmath139 where @xmath140 @xmath141 and @xmath142 is a constant . as in section 3 ,",
    "now one can solve for @xmath9 and @xmath112 . from ( [ i1 ] ) and ( [ i2 ] ) it is easy to find that @xmath143 then from ( [ r1 ] ) , one finds that the only solution to @xmath97 is @xmath144 .",
    "note that this result does not dependent on the choice of @xmath145 , as what can be obtained from ( [ r6 ] ) directly .",
    "the de density is found to be@xmath146 then from ( [ f4a ] ) one finds that@xmath147    from ( [ h2 ] ) one finds that the condition @xmath29 requires that@xmath148 as an example , @xmath149 leads to @xmath150 . to compare the predictions of this model with low redshift observations , the distance moduli vs. redshift",
    "are plotted in fig.[fig1 ] .    as shown in section 3 , given @xmath41 and @xmath23 , the characteristic size @xmath0 and the dynamics of @xmath9 can be determined uniquely .",
    "in fact , from ( [ r8 ] ) one finds immediately that in hde models @xmath151 moreover , from another point of view , ( [ r6 ] ) and ( [ r7 ] ) can also be considered as the consequences of the characteristic size given by ( [ r9 ] ) .",
    "similar to the previous subsection , here we consider the situation where the late time evolution of @xmath23 to @xmath152 can be approximated by an exponential function of @xmath137 , i.e. @xmath153 where both @xmath59 and @xmath154 are constants . for simplicity , in the following discussion we set @xmath155 and thus we have@xmath156 which leads to @xmath157 .",
    "nevertheless , rather than fixing the interaction term @xmath41 , we consider in this subsection the hde model with the characteristic size @xmath0 being the future event horizon . as discussed in section 3 , from ( [ i30 ] ) and ( [ h1 ] ) , the interaction @xmath41 and @xmath9 are found to be@xmath158    [ ptb ]    from ( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ h5 ] ) one finds that @xmath29 and @xmath36 require that @xmath159 then from ( [ r10 ] ) one has @xmath160 since @xmath161 , @xmath162 it is easy to check that the above requirement can be satisfied for any @xmath59 if @xmath163 .",
    "again we can compare the predictions of this model with low redshift observations , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "moreover , to compare the above three models and the interacting hde model discussed at the beginning of this section ( see ( [ r1a ] ) ) , the dynamics of @xmath23 in these models are plotted in fig.[fig3 ] in which the dotted curve corresponds to model 1 , the dashed curve to model 2 , the solid curve to model 3 and the dot - dashed curve to ( [ r1a ] ) .",
    "the parameters used for model 2 and 3 are the same as those for fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig3 ] . for model 1 ,",
    "the parameters are given in the sentence following ( [ r3 ] ) .",
    "for the curve corresponding to ( [ r1a ] ) , @xmath6 and @xmath89 in ( [ r1a ] ) are taken to be @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "we have presented a general formalism of interacting and holographic dark energy in this paper .",
    "let us summarize the main results as follows .",
    "first we pointed out that in this general formalism both the characteristic size of holographic bound @xmath0 and the coupling term of interaction @xmath21 for dark energy are not necessarily fixed as in previous references where these two sorts of models are separately investigated .",
    "given the conditions that our universe is currently accelerating and the ratio of dark matter to dark energy decreases , we derived the general relations among the quantities of @xmath0,@xmath21,@xmath9 and @xmath23 as well as the constraints on the possible range of these quantities .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of parameters @xmath9 and @xmath23 are determined by the choice of @xmath0 and @xmath21 , thus providing a mechanism to change the evolution of @xmath23 from that in standard cosmology such that the coincidence problem may be solved .",
    "this is the main feature of our formalism .",
    "then we proposed three kinds of strategies to show how the coincidence problem can be alleviated in this context .",
    "one possibility is to have a constant ratio throughout the evolution of the universe .",
    "the second is to have two constant solutions to the ratio @xmath23 such that it will run from the maximum constant to the minimum stable one , while the third and perhaps the most practical one is to have stable constant solution at the late time but this value is not quite far from our current observation .",
    "focusing on the third strategy we constructed some models explicitly and show how this can be implemented by appropriately choosing the quantities of @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
    "in particular our results show that at least in the low red - shift region these models are well fitted with the current observation .    in all this paper",
    "we assume our universe is spatially flat but it is completely possible to show that the parallel analysis could be extended to the spatially closed and hyperbolic universe .",
    "we also expect that the further investigation will provide us a more exact picture of the dark matter and dark energy by strictly fitting the observations in high red - shift region .",

    "<S> the interacting and holographic dark energy models involve two important quantities . </S>",
    "<S> one is the characteristic size of the holographic bound and the other is the coupling term of the interaction between dark energy and dark matter . rather than fixing either of them , we present a detailed study of theoretical relationships among these quantities and cosmological parameters as well as observational constraints in a general formalism . in particular , we argue that the ratio of dark matter to dark energy density depends on the choice of these two quantities , thus providing a mechanism to change the evolution history of the ratio from that in standard cosmology such that the coincidence problem may be solved . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this problem in detail and construct explicit models to demonstrate that it may be alleviated provided that the interacting term and the characteristic size of holographic bound are appropriately specified . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these models are well fitted with the current observation at least in the low red - shift region . </S>"
