    "<S> conversely , an entangling quantum logic gate for a pair of spin qubits in silicon is still awaiting experimental demonstration . </S>",
    "<S> several coupling mechanisms can be used for this purpose , including magnets  @xcite and microwave photons  @xcite , but the simplest is the exchange interaction @xmath4 , arising from the overlap of electron wavefunctions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> exchange interaction between pairs of donors in silicon has been observed in bulk spin resonance experiments  @xcite and , very recently , by electron transport experiments through a donor molecule  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , relevant applications to quantum information processing require the ability to measure the instantaneous quantum state of the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> here we report the observation of large exchange coupling @xmath0  @xmath1ev between the electrons of a @xmath2p donor pair . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the @xmath2p pair is integrated within a top - gated silicon single - electron transistor ( set )  @xcite to perform single - shot readout of the spin singlet ( @xmath5 ) and triplet ( @xmath6 ) states of the two - electron system . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a natural silicon substrate implanted with phosphorus ions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the donor electrons are tunnel - coupled to the island of a top - gated set  @xcite ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electrochemical potential of the donor electrons @xmath12 can be varied using a donor gate ( dg ) above the implant window .    with the dg voltage ( @xmath13 ) set near a donor charge transition </S>",
    "<S> , the device is tuned so the set current switches between @xmath14 ( coulomb - blockade ) and @xmath15 when the system is neutral or ionized , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we use a 3-level single - shot spin readout sequence  @xcite ( a ) consisting of load , read and empty phases . during the read - phase , we measure @xmath16 while varying @xmath13 such that the @xmath12 goes from higher to lower than @xmath17 . a well - defined `` tail '' ( a ) where excess current occurs at the start of the read - phase indicates the presence of an energy - split pair of electron states . </S>",
    "<S> the high - energy electron tunnels out of the donor ( @xmath15 ) shortly after the start of the read - phase , and is replaced by one in the low energy state ( @xmath14 again ) thereafter . </S>",
    "<S> the data in was taken in the absence of magnetic field ( @xmath18  t ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the observed splitting can not be the zeeman energy @xmath19 ( @xmath20  ghz / t is the electron gyromagnetic ratio ) of a single spin  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we postulate that the measurement in a constitutes the observation of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states of a pair of @xmath2p donors , split by an exchange interaction @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the @xmath8 and @xmath7 electrochemical potentials at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> to extract the value of @xmath4 we first convert @xmath13 to a shift in @xmath1 , by fitting a fermi distribution function to the shape of @xmath24 for @xmath25  v in the read - phase after the decay of the `` tail '' , and using the value @xmath26  mk ( measured separately ) to calibrate the energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> then , the length of the readout `` tail '' @xmath27  v can be converted into the value of @xmath28  @xmath1ev . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath4 is expected to correspond to donors @xmath29  nm apart  @xcite .    , used to estimate the exchange coupling @xmath4 , at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line identifies the appropriate read - phase voltage for tunnel - rate selective ( tr - ro ) readout . </S>",
    "<S> * b. * diagrams of the electrochemical potentials @xmath30 relative to the set fermi energy @xmath17 with examples of readout traces identifying each of the states . due to the valley configuration of the set island </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : readout ] ]    tuning the device to the region indicated by the dashed line in a , the single - shot readout traces reveal two distinct tunnel - out processes ( shown in c ) : a slow process with a tunnel time @xmath32  ms , and a faster process for which the tunnel time is shorter than the rise - time @xmath33  @xmath1s of the amplifier ( see b for sample traces ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of two very distinct tunnel rates reinforces the interpretation that we are observing the spin states of a @xmath4-coupled donor pair . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 state must correspond to an excited 2-electron orbital , with a more extended wavefunction  @xcite that results in stronger tunnel coupling to the nearby set island .    </S>",
    "<S> the \\{1s } orbital of a single @xmath2p donor in si has a valley - orbit ground state @xmath34 ( 1-fold degenerate ) , and excited states @xmath35 ( 3-fold degenerate ) and @xmath36 ( 2-fold degenerate )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the 3-fold degeneracy of @xmath35 arises from it being an antisymmetric combination of pairs of valleys @xmath37 , where all valleys have the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34 to @xmath35 splitting is @xmath38  mev , making the excited valley - orbit states unimportant for most aspects of single - qubit physics . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a donor pair with strong exchange interaction , the hybridization of the valley - orbit states results in `` bonding '' / `` antibonding '' eigenstates , whose energy is split according to the wavefunction overlap . </S>",
    "<S> the bohr radius of the @xmath35 states is about twice that of @xmath34 , resulting in a much larger splitting of the coupled states . </S>",
    "<S> it has been estimated  @xcite that for interdonor separation @xmath11  nm there is an inversion in the hierarchy of states that originate from single - donor @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the bonding combination of @xmath35 states ( @xmath39 ) crosses below that of the antibonding @xmath34 ( @xmath40 ) , whereas the overall ground state always remains the bonding @xmath34 combination ( @xmath41 ) ( see b ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this configuration the spin - singlet state occupies the @xmath41 valley - orbit eigenstate , while the spin - triplets can occupy any of the three @xmath42 states , distinguished by their valley composition . </S>",
    "<S> we denote all the available triplet states as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 stands for the slater determinant .    </S>",
    "<S> two crucial aspects of the physics of donors and dots in silicon need to be considered here . </S>",
    "<S> first , the 2-electron @xmath42 states are not degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> consider for example a donor pair oriented along @xmath10 , as in a. since the transverse effective mass in si is smaller than the longitudinal one @xcite , states composed of valleys perpendicular to the orientation of the pair have stronger tunnel coupling , hence @xmath45 are lowered in energy further than the @xmath31 state ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath41 is not an equal - weight combination of all 6 valleys , but has a predominant component of valleys perpendicular to the dimer axis . </S>",
    "<S> second , the spin state of the donor pair is read out through electron tunneling into the island of an set formed at a [ 001 ] interface , where the electron states consist exclusively of @xmath46 valleys . as a consequence , the set island only couples to states of the donor dimer with nonzero @xmath46 valley composition . </S>",
    "<S> both these si - specific aspects are revealed in the time - resolved experiments described below .    </S>",
    "<S> single - shot tr - ro  @xcite is performed by setting a time threshold @xmath47 , a maximum readout wait time @xmath48  ms , and declaring that ( i ) a tunnel - out event detected at @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath50 , ( ii ) @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath7 , and ( iii ) no tunnel event within @xmath52 corresponds to @xmath53 states that do not couple to the set . </S>",
    "<S> a statistical analysis  @xcite of the histograms in c using these thresholds reveals a tr - ro readout fidelity @xmath54% for @xmath50@xmath7 discrimination and @xmath55% for @xmath7@xmath53 discrimination .    </S>",
    "<S> this readout technique allows us to follow in real time the evolution of the state populations , as they relax from the initially loaded state to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by taking repeated readout traces as a function of the duration @xmath56 of the load phase , and calculating the readout proportion of @xmath50 ( dots in figures [ fig : b0 ] and [ fig : bn0 ] ) or @xmath7 ( squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this measurement at @xmath18 is plotted in . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of the @xmath7 and @xmath50 detection probabilities as a function of load time @xmath56 is not constant , but exhibits a dip for @xmath57  ms . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by assuming we have a donor dimer oriented ( predominantly ) along @xmath10 , such that the @xmath53 are below @xmath50 in energy , acting as `` shelving '' states in the relaxation process . </S>",
    "<S> we model the data with the rate equations below , where we include for simplicity only the @xmath58 shelving state : @xmath59    here @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 are the populations of the corresponding states , @xmath63 is the relaxation rate from @xmath50 to @xmath58 and @xmath64 is the @xmath65 to @xmath7 relaxation rate . </S>",
    "<S> we include the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 $ ] ) that multiply the corresponding populations to account for initialization and measurement imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> a least - squares fit to the data in b yields @xmath69  ms , @xmath70  ms , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the model also yields @xmath73 ( an accurate value of @xmath74 could not be extracted ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is again consistent with having a dimer along @xmath10 , for which it is predicted that  in the high-@xmath4 regime  the valley composition of the ground state @xmath41 will have five times less contribution from the valleys which are longitudinal to the dimer orientation  @xcite . finally , the near - unity value of @xmath75 confirms that the system is preferentially initialized in @xmath50 , as expected on the basis of the spatial extent of @xmath31 states , and the valley selection rules discussed above .    . </S>",
    "<S> dots : fraction of fast tunneling events identified as @xmath50 according to the tr - ro threshold . squares : slow tunneling events , identified as @xmath7 , excluding those with no observed tunneling in the read - phase ( @xmath58 ) . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines are fits to the model in . </S>",
    "<S> the triangles correspond to @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : b0 ] ]    in this picture , @xmath63 represents a valley relaxation rate , while the spin relaxation process is captured by @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath78  ms extracted from the data agrees well with the @xmath79 relaxation times predicted by borhani and hu  @xcite specifically for @xmath2p donor pairs in si , in the presence of an exchange interaction @xmath0  @xmath1ev . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - nuclear hyperfine coupling @xmath80 ( here @xmath81 ) mixes the @xmath4-split @xmath82 states and provides a new channel for spin - lattice relaxation which is @xmath83  orders of magnitude faster than a single - spin flip at an equivalent value of the zeeman splitting ( @xmath84  @xmath1ev corresponds to @xmath85  t on a single spin , where @xmath86  s  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath79 relaxation is predicted to slow down at lower @xmath4 , giving @xmath87  s for @xmath88  @xmath1ev . for @xmath89  mhz  @xmath90  @xmath1ev </S>",
    "<S> this relaxation channel becomes suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore our measurements clearly indicate that 2-qubit coupling schemes which do not require large values of @xmath4  @xcite will have the additional benefit of preserving the long spin lifetime of the individual qubits .    applying a magnetic field </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath94  t. in this regime , we found no @xmath9-dependence of @xmath63 ( data not shown ) , as expected for orbital relaxation at low fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data was not conclusive enough to extract further information on the spin relaxation rate @xmath95 . at @xmath96  t , @xmath97 ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath98 becomes the spin ground state . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the zeeman - split @xmath50 states load with equal probability , and neglecting the single - spin relaxation channels between triplet states ( for which @xmath99  s at 2.5 t  @xcite ) , the rate equation model becomes : @xmath100 a fit to the data in a yields @xmath101  ms , @xmath102  ms , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . since @xmath106 , </S>",

    "<S> the long - time plateau of @xmath62 is due to nuclear spin selection rules sketched in the inset ( see text ) . </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , we observe a constant population of @xmath7 for @xmath115  ms . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals a subtle feature of the spin relaxation mechanism of borhani and hu  @xcite : the hyperfine interaction @xmath80 mixes states having the same total value of the electron ( @xmath116 ) and nuclear ( @xmath117 ) spin quantum number . </S>",
    "<S> the transition @xmath108 yields @xmath118 , thus requires @xmath119 , and becomes forbidden if the @xmath2p nuclei are in the state @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the long - time plateau of @xmath62 as a manifestation of this spins selection rule . </S>",
    "<S> the plateau height should depend on the probability that @xmath121 , which is unknown and uncontrolled in this experiment , but we may assume that the nuclei randomly populate all possible states over the time necessary to acquire a set of data as in .    </S>",
    "<S> the time - resolved observation of singlet and triplet states of an exchange - coupled @xmath2p donor pair reported here provides a physical basis for the construction of large - scale donor - based quantum computer architectures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the short @xmath122 relaxation times @xmath3  ms in this experiment arise from the interplay of a large exchange coupling @xmath0  @xmath1ev with the hyperfine interaction @xmath123  mhz  @xmath90  @xmath1ev . </S>",
