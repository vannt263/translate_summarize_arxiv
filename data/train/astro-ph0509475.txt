    "low surface brightness ( lsb ) spiral galaxies are defined as having central disk surface brightnesses @xmath3  23 mag arcsec@xmath4 , indicating low stellar surface densities . however , despite their faint optical appearances , the majority of lsb spirals show evidence for ongoing star formation , including blue colors , h@xmath5 emission and/or resolved populations of young stars ( e.g. , schombert et al .",
    "1992 ; gallagher & matthews 2002 ) .",
    "signatures of star formation are frequently coupled with large atomic gas fractions ( @xmath61 ) , underscoring that lsb spirals are not the faded remnants of brighter galaxies . in a number of cases ,",
    "evidence is also seen for stellar populations spanning a wide range of ages ( e.g. , van den hoek et al . 2000 ) , implying that lsb spirals have been forming stars for a significant fraction of a hubble time  but with low efficiency .",
    "lingering questions regarding the evolutionary history of lsb spirals are _ why _ their star formation has remained suppressed , and what physical processes regulate the type of low - level star formation that is observed in these systems . given that lsb spirals comprise a significant fraction ( @xmath750% ) of the local disk galaxy population ( e.g. , minchin et al .",
    "2004 ) , answers to these questions are crucial for our overall understanding of the star formation history of the universe .",
    "in addition , they are relevant to understanding star formation in other low - density and/or low - metallicity environments , including protogalaxies , the outskirts of giant galaxies , and damped ly@xmath5 absorption systems .",
    "key to understanding the process of star formation in lsb spirals is an improved knowledge of the composition and structure of their interstellar medium ( ism ) . to date , most of our knowledge of the ism in lsb spirals comes from studies of their gas , which appears to be by far the dominant component of their ism (  95% by mass ) .",
    "studies have shown that while is typically present throughout the stellar disk of lsb spirals , surface densities often fall below the critical threshold for instability - driven star formation throughout most or all of their disks ( e.g. , van der hulst et al . 1993 ; de blok et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "in a broad sense , the low densities of lsb spirals seem to account naturally for their inefficient star formation . however , this explanation is not entirely satisfactory for several reasons .",
    "first , important ism parameters including the gas scale height , volume density , and turbulent velocity remain poorly constrained .",
    "secondly , we know some star formation is occurring in lsb spirals in spite of subcritical surface densities .",
    "furthermore , it is ultimately from the molecular , not the atomic gas that stars form .",
    "it is clear that a more comprehensive picture of star formation in lsb spirals requires a more complete knowledge of their multi - phase ism .",
    "unfortunately , direct searches for molecular gas in lsb spirals have proved to be challenging .",
    "indeed , initial searches for co emission from late - type , lsb spirals failed to yield any detections ( schombert et al .",
    "1990 ; de blok & van der hulst 1998 ) , leading to the suggestions that the metallicities of typical lsb spiral may be too low for the formation of co molecules or efficient cooling of the gas , that the interstellar pressures may be insufficient to support molecular clouds , or that star formation may occur directly from the atomic medium ( schombert et al .",
    "1990 ; bothun et al .",
    "1997 ; mihos et al .",
    "1999 ) .      to partially circumvent the challenges of detecting co emission from lsb spirals , my collaborators and i began surveying examples of lsb spirals viewed _",
    "edge - on _ , using observations 2 - 3 times deeper than previous studies .",
    "our targets comprised extreme late - type ( scd - sm ) lsb spirals with redshifts @xmath82000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "two advantages of our approach are : ( 1 ) the column depth of the molecular gas is enhanced for an edge - on geometry ; and ( 2 ) an edge - on viewing angle allows complementary studies of the vertical structure of various ism and stellar components of the galaxies at other wavelengths .    in a pilot survey with the nrao 12-m telescope , we detected for the first time @xmath9co(1 - 0 ) emission from three late - type , lsb spiral galaxies ( matthews & gao 2001 ) .",
    "more recently , we followed up with a more extensive survey of 15 lsb spirals in both the @xmath9co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath9co(2 - 1 ) lines using the iram 30-m telescope ( matthews et al .",
    "2005 ; hereafter m05 ) . in this latter survey , we detected co emission from the nuclear regions of four lsb spirals , one of which was previously detected by matthews & gao ( 2001 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) . for the galaxies detected in these two surveys",
    ", we estimate the molecular hydrogen content of the nuclear regions ( central 1 - 3  kpc ) to be @xmath10 , assuming a standard galactic co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor . while the conversion of co flux to h@xmath11 mass in low - density",
    ", low - metallicity galaxies can be rather uncertain , _",
    "these observations have clearly established that at least some bulgeless , late - type , lsb spirals contain modest amounts of molecular gas in their nuclear regions , and that co traces at least some fraction of this gas .",
    "_ in addition , our results establish that a bulge is not a prerequisite for the presence of molecular gas at the centers of low - density lsb galaxies .",
    "therefore our surveys extend the realm of co - detected lsb spirals from the giant , bulge - dominated lsb systems detected by oneil et al .",
    "( 2000,2003 ) and oneil & schinnerer ( 2004 ) to the more common , low - mass , pure - disk lsb systems .    while the samples of late - type , lsb spirals surveyed in co are still small , already some interesting trends are emerging . here",
    "i briefly describe two of our key findings . for further results and discussion ,",
    "i refer the reader to m05 .      for bright ,",
    "massive spiral galaxies , there is a well - established correlation between far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity and h@xmath11 mass ( or co luminosity ; e.g. , young & scoville 1991 ) .",
    "this correlation is assumed to arise from heating of dust grains embedded in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) by hot young stars .",
    "there are a number of reasons why this correlation might break down for lsb spirals ; for example , if molecular gas in lsb spirals resides primarily outside gmcs , if their stellar mass function is biased toward low - mass stars ( lee et al .",
    "2004 ) , or if the appropriate co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor for these galaxies is very different from what we have assumed .",
    "[ fig : fir ] shows a plot of the nuclear h@xmath11 masses ( or 3@xmath12 upper limits ) for our co survey galaxies , versus the fir luminosity derived from _",
    "iras _ data . also plotted is a sample of extreme late - type spirals recently surveyed in co by boeker et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter b03 ) .",
    "the b03 sample comprises the same range of redshifts and hubble types as our lsb spiral co surveys , but covers a wide range in surface brightness , including two lsb spirals [ @xmath13  mag arcsec@xmath4 ] , 15 intermediate surface brightness ( isb ) spirals [ @xmath15  mag arcsec@xmath4 ] , and 25 high surface brightness ( hsb ) spirals .",
    "also overplotted as a solid line on fig .",
    "[ fig : fir ] is the h@xmath11-fir relation derived by b03 for a sample of brighter , more massive galaxies .",
    "[ fig : fir ] reveals that the co - detected lsb spirals delineate a remarkably tight extension of the h@xmath11-fir defined by brighter galaxies .",
    "only a handful of the lsb / isb galaxies undetected in co show evidence of possible deviation from this correlation .",
    "our findings suggest that as in brighter galaxies , the co detected in lsb spirals is associated with dense molecular clouds and sights of massive star formation rather than a more diffuse molecular medium .    [",
    "[ a - link - between - disk - rotational - velocity - and - the - detectability - of - co - in - low - mass - galaxies ] ] a link between disk rotational velocity and the detectability of co in low - mass galaxies ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    fig .",
    "[ fig : w20 ] plots the nuclear h@xmath11 mass versus the inclination - corrected total linewidth ( @xmath16 ) for the same samples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fir ] .",
    "@xmath17 is related to the maximum rotational velocity of disk galaxies as @xmath18 ( see m05 ) .",
    "we see that for larger rotational velocities ( @xmath19 km s@xmath2 ) , the quantities plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : w20 ] shows a nearly flat correlation .",
    "however , for galaxies with @xmath20 km s@xmath2 ( corresponding to @xmath190 km s@xmath2 ) , the inferred nuclear h@xmath11 mass ( i.e. , the co detectability ) begins to drop significantly , and no isb or lsb spirals below this limit have so far been detected in co. as discussed by m05 , it appears that neither decreasing mean surface density , nor decreasing metallicity among the lower mass galaxies can fully account for this trend .",
    "[ fig : w20 ] therefore points toward a decreasing concentration of molecular gas in the inner regions of galaxies with decreasing rotational velocity .",
    "this trend seems to depend only weakly on optical central surface brightness in the sense that both lsb and isb galaxies show similar declines in co detectability with @xmath21 , although a few hsb systems with low @xmath21 do have co detections .",
    "it is interesting to note that the characteristic velocity , @xmath2290",
    "km s@xmath2 , below which we see a decline in the detectability of co among late - type spirals is similar to the velocity characterizing a slope change in the optical tully - fisher relation for -rich , extreme late - type disks found by matthews et al .",

    "2005 ) , and the rotational velocity below which galaxy dust lanes are seen to disappear ( @xmath24120 km s@xmath2 ; dalcanton et al .",
    "_ all of these results are consistent with fundamental changes in some key parameter(s ) governing the ism conditions and the regulation of star formation in low - mass galaxies_. possible causes could include : a decreasing fraction the disk unstable to gmc formation ( e.g. , li et al . 2005 ) , a change in the characteristic velocity for turbulence ( dalcanton et al .",
    "2004 ) , an increasing fraction of the disk below the critical pressure needed for the existence of a cold ism phase ( elmegreen & parravano 1994 ) , the increasing dominance of gas relative to stars in the underlying disk potential , and/or decreasing effects of rotational shear ( e.g. , martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
