    "a theoretical understanding of hadronic @xmath1 decays is necessary to extract ckm matrix elements and cp - violating weak phases from data taken at the @xmath1 factories .",
    "the formalism of qcd factorization developed in @xcite has shown that two - body hadronic @xmath1 decays simplify considerably in the heavy - quark limit . in @xmath3",
    "decays , for example , qcd factorization states that the matrix elements of the local operators @xmath4 appearing in the effective weak hamiltonian obey the factorization formula @xmath5 where @xmath6 are leading - twist light - cone distribution amplitudes , and the @xmath7-products imply integration over the light - cone momentum fractions of the constituent quarks inside the mesons .",
    "the hard - scattering kernels @xmath8 are perturbatively calculable quantities .",
    "the factorization formula is true to all orders in perturbation theory , but it receives power corrections in @xmath9 . if qcd factorization is to be used as a tool for extracting the flavor parameters of the standard model , it is important to show that these power corrections are not anomalously large .",
    "some sources of power corrections were identified and estimated in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the renormalon calculus was used to study power corrections due to soft gluon exchange in the decays @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a light meson . here",
    "we generalize and extend these analyses to focus on soft gluon corrections to the amplitudes for @xmath1 decays into two light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the model of power corrections that we develop relies on the analysis of infrared ( ir ) renormalon singularities , which arise because the low - momentum regions in loop diagrams give increasingly important contributions at higher orders in perturbation theory @xcite , rendering perturbation theory a divergent asymptotic expansion .",
    "ir renormalons are most transparently studied through singularities in the borel transforms of perturbation series with respect to the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the borel transform @xmath12 of the perturbation series for a physical quantity has poles ( or branch cuts ) at half - integer values of the borel variable @xmath13 , which lead to ambiguities of order @xmath14 when performing the inverse transform , a process to which we will refer as borel resummation .",
    "( here @xmath15 is the large momentum scale in the process . ) since the final answer for a physical quantity must be unambiguous , these renormalon ambiguities should be combined with power corrections of the same order in @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , an analysis of ir renormalons may reveal non - trivial information about power corrections to various processes , which is particularly useful in cases where such corrections can not be analyzed using an operator product expansion ( see @xcite for early applications of this idea ) .",
    "we calculate the borel transforms of the hard - scattering kernels appearing in the qcd factorization formula using the so - called `` large-@xmath17 limit '' , in which the momentum flow through gluon lines is traced by inserting fermion bubbles on the propagators , replacing @xmath18 at the end of the calculation @xcite . in this way , the diagrams are effectively computed using a momentum - dependent running coupling at the vertices .",
    "this procedure gives the dominant higher - order contributions to a perturbation series in the very formal limit where @xmath19 , in which case @xmath20 with fixed number of colors .",
    "although for real qcd @xmath21 is not a large parameter , the use of the large-@xmath17 limit is motivated by the empirical observation that perturbation series are often dominated by terms of the form @xmath22 .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate both the wilson coefficients and the hard - scattering kernels entering the qcd factorization formula at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the large-@xmath17 limit .",
    "this is necessary for obtaining renormalization - group ( rg ) invariant expressions for the physical decay amplitudes .",
    "the expansion of the wilson coefficients in the large-@xmath17 limit is a novel feature of our work , which goes beyond the approach taken in @xcite .",
    "the numerical study in section  [ numerical ] helps to elucidate the main results of our work .",
    "we find that the power corrections to qcd factorization due to soft - gluon exchange are small , typically of order @xmath23 .",
    "the only exception is a first - order power correction to the hard - spectator term , which is to be expected considering that the effective scale for gluon exchange with the spectator quark is of order @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "perhaps our most important result is that the strong - interaction phases of the decay amplitudes increase significantly when going beyond one - loop order in perturbation theory .",
    "this can potentially enhance the direct cp asymmetries in decays such as @xmath25 and @xmath3 with respect to the predictions found at nlo in rg - improved perturbation theory in @xcite . whether or not such increased asymmetries are realistic depends on whether there are significant multi - loop contributions not captured in the large-@xmath17 limit .",
    "we leave a more careful analysis of such contributions for future work .",
    "[ sec - wilson ]    the qcd factorization formula provides model - independent expressions for hadronic weak decay amplitudes at leading power in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "all non - trivial strong - interaction effects , which give corrections to the so - called `` naive '' factorization ( vacuum insertion ) approximation , are contained in rg - invariant parameters @xmath26 , which are products of wilson coefficients with convolutions of hard - scattering kernels and meson light - cone distribution amplitudes . in order to obtain rg - invariant results",
    ", it is crucial that the wilson coefficients and hard - scattering kernels be treated in the same perturbative approximation scheme .",
    "since our goal is to resum the perturbation series for the hard - scattering kernels in the large-@xmath17 limit , we must first compute the wilson coefficients appearing in the effective weak hamiltonian in the same limit .",
    "this is non - trivial , since the counting scheme underlying the large-@xmath17 limit is different from the usual counting of logarithms used in the calculation of the wilson coefficients . specifically , whereas @xmath27 is considered @xmath28 in the usual rg counting , this quantity is @xmath29 in the large-@xmath17 limit . on the contrary , whereas @xmath30 is usually treated as a small parameter , it is considered @xmath28 in the large-@xmath17 limit .",
    "consider , as an example , the rare hadronic decays @xmath25 , for which the effective weak hamiltonian ( neglecting small contributions from electroweak penguins ) is @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 are products of ckm matrix elements .",
    "the scale dependence of the wilson coefficients is governed by the evolution equation ( in compact matrix notation ) @xmath33\\ ,     \\vec c(m ) \\,,\\ ] ] where the evolution matrix is given in terms of an ordered matrix exponential involving the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath34 and the @xmath35-function .",
    "the initial values @xmath36 at a scale @xmath37 are obtained by matching the standard model onto a low - energy effective theory , in which the heavy fields of the electroweak gauge bosons and the top quark are integrated out .",
    "to evaluate ( [ evolution ] ) at subleading order in the large-@xmath17 limit , we expand the qcd @xmath35-function as @xmath38 , where the rescaled coupling @xmath39 is @xmath28 in the large-@xmath17 limit .",
    "next , we change variables from @xmath40 to @xmath41 in the integral in ( [ evolution ] ) , write the anomalous dimension matrix as a function of @xmath41 , and expand in powers of @xmath42 . taking into account that factors of @xmath43 must be replaced with @xmath44 , we find that in @xmath45 block form the resulting matrix is given by @xmath46 the justification for writing the leading term in this expansion as a constant @xmath47 matrix @xmath48 times the coupling constant @xmath41 is that this corner of the anomalous dimension matrix does not pick up an additional factor of @xmath43 when going from leading order ( lo ) to next - to - leading order in perturbation theory , so that all further perturbative contributions are absorbed in the matrix @xmath49 , the form of which is irrelevant to our discussion .",
    "a similar argument applies to the submatrix in the lower left corner , which at order @xmath42 is given by a constant @xmath50 matrix @xmath51 times @xmath41 .",
    "the matrix @xmath52 governing the evolution of the current  current operators @xmath53 in the large-@xmath17 limit is a non - trivial function of the coupling , which has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of colors , and @xmath56 the matrices @xmath48 and @xmath51 can be derived from the expressions for the lo anomalous dimension matrices given in @xcite : @xmath57 taking into account the textures of these matrices as well as corresponding relations between the matching conditions for the various coefficients at the scale @xmath58 , we find that the solutions for the wilson coefficients can be expanded as @xmath59 where @xmath60 up to @xmath29 , the wilson coefficients @xmath61 are thus determined in terms of two functions , given by @xmath62 the coefficient of the chromo - magnetic operator @xmath63 will be needed only at lo , where it is scale independent , i.e. , @xmath64    note that , as a consequence of the fact that the matrix @xmath48 has eigenvalues 0 and @xmath65 , the scale dependence of the penguin coefficients @xmath66 governed by the function @xmath67 is extremely simple , and given by @xmath68 .",
    "we will see below that the appearance of a logarithm is indeed required to cancel the scale dependence of the hard - scattering kernels associated with penguin contractions of the operators @xmath4 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in regards to the numerical significance of higher - order perturbative corrections , the most striking effect is the large increase of the imaginary part of the coefficient @xmath69 as one goes to higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "an analysis using momentum distribution functions shows that the imaginary part of the hard - scattering kernel contributing to @xmath69 is dominated by contributions from scales of order a gev , indicating that it can receive large higher - order corrections @xcite",
    ". the corresponding strong - interaction phase may therefore be larger than that obtained from the nlo analysis .    in the strict large-@xmath17 limit ( shown by the numbers in brackets ) , the penguin coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 mirror the behavior of @xmath69 . on the other hand , when the physical value @xmath72 is used as in ( [ repl ] ) , the phases are reasonably close to those at nlo and do not receive large higher - order corrections .",
    "this shows that after the replacement in ( [ repl ] ) there is a strong cancellation between the different terms in ( [ sk23 ] ) , which is maintained at higher orders .",
    "while the replacement in ( [ repl ] ) was motivated on physical grounds , it is an open and important question whether such a delicate cancellation will persist once the full set of nnlo corrections is included in the theory of qcd factorization .",
    "this section addresses the effects of renormalon ambiguities and higher - order corrections on the phenomenology of @xmath1 decays into two light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the results of section  [ numerical ] have shown that the most notable effects are the ambiguity in the hard - spectator term and an increase in the imaginary parts of the kernels at higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we limit our phenomenological analysis to quantities that highlight these effects in a transparent way .",
    "the @xmath73 decay amplitudes depend strongly on @xmath69 ( see ( [ bpipi ] ) ) and are therefore a good probe of the renormalon ambiguity in the hard - spectator term . using the data in table  [ tab - numai ] , and taking @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ", we find for the cp - averaged branching ratio @xmath76 where the numbers in parentheses refer to one - loop order , two - loop order , and borel - resummation , respectively .",
    "the nlo result obtained using qcd factorization is 4.80 .",
    "( the central value quoted in @xcite is about 10% larger due to the inclusion of electroweak penguin contributions . )",
    "the magnitude of the renormalon ambiguity may be compared with the error estimate given in @xcite , where an uncertainty of @xmath77 was assigned to account for the effects of parameter variations and power corrections from higher - twist distribution amplitudes .",
    "since this is the mode that is the most vulnerable to the ambiguity in @xmath69 , we are led to the conclusion that no large power corrections from soft gluon exchange are present in @xmath78 decays .",
    "the cp asymmetries of certain decays can be very sensitive to the imaginary parts of the hard - scattering kernels and show clearly the effects of borel resummation .",
    "as examples , we discuss the asymmetries for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which to first approximation are given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "using asymptotic distribution amplitudes , the @xmath26 parameters for @xmath3 decays are identical to those for @xmath25 . in figure",
    "[ fig : plots ] , results for the two cp asymmetries are shown both in the strict large-@xmath83 limit ( right ) and in the modified scheme discussed in section  [ sec : mod ] . in both schemes , the asymmetries increase strongly at higher orders in perturbation theory , such that the borel - resummed results are almost a factor of two larger than the results found at one - loop order .",
    "the two - loop contributions appear to be the most important higher - order effects .",
    "this trend suggests that the asymmetries predicted from exact nlo calculations in @xcite will become larger upon the inclusion of higher - order terms .",
    "( as concerns the magnitude of the cp asymmetries , we believe that the true values will be somewhere in between the two schemes . ) it is also apparent from the figure that , in all cases , higher - order perturbative corrections are much more important than the power corrections suggested by the values of the renormalon ambiguities .",
    "this provides additional motivation for calculating the imaginary part of the hard - scattering kernels at two - loop order .",
    "in fact , the two - loop imaginary parts ( combined with the one - loop real parts ) of the decay amplitudes are required for a consistent description of the cp asymmetries at nlo in rg - improved perturbation theory .",
    "in this paper we have used the renormalon calculus and the large-@xmath17 limit of qcd to develop a toy model for higher - order corrections to the qcd factorization approach as applied to @xmath1 decays into two light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "we have presented novel results for the wilson coefficients in the large-@xmath17 limit , and have used them to show that the rg invariance of the hard - scattering kernels entering the qcd factorization formula is preserved under borel resummation .",
    "both the wilson coefficients and the coefficient functions @xmath26 appearing in the amplitudes for @xmath78 decays simplify greatly in the large-@xmath17 limit , but still allow for a realistic study of power corrections and higher - order perturbative contributions to qcd factorization .",
    "we have presented exact expressions for the borel transforms of the hard - scattering kernels in the factorization formula , from which is it possible to derive the terms of order @xmath22 in the perturbative expansions of the kernels .",
    "we have analysed the power corrections from soft gluon exchange and obtained a simple model for the first and second - order corrections to the parameters @xmath26 .",
    "the only numerically significant power correction arises from soft gluon exchange with the spectator quark , which introduces an error in the cp - averaged @xmath73 branching ratio of about ten percent .",
    "this is roughly the same as the errors associated with the hadronic uncertainties and power corrections that were estimated in @xcite .",
    "the power corrections to the real part of the penguin coefficients are of order @xmath23 , and those to the imaginary part are zero within the large-@xmath17 limit , which offers numerical evidence against models proposing dynamically enhanced penguins .",
    "a recurring result of our study is that the imaginary parts of the hard - scattering kernels may be larger than expected from previous applications of qcd factorization .",
    "a calculation of the imaginary part of the kernels at two - loop order would be highly desirable , since it would give an answer to the question of whether there are large multi - loop contributions to these decays that are not captured in the large-@xmath17 limit .",
