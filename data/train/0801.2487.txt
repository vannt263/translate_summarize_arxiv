    "the planetary atmospheres are charged with such mixtures in suspension .",
    "the interaction between oceans and atmosphere generates mixtures of gas and water vapor partially condensed in form of fine droplets .",
    "aerosols are also created by sprays and are important even in the car industry on the level of combustion in petrol and air mixture .",
    "the literature abounds on the study of nucleation times , on the growth of germs in vapor mixtures and on the motion of microscopic droplets @xcite .",
    "+ aerosols consist of liquid droplets of very small radius ( from 0.1 to 10 microns ) in suspension in a vapor - gas mixture ; the droplet number is assumed weak enough to avoid interactions ( smaller than one hundred thousand droplets per a cubic centimeter which corresponds to a volume proportion smaller than one for thousand ) .",
    "+ in this paper , we prove that for given conditions of pressure and temperature the number of droplets per unit volume can not exceed a maximum value .",
    "the value depends on the surface tension of gas - vapor / liquid interface and on the difference between the pressure of gas supersaturated with vapor and that of gas with saturated vapor .",
    "the energy necessary to the creation of the droplets is limited ; providing to a gas - vapor mixture an energy higher than this limit does not increase the droplet density .",
    "in a large - sized isothermal tank of volume @xmath4 , we consider a mixture constituted of two fluids labelled with indices 1 and 2 .",
    "fluid 1 is supposed at a temperature much lower than its critical temperature and coexists in form of liquid and vapor bulks .",
    "fluid 2 is supposed at a temperature much upper than its critical temperature and behaves like a perfect gas ( we call it the gas ) .",
    "an example of mixture verifying such conditions is that of water in liquid and vapor forms in presence of air at the ambient temperature . we propose to determine the equilibrium of @xmath5 liquid droplets with a dissolved gas in presence of supersaturated vapor in the gas .",
    "the droplets form a fog and their volume fraction is small enough so that they do not interact .",
    "the tank is large enough so that the boundary effects are neglected .",
    "let us denote @xmath6 the total mass of fluid @xmath7 .",
    "the mixture is distributed between a gas - vapor bulk @xmath8 of volume @xmath9 and whose densities are denoted @xmath10 and the @xmath5 droplets of liquid with dissolved gas of densities @xmath11 represented by a bulk @xmath12 .",
    "the radius droplet is small ( of micron order ) and the forces due to gravity are negligible . at equilibrium ,",
    "the droplets are spherical and it is easy to notice that they are all identical with a volume @xmath13 . the volume free energy of the mixture is denoted @xmath14 . in a van der waals model , it is a non convex function of the densities @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the surface tension @xmath17 of interfaces separating the bulks @xmath12 and @xmath8 is assumed to be independent of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this approximation corresponds to the fact that density values will be limited to small domains near the phase equilibrium . by taking into account the surface energy of the @xmath5 droplets ,",
    "the total free energy of the mixture in the tank is @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "volumes and densities of the mixture bulks are submitted to the constraints @xmath20 the research of mixture equilibrium reduces to study the extremum of @xmath21 where @xmath22 are three scalar lagrange multipliers .",

    "however , this result is not used in explicit calculations and the maximum number of droplets does not take into account the non - convex part of the free energy since the densities of components are near equilibrium densities associated with the liquid and its saturated vapor in presence of a gas .",
    "the result is obtained for a gas and a vapor considered as perfect gases .",
