    "it is a well known and intriguing fact that , in the genetic code , 64 codons code the biosynthesis of 20 amino - acids ( a.a . ) with a structure in multiplets reported in table [ tablerep ] .",
    "+ it is also a well known and , at our knowledge , unexplained fact that the frequency rate of usage ( codon usage ) of the different codons inside a multiplet is not the same .",
    "+ it is the aim of this paper to emphasize for the vertebrate series a correlation in the codon usage , in the quartets and sextets , which is naturally explained in the framework of the mathematical model of the genetic code recently proposed by the authors @xcite .",
    "moreover we put in evidence an universal function behaviour connected with the codon usage , which also finds a justification in the model .",
    "2 we recall the essential features of the model and in sec .",
    "3 we present the analysis of the codon usage for a set of biological sequences in the vertebrate series @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall some properties of the crystal basis @xcite .",
    "we limit ourselves to the case of @xmath0 , but such basis exists for any finite dimensional representation of @xmath1 , @xmath2 being any ( semi)-simple classical lie algebra .",
    "the crystal basis has the nice property , for @xmath3 , that in the limit @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 where the operators @xmath7 are a redefinition , using an element of the center , of the generators @xmath8 of @xmath3 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the basis vectors of the irreducible representation labelled by @xmath11 ( @xmath11 being an integer or half - integer ) .",
    "the labels of the irreducible representation are connected to the eigenvalues of the `` casimir '' operator @xmath12 : @xmath13 its eigenvalue on any vector basis of the irreducible @xmath11-representation is @xmath14 .",
    "+ moreover any state in the tensor product of two irreducible representations @xmath15 is written in the crystal basis as one and only one tensor product of a @xmath16 state by a @xmath17 state @xcite . for example , taking for @xmath16 and @xmath17 the two - dimensional representation @xmath18 of @xmath19 with states @xmath20 and @xmath21 , one will get in @xmath15 the @xmath22 representation displayed by @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the @xmath26 representation with the state @xmath27 .",
    "now let us state the main hypothesis of our model @xcite .",
    "* assumption i * - the four nucleotides containing the bases : adenine @xmath28 and guanine @xmath29 , deriving from purine , and cytosine @xmath30 and thymine @xmath31 , coming from pyrimidine , are the basis vectors of a crystal basis of the @xmath32 irreducible representation of the quantum algebra @xmath33 in the limit @xmath4 . in the following ,",
    "we denote with @xmath34 the basis vector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath35 of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 specifies the generator of the first ( second ) @xmath38 .",
    "we assume the following `` spin '' structure ( we remind that the thymine @xmath39 in the dna is replaced by the uracile @xmath40 in the rna ) : @xmath41 let us remark that the @xmath42-symmetry is associated to the purine - pyrimidine structure , while the @xmath43-symmetry reflects the complementarity rule ( that is @xmath44 and @xmath45 interactions )",
    ". +    * assumption ii * - the _ codons _ are the basis vectors , in the crystal basis , of the irreducible representations build up by the tensor product of three 4-dimensional @xmath46 fundamental representations describing the nucleotides .",
    "+ we have reported in table [ tablerep ] the assignment of the codons classified in the representations which appear in the r.h.s . of the following relation : @xmath47    in @xcite , an operator ( called the _ reading or ribosome operator _ )",
    "@xmath48 has been constructed out of the algebra @xmath49 , which describes the multiplet structure of the the genetic code in the following way : _ two codons have the same eigenvalue under @xmath48 if and only if they are associated to the same amino - acid_. moreover an `` hamiltonian '' depending on 4 parameters has been build up which gives a very satisfactory fit of the 16 values of the free energy released in the folding of a rna sequence into a base paired double helix .",
    "let us close this section by drawing the reader s attention to fig .",
    "[ figa ] where is specified for each codon its position in the appropriate representation .",
    "the diagram of states for each representation is supposed to lie in a separate parallel plane .",
    "thick lines connect codons associated to the same amino - acid .",
    "one remarks that each segment relates a couple of codons belonging to the same representation or to two different representations .",
    "this last case occurs for quadruplets or sextets of codons associated to the same amino - acid .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to show a remarkable relation between such multiplets of codons ( or amino - acids ) involving the same subset of representation and ( branching ratios of ) the probabilities of presence of codons in the amino - acid biosynthesis .",
    "we define the codon usage as the frequency of use of a given codon in the process of biosynthesis of all the amino - acids .",
    "we define the probability of usage of the codon @xmath50 of a given amino - acid as the ratio between the occurrence of the codon @xmath50 and the occurrence @xmath51 of the corresponding amino - acid , i.e. as the relative codon frequency , in the limit of very large @xmath51 . here and in the following the labels",
    "@xmath52 represent the bases @xmath53 .",
    "the frequency rate of usage of a codon in a multiplet is connected to its probability of usage @xmath54 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath54 depends on :  the biological organism ( b.o . )",
    "from which the sequence considered has been extracted +  the sequence analyzed +  the nature of the neighboring codons in the sequence +  the amino - acid ( a.a . ) +  the nature and structure of the multiplet associated to the amino - acid +  the biological environment +  the properties of the codon itself ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we neglect the time in which the biosynthesis process takes place as we assume that the biosynthesis processes are considered at the same time , at least compared to the time scale of evolution of the genetic code .",
    "we define the _ branching ratio _ @xmath55 as @xmath56 we argue that in the limit of very large number of codons , for a fixed biological organism and amino - acid , the branching ratio depends essentially on the properties of the codon . in our model",
    "this means that in this limit @xmath55 is a function , depending on the type of the multiplet , on the _ quantum numbers _ of the codons @xmath50 and @xmath57 , i.e. on the labels @xmath58 , where @xmath59 or @xmath43 , and on an other set of quantum labels leaving out the degeneracy on @xmath60 ; in table [ tablerep ] different irreducible representations with the same values of @xmath60 are distinguished by an upper label",
    ". moreover we assume that @xmath55 , in the limit above specified , depends only on the irreducible representation ( ir ) of the codons , i.e. : @xmath61 let us point out that the branching ratio has a meaning only if the codons @xmath50 and @xmath62 are in the same multiplet , i.e. if they code the same amino - acid . + we consider the quartets and sextets .",
    "there are five quartets and three sextets in the eukariotic code : that will allow a rather detailed analysis .",
    "moreover the 3 sextets appear as the sum of a quartet and a doublet , see table [ tablerep ] . in the following we consider only the quartet sub - part of the sextets .",
    "we recall that the 5 amino - acids coded by the quartets are : [ pro , ala , thr , gly , val ] and the 3 amino - acids coded by the sextets are : [ leu , arg , ser ] .",
    "there are , for the quartets , 6 branching ratios , of which only 3 are independent .",
    "we choose as fundamental ones the ratios @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it happens that we can define several functions @xmath55 , considering ratios of probability of codons differing for the first two nucleotides @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67      the analysis was performed on a set of data retrieved from the data bank of `` codon usage tabulated from genbank '' @xcite .",
    "in particular we analyzed two different data set : the first one comprises all the data of at least 2 000 codons , while the second set represents all the data with at least 30 000 codons .",
    "the referring organism for the analysis was _ homo sapiens _ , whose codon usage table derives from the analysis of more than 12 500 coding sequences , and corresponds to about 6 000 000 codons .",
    "three quartets , coding the amino - acids pro , ala and thr , have exactly the same content in irreducible representations , see table [ tablerep ] . in table [ tabledata ] we report the 16 biological organisms with highest statistics . in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] the @xmath63 , @xmath65 and @xmath64 are reported for the 8 amino - acids coded by the quartets and sextets showing :    * a clear correlation between the four amino - acids pro , ala , thr and ser . from table",
    "[ tablerep ] we see that for these amino - acids the irreducible representation involved in the numerator of the branching ratios ( see ( [ eq8 ] ) ) is always the same : @xmath71 for @xmath63 , @xmath72 for @xmath65 , @xmath73 for @xmath64 , while the irreducible representation in the denominator is @xmath71 for the whole set .",
    "the relative position of each of these quartets of codons can be more easily visualized in fig . [ figa ] where pro , ala , thr and ser ( quartet part ) constitute the four edges of a vertical column linking the representation @xmath71 , sitting at the ground floor , first to the representation @xmath74 , then to the @xmath72 one and finally to the representation @xmath73 , this last one located at the top floor . * a clear correlation between the two amino - acids val and leu . from table [ tablerep ]",
    "we see that also for these two amino - acids the irreducible representation in the numerator of ( [ eq8 ] ) is the same : @xmath75 for @xmath63 , @xmath76 for @xmath65 , @xmath76 for @xmath64 , and the irreducible representation in the denominator is @xmath75 . considering fig .",
    "[ figa ] , it is now the two representations @xmath77 and @xmath76 which are brought together , the codons associated to val and leu ( quartet part ) determining the vertices of two parallel and vertical plaquettes . * no correlation of the arg and also of the gly with the others amino - acids , in agreement with the irreducible representation assignment of table [ tablerep ] .",
    "indeed we can note in fig .",
    "[ figa ] that the representations @xmath78 and @xmath79 are connected by the codon quartet relative to arg and ( but ) only by this multiplet .",
    "we also remark the gly quartet in the representations @xmath72 and @xmath80 : its position is completely different from the above discussed quartets which show up in these representations .",
    "then in figs . [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ]",
    "we have drawn the normalized branching ratios @xmath81 , @xmath82 , defined by : @xmath83 where the sum @xmath84 is extended to the eight amino - acids above listed .",
