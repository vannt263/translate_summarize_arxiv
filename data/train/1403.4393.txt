    "we consider the possibility of constraining a class of theories of nonminimally coupled gravity @xcite by means of solar system experiments .",
    "nmc gravity is an extension of @xmath0 gravity where the action integral of general relativity ( gr ) is modified in such a way to contain two functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the space - time curvature @xmath3 .",
    "the function @xmath1 has a role analogous to @xmath0 gravity , and the function @xmath2 yields a nonminimal coupling between curvature and the matter lagrangian density . for other nmc gravity theories and their potential applications , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "nmc gravity has been applied to several astrophysical and cosmological problems such as dark matter @xcite , cosmological perturbations @xcite , post - inflationary reheating @xcite or the current accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .    in the present communication , by extending the perturbative study of @xmath0 gravity in @xcite ,",
    "we discuss how a general framework for the study of solar system constraints to nmc gravity can be developed .",
    "the approach is based on a suitable linearization of the field equations of nmc gravity around a cosmological background space - time , where the sun is considered as a perturbation .",
    "solar system observables are computed , then we apply the perturbative approach to the nmc model by bertolami , fraz~ ao and pramos @xcite , which constitutes a natural extension of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) gravity @xcite to the non - minimally coupled case . such a nmc gravity model is able to predict the observed accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "we show that , differently from the pure @xmath4 gravity case , the nmc model can not be constrained by this perturbative method so that it remains , in this respect , a viable theory of gravity .",
    "further details about the subject of the present communication can be found in the manuscript @xcite .",
    "we consider a gravity model with an action functional of the type @xcite , @xmath6 \\ll_m \\right]\\sqrt{-g } \\ , d^4x,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are functions of the ricci scalar curvature @xmath3 , @xmath9 is the lagrangian density of matter and @xmath10 is the metric determinant . by varying the action with respect to the metric",
    "we get the field equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we describe matter as a perfect fluid with negligible pressure : the lagrangian density of matter is @xmath14 and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath15 . we write @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the cosmological mass density and @xmath18 is the sun mass density .",
    "we assume that the metric which describes the spacetime around the sun is a perturbation of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric with scale factor @xmath19 : @xmath20 dt^2 + a^2(t)\\left(\\left[1 + 2\\phi(r , t)\\right ] dr^2 + r^2 d\\omega^2 \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the ricci curvature of the perturbed spacetime is expressed as the sum @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the scalar curvature of the background frw spacetime and @xmath25 is the perturbation due to the sun . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we linearize the field equations assuming that @xmath26 both around and inside the sun .",
    "this assumption means that the curvature @xmath3 of the perturbed spacetime remains close to the cosmological value @xmath24 inside the sun . in gr",
    "such a property of the curvature is not satisfied inside the sun . however , for @xmath0 theories which are characterized by a small value of a suitable mass parameter ( see next section ) , condition ( [ r1-cond ] ) can be satisfied .",
    "for instance , the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) gravity model @xcite satisfies condition ( [ r1-cond ] ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "eventually , we assume that functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 admit a taylor expansion around @xmath27 and that terms nonlinear in @xmath25 can be neglected in the expansion .",
    "we use the notation introduced by @xcite ( for @xmath8 ) : @xmath28",
    "the details of the following computations can be found in the paper @xcite .",
    "first we linearize the trace of the field equations ( [ field - eqs ] ) . using condition ( [ r1-cond ] )",
    ", we neglect @xmath29 contributions but we keep the cross - term @xmath30 . introducing the potential @xmath31 , we get @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the mass parameter @xmath34.\\ ] ] when @xmath35 we recover the mass formula of @xmath0 gravity theory found in @xcite . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath36 at solar system scale . under this assumption",
    "the solution for @xmath25 outside the sun is given by @xmath37 \\frac{m_{\\rm s } } { r},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the mass of the sun .",
    "then we linearize the field equations ( [ field - eqs ] ) obtaining @xmath39 = \\left ( 1 +   f^2_0 \\right ) \\rho^{\\rm s } - 2 f^2_{r0 } \\nabla^2 \\rho^{\\rm s},\\\\ \\nonumber & & \\left ( f^1_{r0 } + 2 f^2_{r0}\\ll_m \\right)\\left ( -\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dr^2 } + \\frac{2}{r}\\frac{d\\phi}{dr } \\right ) -   \\frac{1}{2}f^1_{r0}r_1 + \\frac{2}{r}f^1_{rr0}\\frac{dr_1}{dr } + \\frac{4}{r } f^2_{rr0}\\frac{\\partial\\left(\\ll_m r_1\\right)}{\\partial r } = \\frac{4}{r } f^2_{r0}\\frac{d\\rho^{\\rm s}}{dr}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the divergence theorem and the solution ( [ r1-solution ] ) for @xmath25 , from the first equation we obtain the function @xmath40 outside of the sun : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the radius of the sun .",
    "if the following condition is satisfied , @xmath43 then the function @xmath40 is a newtonian potential : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an effective gravitational constant .",
    "since @xmath46 depends on slowly varying cosmological quantities we have @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 .    the solution for the function @xmath49",
    "is computed from the second of the linearized field equations , and we obtain @xmath50 , where the ppn parameter @xmath51 depends on cosmological quantities and it is given by @xmath52.\\ ] ] when @xmath35 we find the known result @xmath53 which holds for @xmath0 gravity theories which satisfy the condition @xmath36 and condition @xmath54 , as it has been shown in @xcite . the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) gravity theory @xcite , where @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath55 , is one of such theories that , consequently , have to be ruled out by cassini measurement .",
    "we consider the nmc gravity model proposed in @xcite to account for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath59 is a constant .",
    "this model yields a cosmological solution with a negative deceleration parameter @xmath60 , and the scale factor @xmath19 of the background metric follows the temporal evolution @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the current age of the universe . using the properties of the cosmological solution found in @xcite the mass parameter ( [ mass - formula ] ) can be computed obtaining ( we refer to @xcite for details of the computation ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are rational functions of the exponent @xmath66 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the condition @xmath36 imposes the extremely mild constraint @xmath67 . moreover , from the properties of the cosmological solution @xcite we have @xmath68 , from which it follows that condition ( [ newt - limit ] ) is incompatible with the previous constraint @xmath69 : @xmath70 we now check the assumption @xmath54 .",
    "the previous result shows that we can not rely on the validity of newtonian approximation .",
    "hence we can not use the effective gravitational constant @xmath46 defined in ( [ psi - solution ] ) for the estimate of the ratio @xmath71 , so that we resort to newton s gravitational constant @xmath72 .",
    "the value of this ratio outside the sun can be computed from the exterior solution ( [ r1-solution ] ) for @xmath25 , while the result for the interior solution requires a more involved computation , based on a polynomial model of the mass density @xmath18 , that can be found in @xcite : @xmath73 though @xmath54 for @xmath74 , the interior solution shows that non - linear terms in the taylor expansion of @xmath2 can not be neglected , contradicting our assumption at the end of section [ sec : nmc - model ] : @xmath75 + o\\left ( \\left ( \\frac{r_1}{r_0 } \\right)^4 \\right).\\ ] ] the lack of validity of the perturbative regime leads us to conclude that the model ( [ case - study ] ) can not be constrained by this method , so that it remains , in this respect , a viable theory of gravity .",
