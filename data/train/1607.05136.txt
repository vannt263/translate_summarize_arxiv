    "the level of reported confidence intervals are most often 95% , with equal probability of missing the target at both sides . sometimes other levels are used , but rarely are several intervals at their different levels reported in applied work . instead of only reporting one confidence interval we suggest to report a family of nested confidence intervals for parameters of primary interest .",
    "the family is indexed by the confidence level @xmath0 for @xmath1 and is conveniently represented by what is called a _ confidence curve _ , a quantity introduced by @xcite to give a complete picture of the estimation uncertainty . as an example , take @xmath2 for @xmath3 known .",
    "it yields the curve @xmath4 for @xmath5 the cumulative distribution function of a @xmath6 .",

    "the confidence curve has its minimum at @xmath8 which is a point estimate of @xmath9 .",
    "the normal confidence curve is tail - symmetric , i.e. the probability of missing the parameter to the left equals that to the right and is @xmath10 at level @xmath0 .",
    "a tail - symmetric confidence curve represents uniquely a confidence distribution , that is confidence curves that describe upper confidence limits .",
    "confidence distribution is a term coined by @xcite and formally defined in @xcite . for scalar parameters the fiducial distributions developed by @xcite are confidence distributions .",
    "@xcite saw that the fiducial distribution leads to confidence intervals .",
    "@xcite sees confidence distributions as `` simple and interpretable summaries of what can reasonably be learned from the data ( and an assumed model ) '' .",
    "confidence distributions are reviewed by @xcite , and more broadly and with more emphasis on confidence curves by @xcite . in location models and other simple models",
    "the confidence distribution is obtained from pivots , e.g. the normal pivot @xmath11 in the above example .",
    "a canonical pivot is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distribution function of the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath14 , assumed to be absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure and non - increasing in @xmath9 .",

    "the confidence distribution @xmath15 is a canonical pivot in the sense of being uniformly distributed on the unit interval when @xmath14 is distributed according to @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath16 is a sufficient statistic with monotone likelihood ratio , @xmath15 is also optimal in the neyman - pearson sense , that is it describes smaller confidence intervals at a given level when compared to any other confidence distribution for the parameter @xmath9 ( * ? ? ?",

    "median bias correction of a confidence curve , proposed by @xcite , is a method to make the resulting confidence curve approximately tail  symmetric . in the normal example @xmath19 and",

    "this confidence curve is tail - symmetric , as mentioned , and the confidence interval of level @xmath22 is the single point @xmath16 which thus has median @xmath9 and is said to be median unbiased .",

    "the median bias corrected confidence curve is the confidence curve of the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the idea is to probability transform the bias corrected log likelihood ratio @xmath24 rather than @xmath18 . with @xmath25 denoting the sampling distribution of @xmath26 when the data is distributed according to @xmath9 , the bias corrected confidence curve is @xmath27 . since @xmath28 is median unbiased , the level set at @xmath29 is typically the single point @xmath30 and , by continuity , @xmath31 is close to be equal tailedat low levels .",
    "we undertake a theoretical study of the asymptotic properties of @xmath31 by showing that @xmath31 is third - order tail - symmetric for @xmath32 in the normal deviation range in two important classes of parametric models with parameter dimension one .",
    "first , we consider parametric models that belong to the efron s normal transformation family @xcite .",
    "then , we extend the result to regular one dimensional exponential families , where we also discuss the relation between median bias corrected and modified directed likelihood of @xcite , thus providing an alternative approximation to the latter . since median bias correction works so well in these cases , it is reasonable to expect the method to work well quite generally .",
    "however , when a canonical confidence distribution is available , as in the exponential family models , we do of course not advocate to use median bias correction rather than using the canonical confidence distribution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section:2 ]",
    ", we recast confidence estimation in terms of confidence curves and introduce the notation we use in the sequel .",

    ", we investigate its asymptotic properties in terms of tail symmetry in the efron s normal transformation family and in one dimensional exponential families , respectively .",
    "finally , in section [ section:5 ] some concluding remarks and lines of future research are presented , together with an example that provides a preliminary illustration of the use of median bias correction in the presence of nuisance parameters . some proofs and a technical lemma",
