    "the 2h - stacking type of ws@xmath1 with tungsten atoms sandwiched between sulfur layers is supported on the `` sawtooth '' shaped rutile tio@xmath1(100 ) surface , such that the bottom sulfur layer in ws@xmath1 faces rows of oxygen atoms in tio@xmath1 . while the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces of rutile tio@xmath1 have been considered to be the most stable @xcite , a ( 1@xmath83 ) surface reconstruction with a complex structure",
    "is known to occur once oxygen vacancies are induced @xcite .",
    "these vacancies appear at the top of the sawtooth profile in close proximity to the ws@xmath1 layer .",

    "one immediately notices a bright cluster in the center of the image , which corresponds to the nucleation center of the crystal and it likely consists of multi - layered ws@xmath1 .",
    "the silhouette of the triangular shaped sl ws@xmath1 crystal around the nucleation site is barely visible as it only gives rise to a contrast enhancement of @xmath9  % with respect to the bare tio@xmath1 surface .",

    "[ fig:1](d ) reveals the characteristic modes of ws@xmath1 .",
    "these include the in - plane and out - of - plane @xmath10 and @xmath11 modes as well as the second order longitudinal acoustic mode 2la(m ) that gives rise to a broad shoulder on the @xmath10 peak .",
    "we measure a separation of 62  @xmath12 between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 peaks , which is consistent with raman data from sl ws@xmath1 on other substrates @xcite .",
    "the broad peak centered around 450  @xmath12 is attributed to the @xmath13 mode in rutile tio@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the photoluminescence measurement of ws@xmath1 on tio@xmath1 in fig . [ fig:1](e ) reveals a single sharp peak around 2.0  ev , which is characteristic of the neutral exciton in transferred ws@xmath1 and is typically interpreted as a strong indication of the direct band gap transition at @xmath3 in sl ws@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the sl ws@xmath1/tio@xmath1 crystal is inserted in an ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber for peem measurements in order to investigate the spatially resolved electronic properties of the material system .",
    "the peem images shown in figs . [ fig:1](f)-(h ) are obtained using a hg arc discharge lamp , which has an excitation line centered at @xmath44.5  ev .",
    "since this energy is close to the work function @xmath14 of most materials , the main signal derives from emission of secondary electrons around the work function threshold .",
    "the photoemission intensity in figs .",
    "[ fig:1](f)-(h ) therefore reflects the work function values in the two materials , which have been estimated to be 4.13  ev for the tio@xmath1 substrate @xcite and 4.60  ev for sl ws@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the lower work function of tio@xmath1 gives rise to a higher intensity and therefore a remarkable contrast difference between the two materials .",

    "[ fig:1](a ) . the anneal time dependence of the photoemission intensity on the ws@xmath1 and bare tio@xmath1 areas is tracked in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](i ) .",
    "the initial decrease in intensity in both ws@xmath1 and tio@xmath1 is caused by desorption of adsorbates , which increases @xmath14 .",
    "the complex shape of these curves and the rise of intensity on the tio@xmath1 part after @xmath15  min are associated with annealing induced oxygen vacancy formation in the substrate , which decreases @xmath14 @xcite . the behavior is seen to saturate after 20  min .",
    "[ fig:1](h ) presents a closer view of the annealed ws@xmath1 crystal .",
    "we interpret the narrow vertical lines with a spacing on the order of 3.4  @xmath5 m ( see line profile in fig . [ fig:1](j ) ) as tio@xmath1 intensity that is escaping through cracks in the ws@xmath1 film .",
    "these develop due to strain relief during annealing and cooling cycles in the transfer process .",
    "moreover , slight intensity variations are visible between cracks , which could arise from very small changes in the coupling to the substrate and thereby work function , as observed for epitaxial graphene in low energy electron microscopy ( leem ) experiments @xcite .",
    "triangular pits in the ws@xmath1 crystal appear to be pinned at the cracks , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](h ) .",
    "these are consistent with oxidatively etched triangular pits observed in mos@xmath1 , which have been speculated to occur from surface diffusion of chemisorbed oxygen that reacts with defect sites @xcite .    [ t ! ]        spatially resolved x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) measurements of the ti l - edge",
    "are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a)-(c ) .",
    "the xas spectra are sensitive to the chemical composition of the tio@xmath16 octahedral network in the substrate , thereby enabling us to investigate the influence of the ws@xmath1 flake on these .",
    "the data were acquired with xpeem by recording the secondary electron signal as a function of photon energy from the sample in a region where the ws@xmath1 crystal edge is visible . the ti l - edge spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) was obtained by integrating the photoemission intensity in the boxed regions shown in the xpeem images in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](b)-(c ) for each measured photon energy .",
    "we are thus able to extract the xas spectrum from a specific area on the sample .",
    "the ti l - edge shows the characteristic doublet of peaks arising from the crystal field splitting in tio@xmath1 . within each doublet",
    "we identify the so - called @xmath17 and @xmath18 peaks , which correspond to the @xmath19- and @xmath20-states formed by the ti 3d and o 2p orbitals , respectively @xcite .",
    "we find an overall reduction of intensity within the ti l - edge on the ws@xmath1 part due to absorption of secondary electrons in the ws@xmath1 crystal .",
    "this gives rise to a significant contrast difference between tio@xmath1 and ws@xmath1 as seen in the comparison between the images obtained in the pre - edge region and at the @xmath17 peak energy in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](b)-(c ) .",
    "the ratio between the @xmath21 and @xmath17 peaks is nearly identical on the bare tio@xmath1 substrate and on the ws@xmath1 part .",
    "this implies that the @xmath20-interaction is uniform across bare tio@xmath1 and under the ws@xmath1 @xcite , such that the annealing- and beam - induced- oxygen vacancy density is similar in the two parts of the sample and there is no apparent chemical interaction between tio@xmath1 and ws@xmath1 .",

    "the spectra were acquired using an energy filtering entrance slit and by projecting the back focal plane onto the detector .",

    "the w 4f and s 2p binding energy regions in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](e)-(f ) were measured in the interior part of the ws@xmath1 crystal .",
    "for both the w 4f and s 2p regions we observe the expected peaks and no additional components due to _ e.g. _ tungsten - oxides remaining from the cvd synthesis @xcite , or due to an interaction with oxygen in the tio@xmath1 substrate .",
    "the ti 2p spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](f ) was recorded with the aperture on the bare tio@xmath1 substrate .",
    "a total of four peaks is used to fit the spectrum to take into account the coexistence of both ti@xmath22 and ti@xmath23 charge states .",
    "the latter appears due to oxygen vacancies , which have formed during the initial annealing of the sample and the continuous exposure to the synchrotron beam .    the ws@xmath1/tio@xmath1 valence band ( vb ) region is investigated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "we measure the electronic band structure using xpeem with a photon energy of 45  ev and a fov of 15  @xmath5 m on the sample , as described for the xps measurements above . a spectrum measured in the interior part of the ws@xmath1 crystal along the @xmath24 symmetry direction of the ws@xmath1 bz",

    "[ fig:3](a ) .",
    "we identify the characteristic vb of sl ws@xmath1 with the global vbm situated at @xmath3 and not at @xmath25 as in multilayer ws@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "the remainder of the dispersing bands all derive from the w 5d and s 3p states that make up the vb of ws@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we do not observe any changes in the band structure such as hybridization or broadening effects as the ws@xmath1 bands cross into the tio@xmath1 vb continuum around a binding energy of 2.5  ev .",
    "this is most clearly seen _ via _ the excellent agreement between the calculated bands of free - standing sl ws@xmath1 shown as the white dashed lines in fig . [ fig:3](a ) and the measured band structure .    in order to determine how the vb of ws@xmath1 varies spatially we measure an energy- and momentum - filtered image in real space , which corresponds to the dark field imaging mode of xpeem @xcite . in the dark field image in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) we restrict the measured electrons to originate from the local vbm at @xmath25 in ws@xmath1 using a contrast aperture ( see circled region in figs .",

    ". however , the line scan of the dark field intensity in fig . [ fig:3](c ) reveals a decrease in vb intensity around the edge of the ws@xmath1 crystal .",
    "this behavior is studied in detail _ via _ the dispersion plots along the @xmath26 direction of the ws@xmath1 bz in figs . [ fig:3](d)-(g ) and the energy distribution curves ( edcs ) binned @xmath27  @xmath28 around the @xmath25-point in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](h ) .",

    "[ fig:3](b ) .",
    "we observe that the bare tio@xmath1 electronic structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3](d ) ) with oxygen 2p bands peaking around binding energies of 6  ev and 4  ev coexist with ws@xmath1 vb features in regions 2 and 3 near the edge of the flake ( see edcs 1 - 3 in fig . [",
    "fig:3](h ) ) .",
    "this is expected for the edge region probed in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](e ) since both bare tio@xmath1 and ws@xmath1 is included in the measured fov . since the o 2p bands of tio@xmath1 are not completely attenuated by the ws@xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](f ) and edc 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](h ) the ws@xmath1 flake must contain nano - sized pinholes , which could have been etched like the larger triangular holes seen in fig . [",
    "fig:1](g ) .",
    "note that in the interior of the flake where edc 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](h ) was acquired we exclusively observe peaks that correspond to the w 5d and s 3p states seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) .",
    "small , rigid binding energy shifts on the order of 100  mev are observed between the ws@xmath1 related peaks in edc 2 - 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](h ) , which implies a spatial doping profile .",
    "this is likely caused by remaining polymer residue from the transfer process @xcite .",
    "additionally , changes are known to occur in the structural and chemical composition around the edge of triangular synthetic 2d tmdcs , as the luminescence signal modulates strongly within a range of 0.5 - 5  @xmath5 m from the edge @xcite .",
    "the analysis in figs . [ fig:3](e)-(h ) reveals that the ws@xmath1 related band structure in the edge region of our transferred flake has similar dispersion and line widths as the band structure measured in the interior part .",
    "for example , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the lorentzian line shape fitted to the top - most vb state remains on the order of 550  mev through edcs 2 - 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](h ) .",
    "thus , the actual band structure does not seem to vary strongly from the edge to the interior of the flake , at least not on the length scale probed here .    [ t ! ]",
    "we have performed high resolution arpes measurements with a hemispherical electron analyzer in order to extract the effective masses and spin - orbit induced splitting of the sl ws@xmath1 flake .",
    "these measurements have significantly higher energy and angular resolution ( @xmath29  mev and @xmath30 ) but significantly worse spatial resolution ( @xmath31  @xmath5 m ) than the measurements discussed above that were acquired using xpeem .    well - defined pockets of intensity at @xmath25 and @xmath32 are seen in the constant energy surfaces across several bzs of the sl ws@xmath1 in the arpes data in fig . [",

    "cuts of the dispersion along the high symmetry directions spanning two bzs are shown in figs . [ fig:4](b)-(c ) .",
    "the dispersive features are fully consistent with those observed by xpeem in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) and are attributed to the vb states of sl ws@xmath1 .",
    "the intensity of the bands varies strongly across the bz and the top of the vb at @xmath3 seems to vanish .",
    "this modulation of intensity is a matrix element effect that originates from the change of the w 5d orbital character of the bands from out - of - plane orbitals at @xmath25 to in - plane orbitals at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we find that once we change the photon energy from the 90  ev used in figs .",
    "[ fig:4](a)-(c ) to 30  ev we are able to resolve the vbm at @xmath3 along with the spin split states along the @xmath24 direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](d ) .",
    "note that the broad line widths observed in the bands in figs .",
    "[ fig:4](b)-(d ) are partly attributable to averaging over areas with slightly different doping , which were observed with xpeem in fig .",

    "a single lorentzian line shape describes the vb around @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4](e ) ) , which has a maximum at a binding energy of 1.43  ev .",
    "the fit leads us to estimate an effective mass given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the free electron mass . at @xmath3",
    "we use two lorentzian functions to describe the spin - split bands and use the energy difference between the fitted peaks as an estimate of the spin - orbit splitting @xmath36 ( see fig . [ fig:4](f ) ) .",
    "we obtain a maximum value given by @xmath37  mev , which diminishes as the band disperses towards @xmath25 .",
    "the global vbm is found at a binding energy of 1.17  ev .",
    "this places the fermi level below the middle of the band gap of the material if we assume a quasiparticle gap on the order of 2.9  ev as predicted for sl ws@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , since this gap can be strongly renormalized due to screening from the high-@xmath0 substrate @xcite , the actual doping of the ws@xmath1 can not be determined from these measurements .",
    "we estimate the effective masses of the spin - split bands from the fits and obtain @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the value of @xmath36 , the observation of the global vbm at @xmath3 , and the effective masses are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for free - standing sl ws@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "[ fig:5](d ) .",
    "the fwhm of the fitted lorentzian peak of the top - most vb state is 33  % larger in the srtio@xmath2 case .",
    "the presence of both tio@xmath1 and sro terminations causes a more inhomogeneous interface between sl ws@xmath1 and srtio@xmath2 , which could give rise to scattering and thereby broadening of the measured linewidth .",
    "furthermore , we observe a substantial rigid shift of the vb of 0.43  ev to higher binding energies in the srtio@xmath2 case , which is likely related to different pinning of the fermi level in the two substrates .",
    "in summary , we have interfaced sl ws@xmath1 with the transition metal oxide substrate rutile tio@xmath1(100 ) and observe _ via _ xpeem and arpes measurements of the electronic structure that the substrate has a very minor influence on the sl ws@xmath1 vb , which strongly resembles the vb of a freestanding layer .",
    "previous arpes studies have focused on epitaxial sl ws@xmath1 grown on graphite @xcite or on metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "the top - most vb of sl ws@xmath1 did not exhibit any interaction with the graphite substrate @xcite , but for sl ws@xmath1 grown on au(111 ) strong hybridization effects were observed between the vb at @xmath25 and the bulk metal bands @xcite . the out - of - plane w 5d and s 3p orbitals that constitute the vb at @xmath25 are particularly sensitive towards the environment . in our case",

    "we have shown that sl ws@xmath1 transferred on the more complex oxide srtio@xmath2 is characterized by broader electronic states , which may be related to sro and tio@xmath1 segregation at ws@xmath1-srtio@xmath2 interface .",
    "furthermore , a large shift of the sl ws@xmath1 vb of 0.43  ev on srtio@xmath2 compared to tio@xmath1 shows that the choice of substrate strongly influences the band positions in sl tmdcs .",
    "our results imply that the transfer of sl tmdcs on transition metal oxide substrates offers an alternative method for engineering the properties of 2d semiconductors , for example by interfacing the 2d materials with different high-@xmath0 materials and thereby introducing a means to control the screening and band alignments in such systems .",

    "<S> there is a substantial interest in the heterostructures of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) amongst each other or with arbitrary materials , through which the control of the chemical , structural , electronic , spintronic , and optical properties can lead to a change in device paradigms . </S>",
    "<S> a critical need is to understand the interface between tmdcs and insulating substrates , for example high-@xmath0 dielectrics , which can strongly impact the electronic properties such as the optical gap . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the chemical and electronic properties of the single - layer ( sl ) tmdc , ws@xmath1 , can be transferred onto high-@xmath0 transition metal oxide substrates tio@xmath1 and srtio@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting samples are much more suitable for measuring their electronic and chemical structures with angle - resolved photoemission than their native - grown sio@xmath1 substrates . </S>",
    "<S> we probe the ws@xmath1 on the micron scale across 100-micron flakes , and find that the occupied electronic structure is exactly as predicted for freestanding sl ws@xmath1 with a strong spin - orbit splitting of 420  mev and a direct band gap at the valence band maximum . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that tmdcs can be combined with arbitrary multi - functional oxides , which may introduce alternative means of controlling the optoelectronic properties of such materials . </S>",
    "<S> +   + keywords : spatially - resolved photoemission , peem , arpes , transition metal dichalcogenides , ws@xmath1 , high-@xmath0 oxides .    the isolation of single - layer ( sl ) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs)@xcite has enabled truly two - dimensional ( 2d ) transistors and optoelectronic devices @xcite , as well as artificial heterostructures with interesting physical properties @xcite . among this family of tmdcs , which encompasses the 2h - polytypes of the four materials mos@xmath1 , mose@xmath1 , ws@xmath1 and wse@xmath1 , the electronic properties of sl ws@xmath1 are considered the most promising due to a combination of particularly strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite , a small effective mass of the upper valence band maximum ( vbm ) @xcite and a relatively high mobility limited by electron - phonon coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , luminescence measurements of the pronounced a and b excitons indicate that ws@xmath1 transforms into a direct gap semiconductor in the sl limit with the position of its vbm shifting to the @xmath3-point in the corner of the brillouin zone ( bz ) of the material @xcite , similarly as for mos@xmath1 , mose@xmath1 and wse@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , sl ws@xmath1 supports strong light - matter interactions that lead to improved light absorption compared to standard photovoltaic devices @xcite and exotic many - body effects such as dark excitons @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic properties of sl tmdcs are known to be extremely sensitive towards the properties of the supporting substrate or contact materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the dielectric screening by the substrate @xcite and the number of free carriers induced either _ via _ electrical or optical doping @xcite the quasiparticle band gap and the exciton binding energies can be strongly renormalized , effectively changing the optoelectronic properties of the material . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the structural properties of the sl tmdcs can have an important impact on their electronic structure , for example , _ via _ strain induced changes of the band structure @xcite or by enhancing the interaction with the substrate by introducing an interlayer twist angle @xcite . in the case of sl ws@xmath1 , it is possible to synthesize single crystal flakes reaching dimensions on the order of @xmath4100  @xmath5 m using chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) growth techniques , involving molecular growth promoters and standard weakly interacting substrates such as sio@xmath1/si @xcite . since such flakes are routinely picked up from sio@xmath1 for transfer to other substrates @xcite , one can freely choose the type of interface for the 2d material and thereby investigate its properties in a wide variety of device or substrate environments .    given the interplay of the effects on the electronic properties mentioned above and the potential of assembling diverse sample - substrate systems , direct methods that can spatially resolve the electronic structure of the sl tmdcs are needed , in addition to the available luminescence measurements . </S>",
    "<S> so far the thickness - dependent electronic structures of exfoliated mos@xmath1 and wse@xmath1 on sio@xmath1 have been investigated with spatially - resolved angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite . in these studies , </S>",
    "<S> both the low energy electron diffraction spots and angle - dependent photoemission features were significantly broadened for sl compared to thicker films . </S>",
    "<S> this is caused by the mechanical compliance of the sl films , which conform to the known rough surface of sio@xmath1 @xcite , spoiling the momentum resolution of electron scattering and emission probes . </S>",
    "<S> low energy electronic parameters such as effective mass and spin - orbit splitting are therefore not reliably quantifiable from samples on such substrates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a secondary motivation of our work is to find sufficiently flat substrates so that the arpes technique can be applied without loss of momentum resolution , in order to access the true low - energy excitations .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been theoretically predicted that by encapsulating sl tmdcs in high-@xmath0 dielectric materials such as hfo@xmath1 in a transistor configuration , the enhanced dielectric screening can lead to renormalization of the electron - hole interaction and the band gap in the materials @xcite , in addition to enhanced screening of charged coulomb impurities and thereby a reduction of the overall carrier scattering rate @xcite . in order to directly study the effect of high-@xmath0 support materials on the electronic structure of sl ws@xmath1 with photoemission </S>",
    "<S> , we utilize the transition metal oxides tio@xmath1 and srtio@xmath2 as model systems . </S>",
    "<S> we focus our study on sl ws@xmath1 transferred on rutile tio@xmath1(100 ) , which is one of the more simple and stable transition metal oxide surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> it has a wide band gap of 3.0 ev and a dielectric constant given by @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we compare to the case of srtio@xmath2(100 ) where @xmath7 at room temperature and where both tio@xmath1 and sro surface terminations are possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we endeavor to determine the electronic structure of these systems using the spatially resolved photoemission techniques x - ray photoemission electron microscopy ( xpeem ) and arpes with the synchrotron beam focused on the order of 30 - 50  @xmath5 m . </S>",
    "<S> the tio@xmath1 and srtio@xmath2 substrates have a smooth surface , which is needed in arpes experiments where a well - defined surface normal vector is a basic requirement to preserve the angular resolution . finally , by combining 2d and bulk semiconductors it is possible to increase the efficiency of photocatalytic devices @xcite and to control the separation of charge carriers _ via _ engineered band offsets @xcite . </S>"
