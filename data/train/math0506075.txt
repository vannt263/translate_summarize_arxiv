    "hidden in the background of the babson and kozlov proof of lov ' asz conjecture @xcite @xcite are interesting topological and combinatorial concepts and structures associated to graphs and graph homomorphisms .",
    "the proof itself runs in two phases , each phase divided in several steps , often involving a detailed case analysis . for this reason the underlying secondary structures may not be visible or immediately recognized under the layers of intricate technical details .",
    "recall that the crux of babson and kozlov approach is a skilful and technically quite involved application of spectral sequences .",
    "one of the classical applications of this method is to the ( co)homology of fibered spaces which by the nature are spaces which alow some form of transport from one fibre to another .    in this paper",
    "we focus on one of these secondary structures which can be , somewhat informally , described as the `` parallel transport '' of graph complexes over graphs .",
    "the introduction of this structure and recognition of its role leads to a great simplification of the proof of lov ' asz conjecture in some cases .",
    "another of its features , aside from offering a conceptual `` explanation '' for the success of one of the technical approaches of babson and kozlov , is its potential for generating other statements of this type .",
    "the `` parallel transport '' of graph complexes introduced here seems to be a novel concept .",
    "however the groupoids ( groups of projectivities ) used in its definition have already appeared in geometric combinatorics in the work of m.  joswig @xcite , see also @xcite @xcite @xcite , where they have been applied to toric manifolds , branched coverings over @xmath1 , colorings of simple polytopes etc .",
    "it is an exciting `` coincidence '' that there have been other recent developments in geometric and algebraic combinatorics where groupoids and associated objects and constructions were _",
    "implicitly _ used , @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "these are not isolated examples of course .",
    "in particular one should be fully aware of a rich and deep combinatorics already present in numerous categorical constructions related to groupoids and their applications in geometry and mathematical physics .",
    "one of central themes in topological combinatorics , after the landmark paper of laszlo lov ' asz @xcite where he proved the classical kneser conjecture , has been the study and applications of graph complexes .",
    "the underlying theme is to explore how the topological complexity of a graph complex @xmath2 reflects in the combinatorial complexity of the graph @xmath3 itself .",
    "the results one is usually interested in come in the form of inequalities @xmath4 , or equivalently in the form of implications @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a topological invariant of @xmath2 , while @xmath7 is a combinatorial invariant of the graph @xmath3 .    the most interesting candidate for the invariant",
    "@xmath8 has been the chromatic number @xmath9 of @xmath3 , while the role of the invariant @xmath10 was played by the `` connectedness '' of @xmath2 , its equivariant index , the height of an associated characteristic cohomology class etc .",
    ", see @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite for recent accounts .    the famous result of lov ' asz quoted above is today usually formulated in the form of an implication @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the so called `` box complex '' of @xmath3 .",
    "the box complex is a special case of a general graph complex @xmath13 ( also introduced by l.  lov ' asz ) , a cell complex which functorially depends on the input graphs @xmath14 and @xmath3 .    an outstanding conjecture in this area , refereed to as `` lov ' asz conjecture '' , was that one obtains a better bound if the graph @xmath15 in ( 1 ) is replaced by an odd cycle @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely lov ' asz conjectured that @xmath17 this conjecture was confirmed by babson and kozlov in @xcite , see also @xcite for a more detailed exposition .",
    "our objective is to develop methods which both offer a simplified approach to the proof of implication ( [ eq : lovasz - conj ] ) , at least in the case when @xmath18 is odd , and providing new insight , open a possibility of proving similar results for other classes of ( hyper)graphs and simplicial complexes .",
    "an example of such a result is theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "one of its corollaries is the following implication , @xmath19 which , under a suitable assumption on the complex @xmath20 and the assumption that integer @xmath18 is odd , extends ( [ eq : lovasz - conj ] ) to the case of pure @xmath21-dimensional simplicial complexes .",
    "in order to avoid any ambiguities , we briefly clarify what is in this paper meant by a `` parallel transport '' on a `` bundle '' of spaces .",
    "a `` bundle '' is a map @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 is a set and that @xmath24 is a topological space , so a bundle is just a collection of spaces ( fibres ) @xmath25 parameterized by @xmath23 .",
    "if all spaces @xmath25 are homeomorphic to a fixed `` model '' space , this space is referred to as the fiber of the bundle @xmath26 .",
    "suppose that @xmath27 is a groupoid on @xmath23 as the set of objects .",
    "in other words @xmath28 is a small category where @xmath29 , such that all morphisms @xmath30 are invertible .",
    "a `` connection '' or `` parallel transport '' on the bundle @xmath31 is a functor @xmath32 such @xmath33 for each @xmath34 .    informally speaking",
    ", the groupoid @xmath27 provides a `` road map '' on @xmath23 , while the functor @xmath35 defines the associated transport from one fibre to another .",
    "sometimes it is convenient to view the bundle @xmath31 as a map @xmath36 .",
    "then to define a `` connection '' on this bundle is equivalent to enriching the map @xmath37 to a functor @xmath38 .",
    "suppose that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are finite simplicial complexes and let @xmath18 be an integer such that @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the set of all @xmath18-dimensional simplices in @xmath39 .",
    "define a bundle @xmath43 by the formula @xmath44 where @xmath45 is one of the @xmath0-complexes introduced in section  [ sec : hom ] and @xmath46 is the complex well known in topological combinatorics as the deleted product of @xmath40 , @xcite chapter  6 .",
    "a typical cell in @xmath46 is of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a collection of non - empty simplices in @xmath40 such that if @xmath49 then @xmath50 . the corresponding cell in @xmath45 is a function @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the set of all vertices of @xmath53 , and if @xmath54 then @xmath55 .",

    "in other words , @xmath60 is a spherical bundle naturally associated to the simplicial complex @xmath39 .",
    "our next goal , in the spirit of section  [ sec : generalities ] , is to identify a groupoid on the set @xmath61 which acts on the bundle @xmath62 , i.e.  a groupoid which provides a parallel transport of fibres of the bundle @xmath62 .",
    "it is a pleasant coincidence that this groupoid has already appeared in geometric combinatorics @xcite @xcite .",
    "indeed , the _ groups of projectivities _ m.  joswig introduced and studied in these papers are just the _ vertex _ or _ isotropy _ groups of a groupoid which we call the @xmath18-th _ groupoid of projectivities _ of @xmath39 and denote by @xmath63 . in these and in subsequent papers @xcite @xcite @xcite , the groups of projectivities found interesting applications to toric manifolds , branched coverings over @xmath1 , colorings of simple polytopes , etc . here is a summary of this construction .    two @xmath18-dimensional simplices @xmath64 and",

    "a _ projectivity _ between two , not necessarily adjacent , simplices @xmath64 and @xmath72 is a composition of perspectivities @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a path of @xmath18-dimensional simplices in @xmath39 such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 share a common @xmath66-dimensional face @xmath77 .    * caveat : * here we adopt a useful convention that @xmath78 for each two composable maps @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "the main motivation for introducing the parallel transport of @xmath0-complexes is the lovsz conjecture and its ramifications .",
    "this is the reason why the case of graphs and the graph complexes deserves a special attention .",
    "additional justification for emphasizing graphs comes from the fact that graph complexes @xmath104 have been studied in numerous papers and today form a well established part of graph theory and topological combinatorics .",
    "the situation with simplicial complexes is quite the opposite . in order to extend the theory of @xmath0-complexes from graphs to the category of simplicial complexes , many concepts should be generalized and the corresponding facts established in a more general setting .",
