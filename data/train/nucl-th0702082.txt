    "the first five years of rhic operations at @xmath0  gev and @xmath1  gev have yielded a vast amount of interesting and sometimes surprising results .",
    "there exists mounting evidence that rhic has created a hot and dense state of deconfined qcd matter with properties similar to that of an ideal fluid @xcite  this state of matter has been termed the _ strongly interacting quark - gluon - plasma _ ( sqgp ) .",
    "one of the evidence is the success of ideal hydrodynamic models in various physical observables .",
    "especially , for the first time , in elliptic flow the hydrodynamic limit shows good agreement with the experimental data at rhic , though at ags and sps hydrodynamic models give larger value as compared to experimental data .",
    "the sophisticated 3d ideal hydrodynamic calculations , however , reveal that many of experimental data have not yet been fully evaluated or understood @xcite .",
    "for example , elliptic flow at forward and backward rapidity at forward / backward rapidity by using event - by - event fluctuated initial conditions @xcite . ] and at peripheral collisions is overestimated by ideal hydrodynamical models .",
    "the hanbury - brown twiss ( hbt ) puzzle is not completely understood from the point of view of hydrodynamics .",
    "these distinctions between hydrodynamic calculation and experimental data suggest that the ideal hydrodynamic picture is not applicable to all physical observables even in low transverse momentum region . at present our main interest in hydrodynamic models",
    "is the following : _ how perfect the sqgp is ? _    here , first , we shall give a short review of hydrodynamic models at heavy ion collisions .",
    "in addition to a numerical procedure for solving the relativistic hydrodynamic equation , hydrodynamic models are characterized by initial conditions , eoss and freezeout process .",
    "the necessity of input of initial conditions for hydrodynamic models is one of the largest limitations of them .",
    "because an initial condition is not be able to determined in the framework of hydrodynamic model itself , usually a parametrization of energy density and baryon number density based on glauber type is used and parameters in it are determined by comparison with experimental data @xcite .",
    "recently there are some studies in which more basic approaches , color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite , pqcd + saturation model @xcite are used for construction of initial conditions .",
    "the most important advantage of hydrodynamic models is that it directly incorporates an eos as input and thus is so far the only dynamical model in which a phase transition can explicitly be incorporated . in the ideal fluid approximation  and once an initial condition has been specified ",
    "the eos is the _ only _ input to the equations of motion and relates directly to properties of the matter under consideration . in this sense",
    "a hydrodynamic model is a bridge between qcd theory and experimental data and indispensable to describe heavy ion physics .",
    "however in usual practical hydrodynamic simulations , an eos with 1st order phase transition ( bag model ) is used .",
    "in fact , there are few studies on effect of order of qcd phase transition on physical observables @xcite .",
    "conventional hydrodynamic calculations need to assume a _ freezeout _ temperature at which the hydrodynamic evolution is terminated and a transition from the zero mean - free - path approximation of a hydrodynamic approach to the infinite mean - free - path of free streaming particles takes place .",
    "the freezeout temperature usually is a free parameter which can be fitted to measured hadron spectra .",
    "there are several approaches for dealing with freezeout process : chemical equilibrium @xcite , partial chemical equilibrium @xcite , continuous emission model @xcite and construction of a hybrid model of a hydro + cascade model @xcite .    in tab .",
    "[ tab - hydro ] several hydrodynamic models are listed from the viewpoint of initial conditions and freezeout processes , because almost the same eos with strong 1st order phase transition is used .",
    "reference @xcite presents the first calculation which shows the remarkable agreement with experimental data for both of @xmath2 spectra and @xmath3 at rhic .",
    "however it turns out that the assumption of single freezeout temperature where chemical freezeout and kinetic freezeout occur at the same time fails in reproducing hadron ratios correctly . to obtain correct proton @xmath2 spectra",
    ", we need to renormalize the @xmath2 spectra using the @xmath4 to @xmath5 ratio at the critical temperature .",
    "in addition , recently , hirano and gyullasy point out that the good agreement of elliptic flow with experimental data may accidentally happen .",
    "hirano and kolb et al .",
    "propose that the introduction of two kinds of freezeout processes , chemical freezeout and kinetic freezeout to hydrodynamic models .",
    "in this model , normalization of the @xmath2 spectra for each particle are obtained correctly @xcite , but to get better agreement with experiments in elliptic flow additional initial transverse flow is needed .",
    "at present , the combination of gluaber type and a cascade model gives us the most promising result for both of @xmath2 spectra and @xmath3 .",
    "hirano et al .",
    "perform calculations using cgc for initial condition and a cascade model for freezeout process , which suggests that viscosity is not negligible even at early stage of the expansion . in the next section",

    "we calculate hadron distribution at switching temperature from the 3d hydrodynamic model using cooper - frye formula @xcite and produce initial conditions for urqmd model by monte carlo from it .",
    "such hybrid macro / micro transport calculations are to date the most successful approaches for describing the soft physics at rhic .",
    "the biggest advantage of the hydrodynamic description is that it directly incorporates an eos as input - one of its largest limitations is that it requires thermalized initial conditions and one is not able to do an ab - initio calculation .",

    "the most compelling feature is that the hydro+micro approach is capable of accounting for the proper normalization of the spectra for all hadron species without any additional correction as is performed in the pure hydrodynamic model .",

    "there is no distinct difference between 3-d ideal hydrodynamic model and the hydro + urqmd model in the centrality dependence of the psuedorapidity distribution , indicating that the shape of psuedorapidity distribution is insensitive to the detailed microscopic reaction dynamics of the hadronic final state @xcite .    in fig .",

    "recent experimental results suggest that at thermal freezeout multistrange baryons exhibit less transverse flow and a higher temperature closer to the chemical freezeout temperature compared to non- or single - strange baryons @xcite . this behavior can be understood in terms of the flavor dependence of the hadronic cross section , which decreases with increasing strangeness content of the hadron .",
    "the reduced cross section of multi - strange baryons leads to a decoupling from the hadronic medium at an earlier stage of the reaction , allowing them to provide information on the properties of the hadronizing qgp less distorted by hadronic final state interactions     spectra of multi - strange particles at centralities 05 % and 1020 % with star data @xcite . ]",

    "the solid line stands for the pure hydro calculation , terminated at the switching temperature @xmath15 and solid circles denote the full hydro+micro calculation .",
    "we find that the qgp contribution to the elliptic flow depends on the transverse momentum  for low @xmath2 nearly 100% of the elliptic flow is created in the qgp phase of the reaction , whereas the hadronic phase contribution increases to 25% at a @xmath2 of 1  gev/@xmath16 .",

    "the shape of the elliptic flow in the pure hydrodynamic calculation at @xmath15 is quite different from that of the full hydrodynamic one terminated at a freeze - out temperature of 110  mev .",
    "apparently the slight bump at forward and backward rapidities observed in the full hydrodynamic calculation develops first in the later hadronic phase , since it is not observed in the calculation terminated at @xmath15 .",

    "becuase in hydrodynamic calculations , however , outputs may also be changed easily by choice of initial conditions and freezeout process , which makes it difficult to obtain the conclusive discussion on the eos .",
