    "during attachment to a substrate , most cell types actively sense the adhesive geometry and stiffness of their environment by generating contractile forces in their actin cytoskeleton that are transmitted to the substrate through cell - matrix contacts @xcite .",
    "the resulting traction force then feeds back into biochemical circuits of the cell by a large range of different mechanosensitive processes , with dramatic consequences for cell polarization , migration , proliferation , differentiation , and fate @xcite . to understand these essential processes , it is therefore very important to measure or predict the cellular forces .",
    "one of the biggest challenges in cell experiments is the inherent variability in their organization , including shape and traction forces .",
    "cells on a homogeneously adhesive substrate display a large variety of shapes , and even cells with similar shapes usually differ in their internal organization . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "micropatterned substrates have emerged as a very useful tool to standardize cell experiments @xcite . in a pioneering study using microcontact printing",
    ", it has been shown that cell survival depends also on the spatial extension of the pattern and not only on the amount of ligand it contains @xcite .",
    "many subsequent studies then used micropatterns to show that many essential cellular functions depend on shape , including the distribution of stress fibers @xcite , the orientation of the mitotic spindle @xcite or endomembrane organization @xcite .",
    "cellular sensing of micropattern geometry is closely related to stiffness sensing , as both depend on cellular forces being developed in the actin cytoskeleton . to measure cellular forces on flat elastic substrates , different variants of traction force microscopy",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "this approach is now increasingly combined with micropatterning of cell shape , for example , by using microcontact printing @xcite or deep - ultraviolet illumination of polyacrylamide substrates @xcite or lift - off techniques on silicone rubber substrates @xcite .",
    "micropatterning of cell shape is naturally complemented by quantitative image processing and modeling .",
    "several types of mathematical model have been developed to predict cell shape on micropatterns @xcite .",
    "the simplest type is a contour model .",
    "the simplest type is a contour model .",
    "it has been suggested , based on observations of circular arc features of cells adhering to homogeneous substrates , that laplace - type models arise from the competition of tension in the periphery ( geometrically a line tension ) and tension in the cell body ( geometrically a surface tension ) @xcite .",
    "here , we call this approach the simple tension model ( stm )",
    ". a quantitative analysis of cell shape on dot patterns has shown that in the presence of strong contour reinforcement by peripheral actin bundles , the stm has to be modified by elastic elements , leading to the tension - elasticity model ( tem ) @xcite .",
    "both stm and tem describe not only cell shape but also cell forces @xcite .",
    "it was shown recently that the tem emerges as a good approximation to a bulk model for contractile cells if the tension in the periphery dominates the bulk tension @xcite .",
    "the natural starting point for a bulk model of cell shape is continuum mechanics , which can be implemented with the finite - element method ( fem ) . to represent contractility in such a framework",
    ", one can use isotropic thermoelasticity , which represents contractility by a negative pressure in the elastic equations , as it can be induced in passive materials by lowering temperature .",
    "this approach is commonly used for model contraction in cell monolayers @xcite .",
    "recently also , such an isotropic thermoelastic model was used to predict the shape and forces of cells on micropatterns @xcite . to represent the anisotropic effect of stress fibers ,",
    "the isotropic thermoelastic approach has been extended by an orientation - dependent order - parameter field for contractility @xcite .",
    "the strength of a stress fiber is determined by a positive - feedback mechanism regarding how much force can be built up in a given direction , favoring directions of large effective stiffness .",
    "cell shapes and forces then can be predicted if the attachment sites are known , for example , for micropatterns @xcite and pillar arrays @xcite .",
    "fem - based models for cell shape usually assume linear elastic or hyperelastic material laws for the mechanical properties of cells .",
    "indeed , this is often a good assumption , for example , on the large scale of tissues or for single cells with conserved volume .",
    "however , for cells adhering to a substrate , the projected area is not a conserved quantity , and volume can be exchanged with the third dimension . in this case , the mechanical response is mainly determined by the actin cytoskeleton , which behaves like an elastic solid under extension but does not resist compression because actin filaments under compression can buckle , depolymerize , and slide . when modeling cells on an intermediate length scale , this fundamental asymmetry between tension and compression can be represented by cable networks @xcite .",
    "if actomyosin contractility is represented not by a reduced resting length , but rather by a constant pull between neighboring nodes , one arrives at the model of actively contracting cable networks @xcite .",
    "because contractile tension dominates in the bulk and passive elastic tension in the periphery , the corresponding computer simulations are described well by the analytical predictions of the tem , both for actively contracting cable networks @xcite and thermoelastic continuum models @xcite .",
    "all of the above models are relatively static in nature and assume that the general features of cell shape ( in particular , pinning points to the substrate ) are already known . here , we aim to develop a model that predicts the dynamics of cell shape and traction forces on micropatterned substrates without any a priori assumptions regarding the final shape .",
    "two types of model in particular seem to qualify for this purpose . phase - field models ( also known as levelset methods ) have recently been used to predict cell shape in the context of cell migration , because they are particularly suited to represent propagating contours @xcite . to represent contractility",
    ", however , cellular potts models ( cpms ) seem to be more appropriate .",
    "cpms are latticebased and represent a cell by a collection of spins ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : cell_cartoon ] _ a _ ) , thus allowing for arbitrary cell shapes . by defining an energy functional on the spin configuration and exploiting the slow timescale for cell spreading , one can use metropolis dynamics to propagate the system .",
    "cpms are commonly used to model tissues , as reviewed in anderson and rejniak @xcite .",
    "one prominent application is the study of cell sorting by the differential adhesion hypothesis @xcite . besides their applicability to tissue , cpms",
    "have also been used in systems consisting of only a few cells @xcite . recently ,",
    "however , a cpm was applied also to predict the shape of single cells on micropatterned substrates @xcite . moreover ,",
    "single - keratocyte movement has been modeled with a cpm by coupling metropolis dynamics to a model for actin polymerization @xcite .    as in the case of the ising model ,",
    "the shapes predicted by the cpm are dominated by interfacial tension .",
    "his generates a close relation not only to contour models , but also to vertex models .",
    "however , the latter are not lattice - based but rather define energy functionals for cell shapes with straight or circular contours ( that is , for the solutions of the laplace law ) .",
    "they have been used , for example , to explore the role of mechanical interactions for growth of the drosophila wing imaginal disk @xcite or to investigate the influence of cell elasticity , cell - cell interaction , and cell proliferation on cell sheet - packing geometry @xcite .",
    "however , vertex models can not be used to model single cells on micropatterns because they can not account for arbitrary shapes .    to arrive at a flexible and dynamic modeling framework for cell shape and forces , here we choose to work with a cpm . to predict not only shape , but also traction forces of adhering cells",
    ", the cpm has to be modified in several regards . for this purpose",
    ", we use insights from the tem to derive an energy functional for single cells on micropatterned substrates .",
    "the energy functional is based on the different kinds of tension acting in the cell , which are balanced by the adhesive substrate and manifest as traction force . from our predicted cell shapes",
    ", we can extract the traction force for any adhesive geometry in a very efficient manner and in good agreement with experimental results .",
    "single cells on flat micropatterned substrates are effectively two - dimensional and often form invaginated circular arcs along free edges @xcite .",
    "the circular shape can be understood in context of a laplace law , where a surface tension @xmath0 , which draws the contour inwards , is balanced by a line tension @xmath1 , which wants to draw the contour straight @xcite .",
    "the surface tension results from the combined action of the plasma membrane wrapped around the cell body and the actin cortex underlying it @xcite .",
    "in particular , the actin cortex is contracted by myosin ii minifilaments .",
    "the line tension reflects the fact that the plasma membrane and actin cortex are folded back onto themselves at the cell periphery and thus lead to a geometrically different contribution than in the bulk .",
    "moreover , it reflects the fact that actin filament bundles tend to accumulate in these folded parts at the cell edge .",
    "the appearance of circular arcs is not restricted to cells on a dot pattern ; it also occurs on concave parts of the micropatterned island @xcite , as depicted for the crossbow shape in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell_cartoon ] _",
    "b_. here , the surface tension @xmath0 pulls the contour inwards , while the line tension @xmath1 pulls the contour outwards .",
    "this is different at the convex parts , where both surface tension and line tension pull inwards .",
    "this pull is balanced by the adhesion sites along the cell contour .",
    "because the cell periphery is less reinforced by actin bundles along the convex parts , the line tension there is expected to be weaker .",

    "the anchoring points of the contour are indicated by @xmath4 and @xmath5 with tangents @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the normals @xmath8 and @xmath9 point to the center of the circular arc with radius @xmath10.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the simplest model for the situation depicted in fig .",

    "a correlation of the arc radius @xmath10 and the spanning distance @xmath2 between two adhesive islands was observed which can be understood in terms of the tension elasticity model ( tem ) @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the reinforced actin edge fibers forming at the free spanning edges contribute with an elastic line tension @xmath13 , where the one - dimensional elastic modulus @xmath14 accounts for the rigidity of the contour and @xmath3 and @xmath15 are the contour length and rest length , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cell_cartoon ] _ b _ ) . pinned parts of the contour are not reinforced and we assume only the simple tension @xmath11 acting there . for the free arcs one then has the overall line tension @xmath16 . like the stm",
    ", the tem also leads to a laplace law . combining this with the elastic line tension and the geometrical relation between arc radius @xmath10 and spanning distance @xmath2",
    ", one finds a self - consistent equation for @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a length scale defined by the relative weight of the one - dimensional elastic modulus and the surface tension .",
    "therefore circular arcs also arise in the tem , but with a radius @xmath10 that increases with spanning distance @xmath2 and with contour reinforcement @xmath20 @xcite .    like these contour models , the cellular potts model ( cpm ) also centers around the concept of geometrical tension , but allows for much more variable geometries .",
    "our cpm implementation uses a two - dimensional square lattice where the cell is represented by occupied lattice sites , compare fig .",
    "[ fig : cell_cartoon ] _ a_. the adhesive pattern is realized by marking the corresponding lattice sites as adhesive .",
    "typically a pattern is made from 200 x 200 spins and the cell is represented by 30.000 spins .",
    "the length @xmath21 of the total cell interface is calculated with a modified marching square algorithm .",
    "because cell spreading is a relatively slow process ( typical time scale 10 min ) , one can assume that the system is close to mechanical equilibrium and the metropolis algorithm can be used to propagate cell shape . during each step a lattice site at the periphery of the cell",

    "the effective temperature @xmath25 governs the contour fluctuation amplitude ( typical value 0.2 in dimensionless units ) .",
    "only lattice sites at the periphery of the cells are chosen for update attempts because cells do not form spontaneous holes in the bulk or nucleate new material far away from the bulk .",
    "for a cell with @xmath26 lattice sites in its periphery a monte carlo sweep is defined as @xmath26 inversion attempts .",
    "a more detailed description of the implementation can be found in the appendix .",
    "the core of the cpm is defined by the energy functional which we choose to be @xmath27 the first term accounts for the surface tension which scales with the cell area @xmath28 as conjugated quantity .",

    "the third term is the sum over the contribution from each actin edge fiber and a circle is fit to the corresponding part of the contour to calculate @xmath29 .",
    "all of the previously mentioned tensions contract a convexshaped cell and are balanced by the adhesive geometry accounted for by the fourth term .",
    "cells form adhesive contacts with the substrate , and the bond energy of each contact lowers the total energy .",
    "the number of adhesion molecules in a cell is finite and the energy gain by covering more adhesive area therefore saturates with the covered area , @xmath30 .",
    "this choice ensures a linear growth during initial spreading , which later slows down and plateaus , as observed for many different cell types @xcite .",
    "strength and saturation of the adhesive energy are controlled by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "cells in tissue are often described by cpm or vertex models with an energy functional including an elastic ( harmonic ) constraint on the cell area @xcite .",
    "in contrast to tissue , single cells on a substrate are essentially two - dimensional and can increase their projected surface area by taking material from the third dimension or by making use of the excess area stored in the plasma membrane or nearby vesicles .",
    "we therefore do not use an elastic area constraint in our energy functional .",
    "the implications of an elastic area constraint for the spreading dynamics and for the dependence of arc radius on spanning distance are discussed in the appendix .",
    "it is shown there that the third term in eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] can also be interpreted as a saturation effect in membrane tension .",
    "the surface tension has been estimated before as @xmath33 from pillar deflections for endothelial cells @xcite and as @xmath34 from analysis of the traction forces of epithelial cell sheets @xcite .",
    "the simple line tension should be of the order of @xmath35 , which is the typical force acting on focal adhesion connected to the actin cytoskeleton @xcite .",

    "it has been estimated for buffalo rat liver cells cells on hard substrates with purely elastic arcs and a rest length of @xmath36 as @xmath37 @xcite . in our case",
    ", this value has to be reduced for several reasons , namely , that here we consider soft substrates , we have both simple and elastic tension , and we assume that @xmath38 . for typical arcs with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the same arc tension as in the purely elastic case is reached for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . for a typical bundle radius of @xmath43 , this would correspond to a young modulus in the mpa - range , as found experimentally @xcite .",
    "the two remaining parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , can be estimated from the adhesive energy density and the average cell size on homogeneous substrates . for weakly spread cells the adhesive energy gain in eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] becomes @xmath44 as the number of adhesive contacts is not yet saturated .",

    "together with the force generated by the adhesive part this gives the total traction force resulting from our shape model .    for comparison with experimental results ,",
    "several issues have to be taken into account .",
    "first , our model predicts spatially strongly localized forces , whereas in practice they are typically distributed over a stripe of focal adhesions along the cell contour @xcite .",
    "we therefore distribute our simulated forces on a stripe of @xmath59 width beneath the membrane using a disk shaped kernel .",
    "second , our model shows stochastic fluctuations in the cell contour which are expected to be averaged out in experiments .",
    "we therefore average it over @xmath60 monte carlo sweeps to account for the fluctuating contour due to the finite simulation temperature .",
    "third , traction forces are typically reconstructed in experiments by an inverse procedure that filters out displacement noise . to obtain traction data which is comparable to experimental results",
    ", we use the finite element method ( fem ) as implemented in the deal.ii library to calculate the displacement from our cpm . in our fem calculations ,",
    "the forces generated by the cell are applied to the surface of a linear elastic material @xmath61 in area and @xmath62 deep with a displacement - free boundary at the bottom and stress - free boundaries at the sides .",
    "the hexahedral mesh is locally refined beneath the cell .",
    "we then apply the fourier - transform traction cytometry method ( fttc ) @xcite to obtain a traction pattern which can be compared directly with experimental results .",
    "a complete cycle of simulated forces , calculated displacements fields and reconstructed forces can be found in the appendix ( fig .",
    "s4 ) .",
    "we now show that for our model the sum of all traction forces vanishes , as required by momentum conservation . for a contour @xmath63 parametrized by contour length @xmath21 ,",
    "the tangent is normalized and we can use eq .  [ eq : traction_force ] to write the sum of the traction forces resulting from the part of the contour extending from @xmath64 to @xmath65 as @xmath66 the minus in the second term comes from the normal pointing outwards .",

    "moreover , we now have to account for the elastic line tension in the arc according to eq .",
    "[ eq : traction_force_arcs ] . because the arc is circular , the contour endpoints and circle normals are related by @xmath69 . combining this with eqs .",
    "[ noarcresult ] and [ eq : traction_force_arcs ] , the total force becomes @xmath70 rewriting the arc radius in terms of tension , @xmath71 , and rotating the normals with the matrix , @xmath67 , shows that the net force vanishes .",

    "thus , we use the fem to calculate from our simulated forces the displacement fields for an elastic substrate .",
    "we then compare these results to experimental data and fit our three main model parameters , namely , surface tension , @xmath0 , simple line tension , @xmath11 , and elastic line tension @xmath14 . in fig .",

    "the parameters responsible for the adhesive energy gain , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are found to be unimportant for the fit quality . due to the small number of cells on the pacman pattern ,",
    "we exclude it from the fit .",
    "both the pacman and circular - disc patterns show the localization of displacements at the cell contour , as predicted by our model . for the circular disc , which only has continuously adhesive edges , the displacements are directed radially inward everywhere",
    "this is different in the case of the pacman pattern , where in both the simulation and the experiment displacements deviate from the radial symmetry at the tips of the wedge .",
    "the displacements there point inward because of the actin edge bundle forming across the wedge .",
    "cells described by the stm would have displacements pointing slightly away from the wedge because of the curvature of the cell contour there .",
    "the fit of our model parameters is dominated by the larger adhesive parts of the contour for those patterns .",
    "the stm and tem predict similar magnitudes , which makes it difficult to distinguish between the two .",
    "displacements for the crossbow are dominated more strongly by the two actin edge bundles and are largest at the extremities of the pattern due to the high curvature and bundles originating there .",
    "the experimental displacements in both arms of the crossbow are directed more upward than expected from the model .",
    "this might indicate the effect of internal actin fibers connecting from the tips to the top of the micropattern .",
    "on the other hand , displacements of the circular pattern and circular part of the crossbow pattern are very similar in magnitude and direction , indicating that polarized internal fibers only play a minor role in this case .    to quantify the quality of the fit we use the norm @xmath99 , which is the squared and normalized distance between the experimental and simulated displacement fields . for the stm the fit yields a simple line tension of @xmath100 , surface tension of @xmath101 and a @xmath102-value of 0.16 .",
    "for the tem the fit yields @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and a @xmath102-value of 0.15 .",
    "the tem fits the data better , but the difference is small , since both the disc and crossbow are dominated by large convex parts where actin edge bundles are unimportant .",
    "the tem decreases the simple line tension while increasing the surface tension .",
    "as discussed above for spreading on the v - shaped pattern , the tem allows the cell to pull its contour outward above nonadhesive parts of the substrate with a reduced simple tension .",
    "the increased surface tension in the tem compensates for the reduced simple tension , but the contribution of the surface tension is curvature - independent .",
    "thus , the tem allows smaller forces in regions of high curvature while keeping forces in small - curvature regions the same as in the stm .    the overall agreement of our model with the experimental displacements demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bestfit05 ] is quite good .",
    "however , the experimental displacements decay more slowly than the simulated ones , for several possible reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath106 wide stripe beneath the membrane where we apply forces to the substrate might be too narrow , and the size of the adhesions might vary with force @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data can be improved by increasing the stripe width to @xmath107 , but this does not appear to be reasonable given the actual size of the adhesions and the feature size of the micropattern .",
    "it is therefore more likely that the disagreement arises from the limited resolution of bead tracking and from the registration and averaging procedures , both of which blur the displacement fields .",
    "variations in the pattern shapes from manufacturing or by deformation from the cells also widen the force spots and make pattern registration more difficult . because these experimental limitations might be improved in the future , for our theoretical predictions here we keep the @xmath106 scale for the adhesion width .",
    "the top row shows reconstructed traction forces for the tem with the best fit parameters ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) and the bottom row traction forces reconstructed from experimental data for mcf10a - cells on fibronectin patterns on a polyacrylamide substrate .",
    "experimental data reproduced from @xcite with permission of the royal society of chemistry.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    given the displacement data discussed above , one can now reconstruct traction forces that resemble those obtained from experimental data .",
    "for this purpose , we use fttc with regularization @xcite . in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : ballandreconstruction ] we show the traction force reconstructed from the simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bestfit05 ] . a comparison with the experimental data ( fig .  [ fig : bestfit05 ] , lower row ) @xcite shows that our procedure predicts most of the experimental features .",
    "the only exception seems to be the additional localization of experimental traction forces in the upper part of the crossbow pattern , which might be due to the occasional presence of internal stress fibers along the long side of this pattern .",

    "the influence of cell shape on force generation is best seen by gradually changing the adhesive geometry . both curvature and spanning distance of the free arcs",
    "are varied in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvaturechange ] as the t - shaped pattern is transformed into a crossbow for cells described by the tem . for all shapes",
    ", the forces are localized to the extremities of the patterns , but increasing the curvature relocalizes them from the end points to the adhesive edge of the contour , and at the same time the force direction in the prominent force spots changes from being aligned with the edge bundles to a more radial orientation .",
    "both observations , the force increase in the adhesive contour and the orientation change , have been observed for rpe1 cells @xcite .",
    "the increase of forces with higher curvature at the adhesive contour is a consequence of the simple line tension acting in the contour ( compare eq .",
    "[ eq : traction_force ] ) .",
    "the prominent force spots in the extremities are due to the larger curvature and the edge bundles being anchored there .",
    "changing the curvature of the top bar also decreases the spanning distance , and therefore the force in the bundles , from @xmath111 in the t - shaped pattern to @xmath112 in the final crossbow , which explains the decrease of forces in the prominent spots and also the directional change , since arc forces become less important .",
    "the force spot at the bottom of the t - shaped pattern is less localized compared to that in the final crossbow , because the edge bundles do not always attach to the outermost part of this pattern",

    "the cpm approach is a very helpful exploratory tool for quickly assessing the effect of a newly designed micropattern .",
    "in summary , the cpm is a versatile tool for robust prediction of cell shapes and forces on any micropattern of interest .",
    "the underlying reason is that it actually models the dynamic process of shape determination .",
    "thus , it also makes predictions on spreading dynamics and does not require any a priori knowledge of the final shape .",
    "as shown above , all of our predictions agree quite well with published experimental data .",
    "to adapt the cpm for the prediction of shapes and forces of single cells on two - dimensional micropatterns , we have made several modifications to the original formulation of the cpm model for cell shape in tissue . despite its large contribution to the current understanding of cell sorting and cell shapes in tissue @xcite ,",
    "the cpm has been used before only a few times to describe single cells @xcite . to further advance this approach , we have added two essential elements to the conventional cpm formulation .",
    "motivated by the tem , we have added an elastic line tension to describe the effect of contour reinforcement of edge bundles .",
    "moreover , we have added an adhesion term to the energy functional that does not constrain cell area but acts like a reservoir for additional area that can be used if sufficient ligand is present .",
    "the good agreement of our model with experimental data , demonstrated here , confirms that our energy functional describes the main features of this system .",
    "one of the biggest advantages of our approach is that it is computationally inexpensive ( typical runtime is on the subsecond timescale ) , thus making it an ideal exploratory tool for quickly establishing typical cell behavior on micropatterns without any a priori knowledge of the final shape .",
    "our model reveals that the tem model allows for faster cell spreading within a reasonable parameter range and that elastic arcs act to relieve tension from adhesive parts of the contour while maintaining the same cell shape .",
    "the tem makes spreading above nonadhesive parts easier and at the same time allows the cell to generate traction forces more by bulk than by contour tension .",
    "our cpm assumes that spreading is limited mainly by the availability of adhesion receptors , thus leading to saturation in adhesive area .",
    "this approach neglects other potential limitations of spreading , most notably the effect of increased membrane tension @xcite.as shown in the appendix , to first order the energy functional of eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] does not make a fundamental distinction between these two limitations for spreading .",
    "however , appropriately designed micropatterns might in fact be an appealing way to investigate these important questions in the future , both in experiments and in the framework of the cpm .",
    "combining the cpm with a contour model allowed us to interpret the energy terms in the cpm energy functional as tensions and provided an easy way to predict traction forces .",
    "the contour model also connects our three model parameters , namely , simple line tension , elastic line tension , and surface tension , to the cell geometry via the relation between spanning distance and arc radius ( eq .",
    "[ eq : radiusspanning ] ) .",
    "for each cell type of interest , our model parameters can be fitted to the experimentally observed cell shape on a reference pattern and then used to predict cell shape and forces on other patterns .",
    "as more information becomes available for the detailed molecular structure of actin cortex and peripheral fibers , our model can be modified to include such information , e.g. , by replacing the tem term in the energy functional of eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] with a more detailed expression .",
    "there are two important aspects of cell adhesion to micropatterns that are not addressed in this study .",
    "first , our model does not describe the effect of internal structures like nonperipheral stress fibers.we expect that this is a good approximation , as long as several cells are averaged to obtain a generic result that averages out individual inhomogeneities .",
    "otherwise , more detailed models are required that also include internal stress fibers @xcite .",
    "such extensions might profit from recent advances in our understanding of the internal structure and dynamics of different kinds of stress fibers @xcite .",
    "second , our model does not explicitly describe the effect of the mechanical feedback between elastic substrate and cell adhesion , which allows the cell to sense the rigidity of its environment @xcite . to include this important aspect in our model",
    ", it had to be extended by models of the mechanosensitive organization of the adhesion structure and the actin cytoskeleton @xcite . at the current stage ,",
    "the effect of stiffness is incorporated by fitting the model parameters to experimental reference data and calculating displacement fields with the correct rigidity values of the substrate .    here",
    ", we have focused on spreading dynamics and steady - state properties of sessile cells . in this case",
