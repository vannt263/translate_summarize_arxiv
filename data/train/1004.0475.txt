    "the point at infinity is most often an _ irregular singular point _ for equations arising in applications . within this class of equations , there are essentially two types for which a global description of solutions exists : linear systems and integrable ones .",
    "however , in a stricter sense , even for some linear problems global questions such as explicit values of connection coefficients are still open .",
    "the behavior of the general solutions of _ linear _ odes has been thoroughly analyzed starting in the late 19th century , see @xcite and @xcite and references therein .",
    "after the pioneering work of calle , ramis , sibuya and others the description of their solutions in @xmath1 is by now quite well understood @xcite .",
    "_ integrable _ systems provide another important class of systems allowing for global description of solutions .",
    "the ensemble of integrable systems is a zero measure set in the parameter space of general equations : a generic small perturbation of an integrable system destroys integrability . nonetheless , integrable equations occur remarkably often in many areas of mathematics , such as orthogonal polynomials , the analysis of the riemann - zeta function , random matrix theory , self - similar solutions of integrable pdes and combinatorics , cf .",
    "@xcite,@xcite@xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , even in integrable systems , achieving global control of solutions in a _ practical way _ is a challenging task , and it is one of the important aims of the emerging painlev project @xcite .    in _",
    "nonintegrable _ systems , particularly near irregular singularities , our understanding is much more limited .",
    "small solutions are given by generalized borel summable _ transseries _ ; this was discovered by calle in the 1980s and proved rigorously in many contexts subsequently .",
    "transseries are essentially formal multiseries in powers of @xmath2 @xmath3 , and possibly @xmath4 ; see again @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is the independent variable and @xmath6 are eigenvalues of the linearization with the property @xmath7 . in general , _ only _ small solutions are well understood .",
    "however , for generic nonlinear systems of higher order , small solutions form lower dimensional manifolds in the space of all solutions , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the present understanding of general nonlinear equations is thus quite limited .",
    "we introduce a new line of approach , combining ideas from generalized borel summability and kam theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) for the analysis near infinity , chosen to be an irregular singular point , of solutions of relatively general differential equations with meromorphic coefficients . applying the method does not require knowledge of borel summability , transseries or kam theory .",
    "for small solutions , in @xcite it was shown that in a region adjacent to the sector where the solution , @xmath8 , is small , @xmath9 is almost periodic . in this sense @xmath8",
    "becomes an approximately cyclic variable . in the @xmath5-complex plane ,",
    "the singular points of @xmath8 are arranged in quasi - periodic arrays as well .",
    "the analysis in @xcite covers an angularly small region beyond the sector where @xmath8 is small .",
    "looking directly at the asymptotics of @xmath8 beyond this region would require a multiscale approach : @xmath8 has a periodic behavior  the fast scale , with @xmath10 changes in the quasi - period .",
    "multiscale analysis is usually a quite involved procedure ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is natural to make a hodograph transformation in which the dependent and independent variables are switched .",
    "as mentioned above , in the `` nontrivial '' regions , the dependent variable is an almost cyclic one .",
    "the setting becomes somewhat similar to a kam one : there is an underlying completely integrable system , and one looks for persistence of invariant tori .",
    "adiabatic invariants are simply the conserved quantities associated with these tori .",
    "evidently there are many differences between the ode setting and the kam one , for instance the fact that the small parameter is `` internal '' , @xmath11 .    in this work",
    "we restrict the analysis to first order equations , mainly to ensure a transparent and concrete analysis . in theory however , the method generalizes to equations of any order , and we touch on these issues at the end of the paper .",
    "we look at equations which , after normalization , are of the form @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 bi - analytic at @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    we show that in any sector on riemann surfaces towards infinity , the _ general _ solution is represented by transseries and/ or , in an implicit form , by some constant of motion .",
    "in fact , on large circles around @xmath17 , the solution cycles among transseries representations and ones in which constants of motion describe it accurately .",
    "the regions where these behaviors occur overlap slightly to allow for asymptotic matching ( cf .",
    "corollary [ c1 ] ) .",
    "the connection between the large @xmath5 behavior and the initial condition is relatively easy to obtain .",
    "let @xmath18 .",
    "the constants of motion have asymptotic expansions of the form @xmath19 clearly , under the assumptions above , the solution @xmath8 can be obtained asymptotically from and the implicit function theorem .",
    "the requirement that @xmath20 is to leading order of the form @xmath21 , determines @xmath20 up to trivial transformations , see theorem [ t1 ] and note [ n1 ] .",
    "the functions @xmath22 are shown in the proof of theorem [ t1 ] to solve first order autonomous odes , and thus they can always be calculated by quadratures .    to illustrate this ,",
    "we use a nonintegrable abel equation , @xmath23    we note that there is no consensus on how nonintegrabilty should be defined ; for ( [ eq : abel ] ) , it is the case that the equation passes no criterion of integrability , including the poly - painlev test , and that there are no solutions known , explicit or coming from , say , some associated riemann - hilbert reformulation .",
    "the abel equation has the normal form ( see  [ sable ] , where further details about this example are given ) @xmath24 regions of smallness are those for which @xmath8 approaches a root of @xmath25 ; in these regions , @xmath8 is given by a transseries @xcite .",
    "otherwise , @xmath8 has an implicit representation of the form @xmath26 obtained by inverting an appropriate constant of motion @xmath20 ( see ) ; for the values of @xmath27 see  [ s4 ] .",
    "while in a numerical approach to calculating solutions the precision deteriorates as @xmath5 becomes large , the accuracy of instead , _",
    "increases_. in examples , even when is truncated to two orders , is strikingly close to the actual solution even for relatively small values of the independent variable , see e.g. figure[fig : abel4 ] .",
    "the procedure allows for a convenient way to link initial conditions to global asymptotic behavior , see e.g. .",
    "first order equations for which the associated second order autonomous system is hamiltonian are in particular _",
    "integrable_. indeed , by their definition , there is a globally defined smooth @xmath28 with the property that @xmath29 , that is @xmath30 , providing a closed form implicit , global representation of @xmath8 .",
    "while the differential equation provides `` infinitesimal '' information , @xmath28 effectively an integral provides a global one .",
    "conversely , clearly , if there exists an implicit solution of the equation or indeed a smooth enough conserved quantity , the equation comes from a hamiltonian system .",
    "what we provide is a finite set of matching conserved quantities , analogous to an atlas of overlapping maps projecting the differential field onto the trivial one , @xmath31 .",
    "they give , in a sense , a _ foliation of the phase space _ allowing for global control of solutions . with obvious adaptations",
    ", this picture extends to higher order systems . in integrable systems",
    "there is just one single - valued map and the field is globally rectifiable . in general , the conserved quantities may be branched and not globally defined .",
    "many equations of the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 analytic for small @xmath8 and small @xmath11 can be brought to the normal form @xmath34 by systematic changes of variables , see _",

    "]      we illustrate how to find singularities of the abel s equation using proposition [ sincom ] .",
    "it is known @xcite that there are only square root singularities , and they appear in two arrays .    for simplicity",
    "we choose a simple singular path along which @xmath8 goes to @xmath305 .    according to proposition [ sincom ] we have @xmath306    thus the position of the singularity",
    "is given by the formula @xmath307 where the initial condition @xmath248 satisfies @xmath308 is large and @xmath309 is not close to any of the three roots .",
    "we note that the presence of the arctan in the leading order implies that the solutions remain quasi - periodic beyond the domain accessible to the methods in @xcite . in ( [ asing ] )",
    "we have the freedom of choosing branch of @xmath300 and @xmath301 , which enables us to find arrays of singularities .    for example , the position of a singularity corresponding to the initial condition @xmath310 , calculated using ( [ asing ] ) is @xmath311 , which is accurate with six significant digits , as checked numerically .",
    "the detailed behavior of the solution near the singularity can be found by expanding the right hand side of ( [ asing ] ) .",
    "we omit the calculation here since there are many other methods to determine this behavior ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and it is of lesser importance to the paper .",
    "we choose a path consisting of line segments the path in @xmath5 consists of line segments connecting @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 , @xmath315 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 , and @xmath316 .",

    "some of these values are approached more than once along the entire path .",

    "the @xmath330 marks are the three roots . ]    on the line segment connecting @xmath312 and @xmath313 , it is clear that the initial condition @xmath331 is in the basin of attraction of @xmath292 ( cf . fig .",

    "if the solution @xmath8 approaches a limit cycle , it must lie in an @xmath108-domain .",
    "thus the formal constant motion formula ( [ eq : def2c ] ) is valid , and the first term @xmath66 specifies a direction for @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 goes strictly along this direction towards @xmath335 then the term @xmath336 , which does not vanish in our case , will go to @xmath335 , contradicting the results about the constant of motion . on the other hand , if @xmath5 goes in a different direction , then @xmath337 goes to @xmath335 much faster than @xmath336 , again a contradiction .      for higher orders , such as the painlev equations p1 and p2 , a similar procedure works , though the details are quite a bit more complicated , and we leave them for a subsequent work .",

    "the functions @xmath349 , @xmath350 , @xmath351 have similar but longer expressions .",
    "we note the absence of a term of the form @xmath336 ( the reason for this is easy to see once the calculation is performed ) .",
    "a second constant can now be obtained by reduction of order and applying the first order techniques , or better , by the `` action - angle '' approach described in the introduction .",

    "there is directionality in the asymptotics , as the loops encircling the singularities need to be rigidly chosen according to the asymptotic direction studied .",
    "a slightly different representation allows us to calculate the constants to all orders .",
    "because of directionality , a different asymptotic formula exists and is more useful for the `` lateral connection '' , that is , for calculating the solution along a circle of fixed but large radius , which will be detailed in a separate paper , as part of the painlev project , see e.g. @xcite .",
