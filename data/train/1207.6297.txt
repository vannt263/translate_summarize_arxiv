    "the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations@xcite are arguably the most convenient and frequently employed tool in studying spatially inhomogeneous superconducting condensates .",
    "originally these equations were derived using the free - energy functional introduced by landau@xcite to describe a system in the vicinity of the phase transition . a relation between this phenomenological theory and the microscopic bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) model",
    "has subsequently been established by gorkov.@xcite both the landau theory and the gorkov derivation impose restrictions on the validity domain of the gl equations . however , the intuitively transparent physical ideas behind the landau theory as well as the long history of its successful applications have led to a general belief that the gl approach correctly captures , at least qualitatively , essential physics of the superconducting state not only in the vicinity of the critical temperature but in a much wider range of physically plausible situations",
    ".    strikingly , generalization of the gl theory for multi - band superconductors has encountered serious difficulties related to the intrinsic inconsistencies of its derivation from the microscopic formalism . in particular , it seems straightforward to generalize the gorkov derivation to the two - band case , which gives a system of two gl - like equations linearly coupled through the josephson - like term ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "however , it has recently been revealed that a solution to these equations is inconsistent with their derivation due to the presence of incomplete higher - order contributions in @xmath3.@xcite a correct reconstruction of the two - component gl - like model with account of the accuracy of all the relevant contributions maps the resulting approach onto the single - band gl theory : the two band order parameters turn out to be strictly proportional to one another.@xcite    this observation displays a serious shortcoming of , let us call it , the ordinary gl theory for two - band superconductors .",
    "physically , the spatial characteristics of the band condensates , e.g. , the healing lengths , must be generally different .",
    "therefore , the important physics coming from the disparity between the spatial characteristics of the different band condensates is not captured by the ordinary gl approach .",
    "notice that many phenomena of current interest are directly related to the difference in the healing lengths of the band condensates , such as , e.g. , the non - monotonic interaction between vortices,@xcite being a possible explanation@xcite for highly debated unusual vortex configurations observed in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , see refs .   and .",
    "effects due to the difference in the spatial profiles of different band condensates can be accounted for within the full microscopic treatment , i.e. , by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes , gorkov or semiclassical eilenberger equations.@xcite however , a solution to these equations can , as a rule , be obtained only numerically , and the corresponding calculations , especially in the multi - band case , require enormous computational efforts .",
    "this has significantly limited the progress in the full - microscopic study of spatially nonuniform condensates ( even in the single - band case ! ) , where such analysis can be done only with additional , very restrictive assumptions e.g. , by introducing the abrikosov ansatz for multiple - vortex configurations ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "such enormous difficulties stimulated a search for an extended gl formalism that would retain the simplicity of the ordinary gl equations .",
    "since the development of the original gl theory , many variants of its extension have been proposed ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the most straightforward procedure is to continue the expansion of the free energy functional by including higher powers of the order parameter(s ) and its spatial gradients .",
    "unfortunately , as is known , this procedure introduces additional difficulties .",
    "one of them is the problem of selecting all relevant contributions of the same order of magnitude , which is not trivial for the terms that contain spatial derivatives of the order parameter(s ) .",
    "another problem is related to increased nonlinearity and to the appearance of higher - order spatial derivatives in the resulting equations .",
    "analysis of such nonlinear equations is not only considerably more complicated@xcite but can also suffer from unphysical solutions , such as that with a characteristic length - scale much smaller than the gl coherence length.@xcite    it has recently been demonstrated@xcite that these problems can be overcome if one directly employs the proximity of the system to the critical temperature , i.e. , using @xmath1 as a single small parameter in the system rather than the order parameter and its spatial derivatives . as is well known from the gl theory",
    ", @xmath6 controls all the relevant quantities and their spatial gradients . within this approach , the gl theory and its extension follow from the systematic @xmath6-expansion of the free energy and the gap equation .",
    "an important advantage of using the @xmath6-expansion is that the extension to the gl theory is specified by linear differential equations that do not have unphysical solutions and can be easily solved numerically and , in many cases , even analytically .",
    "for the two - band system this approach has been briefly outlined in ref .   where the main steps of the derivation were presented and the prime physical conclusions were discussed , namely , that the difference between the spatial profiles of the band condensates is captured in the leading correction to the ordinary gl theory . for the sake of clarity the analysis in that work has been restricted to the case of zero magnetic field .",
    "validity and accuracy of the obtained equations have not been discussed .",
    "subsequently , in ref .",
    "we have provided details of the derivation of the extended gl theory for a single - band clean superconductor with the @xmath0-wave pairing in the general case of a non - zero magnetic field .    with latter works as a basis , we here continue the development of the extended gl model , by now giving a detailed derivation of the _ extended gl formalism for a two - band system by means of a systematic expansion in @xmath6_. unlike ref .  , where the formalism was obtained after two coupled gap equations had been explicitly separated , here we find the series expansion in @xmath6 for the original system of the two equations for two band order parameters in the matrix form . while being more transparent and intuitively clear , this approach significantly simplifies the technical aspects and also allows a generalization to the case of multiple contributing bands .",

    "the scaling of the spatial coordinates applies also to the spatial derivatives as @xmath47 and is reflected in the scaling for the magnetic field as @xmath48 .",

    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) is not dictated by the need of a proper selection of the relevant terms but is applied for the sake of simplifying our formulas .",
    "notice that unlike ref .  , where the existence of a single scaling parameter is obvious from the gl theory , the use of such a single small parameter in the presence of two(many ) bands requires an additional justification .",
    "for example , if one considers non - interacting band condensates with different critical temperatures , no unique small parameter can be found .",
    "the reason why the single - parameter - scaling procedure is applicable for the interacting condensates , follows from the earlier analysis where the matrix gap equation was decoupled into two separate equations for each condensate.@xcite it has been demonstrated that for non - zero interband coupling , the separated equations are governed by the same parameter @xmath6 measuring the deviation from the single critical temperature . in this paper",
    "we directly employ this fact without following the same procedure of the explicit separation into two equations for the band components .",

    "we have shown that the extended gl theory has an overall superior quantitative accuracy in comparison with the existing ( and often used ) variants of the tc model .",
    "the reason for this is that the tc model only captures correctly the lowest - order contribution in @xmath6 to the band order parameters and fails to produce all the relevant terms in the next - to - leading order .",
    "this intrinsic shortcoming of the tc model is crucial in many situations , e.g. , in studies of the disparity between the length - scales of two condensates , which appears only in the next - to - leading order of the @xmath6 expansion for the band order parameters .",
    "thus , revisiting those problems investigated previously within the tc formalism is certainly needed .",
    "we finally conclude that the extended gl theory provides a reliable and solid formalism , with a clearly defined applicability range , that will be very useful in theoretical studies of electronic , magnetic , calorimetric , and other properties of two - band superconductors .",
    "in particular , one of the most promising applications of the extended gl formalism will be a search for exotic multiple - vortex configurations that can appear due to an attractive interaction between vortices induced by the competition between different length - scales of the different band condensates .",
