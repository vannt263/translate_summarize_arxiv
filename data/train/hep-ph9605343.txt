    "many models have been proposed in the literature that give the standard model ( sm ) [ 1 ] in the low energy limit .",
    "one of these models is the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) [ 2 ] , with a @xmath8 gauge group . in this class of models",
    "the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken giving different masses to the left and right - handed gauge bosons . in the low - energy limit",
    "the lrsm becomes the sm and small deviations could be observed making high precision experiments . in order to know how many light neutrinos have the sm we need to know the value of the partial decay width @xmath9",
    "however , this process is such that no final states are observed .",
    "hence , the only way to get information about this partial decay is from the invisible width @xmath10 .",
    "the number @xmath0 is defined as a combination of the experimental and the theoretical magnitudes of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 and it is then identified with the number of light neutrinos .",
    "recent experimental analysis on @xmath0 , in the framework of the sm , gives as a result @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we make the calculation of @xmath0 in the lrsm .",
    "we found that in this case the quantity defined as @xmath0 is not a constant but depends on the mixing angle @xmath4 and therefore is not necessarily an integer number .",
    "we give an estimation of the value @xmath0 in this model using experimental data and also from previous constraints on the @xmath4 angle .    in sec .",
    "2 we describe the model , whereas in sec .",
    "3 we discuss the meaning of @xmath0 in the lrsm and give the results of the calculation and also our conclusions .",
    "in the lrsm the lagrangian that describes the interaction between the leptons and the neutral gauge bosons is _",
    "n = gj_l^3w_l^3+gj_r^3w_r^3+gj_yb where @xmath15 is the neutral gauge boson of the @xmath16 sector of the model that couples with the right - handed current @xmath17 of leptons .",
    "we are interested in the lrsm with a bidoublet and two doublets in the higss sector ; this higss content necessarily implies dirac neutrinos .",
    "after the spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry , the gauge bosons become mass eigenstates and therefore linear combinations of @xmath18 , @xmath15 and @xmath19 .",
    "the relation between the mass eigenstates and the interaction eigenstates is given through a mixing matrix .",
    "this mixing matrix depends on two angles : @xmath20 , the sm electroweak parameter , and @xmath4 , that mixes the left and right handed gauge bosons , after imposing the condition that the electromagnetic current has to couple to the photon .",
    "the mixing can be realized in two steps [ 4 ] : (    cz_1 + z_2 + a    ) = (    cccc_&-s_&0 + s_&c_&0 + 0&0&1    ) (    cccc_w&-s_wt_w&-t_wr_w + 0&r_w / c_w&-t_w + s_w&s_w&r_w    ) (    cw^3_l + w^3_r + b    ) with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in terms of the mass eigenstates the general lagrangian responsible for the neutral current interactions is written as _",
    "n = ej_ema-(a_1j_l^z+b_1j_r^z)z_1 + ( a_2j_l^z+b_2j_r^z)z_2 where a_1&=&- + b_1&= & + a_2&=&+ + b_2&= & in the limit @xmath26 and @xmath27 we get the sm lagrangian . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) we have all the information we need to calculate the process @xmath28 .",
    "if we are working at the @xmath29 peak , the amplitude for the decay @xmath30 comes from the second term of ( 3 ) and is given by [ 4 ] m= _",
    "^where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 boson polarization , @xmath33 @xmath34 is the lepton ( antilepton ) spinor and g_v_lr=|g_v -s_g_v_r , g_a_lr=|g_a + s_g_a_r here @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the vector ( axial - vector ) coupling constant for charged leptons with radiative corrections that comes from the left - handed sector of the model : |g_v&=&(-+2_f^2_w ) +    same coupling constant as before but without radiative corrections and has its origin in the right - handed sector .",
    "+ for the decay of @xmath32 in neutrinos we also have corrections for the coupling constants that comes only from the lrsm : g_v_lr^=(c_-)g^and g_a_lr^=(c_+s_r_w)g^where @xmath37 .",
    "+ in the framework of the lrsm model , the width for the process @xmath38 is written as ( zl|l)= in eq . ( 11 ) we have neglected the mass of the leptons . in the case of the decay",
    "@xmath39 the expression ( 11 ) becomes ( z|)= ( g^)^2 in the limit when @xmath4 goes to zero we obtain the sm tree level partial decay width : _ 0(z|)= the partial widths ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) are applicable to all charged leptons and all neutrinos respectively . in order to use the expressions ( 11 ) and",
    "( 12 ) for comparing with the experimental result for the number of light neutrinos @xmath0 we recall the experimental definition for @xmath0 in a sm analysis [ 7 ] , n_=r_exp ( ) _ sm . here , the quantity in parenthesis is the standard model prediction and the @xmath40 factor is the experimental value of the ratio between the widths @xmath41 and @xmath42 [ 5 ] , r_exp==5.9420.067 .",
    "the definition ( 14 ) for @xmath0 replaces the expression @xmath43 , since ( 14 ) reduces the influence of the top quark mass .",
    "+ if we want to get information about what is the meaning of @xmath0 in the lrsm model we should define the corresponding expression , n__lr = r_exp ( ) _ lrthis new expression will be a function of @xmath4 , so in this case the quantity defined as the number of light neutrinos is not a constant and not necessarily an integer . also @xmath3 in formula ( 16 ) is independent from the @xmath44 mass and therefore depends on only one parameter of the lrsm .",
    "experimental values for @xmath11 and for @xmath42 are reported in literature which in our case , can give a bound for the angle @xmath4 .",
    "however , we can look to these experimental numbers in another way . the partial widths @xmath45 and @xmath46 were reported recently [ 8 ] , but we use here the value ( 15 ) for the @xmath40 rate of ref . [ 5 ] .",
    "all these measurements are independent of any model and can be fitted with the lrsm parameter @xmath3 in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "we can plot the expression ( 16 ) to see the general behavior of the @xmath47 function .",
    "( 1 ) is this plot .",
    "we can observe that for some values of @xmath4 , around 0.6 rad , @xmath3 can be as high as 5.9 , and for values of @xmath4 around @xmath48 rad , @xmath3 is as low as 0 .",
    "this indicates a strong dependence on @xmath4 for leptonic decays of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , according to the above discussion , if we consider @xmath3 as the number of neutrinos , the restriction on the number of generations can be `` softened '' if we consider a lrsm model .",
    "+ however @xmath4 is severely bounded , so it is @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we show the allowed region for @xmath3 with 90% c. l. the allowed region is the inclined band that is a result of both factors in eq .",
    "( 16 ) : @xmath49 gives the inclination and @xmath40 gives the broading .",
    "the analysis was done using the experimental value ( 15 ) for @xmath40 reported by aleph collaboration [ 5 ] with a 90% c. l. the region for @xmath4 is given from a previous constraint on this angle [ 4 ] : @xmath50 , obtained from the lep experimental value of @xmath51 [ 7 ] .",
    "in the same figure we show the sm ( @xmath52 ) result at 90% c. l. with the solid horizontal lines .",
    "as we can see , the allowed region in the lr model ( dotted line ) for @xmath3 is wider that the one for the sm , and is given by : 2.90n__lr3.04 .",
    "although the allowed region is wider , the fact that the mixing angle has been extremely restricted forces @xmath3 to be near 3 , excluding the possibility to get a number such as 2.6 which has been reported as an upper bound from big bang nucleosynthesis [ 9 ] . in order to get this value we need @xmath53 , which is in contradiction with the present restrictions on @xmath4",
    ".    finally , and just for completeness",
    ", we can reverse the arguments , that is , we fix the number of neutrinos in the lrsm to be three then the theoretical expression for @xmath54 will be given by r=. if we make a plot of this quantity in terms of @xmath4 we have the curve shown in fig.(3 ) .",
    "the horizontal lines give the experimental region at 90 % c. l. as we can see from the figure the constraint for the @xmath4 angle is : @xmath55 .",
    "this restriction is in close agreement with the constraint previously obtained in ref .",
    "[ 4 ] . + as a conclusion we can say that in the left - right symmetric model we can obtain from experimental results a value for @xmath0 different from 3 ( not necessarily an integer number ) . in particular for the lrsm with two doublets , and",
    "hence with dirac neutrinos , @xmath3 is in the neighborhood of three , however , if new precision experiments find small deviations from 3 , this model could explain very well these deviations with a small value of @xmath4 .",
