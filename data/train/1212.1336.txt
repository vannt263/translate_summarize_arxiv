    "a complete mapping of the nucleon excitation spectrum is the key to a detailed understanding of the effective degrees of freedom of the nucleon and its associated dynamics .",
    "the most comprehensive predictions of this spectrum have come from various implementations of the constituent quark model incorporating broken su(6 ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "additional dynamical contributions from gluonic excitations in the wavefunction may also play a central role  @xcite and resonances may be dynamically generated through baryon - meson interactions  @xcite .",
    "quark model calculations of the nucleon spectrum have predicted more states than have been seen experimentally  @xcite . this has been termed the `` missing '' resonance problem , and the existence of these states",
    "is tied in directly with the underlying degrees of freedom of the nucleon that govern hadronic production at moderate energies  @xcite .",
    "ideally we should expect that the fundamental theory that governs the strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , should provide a reliable prediction of the nucleon excitation spectrum .",
    "however , due to the non - perturbative nature of qcd at these energies , this expectation has not yet been fully realized",
    ". there has been notable recent progress in calculations of qcd on the lattice that has led to predictions of the nucleon excitation spectrum with dynamical quarks , albeit with unphysical pion masses @xcite .",
    "calculations with improved actions , larger volumes , and smaller quark masses continue to progress .    in parallel",
    ", the development of coupled - channel models , such as those developed by the groups at bonn - gatchina  @xcite , giessen  @xcite , jlich  @xcite , and ebac @xcite , have made significant progress toward deconvoluting the nucleon spectrum .",
    "these multi - channel partial wave analyses have employed partial wave fits from said  @xcite based on @xmath10 elastic data to determine the properties of most @xmath11 and @xmath12 resonances listed in the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite .",
    "further critical information on the decay modes was obtained by including the inelastic reactions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "recently the data landscape has undergone significant change with the publication of a vast amount of precision data in the photoproduction sector from jlab , spring-8 , mami , bonn , and graal .",
    "data sets spanning a broad angular and energy range for @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 have provided high precision differential cross sections and polarization observables .",
    "furthermore , new observables with polarized beams on both polarized proton and neutron targets have recently been acquired at several facilities and will be published over the next several years .    in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 electroproduction sector , dramatic changes to the world",
    "s database occurred with the publications from the clas collaboration .",
    "these include ( i ) beam - recoil transferred polarization for @xmath0  @xcite and for @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite , ( ii ) separated structure functions @xmath23 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as well as @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite , and ( iii ) polarized structure function @xmath5 for @xmath0  @xcite .",

    "the full set of differential cross sections @xmath26 included in this work consists of 480 ( 450 ) bins in @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath27 for the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) final state and 3840 ( 3600 ) data points in @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath27 , and @xmath6 for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the organization for this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] , the different theoretical models that are compared against the data are briefly described . in section  [ formalism ] , the relevant formalism for the expression of the electroproduction cross sections and separated structure functions is introduced .",
    "section  [ analysis ] details the experimental setup and describes all analysis cuts and corrections to the data .",
    "section  [ systematics ] details the sources of systematic uncertainty on the measured cross sections and separated structure functions , which are presented in section  [ results ] along with a series of legendre polynomial fits to the structure function data .",
    "finally , we present a summary of this work and our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "to date the pdg lists only four @xmath11 states , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , with known couplings to @xmath14 and no @xmath11 states are listed that couple to @xmath15  @xcite ; only a single @xmath12 state , @xmath32 , is listed with coupling strength to @xmath15 .",
    "the branching ratios to @xmath33 provided for these states are typically less than 10% with uncertainties of the size of the measured coupling . while the relevance of this core set of @xmath11 states in the @xmath34 reaction",
    "has long been considered a well - established fact , this set of states falls short of reproducing the experimental results below @xmath9=2  gev .",
    "furthermore , recent analyses  @xcite have called the importance of the @xmath29 state into question .    beyond the core set of @xmath11 states , the pdg lists the @xmath31 state as the sole established @xmath11 near 1900  mev . however , with a 500-mev width quoted by some measurements , it is unlikely that this state by itself could explain the @xmath0 cross sections below @xmath9=2  gev , unless its parameters are significantly different than those given by the pdg .",
    "recent analyses  @xcite have shown this state to be necessary to describe the clas beam - recoil polarization data  @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath31 state is predicted by symmetric quark models and its existence is not expected in diquark models . in the recent fits of @xmath35 data , all @xmath11 resonances found to be necessary to fit the @xmath0 data have been included .",
    "however , the existing @xmath1 database is smaller than the @xmath0 database , with significantly larger statistical uncertainties .",
    "a recent development in understanding the @xmath11 spectrum was provided by the bonn - gatchina coupled - channel partial wave analysis of the hadronic @xmath10 channels and the photoproduced @xmath36 channels  @xcite .",
    "this work presents an up - to - date listing of pole parameters and branching fractions for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 states up to @xmath372  gev with uncertainties at the level of a few percent . that analysis provided a list of ( i ) six @xmath11 states with coupling to @xmath14 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath31 , ( ii ) five @xmath11 states with coupling to @xmath15 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath31 , @xmath41 , and ( iii ) four @xmath12 states with coupling to @xmath15 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath32 , @xmath44 . for more on this list of states that couple to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , see ref .",

    "the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite are based on a significant amount of precision experimental data and the sophisticated coupled - channel fitting algorithms . however , in general , the issue of how to extract nucleon resonance content from open strangeness reactions is a long - standing question .",
    "various analyses have led to very different conclusions concerning the set of resonances that contribute  ( e.g. compare results from refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , as well as the statements made regarding the resonant set from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore , lack of sufficient experimental information , incomplete kinematic coverage , and underestimated systematics are still responsible for inconsistencies among the different models that fit the data to extract the contributing resonances and their properties  @xcite .",
    "the indeterminacy for the open strangeness channels is in contrast to the pionic channels , where the contributing resonances can be more reliably identified by means of a partial wave analysis for @xmath45  gev . in open strangeness channels ,",
    "this technique is less powerful as the non - resonant background contributions are a much larger fraction of the overall response .",
    "several groups have stressed that the importance of the background contributions calls for a framework that accounts for both the resonant and non - resonant processes and that provides for a means to constrain both of these classes of reaction mechanisms independently  @xcite .",
    "while there have been a number of publications of precision cross sections and spin observables for both the photo- and electroproduction reactions , the vast majority of the theoretical effort has focused on fitting just the photoproduction data .",
    "although @xmath33 photoproduction is easier to treat theoretically than @xmath33 electroproduction , and is thus more amenable to a detailed quantitative analysis , the electroproduction reaction is potentially a much richer source of information concerning hadronic and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the electroproduction observables have been shown to yield important complementary insights  @xcite .",
    "some of the most important aspects of electroproduction include :    * the data are sensitive to the internal structure of baryon resonances through the @xmath7 dependence of the electromagnetic form factors of the intermediate hadronic resonances associated with the strangeness production mechanism  @xcite . * the structure functions are particularly powerful to gain control over the parameterization of the background diagrams  @xcite .",
    "* studies of finite @xmath7 processes are sensitive to both transverse and longitudinal virtual photon couplings , in contrast to the purely transverse response probed in the photoproduction reactions . *",
    "the longitudinal / transverse interference structure functions provide signatures of interfering partial wave strengths that are often dramatic and have been shown to be useful for differentiating between models of the production amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "* the beam - recoil transferred polarizations in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions , as well as the recoil polarization in the @xmath0 reaction , have been shown to provide important new constraints to models that describe well the photoproduction data  @xcite .    at the medium energies of this work ,",
    "perturbative qcd is not yet capable of providing predictions of differential cross sections . to understand the underlying physics , effective models",
    "must be employed that represent approximations to qcd .",
    "ultimately , it will be most appropriate to compare the electroproduction measurements against the results of a full coupled - channel partial wave analysis that is constrained by fits to the available data .",
    "although output from such models is expected in the electroproduction sector in the future  @xcite , as of now , these data have not yet been included in the fits .",
    "thus comparisons of the electroproduction observables to single - channel models currently represent the best option to gain insight into the electroproduction realm .",
    "this analysis highlights three different theoretical model approaches .",
    "the first is a traditional hadrodynamic model and the second is based on @xmath46 and @xmath47 regge trajectory exchange .",
    "the third model , a hybrid regge plus resonance approach , amounts to a cross between the first two model types .",
    "comparison of the different model predictions to the data can be used to provide indirect support for the existence of the different baryonic resonances and their branching ratios into the strange channels , as well as to improve constraints on the phenomenology of the different strangeness production reactions .",
    "the following subsections provide a brief description of the models included in this work .",
    "hadrodynamic models provide a description of the reaction based on contributions from tree - level born and extended born terms in the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 reaction channels ( see fig .  [ born ] ) .",
    "the born diagrams include the exchange of the proton , kaon , and ground - state hyperons , while the extended born diagrams include the exchange of the associated excited states .",
    "this description of the interaction , which involves only first - order terms , is sensible as the incident and outgoing electrons interact rather weakly with the hadrons .",
    "a complete description of the physics processes requires taking into account all possible channels that could couple to the initial and final states , but the advantages of the tree - level approach are to limit complexity and to identify the dominant trends .",
    "the drawback in this class of models is that very different conclusions about the strengths of the contributing diagrams may be reached depending on which set of resonances a given model includes .",
    "maxwell _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have developed a tree - level effective lagrangian model ( referred to as mx ) for @xmath51 that incorporates the well - established @xmath48-channel resonances up to 2.2  gev with spins up to 5/2 .",
    "the model also includes four @xmath52 @xmath50-channel states , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , four @xmath57 @xmath50-channel states , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xmath49-channel resonances .",
    "the model was initially developed and fit to the available @xmath36 photoproduction data up to @xmath9=2.3  gev  @xcite .",
    "the most recent published version of the model  @xcite included fits to the available @xmath0 separated structure function data from clas  @xcite .",
    "an extension of this model that also includes fits to the available clas @xmath0 @xmath5 data has been made available for this work as well .",
    "overall the fits yield reasonable representations of both the photo- and electroproduction data",
    ". however , when compared to the results of a fit to the photoproduction data alone , the combined @xmath36 and @xmath64 fit yields significantly different coupling parameters for an equally good overall fit to the data .",
    "this indicates that the photoproduction data alone are not adequate to uniquely constrain effective lagrangian models of electromagnetic strangeness production .",
    "our @xmath33 electroproduction data are also compared to the regge model from guidal , laget , and vanderhaeghen @xcite ( referred to as glv ) .",
    "this calculation includes no baryon resonance terms at all .",
    "instead , it is based only on gauge - invariant @xmath49-channel @xmath46 and @xmath47 regge - trajectory exchange .",
    "it therefore provides a complementary basis for studying the underlying dynamics of strangeness production .",
    "it is important to note that the regge approach has far fewer parameters compared to the hadrodynamic models .",
    "these include the @xmath46 and @xmath47 form factors and the coupling constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the glv model was fit to higher - energy photoproduction data where there is little doubt of the dominance of kaon exchanges , and extrapolated down to jlab energies .",
    "an important feature of this model is the way gauge invariance is achieved for the kaonic @xmath49-channel exchanges by reggeizing the @xmath48-channel nucleon pole contribution in the same manner as the @xmath49-channel diagrams .",
    "no counter terms need to be introduced to restore gauge invariance as is done in the hadrodynamic approach .",
    "the glv regge model reasonably accounts for the strength in the clas @xmath0 differential cross sections and separated structure functions  @xcite .",
    "although the reasonable performance of a pure regge description in this channel suggests a @xmath49-channel dominated process , there are obvious discrepancies between the regge predictions and the data , indicative of @xmath48-channel strength . in the @xmath1 channel ,",
    "the same regge description significantly underpredicts the differential cross sections and separated structure functions  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the regge model fares poorly when compared to the @xmath1 data is indicative that this process has a much larger @xmath48-channel content compared to @xmath0 production .",
    "the final model included in this work was developed by the ghent group  @xcite , and is based on a tree - level effective field model for @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction from the proton .",
    "it differs from traditional isobar approaches in its description of the non - resonant diagrams , which involve the exchange of @xmath46 and @xmath47 regge trajectories .",
    "a selection of @xmath48-channel resonances is then added to this background . this `` regge plus resonance '' model ( referred to as rpr )",
    "has the advantage that the background diagrams contain only a few parameters that are tightly constrained by high - energy data .",
    "furthermore , the use of regge propagators eliminates the need to introduce strong form factors in the background terms , thus avoiding the gauge - invariance issues associated with traditional effective lagrangian models .",
    "in addition to the kaonic trajectories to model the @xmath49-channel background , the rpr model includes the same @xmath48-channel resonances as for the mx model below 2  gev . the model does include several missing @xmath11 states at 1.9  gev , @xmath67 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the separated structure functions  @xcite and beam - recoil transferred polarization data from clas  @xcite were compared to model variants with either a @xmath67 or a @xmath68 state at 1.9  gev .",
    "only the @xmath67 state assumption could be reconciled with the data , whereas the @xmath68 option could clearly be rejected . in the @xmath1 channel ,",
    "four @xmath12 states , @xmath69 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath32 , have been included .    in a new version of the rpr model ( referred to as rpr-2011 )  @xcite , several changes relative to the previous model version ( referred to as rpr-2007 )  @xcite are noteworthy .",
    "the main difference is the implementation of an unbiased model selection methodology based on bayesian inference .",
    "this inference is used as a quantitative measure of whether the inclusion of a given set of @xmath11 states is justified by the data .",
    "additionally , in this version of the model , the exchange of spin-3/2 resonances is described within a consistent interaction theory and the model has been extended to include the exchange of spin 5/2 resonances .",
    "the regge background amplitude of rpr-2007 is constrained by spectra above the resonance region ( @xmath70  gev ) at forward angles ( @xmath71 ) . by extrapolating the resulting amplitude to smaller @xmath9",
    ", one gets a parameter free background for the resonance region .",
    "the @xmath48-channel resonances are coherently added to the background amplitude .",
