    "@xcite . they found that the conversion efficiencies do not reach 100@xmath2 even for an adiabatic sweep of the magnetic field , but depend on the peak phase space density of initially prepared pure atomic gases .",
    "the ultracold diatomic _ heteronuclear _ molecule is now drawing attention .",
    "for example , there is an expectation of realizing quantum computation by making use of the electric dipole moments of heteronuclear molecules  @xcite .",
    "so far several basic experiments have been performed in order to realize this idea .",
    "heteronuclear feshbach resonances have been investigated in collisions between bosonic @xmath3na atoms and fermionic @xmath4li atoms  @xcite , bosonic @xmath5rb atoms and fermionic @xmath1k atoms  @xcite , and bosonic @xmath5rb atoms and bosonic @xmath0rb atoms  @xcite .",

    "fermionic heteronuclear feshbach molecules via rf association are investigated in a 3d optical lattice  @xcite .    in order to analyze the experimental data for the molecular conversion efficiency , hodby _ et al . _",
    "@xcite devised a stochastic phase space sampling ( spss ) model based on the assumption that only a pair of atoms sufficiently close in phase space can form a molecule through the adiabatic process . with a single fitting parameter @xmath6 ( a cutoff - radius in phase space ) , which determines how close two atoms should be in the phase space to form a molecule , the phenomenological spss model predicted that the molecular conversion efficiency is a universal function of the initial peak phase space density .",
    "the prediction from the spss model agreed notably well with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the spss model was also used to analyze the conversion efficiencies @xmath5rb-@xmath0rb feshbach molecules  @xcite , which was in agreement with the experimental data .    on the other hand , williams _",

    "@xcite provided the theory of feshbach molecule formation based on the coupled atom - molecule boltzmann equation .",
    "they derived from the first principles the universal functional form for the conversion efficiency without any fitting parameters .",
    "this approach is appropriate for the regime @xmath7 , where multiple collisions occur . here",
    ", @xmath8 is an upper bound on the ramp time and @xmath9 is the average time between collisions .",
    "the coupled atom - molecule boltzmann approach provided a result that the exchange of atoms and molecules ceases when the conservation laws of momentum and energy via the atom - molecule conversion can not be satisfied  @xcite .",
    "when we neglect the energy shift by the real part of the self - energy , these conservation laws are not satisfied for negative detunings .",
    "the detuning is the difference between an energy of the atomic dissociation continuum and the lowest single particle energy of the molecule , which is controlled by the magnetic field due to the zeeman shift . according to williams _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the conversion mechanism can be described as follows .",
    "when the starting point is the positive detuning far from the resonance with pure atomic gas , feshbach molecules are formed and decay as the detuning is ramped in the region @xmath10 .",
    "when the detuning crosses zero and becomes negative , the molecule formation effectively halts , which gives rise to the saturation of molecule production because the momentum and energy conservation laws are not satisfied .",
    "if the density is high and the 3-body recombination to form the molecule is effective , the saturation of molecule population would not appear , and the molecule formation would take place even in negative detunings . however , the saturation of the molecule population against the magnetic field is observed in many experiments  @xcite . therefore , one is allowed to assume that the sweep speed of the magnetic field is fast with respect to the time scale for 3-body collisions and only the atom - molecule resonant collisions play a role in producing the molecule in these experiments . on the other hand , the saturation against the inverse sweep rate",
    "is reported in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the saturation of molecular population with slow sweep means that the detailed balance is realized . using the kinetic theory , williams _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite signified that the atom - molecule resonant collisions alone can give rise to thermal equilibrium as well as chemical equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "considering the assumption that a sweep is slow with respect to 2-body process but it is fast with respect to the time scale for 3-body recombinations , they concluded that the detailed balance is only realized for positive detunings only through atom - molecule resonant collisions .",
    "we note that the production rate of entropy vanishes as long as the slow sweep of the magnetic field keeps the system in local equilibrium .",
    "therefore , when the sweep is so slow that the molecular conversion rate gets saturated , the process may be regarded as adiabatic for positive detunings . for negative detunings ,",
    "the chemical equilibrium is no longer maintained .    as a result ,",
    "the conversion efficiency with adiabatic sweep is determined by the molecular fraction at zero detuning , which is a function of the physical quantity of initial state connected through the equal entropy .",
    "this mechanism does not require any fitting parameters . according to this mechanism , the conversion efficiencies plotted against the initial peak phase space density  @xcite agreed well qualitatively with the experiment  @xcite , even though using an ideal gas mixture model .",
    "although these saturation mechanisms are derived above the superfluid transition temperature , these mechanisms are based on the momentum and energy conversion laws so that they are assumed to be quite general .",
    "the principle given in ref .",
    "@xcite was extended to the superfluid phase of a fermi gas below the transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "conversion efficiency against the initial temperature  @xcite including the resonant interaction agreed well qualitatively with the experiment  @xcite .    within the classical gas approximation ,",
    "the explicit formula for the conversion efficiency was given as a function of the initial peak phase space density  @xcite , which shows a qualitative agreement with the experiment  @xcite , consistent with the spss model .",
    "in this paper , we study the conversion efficiency of the heteronuclear feshbach molecule in population imbalanced gases , extending the theoretical model provided by williams _",
    "et al . _",
    "we will show that our calculation agrees with the experimental result by papp and wieman  @xcite _ without _ any fitting parameters .",
    "an exquisite point of this theoretical model is that one does not need any fitting parameters so that one can make quantitative prediction for the conversion efficiencies which have not been measured yet .",
    "thus , we investigate various combinations of quantum statistics of atoms .",
    "all combinations studied in this paper are collected on the table below .",
    "symbols `` @xmath11 '' and `` @xmath12 '' represent the quantum statistics of boson and fermion , and symbols `` @xmath13 '' , `` @xmath14 '' and `` @xmath15 '' represent the majority atomic component , the minority atomic component , and the molecular component , @xmath16 we also give the conversion efficiency as an explicit function of the initial peak phase space density of the majority atomic component .",
    "we will show that in the low - density region where bose - einstein condensation does not appear the conversion efficiency is a monotonic function of the initial peak phase space density , but independent of statistics of the minority component .    for _ homonuclear _ feshbach molecules , the trend of conversion efficiencies calculated by williams _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite was qualitatively consistent with the spss model within the range plotted in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "however , we will show that the model by williams _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite leads to completely different results from the phenomenological spss model at low temperatures , when applied to _ heteronuclear _ feshbach molecules . in the case of bosonic _ homonuclear _ feshbach molecules composed of bosonic atoms , the trend of conversion efficiency is also expected to have a completely different result from the spss model in the presence of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "although the spss model has shown agreement with the experiments so far , the problem with this model with regard to heteronuclear feshbach molecules is that the atoms of different species are disposed in the same phase space , although they should be essentially in own phase spaces .",
