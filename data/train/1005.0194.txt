    "_ delta hedging _ , which plays an important rle in financial engineering ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein ) , is a tracking control design for a `` risk - free '' management .",
    "it is the key ingredient of the famous black - scholes - merton ( bsm ) partial differential equation ( @xcite ) , which yields option pricing formulas .",
    "although the bsm equation is nowadays utilized and taught all over the world ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , the severe assumptions , which are at its bottom , brought about a number of devastating criticisms ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein ) , which attack the very basis of modern financial mathematics , and therefore of delta hedging .    we introduce here a new dynamic hedging , which is influenced by recent advances in _ model - free _ control ( @xcite ) , and bypass the shortcomings due to the bsm viewpoint :    * in order to avoid the study of the precise probabilistic nature of the fluctuations ( see the comments in @xcite , and in @xcite ) , we replace the various time series of prices by their _ trends _",
    "@xcite , like we already did for redefining the classic beta coefficient @xcite . *",
    "the control variable satisfies an elementary algebraic equation of degree @xmath0 , which results at once from the _ dynamic replication _ and which , contrarily to the bsm equation , does not need cumbersome final conditions . *",
    "no complex calibrations of various coefficients are required .",
    "connections between mathematical finance and various aspects of control theory has already been exploited by several authors ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "those approaches are however quite far from what we are doing .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical background is explained in section [ setting ] .",
    "section [ simulations ] displays several convincing numerical simulations which    * describe the behavior of @xmath1 in `` normal '' situations , * suggest new control strategies when abrupt changes , _",
    "i.e. _ , jumps , occur , and are forecasted via techniques from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some future developments are listed in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "see @xcite , and @xcite , for the definition and the existence of _ trends _ and _ quick fluctuations _ , which follow from the cartier - perrin theorem @xcite .",
    "calculations of the trends and of its derivatives are deduced from the denoising results in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which extend the familiar _ moving average _ techniques in technical analysis ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be the value of an elementary portfolio of one long option position @xmath3 and one short position in quantity @xmath1 of some underlying @xmath4 : @xmath5 note that @xmath1 is the control variable : the underlying asset is sold or bought .",
    "the portfolio is _ riskless _ if its value obeys the equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the risk - free rate interest of the equivalent amount of cash .",
    "it yields @xmath8 replace equation by @xmath9 and equation by @xmath10 combining equations and leads to the tracking control strategy @xmath11 we might again call _ delta hedging _ this strategy , although it is of course an approximate dynamic hedging via the utilization of trends .      in order to implement correctly equation , the initial values @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 of @xmath1 and @xmath14 have to be known .",
    "this is achieved by equating the logarithmic derivatives at @xmath15 of the right handsides of equations and .",
    "it yields @xmath16 and @xmath17    let us emphasize once more that the derivation of equations , and does not necessitate any precise mathematical description of the stochastic process @xmath4 and of the volatility .",
    "the numerical analysis of those equations is moreover straightforward .",
    "the literature seems to contain only few other attempts to define dynamic hedging without having recourse to the bsm machinery ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "our dynamic hedging bears some similarity with _ beta hedging _",
    "@xcite , which will be analyzed elsewhere .",
    "when taking into account variants like the _ cost of carry _ for commodities options ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , replace equation by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the amount required during a short time interval @xmath20 to finance the holding . combining the above equation with @xmath21 yields @xmath22 the derivation of the initial conditions @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath23 remains unaltered .",
    "take two derivative prices : one put ( cfu9py3500 ) and one call ( cfu9cy3500 ) .",
    "the underlying asset is the cac 40 .",
    "figures [ tout]-(a ) , [ tout]-(b ) and [ tout]-(c ) display the daily closing data .",
    "we focus on the 223 days before september 18@xmath24 , 2009",
    ". figures [ zoom1]-(a ) and [ zoom1]-(b ) ( resp . [ zoom2]-(a ) and [ zoom2]-(b ) ) present the stock prices and the derivative prices during this period , as well as their corresponding trends .",
    "figure [ zoom2]-(c ) shows the daily evolution of the risk - free interest rate , which yields the tracking objective .",
    "the control variable @xmath1 is plotted in figure [ zoom2]-(d ) .",
    "we assume that an abrupt change , _",
    "i.e. _ , a jump , is preceded by `` unusual '' fluctuations around the trend , and further develop techniques from @xcite , and from @xcite . in figure [ anti]-(a ) , which displays forecasts of abrupt changes , the symbols @xmath25 indicate if the jump is upward or downward .",
    "taking advantage of the above forecasts allows to avoid the risk - free tracking strategy , which would imply too strong variations of @xmath1 and cause some type of market illiquidity .",
    "the figures [ anti]-(b , c , d ) show some preliminary attempts , where other less `` violent '' open - loop tracking controls have been selected",
    ".    numerous types of dynamic hedging have been suggested in the literature in the presence of jumps ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "remember moreover the well known lack of robustness of the bsm setting with jumps @xcite .",
    "lack of space prevented us from          * not try to replace the gaussian assumptions by more `` complex '' probabilistic laws , * further tackle uncertainty by going deeper into the cartier - perrin theorem @xcite , _",
