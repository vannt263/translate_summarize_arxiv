    "cavitation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature , ranging from solid , liquid to plasma . cavity creation and collapse play a very important role in a large amount of industrial processes , like erosion of materials , ignition of explosive , comminution of kidney stones , etc@xcite .",
    "the cavitation phenomena may occur in a mesoscopic scale , but generally have a profound influence on the response in the macroscopic scale .",
    "as for explosives , the cavity collapse may result in jetting phenomena and consequently lead to a much higher temperature increase of the  hot spots \" .",
    "therefore , it has a potential to start local reaction leading to partial decomposition or run to full detonation@xcite . on the one hand",
    ", cavitation acts as a means of increasing the sensitivity of explosive for ignition , but on the other hand , it represents a potential safety problem for handling such materials .",
    "the interest in both considerations inspired an amount of theoretical , experimental and numerical work aiming to study the influence of cavities to the explosives@xcite .    during the collapse procedure explosive material under consideration",
    "is highly distorted and the boundaries should be tracked , which proposes a very high requirement to the numerical methods . in the early studies , conventional eulerian and/or lagrangian schemes were used@xcite . when conventional lagrangian methods are used , the mesh distortion associated with large deformations reduces the accuracy and will probably terminate the computations ; ultimately , a re - meshing treatment is required , which is not a straightforward task and generally inefficient .",
    "it is known that the conventional eulerian code is not convenient to track the boundaries .",
    "to continue , several mixed methods have been proposed to combine the merits of the two methods and overcome their drawbacks . among them , the arbitrary lagrange - euler(ale ) method@xcite is a typical one .",
    "several researchers have used the ale method to study the collapse of cavities in explosive materials@xcite .",
    "the particle - in - cell ( pic ) is a second typical mixed method@xcite .",
    "it also contributed to the research work on inhomogeneous plastic - bonded - explosives@xcite .",
    "additionally , a number of `` meshless methods '' have also been developed . to overcome the difficulty due to the distortion of mesh , the meshless method uses a series of discretized lagrangian points to construct the shape function .",
    "some meshless methods , such as the smooth particle hydrodynamics(sph)@xcite , dual particle dynamics(dpd)@xcite , etc , have been applied in the research of cavity collapse in explosive materials@xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the microscopic molecular dynamics(md ) has also brought some new understanding of the physics and chemistry involved@xcite . yet , even with the most powerful computers in nowadays , the md simulation is still far from reaching the practical spatial and temporal scales of real experiments@xcite .",
    "the physical models used in previous numerical studies are mainly fluidic ones .",
    "such models ignore many important characteristics of solid , like plastic strain , hardening , and effects relevant to the deformation history . in this study",
    "we revisit the material point method(mpm)@xcite , recently developed in the field of computational solid physics , by presenting a new contact criterion , and then use it to study the dynamical response of high melting explosive ( hmx ) with cavities under shock .",
    "the mpm is a descendant of the pic extended to solid mechanics@xcite .",
    "compared with the above - mentioned methods , the mpm provides a robust and efficient treatment of large deformation issues and a convenient framework for modeling contact between large numbers of contacting bodies . in mpm , each body is discretized by a collection of lagrangian material points carrying all information required to advance the solution ; the eulerian background computational mesh is used to solve the governing equations and the mesh solution is then used to update the information on material points .",
    "specifically , at each time step , the mpm calculations consist of two parts : a lagrangian part and a convective one .",
    "firstly , the computational mesh deforms with the body , and is used to determine the strain increment and the stresses carried by the particles . then , the new position of the computational mesh is chosen ( particularly , it may be the previous one ) ; and the velocity field is mapped from the material points to the mesh nodes . this method has been applied to handle engineering problems with large strain@xcite and/or dynamical energy release rate@xcite , fracture in heterogeneous material@xcite , dynamics failure@xcite , hypervelocity impact@xcite , thin membranes@xcite , granular materials@xcite , etc .",
    "the generalized interpolation material point(gimp ) method uses a variational form and a petrov - galerkin discretization scheme to overcome the numerical noise of previous mpm@xcite .",
    "we study not only the collapse of cavities but also the deformation and dynamical response of cavities before collapsing under shock .",
    "these are important for understanding better the ignition of explosive . the elastic - to - plastic and thermal - dynamics model with the mie - grneissen equation of state consulting the rankine - hugoniot curve is used to simulate the mechanical and thermal behaviors of the material .",
    "the model used here is more suitable for simulating the dynamical response of the solid material under shock than previous ones .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we briefly describe the generalized interpolation material point method where the contact algorithm is improved . in sect .",
    "3 the new scheme is validated by several benchmark tests and then is used to study cavitated high melting explosive . sect .",
    "4 concludes the present paper .",
    "for continuum bodies , the conservation equation for mass is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass density , @xmath6 is the velocity ,    in gimp and mpm , the continuum bodies are discretized with @xmath7 material particles .",
    "each material particle carries the information of position , velocity , temperature , mass , density , cauchy stress , strain tensor and all other internal state variables necessary for the constitutive model . since the mass of each material particle is equal and fixed , eq.([eq - pmp - mass ] ) is automatically satisfied . at each time step ,",
    "the mass and velocities of the material particles are mapped onto the background computational mesh(grid ) .",
    "the mapped nodal velocity @xmath8 is obtained through the following equation , @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass , velocity and position of particle @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is the shape function , @xmath15 and @xmath16 indexes of node .    in the early version of mpm",
    ", the grid shape function @xmath14 is not smoothed in the construction of the weighting function which causes the numerical noise as the material points cross computational grid boundaries .",
    "bardenhangen et al@xcite presented a family of methods named the generalized interpolation material point(gimp ) methods in which the interpolation function are in @xmath17(as opposed to mpm , for which are in @xmath18 ) . in this paper the following smoothed shape function in @xmath17 is used , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the length of cell , @xmath23 is given in flowing ,    @xmath24    see also fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "eq.([eq - mpm - shape ] ) is a weighting function with support in adjacent cells and the next nearest neighbor cells .",
    "this specialization has the advantage that it develops weighting function in @xmath17 with a minimal amount of additional complexity .",
    "the increased support does result in an increase in computational effort that is different from the meshless methods which invest a mount of effort to the research of the influence nodes to construct the shape function .        in eq.([eq - pmp - velo ] ) , the consistent mass matrix , @xmath25 , is @xmath26 in practice , we generally replace @xmath25 with a lumped , diagonal mass matrix so that eq .",
    "( [ eq - pmp - velo ] ) becomes @xmath27 where lumped mass is @xmath28    the conversation equation for momentum reads , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the stress tensor and @xmath31 is the body force .",

    "since the continuum bodies is described with the use of a finite set of material particles , the mass density can be written as , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dirac delta function with dimension of the inverse of volume .",

    "( [ eq - pmp - solve ] ) for the nodal accelerations , with the time step satisfying the stability condition .",
    "the critical time step is the ratio of the smallest cell size to the wave speed .",
    "after the equations of motion are solved on the cell nodes , the new nodal values of acceleration are used to update the velocity of the material particles . the strain increment for each material particle",
    "is determined with the use of gradient of the nodal basis function evaluated at the material particle position .",
    "the corresponding stress increment can be found from the constitutive model .",
    "the internal state variables can also be completely updated .",
    "the computational mesh may be discarded , and a new mesh is defined , if desired for the next time step . as a result , an effective computational mesh could be chosen for convenience@xcite .",
    "the gimp method provides a natural no - slip contact algorithm based on a common background mesh .",
    "but natural contact algorithm has two drawbacks : firstly , the premature contact occurs because the velocities of two bodies are mapped on the same nodes though the distance between the bodies may be still two or even more times of the length of cell , which may cause the numerical noise of stress ; secondly , it is impossible to separate the contacting bodies .",
    "bardenhagen et al have proposed a contact algorithm to simulate the interactions of the grains of granular material@xcite , in which the contact between bodies is handled when the velocity field of individual particles in contact differs from the single , center - of - mass velocity field in the cell containing contacting particles .",
    "a multi - mesh mapping scheme is proposed by hu and chen@xcite . in the multi - mesh mapping scheme ,",
    "each material lies in an individual background mesh rather than in the common background one .",
    "the meshing process of spur gears is simulated by hu and chen with their contact algorithm . to avoid interpenetration and allow separation in the gear meshing process",
    ", the normal velocity of any particle at the contact surface is calculated in the common background mesh , while the tangential velocity is found based on the corresponding information in respective individual mesh .    in bardenhagen s and chen s contact algorithms",
    "the premature contact may still occur . in this paper ,",
    "the criterion of contact consults the distance of the bodies . in the improved contact algorithm , if the velocities of body @xmath13 and body @xmath42 are mapped on the same node @xmath15 ( seen in fig.[fig2 ] ) , the distance between body @xmath13 and @xmath42 is calculated .",

    "if eq.([eq - contact - criterion ] ) is satisfied , the velocities of @xmath13 and @xmath42 are adjusted to new values so that the normal components of them are equal , then the strain and stress of all the particles are updated .",
    "so , eq.([eq - contact - criterion ] ) plays the role of a switch function .",
    "once bodies @xmath13 and @xmath42 contact , they move together along the normal until they separate , so the acceleration along the normal of body @xmath13 is equal to that of @xmath42 during the course of the contact .",
    "that is @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the accelerations of bodies @xmath13 and @xmath42 at node @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "they can be obtained from the newtonian second law . also the normal contact force @xmath61 can be derived .",
    "note that the normal contact force must be nonnegative .",
    "so , once @xmath61 is negative , body @xmath13 and @xmath42 is not in contact in the next time step .",
