    "it is generally accepted that the quantum confinement ( qc ) , observed when electron and hole are constrained in one or more dimensions by a potential well , is essential for the visible light emission in silicon nanoclusters ( ncs ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some open questions still exist .",
    "for instance , it is not yet known how much the qc model correctly describes the dependence of the energy gap @xmath1 on the nc size and how structure distortions and surface properties can influence the band - gap value .",
    "again , controversial interpretations of the photoluminescence ( pl ) microscopic origin in low - dimensional si structures still exist .",
    "surface effects , in particular oxidation@xcite , on the nc optical properties have been addressed in the last years .",
    "many theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite works have proved that interface properties have dramatic effects on the emission spectra of ncs . besides , the size of the nc is a crucial parameter@xcite to determine whenever such interface effects dominate ( smaller ncs ) or become negligible ( larger ncs ) respect to qc . +",
    "various efforts have been done in order to describe optical absorption and emission spectra in such systems . in this",
    "context , inclusion of excitonic and many - body effects appears to be of fundamental importance@xcite .",
    "however , until now , no work has yet tackled the excitonic problem for this kind of systems due to the difficulty to deal with a large number of atoms .    in 2003 the first theoretical _ ab - initio _ calculation considering a small",
    "si - nc embedded in a sio@xmath0 matrix @xcite has been published . in this work ,",
    "both the host matrix and the embedded nanostructure were fully relaxed .",
    "+ in the present work a more detailed first - principles calculation of the structural , electronic and optical properties of si - nc embedded in a sio@xmath0 matrix is reported .",
    "the two complementary cases of a perfectly crystalline and a completely amorphous system are taken into account .",
    "in particular , the effects generated by the surrounding matrix on the electronic properties of the ncs ( of different size ) are analyzed .",
    "the results are here compared with the corresponding ones of the free standing systems of same size .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a description of the theoretical methods and of the systems is given in section [ sec_method ] .",
    "the structural , electronic and optical properties are analyzed in section [ sec_gs ] for both crystalline ( section [ subsec_crystal ] ) and amorphous ( section [ subsec_amorph ] ) cases .",
    "the effects of the ncs size are analyzed in sec .",

    "the excited state properties described through many - body methods are reported in section [ sec_exc ] .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec_concl ] .",
    "the @xmath2-cristobalite ( bc ) sio@xmath0 is well known to give rise to one of the simplest si / sio@xmath0 interface because of its diamond - like structure @xcite .",
    "the crystalline structure has been obtained from a si@xmath3o@xmath4 cubic matrix ( of size l@xmath5  ) by removing all oxygens included in a sphere of radius 4.4   placed at the center of the cubic supercell .",
    "the results is a structure of 64 si and 116 o atoms with 10 si bonded together to form a small crystalline skeleton with t@xmath6 local symmetry before relaxation . in such core ,",
    "si atoms show a larger bond length ( 3.1  ) with respect to that of the si bulk structure ( 2.35  ) .",
    "no defects ( dangling bonds ) are present , and all the o atoms at the si / sio@xmath0 interface are single bonded with the si atoms of the nc .",
    "+    the optimized structure has been achieved by relaxing the total volume of the cell ( see fig.[struttura ] , left panel ) .",
    "this approach gives a correct description of the atomic average density in the nc region .",
    "moreover , the small distortion induced in the host matrix ( essentially due to the metastable nature of the bc ) is practically irrelevant on the nc and the interface configuration . on the other hand , relaxation criteria based on a fixed supercell volume",
    "produce , when oxygens are removed , a strong reduction of the atomic average density , giving thus not realistic results .",
    "together with the crystalline structure , the complementary case of an amorphous silica ( a - sio@xmath0 ) has been considered .",
    "the glass model has been generated using classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of quenching from a melt , as described in ref .",
    "the simulations have been done using semi - empirical ionic potentials @xcite , assuming an effective quench rate of @xmath7k / s .",
    "the glass match the well - connected definition of zachariasen @xcite .",
    "the amorphous dot structure has been obtained starting from a si@xmath3o@xmath4 amorphous silica cell by removing the 10 oxygen atoms included in a sphere of radius 3.5    placed at the center of the cell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ struttura ] ( right panel ) . the relaxation of all the structures have been performed using the siesta code@xcite and troullier - martins pseudopotentials with non - linear core corrections . a cutoff of @xmath8 on the plane - wave basis set and no additional external pressure or stress were applied .",
    "atomic positions and cell parameters have been left totally free to move .",
    "+    figure [ gr ] shows the radial distribution function g(r ) of the crystalline ( si@xmath9 ) and amorphous ( a - si@xmath9 ) silicon ncs without considering the matrix contribution , compared with that of the nc made of the 8 atoms forming the primitive cubic cell of bulk silicon . in the inset",
    "the integrated radial distribution functions are shown .",
    "we note that the crystalline and the amorphous ncs present a nearest - neighbor distance of about 2.43  , strained respect to the typical si - bulk value ( 2.35  ) , in fair agreement with the outcomes of yilmaz et al .",
    "as expected , there is a good matching between the g(r ) of the crystalline nc and the si - bulk case , while the long - range order is clearly broken in the amorphous system .",
    "+ electronic and optical properties of the relaxed structures have been obtained in the framework of dft , using the espresso package@xcite .",
    "calculations have been performed using norm - conserving pseudopotentials within the lda approximation with a ceperley - alder exchange - correlation potential , as parametrized by perdew - zunger .",
    "an energy cutoff of 60 ry on the plane wave basis have been considered . to include the many - body corrections we have first calculated , starting from the dft - lda eigenvalues and eigenvectors , the gw@xcite quasiparticle band structure using 10975 plane waves for the correlation part of the self - energy , and 20001 plane waves for the exchange part .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation has been then solved considering an excitonic hamiltonian made up of more than 65.000 transitions .",
    "the haydock algorithm has been used to solve the hamiltonian .",
    "calculations have been performed using the exc code@xcite .",
    "in parallel to the crystalline and amorphous si@xmath9/sio@xmath0 systems , three other structures have been studied : ( i ) the pure sio@xmath0 matrix ( in the same phases as used for the embedded nc calculations ) , ( ii ) the isolated ncs as extracted from the relaxed nc - silica complexes and capped by hydrogen atoms ( si@xmath9-h ) , ( iii ) the ncs together with the first interface oxygens extracted as in point ( ii ) , and then passivated by hydrogen atoms ( si@xmath9-oh ) . in the last two cases only the hydrogen atoms",
    "have been relaxed .",
    "the goal is to distinguish between the properties that depend only on the embedded nc from those that are instead influenced by the presence of the matrix .",
    "the comparison of the results relative to different passivation regimes ( h or oh groups ) could give some insight on the role played by the interface region .",
    "+       +    from the analysis of the relaxed si@xmath9/sio@xmath0 supercell emerges that the nc has a strained structure with respect to bulk si @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ gr ] ) , while the @xmath2-cristobalite matrix is strongly distorted near the nc and reduces progressively its stress far away from the interface@xcite .",
    "the electronic and optical properties of the relaxed structures of si@xmath9/sio@xmath0 , sio@xmath0 bulk , si@xmath9-h and si@xmath9-oh have been computed .",
    "figure [ bc_bande ] shows the comparison between the band structures ( energy levels ) of all these systems .",
    "we see , first of all , a strong reduction of the si@xmath9/sio@xmath0 energy gap ( @xmath1=1.77 ev ) with respect to both bulk sio@xmath0 ( 5.44 ev ) and the isolated nc passivated by h atoms ( 4.66 ev ) ; finally , as confirmed by refs .",
    "@xcite , the passivation by oh groups tends to red - shift the energy spectrum ( @xmath1=1.6 ev ) .",
    "the smaller gap with respect to the sio@xmath0 bulk case is clearly due to the formation of confined states within the nc , lying between the sio@xmath0 band edges , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ bc_bande]a and [ bc_bande]b .",
    "these states are fundamentally different from those of the free - standing hydrogenated nc ( fig .",
    "[ bc_bande]c ) . in the embedded nc states ,",
    "indeed , we find a strong contribution due to the presence of interfacial oxygen atoms .",
    "this is also confirmed by the resemblance existing between the gap values of the embedded nc and of the nc simply passivated by the oh groups ( fig . [ bc_bande]d ) .",
    "@xmath1 is thus almost completely determined by the barrier provided by the first shell of oxygen atoms .",
    "the typical behavior of the bulk dispersed states is still recognizable far away from the band edges , where the nc influence tends to vanish .",
    "the square modulus contour plots of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the two states just below it ( homo-1 , homo-2 ) , for the si@xmath9 crystalline nc in the bc matrix are reported in fig . [ hlbc ] .",
    "the supercell relaxation breaks the symmetry of the system , and consequently the degeneracy of the three states at the top of the valence band .",
    "therefore these states present slightly different eigenvalues but preserve the character of the original symmetry . in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , these states are mainly localized on part of the nc , in particular on the si - si bonds and on the interface oxygens , while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) is localized on the interface and over all the entire nc region .",
    "it is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ hlbc ] that the first shell of oxygens around the nc are able to completely trap the nc density charge , thus forming a strong barrier that is responsible for the qc effect .    in figure [ eps2_crystal ] the imaginary part of the dielectric functions ( calculated within the dft - rpa approach , using the dipole approximation and neglecting the local - field ( lf ) effects ) of si@xmath9/sio@xmath0 , si@xmath9-h and si@xmath9-oh ncs , and of the bc bulk are reported .",
    "a detailed analysis of the results allows to identify three distinct zones in the spectra .",
    "the first one , above 6 ev , where the si@xmath9/sio@xmath0 and bc bulk are very similar .",
    "the second one , between @xmath104 ev and @xmath106 ev , where a clear contribution due to the embedded si - nc is present .",
    "the third one , below 4 ev , where the transitions can not be ascribed neither to the matrix region nor to the pure nc . in this region",
    "the peaks are originated by the interplay between the embedded nc and the matrix ; in particular they are due to the presence of the oxygen atoms located at the interface region .",
    "this is confirmed by the similarity that exists , in this energy region , between the si@xmath9/sio@xmath0 and the si@xmath9-oh spectra , as depicted in the insertion of fig .",
    "[ eps2_crystal ] .",
    "the presence of oh groups thus induces a complex structure in the part of the spectrum below 4 ev that can be compared with the peaks of the si@xmath9/sio@xmath0 structures .",
    ".dft homo - lumo gap values ( in ev ) for the crystalline and amorphous silica , embedded ,",
    "oh - terminated , h - terminated si@xmath9 nc . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the difference between the gw electronic gap and the gw+bse+lf optical excitonic gap gives the exciton binding energy e@xmath11 .",
    "our calculated exciton binding energies are quite large : 1.5 ev ( crystalline ) and 1.6 ev ( amorphous ) .",
    "they are very large if compared with that of bulk sio@xmath0 ( almost 0 ev )  @xcite , bulk si ( @xmath10 15 mev ) or with carbon nanotubes @xcite where e@xmath121ev , but they are similar to those calculated for undoped and doped si - nc @xcite of similar size and for si and ge small nanowires @xcite .",
    "[ eps2_gwbse ] shows the calculated dft - rpa , gw+bse+nlf , and gw+bse+lf absorption spectra for the embedded si@xmath9 and a - si@xmath9 ncs .",
    "the results show that the inclusion of the many - body effects does not substantially modify the absorption spectra . in both cases",
    "the energy position of the absorption onset is practically not modified ( see insets ) .",
    "delerue and coworkers@xcite found that , for si - nc larger than 1.2 nm , the self - energy and coulomb corrections almost cancel each other . in our case ( about 0.7 nm ) , this cancellation does not completely occur , especially for the crystalline system , where self - energy effects dominate .",
    "+ finally , we note that the inclusion of lf contributions has dramatic effects on the spectrum of the crystalline system , especially in the region between 4 and 6 ev , while the amorphous system seems to be affected by a simple blue - shift of the absorption threshold .",
    "considering as the @xmath2-cristobalite phase of the sio@xmath0 , like as the amorphous phase obtained by classical molecular - dynamics , we have generated silicon nanoclusters of different size and shape , that are embedded in a silica matrix .",
    "the final structures , that have been relaxed with the siesta method@xcite , shows that the surrounding matrix always produces some strain on the nanocluster , especially at the si / sio@xmath0 interface .",
    "then we have compared the electronic and optical properties of the embedded structures , calculated within the dft - lda , with that of the free h- and oh- terminated clusters , and that of the pure silica . what emerges is that the electronic and optical behavior is strongly influenced by the structural properties of the considered systems ; actually , apart for the quantum confinement effect on the energy gap due to the different ncs size , the amorphization of the embedded nc is responsible for the main electronic and optical changes of the whole system . + for the smaller cases , we have also investigated the local field , self energy , and binding energy effects . concerning the optical properties we have shown",
    "that , while the many body approach provides only minor corrections , the inclusion of local fields is crucial in the analysis of highly symmetric systems ( crystalline case ) but it is of minor importance in disordered structures ( amorphous case ) . +",
    "this work shows that it could be worthy to experimentally investigate the optical properties of the matrix embedded amorphous nanoclusters@xcite , that show different properties with respect to their crystalline counterparts .",
