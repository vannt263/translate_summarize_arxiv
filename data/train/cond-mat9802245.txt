    "spin peierls compounds such as cugeo have solitons in their incommensurate phase @xcite the magnetic profile of which can be measured by nmr techniques @xcite and which must be accounted for by any theoretical model . recently a systematic study of solitons in the heisenberg spin peierls model was done by quantum monte carlo methods@xcite , with results that differ essentially from those obtained in the xy model@xcite . however",
    ", these authors did not determine the distribution of spins and the corresponding nmr signal in the incommensurate phase , which are the subject of the present paper .",
    "here we calculate the magnetic structure of solitons in the heisenberg spin peierls model via the dmrg method of white @xcite and also within the hartree fock approximation @xcite .",
    "our ( essentially exact ) dmrg results in the dimerised phase agree with those of ref@xcite and they are also surprisingly close to the results of a hartree fock calculation .    the magnetic profiles in the incommensurate phase that we compute by hartree fock disagree with those reconstructed from nmr data @xcite .",
    "however , if we eliminate the oscillations in these profiles by averaging over even and odd sites , we find spin distributions that agree qualitatively with those obtained by nmr in  ref[@xcite ] .    the spin gap peierls in cugeo and similar materials @xcite may be due to ( i ) magnetoelastic couplings @xcite and/or ( ii ) interactions among the chains @xcite .",
    "we consider the simplest realisation of case ( i ) : @xmath0 @xmath1 are spin @xmath2 operators , all energies are measured in units of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the only parameter of this model .",
    "the @xmath5 are due to elastic deformations @xmath6 the fluctuations of which are thought to be stabilised by inter chain interactions and which are treated classically .",
    "this approximation ignores the competing energy scales of phonons @xcite and magnons for cugeo ( an attempt to go beyond the static approximation was undertaken in , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we also ignored second nearest neighbour exchange couplings that might be needed in a realistic model of cugeo @xcite .",
    "the stationary point of @xmath7 with respect to the deformations @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 and this inhomogenous classical background @xmath5 is the key difficulty in tackling the spin peierls hamiltonian of eq([spinpeierlsmodel ] ) .",
    "we use the dmrg method of white in the original spin variables , while for hartree fock we use the jordan - wigner transform @xcite of eq([spinpeierlsmodel ] ) : @xmath10 as usual , the hartree fock ( hf ) approximation @xcite is given by an energy functional    @xmath11 + \\mu b\\sum s_{n}^{z}\\mbox { } \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\mbox { } s_{n}^{z}\\mbox { } & = & \\rho _ { n , n}-\\frac{1}{2 }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    plus a consistency condition @xmath12",
    "to test our dmrg @xcite and hf approaches , we consider the ground state energy of eq([spinpeierlsmodel ] ) for prescribed alternating dimerisation @xmath13 at @xmath14 . in the hf calculation",
    "there is an oscillating effective coupling @xmath15 that reflects oscillations in @xmath16 and that includes oscillations of the hartree fock variables .",
    "we find ( details are given in an appendix ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are standard elliptic functions with modulus @xmath20 .",
    "figure(1 ) displays , descending in energy , ( i ) the ground state energy of the renormalised xy model @xmath21    \\(ii ) the hartree - fock energy and ( iii ) the dmrg result ( dmrg reproduces the bethe ansatz result @xmath22 at @xmath23 ) .",
    "the dmrg and hartree fock results are close and at @xmath24 where the system decouples into independent dimers , the hartree fock approximation is exact .",
    "less satisfactory is the incorrect gap of the hartree - fock result at @xmath25 that was avoided by bulaevski@xcite by assuming the hartree fock parameter to be uniform along the chain .",
    "we conclude that the hartree fock approximation is distinct from the renormalised xy model .",
    "both in dmrg and hf we iterate eq([elastic ] ) to converge towards the fixed point .",
    "we test this procedure on the @xmath26 solitons of the xy spin peierls model of eq([xy ] ) or , equivalently the charge=@xmath2 solitons of the peierls model of polyacetylene @xcite .",
    "we recall that in the xy spin peierls model @xmath27 for half the points @xmath28 $ ] on a chain of odd length @xmath29 with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hamiltonian couples only even with odd points and is of the form    @xmath30    with a spectrum that is symmetric under @xmath31@xmath32 by the symmetry @xmath33 there are @xmath34 eigenvalues of @xmath35 plus the eigenvalue @xmath36 of the form @xmath37 which alone contributes to @xmath38 and which is responsible for the vanishing of @xmath38 on half the lattice .",
    "all this is borne out by figure 2 :     +    the magnetic profile of a soliton in the full heisenberg spin peierls model as obtained by dmrg and hf are given in fig.3 . clearly , this profile is quite different from that obtained in the xy spin peierls model .",
    "+    the dmrg result gives the symmetric profile in fig.3 and it is hard to differentiate between the two profiles .",
    "since dmrg and hf give comparable results for the spin density in the dimerised phase and since dmrg is difficult for long inhomogenous chains , we shall use hf to estimate the distribution of spins in the incommensurate phase@xcite .",
    "+    we crudely fix the parameter @xmath39 by requiring that the period of the soliton structure be comparable to that observed in the nmr experiments .",
    "consider the configuration of @xmath13 and @xmath40 , multiplied by an oscillating factor , in the incommensurate phase for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 in fig.4 .",
    "+    the nmr data reflects the distribution of spins along the chain or the number of points that carry a prescribed value of spin .",
    "the configuration of spins as displayed in fig.4 ( modulo an oscillating factor ) , gives rise to the distribution of fig.5 .",
    "we see immediately that this distribution is incompatible with the nmr data of @xcite : it contains positive and negative spins and the value of @xmath44 disagrees by a factor of @xmath45 with the value quoted by @xcite .",
    "so we are forced to conclude that the static heisenberg spin peierls model for cugeo is incompatible with the nmr data .",
    "the most plausible resolution of this     +    discrepancy is that the motion of a nuclear spin in the nmr experiment averages over the dynamics of the spin plus lattice system . to mimic such an average that is , strictly speaking , outside of the domain of validity of our calculation",
    ", we take averages @xmath46 between even and odd spins .",
    "the distribution of these average spins that is given in fig.6 is qualitatively similar to the distribution of spins in the xy model , in that the averages have one sign only .",
    "the value of @xmath44 for the distribution of averaged spins is of the same order as in the nmr data of @xcite , but the agreement with the data is only on a crude and qualitative level .",
    "we have calculated the magnetic structure of solitons in a static heisenberg spin peierls model via dmrg and the hartree fock approximation .",
    "thanks to the fact that the renormalised xy model is not the hf approximation of the heisenbergmmodel we found reasonable agreement between hf and dmrg results in the dimerised phase .    within our static model",
    ", we obtained a spin distribution in the incommensurate phase that is incompatible with the nmr data on cugeo .",
    "we then assumed that the nmr data reflect averages in time over fluctuating spins and lattice deformations and mimicked such internal dynamics ( that is beyond the scope of our static approach ) by taking averages over even and odd spins .",
    "the resulting spin distribution agrees qualitatively with the nmr data .",
    "we conclude that the dynamics of the spin plus lattice system must be taken into account in a proper theoretical description of the spin peierls transition of the cugeo system .",
