    "<S> the possibility that `` anomalous '' boson gauge couplings exist has been , in fact , the subject of a number of theoretical speculations @xcite and discussions @xcite that we shall not review in this short letter , particularly since they can be already found in excellent recent review papers @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> at least two different processes can lead to information on the same parameters , by an analysis of special one - loop contributions where the same vww vertex appears but ws ( and v ) are implied . </S>",

    "<S> it has been recently emphasized @xcite that the value of the ratio r@xmath0 would be substantially affected by those anomalous couplings that modify the zb@xmath23 vertex by virtual effects proportional to m@xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> such an m@xmath24 enhancement is present when a `` longitudinal '' @xmath25 component ( also called `` would - be - goldstone '' component @xmath26 ) is involved in a loop together with a top quark and the @xmath27 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> this already occurs in the sm and it can also occur through the operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 which generate `` anomalous '' zwh and zhh vertices . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion of ref.@xcite , to which we defer for a complete discussion , is that the shift produced in r@xmath0 by the considered model of anomalous gauge couplings ( agc ) would be : @xmath30 where @xmath31 . for m@xmath32  gev and @xmath33  tev </S>",
    "<S> this gives numerically : @xmath34 showing that this effect is , in practice , providing constraints on @xmath35 alone .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical exploitation of eq.([rbeq ] ) is obviously very strongly dependent on the experimental value of r@xmath0 , as we fully attribute @xmath36r@xmath37r@xmath38 to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> both the central value and the uncertainty of the experimental measurement are important for the conclusion that we want to draw . </S>",
    "<S> as there have been recently some changes in the experimental results we will be careful about these points . if one uses the last ( to our knowledge ) officially communicated averaged lep1/slc value , that reads @xcite,@xcite @xmath40 and the sm prediction for @xmath41 @xmath42 one obtains _ </S>",
    "<S> b^agc=0.00200.0011 and from eq.([rbeq ] ) , assuming @xmath43 , we derive a first bound on @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the lep2 constraint at 95@xmath20 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting domains are shown in fig.1a-3a ( dotted lines ) .    in order to show the consequences of recent changes in @xmath44 results on our domains we also make an illustration only using the most recent value published by aleph @xcite , which fully agrees with the sm prediction @xmath45 we obtain _ b^agc=0.00010.0020 and the domains shown in fig.1b-3b ( dotted lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> as one could expect , the results essentially differ by a shift of the domain concerning the parameter @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of the importance of the experimental uncertainty the order of magnitude of the constraints is rather similar to the one obtained in fig.1a-3a .    </S>",
    "<S> one should also note that our results depend through eq.([rbeq ] ) on the assumed value of the new physics scale @xmath4 , taken as @xmath46 in the illustrations . </S>",
    "<S> this is a typical feature of 1-loop effects . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence in @xmath4 is only logarithmic and for example increasing ( which would seem more resonable than decreasing ) @xmath4 by a factor of two would only affect the result by making the constraint roughly a relative twenty percent more stringent .    in conclusion of this first part </S>",
    "<S> one can say that the net effect of adding the lep1 constraint from r@xmath0 to the lep2 bounds corresponds to a strong reduction of the limits on @xmath35 , while the two other parameters are essentially unaffected .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm ii ) .    </S>",
    "<S> naively , one would expect that anomalous @xmath47ww couplings could affect to a sensible extent the measured value of the muon s anomalous magnetic moment @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact in the standard model , the contribution of the graph involving the @xmath8 vertex and neutrino exchange is rather large as compared to the expected future precision of the planned measurement at bnl @xcite .    to be more precise </S>",
    "<S> , a few details must be added at this point . </S>",
    "<S> the last experimental value of @xmath49 is @xcite : @xmath50 not in disagreement with the last available theoretical estimate @xcite : @xmath51 most of the theoretical uncertainty ( 88@xmath20 of the quadratic error ) arises from the lowest order hadronic contribution to @xmath49 , which is inferred , through a dispersion relation , from data of @xmath52 annihilation into hadronic final states and of hadronic @xmath53 decays . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the forthcoming bnl experiment will reduce the experimental error by more than one order of magnitude , i.e. : @xmath54 it should also be mentioned that an extra reduction of the theoretical error , coming from new measurements of the total cross section of @xmath52 annihilation in the very low energy region , would be , in principle , in the reach of the da@xmath55ne activities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the @xmath56 resonance region is responsible for more than 50@xmath20 of the quadratic error on the lowest order hadronic contribution to @xmath49 @xcite . a total integrated luminosity of less than 500  nb@xmath22 , which requires fourteen hours of running at a luminosity of 10@xmath57  @xmath58s@xmath22 ( more than two orders of magnitude lower than the expected peak luminosity of da@xmath55ne ) , should allows to measure @xmath59 ) from threshold for hadro - production up to 1.08  gev with enough precision to push down the error on the hadronic contribution to @xmath49 from this energy region to the value of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this would lead , according to @xcite , to a 30@xmath20 reduction of the error on the total hadronic contribution at one loop and , hence , to a 20@xmath20 reduction of the current overall theoretical uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can imagine that @xmath49 will be soon measured to a relative accuracy of less than a part per million . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> , the numerical value of the @xmath8 vertex contribution is , in the standard model , more than 4 times larger that the expected precision on @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that not unfairly small anomalous contributions seem to be in a good shape to produce visible effects .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this feeling is verified in a number of rigorous calculations @xcite that were performed some time ago , mostly in the unitary gauge . </S>",
    "<S> the various results produce a leading term , on which the agreement is general , and finite terms that depend essentially on the used regularization scheme and do not always coincide . for this reason , but also in order to present an alternative calculation of the gauge invariant quantity @xmath49 , we have redone the calculation in the feynmann t  hooft @xmath61 gauge within the dimensional regularization framework . </S>",
    "<S> the various technical details of the calculation are fully illustrated elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using the generally accepted prescription that sets the formal correspondence @xmath62 , we arrived to the following result : @xmath63 \\label{g-2eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is equal , in our notation , to @xmath65 .    a few comments on eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g-2eq ] ) are , at this point , appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the leading logarithmic term is in agreement , as expected , with all previous calculations . concerning the extra finite terms , that multiplying @xmath15 turns out to be in agreement with the corresponding calculation of the second of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that was performed using dimensional regularization ; this does not agree with the analogous terms computed using different regularization techniques , as exhaustively discussed in the second of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the finite term that multiplies @xmath66 , which is non zero in our calculation , would be zero in the first of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( unitary gauge and cutoff ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , this is not particularly surprising given the quite different regularization prescriptions . since for @xmath33  tev , which is generally considered as the lowest acceptable value for the new physics scale , </S>",
    "<S> the relative size of this term is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the leading logarithmically divergent contribution , we have decided to ignore it as a first quite reasonable approximation , keeping in mind the fact that , for ( unlikely ) smaller @xmath4 values , this might be a slightly arbitrary attitude . for what concerns </S>",
    "<S> the finite contribution coming from @xmath15 , we decided to retain it in a first time and to try to quantify its possible ( regularization scheme dependent ) role . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have verified , as expected , that the effect of the ( ambiguous ) finite contribution from @xmath15 is completely negligible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at least in this special example , one can safely ignore it in eq.([g-2eq ] ) . with these prescriptions , </S>",
    "<S> we have finally taken eq.([g-2eq ] ) without the finite terms and assumed no deviations from the standard model prediction and an overall ( conservative ) accuracy of @xmath67 . this constraint </S>",
    "<S> is then added to the previous lep1 , lep2 constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our analysis are shown in fig.1 - 3(a , b ) ( starred lines ) at 95@xmath20 c.l .. from inspection of those figures the following feature of our analysis should be underlined :    \\a ) for what concerns @xmath35 , the addition of the @xmath49 input has a marginal effect of less than @xmath68 ;    \\b ) the region allowed for @xmath15 which is practically completely derivable from lep2 is only reduced by a relative factor of about @xmath69 ;    \\c ) in the case of @xmath70 , a much more drastic reduction is induced by @xmath49 , numerically equal to a relative factor of about 3 ;    \\d ) the inclusion of @xmath49 makes the overall picture nicely uniform in the space of the three parameters @xmath19 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , from the combined analysis , the allowed intervals for @xmath19 and @xmath15 are rather similar and , typically , of size not larger than about 0.2 - 0.3 ( in modulus ) . </S>",
    "<S> this should be compared with the present bounds obtained from tevatron analyses @xcite that provide allowed ranges typically one order of magnitude larger .    in conclusion , we have seen that the information on possible anomalous gauge couplings that is already provided by the existing measurement of r@xmath0 at lep1 , and that will be soon improved by the current measurements of ww production at lep2 , would be remarkably enriched by the addition of the foreseen improved determination of the muon anomalous magnetic moment at bnl . </S>",
    "<S> should a deviation from the standard model values be present with a size , typically , of an `` acceptable '' twenty percent in the relevant couplings , it should not escape an accurate simultaneous overall fit . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , one should probably insist on the fact that the direct ( tree level ) tests provided by lep2 do not have the same theoretical base as the indirect ( 1-loop ) tests provided by lep1 and by bnl . </S>",
    "<S> any discrepancy between these two types of measurements would constitute a signal for another kind of virtual effects and stimulate further developments of high precision tests . </S>"
