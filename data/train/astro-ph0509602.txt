    "galaxy surface brightness fluctuations and crowding effects in nearby star clusters are two related and well recognized features one has to deal with when observing partially or fully unresolved stellar systems .",
    "the latter effect turns out to be a severe problem , for instance , when probing the innermost regions of globular clusters in our own galaxy , and more generally in all those situations when the stellar plot consists in fact of blended point sources , at different spatial scales .    on the other hand , to a more detailed analysis , even the smooth surface brightness of distant galaxies actually is found to display some intrinsic `` clumpiness '' , and this special property can be usefully exploited to derive information on their fully blended composing stellar populations , as first shown by @xcite and @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we would like to further extend the analysis of these two important issues , that deeply relates to overall characteristics of stellar aggregates and the way the latter are sampled by the observations . in particular , we will show that both effects are in fact a consequence of the same property of _ finiteness _ and _ discreteness _ of the composing stellar populations , and this will lead to a unified and more general definition of `` photometric entropy '' of a stellar population , a relevant concept whose impact on different astrophysical aspects of cluster diagnostic we want to review here .",
    "our attempt to single out any `` clean '' information of a cluster stellar population crucially relies on how confidently we approach the ideal observing conditions , that is those allowing us to fully resolve any star member in the system .",
    "apart from the obvious constraint due to the physical distance of our target and its apparent size , there are at least three relevant external mechanisms that play a role to bias our results when carrying out imagery ( or spectroscopy ) of a stellar aggregate .",
    "* directly relates to the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) of our observations , the latter being constrained both by telescope size and , in case of ground - based observations , by sky brightness . in particular , we know that , for faint sources , @xmath0 mainly scales with the telescope aperture ( @xmath1 ) , the exposure time ( @xmath2 ) , and the sky surface brightness ( ssb ) , in magnitudes per square arcsec , such as @xmath3 * is also an issue .",
    "it can be quantified by the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the instrumental diffraction pattern ( the `` airy disk '' ) , that is a measure of the _ minimum _ physical `` spot '' of a star on our imagery detector ( or spectrograph slit ) , if we could observe outside the atmosphere .",
    "the airy disk depends itself on @xmath1 , but scales with the observing wavelength , as well , so that @xmath4 * finally , , in case of ground - based observations , drastically depend on sky clarity and , opposite to the telescope resolving power , improve in general at longer wavelength , mainly due to a better spatial coherence of the atmosphere convection layers with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "theoretical arguments and empirical estimates @xcite indicate that fwhm of the seeing disk scales as @xmath6    while , to some extent , we could improve @xmath0 of our observations ( and `` see more clearly '' ) by arbitrarily increasing exposure time ( although with some non - negligible technical limits due to detector saturation , electronic noise etc . ) , the other two effects are much more difficult ( and expensive ) to be optimized , as one would need either a bigger telescope and/or space - based observations to fully remove any atmosphere contamination .",
    "the combined action of telescope resolving power and seeing provides therefore the observational kernel that constrains our ability to master the crowding conditions and fully resolve the stellar population ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "for example , for the typical case of a @xmath7  pc globular cluster around the andromeda galaxy ( about 0.7  mpc away ) a mean angular separation of the order of @xmath8 should be expected among the @xmath9 star members of the cluster .",
    "such an equivalent resolving power would certainly not be achieved by means of any seeing - limited conventional telescope on the ground , rather demanding at least a 2.5  m orbiting telescope ( as it is actually the case for the hubble space telescope , indeed ! ) .",
    "although within the limits of the instrumental performance and seeing influence ( both being , however , quantitatively assessed and , at least partially , recovered ) , one can still take advantage of the overall statistical properties of a stellar sample and gain valuable information , in any case , of its unresolved component .    in this",
    "regard , photometric entropy adds an important tool to our analysis .",
    "as we will see in a moment , its definition has much to do with the concept of `` effective number '' of stellar contributors to the integrated luminosity of a stellar population .",
    "this quantity has been first assessed in a series of previous papers @xcite , providing the reference framework for further theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "we will just sketch here some of the leading issues of the theory and the main relationships among the relevant statistical quantities involved in our analysis .",
    "first of all , it is important to define operationally what we call a `` fair statistical representation '' of a stellar population .",
    "ideally , we could assume to have a number @xmath10 of cells , each to host , _ in average _",
    ", one star to be supplied to the system through a stochastic process of poissonian nature . after completion of @xmath10 iterations , each cell will display a star distribution ( @xmath11 ) like in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and the whole system will contain , _ in average _ , @xmath12 stars .",
    "due to the poissonian distribution of @xmath11 , however , in repeated statistical realizations of the population , the total number of stars will fluctuate by @xmath13 .    if we assume , to a first analysis , that all stars have the same luminosity @xmath14 , then the expected relative fluctuation of the global luminosity ( @xmath15 ) of the sample is : @xmath16    more likely , if @xmath17 is not a constant , and distributes according to a given luminosity function , then we could still retain eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) , just replacing @xmath10 in the r.h .",
    "side of the formula with a more general quantity @xmath18 .",
    "the value of @xmath18 can be regarded as an `` effective '' number of stellar contributors in the population ; it could be demonstrated that , always , @xmath19 quite importantly , as the luminosity distribution of stars changes with wavelength , one has to expect that @xmath20    on a similar argument , the _ relative variance _ of the luminosity ( @xmath15 ) for the whole stellar population simply results : @xmath21 in the equation , @xmath22 is the `` effective luminosity '' , that is basically a `` mean '' representative luminosity of the composing stars , using @xmath23 as a normalized weighting factor .",
    "it is interesting to note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : variance ] ) is the key relation for the @xcite theory of galaxy surface brightness fluctuations .",
    "actually , one major issue of the tonry & schneider method is that , relying on the observed galaxy flux @xmath24 , one can supply the empirical quantity @xmath25 ( being @xmath26 the galaxy distance ) , to be matched with the corresponding theoretical predictions for @xmath22 from population synthesis models , according to the distinctive properties of the ( unresolved ) galaxy stellar population . as a result , the method proves to be , in principle , a powerful distance indicator , leading to a direct measure of the galaxy distance modulus : @xmath27    by matching eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) and ( [ eq : variance ] ) , a relevant physical constraint should hold ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) as : @xmath28    accordingly , from a statistical point of view , @xmath18 represents therefore _ the maximum number of bright stars , of constant luminosity @xmath22 , allowed in a population of @xmath10 members to provide the total luminosity @xmath15 _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . ideally , this statistical definition assumes a `` two - state '' condition for sample stars , with @xmath18 `` switched - on '' objects of @xmath22 individual luminosity and the remaining @xmath29 `` switched - off '' stars with @xmath30 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath18 can also be regarded as the _ maximum _ number of states ( i.e.  `` switched - on '' cells in our previous example ) available to the system , and this straightforwardly leads to a more general extension of the `` entropy '' ( @xmath31 ) concept , that in our framework can now be defined as @xmath32 or , in its usual thermodynamical notation , @xmath33 as we would better like to single out its variation within a stellar population rather than its absolute value .    according to our normalization , as @xmath34",
    ", @xmath31 is always a negative quantity , depending on wavelength and tipping at zero , in case of a `` maximum - entropy '' stellar system , where all stars contribute with the same luminosity at a given photometric band .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] , one striking feature of the @xmath18 function ( and its derived entropy quantity ) is its wide change with wavelength . in particular , one sees that for a 15 gyr simple stellar population ( ssp ) model , from @xcite , the entropy peaks around blue / visual wavebands ( @xmath35 ) , while the number of effective contributors dramatically drops by nearly five orders of magnitude when moving to short wavelength , below 3000   .",
    "a similar ( although much milder ) trend is also evident at infrared wavelength , where @xmath18 smoothly decreases by about one dex , compared to the optical range",
    ".    scaled to a typical @xmath36l@xmath37 galaxy , this means that , by looking at mid- ultraviolet wavelength , we have to expect a thin plot of some @xmath38 uv - bright stars tracing the galaxy body , compared to a quite smooth surface brightness distribution at visual wavelength , provided by about @xmath39 effective stellar contributors .",
    "the andromeda galaxy , as imaged in the visible light and by the ultraviolet space telescope galex @xcite , is a good example in this sense ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the exact trend of @xmath18 ( and @xmath31 ) vs.  wavelength is a natural output of theoretical codes for population synthesis , and it can easily be computed for a wide range of the distinctive evolutionary parameters for a stellar population .",
    "detailed values for ssp grids of models can be found in ( * ? ? ? * and web updates at http://www.bo.astro.it/  eps / home.html ) and @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the entropy level is of special importance in order to quantitatively assess the expected crowding conditions or rather the apparent `` optical depth '' , when observing a distant stellar system at different photometric bands .",
    "the latter will depend in fact on the effective number of stellar contributors convolved with the instrumental kernel ( telescope diffraction pattern plus seeing psf ) that degrades our resolution leading to a smooth nearly `` solid '' surface brightness profile .    in case of ground - based ( i.e.  seeing limited ) imaging of a star cluster , for instance , the apparent optical depth ( @xmath40 )",
    "is expected to scale as @xmath41 if , on the contrary , we are observing from space ( that is fully exploting the telescope diffraction limit ) , then target opacity will scale as @xmath42    in this framework , the difference between a `` crowded field '' and a `` surface brightness fluctuation '' is just a matter of apparent `` opacity '' of the stellar system , eventually depending whether @xmath40 is respectively @xmath43 or @xmath44 .    according to the trend envisaged in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the expected performance of our observations will therefore change with @xmath5 as in fig .",
    "in general , we see that ground - based observations are more sensitive to the observing photometric band as stars will more easily be picked up at longer wavelength , taking advantage of seeing improvement ; on the contrary , our output will not be so critically constrained when observing from space , as the lower value of @xmath18 at infrared wavelength barely compensates the poorer telescope resolving power ( compared to the visible wavelength range ) , thus maintaining the crowding conditions roughly unchanged along the different photometric bands .",
    "the previous arguments in our discussion make easier now a different statistical approach to the problem of surface brightness fluctuations in stellar systems . in particular , relying on our definition of `` fair statistical realization '' of a stellar sample ( see sec .",
    "3 ) , one could take advantage of cluster and galaxy symmetry for a different and more general statement of the @xcite method .    for example , in case of a globular cluster , like the @xmath45-band ccd picture of m53 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , one could assume that any quadrant of the system ( by centering on the photometric barycenter of the cluster ) collects a `` statistically fair sample '' of the whole cluster population , in force of the claimed central symmetry of the system .",
    "so , while , _ in average _ , each quadrant will display a mean luminosity @xmath46 , a _ scatter _ has to be expected for this quantity , according to l.h .",
    "side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : variance ] ) , simply measured as the variance of the four count determinations . in the specific case of fig",
    ".  [ fig7 ] we have @xmath47 the apparent ( @xmath45-band ) effective magnitude ( @xmath48 ) of the m53 stellar population becomes therefore @xmath49 being @xmath50 the apparent luminosity of the cluster ( i.e.  across the four quadrants , in ccd counts ) , to be calibrated in magnitude scale through the known apparent @xmath45-band magnitude of m53 [ @xmath51 , from @xcite , dereddened assuming a color excess @xmath52 and @xmath53 from @xcite ] .",
    "replacing the relevant quantities , for our cluster we have @xmath54  mag .    for the m53 stellar population ,",
    "the @xcite ssp models predict and absolute ( @xmath45-band ) effective magnitude @xmath55  mag , assuming an age of @xmath56  gyr for the cluster , a metallicity [ fe / h ]  @xmath57  dex @xcite and a blue horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology .",
    "this eventually leads to an estimated distance modulus for m53 of @xmath58 in quite good agreement with the standard value of @xmath59  mag from the @xcite globular cluster catalog ; this implies a @xmath60% relative uncertainty in the derived distance of the cluster with our method .",
    "previous application of cluster `` fair sampling '' basically relies on the claimed symmetry of the system . in this",
    "regard , our adopted 4-quadrant partition is fully arbitrary , as any other geometrical combination , like slices of fixed angular aperture , or other fixed - size apertures symmetrically located around the center could work equally well in our method .    as an interesting variant on this line , that may more suitably apply to fully unresolved galaxies , one could also consider to trace the luminosity variance along a given isophote of the surface brightness profile .",
    "this could easily be done , for instance , in case of ellipticals or face - on spirals .",
    "one important consequence of the finite luminosity sampled per pixel resolution element , along a given galaxy isophote , is that some _ intrinsic _ variance of the apparent color has to be expected , as a consequence of a different photometric entropy with varying the observing band .",
    "the amplitude of this color scatter depends on the amount of bolometric @xmath61 sampled per pixel and the relative variation of @xmath18 at the different photometric bands .",
    "an example is done in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where we computed the statistical variation of the integrated b - v color versus sampled luminosity .",
    "the b - v variance ( in magnitude scale ) derives from @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and the covariance term @xmath65 ranges between zero ( if the @xmath66 and @xmath67 luminosity contributors can be assumed to be totally independent , that is for a correlation coefficient @xmath68 in eq .",
    "[ eq : sbv ] ) , and @xmath69 if we assume a perfect positive correlation between the two photometric bands ( i.e.  assuming @xmath70 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the full variation range for the statistical fluctuation of the integrated color can eventually be written as @xmath71    quite interestingly , one sees from the figure that a detectable color scatter could be measured along a galaxy surface isophote providing to collect high-(@xmath0 ) ( i.e.  @xmath72 ) high - resolution imagery .",
    "for example , in case of a typical @xmath36l@xmath37 elliptical galaxy at the virgo distance ( @xmath73  mpc ) , one expects to sample roughly @xmath74  l@xmath37/px with a ccd of @xmath75 pixel size .",
    "this leads to a fully measurable @xmath76 scatter of some 0.01  mag ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the possible cosmological relevance of this test is obvious , as from a measure of a color scatter in a distant galaxy we can derive an absolute estimate of the sampled luminosity , to be compared with the observed surface brightness and derive therefrom the luminosity distance .",
    "following a substantially similar argument as for the color statistical scatter of previous section , one could also further expand the approach including spectroscopy .",
    "again , the change of @xmath31 and @xmath18 along wavelength is the key issue that leads us to expect some variance among the spectral features , even at close wavelength difference .",
    "a confident assessment of this effect could be extremely useful as an additional interpretative tool to disentagle the well recognized degeneracy among the evolutionary parameters of stellar populations ( see , e.g.  the long - lasting question of the `` age - metallicity '' dilemma as discussed , for instance , by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] is an illuminating example of this kind of problem .",
    "the two plots in the figure display the ultraviolet spectral energy distribution and effective number of stellar contributors for two ssps of different age and hb morphology .",
    "the models have been obtained by matching the @xcite synthesis code with the new uvblue theoretical spectral library of @xcite .    in particular , a young ( 2  gyr ) population with red hb morphology is compared with an old ( 15  gyr ) one , with a blue hb .",
    "one sees that , in spite of the striking age difference , the two spectra are nearly identical as , in both cases , we have a dominating component of warm stars ( @xmath77  k ) that emit in the ultraviolet range .",
    "however , while in the 2  gyr ssp the uv - luminosity is provided by a large number of main sequence turn - off stars , in the 15  gyr case we have a prevailing contribution from a few bright stars in the blue tail of the hb .",
    "this has a direct impact on the value of @xmath18 , with a much larger scatter along wavelength for the oldest ssp . as a consequence , in the latter case we should likely expect a larger variance ( about a factor of two ) in the measure of any narrow - band spectrophotometric index along the galaxy isophotes [ including both the popular lick indices of @xcite , in the optical range or the @xcite ultraviolet indices ] , in a way very similar to what we have shown for the b - v color .",
