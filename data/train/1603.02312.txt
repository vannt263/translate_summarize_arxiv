    "each one sided almost periodic sequence has only one extension to @xmath36 which is almost periodic , see section 5.13 in @xcite .",
    "hence one - sided and two sided almost periodic sequences are essentially the same objects .",
    "a jacobi matrix @xmath26 is called almost periodic if the sequences of recurrence coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath1 are almost periodic .",
    "we consider in the following sections only one - sided sequences due to the nature of our problems but , in general , for the almost periodicity , it is much more natural to consider sequences on @xmath36 instead of @xmath35 .",

    "there are many open problems regarding orthogonal polynomials on cantor sets , such as how to define the szeg class of measures and isospectral torus ( see e.g. @xcite for the previous results and @xcite for possible extensions of the theory and important conjectures ) especially when the support has zero lebesgue measure . the family of sets that we consider here contains both positive and zero lebesgue measure sets , parreau - widom and non parreau - widom sets .",

    "some properties of these measures related to orthogonal polynomials were already studied in detail but till now we do not have complete characterizations of most of the properties mentioned above in terms of the parameters .",
    "our results and conjectures are meant to suggest some formulations of theorems for further work on these sets as well as other cantor sets .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the previous results on @xmath42 and provide evidence for the numerical stability of the algorithm obtained in section 4 in @xcite for calculating the recurrence coefficients . in section 3 , we discuss the behavior of recurrence coefficients in different aspects and propose some conjectures about the character of periodicity of the jacobi matrices . in section 4 , the properties of widom factors are investigated .",
    "we also prove that the sequence of widom - hilbert factors for the equilibrium measure of autonomous quadratic julia sets is unbounded above as soon as the julia set is totally disconnected . in the last section",
