    "multiwavelength observations of radio pulsars are an important tool for the study of not yet clearly understood radiative mechanisms and spectral evolution of rotationpowered isolated neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "optical observations are an essential part of these studies . among a dozen",
    "optically identified nss , only seven pulsars have parallax based distances and , therefore , minimal uncertainties ( @xmath410% ) in luminosities .",
    "their optical spectra are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "a reliable optical spectrum has been obtained only for the young and bright crab pulsar @xcite .",
    "other pulsars are fainter and are represented mainly by broadband photometric points . published optical spectra of psr b0540 - 69 @xcite are strongly contaminated by a bright pulsar nebula @xcite , while a tentative spectrum of geminga @xcite is much noisier than available photometric fluxes .",
    "@xcite reported on the vela pulsar spectral observations but these data are not published yet .    in figure 2",
    "we show the evolution of luminosity l and radiation efficiency @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is spindown luminosity ) demonstrated by these seven pulsars using the data of table  1 from @xcite .",
    "we note significantly non - monotonic dependencies of @xmath7 and @xmath8 versus pulsar age with a pronounced minimum at the beginning of the middle - age epoch ( @xmath9  yr ) and comparably higher efficiencies of younger and older pulsars .",
    "owing to its relative brightness and proximity , the middle - aged psr b0656 + 14 is one of isolated nss most intensively studied in different wavelengths .",
    "it was discovered in radio by @xcite , then identified in x - rays with einstein , and observed in details with rosat , asca , chandra and xmm ( for references see @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray emission can be described as a combination of thermal radiation from the entire surface of a cooling ns and from hotter polar caps heated by relativistic particles of magnetospheric origin .",
    "an excess over the hot thermal component at energies @xmath102 kev was interpreted as nonthermal radiation from the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the pulsar has been also marginally detected in @xmath11-rays ( @xmath1050 mev ) by @xcite .    in the optical psr b0656 + 14 was identified by @xcite with the eso / ntt telescopes in the v band .",
    "it was then studied in uv with the hst / foc in the f130lp , f430w , f342w and f195w bands @xcite and with the hst / wfpc in the f555w band @xcite .",
    "detailed photometric studies in the optical - nir were performed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the studies showed that the bulk of the optical radiation is of nonthermal origin .",
    "this was confirmed by the detection of coherent optical pulsations with the radio pulsar period in the b band @xcite , in a wide 400 - 600 nm passband @xcite and in nuv @xcite .",
    "the pulse profiles are rather sharp with a high pulse fraction as expected for nonthermal emission mechanisms .    the phase integrated multiwavelength spectrum ( fig .",
    "4 ) shows that the nir - optical - uv spectral energy distribution is , in a first approach , compatible with the low energy extension of the sum of the x - ray thermal blackbody ( bb ) spectral component from the whole ns surface and the power law ( pl ) component dominating in the high energy tail .",
    "the bb extension does not contribute at longer wavelengths where the optical - nir fluxes are in a good agreement with the pl alone ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this indicates a common origin of the nonthermal optical and x - ray emission , which is strongly supported by a good coincidence in phase and shape of the pulse profiles in the optical and the x - ray tail @xcite . the same origin of the nonthermal optical and x - ray photons is likely to be a general property for other pulsars detected in both ranges , as follows from a strong correlation between respective efficiencies ( fig .",
    "3 ) found by @xcite .    in the optical emission of psr b0656 + 14",
    "there is an apparent , @xmath1(3 - 5)@xmath12 , flux excess over the pl  continuum \" at log@xmath1314.7 ( fig .  1 )",
    "this could reveal an additional , 3rd , spectral component to the bb+pl discussed above . here",
    "we present first results of the optical spectroscopy of the pulsar partially motivated by more detailed studies of the excess . in a broader sense",
    ", these results also allow us to consider , for the first time , optical properties of a middle - aged ordinary pulsar at the spectroscopic level , as it has been achieved so far only for the crab pulsar .",
    "the spectrum of psr b0656 + 14 was obtained on november  december 2004 and february 2005 during several observational runs of the eso program 074.d-0512a using the vlt / ut1 telescope in a service mode .",
    "the fors2 instrument was used in a long slit spectroscopic setup with the grating gris_300v and the filter gg435 , which cover the wavelength interval of about 4300 - 9600   and provide a medium spectral resolution of 3.35 / pixel .",
    "the slit width was 1@xmath14 and its position angle was selected in a such way as to obtain also spectra of several nearby stars for a sure pulsar astrometric referencing and wavelength / flux calibration .",
    "eighteen 1400  s science spectroscopic exposures were taken with a total exposure time of 25200  s at a mean seeing of 0.6@xmath14 .",
    "standard reference frames ( biases , darks , flatfields , lamps ) were obtained in each observational run , while the slit and slitless observations of spectrophotometric standards ( feige110 , ltt3218 and ltt1788 ) for the flux calibration were carried out in separate runs on the same nights .",
    "a combination of the midas and iraf packages was used for standard ccd data reduction , cosmic - ray track removing , spectra extraction , and subsequent data analysis .",
    "a faint , r=24.65 , pulsar is at a limit of spectroscopic capability of the vlt",
    ". nevertheless , excellent seeing conditions allowed us to resolve its spectrum even at each individual exposure , albeit with a low signal to noise ratio s / n .",
    "these exposures were co - added .",
    "the spectrum was then extracted with a 3 pixel wide extraction slit ( 0.2@xmath15/pix ) centered on the pulsar .",
    "the backgrounds were extracted with a 6 pixel wide slit centered above and below the center of the pulsar spectrum . the correction factor for the psf and sensitivity function were obtained from the feige110 standard observations .",
    "the s / n of the resulting spectrum was about 4 ( per pixel ) in the 4450 - 5500  range and declined to @xmath16 near / above 8000 , due to higher sky backgrounds and a drop in sensitivity towards longer wavelengths .",
    "we binned the spectral flux in 20 pixel bins ( 67 ) to get s / n near / above 15 and 4 , respectively , making the flux accuracy to be comparable with that of available photometric data .",
    "the binned and dereddened with @xmath17=0.093 spectrum of the pulsar is shown in figure  4 ( red curve in the right panel ) .",
    "we show also available multiwavelength data ( see @xcite for the data and @xmath17 description ) .",
    "the spectrum is in a good agreement with the broadband vri fluxes , while it is somewhat higher than the b band flux .",
    "it does not show any strong nebular emission lines that could be responsible for the apparent vr excess , mentioned above as a 3rd component , while the presence of weak features can not be completely ruled out .",
    "the continuum of the dereddened spectrum in 4600 - 7000  range has a power law shape @xmath18 ( green line ) in agreement with the nonthermal nature of the bulk of the optical emission .",
    "its slope is close to the value expected in this range from the bb+pl extended from x - rays .",
    "the slope likely undergoes a change to a positive value between the r and i bands , as follows also from the photometric data .    within uncertainties the bluest end of the optical and the reddest end of the nuv @xcite spectra are compatible with each other , suggesting a smooth connection of both .",
    "however , the f430w photometric flux in the gap between them drops below this connection with a significance of about 2@xmath12 of the flux confidence level .",
    "unless this is a result of some unknown systematics in calibration , it suggests a spectral dip in the pulsar emission centered near @xmath14300  ( @xmath114.83 in log(@xmath19 ) ) .",
    "the optical and nuv spectra and two nir photometric points , f160w and f187w , almost perfectly match the bb+pl extension from x - rays , if the pl normalization is taken to be a factor of 1.4 higher ( solid lines ) than its best x - ray fit value ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the change is within 1@xmath12 uncertainty of the fit . considering the solid line version as a new optical  continuum level \" we find an additional and more significant flux depression in the red part of the spectrum overlapping the i and f110w bands and centered near 9000 - 10000  ( log(@xmath20@xmath114.5 ) .",
    "additional spectral studies are necessary to confirm the suggested  red \" and  blue \" features and to measure their shapes and wavelengths more accurately",
    ". nevertheless , if they are real , an approximate blue - to - red frequency ratio is @xmath12 .",
    "this indicates that they can be the 1st and 2nd harmonics of an electron / positron cyclotron absorption formed in the upper magnetosphere of the pulsar at an effective altitude where the magnetic field b@xmath110@xmath21  g. this is @xmath1360 km , assuming a dipole ns field with a surface value of 4.66@xmath2210@xmath23 g , as derived from spindown measurements .",
    "the absorbing @xmath24 have to be cooled enough and provide a sufficient optical depth above a source of the nonthermal continuum .",
    "the source altitude is , therefore , @xmath25360 km and much below the light cylinder radius of @xmath118@xmath2210@xmath26 km , likely suggesting its polar cap origin .",
    "the features are broad , as expected from the magnetospheric field inhomogeneity .",
    "tentative ( @xmath272@xmath12 ) absorption features in the nuv spectrum at log(@xmath2815 and 15.1 @xcite may be the 3rd and 4th harmonics , respectively , which are fainter as the cyclotron harmonic intensity decreases with its number @xmath29 .",
    "similar , albeit less significant , spectral features are likely seen in the photometric and spectral data of another middle - aged pulsar geminga ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the absence of strong nebular lines suggests that the features are also of the ns magnetospheric origin . to explain the geminga spectrum @xcite applied a toy model of an ion cyclotron absorption at b@xmath110@xmath30  g in the inner magnetosphere of the ns combined with the bb and pl components . at this field",
    "a low @xmath29 ion cyclotron frequencies indeed fall in the optical range .",
    "however , it is likely that the nonthermal optical emission is generated in the upper magnetosphere where the magnetic field is by orders of magnitude weaker and any ion cyclotron absorption of the respective optical continuum is negligible . in this case",
    "the electron / positron cyclotron absorption or scattering appears to be more plausible interpretation .",
    "the optical spectrum of the young crab - pulsar is featureless and has a different ( positive ) slope ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the ten times older vela - pulsar has a flat and also featureless spectrum ( mignani , private communication ) .",
    "the spectroscopy of psr b0656 + 14 demonstrates that optical spectra of middle - aged pulsars can be distinct from those of younger ones by the presence of unusual spectral features or slope changes . to study this new spectral observations of psr b0656 + 14 in the nir and 3000 - 5000  ranges",
    "are needed .",
    "a question , whether the observed difference in pulsar spectra is simply caused by different pulsar geometry or by a change of physical conditions in the emission region with age , demands quantitative modeling physical processes in pulsar magnetospheres .",
