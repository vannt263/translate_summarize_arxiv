    "typically , an euv or x - ray jet begins with a rapid brightening low in the solar atmosphere , indicating an impulsive increase in the plasma temperature or density , or both .",
    "this is followed by bulk outflows of material from the bright region , usually at supersonic speeds and highly collimated in direction .",
    "these properties suggest that the plasma flow is guided along the local magnetic field  tracing loops in magnetically closed active regions and quasi - radial spires in magnetically open coronal holes  and is subjected to nonthermal , presumably magnetic , forces .",
    "the bright emissions fade away gradually as the plasma cools and expands on its passage through the atmosphere and as the energy source driving the jet is depleted . in many jets ,",
    "the outflows exhibit a distinctly helical structure in the loop or spire . within this subclass",
    ", many events also display translational bodily motions of the jet loop or spire across the plane of the sky . with or without these helical and translational motions ,",
    "a minority of jets are observed to recur from a single structure , yielding multiple episodes of brightening , jetting , and dimming that are separated by intervals of quiet .",
    "all of the above properties have been established by numerous reported observations of coronal - hole jets , which frequently are referred to as polar jets .",
    "these characteristics also have been observed , albeit for a much smaller event sample , in jets occurring in closed coronal loops ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the magnetic structures hosting these jets range in size from long loops rooted in weak - field areas adjacent to coronal holes , to short loops rooted in strong - field areas within young active regions .",
    "one example of a closed - loop jet , observed with _ sdo _ s atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) and described in detail by @xcite , is shown in figure [ fig : sdoaia ] .",
    "our objective in this paper is to simulate jets in a variety of such closed coronal loops by employing a well - tested model , described below , that has been applied extensively to polar jets @xcite .",
    "the source region of many solar jets has the morphological appearance of a sea anemone @xcite , with bright tendril - like curved loops emanating radially from a central locus .",
    "it is well established from observations that such anemone regions form as a result of flux emergence into coronal holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the photospheric magnetic field beneath the loops typically has a concentrated patch of vertical field of one ( minority ) polarity embedded within a large - scale area of generally weaker vertical field of the other ( majority ) polarity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic flux tubes that originate within the minority - polarity patch close back to the sun s surface locally , on the far side of the polarity inversion line encircling the patch .",
    "the manner in which the two polarity regions are connected depends on the free energy stored in this closed field . the minimum - energy potential magnetic field above such a distribution of photospheric flux has a dome - shaped structure with a magnetic null point near its top .",
    "flux tubes inside of the dome form closed , unsheared loops like those observed in the anemone regions ; flux tubes outside of the dome follow the large - scale background field associated with the majority polarity , closing back to the sun farther away ( in the case of closed - loop jets , as in the observational papers cited earlier and as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sdoaia ] ) or opening out into the remote heliosphere ( in the case of coronal - hole jets ) .",
    "two of our model setups exhibiting a potential null dome embedded within closed coronal loops are shown in figure [ fig : fields ] .",
    "the separation of the magnetic configuration into distinct flux systems , one closed locally and the other open ( or closed remotely , as in fig . [ fig : fields ] ) , readily allows relative displacements of field lines to occur across the null point .",
    "such displacements generate strong electric currents and , eventually , initiate magnetic reconnection and associated activity @xcite .    a prototypical model for solar jets , accounting for their impulsiveness and their helical motions by appealing to magnetic reconnection between a closed volume of twisted magnetic flux and the ambient open untwisted field",
    ", was put forth by @xcite . the reconnection transfers magnetic twist from closed",
    "to open field lines , and the twist residing on the newly reconnected open field lines then propagates away from the interaction region at the alfvn speed to form an `` untwisting '' jet .",
    "this basic picture has been the basis for numerous simulations of jets driven by flux emergence through the solar photosphere , in which a twisted flux rope rises buoyantly into a pre - existing coronal magnetic field , initiates reconnection , and launches a jet when the field orientations are favorable @xcite .",
    "this process also can form the anemone structure itself , as the observed end state of the evolution following closed - loop @xcite and coronal - hole @xcite jets .",
    "it is by no means clear that significant flux emergence always precedes solar jets , however .",
    "the fundamental susceptibility of the null - point configuration to reconnection can be exploited in other ways , as noted by @xcite . in studies of polar jets in open fields , pariat and collaborators",
    "@xcite initiated reconnection and jet onset by slowly twisting the closed flux beneath the anemone dome with applied footpoint motions .",
    "when the amount of twist reaches a critical threshold , which depends upon the inclination of the ambient field to the surface , the closed flux convulses due to onset of an ideal kink - like instability @xcite .",
    "the kink itself releases very little energy , but it initiates impulsive reconnection between the twisted closed flux inside and the untwisted open flux outside of the dome .",
    "this reconnection rapidly and efficiently releases a large fraction of the stored magnetic free energy , launching a very strong helical jet .",
    "in addition , as the reconnected open field `` untwists '' it carries the reconnection site around the dome , generating a translational bodily motion of the resulting jet spire .",
    "the reconnection and the jet flows subside gradually as the stored magnetic energy is depleted . if , however , the footpoint motions persist , then the free energy builds up again until another cycle of reconnection , jetting , and relaxation occurs , yielding recurrent events .",
    "all of these features are consistent with observed euv and x - ray jets .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the ramifications for the embedded - bipole model of jets when the ambient magnetic structure is a closed coronal loop , rather than an open coronal hole . as may be anticipated ,",
    "the behavior is quite similar to the polar case for long loops ; for short loops , on the other hand , there are both quantitative and qualitative differences in the dynamics .",
    "we describe our results in the rest of the paper , which is organized as follows . in  [ sec : model ] , we describe the physical and numerical model . ",

    "the diameter of the separatrix dome ( @xmath0 ) and the separation of the spine - line footpoints ( @xmath1 ) characterize the intrinsic spatial scales of the configuration.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we consider the simplest possible magnetic configuration for a jet - generating anemone region , in which a small - scale patch of relatively strong vertical field of one polarity is embedded in a large - scale region of weaker vertical field of the opposite polarity .",
    "this large - scale field , in turn , belongs to a bipolar flux distribution that forms a long coronal loop .",
    "two particular realizations of this configuration are shown in figure [ fig : fields ] .",
    "the topology is of the fan / spine type , with a magnetic null point atop an approximately hemispherical dome of fan field lines .",
    "emanating from the null are inner and outer spine lines that root in the parasitic polarity and the far polarity of the background field , respectively .",
    "two intrinsic length scales of this system are the diameter ( @xmath0 ) of the separatrix dome and the separation ( @xmath1 ) of the two spine footpoints . both of these lengths are easy to measure numerically , and they can be approximated from observational data as the width of the brightened anemone region and the footpoint separation of the large - scale coronal loop enclosing the anemone , respectively .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath2 of the configuration quantifies the relative sizes of the coronal loop and the enclosed separatrix dome , ranging from nearly unity when the background loop is almost as compact as the dome itself to very large values when the background loop is far larger in scale .",
    "open - field jets correspond to the limit @xmath7 , where the `` coronal loop '' extends from the sun out to the remote heliosphere .",
    "the scenarios constructed and simulated numerically for this paper were all performed in non - dimensional units .",
    "this is convenient , given the broad ranges of scales of jets and coronal loops on the sun .",
    "it is allowed due to the homogeneity of the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) model , which permits fundamental scales for length , time , and mass to be factored out of the set of variables and equations .",

    "the vertical dipole was placed below the photosphere at @xmath20 , so its depth @xmath21 , with signed strength @xmath22 .",
    "we varied the @xmath23 position of the vertical dipole from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "its orientation is such that it opposes the direction of the background dipole field at its @xmath23 position , generating the parasitic polarity and creating the 3d null - point topology .",
    "figure [ fig : dipoles ] shows magnetic field lines in the @xmath26 plane and depicts the positions of the two magnetic dipoles relative to the photosphere for the case @xmath2 = 2.40 .",
    "the peak vertical magnetic field above the parasitic polarity varied little ( @xmath27@xmath28 ) over the range of @xmath29 values considered .",
    "the parameters of our various calculations are given in table [ table : param ] .",
    "these include @xmath30 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the positive magnetic flux under the separatrix dome , @xmath31 .",
    "the peak magnetic pressure associated with our large - scale background field is @xmath32 .",
    "we chose @xmath33 for the dimensionless thermal pressure , yielding a minimum plasma beta ( ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure ) of @xmath34 with respect to the background field .",
    "at the center of the parasitic polarity , where the field strength is higher , the plasma beta is lower still , @xmath35 .",
    "the spatially varying field strength means that near the photosphere @xmath36 generally is well below unity and the magnetic field strongly dominates the dynamics , whereas high in our gravity - free corona , where the field is weaker but the thermal pressure remains uniform , @xmath36 reaches and then slightly exceeds unity . at and near the null point , in contrast , @xmath36 becomes very large ( infinite , in principle , at the null ) and the plasma dominates the dynamics , as it should .",
    "the majority of the jets in our parametric survey remain confined within the low-@xmath36 region ; however , the experiments with @xmath37 produce jets that impinge on the moderate-@xmath36 high corona . in these jets , the outflows reaching the apex of the loop bend the field lines rather sharply in the moderate - beta region .",
    "this bending of the field does not impede the progress of the jet , however , and the moderate @xmath36 in this region has no effect on the jet trigger and energy release , which occur well down in the low-@xmath36 portion of the corona .",
    "we can set the mass density independently of the thermal pressure , so we chose an initial uniform value @xmath38 .",
    "the selection @xmath39 for the ideal gas constant then sets the units of temperature , with an initial uniform value @xmath40 .",
    "these additional choices result in a uniform sound speed @xmath41 throughout the domain , for a ratio of specific heats @xmath42 .",
    "the same parameter values were assumed by @xcite .",
    "the maximum alfvn speed is @xmath43 at the center of the parasitic polarity . at the mean value across our sample of the aspect ratio , @xmath44 ,",
    "the diameter of the closed separatrix dome is @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , one dimensionless time unit in our simulations equals one characteristic alfvn time defined by these values for @xmath46 and @xmath0 .",
    "we use the adaptively refined magnetohydrodynamics solver ( arms ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to solve the ideal mhd equations in the form @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the time , @xmath49 the mass density , @xmath50 the thermal pressure , @xmath51 the internal energy density , @xmath52 the magnetic permeability , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 the 3d magnetic and velocity fields .",
    "reconnection occurs in our simulations through numerical diffusion terms in the flux - corrected transport scheme @xcite employed by arms .",
    "the lack of an explicit resistivity allows the greatest amount of free magnetic energy for the given resolution to be built up in our calculations before rapid reconnection is initiated and the jet occurs .",
    "the fct solution algorithm adds explicit numerical diffusion to the equations , and a corresponding amount of explicit anti - diffusion that minimizes the residual truncation error in smooth regions of the flow .",
    "these error - cancelling anti - diffusion fluxes are limited ( ` corrected ' ) , however , so that artificial numerical ripples are suppressed at shock fronts , shear layers , current sheets , and other discontinuities , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the effect is to introduce just enough dissipation to keep the solution well - behaved when ideal motions , such as the onset of kink instability in the case of our jet simulations , induce sudden , strong changes in the magnetic field and the plasma variables .",
    "we energize the system in the same manner as @xcite .",
    "that is , we impose a slow , subsonic and sub - alfvnic , rotation of the parasitic polarity that introduces magnetic shear across the nearly circular polarity inversion line .",
    "specifically , the driving profile is @xmath55,\\nonumber\\\\ g(b_x ) & \\equiv k_{b}\\frac{b_{r}-b_{l}}{b_{x}}\\tanh\\left(k_{b}\\frac{b_{x}-b_{l}}{b_{r}-b_{l}}\\right ) .",

    "the flow follows the contours of @xmath59 within the parasitic polarity patch and is incompressible , i.e. divergence - free , so that it preserves the vertical component of the magnetic field at the photosphere throughout the evolution .",
    "the flow speed vanishes exactly as @xmath60 , and it becomes small as @xmath61 because @xmath62 becomes small at the center of the parasitic polarity patch .",
    "we chose @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ; @xmath67 was varied over the narrow range @xmath68 $ ] , depending upon the peak strength of the dipole , to rotate the dipole as close to its central axis as possible .",
    "for these choices , between @xmath69 and @xmath70 maximum turns of twist , @xmath71 , are injected into the field beneath the dome by the time of jet initiation , as shown below .",
    "the peak driving speed on the boundary is @xmath72 , which is about @xmath73 of the sound speed and @xmath74 of the local alfvn speed .",
    "thus , the magnetic field evolves quasi - statically and remains approximately force - free throughout the low-@xmath36 portion of the corona .",
    "the adaptive grid employed by arms is constructed from a basis set of root blocks , which can be subdivided to attain higher grid refinements in a pre - defined way and/or adaptively as the solution requires @xcite .",
    "the root blocks in these simulations had a fixed spatial extent of @xmath75 . for values of @xmath76 in the range",

    "a larger domain was necessary . to maintain the same grid spacing in these calculations ,",
    "the number of root blocks was increased to @xmath80 , giving a domain size of @xmath78 \\times [ -25.5,25.5 ] \\times [ -17,17]$ ] . in each calculation",
    ", we required a minimum grid refinement of @xmath81 and a maximum of @xmath82 from the initial @xmath83 grid ( on the smaller domain ) .",
    "a volume in each simulation that encompasses the footprint of the separatrix dome , with a height of @xmath84 , is fixed at the maximum refinement level to resolve the boundary driving motions as finely as possible .",
    "the grid outside this volume adapts according to whether strong gradients , beyond a fixed dimensionless value , develop in the magnetic field ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "this adaptive refinement better resolves the electric current layers and any shocks that develop in the domain . for a typical calculation on the smaller domain this results in approximately @xmath85 grid cells , compared with around @xmath86 for the equivalent grid uniformly refined to the same maximum resolution everywhere .",
    "the larger domain required only slightly more grid cells , because the outer regions where the domain was extended were refined almost solely to the minimum level of @xmath81 .",
    "all boundaries of the box were closed ( zero fluxes of mass , momentum , energy , and magnetic flux passed through ) and line - tied ( @xmath87 except where nonzero @xmath88 was imposed according to equation [ eq : vdef ] ) .",
    "we present our results by first focusing on the differences between the jets produced in the two configurations shown in figure [ fig : fields ] : a short coronal loop with small aspect ratio , @xmath89 , and a long loop with large aspect ratio , @xmath90 .",
    "the latter value is large enough to exhibit dynamics that are markedly different from the former , while also resembling rather closely those of the open - field jets simulated by @xcite .",
    "these two cases fall near the extremes of our parameter range , which will be explored more fully below in @xmath91[sec : survey ] . the variation in @xmath2",
    "is determined principally by the coronal loop length , @xmath92 $ ] , whereas the size of the separatrix dome is roughly fixed , @xmath93 $ ] ; see table [ table : param ] .",
    "there are two aspects to the dependence upon @xmath2 .",
    "first , the explosive reconnection that gives rise to a jet is of finite duration , as is the time required for disturbances launched by the jet to reach the far footpoints of the coronal loop and reflect back into the jet source region . for long loops ,",
    "the duration is less than the travel time , and the jet generation process essentially is unaffected by the fact that the enveloping structure closes back to the sun . for short loops ,",
    "on the other hand , the duration can be longer than the travel time , and reflected disturbances can impact the jet source region before the generation process is complete .",
    "our two examples illustrate this distinction .",
    "second , the position of the null point on the separatrix dome is sensitive to the inclination of the background horizontal dipole field above the position of the embedded polarity . for long loops ,",
    "the orientation is nearly vertical , the null point is positioned near the top of the dome , and the entire dome is nearly axisymmetric . for short loops , in contrast , the orientation is far from the vertical , the null point is positioned well over on the side of the dome nearest the far loop footpoint , and the dome is strongly asymmetric . in the latter case ,",
    "it is much easier to displace the inner and outer spine lines along the fan surface , thereby distorting the potential null point into a current patch where reconnection can occur @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the reconnection is impeded very effectively until onset of an ideal kink - like instability strongly breaks the near - axisymmetry of the dome .",
    "a survey of simulated open - field jets with varying tilt angle of the uniform background field @xcite confirms this expected range of behaviors .",
    "we anticipated that our more asymmetric , short - loop configuration would form a current layer more readily and that reconnection would play more of a role at all stages of the evolution than for our more symmetric , long - loop configuration . as detailed below",
    ", this is just what we observe .    in all of the open - jet calculations of @xcite , the system evolved through three main phases .",
    "our new closed - field simulations also exhibit this progression . during the initial , energy - storage phase",
    ", the twist slowly builds in the field beneath the separatrix dome and magnetic free energy accumulates in the structure .",
    "there is little to no energy release due to any slow reconnection that occurs at the strengthening null - point current patch . eventually , a critical threshold for magnetic twist or free energy  governed by the ideal kink - like instability for the axisymmetric case , at least  is attained , the separatrix dome convulses , and the impulsive energy - release phase begins .",
    "rapid spine - fan reconnection @xcite is initiated across the separatrix , releasing much of this twist and free energy onto external , shear - free field .",
    "the untwisting of the newly reconnected field lines causes the reconnection site to precess around the separatrix dome , generating nonlinear torsional alfvn waves that comprise a helical jet @xcite .",
    "subsequently , these waves propagate away from the separatrix dome during a concluding relaxation phase , transporting significant magnetic energy and helicity away from the jet source region and causing the jet to subside as the field relaxes toward a lower energy state .",
    "the following subsections qualitatively compare and contrast the three phases of jet evolution for our two selected cases .",
    "a final subsection analyzes the rate and location of the reconnection that occurs in these events before a quantitative discussion of the full parameter study in @xmath91[sec : survey ] .",
    "the evolution of the system as twist is introduced by the boundary driving motions prior to the jet is shown in figure [ fig : buildup ] . for the long - loop case ( @xmath8 ,",
    "[ fig : buildup]a - c ) , the closed flux within the separatrix dome ( yellow field lines ) expands upward as the magnetic pressure increases beneath the dome .",
    "a current layer of small spatial extent gradually forms about the null as the dome expands into the surrounding loop flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : buildup]b - c ) .",
    "the reconnection associated with this current layer is small , and the outflows are weak , so that very little of the flux beneath the dome reconnects prior to jet onset .",
    "in contrast , for the short - loop case ( @xmath89 , fig .",
    "[ fig : buildup]d - f ) , a much more extended current layer quickly forms around the null and the nearby separatrix surface as the dome expands . the resulting reconnection links flux previously closed beneath the dome to the far coronal loop footpoint ( fig .",
    "[ fig : buildup]f , yellow field lines ) , thereby transferring part of the injected twist onto the enclosing loop . indeed , in  [ sec : char ] we will show that almost all of the flux beneath the dome is reconnected during this phase prior to onset of the short - loop jet .      in both cases",
    ", the initiation of fast energy release appears to be driven by the onset of a kink - like instability .",
    "figure [ fig : twist ] shows the field line ( yellow ) with the greatest number of turns beneath the dome prior to the initiation of the impulsive jet in each case ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 turns for @xmath90 and @xmath96 , respectively ) . also shown",
    "are field lines ( blue ) traced from evenly spaced footpoints around the contour of @xmath59 from which the yellow field line begins . because our boundary driving follows the contours of @xmath59 , albeit at non - constant speed , under ideal evolution the blue and yellow field lines should have approximately the same number of turns about the inner spine of the null in each simulation .",
    "for the long loop with @xmath8 , this is indeed the case , showing that the weak reconnection near the null has had little effect on the most sheared magnetic flux . the approximate cylindrical symmetry of the most strongly sheared field",
    "is maintained up to the time of initiation of the jet .",
    "the sudden breaking of the symmetry and onset of impulsive reconnection closely resembles the evolution of previous open - field calculations with perfect initial symmetry @xcite , and is consistent with onset of a kink - like instability .",
    "the critical number of turns at onset , @xmath94 , is very close to that reported by @xcite when the background open field is tilted from the vertical by 10@xmath97 .",
    "our long - loop configuration has an effective tilt angle of about 9@xmath97 ( see  [ sec : initiate ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] for more details ) .",
    "( horizontal - plane shading ) where the yellow field line starts .",
    "silver field lines show the field structure near the null region.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for the short loop with @xmath4 , in contrast to the long loop , the early reconnection reaches field lines that are close to the pil , along most of its extent .",
    "this acts to reduce the shear of the field lines that straddle the pil so that some field lines on the same contour of @xmath59 are more sheared than others . along a given contour ,",
    "the unreconnected field ( having the greatest number of turns ) folds underneath these less - twisted field lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twist]b , yellow field line ) , thereby contorting the shape of the separatrix .",
    "thus , the early reconnection in the short - loop case reduces the amount of flux beneath the dome that is most strongly twisted prior to initiation of the instability .",
    "it also enhances the cylindrical asymmetry of the configuration .",
    "nevertheless , the maximum number of turns attained ( @xmath98 ) is well above that achieved ( @xmath99 ) prior to the long - loop jet , while still well below that of the perfectly symmetric open case ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "this is also true of the average number of turns (  [ sec : initiate ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : triggers ] ) . evidently , the critical twist for onset of the kink - like instability driving these impulsive jets is not a simple , monotone function of the effective tilt angle of the configuration .",
    "the jet produced in our long loop ( @xmath8 ; fig .",

    "the jet produced in the short loop ( @xmath4 ) starts much later ( @xmath108 ) and is much shorter in duration ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the later onset can be attributed to a combination of two factors : a significant fraction of the injected shear has already been transferred onto loop field lines via reconnection in the energy storage phase , and more twist is required to initiate the instability that drives the jet .",

    "a large portion of the injected twist has been redistributed along the loop , and extended current layers permeate the part of the loop affected by the jet . in this case , the currents in these layers are stronger , due to the shorter loop length over which the shear is spread ( fig .  [",

    "a current layer also resides at the null in the final state .      to understand more quantitatively how reconnection across the separatrix correlates with the observed jetting behavior ,",

    "figure [ fig : rr_comp ] shows the corresponding calculated reconnection rates .",

    "once this channel is formed , the footprint of the surface rotates as highly sheared flux near the pil is reconnected out of the dome and unsheared loop flux is reconnected into it ( see the online animation of fig .",

    "the amount of flux being opened and closed across the separatrix must be equal at any given time ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this type of reconnection is often termed `` interchange reconnection . ''",
    "the interchange of a section of highly sheared field with unsheared field reduces the average shear of the closed flux beneath the dome , but does not remove it entirely .",
    "the reconnection in the later stages of the jet evolves the field towards a lower energy state that is nearer to potential , and brings the majority of the recently opened ( originally closed ) flux back beneath the dome . in the final state ,",
    "the separatrix remains somewhat distorted because the closed field still retains part of the injected twist , whilst the remainder of the twist has been transferred to the enclosing coronal loop . at this stage ,",
    "reconnection across the separatrix becomes very weak .",
    "overall , the total flux beneath the dome is reconnected roughly twice  first when the sheared flux is opened , and second when it is closed again  with the opening and closing occurring principally during the energy - release phase .",
    "by contrast , early reconnection in the more asymmetric configuration for @xmath4 opens a channel into the sheared field next to the pil during the energy - storage phase ( fig .",

    "we begin by discussing the conditions for jet onset in the different configurations .",
    "all but one of the cases that we studied eventually produced an impulsive jet , although some were very weak .",
    "we discuss the exception ( with the largest value of @xmath2 ) at the end of this section .",
    "all jets occurred during either the ramp - down phase of the driving or after the driving ceased .",
    "we defined the time at which each jet was initiated ( @xmath115 ) as the time when the rate of magnetic - energy liberation suddenly increases ( details are discussed below in  [ sec : char ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : triggers]a shows how @xmath115 varies with @xmath2 . for the largest values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the null point is nearest the top of the dome and the dome as a whole has the greatest cylindrical symmetry ( cf .",
    "[ fig : buildup]a ) .",
    "this symmetry inhibits the initiation of the kink instability that drives the jet @xcite .",
    "consequently , as @xmath2 increases the jet is increasingly delayed and @xmath115 increases . for the smallest values of @xmath2 ,",

    "[ fig : triggers]b .",
    "the former is calculated by counting the number of turns about the center of the parasitic polarity for each of the @xmath124 field lines traced to analyze the magnetic connectivity .",
    "the latter quantity is calculated from @xmath125 where the injected helicity is @xmath126 the last integral , evaluated over the photosphere ( @xmath13 ) , is derived from the @xcite gauge - invariant form of the helicity , @xmath127 here @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the current - free magnetic potential and field , respectively , for the instantaneous @xmath6 distribution at the photosphere .",
    "the normalized helicity , @xmath122 , measures the average twist injected into the flux beneath the separatrix dome .",
    "its value when the jet is initiated , @xmath118 , can be seen to match very well the maximum number of turns , @xmath119 , measured in the volume numerically at this time .",

    "the increasing cylindrical symmetry allows more twist to be stored , increasing the number of turns and the helicity injected into the field before the jet is triggered . for @xmath131 , the delayed jet trigger allows more helicity to be injected and more twist to be imparted to the field .",
    "however , the increasingly important spine - fan reconnection in this lower range spreads some of the injected helicity along the coronal loop and restricts the strongly twisted field lines to a smaller portion of the flux beneath the dome (  [ sec : recon1 ] ) .",
    "the helicity eventually plateaus at small @xmath2 , whilst the number of turns peaks and then declines again as the reconnection penetrates farther toward the pil .",
    "the turn values that we measured lie within the range @xmath132 $ ] , somewhat below the 1.4 turns required for the initiation of the kink instability in open - field configurations with perfect initial symmetry @xcite and consistent with the 0.8 turns required in a setup with a tilted background field @xcite .",
    "this supports our interpretation that the impulsive energy - release phase is driven by the onset of a kink - like instability .",
    "similar results for the variation in jet trigger times for magnetically open configurations have been presented by @xcite .",
    "they investigated the influence of the inclination angle of a straight , uniform , open background field on the initiation and evolution of jets .",
    "their simulations showed the same two effects governing the trigger time of open jets : the kink instability of the twisted field , which occurs later in configurations with more vertical background fields and greater cylindrical symmetry ; and spine - fan reconnection across the separatrix , which lowers the rate of energy storage beneath the dome and delays the jet in configurations with more horizontal background fields and greater dome asymmetry .",
    "the shortest trigger time occurred for an intermediate inclination angle of the field .    however , there are two important differences between those open - field investigations and our closed - field simulations .",
    "first , our background magnetic field falls off with height above the photosphere .",
    "consequently , the separatrix domes in our simulations expand essentially vertically ( cf .  figs .",
    "[ fig : buildup]c , f ) , rather than along the direction of the uniform background field as occurs in the open cases .",
    "second , as the dome expands into the closed loop , the tilt angle of the background field at the null increases as the field drapes over the dome .",
    "this generates a strengthening non - axisymmetric current layer at the null in all configurations , leading to initially weak reconnection outflows that increase as the dome expands .",
    "therefore , there is no completely axisymmetric configuration as can be achieved in the open - field case , where reconnection is geometrically inhibited during the buildup phase .",
    "given these differences , it is not surprising that the trigger - time - minimizing angle in our simulations differs from the @xmath133 tilt angle identified by @xcite .",
    "although the effective inclination angle in our simulations changes with time , a rough estimate of the initial angle ( @xmath134 ) can be obtained by using the null position relative to the center of the parasitic polarity at @xmath135 .",
    "this is a close approximation to the angle of the spine lines near the null , and is equivalent to the angle of the straight background field in open configurations .",
    "an approximately inverse linear relationship between @xmath134 and @xmath2 is found , as shown in figure [ fig : theta ] . the aspect ratio that minimizes the jet trigger time for our closed jets , @xmath116 , corresponds to a relatively steep inclination angle , @xmath136 .    :",
    "inclination angle , @xmath134.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we conclude this subsection by discussing briefly our longest - loop configuration ( @xmath137 ) , which remained stable and did not produce an impulsive jet .",
    "this case is most cylindrically symmetric , with the null point remaining near the top of the dome throughout the simulation .",
    "the number of injected turns ( @xmath138 ) was less than the critical amount ( @xmath139 ) needed to set off the kink instability in an open field with zero inclination angle .",
    "draping of field lines , mentioned above , formed a thin current layer surrounding the single null point .",
    "the reconnection associated with this current layer was very weak , did not reach the sheared field beneath the dome , and did not destabilize the configuration .",
    "we ran this simulation @xmath140 time units past the end of the driving period , during which time the magnetic field relaxed and reconnection within the current layer tapered off almost entirely .",
    "the final state contains a current layer around the null and , evidently , is stable .",
    "we now consider the energetics of our jets . because each configuration has a slightly different magnetic flux and peak field strength associated with the parasitic polarity , the energy injected by the boundary driving is different in each case . the total energy injected into the magnetic field by the footpoint motions up to time @xmath48 is calculated by integrating the poynting flux across the bottom boundary : @xmath141 to compare the runs equitably , we normalize the various energies with respect to the total energy injected into the volume by the footpoint motions in each case , @xmath142 .",

    "early in each simulation , essentially all of the injected energy is stored in the coronal magnetic field , as very little is converted to kinetic or thermal energy of the plasma . because the component of the magnetic field normal to the photosphere is held fixed throughout each run , the current - free field @xmath144 and its energy @xmath145 also are independent of time .",

    "the transition in behavior around @xmath156 , from jets preceded by significant reconnection in the energy buildup phase to jets with relatively little , is evident in the magnetic energy curves . in figure",
    "[ fig : emag]a , the injected energy closely matches the free magnetic energy prior to the jet ( @xmath157 ) for configurations with @xmath158 ( dashed lines ) , due to the weak reconnection occurring in this phase . correspondingly , the liberated energy @xmath153 is small until the onset of the impulsive phase of these jets , when large increases in @xmath153 are evident ( fig .",

    "also are reflected in the durations of the jets and in the associated peak kinetic energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flows]a , b ) .",

    "the duration almost triples in length , from @xmath172 to @xmath173 , with a steep transition around @xmath156 ( fig .",

    "the travel time increases , but this is mediated in part by the increase in jet duration . by inspection , we find that jets with @xmath174 are relatively unaffected by reflections from the far loop footpoints , although they do exhibit counterstreaming flows in the loop .",

    "a possible manifestation of this was described by @xcite , who observed counterstreaming flows in h@xmath3 loops in an active region at the same time that flaring and jetting were observed in a mixed - polarity region at one end of the loop system .",

    "@xcite described soft x - ray emission spread along short coronal loops where the estimated travel time was shorter than the jet lifetime , lending some credence to this idea .",
    "as in open - field regions , closed - field jets sometimes are generated repeatedly from the same source region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the free energy that drives the jets in our model arose from boundary motions , applied on the photosphere , which were stopped once a single jet was produced .",

    "there , we can assume @xmath187 , hence the strengths of the coronal - loop ( @xmath188 ) and parasitic - polarity ( @xmath189 ) fields are @xmath190 the pressure scale factor @xmath191 , so the thermal pressure ( @xmath192 ) is @xmath193 at a temperature of @xmath194 k , the corresponding mass density is @xmath195 hence , in quiet sun we set @xmath196 , which together with @xmath187 gives @xmath197 .",

    "typical velocities within our main curtain - like spray were somewhat lower , with dimensionless values @xmath105 , scaling to @xmath200 cm s@xmath201 .",
    "this falls within the ranges of velocities reported by @xcite and @xcite , and is consistent with the jet speeds reported by @xcite .",
    "finally , a length scale factor @xmath202 applied to our average dimensionless loop length gives a coronal value @xmath203 for this long coronal loop , the remaining scale factors are @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 .",
    "using values from table [ table : param ] for the typical jet duration , peak kinetic energy , and peak reconnection rate we obtain , respectively , @xmath207 the duration of our quiet - sun jet is roughly the mean of the large range of jet lifetimes reported by @xcite ( @xmath208@xmath209 s ) and is at the high end of the range reported by @xcite ( @xmath208@xmath210 s ) .",
    "its kinetic energy is near the upper end of the range reported by @xcite ( @xmath211 erg ) .",
    "the reconnection rate varies from about @xmath212 mx s@xmath201 during the early , slow - reconnection ( energy - storage ) phase to @xmath213 mx s@xmath201 during the impulsive , fast - reconnection ( energy - release ) phase of the jets .    for jets occurring in active regions ( @xmath214 ) , we set @xmath215",
    ". the strengths of the coronal - loop ( @xmath188 ) and parasitic - polarity ( @xmath189 ) fields then are @xmath216 the pressure scale factor @xmath217 , so now the thermal pressure is @xmath218 here , the corresponding mass density is @xmath219 we therefore set @xmath220 , which together with @xmath215 again gives @xmath197 .",
    "thus , as in quiet sun we find @xmath221 here , we assume a length scale factor @xmath222 to model jets in compact active - region loops , @xmath223 the rest of the scale factors are @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and ( as before ) @xmath206 .",
    "for the typical jet duration , peak kinetic energy , and peak reconnection rate we obtain , respectively , @xmath226 the duration of our active - region jet is at the low end of the range of jet lifetimes reported by @xcite and @xcite , and somewhat shorter than the observed jet shown in figure [ fig : sdoaia ] .",
    "its kinetic energy is near the mean of the range reported by @xcite ( @xmath227  @xmath228 erg ) .",
    "the reconnection rate varies over the same range as in quiet sun , @xmath212 mx s@xmath201 to @xmath213 mx s@xmath201 .",
    "we have investigated the initiation and evolution of solar jets in closed coronal loops via three - dimensional numerical simulations of the embedded - bipole model @xcite , which has been investigated extensively to explain coronal - hole jets @xcite . as in those prior studies ,",
    "our impulsive jets consist of twisted , curtain - like outflows that exhibit strong helical motions and filamentary structure , resembling observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the variation in loop cross - section with distance along the loop , our jets",
    "expand and then contract laterally as they propagate along the loop toward its far footpoint , as observed . by scaling our dimensionless results using typical input parameters characterizing coronal jet sources @xcite",
    ", we obtain values for the jet speeds , durations , and energies that are consistent with those observed (  [ sec : obs2 ] ) .",
    "our results further show that the evolution is highly sensitive to the relative sizes of the closed dome ( @xmath0 ) of the jet source region and the coronal loop ( @xmath1 ) within which the source is embedded .",
    "we found that configurations with large @xmath2 ratios store the greatest amount of magnetic free energy and produce the longest - duration , most energetic jets ; those with small @xmath2 ratios release a significant fraction of the injected free energy prior to onset of their shorter - duration , less energetic jets .",
    "the transition between these behaviors occurs at @xmath116 , where the number of turns of induced twist required to initiate the impulsive jet is minimized ( fig .",
    "[ fig : triggers]b ) .",
    "smaller configurations liberate up to 20% of the stored free energy prior to jet onset ; larger ones liberate essentially none ( fig .",
    "[ fig : emag]d ) .",
    "these energies reflect amounts of cumulative reconnected flux prior to onset of as much as 100% and as little as 10% , respectively , of the total flux enclosed beneath the dome ( fig .",
    "[ fig : recon]b ) . during the fast reconnection that drives the impulsive jet , in contrast , the liberated energy ranges from less than 10% for small @xmath2 to as much as 60% for large @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : emag]d ) , and the reconnected flux ranges from as little as 30% to as much as 200% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : recon]b ) .",
    "the corresponding jet durations range from fewer than 100 to more than 300 alfvn times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flows]a ) . finally , the kinetic energies in the jet flow , normalized to the total injected energy , range smoothly from essentially zero at @xmath229 to about 5% at @xmath230 , and then rise at a more rapid pace toward higher @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flows]b ) . in configurations with @xmath231 ,",
    "the reconnection driving the impulsive jet ceases before the jet flow reaches the far footpoint of the loop and reflects back into the jet source region . in configurations with @xmath232 ,",
    "on the other hand , the counterstreaming forward and backward ( reflected ) jet flows interfere strongly with each other ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jets ] ) , and even appear to choke off the reconnection outflow in our most compact configurations .",
    "following the cessation of the impulsive reconnection and subsidence of the principal jet outflows , our system relaxes toward a new quasi - steady state with filamentary current structures threading the coronal loop .",
    "these structures arise from a local mismatch of neighboring flux - tube lengths , driven by the spatially and temporally intermittent transfer of twist to the loop during the three - dimensional evolution : reconnection - driven current filamentation @xcite . at higher grid resolution",
    ", these currents should become even more filamentary in structure and greater in strength , and could produce quasi - steady heating of the loop in the aftermath of the jet .",
    "in addition , it is known that 3d null - point current layers are explosively unstable to resistive tearing at high lundquist numbers @xcite . attaining the requisite lundquist - number threshold demands better resolution than the simulations undertaken in this work .",
    "sufficiently high - resolution simulations also should reveal more fine structure in the jet itself , plausibly including the formation and ejection of small - scale plasma concentrations (  blobs  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the jet outflow .",
    "these intriguing possibilities are being evaluated in our ongoing study of coronal loop jets .",
    "this work was supported by p.f.w.s appointment to the nasa postdoctoral program , administered by oak ridge associated universities through a contract with nasa , and by c.r.d.s participation with a nasa living with a star focused science team on solar jets .",
    "the computer resources used to perform the numerical simulations were provided to c.r.d . by nasa s high - end computing program at the nasa center for climate simulation .",
    "[ fig : sdoaia ] and its animation were created using the esa and nasa funded helioviewer project .",
    "we are grateful to our colleagues spiro antiochos , judy karpen , etienne pariat , and kevin dalmasse for numerous helpful discussions on the topic of solar jets , to david pontin for ongoing discussions and insight regarding three - dimensional reconnection , and to our anonymous referee for suggesting clarifying changes to the original manuscript .",
    "to calculate the reconnection rate in our simulations we take advantage of the fact that there is a true separatrix surface across which the rate of flux transfer may be measured . in each of the simulations the boundary driving is localized within the circular polarity inversion line so that near the separatrix the field line footpoints are line tied and fixed in position .",
    "any change in the position of the separatrix is therefore due to reconnection occurring within the volume . since the driven ends of the closed field lines always remain beneath the dome we can ignore the fact that these field lines are moving relative to the position of the starting grid from which the field lines are traced .",
    "we calculate the instantaneous reconnection rate in the following manner . for each field line in our tracing grid",
    "we assigned a magnetic flux element @xmath233 where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the separation of the starting positions in the grid and @xmath236 is the magnetic field normal to the photosphere at this position . at each time",
    "we compare the connectivity of each field line with the previous time .",
    "the flux elements of all the field lines which have been `` opened '' and `` closed '' in this time interval are summed to give the total opened and closed flux respectively @xmath237 to a high degree of accuracy in each of our simulations , the opened flux matched the closed flux .",
    "the reconnection rate is taken to be the simple average @xmath238 here @xmath239 is the average time of evaluation and @xmath240 is the time increment .",
    "the flux reconnected up to any time @xmath241 is the sum @xmath242"
