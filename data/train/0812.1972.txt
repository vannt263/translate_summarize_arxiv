    "the canonical thermodynamic model ( ctm ) as applied to the nuclear multifragmentation problem addresses the following scenario .",
    "assume that because of collisions we have a finite piece of nuclear matter which is heated and begins to expand .",
    "during the expansion the nucleus will break up into many fragments(composites ) . in the expanded volume ,",
    "the nuclear interaction between different composites can be neglected and the long range coulomb force can be absorbed in a suitable approximation .",
    "the partitioning of this hot piece of matter according to the availability of phase space can be calculated exactly ( but numerically ) in ctm .",
    "many applications of this model have been made and compared to experimental data @xcite .",
    "the model is very similar to the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) developed in copenhagen @xcite .",
    "smm is more general but requires complicated monte - carlo simulations . in typical physical situations",
    "the two models give very similar results @xcite .    in usual situations ,",
    "the piece of nuclear matter has neutrons and protons , that is , it is a two - component system .",
    "initially ctm was formulated for one kind of particle @xcite and already many interesting properties like phase transition could be studied .",
    "subsequent to the extension of ctm to two kinds of particles @xcite , many applications of the model to compare with experimental data were made @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to extend ctm to three - component systems .",
    "while this , in general , is interesting , it can also be useful for calculations in an area of current interest .",
    "i refer here to the production of hyperons ( usually @xmath0 ) in heavy ion reaction in the 1gev / a to 2 gev / a beam energy range .",
    "the @xmath0 s can get attached to nuclei turning them into composites with three species .",
    "the conventional thinking is this .",
    "the @xmath0 particle is produced in the participating zone , i.e. , the region of violent collisions .",
    "the produced @xmath0 s have an extended rapidity distribution and some of these can be absorbed in the much colder specator parts .",
    "these will form hypernuclei .",
    "those absorbed in the projectile fragment ( plf ) can be more easily studied experimentally because they emerge in the forward direction .",
    "this idea has been recently used to study the production of hypernuclei in a recent paper using the smm model @xcite .",
    "our work closely follows the same physics , however , using a different and what we believe a much easier prescription .",
    "in addition our focus is different and we emphasize other aspects .",
    "the question of hypernucleus production in heavy ion reaction was already looked at in detail more than twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "the authors used a coalescence model . both the break up of a plf into composites and the absorption of the @xmath0 used coalescence .",
    "the coalescence approach has been revived in a much more ambitious calculation recently @xcite .",
    "intuitively the coalescence model is appealing but for a satisfactory formulation of the plf breaking up into many composites there are many very difficult details which need to be worked out .",
    "certainly there are some points of similarities between the thermodynamic model for multifragmentation and production of composites by coalescence . for the production of the deuteron , the simplest composite ,",
    "the two models were compared @xcite .",
    "but that study also shows that for a heavier fragment ( say @xmath2c ) the two routes become impossible to disentangle from each other . however , there is at least one argument in favour of the thermodynamic model ( both smm and ctm ) .",
    "they have been widely used for composite production and enjoyed very good success @xcite .",
    "the physics ansatz for the calculation reported in the earlier work @xcite and the prersent work is the same .",
    "the @xmath0 particle ( particles ) which arrive at the plf interact strongly with the nucleons .",
    "thus fragments can be calculated as in normal prescriptions .",
    "hypernuclei as well as normal ( non - strange ) composites will be formed .",
    "the model gives definitive predictions as the following sections will show .",
    "experiments can vindicate or contradict these predictions .",
    "the case ot two - component system ( neutrons and protons ) have been dealt with in many places including @xcite .",
    "the generalisation to three components is straightforward .",
    "the multifragmentation of the system we study has a given number of baryons @xmath3 , charges @xmath4 and strangeness number @xmath5 .",
    "this will break up into composites with mass @xmath6 , charge @xmath7 and @xmath8 number of @xmath0 particles .",
    "the canonical partition function of the system @xmath9 is given by the following equation .",
    "once the partition function is known , observables can be calculated .",
    "@xmath10 here @xmath11 is the partition function of one composite which has mass number @xmath6 , charge number @xmath7 and @xmath8 hyperons ( here @xmath0 s ) and @xmath12 is the number of such composites in a given channel .",
    "the sum over channels in eq.(1 ) is very large and each channel must satisfy @xmath13 proceeding further , we have @xmath14 which readily leads to @xmath15 since @xmath16 we have @xmath17 which immediately leads to a recuurence relation which can be used to calculate the many particle partition function : @xmath18 it is obvious other formulae similar to the one above exist : @xmath19 the above equations are general . in this paper",
    "we do numerical calculations for the cases @xmath5=1 and @xmath5=2 .",
    "the composites considered have either @xmath8=0 ( non - strange composites ) or @xmath8=1 . for the case",
    "@xmath5=2 this means that in a given channel there will be two composites each with @xmath8=1 .",
    "a more general treatment would include composites with two @xmath0 s . to complete the story",
    "we need to write down the specific expressions for @xmath11 that we use .",
    "the one particle partition function is a product two parts : @xmath20 the kinetic part is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass of the composite : @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the nucleon mass ( we use 938 mev ) and @xmath25 is the @xmath0 mass ( we use 1116 mev ) .",
    "for low mass nuclei , we use experimental values to construct @xmath26 and for higher masses a liquid - drop formula is used .",
    "the neutron , proton and @xmath0 particle are taken as fundamental blocks and so @xmath27 ( spin degeracy ) .",
    "for deuteron , triton , @xmath28he and @xmath29he we use @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ground state energy and @xmath32 is the experimental spin degeneracy of the ground stste .",
    "contributions to the @xmath26 from excited states are left out for these low mass nuclei .",
    "similarly experimental data are used for @xmath33h , @xmath34h , @xmath34he and @xmath35he .    for heavier nuclei ( @xmath8=0 or 1 ) , a liquid - drop formula is used for ground state energy .",
    "this formula is taken from @xcite .",
    "all energies are in mev .",
    "@xmath36 here @xmath37 is temperature dependent surface tension : @xmath38^{5/4}$ ]",
    ". a comparative study of the above binding energy formula can be found in @xcite .",
    "this formula also defines the drip lines .",
    "we include all nuclei within drip lines in constructing the partition function .    with the liquid - drop formula",
    "we also include the contribution to @xmath39 coming from the excited states .",
    "this gives a multiplicative factor @xmath40 where we have introduced a correction term @xmath41 to the expression used in @xcite .",
    "this slows down the increase of @xmath39 due to excited states as @xmath42 increases .",
    "reasons for this correction can be found in @xcite although for the temperature range used in this paper the correction is not important .",
    "we also incorporate the effects of the long - range coulomb force in the wigner - seitz approximation @xcite .",
    "we have used eq.(7 ) to compute the partrition functions . if the plf which absorbs the @xmath0 has mass number @xmath3 and proton number @xmath4 , we first calculate all the relevant partion functions for @xmath5=0 first .",
    "this requires calculating upto @xmath43 .",
    "we then calculate , for @xmath5=1 partition functions upto @xmath44",
    ". we can then proceed to calculate for @xmath5=2 upto @xmath45 and so on .",
    "we assume one @xmath0 is captured in the projectile like fragment ( plf ) .",
    "the plf breaks up into various fragments . in an event one of these fragments",
    "will contain the @xmath0 particle , the rest of the fragments will have @xmath46 .",
    "there is also a probability that the @xmath0 remains unattached , i.e. , after break - up it emerges as a free @xmath0 .",
    "there is also another extreme possibility ( this requires very low temperature in the plf ) that the @xmath0 gets attached to the entire plf which does not break up .",
    "in such an event the number of composites with @xmath46 is zero .",
    "the average over all events give the average multiplicity of all composites , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( eq.(4 ) ) .",
    "we will show results for @xmath0 captured by a system of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these are the same systems considered in @xcite . the results for @xmath50 depend quite sensitively on the temperature and less so on the assumed freeze - out density .",
    "except in one case , all the results shown use freeze - out density to be one - third normal density .",
    "past experiences have shown @xcite that a freeze - out density of one - third normal density gives better results for disassebly of plf than , for example , the value of one - sixth normal density which is more appropriate for the participating zone . again from past experiences , temperatures in the range 5 to 10 mev are considered to be appropriate .    in fig.1",
    "we show results for @xmath48 at a low temperature of @xmath42=4 mev . in order to display the results",
    "easily we sum over the charge and plot @xmath51 .",
    "note that for this choice of temperature , the average mass number of the hypernucleus formed is very high , about 95 .",
    "the multiplicity of non - strange composites is low ( 1.24 ) .",
    "the average mass of non - strange composite is about 5 and the average charge is about 1.7 .",
    "we thus have a curious situation .",
    "the non - strange part is a gas with very few particles and the strange part of matter is a liquid since in heavy ion physics , a large blob of matter is attributed to be the liquid part . while this aspect of hybrid liquid - gas co - existence may lead to an interesting study",
    ", our focus here will be the population of hypernuclei .    for brevity we do not show the population of composites at this temperature for a system of @xmath49 .",
    "there are remarkable similarities in the shapes of the the curves , but the differences are also significant and the curve for @xmath52 can not be scaled onto the curve for @xmath3=100 . at higher temperature , however , one can guess the results for @xmath52 knowing , for example , the results for @xmath3=100 .",
    "2 shows the graph of @xmath53 at 8 mev temperature for both @xmath48 and the system double its size .",
    "the important feature which allows one to scale the results of one system to another is this . at this temperature the relative population of @xmath53 drops off rapidly with @xmath6 so that the population beyond , say , @xmath6=40 can be ignored . for compsites with @xmath8=1 ,",
    "both the systems @xmath54 and @xmath3=200 are virtually the same : for both , @xmath55 and hence it is possible to have the same value of @xmath56 for the the two systems . the graphs for @xmath47 bear this out .",
    "but for @xmath46 , @xmath57 have to add up to different numbers .",
    "for @xmath54 they have to add up to @xmath58)$ ] and for @xmath52 they have to add up to @xmath59/$ ] .",
    "the simplest ansatz is that @xmath56 for @xmath3=200 is larger than the corresponding quantity for @xmath54 by the ratio @xmath59/[101-\\langle a(h=1)\\rangle]\\approx 2 $ ] .",
    "2 shows this to be approximately correct .",
    "for our model to be physically relevant , we expect the yield @xmath53 to be proportional to @xmath60 although the model , at the moment , is not capable of providing the value of the proportionality constant .",
    "the average value:@xmath61= @xmath62 is a useful quantity and is predicted to be the average value of the mass number of the hypernuclei measured in experiment .",
    "this is plotted in fig.3 as a function of temperature both for @xmath3=100 and @xmath52 calculated at one - third the nuclear density ( graphs labelled 1 and 3 respectively ) .",
    "curves labelled 2 and 4 refer to the cases when @xmath5=2 and we deal with them in the next section . in the figure we also plot the value of @xmath63 if this is calculated at a lower one - sixth normal density for @xmath3=100 ( graph labelled 5 ) .",
    "several comments can be made .",
    "assuming that the plf temperature is in the expected 6 mev to 10 mev range the average mass number of hypernuclei should be in 20 to 7 range .",
    "secondly this value is insensitive to the plf mass number so long as it is reasonably large .",
    "we can also use the graph to state that if the temperature is above 6 mev the grand canonical model can give a dependable estimate but if the temperature is significantly lower , say 5 mev , grand canonical calculation can be in significant error . as expected if a lower value for the freeze - out density is used the predicted value for @xmath63 is lowered .    a more detailed plot of yields for @xmath64 for @xmath7 in the range 1 to 6 and all relevant @xmath6 s is given in fig.4 .",
    "there are two curves for each @xmath7 .",
    "let us concentrate on the lower curves .",
    "these belong to the case considered here , i.e. , @xmath5=1 .",
    "although we have drawn this this for @xmath48 for @xmath42=8 mev it is virtually unchanged for @xmath49 .",
    "the reasons were already given .",
    "these plots provide a very stringent test of the model as these yields are proportional to experimental cross - sections .",
    "we consider now @xmath48 and @xmath49 but these systems have captured two @xmath0 s rather than one .",
    "how do we expect the results to change ?",
    "fig.5 compares the yields of the composites with two @xmath0 s entrapped in @xmath65100 at 8 mev with the already studied case of one @xmath0 in @xmath3=100 at 8 mev . for @xmath5=2",
    "the number of hypernuclei ( and also the number of free @xmath0 s ) is doubled with only very small changes in the number of non - strange composites .",
    "we can understand why this happens following a similar chain of arguments as presented in the previous section .",
    "the reason for this correspondence is that at temperature 8 mev there are only insignificant number of composites beyond @xmath6=40 .",
    "the average value of @xmath61 as a function of temperature is shown in fig.3 for @xmath5=2 .",
    "curve 2 is for @xmath3=100 , @xmath5=2 and curve 1 is for @xmath3=100 , @xmath5=1 .",
    "as explained above , for @xmath66 tha average value @xmath67 will be very close but at lower temperature ( i.e.,@xmath68 ) the situation is very different .",
    "for @xmath5=1 there is a very large hypernucleus containing most of the nucleons ( fig.1 ) but for @xmath5=2 there are two hypernuclei thus they will together share the bulk of the nucleons .",
    "thus the average value of @xmath69 will drop to about half the value obtained for @xmath5=1 . in fig.3 curve 4",
    "is for @xmath5=2 in a system with @xmath3=200 , curve 3 is for @xmath5=1 in a system with @xmath3=200 .",
    "we have given a detailed description of what happens once the plf captures the produced @xmath0 particle .",
    "how @xmath0 s are produced in the violent collision zone and the probability of arrival both temporally and positionally at plf are not described here .",
    "this will depend strongly on the experiment : for example , the case of say,@xmath70au hitting @xmath2c will have to be treated differently from that of sn on sn collisions .",
    "we hope to embark upon this aspect in future .",
    "we have looked at statistical aspects only .",
    "this can be investigated more easily using the canonical thermodynamic model .",
    "the calculations here looked at productions of hypernuclei in the plf .",
    "the technique can also be applied in the participant zone . in the participant zone",
    "the temperature will be higher .",
    "also the freeze - out density is expected to be lower . as an example",
    "if we use freeze - out density 1/6-th of the normal density , @xmath48 and temperature 18 mev the average value of @xmath6 for @xmath8=1 is 2.55 .",
    "we produce more single @xmath0 s than hypernuclei .",
    "heavier hyparnuclei are not favoured at high temperature .",
    "the author is indebted to a. botvina for drawing his attention to the topic of this paper .",
    "he also thanks him for many discussions .",
