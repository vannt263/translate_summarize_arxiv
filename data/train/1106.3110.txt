    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite introduced , developed , and applied a new approach to quantitatively modeling the variability of individual quasars , describing the light curves as damped random walks ( drw ) characterized by two parameters , a timescale and an amplitude .",
    "these parameters are then found to be correlated with the physical properties of the quasar ",
    "wavelength , luminosity , and black hole mass .",
    "unfortunately , accurately measuring the parameters of individual quasars requires long ( @xmath4decade ) well - sampled light curves that are generally not available ( see @xcite ) . while this may ultimately be solved by projects such as the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( panstarrs ; @xcite ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) , their cadences are not ideal and it still requires a decade of operations to accumulate the light curves .",
    "this makes it challenging to expand on this promising new approach to probing quasar physics .",
    "there are , however , quasars with almost two decades of well - sampled light curves ",
    "the quasars lying in the regions surveyed by microlensing projects such as the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ; e.g. , @xcite ) , macho ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ; e.g. , @xcite ) . for example",
    ", the combined phases of the ogle survey ( ogle - ii to ogle - iv ) span 15 years with up to 1000 epochs in @xmath5-band and a few dozen in @xmath6-band for approximately 40 million sources with @xmath7  mag in the magellanic clouds , and the light curves continue to be extended by the ogle - iv survey .",
    "the challenge is identifying the rare quasars in these dense stellar fields .",
    "a combination of serendipity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , x - ray ( @xcite ) , and crude variability measures ( ) had succeeded in identifying only 55 and 28 quasars in the lmc and smc , respectively , as of 2010 . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the mid - ir selection techniques developed for extragalactic surveys ( @xcite ) could also be applied to dense stellar regions , albeit with some contamination from the relatively rare dusty stars ( e.g. , young stellar objects ( ysos ) , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , etc . ) . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the drw variability parameters of quasars differed from those of variable stars , providing a more quantitative approach to variability - selecting quasars that has been expanded on in @xcite and @xcite . in a single test observation under poor conditions",
    ", @xcite doubled the number of known quasars behind the smc from 28 to 57 .",
    "apart from studying variability , quasars in these fields are important tools for deriving more precise proper motions of the lmc , smc and , potentially , the galactic bulge using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ or , in the future , the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst)_. @xcite and @xcite based their lmc proper motions on 21 quasars .",
    "further improvements require better measuring the internal motions of the clouds , and this requires larger numbers of quasars well - distributed over the lmc disk . based on @xcite ,",
    "the newly confirmed lmc quasars we discuss here could be used to reduce the proper motion uncertainties by a factor of three , since our new quasars are distributed over a large @xmath8 deg@xmath1 area of the lmc disk .",
    "we will also identify any bright quasars suitable for absorption studies of the lmc s interstellar medium ( ism ) , as we expect 1 , 10 , and 74 quasars brighter than @xmath9 , 18 , and 19  mag in the four observed fields .",
    "the goal of our magellanic quasars survey ( mqs ) is to identify and characterize all these quasars , where we estimate a final sample of roughly @xmath10 quasars in a complete survey of the ogle - iii project regions .",
    "spectroscopy is essential not only for confirmation of the candidates but also to determine the luminosity , rest - wavelength and black hole masses ( through the emission line widths ) of the quasars , so that the variability parameters can be related to other physical properties .",
    "relatively large numbers of quasars will be needed to explore this ( minimally ) three dimensional parameter space quantitatively .",
    "while the sample will be smaller than the @xmath11 quasars we considered in @xcite , the longer , more densely sampled light curves should let us examine the physical correlations with less `` blurring '' from the noisy parameter estimates obtained from the sparsely sampled sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) light curves , making it far easier to determine the intrinsic parameter distributions .",
    "in this paper , we report our preliminary results for the lmc , sadly reduced in scope by hurricane yasi . in section",
    "[ sec : agnsel ] , we describe the selection methods leading to a sample of 2434 quasar candidates behind lmc . section  [ sec : data ] describes the observation plan , the observations , and the data analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : newquasars ] introduces the new quasars and section  [ sec : contamination ] discusses the contaminating sources .",
    "we discuss the results in section  [ sec : discussion ] and summarize the paper in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we selected targets based on their mid - ir , x - ray and/or photometric variability characteristics and we describe each method in detail below .",
    "the observations were designed for aaomega , a 400-fiber spectrograph mounted on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ; @xcite ) .",
    "the aaomega instrument has many more fibers than the expected number of quasars in its field of view , so we kept candidates satisfying any of the selection criteria , thereby aiming for higher completeness at the price of higher contamination .",
    "there is no point in having empty fibers even if it means observing more contaminating stars .",
    "@xcite showed that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have redder mid - ir colors than galaxies and stars , and that they form a distinctive group in the mid - ir color - color plane ( see @xcite and @xcite , and also @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the mid - ir colors of x - ray and variability selected agns ) .",
    "the red mid - ir colors of a typical agn are not due to dust emission , so mid - ir - selected agns are generally normal @xmath12 broad - line quasars ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also no significant tendency for them to be type  ii quasars .",
    "this is particularly true with the addition of a magnitude limit for the optical spectroscopy , since at most redshifts the emission from the disk is required to render the source bright enough to be observed .    in @xcite",
    ", we used this approach to identify quasars in the lmc and smc from the _ spitzer / irac _ four - band photometry ( i.e. , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath13 ) of the surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution project ( sage ; @xcite )",
    ". the 5000 agn candidates were divided into several categories .",
    "first , all the objects must be located inside the `` stern agn wedge '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "the locus of cool blackbodies passes through the wedge so the quasar sample is divided into group `` a '' if they are far from the blackbody locus , and `` b '' if they can be contaminated with cold stars .",
    "second , the mid - ir color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) was divided into regions heavily contaminated by ysos and one that should principally contain quasars , based on mid - ir properties of ysos from @xcite and the mid - ir data from the 9 deg@xmath1 of the spitzer deep wide - field survey ( sdwfs ; @xcite ) of spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the candidates were classed as `` a '' if they had the optical - to - mid - ir colors of quasars in ages and `` b '' if they did not .",
    "the most interesting candidates are classed as qso - aa ( quasar region , away from blackbody locus with qso optical - to - mid - ir colors ) , but given the large number of aaomega fibers , we targeted all classes of objects , excluding only those marked as `` outside '' ( of the ogle - iii fields ) or `` faint '' ( not detected on the ogle - iii template images ) .",
    "we searched for the ogle - iii counterparts to the 758 x - ray sources distributed over @xmath14 deg@xmath1 of the lmc from .",
    "the typical positional uncertainly for these x - ray sources is several arcseconds , so we can not effectively target them without some additional selection criterion given the stellar densities . as a second criterion we chose the most optically variable source within @xmath15 of the x - ray position . in this case",
    ", variability simply means that the light curve is inconsistent with a constant flux , without any of the more quantitative variability selection criteria we discuss in the next section .",
    "this led to a sample of 205 x - ray candidates , of which 160 were also mid - ir - selected candidates and 99 satisfy the variability cuts presented in section  [ sec : varsel ] .",
    "the ogle - iii database ( @xcite ) contains the data for 9 years ( 20012009 ) of continuously monitoring @xmath035 million objects toward the lmc .",
    "we used this database to search for variable objects that are likely quasars based on the drw model of their light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we prepared and analyzed the light curves as described in @xcite .",
    "we use the timescale @xmath16 , scaled amplitude @xmath17 , and the likelihood ratio @xmath18 between the best fitting model and a white noise model corresponding to simply expanding the photometric errors .",
    "we also fit a power - law structure function ( sf ) and estimated its slope @xmath19 between 30 days and 2 years , and an amplitude @xmath20 defined by the magnitude difference between the first and third quartile of the sorted light curve .    to remove unwanted variable sources , we use the following cuts : _ cut 1 .",
    "_ the average light curve magnitude is @xmath21  mag ; _ cut 2 .",
    "_ @xmath22 ; _ cut 3 .",
    "_ the sf slope @xmath23 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) ; _ cut 4 . _ the @xmath5-band amplitude @xmath24  mag ( this removes large amplitude variable stars ) ; @xcite report that some of @xmath09000 sdss quasars occupy areas outside the @xmath16@xmath25 cut of @xcite , therefore we decided to loosen the cut on the @xmath16 parameter and to ignore @xmath25 parameter , so _",
    "cut 5 _ is @xmath26 .",
    "when simply applied to the ogle light curve database , this process yields @xmath27 candidates .",
    "the vast majority are due to two known systematic issues .",
    "first , bright variable stars typically generate several fake , fainter variable stars in their wings , and these `` ghost '' variables show long term irregular variability .",
    "second , there can be small magnitude shifts between seasons , and ( for one field in particular ) the shifts were being misinterpreted as quasar - like variability .",
    "we carried out a quick visual inspection of all candidates , but this was over kill and would certainly be automated in any subsequent analysis .",
    "we were left with 1063 variability - selected candidates .",
    "the total number of candidates is 2434 , distributed over @xmath030 deg@xmath1 in the lmc .",
    "there are 2049 mid - ir - selected candidates and 385 non - mid - ir - selected candidates . of the 2049 mid - ir ( 385 non - mid - ir ) objects , 708 ( 355 ) are also variable and 160 ( 45 ) have associated x - ray emission .",
    "there are 1063 objects selected as variable , of which 708 are mid - ir sources , 99 are x - ray sources , and 84 both mid - ir and x - ray sources . figure  [ fig : venncand ] shows how the samples overlap .",
    "note that the limited overlap of the mid - ir and x - ray - selected agns is also seen in the spectroscopically confirmed samples of agns in the ndwfs field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the aaomega fiber allocation software allows to prioritize targets from 1 ( the lowest priority ) to 9 .",
    "we gave priorities of 9 , 8 , and 7 to sources selected by all three methods ( 84 sources ) , sources selected by only two methods ( 715 sources ) , and sources selected by only one method ( 1635 ) , respectively .",

    "the same spectrum was also convolved with the @xmath60 and @xmath5 filters in order to convert ogle magnitudes into sdss @xmath60-band magnitudes ",
    "the @xmath61 color is shown as dotted line.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : agncolor ] shows the colors of the confirmed quasars as a function of redshift . while we imposed no optical color selection criteria ,",
    "the quasars generally follow the colors of sdss quasars except at very low @xmath62 , where the host dominates the colors . adding an optical color constraint has no leverage on the selection of quasars , as the colors of quasars are indistinguishable from the colors of many lmc stars .    in figures  [ fig : tau - sigma][fig : kko9 ] , we examine the selection spaces used to select the candidates .",
    "first , we inspect the @xmath16@xmath25 variability plane from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a narrow and long trapezoidal region to select high purity sample of agn candidates . indeed ,",
    "if we had restricted our variability selection to this region , we would have a yield of 70% at the price of a significant reduction in completeness .",
    "in fact , the distribution of the variability parameters of all quasars follows the distribution found by @xcite for sdss quasars , extending outside the @xcite selection boundaries , particularly for long @xmath16 where there is also increased contamination from irregularly varying stars .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : tau - sigma ] shows the distribution of objects classified as non - quasars ( pne , ysos , etc . ) or where we failed to classify the spectrum in this variability plane .",
    "we note that the vast majority of classified non - quasars lie outside the @xcite region .            in figure",
    "[ fig : schmidt ] , we make the same comparison between the mqs quasars and the other candidates in the @xmath20@xmath19 variability plane of @xcite . we used a cut in this plane to remove more variable sources ( shown as contours ) other than quasars that we included as we greatly relaxed the drw selection criteria of @xcite in these dense stellar fields",
    ". a fair number of common variable stars are periodic with the index of the power - law sf of @xmath63 . on the other hand , objects with very high amplitude variations are unlikely to be quasars as quasar variability amplitudes on long time - scales are expected to be @xmath64 mag ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our simple cut ( solid lines ) allows higher contamination than that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dotted lines ) , but also returns the higher number of confirmed quasars .",
    "we also examined the distribution of the confirmed mqs quasars and quasar candidates relative to the mid - ir selection criteria of ( * ? ? ? * figure  [ fig : kko9 ] ) .",
    "the quasars lie in the proposed selection regions confirming the basic principles outlined in @xcite .",
    "the remaining quasar candidates ( shown in the left panels ) are either quasars with low s / n or contaminating sources . in the mid - ir color - color plot ( top panels in figure  [ fig : kko9 ] ) ,",
    "the confirmed quasars ( shown in the right panel ) and the faint candidates ( gray squares in the left panel ) occupy nearly identical regions , while the blue and red stars tend to clump in the lower - left region of the `` agn wedge '' area .",
    "also , ysos tend to have a somewhat larger color spread than the more centrally clumped agns .",
    "in the mid - ir cmd ( middle panels of figure  [ fig : kko9 ] ) , the confirmed quasars seem to be on average brighter than the remaining faint sources .",
    "the red stars tend to have bluer mid - ir @xmath65-[8.0]$ ] colors than the other sources . in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : kko9 ] ,",
    "we show the optical - to - mid - ir colors of our observed targets .",
    "as expected the vast majority of our quasars occupy the `` a '' ( qso - like optical - to - mid - ir colors ) region , but then so do the most of other sources .",
    "the red stars again have bluer optical - to - mid - ir colors than the other sources .",
    "+   +     as expected from earlier surveys of mid - ir - selected quasars ( @xcite ) , we find that 88% of the mid - ir - selected quasars show optical broad lines and are not type  ii quasars .",
    "similarly , of the 155 confirmed , mid - ir - selected quasars , 95 ( 61% ) are clearly variable sources .",
    "we observed 845 agn candidates in four @xmath03 deg@xmath1 lmc fields with aaomega to confirm 169 quasars , including 144 new ones .",
    "given the 55 previously known quasars behind the lmc , including 25 in our present fields , we have quadrupled ( to 200 ) the number of known quasars behind the lmc . by observing the eight remaining fields , we should find another @xmath0300 new quasars , although the yield would increase if all data were obtained with the full integration time .",
    "we observed the quasar candidates based on the priorities set by the number of the selection methods that picked them .",
    "if they were selected by only one method , either mid - ir colors , x - ray emission , or photometric variability , the average confirmation yield is low , at @xmath09% . if the candidate was selected based on two methods but not the third , the average confirmation rate is at 40% .",
    "the highest yields come with the simultaneous selection by all three methods , with the yield at 65% .",
    "note , however , that we deliberately chose to fill all the aaomega fibers with candidates in order to achieve higher completeness , guaranteeing high contamination rates because the surface density of quasars is well below the surface density of fibers .",
    "our biggest problem given the availability of fibers is not contamination .",
    "we could assign rough classifications to many contaminating sources , including 115 ysos ( 96 new ) , 17 pne ( 5 new ) , 39 new be and 24 blue stars , 68 red stars , and also 12 objects that are either yso / pn or blue star / yso .",
    "the big problem is that we could not classify 402 spectra due to low s / n , what is also a major problem for making black hole mass estimates from the line widths of the quasar emission lines .",
    "nonetheless , tripling the number of quasars in the lmc and smc using only 5 hr on sky is a strong vindication of the general approach and the advantages created by the large numbers of aaomega fibers . with no improvements in yields due to actually obtaining our target integration times",
    ", we estimate that completing the ogle - iii lmc and smc fields would yield @xmath0700 quasars and completing the ogle - iv fields would yield @xmath03600 quasars .",
    "these remain the best fields for extending studies of quasar variability independent of their additional uses for understanding the galaxy through the proper motions of the lmc or probing the local ism .",
