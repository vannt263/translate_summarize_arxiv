    "in recent years it has become increasingly clear that magnetic fields play an important role in the process of star formation .",
    "( see , for example , mouschovias & spitzer 1976 ; heiles et al . 1993 ; mckee et al .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental techniques for measuring the strength and direction of magnetic fields are few and these methods are observationally challenging .",
    "one such technique uses the zeeman effect in 21 cm hi absorption lines toward galactic hii regions .",
    "very large array ( vla ) observations of the zeeman effect in this line yield maps of the line - of - sight magnetic field strengths ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "these maps can then be compared to maps of the distribution and kinematics of ionized , atomic , and molecular gas to study the role of magnetic fields in star forming regions .",
    "moreover , estimates of the masses , column densities , and volume densities of interstellar material associated with the star - forming regions can be compared to field strengths measured via the zeeman effect .",
    "these comparisons are needed to determine the energetic importance of magnetic fields in star - forming regions . for studies of this type ,",
    "the m17 hii region@xmath9molecular cloud complex is ideal because it has been extensively studied at many wavelengths .",
    "the m17 hii region is one of the strongest thermal radio sources in our galaxy .",
    "its distance has been estimated through photometric and kinematic means to be @xmath14 2.2 kpc ( chini , elssser , & neckel 1980 ; reifenstein et al .",
    "1970 ; wilson et al .",
    "there are at least 100 stars in the m17 hii region with one o4 v ( kleinmann s star ) and three o5 v stars providing the bulk of the ionizing radiation ( felli , churchwell , & massi 1984 and references therein ; see fig .",
    "the hii region is made up of two distinct bar like structures which are @xmath15 pc long and @xmath16 to 1.5 pc wide .",
    "the southern bar has nearly twice the peak radio continuum flux as the northern bar , and is located just to the east of the m17  sw molecular cloud core .",
    "the near absence of optical radiation from the southern bar indicates that this region suffers much more optical extinction than the northern bar ( gull & balick 1974 , fig 1 ) .",
    "dickel ( 1968 ) and gately et al .",
    "( 1979 ) estimate @xmath17 1 - 2 mag toward the northern bar .",
    "estimates of the visual extinction toward the southern bar range from @xmath18 near the radio continuum peak to @xmath19 further west toward the core of the adjacent molecular cloud ( m17  sw ) ( beetz et al . 1976 ; felli et al .",
    "1984 ; gatley et al . 1979",
    "; thronson & lada 1983 ) .",
    "the low extinction toward the northern bar seems to indicate that the northern molecular cloud , first identified by lada et al .",
    "( 1976 ) ( @xmath20 km  s@xmath1 ) , is behind the hii region ( chrysostomou et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the most interesting characteristic of m17 is that the interface between the southern bar of the hii region and m17  sw is seen almost edge on ( fig .",
    "1 ) . from models of the density gradient on the western edge of the hii region , icke , gatley , & israel ( 1980 ) estimated that this interface lies at an angle of @xmath21 with respect to the line of sight . although the transition from the hii region to the molecular cloud is quite sharp , the interface region is too wide in photodissociation region ( pdr ) tracers such as [ cii ] 158 @xmath8 m unless it is clumpy ( see eg . , stutzki et al . 1988 ) . the extended [ cii ] 158 @xmath8 m emission observed in m17  sw by stutzki et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and boreiko , betz , & zmuidzinas ( 1990 ) requires 912 - 2000  uv photons to persist into the molecular cloud at least an order of magnitude further than the predicted uv absorption length scale .",
    "that is , atoms are being photoionized and molecules photodissociated further into the molecular cloud than one would expect for a homogeneous medium .",
    "( see tielens & hollenbach 1985 for homogeneous model calculations . )",
    "a possible explanation for this paradox is that the interface region is clumpy .",
    "evidence that m17 sw is clumpy has been observed with high angular resolution at many    = 13.0 cm    wavelengths .",
    "for example , felli et al . ( 1984 ) , found clumpiness in their @xmath22 resolution radio continuum observations of the m17 hii region .",
    "they suggest this clumpiness originates from high density neutral clumps surrounded by dense ionized envelopes .",
    "these clumps may be the remnants of clumps from the parent molecular cloud which have been overtaken by the hii region ionization front .",
    "massi , churchwell , & felli ( 1988 ) observed seven clumps in nh@xmath23 emission with 6 resolution toward the northwestern portion of the hii region@xmath9m17 sw interface .",
    "the average density and size of these clumps are @xmath24  @xmath25 and 0.05 pc .",
    "stutzki & gsten ( 1990 ) modeled their @xmath26 resolution c@xmath27o ( @xmath28 ) observation ( with a larger field of view than the nh@xmath23 observation ) with @xmath29 clumps with average densities of @xmath30 @xmath31  @xmath25 and diameters of @xmath14 0.1  pc .",
    "hobson ( 1992 ) also saw evidence for clumpiness in hco@xmath32 and hcn molecules at @xmath33 resolution , and wang et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found clumps consistent with the c@xmath27o clumps in @xmath34 to @xmath35 resolution observations of cs and c@xmath36s molecules .",
    "the identification of clumps in m17  sw is significant for several reasons .",
    "for example , calculations of density are more complex due to its dependence on the optical depth of the observed species , and the assumed clump filling factor .",
    "as discussed previously , the lengthscale of the pdr also depends on the clumpiness of the region . therefore , the regions and morphology of photodissociated atomic gas are difficult to predict .",
    "also the random motion of such clumps can influence observed linewidths and the sizescale of turbulence within the molecular cloud .",
    "these considerations play an important role in our analysis of the hi gas and the line of sight magnetic fields calculated from it .    in this paper",
    "we report the characteristics of the 21 cm continuum (  3.1 ) , hi optical depths and column densities (  3.2 ) , and the line of sight magnetic field strengths (  3.3 ) derived from our vla hi zeeman effect observation .",
    "we discuss possible origins for the most prominent hi absorption components in  4.1 .",
    "in addition , we present comparisons of our 20 km  s@xmath1 @xmath3 map with previous linear polarimetry observations in  4.2 , and we also compare expected magnetic field strengths from virial equilibrium arguments to our observed line of sight magnetic field strengths in  4.3 .",
    "our findings are summarized in  5 .",
    "our hi absorption data were obtained with the dnc configuration of the vla .",
    "key parameters from this observation can be found in table 1 .",
    "we observed both senses of circular polarization simultaneously .",
    "since the zeeman effect is very sensitive to small variations in the bandpass , we switched the sense of circular polarization passing through each telescope s if system every 10 minutes with a front - end transfer switch .",
    "in addition , we observed each of the calibration sources at frequencies shifted by @xmath37 1.2 mhz from the hi rest frequency to avoid contamination from galactic hi emission at velocities near those of m17 .",
    "the calibration , map making , cleaning , and calculation of optical depths were all carried out using the aips ( astronomical image processing system ) package of the nrao .",
    "the right ( rcp ) and left ( lcp ) circular polarization data were separately calibrated and mapped using natural weighting .",
    "these two data cubes were then combined to create stokes i ( rcp + lcp ) and stokes v ( rcp @xmath9 lcp ) cubes .",
    "the i and v cubes were cleaned using the aips task sdcln down to 70 mjy beam@xmath1 .",
    "bandpass correction was applied only to the i data since bandpass effects subtract out to first order in the v data .",
    "subsequent antenna leakage correction and magnetic field derivations were carried out using the miriad ( multichannel image reconstruction image analysis and display ) processing package from bima .",
    "figure  1 shows our 21 cm continuum contours with an optical image from gull & balick ( 1974 ) and simplified @xmath38co contours from thronson & lada ( 1983 ) superimposed . the total continuum flux at 21 cm is @xmath39 jy calculated inside the 1 jy beam@xmath1 ( 250 k ) contour level ( lowest contour in fig .",
    "1 ) . this value is almost twice that obtained by lockhart & goss ( 1978 ) with a 2 beam at the owens valley interferometer .",
    "in addition , we estimate the total flux of the southern bar is 384 jy while that of the northern bar is 240 jy ( calculated for points inside the 5 jy beam@xmath1 contour level ) .",
    "our total flux inside the 5 jy beam@xmath1 contour ( 624 jy ) is similar to the 644 jy reported by lada et al .",
    "( 1976 ) with the haystack 120 ft telescope and 620 jy observed by lbert & goss ( 1978 ) with the fleurs synthesis telescope at 21 cm .",
    "m17 hi optical depths were calculated assuming that the spin temperature @xmath10 is much less than the background continuum temperature @xmath40 of the hii region .",
    "in addition , optical depth calculations were restricted to positions where the continuum power is greater than 1 jy beam@xmath1 ( 250 k ) and the signal - to - noise ratio is higher than three .",
    "the complex nature of the absorption lines in m17 can be seen from the optical depth spectra displayed in figure 2 .",
    "the strengths of some components vary spatially over the source but remain distinct , while other components seem limited to particular regions .",
    "this complexity makes gaussian fitting very difficult .",
    "our profiles agree qualitatively with the gaussian fits reported by lockhart & goss ( 1978 ) made with a @xmath41 beam and 0.85 km  s@xmath1 velocity resolution .",
    "they fit their m17 hi optical depth profiles with eight gaussians having center velocities ranging from 4.2 to 27.5 km  s@xmath1 . in the following analysis we concentrate on the hi velocity component near 20 km  s@xmath1 and the blended components between 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 due to their high optical depths and their coincidence in velocity with other species observed in m17 sw ( see  4.1 for details ) .",
    "figure 3 displays the morphology of the hi optical depths toward the m17 hii region as a function of velocity ( every two adjacent channels were averaged ) .",
    "the steep increase of the hi optical depth toward the hii region@xmath9molecular cloud interface is clearly apparent .",
    "this effect is particularly noticeable near 20 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "although the hi optical depths become saturated at the western boundary of the hii region ( particularly in the northwest ) , they reach values at least as high as 5 . optical depth maps in the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 range have their highest values further to the east and in the northern part of the source .",
    "the column density of hi toward m17 was found using the relationship @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the optical depth per unit frequency .",
    "values for @xmath4/@xmath10 summed across the entire hi velocity range , the 20 km  s@xmath1 component ( from 17 to 24.5 km  s@xmath1 ) and the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 blended component are displayed in figs .",
    "4a , 4b , and 4c , respectively . at positions along the northwest and southwest portions of the source ,",
    "these maps represent lower limits to @xmath4/@xmath10 owing to saturation effects .",
    "note the increase in the hi column density toward the hii region@xmath9molecular cloud interface on the southwestern side of the maps .",
    "there is also spatial agreement between the hi column density concentration prominent in the total @xmath4/@xmath10 map ( fig .",
    "4a ) near @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the northern condensation seen    = 9.5 cm = 9.0 cm    = 16.0 cm    in molecular gas ( see wang et al .",
    "1993 and fig .",
    "the total @xmath46 at this position is 8.3 @xmath47 @xmath6/k .    aside from line saturation ,",
    "the main source of uncertainty in calculating hi column densities is in the value assumed for @xmath10 .",
    "upper limits to @xmath10 come from two sources .",
    "for one , the hi line widths in some cases are quite narrow . toward the southern end of the molecular ridge defined by cs emission ( wang et al .",
    "1993 ) they are as little as 2.8 km  s@xmath1 for the 20 km  s@xmath1 component ( figs . 8 , 9 ) .",
    "this width implies a maximum temperature of 180 k at this position .",
    "also , along the periphery of the continuum source , hi absorption lines exist where the continuum brightness is as little as 250 k ( 1 jy beam@xmath1 ) .",
    "evidently , @xmath10 is less than about 200 k in many directions toward m17 .",
    "at the position illustrated in fig .",
    "9 , the cs line has a width of about 2 km  s@xmath1 . if hi and cs are mixed and at a common temperature , then @xmath48100 k. in fact , modeling of iras 12 @xmath8 m infrared data byhobson & ward - thompson ( 1994 ) require a hot dust component of @xmath14108 k to explain the overall 12 @xmath8 m emission from m17 .",
    "this hot dust can be linked to the pdr by the fact that warm emission at 12 @xmath8 m is likely to arise from a population of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) ( dsert , boulanger & puget 1990 ) , and pah emission from pdr regions has been predicted by many authors ( e.g. hollenbach 1993 ) .",
    "another indication of temperature in the atomic gas comes from the observations of [ ci ] 370 @xmath8 m by genzel et al .",
    "they estimate a temperature of 50 k for [ ci ] 370 @xmath8 m gas near 20 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "molecular temperature determinations may also be relevant if some of the hi is mixed with molecular gas (  4.2 ) .",
    "bergin et al . ( 1994 ) estimate @xmath49 = 50 k from observations of low-@xmath50 co transitions , while harris et al . ( 1987 ) show that high @xmath50 co lines ( @xmath51 ) arise from pdr gas at about 250 k. meixner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found that the spatial extent and intensities of a wide array of far - infrared and submillimeter cooling lines could be adequately modeled by a three component gas consisting of very dense clumps @xmath52  @xmath25 , intermediate density interclump gas @xmath53  @xmath25 , and a tenuous extended halo @xmath54  @xmath25 .",
    "they obtained the best agreement with observations by assuming an interclump gas kinetic temperature of @xmath55 k where it is also likely that dissociated hi gas can be found .",
    "almost certainly , @xmath10 in the hi gas is quite variable , with values in the range 50 - 200 k most common .",
    "as described above , it is likely that no one spin temperature is applicable to all of the hi gas components seen in m17 . with a spin temperature of 50 k , a lower limit to the peak @xmath56 column density toward m17 is @xmath57  @xmath6 .",
    "spin temperatures between 50 k and 200 k yield peak column densities of @xmath58  @xmath6 for the 20 km  s@xmath1 component and @xmath59  @xmath6 for the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 blended components .",
    "we can use such estimates of the hi column density to estimate what fraction of the total hydrogen column density arises from atomic gas .",
    "for example , felli et al . ( 1984 ) used the optical depth of the silicon absorption feature at 10 @xmath8 m to estimate that @xmath60=30 toward the ultra compact hii region m17-uc1 ( @xmath61 ) . using @xmath62 ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 )",
    ", we estimate that the total column density of hydrogen is @xmath63  @xmath6 .",
    "our _ total _ hi column density toward m17-uc1 is @xmath64  @xmath6 ( @xmath10=50 k ) . unless saturation effects have resulted in a severe underestimate of @xmath4 , much of the gas along the line of sight to m17@xmath9uc1 is in the form of h@xmath65 .",
    "the hi zeeman effect is only sensitive to the line of sight magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) in most astrophysical situations since the zeeman splitting is a tiny fraction of the line width . since v@xmath66i@xmath67",
    ", values for @xmath3 were obtained by fitting the derivative of the i profile to the v profile at each pixel with a least squares fitting routine ( for details see roberts et al . 1993 , crutcher et al .",
    "due to the complexity of the hi spectra , the number of channels fit for each velocity component is small . to obtain more realistic error estimates , forty channels outside of the line region were included in each fit .",
    "the resulting @xmath3 maps were subsequently masked where the continuum power is less than 1 jy beam@xmath1 and when @xmath3/@xmath68(@xmath3 ) @xmath69 3 .",
    "the quantity @xmath3/@xmath68(@xmath3 ) will subsequently be denoted @xmath70 .",
    "observations of m17 have been made for many astrophysically relevant molecular and atomic transitions .",
    "from these data it is known that m17 sw has a lsr velocity of 19 to 21 km  s@xmath1 which corresponds to the velocity of one of our strongest hi absorption components .",
    "figure 5 shows an hi optical depth profile and several molecular emission profiles from stutzki et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for a position at the hii region@xmath9molecular cloud interface .",
    "note the similarity in the center velocities ( @xmath14 20 km  s@xmath1 ) of each species .",
    "this velocity coincidence strongly suggests that the 20 km  s@xmath1 hi absorption component is closely associated with the molecular cloud , most likely arising in the pdr at the hii region - molecular cloud interface .",
    "further evidence for this association comes from the steep rise in the 20 km  s@xmath1 hi optical depth toward the interface region ( fig .",
    "therefore , values of @xmath3 derived from the hi zeeman effect in this component are of direct relevance to the energetics of the molecular cloud and its immediate surroundings ( see4.1.2 ) .",
    "a significant magnetic field exists in the 20 km  s@xmath1 component over much of the central region of the southern bar .",
    "the velocity range of the fit for this component is 17.0 to 24.6 km  s@xmath1 . a distinct hi component at @xmath14 23 km  s@xmath1 is also visible toward the northwestern corner of the source .",
    "a component at this velocity was also detected at this velocity by lada & chaisson ( 1975 ) in h@xmath65co .",
    "however , detailed inspection of the hi data cube shows that the channel range used to fit the 20 km  s@xmath1 component was such that no magnetic field was detected in regions where the 23 km  s@xmath1 component is distinct . therefore , the @xmath3 detected in the velocity range 17 to 24.6 km  s@xmath1 is only representative of the field in the 20 km  s@xmath1 hi component .",

    "negative values indicate that @xmath3 is toward the observer .",
    "values of @xmath3 for this component ( with sufficiently high @xmath70 to pass our cutoff of 3 ) are centered near the continuum peak of the southern bar .",
    "the values for @xmath3 start out at @xmath71100 @xmath8 g on the eastern side of the southern bar , pass through a shallow saddle point and then rapidly rise to @xmath71450 @xmath8 g on the western side of the map near the hii region@xmath9molecular cloud interface .",
    "the maximum @xmath70 obtained for this component is 8.5 .",
    "the apparently rapid change in direction of the @xmath3 along the narrow band in the northwest portion of the map may be real but is approaching the limit of our sensitivity and will require future observation to confirm .",
    "note that the region of highest measured @xmath3 coincides closely with the ridge of cs emission observed by wang et al .",
    "( 1993 ; fig . 8) . also , the 20 km  s@xmath1 hi line in this region is very narrow , and its width and center velocity correspond closely to those of the cs lines ( fig .",

    "the symmetry axis of the bowl lies in the plane of the sky , and the overlapping [ oi ] 63 @xmath8 m emission arises from a pdr on the front and/or back sides of the bowl .",
    "the bottom of the bowl ( at the southwestern edge of the southern bar ) is the portion of the hii region - molecular cloud interface viewed edge@xmath9on .",
    "further evidence of a bowl@xmath9like morphology is the high visual extinction toward the southern bar which presumably arises from the front side of the bowl .",

    "the interface layer is perpendicular to the plane of the sky , with the ionizing stars offset to the northeast .",
    "the densest accumulation of ionized gas in m17 lies along the `` working surface '' near the ionization front .",
    "therefore , the brightest region in the m17 continuum map , the southern bar , does not coincide in the sky with the ionizing stars as it does for the orion nebula .",
    "the clumpiness of the m17 interface has been observed in many molecular species (  1 ) .",
    "it seems to closely resemble the scenario discussed by bertoldi & draine ( 1996 ) , whereby dense clumps are slowly photodissociated by a nearby hii region . in this case",

    "the velocity range of the 20 km  s@xmath1 hi component ( 17 to 24.6 km  s@xmath1 ) includes most of the molecular gas in the m17 region ( e.g rainey et al .",
    "1987 and  3.3.1 ) . therefore , hi components in this range are likely to be closely associated with the bulk of the m17 molecular gas .",
    "such an association is particularly clear toward the molecular ridge ( see fig",

    "component closely matches that of a variety of molecular lines , including high density tracers such as cs ( figs . 5 , 9 , and 12 ) .",
    "this hi component is also relatively narrow ( 3 - 5 km  s@xmath1 ) , and its center velocity changes little with position along the interface region .",

    "much of this quiescent gas must lie in the edge - on hii region@xmath9m17 sw interface region at the bottom of the bowl described by meixner et al .",
    "hence the concentration of 20 km  s@xmath1 hi gas and high @xmath3 ( @xmath83 @xmath8 g ) near the interface region ( figs . 3 , 4b , 6 , and 8) .",

    "is directly representative of magnetic fields in the molecular gas .",
    "a second possibility is that the absorbing hi near 20 km  s@xmath1 is confined to a thin photodissociated shell about the molecular ridge or to thin shells surrounding a multitude of molecular clumps within the ridge . in this case , the hi zeeman effect is also representative of the magnetic field in the molecular gas if the hi is photodissociated but dynamically undisturbed h@xmath65 .    in either case",
    ", the hi zeeman effect near the    = 6.8 cm    = 8.0 cm    molecular ridge must arise in relatively dense gas if approximate equilibrium exists between the magnetic energy density and that associated with non - thermal motions in the gas .",
    "such an equilibrium was suggested by myers & goodman ( 1988a , 1988b ) on the basis of limited observational data .",

    "however , at the position cited here , @xmath46 in the 20 km  s@xmath1 component is only 3 @xmath47 @xmath6k , so @xmath96 @xmath6 for @xmath9750 k. a typical scale length for hi absorption features in the plane of the sky is of order 2 pc ( 3@xmath98 at 2.2 kpc ) .",
    "if the same scale length applies along the line of sight , then @xmath99 @xmath100 250 @xmath25 .",
    "that is , if the hi zeeman effect arises in gas at a density of order @xmath87 , then the hi could be about only a 1% constituent of largely molecular gas .",

    "( 1988 ) and goldsmith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) near this direction ( @xmath102 @xmath6 ) is about 100 times higher than @xmath4 .",
    "alternatively , hi might not be mixed with h@xmath65 but confined to thin sheets or very dense , thin atomic envelopes surrounding the multitude of molecular clumps which have been observed in the interface region ( see  1 ) .",
    "note that this would still require the hi gas to occupy about 1% of the line of sight in the absorbing region .",
    "these two cases are the same ones cited above to explain the close association of hi gas with molecular gas in the ridge .",
    "the morphology and velocity structure of gas between 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 suggest that it also lies very close to the hii region on the near side of the bowl and that it has been shocked and accelerated away from the ionized gas .",
    "the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 gas is primarily distributed in an arc that partially encircles the northern and southern bars of the hii region ( figs . 3 , 4c ) .",
    "this arc of hi column density corresponds well with a similar arc structure apparent in @xmath38co(@xmath1032 ) emission mapped by rainey et al .",
    "( 1987 ) in the velocity range 14@xmath920 km  s@xmath1 .",

    "also , hi in this velocity range shows complex velocity structure with numerous components appearing at various positions across the source ( figure 2 , 11 a , b , c ) .",
    "this complicated velocity field and magnetic field reversal ( see  3.3.2 ) suggest that gas in the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 range lies in an interface zone that has been dynamically affected by interactions with the hii region , unlike the 20 km  s@xmath1 component discussed in  4.1.2 .",
    "overall , the association between atomic and molecular gas in this velocity range is much less clear than it is at 20 km  s@xmath1 near the western interface region .",
    "this could in part be due to fact that few high resolution molecular observations have mapped the northern regions of m17 .",
    "however , judging from @xmath38co @xmath1040 , @xmath38co@xmath1052 , and @xmath73co observations ( lada 1976 ; rainey et al . 1987 ) which all show components in this velocity range , the density of molecular material in this region is low compared to the western interface . toward the northern bar in particular , where the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 hi magnetic fields are high ( see  3.3.2 )",
    ", there is not always a molecular counterpart in the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 velocity range .",
    "in fact , for the positions shown in figs .",
    "11a and 11b there is no evidence of molecular gas .",
    "such a variable ratio of atomic to molecular gas might be expected if gas in this velocity range has been subjected to a widely variable degree of dissociation in the interface region .",
    "although molecular column densities are low in the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 range , hi field strengths are very high , reaching values of over + 500 @xmath8 g ( fig .",
    "therefore , the assumption of equilibrium between magnetic and non - thermal energies leads to conclusions similar to those for gas near 20 km  s@xmath1 (  4.1.2 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath106 @xmath25 , and @xmath99 along the line of sight is about two orders of magnitude less than @xmath87 . yet",
    "the scarcity of molecular gas at positions of high field strength means that hi at these positions can not exist as a minor constituent in a largely molecular region .",
    "if the hi alone is to exist at a density near @xmath107 @xmath25 , it must reside in one or more thin layers that occupy only about 1% of the path length through the hi absorbing region .",
    "that is , the absorbing hi gas is distributed in a very clumpy fashion along the line of sight .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with numerous other indications of a highly clumped medium in the m17 region (  1 ) .",
    "most likely , the absorbing hi gas is shocked , photodissociated gas lying in thin interface regions about ablating neutral clumps .",
    "the clumps , in turn , lie within mostly ionized gas , like the clumps modeled by bertoldi & draine ( 1996 ) or the clumps identified by felli et al .",
    "( 1984 ) in high resolution m17 radio continuum maps . in these clumps , the pressure of the ionized gas drives a shock front into the neutral medium .",
    "therefore , a rough equivalence between the thermal energy density of the ionized gas and the magnetic energy density in the adjacent compressed atomic region is expected . evidently , this is the case . if the m17 ionized gas has a temperature of 8000 k ( subrahmanyan & goss 1996 ) and a density of @xmath107 @xmath25 ( felli et al . 1984 ) , then its thermal energy density is equivalent to the magnetic energy density in the thin hi layers for b @xmath100 500 @xmath8 g .",
    "several reasons exist to expect hii region driven motions of a few km  s@xmath1 near m17 .",
    "observationally , rainey et al .",
    "( 1987 ) fit their @xmath73co data on molecular clumps near the southern bar to a geometric expansion model about kleinemann s star ( fig .",
    "1 ) . they obtain an expansion velocity of @xmath100 11 km  s@xmath1 about this star .",
    "radio and optical recombination line observations often reveal split profiles shifted by about @xmath108 km  s@xmath1 from the hii region rest velocity ( gull & balick 1974 ; joncas & roy 1986 ) . theoretically , bertoldi & drain ( 1996 ) estimated the shock - induced acceleration expected in the orion nebula pdr , obtaining a value of 3 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this value is somewhat sensitive to the ratio of post to pre - shock density , taken by bertoldi & draine ( 1996 ) as 2 . if the ratio for m17 is 4 , as suggested by the ratio of the square of the @xmath38co @xmath109 ( 5 km  s@xmath1 ) line width ( harris et al .",
    "1987 ) to the square of the cs @xmath110 line width ( 2.5 km  s@xmath1 , wang et al .",
    "1993 ) , then the shock induced acceleration is increased to 6 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "also , bertoldi ) and bertoldi & mckee ( 1990 ) discuss a rocket effect upon ablating clumps of neutral gas exposed to ionizing radiation .",
    "they estimate that rocket acceleration should amount to a clump velocity of 5@xmath910 km  s@xmath1 under typical circumstances .",
    "these estimates of shock speed , agree quite well with the 2@xmath98 km  s@xmath1 blueshift of the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 componets .",
    "a number of studies have been made of linear polarization toward m17 .",
    "these include polarization at optical and near ir wavelengths from grain absorption and polarization in the far ir from grain emission .",
    "( see references cited by dotson 1996 . )",
    "such studies reveal the position angles of the magnetic field in the plane of the sky ( @xmath111 ) , but they yield little if any information about field strengths .",
    "therefore , they compliment zeeman effect studies , assuming the linear and circular polarization arise in the same regions . in general , field directions inferred from grain absorption do not agree with those inferred from grain emission",
    ". very likely , this disprepancy results from the different regions sampled by each technique , with grain emission data more likely representative of the field directions inside m17 sw ( goodman et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the study of polarized 100 @xmath8 m dust emission by dotson ( 1996 ) provides the most comprehensive available data set for comparison with hi zeeman effect results . in figure 14",
    "we present a map of the position angle of the transverse magnetic field @xmath111 from dotson ( 1996 ) overlaid on our @xmath1420 km  s@xmath1 @xmath3 grayscale .",
    "the resolution of the dotson study ( 35@xmath112 ) is comparable to that of the hi data .",
    "also , the 20 km  s@xmath1 hi component likely samples at least part of the molecular ridge (  4.1.2 ) as does the 100 micron emission .",
    "a principal conclusion of the dotson study is that the m17 magnetic field shows a significant degree of spatial coherence across m17 .",
    "the hi zeeman data for the 20 km  s@xmath1 component corroborates this result ( figs . 6 , 8) .",
    "moreover , the eight - fold _ increase _ in @xmath3 from east to west toward the molecular ridge ( fig .",
    "8) is matched by a _",
    "decrease _ in fractional linear polarization from about 4% to 1% . along this same line",
    "the field has a nearly constant position angle ( predominantly east - west ) .",
    "since @xmath3 is perpendicular to both to the transverse magnetic field and the 100 @xmath8 m linear polarization vectors , one might expect to see a correlation between regions of maximum @xmath3 and minimum 100 @xmath8 m polarization .",
    "one obvious interpretation of the ir and hi zeeman data is that the magnetic field lines curve into the line of sight as one approaches the molecular ridge from the east .",
    "in such a case , @xmath3 may be a close approximation to the total field strength in the region of the molecular ridge sampled by hi . since the hi must lie in front of the hii region , the field lines in this picture wrap around the hii region on the front side of the bowl , becoming more aligned with the line of sight at the bottom of the bowl as they pass through the molecular ridge .",
    "this geometry is consistent with the inferences made by dotson from the linear polarization data alone .",
    "the origin of the field curvature may lie in the process of gravitational contraction that formed the molecular ridge , gathering an initially uniform field along the line of sight into an hourglass shape with the ridge at its waist .",
    "an hourglass shaped field structure was also suggested for the w3 region by roberts et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , although for this source , the axis of the hourglass is nearly in the plane of the sky rather than along the line of sight .",
    "alternately , the present geometry of the m17 field may represent the bending effects of the hii region as it expands into the molecular cloud deforming a field originally along the line of sight into a bowl - like shape .",
    "it should be noted that the occurrence of decreasing linear polarization toward the the 100 @xmath8 m flux and column density maxima could result from effects other than a true minimum in the transverse magnetic field component .",
    "for example , optical depth effects , dust properties , grain alignment efficiency , or some combination of these can cause a decrease in the linear polarization independent of the magnetic field . on the other hand , the magnetic field itself could simply be more tangled in higher density regions ( jones , klebe , & dickey 1992 ; myers & goodman 1991 ) .",
    "in addition , the 760 @xmath8 m polarimetry by valle & bastien ( 1996 ) does not show a minimum in the linear polarization in this region of the molecular ridge .",
    "however , the 760 @xmath8 m polarization arises from cooler dust grains which could be spatially distinct along the line of sight from those emitting at 100 @xmath8 m .",
    "future polarimetry of this region at an intermediate wavelength from iso and    = 16.0 cm    higher resolution hi zeeman results may help to clarify this issue .      the magnetic field in a cloud can be separately described in terms of a static component @xmath113 and a time - dependent or wave component @xmath114 .",
    "the static component connects the cloud to the external medium and also determines the total magnetic flux through the cloud , while the wave component is associated with mhd alfvn waves in the cloud ( e.g. arons & max 1975 ) .",
    "although the static component of the field can only provide support to the cloud perpendicular to the field lines , the turbulent or wave component can provide 3-d support ( mckee & zweibel 1995 , also see references therein ) .",
    "if a cloud is threaded by @xmath115@xmath113 , it can be completely supported perpendicular to @xmath113 if its mass does not exceed the magnetic critical mass @xmath116 ( mouschovias & spitzer 1976 ) .",
    "this criterion leads directly to the observationally relevant relation @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the average proton column density of the cloud .",
    "if @xmath113 @xmath119 @xmath120 ( i.e. @xmath121 ) , then the cloud is supported by @xmath113 , it is magnetically subcritical , and further evolution of the cloud perpendicular to the field can only occur via ambipolar diffusion .",
    "if @xmath113 @xmath69 @xmath120 , ( i.e. @xmath122 ) , then @xmath113 can not fully support the cloud , the cloud is magnetically supercritical , and internal motions must supply additional support if the cloud is stable . in this case ,",
    "further evolution of such a cloud will be controlled in part by processes that create and dissipate internal motions .    as discussed above",
    ", the second type of support provided by magnetic fields arises from alfvn waves generated in a turbulent velocity field .",
    "the fluctuating or wave component of the magnetic field @xmath114 organizes supersonic ( but sub - alfvnic ) motions in the gas so that highly dissipative shocks do not occur .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that equipartition between the wave s kinetic and magnetic potential energy densities almost certainly exists in molecular clouds ( zweibel & mckee 1995 , and references therein ) . that is @xmath123 @xmath114@xmath124 where @xmath125 is the non - thermal component of the velocity dispersion , which is assumed to arise exclusively from alfvn waves .",
    "these assumptions lead to the equivalent of equation ( 2 ) for @xmath114 , that is , @xmath126 where @xmath89 is the non - thermal line width ( fwhm ) and @xmath127 is the proton density . since zeeman effect measurements are generally sensitive to large scale fields ( on the order of the beam size ) , they are expected to be better indicators of @xmath113 than of @xmath114 . therefore , the formal usefulness of comparing equation ( 4 ) for @xmath114 to zeeman observations ( @xmath3 ) is not clear .",
    "however , limited observational comparisons of zeeman measurements with the @xmath114 predicted from equation ( 4 ) show that there may also be approximate equipartition between the wave s kinetic and static magnetic energy densities in molecular clouds ; ie .",

    "although @xmath89 is often estimated from the @xmath138 of optically thin lines , we believe a more accurate estimate for the internal motions of the m17 sw core as a whole comes from the velocity dispersion of the center velocities of the clumps themselves .",
    "stutzki & gsten ( 1990 ) identified 180 , @xmath139 pc c@xmath27o clumps in m17 sw and provide center velocities for each .",
    "the dispersion of these center velocities is 2.7 km  s@xmath1 , equivalent to @xmath89 = 6.3 km  s@xmath1 . from these parameters and equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , @xmath120@xmath140 @xmath8 g and @xmath114@xmath100 620 @xmath8 g .",

    "therefore , the evolution of the m17 sw core is not entirely controlled by @xmath113 and ambipolar diffusion , and internal motions must play a role in its support and dynamics . note that these estimates are not necessarily valid for individual clumps within the core ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) .    another perspective on cloud support",

    "( 1993 ) explain why virtually all self - gravitating clouds must be close to dynamically critical since their internal pressures would otherwise be comparable to external pressures , contrary to observation . if m17  sw is dynamically critical , that is , on the verge of collapse , then the virial equation above can be rewritten in the form @xmath145^{1/2}.\\ ] ] given the m17 sw cloud parameters estimated at the beginning of this section , @xmath144/@xmath146@xmath142@xmath146 @xmath100 0.3 , so @xmath113 @xmath147@xmath120 @xmath148 @xmath8 g , and @xmath149 . given the inevitable errors in estimating virial terms , these values are quite uncertain .",
    "however , they can be regarded as a possible equilibrium model for the energetics of the m17 sw core . in this",
    "model , internal motions in the core are sub - virial since @xmath144/@xmath142 @xmath69 1/2 , and the cloud is magnetically supercritical .",
    "that is , the cloud is supported in part by internal motions , with the remainder of the support coming from @xmath113 . moreover , the magnitude of @xmath113 in this model is comparable to @xmath114 ( 620 @xmath8 g ) , so that the magnetic support provided by the static and wave components of the field are comparable .",
    "this suggests that @xmath113@xmath100@xmath114 is a good assumption for m17 sw ( see above ) .",
    "although our estimate for @xmath113 using this model is quite close to the highest measured values of @xmath3 ( @xmath150 @xmath8 g ) , this agreement must be considered somewhat fortuitous since estimates of @xmath113 are very sensitive to uncertainties in cloud parameters and , of course , @xmath3 is just one component of the field .",
    "apart from equations ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) , one other method has been used to estimate field strengths in self - gravitating clouds .",
    "letting 2@xmath144@xmath151@xmath142@xmath146 we obtain the following mass estimate : @xmath152,\\ ] ] where @xmath81 parametrizes the extent to which a magnetic field is needed to support the cloud , ie .",

    "we obtain @xmath154~ \\mu{\\rm g},\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is in pc and @xmath89 is in km  s@xmath1 .",
    "note that this formulation is similar to those found in myers & goodman ( 1988a , 1988b ) , mouschovias & psaltis ( 1995 ) ( do not include @xmath81 ) , and bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) ( using @xmath81 ) . comparing the mass computed from equation ( 7 ) , @xmath156 , to the c@xmath27o mass of m17 sw ( @xmath157 ) , we find @xmath158 and @xmath114@xmath159 @xmath8 g , again , remarkably similar to the peak measured value of @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that the field strength predicted by equation ( 8) is relatively well matched by @xmath3 may be another indication that @xmath114@xmath100@xmath113 for most clouds ( see above ) .    although formulations similar to equation ( 8) have often been used to estimate magnetic fields in the literature ( see above ) , we consider equation ( 6 ) to yield a somewhat better field estimate , at least in so far as comparison with zeeman observations are concerned .",
    "this is because 1 . )",
    "if we assume @xmath160 ( myers & goodman 1988a , 1988b ) , equation ( 8) is essentially the same as equation ( 4 ) , both of which estimate @xmath114 .",
    "there is evidence ( this work , and references cited above ) that @xmath114@xmath100@xmath113 , but this assertion will require more observational evidence to confirm . 2 .",
    ") in addition , the assumption that @xmath81=1 , excludes entirely the need for support from @xmath113 , contrary to our observational zeeman evidence , ie .",
    "@xmath8 g .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath81 in the equation solves this delima , but creates a new one , since the estimate of @xmath81 only describes the degree of under - virialization in the cloud , and does not distinguish between support from @xmath113 and @xmath114 , while equation ( 8) is formally an estimate of @xmath114 alone . for these reasons equation ( 6 ) may be the best method of estimating the magnetic field based on cloud parameters for the purpose of comparison with zeeman measurements even though all the estimates found here ( ie .",

    "the hi absorption lines toward m17 show complicated profiles with 5 to 8 distinct velocity components . in general , the highest hi column densities are concentrated toward the hii region@xmath9m17 sw boundary .",
    "this effect is particularly noticeable in the velocity range of the 20 km  s@xmath1 hi component .",
    "a lower limit to the maximum hi column density summed across the whole hi velocity range is n@xmath161= 1.0@xmath162  @xmath6 .",
    "atomic and molecular emission temperature measurements suggest that @xmath10 lies between 50 and 200 k.    a magnetic field has been detected at the same velocity as m17  sw ( @xmath163  km  s@xmath1 ) which peaks steeply toward the m17 hii region@xmath9m17 sw interface to values of @xmath3= @xmath9450 @xmath8 g .",
    "analysis of this hi component s line width , along with its velocity and spatial coincidence with molecular density tracers along the m17 sw molecular ridge suggest that it originates in unshocked pdr gas .",
    "comparison of the proton density implied by the observed @xmath3 and the 20 km  s@xmath1 hi density show that the hi gas is only a @xmath14 1% constituent of the gas along the line of sight toward m17 . at the same time",
    "its distribution along the stutzki et al .",
    "( 1988 ) strip scan across the hii region@xmath9m17 sw boundary agrees well with that of molecular gas .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the 20 kms hi gas lies in thin , dense shells around the numerous molecular clumps which have been observed in m17 sw , or it must be well mixed with fairly dense ( @xmath164 @xmath25 ) interclump molecular gas .",
    "in addition , the region of maximum @xmath3 for this component agrees spatially with a minimum in 100 @xmath8 m polarimetry which samples the transverse magnetic field .",
    "another significant @xmath3 was observed in the blended component at 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 with values reaching @xmath165 550 @xmath8 g .",
    "the morphology of high @xmath4 for this component is quite different from that at 20 km  s@xmath1 , with the greatest concentrations found further east and toward the northern parts of the source . from these components morphology , line width , and evidence that there is a significant amount of obscuring material on the front side of the m17 hii region , we suggest that the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 components originate in shocked gas that is streaming toward us along the line of sight .",
    "estimates of the shock speeds which can be produced by the m17 hii region agree well with these components blueshift ( 2@xmath98 km  s@xmath1 ) with respect to the rest velocity of the region . like",
    "the 20 km  s@xmath1 hi component , the 11@xmath917 km  s@xmath1 hi gas can only comprise @xmath14 1% of the line of sight gas , and may be confined to photodissociated hi shells surrounding molecular clumps close to the hii regions front side .",
    "using various virial arguments we have estimated that m17 sw is sub - virial ( @xmath144/@xmath142@xmath69 1/2 ) and magnetically supercritical ( @xmath166 ) . in our model @xmath13 of m17 sw s total support",
    "is provided by its static magnetic field @xmath113 ( @xmath148 @xmath8 g ) , with the rest of the support arising from internal motions including support from the wave component of the field @xmath114 .",
    "estimates of the static ( @xmath113 ) and wave ( @xmath114 ) components of the magnetic field indicate that they are of approximately the same magnitude ( @xmath167 @xmath8 g ) and agree well with our highest values of @xmath3 ( @xmath168@xmath8 g ) .",
    "subsequent analysis of higher resolution vla hi zeeman effect data will give better sensitivity to @xmath3 if the field is tangled , and allow us to better differentiate separate velocity components .",
    "in addition , observations of the zeeman effect in oh may also help untangle the magnetic field data at this interface since it tends to trace somewhat higher density gas .    c. brogan thanks nasa / epscor for fellowship support through the kentucky space grant consortium .",
