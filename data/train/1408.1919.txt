    "weak value amplification ( wva ) @xcite is a concept that has been used under a great variety of experimental conditions @xcite to reveal tiny changes of a variable of interest . in all those cases ,",
    "a priori sensitivity limits were not due to the quantum nature of the light used ( _ photon statistics _ ) , but instead to the insufficient resolution of the detection system , what might be termed generally as _",
    "technical noise_. wva was a feasible choice to go beyond this limitation . in spite of this extensive evidence , ",
    "its interpretation has historically been a subject of confusion \" @xcite .",
    "for instance , while some authors @xcite show that  weak - value - amplification techniques ( which only use a small fraction of the photons ) compare favorably with standard techniques ( which use all of them ) \" , others @xcite claim that wva  does not offer any fundamental metrological advantage \" , or that wva @xcite `` does not perform better than standard statistical techniques for the tasks of single parameter estimation and signal detection '' . however , these conclusions are criticized by others based on the idea that `` the assumptions in their statistical analysis are irrelevant for realistic experimental situations '' @xcite .",
    "the problem might reside in    here we make use of some simple , but fundamental , results from quantum estimation theory @xcite to show that there are two sides to consider when analyzing in which sense wva can be useful . on the one hand",
    ", the technique generally makes use of linear - optics unitary operations .",
    "therefore , it can not modify the statistics of photons involved .",
    "basic quantum estimation theory states that the post - selection of an appropriate output state , the basic element in wva , can not be better than the use of the input state @xcite",
    ". moreover , wva uses some selected , appropriate but partial , information about the quantum state that can not be better that considering the full state . indeed , due to the unitarian nature of the operations involved , it should be equally good any transformation of the input state than performing no transformation at all .",
    "in other words , when considering only the quantum nature of the light used , wva can not enhance the precision of measurements @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a more general analysis that goes beyond only considering the quantum nature of the light , shows that wva can be useful when certain technical limitations are considered . in this sense , it might increase the ultimate resolution of the detection system by effectively lowering the value of the smallest quantity that can detected . in most scenarios ,",
    "although not always @xcite , the signal detected is severely depleted , due to the quasi - orthogonality of the input and output states selected . however , in many applications , limitations are not related to the low intensity of the signal @xcite , but to the smallest change that the detector can measure irrespectively of the intensity level of the signal .",
    "a potential advantage of our approach is that we make use of the concept of trace distance , a clear and direct measure of the degree of distinguishability of two quantum states .",
    "indeed , the trace distance gives us the minimum probability of error of distinguishing two quantum states that can be achieved under the best detection system one can imagine @xcite .",
    "measuring tiny quantities is essentially equivalent to distinguishing between nearly parallel quantum states .",
    "therefore we offer a very basic and physical understanding of how wva works , based on the idea of how wva transforms very close quantum states , which can be useful to the general physics reader .    here",
    "were we use an approach slightly different from what other analysis of wva do , where most of the times the tool used to estimate its usefulness is the fisher information .",
    "contrary to how we use the trace distance here , to set a sensitivity bound only considering how the quantum state changes for different values of the variable of interest , the fisher information requires to know the probability distribution of possible experimental outcomes for a given value of the variable of interest .",
    "therefore , it can look for sensitivity bounds for measurements by including _ technical characteristics _ of specific detection schemes @xcite .",
    "a brief comparison between both approaches will be done towards the end of this paper .",
    "one word of caution will be useful here .",
    "the concept of weak value amplification is presented for the most part in the framework of quantum mechanics theory , where it was born .",
    "it can be readily understood in terms of constructive and destructive interference between probability amplitudes @xcite .",
    "interference is a fundamental concept in any theory based on waves , such as classical electromagnetism .",
    "therefore , the concept of weak value amplification can also be described in many scenarios in terms of interference of classical waves @xcite .",
    "indeed , most of the experimental implementations of the concept , since its first demonstration in 1991 @xcite , belong to this type and can be understood without resorting to a quantum theory formalism .      for the sake of example , we consider a specific weak amplification scheme @xcite , depicted in fig .",
    "1 , which has been recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite . it aims at measuring very small temporal delays @xmath0 , or correspondingly tiny phase changes @xcite , with the help of optical pulses of much larger duration .",
    "we consider this specific case because it contains the main ingredients of a typical wva scheme , explained below , and it allows to derive analytical expressions of all quantities involved , which facilitates the analysis of main results .",
    "moreover , the scheme makes use of linear optics elements only and also works with large - bandwidth partially - coherent light @xcite .",
    "in general , a wva scheme requires three main ingredients : a ) the consideration of two subsystems ( here two degrees of freedom : the polarisation and the spectrum of an optical pulse ) that are weakly coupled ( here we make use of a polarisation - dependent temporal delay that is introduced with the help of a michelson interferometer ) ; b ) the _ pre - selection _ of the input state of both subsystems ; and c ) the _ post - selection _ of the state in one of the subsystems ( the state of polarisation ) and the measurement of the state of the remaining subsystem ( the spectrum of the pulse ) . with appropriate _ pre- _ and _ post - selection _ of the polarisation of the output light , tiny changes of the temporal delay @xmath0 can cause anomalously large changes of its spectrum , rendering in principle detectable very small temporal delays .    )",
    "splits the input into two orthogonal linear polarisations that propagate along different arms of the interferometer .",
    "an additional qwp is introduced in each arm to rotate the beam polarisation by @xmath1 to allow the recombination of both beams , delayed by a temporal delay @xmath0 , in a single beam by the same pbs .",
    "after pbs@xmath2 , the output polarisation state is selected with a liquid crystal variable retarder ( lcvr ) followed by a second polarising beam splitter ( pbs@xmath3 ) .",
    "the variable retarder is used to set the parameter @xmath4 experimentally .",
    "finally , the spectrum of each output beam is measured using an optical spectrum analyzer ( osa ) .",
    "( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) and ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) correspond to two sets of orthogonal polarisations .",
    "figure drawn by one of the authors ( luis - jose salazar serrano).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    let us be more specific about how all these ingredients are realized in the scheme depicted in fig .",

    "light beams with orthogonal polarisations traversing each arm of the interferometer are delayed @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , which constitute the weak coupling between the two degrees of freedom .",
    "after recombination of the two orthogonal signals in the same pbs@xmath2 , the combination of a liquid - crystal variable retarder ( lcvr ) and a second polarising beam splitter ( pbs@xmath3 ) performs the post - selection of the polarisation of the output state , projecting the incoming signal into the polarisation states @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",

    "<S> while wva can not be used to go beyond some fundamental sensitivity limits that arise from considering the full nature of the quantum states , wva can notwithstanding enhance the sensitivity of _ real _ detection schemes that are limited by many other things apart from the quantum nature of the states involved , i.e. _ technical noise_. importantly , it can do that in a straightforward and easily accessible manner . </S>"
