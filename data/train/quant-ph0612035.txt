    "the mean king problem was first introduced by vaidman et al.@xcite , and has since received a lot of attention as a basic quantum mechanical retrodiction problem : in the story , physicist alice faces the mean king , who asks her to prepare a quantum system , on which his men will perform a von neumann measurement in one of a specified set of orthonormal bases .",
    "alice is not present during this measurement , and knows neither the basis chosen nor the result obtained .",
    "she is then allowed a final check on the system ( typically including entangled records of the initial preparation ) , leaving her with some classical measurement values only .",
    "she is then told which basis was used and is asked to correctly name the values found by the king s men .    in @xcite",
    "the system was a qubit , and the three bases involved were the eigenbases of the three pauli matrices .",
    "these are a special case of _ mutually unbiased bases _ ( `` mubs '' ) , which means that after preparing a basis state of any of these bases , the probability distributions in all other bases will be uniform .",
    "it was subsequently shown that a maximal set of @xmath1 mutually unbiased bases exist for a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space , whenever @xmath0 is a power of a prime , but to decide the existence of such a set for other dimensions ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) has proved to be very hard . a status report on this problem , which has also many repercussions on other problems in quantum information is to be found in @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the basic statement of the problem makes no reference to the mub property of the bases chosen by the king .",
    "so , supposing the game is to be played in @xmath3 , why should the king make things difficult ( if not impossible ) for himself by trying to find first a set of mutually unbiased bases in that dimension ?",
    "why not just pick any bases at random , say ? moreover , as we will see below , in the mutually unbiased case , alice has a very simple way to compute a safe strategy .",
    "again , a really mean king might make things more difficult for alice here .",
    "these remarks go against another intuition , which would seem to make the choice of unbiased bases the meanest option for the king : indeed , if alice were trying to just make a measurement in one of the king s bases , hoping to pick the right one , in all but the lucky case her results will be totally useless . if the game were to be played many times , and alice s aim was to be right as often as possible , she could improve her guesses using the correlations between bases .",
    "this gain is nullified in the mub case .",
    "but the problem is not set like that : we demand of a solution that alice is right _ in every single run _ , and",
    "this is not made easier in the least by the existence of some statistical correlations between the bases .",
    "in other words , the intuition that unbiased bases are an especially mean choice by the king is fallacious .",
    "we therefore drop the assumption of unbiasedness and ask , for _ any _ choice of finitely many bases by the king : can alice find a strategy , consisting of an initial entangled preparation and a suitable measurement on the joint system after the kings men are through with their part , such that she gets the right value with probability one ?",
    "not very much has been done about this problem without assuming mutual unbiasednes .",
    "some special cases have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the available studies apparently remain incomplete even in the qubit case ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "to state our main results , let us fix some notation for the rest of the paper .",
    "the system hilbert space on which the king s men make their measurement will be denoted by @xmath4 , and has dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the number of bases chosen will be @xmath5 , and the bases themselves will be denoted by @xmath6 , for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "an important property of a choice of bases is the space @xmath9 of hermitian operators spanned by all the @xmath10 .",
    "this space describes how many density operators we can distinguish with measurements in the given bases .",
    "since @xmath11 for any basis , we expect only @xmath12-dimensions giving new information for each basis , so together with the identity we expect @xmath9 to be @xmath13-dimensional .",
    "if this number is achieved , we will call the chosen basis set _ non - degenerate_. of course , @xmath14 can not exceed the dimension @xmath15 of the space of all hermitian operators on @xmath4 , so for @xmath16 every choice of bases is degenerate in this sense .",
    "the interesting property in this case is that @xmath17 , i.e. , that the set of bases is _ tomographically complete_. of course , for @xmath18 , which is the standard case , non - degeneracy and tomographic completeness are the same property .    for any pair of bases , the values @xmath19 are the joint probabilities of a pair of @xmath0-valued random variables , each of which is uniformly distributed .",
    "we say that a collection of @xmath5 bases _ admits a classical model _ , if these probabilities are marginals of some joint distribution of all @xmath5 variables ( each taking @xmath0 values ) . since this property only involves the absolute values of scalar products , not their phases , and therefore captures only a small part of the information about the relative position of the bases , it is perhaps rather unexpected that the existence of a classical model is very closely linked to the existence of alice s strategy .",
    "this is described in the following theorem , our main result :    let @xmath20 be a collection of @xmath5 orthonormal bases in a @xmath0 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "then + ( 1 ) if the bases are non - degenerate ( in particular , @xmath21 ) and the bases admit a classical model , then alice can find a safe strategy in the mean king s problem with these bases .",
    "+ ( 2 ) conversely , if the set of bases is tomographically complete ( in particular , @xmath22 ) , and if alice has a strategy , then the bases allow a classical model .",
    "+ ( 3 ) in the case ( 1 ) , alice s strategy may begin with a maximally entangled state , and in the case ( 2 ) a pure initial state is necessarily maximally entangled .    before going into the proof ,",
    "let us see what this theorem says about some basic examples .      by definition",
    "a set of @xmath5 bases in @xmath0 dimensions is mutually unbiased if , with the notation from ( [ probs ] ) , we have @xmath23 from this a classical model is obvious , namely @xmath5 _ statistically independent _ uniformly distributed random variables . in order to compute the dimension of the span of the @xmath24 , let us take the @xmath25-matrix of hilbert schmidt scalar products ( defined for operators @xmath26 by @xmath27 ) of these vectors , which is just the expression ( [ mubcond ] ) , interpreted as a matrix @xmath28 .",
    "its rank is the dimension we are looking for , and easily computed as @xmath29 , by determining all eigenvalues of @xmath30 .",
    "hence mubs are non - degenerate for all @xmath21 , and for any number of mubs the mean king can come up with , alice has a strategy .",
    "this result was previously obtained by another method in @xcite .",
    "[ c][c][1][45]@xmath31 [ c][c][1][-30]@xmath32 [ c][c][1][-85]@xmath33 .",
    "the range of triples admitting a classical model is described as tetrahedron inside this body , with the same corners.,title=\"fig : \" ]    another interesting special case , discussed in @xcite , is @xmath2 , @xmath34 .",
    "choosing a basis in @xmath2 is the same as choosing a pair of antipodal points on the bloch sphere .",
    "three bases are tomographically complete iff these points do not lie in a plane .",
    "the existence of a classical model in this case is one of the ancestral problems of quantum information theory , namely precisely the existence of such models for three dichotomic variables characterized by bell s original three - variable inequality @xcite .",
    "the joint distribution ( [ probs ] ) belonging to two bases @xmath35 is characterized ( for @xmath2 ) by the single number @xmath33 .",
    "[ fig : qubitcase ] shows the possible range of triples @xmath36 .",
    "the range of triples admitting a classical model , and hence a safe strategy for alice , is described by bell s inequalities as the tetrahedron inside this body .",
    "if the bases are chosen independently and with unitarily invariant distribution ( haar measure ) , the probability for this subset is exactly @xmath37 .",
    "this can be computed analytically by reducing it to a problem of three independent uniformly distributed vectors on the bloch sphere .",
    "in the first round , alice chooses a hilbert space @xmath38 and prepares a density operator @xmath39 on @xmath40 .",
    "the first system is left to the king s men , who perform their von neumann measurement in one of the bases @xmath41 , leaving a state @xmath42 , conditional on their measured result being @xmath43 .",
    "finally , alice will make a measurement on @xmath40 , with some outcomes @xmath44 .",
    "this is described by positive operators @xmath45 on @xmath40 , with @xmath46 .",
    "the precise nature of the outcomes is irrelevant .",
    "all that counts is that the value @xmath47 provides alice with a rule what to answer , if the king discloses that basis @xmath48 was used by his men .",
    "we can express this by introducing a `` guessing function '' , but we might just as well take the rule itself as the outcome ( possibly grouping together some outcomes leading to the same guesses ) . hence we choose the outcome set @xmath49 with the interpretation that @xmath50 is the answer alice will give , if her measurement gave the value `` @xmath47 '' , and the king discloses @xmath48 .",
    "the requirement that she is right every time is the basic equation for @xmath39 and @xmath45 we have to solve : @xmath51    at this point",
    "we can make the first simplifications .",
    "suppose , for example , that alice has found a solution using a mixed state @xmath39 , and that @xmath52 is some unit vector in the support of @xmath39 , so that @xmath53 for some positive @xmath54 .",
    "then after replacing @xmath39 by @xmath55 , the zeros in ( [ basiceq ] ) will still all be in the right places , and since we chose @xmath52 as a unit vector , we have found a solution with a pure initial state @xmath56 .",
    "next , we write @xmath52 as @xmath57 @xmath58 is the maximally entangled vector , and @xmath59 is an operator , whose matrix elements in a suitable basis of @xmath38 are the vector components of @xmath52 , normalized so that @xmath60 . then in ( [ basiceq ] ) we can commute @xmath59 past the projections acting only on the first factor , and simplify the expression by introducing the vectors @xmath61 where the bar indicates componentwise complex conjugation in the basis @xmath62 , in which @xmath58 takes the form ( [ som ] ) .",
    "then the basic equation ( [ basiceq ] ) becomes @xmath63 now suppose @xmath64 is a vector in the support of the operator in this bracket . then substituting @xmath65 for the operator will still give zero , whenever @xmath66 , and hence @xmath67 but also the scalar products for @xmath68 are essentially fixed : we have @xmath69 for any basis @xmath48 , which translates to @xmath70 via ( [ bshat ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can sum ( [ eta1 ] ) over @xmath43 , obtaining @xmath71 we will call such vectors _ safe vectors _ for alice ( and the particular outcome @xmath47 ) .      how many safe vectors can alice find ?",
    "a key role for answering this question is played by the space @xmath9 introduced in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , or , equivalently by its image @xmath72 under the identification of operators on @xmath4 and elements of @xmath73 : @xmath74 its complex linear span @xmath75 , and its orthogonal complement @xmath76 . for every @xmath44 we arrive at the following alternative : it may happen that there is no vector @xmath64 satisfying ( [ eta2 ] ) with @xmath77 .",
    "then all solutions of that equation are in @xmath76 , which also means that such values @xmath47 can never occur as a result of alice s measurement .",
    "alice s strategy will have to rely on the other cases , i.e. , the subset of those @xmath44 , for which a non - trivial solution @xmath64 of ( [ eta2 ] ) exists . to get a standard solution",
    ", we multiply @xmath64 with a scalar so that @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , we can apply to @xmath64 the orthogonal projection to @xmath75 , thus obtaining a solution which is _ uniquely _ determined , since all scalar products with vectors from this space are fixed .",
    "we note that since all its scalar products with the @xmath79 are real , we can even conclude that @xmath80 .",
    "hence whenever a non - zero solution exists for some @xmath44 , we can pick a unique solution @xmath81 , determined by the conditions @xmath82 the fact that @xmath81 lies in this real - linear subspace means that the corresponding operator on @xmath4 is hermitian , or , expressed in the standard basis that @xmath83 it is clear that if alice can find any safe vectors at all , she has some success at a _ unambiguous retrodiction _ game , in which she is allowed to pass , but has to be absolutely sure of her guess otherwise .",
    "as in the problem of `` unambiguous discrimination '' @xcite her aim would be to minimize the probability for pass moves . in the mean king problem , however , her success probability is required to be unity , which is the same as saying that @xmath46 , and a guess @xmath44 is produced in every run .",
    "the theorem states necessary conditions for the existence of a strategy only in the tomographically complete case .",
    "then @xmath84 , and the only choice alice has is to pick safe vectors , which are multiples of the @xmath81 as in ( [ etax ] ) .",
    "this fixes the operators in ( [ basiceq1 ] ) to be @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "the values for @xmath47 not allowing a non - zero safe vector can be subsumed by setting @xmath87 .",
    "the overall normalization condition @xmath46 then reads @xmath88 taking matrix elements of this equation in the standard basis and using the hermiticity ( [ etaherm ] ) , we find @xmath89 by ( [ normalize ] ) this amounts to @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the matrix of @xmath92 . with @xmath93 we find that @xmath92 is also a multiple of the identity matrix . from the normalization condition @xmath94",
    "this multiple must be @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath92 is just the reduced density operator of the restricted state , we have thus shown item ( 3 ) of the theorem : in the tomographically complete case , the initial state of alice must be maximally entangled .",
    "the connection with classical models is seen by taking the matrix elements of equation ( [ normalize ] ) with other vectors . to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the matrix element with @xmath58 . then , since @xmath96 , and @xmath97 whenever @xmath98 , we get @xmath99 .",
    "hence the @xmath100 must indeed be a probability distribution on @xmath101 , which is the same as the collection of all measurement outcomes .",
    "furthermore , for any bases @xmath35 , and associated outcomes @xmath102 , @xmath103 clearly , the right hand side is exactly the marginal @xmath104 of the probability distribution @xmath105 with respect to the @xmath0-valued variables @xmath48 and @xmath106 . on the other hand , since @xmath96 , the left hand side evaluates to @xmath107 , so @xmath105 is exactly a classical model in the sense described in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem , part ( 2 ) , and the corresponding statement in part ( 3 ) .",
    "let us now suppose , as in part ( 1 ) of the theorem , that we are given @xmath21 bases .",
    "then , for each @xmath47 , ( [ etax ] ) is an inhomogeneous linear system of equations for the vector @xmath81 .",
    "taking only the first @xmath108 equations for each basis , plus one normalization equation @xmath109 eliminates the trivial dependencies between these equations , so we have @xmath29 equations for a vector in @xmath110 . the condition of non - degeneracy described in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] is equivalent to saying that all these equations are non - singular , hence under the hypothesis of part ( 1 ) of the theorem , @xmath81 exists for all @xmath47 .",
    "now suppose that a classical model exists in the form of a set of @xmath86 such that the marginals ( [ nmatel ] ) are consistent with @xmath96 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath110 may now be a proper subspace , and the matrix elements with all @xmath111 do not determine the operator @xmath112 completely .",
    "nevertheless , we can set @xmath113 with @xmath114 summing to the projection onto @xmath76 .",
    "then it is immediate that with a maximally entangled initial state , i.e. , with the choice @xmath115 , the basic equation ( [ basiceq1 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this completes the proof of part ( 1 ) of the theorem .",
    "given the marginals of equation , the existence of a classical model is a linear feasibility program in the @xmath100 .",
    "it can also be cast as a semidefinite program , namely to maximize @xmath116 subject to the constraints @xmath86 and @xmath117 .",
    "if the maximum turns out to be @xmath118 , we have found the desired joint distribution . otherwise , this is the probability for alice to find an answer in the unambiguous retrodiction game described at the end of iii.a .",
    "the following table lists the numerical results for low dimensions with independent haar distributed bases , where @xmath119 is the probability that a safe strategy exists , @xmath120 is the expected overall success probability for unambiguous retrodiction , and @xmath112 is the sample size we used .",
    "higher dimensions , with @xmath121 variables and constraints , are a serious challenge for pc based computation . for @xmath3 ,",
    "a strategy rarely exists , but one can first `` debias '' the bases with a gradient search minimizing @xmath122 . instead of a semidefinite program one",
    "can then use the so - called em - algorithm @xcite to find a joint distribution , and this is typically successful for the debiased case , although convergence is rather slow ."
