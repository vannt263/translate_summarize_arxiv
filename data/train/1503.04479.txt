    "quantum impurity problems have the advantage that they can be solved reliably via a number of well - established techniques .",
    "conformal field theory @xcite , the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite , and the numerical renormalization group @xcite have all been used to calculate entanglement entropy in the kondo and spin - boson models .",
    "quantum impurity models therefore provide a natural setting for systematic study of the interplay between quantum criticality and entanglement entropy .",
    "for example , it has been established using the numerical renormalization - group ( nrg ) method @xcite that @xmath0 exhibits a cusp peak at the quantum critical point ( qcp ) that separates the localized and delocalized phases of the sub - ohmic spin - boson model .",
    "whether or not a cusp peak in @xmath0 at the qcp is a generic feature of continuous impurity quantum phase transitions is an open and intriguing question .",

    "entanglement entropy captures the degree of quantum nonlocality in the ground - state wave function . specifically , it is a property associated with a partition of the system into two regions @xmath6 and @xmath7 that effectively `` cuts '' the ground state along the boundary between the regions . upon tracing the system s density operator @xmath8 over region @xmath7 ,",
    "one obtains the reduced density operator in region @xmath6 , @xmath9 .",

    "the entanglement entropy between the impurity and the rest of the system is defined by taking region a to contain solely the impurity degrees of freedom , while region b describes the host ( i.e. , the rest of the system ) , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "at the other extreme , a state of maximal entanglement between the impurity and its host is described by @xmath28 for all @xmath29 , leading to @xmath30 .",
    "a complication arises if the system is not in a pure state , as is likely to be the case when there is ground - state degeneracy . for example , in the trivial limit where the impurity and the host are decoupled , @xmath31-fold degeneracy of the impurity ground state results in @xmath14 having @xmath31 values @xmath32 and @xmath33 values @xmath25 , implying that @xmath34 . in order to avoid such misleading indications of entanglement , it is necessary to break the ground - state degeneracy of the impurity to obtain a pure state .    in the present work , where we treat magnetic impurities ,",
    "the ground - state degeneracy can be lifted by the application of an infinitesimal local magnetic field @xmath35 that couples solely to the impurity through a hamiltonian term @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the impurity spin operator and the land @xmath38 factor and the bohr magneton have both been set to unity .",

    "this work shows that the charge - susceptibility exponent can be written @xmath404 in terms of the correlation - length exponent @xmath405 , which describes the vanishing of a crossover temperature @xmath406 on approach to the quantum - critical point .    the large-@xmath5 limit of the local - moment fraction is @xmath361 , and not @xmath325 corresponding to the effective degeneracy of three impurity configurations @xmath229 , @xmath407 , and @xmath408 .",
    "this is because for @xmath409 , the many - body ground state contains equal admixtures of @xmath410 and @xmath411 .      the locations @xmath351 of extrema in @xmath177 , as well as the extremal values themselves , are weakly dependent on the wilson discretization parameter @xmath412 employed in the nrg calculations .",
    "the nrg results quoted in section [ sec : ander ] were computed for @xmath413 . we have determined for @xmath212 , @xmath356 , and @xmath414 , that reducing @xmath412 from @xmath415 to @xmath416 shifts the peak in @xmath177 from @xmath417 to @xmath418 . that this shift is to a slightly _ larger _ @xmath135 value provides evidence that the displacement of the peak away from the quantum critical point is not merely an artifact of the nrg , and that a nonzero displacement would survive in the continuum limit @xmath419 ."
