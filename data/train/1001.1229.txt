    "the study of a fourth generation of quarks and leptons has undergone a renaissance .",
    "while earlier studies @xcite claimed that the fourth generation was ruled out by experimental data , a recent analysis  @xcite has shown that the constraints can be satisfied by appropriate choices of mass splittings between the new fourth generation particles .",
    "furthermore , the existence of the fourth generation can help to address certain discrepancies between the standard model and experimental results in the b - quark sector@xcite , leading to a revival of interest in this possibility ( see @xcite for a review ) .    in view of the imminent arrival of lhc data ,",
    "it is of particular interest to search for signals of these fourth - generation fermions at hadron colliders .",
    "such analyses have been performed for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks .",
    "cdf has searched for the @xmath14 quark  @xcite using the ckm suppressed decay @xmath16 and for the @xmath15 quark  @xcite using the process @xmath17 which can yield like - sign dileptons .",
    "these searches have set limits of 311 gev for the @xmath14  @xcite , and 338 gev for the @xmath15  @xcite ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the lhc will discover or exclude fourth generation quarks up to about a tev @xcite .",
    "however , few detailed analyses have been performed in the lepton sector . by analogy with the first three generations",
    ", one might expect the leptons of the fourth generation to be lighter than the fourth generation quarks and in particular , the fourth generation neutrino might be expected to be the lightest new particle .",
    "it is of interest to see if this neutrino can be found at colliders .",
    "past searches for fourth generation neutrinos have mainly been performed at lepton colliders . in particular ,",
    "lep ii has looked for neutrinos produced in the process @xmath18 , where the neutrinos subsequently decay via the process @xmath19 .",
    "no excess of such events was found , which placed a limit of about 100 gev for dirac neutrinos decaying to electrons , muons or taus . for majorana",
    "neutrinos the corresponding limits were about 90 gev if the neutrino decayed either to electrons or to muons , and about 80 gev if it decayed to taus .",
    "theoretical analyses of fourth generation neutrinos at hadron colliders @xcite have focused on the process @xmath20 where the fourth generation neutrino is produced in association with a light charged lepton .",
    "this process has the significant advantage that only one heavy particle is produced , which increases the mass reach considerably .",
    "furthermore , the neutrino will decay through @xmath21 which will produce the low - background like - sign dilepton signature in half the events .    however , the production cross - section for this process depends on the mixing between the fourth generation with the first three generations due to the @xmath22 vertex . in many models ,",
    "this mixing angle can be small ; for example , if the mixing is generated by gut or planck - scale suppressed operators , the angle may be as small as @xmath23 @xcite . for mixing parameters smaller than about @xmath24 ,",
    "the neutrino production rates in this channel are too small to be observable at colliders  @xcite . in models with small mixing angles ,",
    "the dominant production mechanism becomes pair production through an @xmath1-channel @xmath2 , for which the production rate is model - independent .",
    "these signals have been studied at various benchmark points for the lhc  @xcite and for future linear colliders  @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of the @xmath1-channel @xmath2 process has not been performed for the tevatron . in this letter , we present a sensitivity study for the tevatron and argue that the lep limits on majorana neutrinos can be significantly improved with an analysis of the data already taken .",
    "it would be of great interest to perform a full analysis of this data .",
    "we also perform a similar study for the lhc , which can probe the parameter space to much higher energies .",
    "we consider an extension to the standard model by a fourth generation of fermions and a right - handed neutrino .",
    "the mass term for the neutrinos can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "this theory has two mass eigenstates of masses @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , the mass of the fourth generation lepton is constrained to be close in mass to the neutrinos by precision electroweak constraints  @xcite .",
    "we consider processes where only the lightest neutrino is produced , providing the most model - independent bound on this theory . in future work",
    ", we will study the effect of the second neutrino and fourth generation lepton .",
    "for this analysis , we treat the lepton and second neutrino as infinitely massive , corresponding to a limit where @xmath28 go to infinity with @xmath29 fixed .",
    "the lighter neutrino mass eigenstate is the majorana fermion @xmath30 .",
    "the coupling for pair production via the @xmath2 is through the coupling @xmath31 where    @xmath32    the heavy neutrino will decay through @xmath33 ( the neutral current process is suppressed . ) note that @xmath0 can decay to either sign of lepton , giving like - sign leptons in half of the events , see fig  [ fig : prod ] .",
    "we assume that the heavy neutrino decays promptly ; this will be the case unless the mixing between the fourth generation and the first three is extremely small @xcite .",
    "we consider the possible decay modes @xmath34 . in a hadron collider ,",
    "backgrounds to @xmath35 leptons are much larger and efficiencies are much lower than for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , giving the @xmath35 decay mode little power .",
    "we consider two cases , ( a ) @xmath38 , in which the non-@xmath35 decays appear solely as muons : br(@xmath39 ) = 1 - br(@xmath40 ) ; and ( b ) @xmath41 , with @xmath42 in which the non-@xmath35 decays appear as both electrons and muons : br(@xmath39 ) + br(@xmath43 ) = 1 - br(@xmath40 ) .",

    "if the @xmath0 decays to @xmath47 , then the decay of @xmath48 can be categorized by the decays of the @xmath49 bosons .",
    "if both @xmath49s decay hadronically , we expect approximately 4 jets .",
    "if one decays leptonically , we expect approximately 2 jets and a third lepton .",
