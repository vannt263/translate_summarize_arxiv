    "the ferrites materials have been widely used as various electronic devices such as inductors , transformers , and electromagnetic wave absorbers in the relatively high - frequency region up to a few hundreds of mhz .",
    "the electromagnetic theory can be used to describe the macroscopic properties of matter .",
    "the electromagnetic fields may be characterized by four vectors : electric field * e * , magnetic flux density * b * , electric flux density * d * , and magnetic field * h * , which at ordinary points satisfy maxwell s equations",
    ".    the ferrite media under study can be considerer as linear , homogeneous , and isotropic .",
    "the relation between the vectors * b * and * h * can be expressed as : * b * = @xmath0*h * . where @xmath1 is the magnetic permeability of the material .",
    "another important parameter for magnetic materials is magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 which relates the magnetization vector m to the magnetic field vector * h * by the relationship : * m * = @xmath3 * h * .",
    "magnetic permeability @xmath1 and magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 are related by the formula : @xmath4 .",
    "magnetic materials in sinusoidal fields have , in fact , magnetic losses and this can be expressed taking @xmath1 as a complex parameter:@xmath5 @xcite    in the frequency range from rf to microwaves , the complex permeability spectra of the ferrites can be characterized by two different magnetization mechanisms : domain wall motion and gyromagnetic spin rotation .",
    "domain wall motion contribution to susceptibility can be studied through an equation of motion in which pressure is proportional to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "assuming that the magnetic field has harmonic excitation @xmath6 , the contribution of domain wall to the susceptibility @xmath7 is :    @xmath8       here , @xmath9 is the magnetic susceptibility for domain wall , @xmath10 is the resonance frequency of domain wall contribution , @xmath11 is the static magnetic susceceptibility , @xmath12 is the damping factor and @xmath13 is the frequency of the external magnetic field .",
    "gyromagnetic spin contribution to magnetic susceptibility can be studied through a magnetodynamic equation @xcite@xcite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath14 can be expressed as :    @xmath15    here , @xmath14 is the magnetic susceptibility for gyromagnetic spin , @xmath16 is the resonance frequency of spin contribution , @xmath17 is the static magnetic susceptibility , and @xmath18 is the damping factor and @xmath13 is the frequency of the external magnetic field .",
    "the total magnetic permeability results @xcite :    @xmath19       separating the real and the imaginary parts of equation ( [ eq : modelo ] ) we get :    @xmath20    @xmath21    magnetic losses , represented by the imaginary part of the magnetic permeability , can be extremely small ; however , they are always present unless we consider vacuum @xcite . from a physics point of view , the existing relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath23 reflects that the mechanisms of energy storage and dissipation are two aspects of the same phenomenon @xcite .",
    "genetic algorithms ( ga ) are probabilistic search procedures which generate solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution , such as inheritance , mutation , selection , and crossover .",
    "a ga allows a population composed of many individuals evolve according to selection rules designed to maximize `` fitness '' or minimize a `` cost function '' .",
    "a path through the components of ag is shown as a flowchart in figure ( [ fig : diagramaflujo ] )          a cost function generates an output from a set of input variables ( a chromosome ) .",
    "the cost function s object is to modify the output in some desirable fashion by finding the appropriate values for the input variables .",
    "the cost function in this work is the difference between the experimental value of the permeability and calculated using the parameters obtained by the genetic algorithm .    to begin the ag",
    "is randomly generated an initial population of chromosomes .",
    "this population is represented by a matrix in which each row is a chromosome that contains the variables to optimize , in this work , the parameters of permeability model .",
    "@xcite      survival of the fittest translates into discarding the chromosomes with the highest cost .",
    "first , the costs and associated chromosomes are ranked from lowest cost to highest cost .",
    "then , only the best are selected to continue , while the rest are deleted .",
    "the selection rate , is the fraction of chromosomes that survives for the next step of mating .",
    "now two chromosomes are selected from the set surviving to produce two new offspring which contain traits from each parent .",
    "chromosomes with lower cost are more likely to be selected from the chromosomes that survive natural selection .",
    "offsprings are born to replace the discarded chromosomes      the simplest methods choose one or more points in the chromosome to mark as the crossover points .",
    "then the variables between these points are merely swapped between the two parents .",
    "crossover points are randomly selected .",
    "if care is not taken , the ga can converge too quickly into one region of a local minimum of the cost function rather than a global minimum . to avoid this problem of overly fast convergence",
    ", we force the routine to explore other areas of the cost surface by randomly introducing changes , or mutations , in some of the variables .      the process described is iterated until an acceptable solution is found .",
    "the individuals of the new generation ( selected , crossed and mutated ) repeat the whole process until it reaches a termination criterion . in this case",
    ", we consider a maximum number of iterations or a predefined acceptable solution ( whichever comes first )",
    "@xmath24 samples were prepared via sol - gel method with x=0.01 , 0.02 , and 0.05 .",
    "the complex permeability of the samples was measured in a material analyzer hp4251 in the range of 1mhz to 1 ghz.@xcite .",
    "the experimental data of magnetic permeability have been used for fitting the parameters of the model @xcite .",
    "firstly , we fitted the magnetic losses based in equation ( [ muimag ] ) by the genetic algoritm method and we obtained the six fitting parameters .",
    "we substituted , then , these six parameters into equation ( [ mureal ] ) to calculate the real part of permeability .",
    "where @xmath13 is the frequency of the external magnetic field , y @xmath9 , @xmath14 , @xmath25 , @xmath16 , @xmath12 @xmath18 are unknown parameters , the problem is to estimate these from a set of pairs of experimental:@xmath27 .",
    "the cost function was the mistake made in calculating @xmath28 with the expression ( [ muimag ] ) using the parameters obtained from the genetic algorithm and the experimental value of @xmath29 for each frequency .",
    "2000 iterations were performed , with a population of 300 chromosomes ( each with 6 variables ) .",
    "the fraction of the population that was replaced by children in each iteration was 0.5 and the fraction of mutations was 0.25 .",
    "the figure [ fig : mincost ] shows the evolution of the error in successive iterations , we graphed the minimum value of function cost in the population for each iteration .",
    "it show that the error converges at minimum value quickly , and then this value is stable .",
    "although in the equations ( [ muimag ] ) and ( [ mureal ] ) , @xmath10 and @xmath16 must be in hz , we calculate in mhz and then multiplied in the equations by @xmath31 , the same treatment we performed with the parameter beta , we calculate its value in the range between 1 and 2000 , although in equations we multiplied by @xmath32 . this treatment was necessary for that",
