    "random processes describe a wide spectrum of phenomena in complex systems @xcite .",
    "diffusion processes , for instance , are used to understand trajectories of one- or multi - dimensional fluctuating observables or order parameters in a great variety of contexts within and outside physics .",
    "the validity of such diffusive descriptions  often applicable with impressive precision to real - world systems  is based on the assumption that the probability of future events depends only on the present state of the system  @xcite .",
    "constraints have an influence on such processes , as they limit the phase space that can be reached from a given state .    in one - dimensional diffusion processes , constraints on diffusing quantities",
    "are typically embodied by _ hard bounds _ ,",
    "i.e. , by strict limits that the diffusing variable can not overcome , irrespectively of how close or distant to the boundaries the variable already is . the presence of bounds can alter qualitatively the properties of a system .",
    "it is well known that absorbing or reflecting boundary conditions affect the basic properties or a random walk , e.g. creating steady - state distributions and affecting first - passage times .",
    "additional more subtle and intriguing phenomena may emerge with hard bounds .",
    "for example , a random ( diffusional ) one - dimensional multiplicative process , in presence of a lower bound , can give rise to power - law distributions for the value of the variable at a given time  @xcite .",
    "however , one can imagine a system where the constraints are not embodied by hard bounds , but follow a different type of behavior .",
    "for example discrete diffusion steps may be limited differently depending on the configuration they start from . recently , we found empirical evidence of precisely this behavior , which we termed _ soft bound _",
    "@xcite . note that while a classical physical example of constrained diffusion is a brownian particle confined in a box , whose motion is continuous in time , in other ( often less tangible ) examples , such as stock prices  @xcite or the population of a city  @xcite , the quantity of interest is naturally measured at discrete time intervals , and its evolution is best described by finite - sized discrete jumps . as we will see , the difference between hard and soft bounds is relevant for time - discrete diffusion processes and we will thus consider this case here .",
    "the scope of this work is to explore some of the basic theoretical consequences of diffusion with soft bounds .",
    "it is important to stress that the precise definition of a soft bound  as we formulate it here  is motivated by compelling empirical evidence @xcite .",
    "the reasons for the emergence of such a behavior constitute a partially unsolved problem ( see the discussion section ) and are not the main focus here . instead",
    ", the motivation for the present study is an exploration of its effects . in particular",
    ", we present a description of the general features of the stationary state , aided by the analytical solution in a simple case , and we show that a soft upper bound on diffusion causes a slowly saturating dynamics for the maximum . specifically , we show that detailed balance is broken , and a net local probability current of purely entropic origin is established ( which suggests a novel rationalization of the `` cope s law , '' a much debated feature of body mass evolution ) . additionally , the steady - state distribution under a soft bound can not be obtained from a model with a hard bound and an effective drift , and thus has to be regarded as qualitatively distinct from previously known phenomenology .",
    "finally , the dynamics of the maximum follows exactly the gompertz function , a generalized logistic curve used in diverse contexts and observed empirically .",
    "these findings can be used to recognize soft bounds in real - world systems .",
    "finally we argue how a generic allometric scaling mechanism can generate soft bounds .",
    "we start by introducing the concept of soft bound through a brief review of the recent empirical evidence suggesting its existence .",
    "the first system where the phenomenon of a soft bound emerges from empirical data is the dynamics of software packages , the individual bundled pieces of software that make up an operating system , such as linux  @xcite .",
    "packages change their sizes during their lifespan , as a result of development , maintenance , or repackaging .",
    "thus , the scalar variable `` size '' recapitulates the result of a possibly long and complex series of operations and processes acting on a package .",
    "a natural time interval is set by the distance between consecutive package releases : the size @xmath0 ( for instance in bytes ) of a given package in a release can be compared to the size @xmath1 of that same package in the following release , defining a _ jump _ @xmath2 . for ubuntu linux packages ,",
    "these jumps are distributed in a strikingly regular way .",
    "while the bulk of their distribution does not depend on time nor on the starting size @xmath0 , its tails are cut - off in a size - dependent way . for jumps towards lower sizes ,",
    "one expects that the size of a package can not become smaller than some system - wide minimum @xmath3 , i.e. the lower bound is a hard bound .",
    "this implies that @xmath4 ( the lower bound on the jumps is inversely proportional to the starting size ) and this is indeed found in data . however , the same behavior has not been observed for the upper tail of the distribution .",
    "in fact , the cut - off for jumps to larger sizes is defined by @xmath5 , with exponent @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the larger a package is , the larger it can become in one step , i.e. , the maximum attainable size in one step moves further away for increasingly larger packages ( fig .  [ figure : softbound ] ) .",
    "illustration of the `` soft bound '' mechanism . in the drawing",
    ", the dashed lines stand for the extremal attainable size @xmath0 in either direction ( represented by both circle size and position along the interval ) in a single jump , from different initial conditions .",
    "jumps within these limits follow an assigned jump - size distribution .",
    "the left - hand side of the interval is conditioned by a conventional hard bound : the minimal size @xmath3 can be reached in a single step starting from any initial size . by contrast , the right - hand part of the interval is limited by a soft bound , as the maximum size attainable in one step depends on the starting size . as a consequence , the absolute maximum @xmath7 can not be reached in one step from any initial size , but it can only be approached asymptotically . ]    more formally , in a one - dimensional multiplicative discrete diffusion process limited by a lower hard bound and an upper soft bound , as motivated by the case of linux package size , the bounds can be expressed by the formula @xmath8 regardless of the probability distribution for the jumps @xmath9 , such a multiplicative process can be written in an additive form by a logarithmic transformation . by setting @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , the hard and soft bounds ( [ eq : multiplicative_softbound ] )",
    "are then expressed by @xmath14 which makes evident the fact that the lower bound @xmath15 is a hard bound while the upper one depends on the starting point @xmath16 . in the following ,",
    "unless otherwise specified , we will refer to this additive version of the process .",
    "a second empirical system that is consistent with the diffusion under soft bounds ( although data are much sparser ) is the evolution of body masses for mammalian species  @xcite . here , the time steps are fixed by the speciation events ; the `` jumps '' are realized during cladogenesis between the mass @xmath0 ( in kilograms ) of a mother species , and the mass @xmath1 of the daughter species @xcite .",
    "a notable consequence of the assumption of a soft upper bound in this context is that evolution of mammalian species requires longer time ( i.e. , more speciation events ) to attain large increases in body mass , than it does for large decreases .",
    "this macro - evolutionary asymmetry has been observed in fossil data : the tendency to extreme dwarfism , for instance on islands , is more common than the opposite trend  @xcite .",
    "we now define more technically the diffusion process of interest .",
    "the formal framework is that of markov chains . to fix the notation ,",
    "let @xmath17 denote the transition kernel , i.e. , the probability to jump from position @xmath16 to @xmath18 , and let @xmath19 be the state of the system , i.e. , the density distribution of the diffusing particles at time @xmath20 , e.g. the ( logarithmic ) package sizes or species masses .",
    "this is an inherently discrete process , hence @xmath20 takes only integer values .",
    "state space , instead , is continuous in general . the evolution is then given by @xmath21 we will consider jump probabilities @xmath17 which are the superposition of two components : ( i ) an underlying transition probability @xmath22 , which is translationally invariant and does not necessarily have a bounded domain , and ( ii ) the bounding kernel @xmath23 , which can be written in terms of a characteristic function as @xmath24}(x).\\ ] ] @xmath17 is then obtained by normalizing the product of the two kernels : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the position - dependent normalization @xmath27 the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath16 makes it difficult in general to find analytic solutions to the evolution , even in the long - time limit .",

    "we speculate that the soft bound mechanism can occur in situations where the concerted action of many degrees of freedom is proxied by low- or one - dimensional variables ( such as `` size '' or `` mass '' ) .",
    "in this view , a single jump in size can be seen as the result of a large number of changes in a high - dimensional parameter space , each subject to complex hard bounds ( which are more natural to picture ) , which concur to give rise to the soft bound phenomenon .",
    "another remarkable feature of a discrete - time diffusion process with soft bounds is the non - reversibility ( somewhat analogous to the asymmetry found in the kinetic proofreading @xcite ) , giving rise to a probability flux of entropic nature .",
    "interestingly , this entropic unbalance , which is naturally present in our model , can provide an alternative ( purely entropic ) explanation of the cope s rule for mammalian evolution .",
    "to conclude , we address a possible generic mechanism that could give rise to soft bounds .",
    "let us consider a complex interacting system with many components or agents , where a scalar order parameter @xmath0 , which we can term `` size , '' effectively follows a discrete diffusion process .",
    "this variable can be for instance the number of lines of a software project , or the mean mass of an animal species , the number of workers in a firm or the number of inhabitants in a city .",
    "we suppose that there exists a function , similar to a power in non - equilibrium thermodynamics , estimating the `` effort '' @xmath150 that is put into the system for a given span of time .",
    "for example the effort can be proxied by the total man - hours spent on the code by programmers , or the food intake of an animal , or the money spent by a firm or city administration .",
    "we further assume that a scaling relation @xmath151 holds between effort and size , where @xmath129 is an exponent associated to @xmath150 .",
    "this assumption can be seen as an instance of _ allometric scaling _ , a feature commonly found in complex systems , where some quantity has a power - law dependence on size .",
    "it is observed for instance in general ontogenetic growth and the metabolic rates of animals @xcite ( albeit with some deviations @xcite ) , transportation networks @xcite , and city organization @xcite .",
    "this relation expresses the principle that the total amount of effort available for the system per unit time can scale sub- or super - linearly with size , with respectively @xmath152 and @xmath153 ; for the case at hand we suppose @xmath154 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : allometric_e ] ) , in a thermodynamic interpretation , is different from a green - kubo relation where @xmath155 strictly .",
    "we assume the underlying hypothesis that the effort flow is used both for maintaining the system and for increasing its size ; the maximum increase , corresponding to exhausting all available effort , thus satisfies @xmath156 where the two constants @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the efforts per unit size needed for maintenance and development respectively .",
    "therefore the maximum multiplicative size change attainable in a given time span is @xmath159 if the two cost constants are similar ( @xmath160 ) , or when @xmath9 is large , eq .",
    "( [ eq : allometric_bound ] ) is just the soft bound eq .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicative_softbound ] ) , with @xmath161 and @xmath162 . in brief",
    ", this argument shows that a scaling hypothesis on the relation between effort - rate and size implies a multiplicative soft bound ( similar to the one suggested by both software and mammal mass ) .",
    "we anticipate that the `` effort '' is not necessarily an abstract quantity , but can be possibly measured in different systems . for example , data is available on the number , extent and frequency of updates of software packages .",
    "thus , the above argument may be ( in line of principle ) testable , and opens a question for future work .",
