    "coagulation models describe the dynamics of cluster growth . particles carrying different masses move freely through space , and every time any two of them get sufficiently close there is some chance that they coagulate into a single particle , which will be charged with the sum of the masses of the original pair .    in 1916 , smoluchowski @xcite considered the model of brownian particles moving independently in three - dimensional space , such that any pair coagulates into one particle upon collision .",
    "he derived a system of equations , known as smoluchowski s coagulation equations , that describes the time evolution of the average concentration @xmath0 of particles carrying a given mass @xmath1 in this original work , smoluchowski ignored the effect of spatial fluctuations in the mass concentrations , the equations we write below are thus a natural extension allowing diffusion in the space variables : @xmath2 the differentiated term on the right describes the free motion of a particle with attached mass @xmath3 as a brownian motion with diffusivity rate @xmath4 .",
    "the kernel @xmath5 is determined by physical considerations , it regulates the intensity of the coagulation dynamics .",
    "the first sum corresponds to the increase in the concentration resulting from the coagulation of two particles whose masses add up to @xmath3 .",
    "the second sum reflects the decrease caused by the coalescence of a particle carrying mass @xmath3 with any other particle in the system .",
    "coagulation phenomena have been studied in many fields of the applied science ; we refer to aldous s review @xcite for a comprehensive survey of the literature .",
    "this paper is concerned with the approximation of smoluchowski s equations by stochastic particle models .",
    "concretely , we are interested in identifying the solution to the coagulation equations as the mass density of a system of interacting particles , when the particle number tends to infinity . this problem has been much studied in the spatially homogeneous case , both for discrete and continuous mass distributions , and with different choices of coagulation kernel @xmath5 ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the relevant stochastic process for these models is the marcus and lushnikov process @xcite ; this is the pure jump markov process where clusters of size @xmath3 and @xmath6 coagulate into a single cluster of size @xmath7 at rate @xmath8 .    in the spatially inhomogeneous case ,",
    "on the other hand , the coagulation mechanism is highly dependent on the relative position of the particles , hence the space dynamics plays a predominant role in the particle interactions of the stochastic system . in the original problem proposed by smoluchowski , for instance , pairwise collisions and the ensuing coagulation events",
    "are completely determined by the brownian paths . the first result for this model",
    "was obtained in 1980 by lang and xanh @xcite for the case of discrete mass and constant @xmath9 , in the limit of constant mean free time .",
    "no progress was made until the forthcoming paper @xcite , where norris proves convergence for both discrete and continuous mass distributions , and variable coefficients in a class that includes the brownian case .    over the past few years",
    "there has been considerable interest in spatial models with stochastic dynamics of coagulation . in these models ,",
    "particles coagulate at some rate while they remain at less than a prescribed distance .",
    "deaconu and fournier @xcite consider the case when this distance is independent of the particle number , and let it go to zero after taking the weak limit .",
    "the moderate limit , where the range of interaction is long in the microscopic scale , is studied by grosskinsky , klingenberg and oelschlger in @xcite in a regime where the dominating particle interaction are shattering collisions . in the articles @xcite , hammond and rezakhanlou work in the constant mean free time limit , for dimensions @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a diffusion model where coagulation occurs on collision as a result of a random event : @xmath11 mass - charged particles perform independent one - dimensional diffusions , and whenever two particles are at the same location they may coagulate at a positive rate in their intersection local time .",
    "the new particle is assigned the sum of the masses of the incoming particles , and the process continues .",
    "this model is motivated by the problem of establishing the large - scale dynamics of a system of brownian particles confined to a thin tube , interacting through pairwise coagulation when any two of them get close enough .",
    "it would be interesting to determine whether , under proper scaling of the tube and particle radii in terms of the system size @xmath11 , the higher - dimensional model can be replaced by the simpler one - dimensional one .    note that in one dimension the problem of instantaneous coagulation on collision is not interesting : due to the recurrence properties of the one - dimensional brownian path , in the limit we would instantaneously see the distribution of the total mass in the system among clusters of macroscopic size .",
    "in fact , in order to keep the average time @xmath12 during which a tagged particle does not undergo a collision constant , it is necessary to set coagulation rates which are inversely proportional to the particle number @xmath11 .",
    "the model under consideration is thus of the constant mean free time type , and in this sense it is a one - dimensional version of the models studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we treat the case where the mass dependent diffusivity rates blow up as the mass goes to zero , combined with our choice of rates , this leads to a large - scale model favoring coagulation of large and small particles .",
    "we describe the particle system and state the main results of the paper in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "section [ sec3 ] contains a compactness result .",
    "the next step in the analysis is to prove convergence to a hydrodynamic limit .",
    "this is shown to verify a spatial version of the mass flow equation , which is closely related to smoluchowski s coagulation equation .",
    "this is the content of section [ sec4 ] . in section [ sec5 ]",

    "the dynamics is well defined except for those configurations where two or more coagulation events occur simultaneously .",
    "let us briefly show that the set of such configurations has measure zero and can therefore be neglected .",
    "we first show that this is the case on the time interval @xmath59 $ ] , when @xmath60 .",

    "fix two pairs of indices @xmath43 and @xmath63 .",
    "if the four indices are different , then @xmath62 and @xmath64 perform independent diffusions , and from the fact that point sets are polar for brownian motion in @xmath65 or higher dimensions it follows that these diffusions do no vanish at the same time .",

    "the previous argument implies that with probability 1 they never vanish simultaneously , and hence the same applies to @xmath62 and @xmath70 .",

    "is given by @xmath88      the reason for the choice of scaling of the coagulation rate is quite straighforward : if a hydrodynamic description is to hold , then it is necessary that @xmath89 mass charged particles remain in the system at all times ( note that although total mass is conserved , the number of particles carrying positive mass decreases by one after each coagulation event ) .",
    "therefore a generic particle will see some fraction of the other @xmath89 mass charged particles over any fixed time interval , while it would still be expected to coagulate with only @xmath90 of them .",
