    "the microscopic understanding of the effect of charge carrier doping on spin@xmath0 antiferromagnetic ( afm ) mott insulators is the central issue of the high - temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "@xcite many puzzling experimental features of these systems @xcite suggest that a fundamental law of nature remains to be recognized .",
    "extremely low doping ( @xmath1 charge carriers per site ) leads to a complete destruction of the long - range afm order , and a transition to an unusual non - fermi - liquid metal .",
    "this unusual metal becomes superconducting , with the transition temperature @xmath2 strongly dependent on the doping @xmath3 .",
    "the maximum @xmath2 is reached for dopings around @xmath4 . for higher dopings",
    "the critical temperature decreases to zero , and in the overdoped region a crossover towards a ( non - superconducting ) fermi - liquid takes place .",
    "two central questions require resolution .",
    "the first one concerns the nature of the charge carriers responsible for this non - fermi - liquid metallic behavior .",
    "this is a fundamental issue , since it lies outside the framework of landau s fermi - liquid theory and it necessitates understanding the appearance of non - quasiparticle - like charge carriers in a system of interacting electrons .",
    "the second question concerns the nature of strong attractive pairing between these charge carriers , given the purely repulsive interaction between the constituent electrons . in conventional superconductors ,",
    "the pairing attraction is due to overscreening of the electron - electron coulomb repulsion by the ionic lattice . in the case of the high - temperature superconducting cuprates , it has been suggested @xcite that pairing is an intrinsic property of the electron gas itself mediated by afm spin - fluctuations of the doped system .",
    "accordingly , the challenge is to identify a strong attractive force based purely on repulsive coulomb interactions . in this paper",
    ", we derive such a force and demonstrate that it leads to d - wave pairing of charge carrying holes introduced by doping a quantum , spin-@xmath5 , mott - hubbard antiferromagnet .",
    "the simplest model hamiltonians used to investigate the cuprate physics are the hubbard model and the closely related t - j model . unlike the 1d problem , an exact solution for the 2d hubbard hamiltonian is not known . as a result ,",
    "various approximations are necessary .",
    "although the application of the mean - field theory has been severely criticized in this context , it provides a valuable reference point for incorporating fluctuation effects .",
    "moreover , even for the 1d hubbard model , essential features of the exact solution may be recaptured by judiciously incorporating fluctuation and tunneling effects into mean - field theory .",
    "@xcite the most straightforward mean - field theory is the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) . at half - filling ( @xmath6 )",
    "the hfa predicts an afm mott insulator ground - state .",
    "as the system is doped , hfa suggests that charge carrier holes in the afm background assemble in charged stripes , which are quasi - one - dimensional structures .",
    "@xcite a large effort has been devoted to studying these charged stripes and relating them to certain features of the cuprates .",
    "@xcite    recently , a more fundamental investigation of the many - electron problem has suggested the possibility of an alternative model hamiltonian for the cuprate physics .",
    "this model hamiltonian , called the spin - flux model , @xcite suggests that the long - range coulomb interaction between spin-@xmath5 electrons leads to qualitative new physics , not apparent in the conventional hubbard model ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the results of the hartree - fock study @xcite of this spin - flux model are summarized in section 3 .",
    "they suggests that the undoped parent compound is also an afm mott insulator .",
    "however , unlike the conventional hubbard model , the one - electron dispersion relations of the afm mean - field in the spin - flux model match those measured experimentally through angle - resolved photo - emission for undoped cuprates .",
    "a proper description of the highest occupied electronic states ( as provided by the spin - flux model ) , is crucial to considerations of doping .",
    "the spin - flux model and the conventional hubbard model differ dramatically in this regard . at the hf level",
    ", the doping holes added to the afm background of the spin - flux model are trapped in the core of antiferromagnetic spin vortices .",
    "this composite object ( meron - vortex ) is a bosonic charged collective mode of the many - electron system ( the total spin of the magnetic vortex is zero ) .",
    "the reversal of the spin - charge connection provides a microscopic basis for non - fermi - liquid behavior .    a magnetic vortex is strongly attracted to an antivortex .",
    "this attraction increases logarithmically with the distance between the vortex cores , and is stronger than the unscreened coulomb repulsion between the charge meron - vortex cores . in effect , the increase in coulomb energy between a given pair of holes is more than offset by the lowering in exchange energy between the background electrons as their vortices approach each other from far away .",
    "as the inter - vortex distance increases , more and more spins are rotated out of their afm background orientation and the total energy of the system increases .",
    "thus , even at the hf level , the spin - flux model provides a fundamental underpinning for the origin of both non - fermi - liquid behavior , and strong pairing between the charge carriers .",
    "while providing a good starting point , the hartree - fock approximation also has serious shortcomings .",
    "for instance , the ground - state wavefunction in the presence of doping is non - homogeneous ( the static meron - vortices of the spin - flux model , or the charged stripes of the conventional hubbard model , break translational symmetry ) .",
    "physically , one expects that these charge carriers can move along the planes , resulting in a wavefunction which preserves the translational symmetry of the original hamiltonian .",
    "quantum dynamics of the charge carriers also determines whether the doped ground - state is really a metal .",
    "charge carriers in the optimally doped cuprates are quite mobile excitations , although their scattering rates are radically different from electrons in a conventional fermi liquid .",
    "a consistent way of treating the quantum dynamics of the charge carriers is provided by the configuration interaction ( ci ) method,@xcite described in section 4 . here , a linear combination of hf wavefunctions is used in order to restore the various broken symmetries .",
    "for instance , in a doped system the ci wavefunction is chosen to be a linear combination of hf wavefunctions with the charge carrier localized at different sites .",
    "certain types of charge carriers can lower their total energy substantially by quantum mechanically hopping from one site to the next .",
    "we tested the accuracy of the ci method against the exact solution @xcite of the one - dimensional hubbard model in reference 3 . in the 1d hubbard model",
    "the ci method describes the quantum dynamics of charged domain wall solitons in the afm background . by including these effects as fluctuation corrections to the hartree - fock mean - field theory",
    ", the ci method provides excellent agreement with the exact bethe ansatz solution for the ground - state energy of the doped 1d hubbard chain , over the entire @xmath7 range .",
    "the ci method also leads to a clear demonstration of the spin - charge separation in 1d .",
    "addition of one doping hole to the half - filled antiferromagnetic chain results in the appearance of two different carriers : a charged bosonic domain - wall ( which carries the charge but no spin ) and a neutral spin-1/2 domain wall ( which carries the spin but no charge ) .",
    "this study @xcite demonstrates the effectiveness of the ci method . in this paper",
    "we use the ci method to investigate dynamics of the charged meron - vortices in the spin - flux model . throughout this paper",
    "we exploit and refer to the analogy between the charge excitations of the 1d hubbard model and the 2d spin - flux model , @xcite apparent in the ci approach .",
    "@xcite the ci results for the spin - flux model ( presented in section 4 ) confirm that the meron - vortices are very mobile , suggesting that a collection of such mobile bosonic charge carriers is a non - fermi - liquid metal .",
    "the ci method also allows us to identify the rotational symmetry of the meron - antimeron pair wavefunction to be d - wave for the most stable pairs .",
    "an energetically more expensive metastable s - wave pairing is also possible .",
    "the possibility of spin - charge separation in 2d is elucidated .",
    "a summary of the results , their interpretation and conclusions is provided in section 5 .",
    "the effective 2d hamiltonian that we use to describe the strongly correlated electrons residing in the @xmath8 orbitals of the isolated cuo@xmath9 plane is the tight - binding model : @xmath10 where @xmath11 creates an electron at site @xmath12 with spin @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the hopping amplitude from site @xmath15 to site @xmath12 on the square lattice , @xmath16 is the total number of electrons at site @xmath12 , and @xmath17 is the coulomb interaction between electrons at sites @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "the dominant terms are the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath18 and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath19 . if only these two terms are considered , and we shift the chemical potential by @xmath20 , this reduces to the well - known hubbard model .",
    "the neglect of all longer range coulomb interaction ( @xmath21 , if @xmath22 ) , in the hubbard model , is based on the fermi - liquid theory notion of screening of the effective electron - electron interaction .",
    "however , fermi liquid theory fails to explain many of the crucial features of the high - t@xmath23 cuprates . in our description",
    ", we include the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion , which we assume is on the energy scale of @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to the generation of spin - flux , an entirely new type of broken symmetry in the many - electron system , which we show leads naturally to bosonic charge carriers in the form of meron - vortices , non - fermi - liquid behavior and a strong attractive pairing force between holes in the afm background . in order to extract the relevant physics from our starting hamiltonian , @xmath25 we introduce bilinear combination of electron operators @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath27 , for @xmath22 ( summation over multiple indexes is assumed ) .",
    "here @xmath28 is the @xmath29 identity matrix and @xmath30 are the usual pauli spin matrices .",
    "the notation @xmath31 means that the sites @xmath12 and @xmath15 are nearest neighbors .",
    "the quantum expectation value @xmath32 of the @xmath33 operators are associated with charge - currents ( @xmath34 ) and spin - currents ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "non - vanishing charge currents lead to appearance of electromagnetic fields , which break the time - reversal symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "experimentally , this does not occur in the cuprates . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the ansatz that there is no charge current in the ground state @xmath36 but circulating spin - currents may arise and take the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 for all @xmath12 and @xmath15 , and @xmath39 is a unit vector .",
    "these spin - currents provide a transition state to the spin - flux mean - field that we use in this paper .    using the pauli spin - matrix identity , @xmath40 , it is possible to rewrite the nearest - neighbor electron - electron interaction terms as @xmath41 .",
    "if we neglect fluctuations in the spin - currents , we can use the mean - field factorization , @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the quartic nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction term is reduced to a quadratic term that is added to the hopping term leading to the effective hamiltonian : @xmath43 here , @xmath44 are spin - dependent @xmath45 hopping matrix elements defined by the mean - field theory , and @xmath46 . in deriving ( [ 1.104 ] ) we have dropped constant terms which simply change the zero of energy as well as terms proportional to @xmath47 which simply change the chemical potential .",
    "it was shown previously @xcite that the ground state energy of the hamiltonian of eq.([1.104 ] ) depends on the su(2 ) matrices @xmath48 only through the plaquette matrix product @xmath49 . here",
    ", @xmath50 is the spin - flux which passes through each plaquette and @xmath51 is the angle through which the internal coordinate system of the electron rotates as it encircles the plaquette .",
    "since the electron spinor wavefunction is two - valued , there are only two possible choices for @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath52 we can set @xmath53 and the hamiltonian ( [ 1.104 ] ) describes conventional ordered magnetic states of the hubbard model .",
    "the other possibility is that a spin - flux @xmath54 penetrates each plaquette , leading to @xmath55 .",
    "this means that the one - electron wavefunctions are antisymmetric around each of the plaquettes , i.e. that as an electron encircles a plaquette , its wavefunction in the internal spin space of euler angles rotates by @xmath56 in response to strong interactions with the other electrons . in effect",
    ", the electron performs an internal `` somersault '' as it traverses a closed path in the cuo@xmath9 plane .",
    "this spin - flux phase is accompanied by a afm local moment background ( with reduced magnitude relative to the afm phase of the conventional hubbard model ) . in the spin - flux phase , the kinetic energy term in ( [ 1.104 ] )",
    "exhibits broken symmetry as though a spin - orbit interaction has been added .",
    "however , it is distinct from the smaller , conventional spin - orbit effects which give rise to anisotropic corrections to superexchange interactions between localized spins in the afm .",
    "@xcite in the presence of charge carriers this mean - field is unstable to the proliferation of topological fluctuations ( magnetic solitons ) which eventually destroy afm long range order . in this sense",
    ", the analysis which we present below goes beyond simple mean field theory .",
    "the quantum dynamics of these magnetic solitons described by the configuration interaction ( ci ) method , corresponds to tunneling effects not contained in the hartree - fock approximation . for simplicity , throughout this paper we assume that the mean - field spin - flux parameters @xmath48 are given by the simplest possible choice @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1.55 ] ) . in order to go beyond a mean - field description of the spin - flux , these matrices",
    "may also be treated as dynamical variables . in this paper",
    ", we go beyond mean - field theory in describing the antiferromagnetic degrees of freedom but restrict ourselves to a mean - field model of the spin - flux .",
    "the configuration interaction method utilizes a linear combination of judiciously chosen hartree - fock wavefunctions.@xcite in this section , we provide a short review of the relevant hartree - fock results for the spin - flux model .",
    "a full comparison between the hfa for the spin - flux model and the conventional hubbard model has been published elsewhere .",
    "@xcite      one of the most widely used approximations for the many - electron problem is the static hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) . in this approximation",
    "the many - body problem is reduced to one - electron problems in which each electron moves in a self - consistent manner depending on the mean - field potential of the other electrons in the system . while this method is insufficient , by itself , to capture all of the physics of low dimensional electronic systems with strong correlations , it provides a valuable starting point from which essential fluctuation corrections can be included . in particular",
    ", we use the hartree - fock method to establish the electronic structure and the static energies of various magnetic soliton structures . in the more general configuration interaction ( ci )",
    "variational wavefunction , the solitons acquire quantum dynamics and describe large amplitude tunneling and fluctuation effects that go beyond mean field theory .    in the hf approximation ,",
    "the many - body wavefunction @xmath58 is decomposed into a slater determinant of effective one - electron orbitals .",
    "the one - electron orbitals are found from the condition that the total energy of the system is minimized @xmath59    in order to approximate the ground state of the spin - flux hamiltonian ( [ 1.104 ] ) , we consider a slater determinant trial - wavefunction of the form @xmath60 is the vacuum state , @xmath61 is the total number of electrons in the system and the one - electron states are given by @xmath62 here , the one - particle wave - functions @xmath63 form a complete and orthonormal system .    using the wavefunction ( [ 2.3 ] ) in equation (",
    "[ 2.1 ] ) , and minimizing with respect to the one - particle wavefunctions @xmath63 , we obtain the hartree - fock eigen - equations : where @xmath64 are the pauli spin matrices and the charge density , @xmath65 and the spin density , @xmath66 must be computed self - consistently . the notation @xmath67 appearing in ( [ 2.5 ] ) means that the sum is performed over the sites @xmath15 which are nearest - neighbors of the site @xmath12 .",
    "the self - consistent hartree - fock equations ( [ 2.5],[2.6],[2.7 ] ) must be satisfied by the occupied orbitals @xmath68 , but can also be used to compute the empty ( hole ) orbitals .",
    "the ground - state energy of the system in the hfa is given by @xmath69 where the single particle energies are obtained from ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "the approximation scheme described above is called the unrestricted hartree - fock approximation , because we did not impose constraints on the wavefunction @xmath58 which would require it to be an eigenfunction of various symmetry operations which commute with the hamiltonian ( [ 1.104 ] ) . if these symmetries are enforced , the method is called the restricted hartree - fock approximation .",
    "we use the unrestricted hfa since it leads to lower energies .",
    "the breaking of symmetries in our case implies that electronic correlations are more effectively taken into account .",
    "@xcite the restoration of these symmetries is deferred until the ci wavefunction is introduced .    in the undoped ( half - filled ) case",
    ", the self - consistent hartree - fock equations can be solved analytically for the infinite system , using plane - wave one - particle wave - functions . in the unrestricted hartree - fock approach ,",
    "doping the system leads to the appearance of inhomogeneous solutions , which break the translational invariance . in this case",
    ", we solve the unrestricted self - consistent hartree - fock equations numerically on a finite lattice . starting with an initial spin and charge distribution @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ", we numerically solve the eigenproblem ( [ 2.5 ] ) and find the hf eigenenergies @xmath72 and wavefunctions @xmath73 .",
    "these are used in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) to calculate the new spin and charge distribution , and the procedure is repeated until self - consistency is reached .",
    "numerically , we define self - consistency by the condition that the largest variation of any of the charge or spin components on any of the sites of the lattice is less that @xmath74 between successive iterations .      for the undoped system , the hartree - fock equations ( [ 2.5 ] ) for an infinite system are easily solved . in the cuprates , long - range afm order is experimentally observed .",
    "accordingly , we choose a spin distribution at the site @xmath75 of the form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the unit vector of some arbitrary direction , while the charge distribution is @xmath78 . in the spin - flux phase , it is convenient to choose a square unit cell , in order to simplify the description of the @xmath48 phase - factors .",
    "we make the simplest gauge choice compatible with the spin - flux condition for the @xmath79-matrices , namely that @xmath80 ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig1.55 ] ) ) .",
    "this leads to the reduced square brillouin zone @xmath81 . from the hartree - fock equations we find two electronic bands , characterized by the dispersion relations : @xmath82 where each level is four - fold degenerate and @xmath83 are the noninteracting electron dispersion relations in the presence of spin - flux .",
    "the hf ground - state energy of the spin - flux afm background is given by ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) ) : @xmath84 where the afm local moment amplitude is determined by the self - consistency condition ( [ 2.7 ] ) @xmath85    at half - filling the valence band ( @xmath86 ) is completely filled , the conduction band ( @xmath87 ) is completely empty , and a mott - hubbard gap of magnitude @xmath88 opens between the valence and the conduction bands .",
    "the ground - state of the undoped spin - flux model is an afm mott insulator .",
    "it is interesting to note that the quasi - particle dispersion relation obtained in the presence of the spin - flux ( eq .",
    "( [ 2.27 ] ) ) closely resembles the dispersion as measured through angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) in a compound such as sr@xmath9cuo@xmath9cl@xmath9 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2.13 ] ) .",
    "there is a a large peak centered at @xmath89 with an isotropic dispersion relation around it , observed on both the @xmath90 to @xmath91 and @xmath92 to @xmath93 lines .",
    "the spin - flux model in hfa exhibits another smaller peak at @xmath94 which is not resolvable in existing experimental data .",
    "this minor discrepancy may be due to next nearest neighbor hopping or other aspects of the electron - electron interaction which we have not yet been included in our model .",
    "@xcite the quasi - particle dispersion relation of the conventional hubbard model ( @xmath95 ) has a large peak at @xmath96 on the @xmath90 to @xmath91 line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2.13 ] ) , but it is perfectly flat on the @xmath92 to @xmath93 line ( which is part of the large nested fermi surface of the conventional 2d hubbard model ) . also , it has a large crossing from the upper to the lower band - edge on the @xmath90 to @xmath92 line .",
    "this dispersion relation is very similar to that of the @xmath97 model ( see ref .",
    "17 ) .    while both the conventional and spin - flux model predict afm insulators at half - filling ( at least at the hf level ) , the spin - flux also provides a much better agreement with the dispersion relations , as measured by arpes .",
    "as in the 1d case , @xcite the effect of doping is the appearance of discrete levels deep inside the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "these levels are drawn into the gap from the top ( bottom ) of the undoped valence ( conduction ) bands .",
    "accordingly , the type of excitations created by doping depends strongly on topology of the electronic structure near the band edges .",
    "if we introduce just one hole in the plane , the self - consistent hfa solution is a conventional spin - polaron or `` spin - bag '' ( see fig .",
    "this type of excitation is the 2d analog of the 1d spin - polaron .",
    "@xcite the doping hole is localized around a particular site , leading to the appearance of a small ferromagnetic core around that site .",
    "the spin and charge distribution at the other sites are only slightly affected .",
    "in fact , the localization length of the charge depends on @xmath7 , and becomes very large as @xmath98 , since in this limit the mott - hubbard gap closes . for intermediate and large @xmath7 ,",
    "the doping hole is almost completely localized on the five sites of the ferromagnetic core .",
    "the spin - bag is a charged fermion , as can be seen by direct inspection of its charge and spin distributions .",
    "this is also confirmed by its electronic structure ( see fig.3b ) .",
    "thus , the 2d spin - bag is indeed the analog of the 1d spin - polaron .",
    "@xcite      the 2d analog of the 1d charged domain wall is the meron - vortex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2.22 ] ) . like the 1d domain - wall ,",
    "the meron - vortex is also a topological excitation , characterized by a topological ( winding ) number @xmath99 ( the spins on each sublattice rotate by @xmath100 on any closed contour surrounding the center of the meron ) . as such , a single meron - vortex can not be created in an extended afm background with cyclic boundary conditions by the introduction of a single hole ( just as a single isolated charged domain wall can not be created on an afm ( even ) chain with cyclic boundary conditions , by the introduction of a single hole ) . from a topological point of view",
    ", this is so because the afm background has a winding number 0 , and the winding number must be conserved , unless topological excitations migrate over the boundary into the considered region .",
    "however , excitations can be created in pairs of total topological number 0 . in the 1d case , this means creation of pairs of domain walls , while in 2d this means the creation of vortex - antivortex pairs .    from figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) we can see that the meron - vortex is a charged boson .",
    "the total spin of such a configuration is zero , while it carries the doping charge trapped in the vortex core .",
    "moreover , from its electronic spectrum ( fig .",
    "4b ) we can see that only the extended states of the valence band are occupied .",
    "they are the only ones contributing to the total spin .",
    "since only one state is drawn from the valence band into the gap , to become a discrete bound level , it appears that an odd ( unpaired ) number of states remains in the valence band .",
    "however , one must remember that for topological reasons , merons must appear in vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "therefore , the valence band has an even number of ( paired ) levels , and the total spin is zero . this argument for",
    "the bosonic character of the meron - vortex is identical to that for the charged domain wall in polyacetylene .",
    "@xcite    unlike in the 1d case,@xcite we can not directly compare the excitation energy of the spin - bag with the excitation energy of the meron - vortex .",
    "the reason is that the excitation energy of the latter increases logarithmically with the size of the sample , and therefore an isolated meron - vortex is always energetically more expensive than a spin - bag .",
    "however , topology requires that merons and antimerons are created in pairs .",
    "the excitation energy of such a meron - antimeron pair is finite , allowing a meaningful comparison between excitation energies of a pair of spin - bags and a meron - antimeron pair .      in figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) we show the self - consistent spin and charge distributions for the lowest energy self - consistent hf configuration found when we add 2 holes to the afm background , in the spin - flux model , for @xmath101 .",
    "this configuration consists of a meron and an antimeron centered on second nearest - neighbor sites . as a result of interactions ,",
    "the cores of the vortices are somewhat distorted .",
    "if the vortices were uncharged , vortex - antivortex pair annihilation would be possible .",
    "however , for charged vortices , the fermionic nature of the underlying electrons prevents two holes from being localized at the same site , in spite of the bosonic character of the collective excitation .",
    "a very interesting feature of this configuration is the strong topological attraction between the vortex and the antivortex .",
    "the closer the two cores are to each other , the smaller is the region in which the spins are rotated out of their background afm orientation by the vortices , and therefore the smaller is the excitation energy of the pair .",
    "since the holes are localized in the cores of the vortices , this topological attraction between vortices is an effective attraction between holes in the purely repulsive 2d electron system .",
    "this effect is unique to the spin - flux phase . in the conventional hubbard model ,",
    "vortices are not stable excitations .",
    "the vortex - antivortex attraction increases as the logarithm of the distance between the cores .",
    "therefore , the pair of vortices should remain bound even if full unscreened @xmath102 coulomb repulsion exists between the charged cores , providing a compelling scenario for the existence of strongly bound pre - formed pairs in the underdoped regime .",
    "there is another possible self - consistent state for the system with two holes , consisting of two spin - bags far from each other ( such that their localized wave functions do not overlap ) .",
    "the excitation energy of such a pair of spin - bags is simply twice the excitation energy of a single spin - bag .",
    "when this excitation energy is compared to the excitation energy of the tightly bound meron - antimeron pair , we find that it is higher by @xmath103 ( for @xmath101 ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath104 the hfa predicts that the meron - antimeron pair is the low - energy charged excitation , while for @xmath105 , the spin - bag is the low - energy charge carrier .",
    "this is analogous with the situation in 1d , where the spin - bag was predicted to be the low energy excitation for @xmath106 , in the hfa . @xcite as in 1d , however , we expect that this conclusion will be drastically modified once the charged solitons are allowed to move along the planes and the lowering of kinetic energy through translations is also taken into consideration .",
    "we complete this review of the hf results by pointing out that the strong analogy between the 1d hubbard model and the 2d spin - flux model is due to the similarity between the electronic structures at zero doping . as seen from fig.[fig2.13 ]",
    ", the 2d spin - flux model has isotropic dispersion relations about the @xmath96 point .",
    "this acts as a fermi point for the noninteracting system as it does in the 1d system .",
    "the two empty discrete levels drawn deep inside the mott - hubbard gap in the presence of the meron - vortex split from the @xmath96 peaks of the electron dispersion relation .",
    "the different topology of the large nested fermi surface of the conventional hubbard model leads to instability of the meron - antimeron pair .",
    "in fact , in the conventional hubbard model doping holes assemble in charged stripes , as opposed to the liquid of meron - antimeron pairs which is the low - energy state of the doped spin - flux model .",

    "the extra kinetic energy @xmath164 saved by the spin - bag through quantum hopping is @xmath165 in the conventional model and @xmath166 in the spin - flux model ( for @xmath101 ) . since the spin - bag is confined to one magnetic sublattice , it must tunnel two lattice constants to the next allowed site .",
    "consequently , the energy gained through hopping ( of order @xmath167 ) is small .",
    "this is displayed , for the spin - bag of the spin - flux model , in fig .",
    "[ fig3.24 ] , where we plot the lowering in kinetic energy of the deconfined spin - bag @xmath168 as a function of @xmath169 .",
    "a similar dependence for the spin - bag of the conventional hubbard model is presented elsewhere .",
    "@xcite as in the 1d case , we conclude that the spin - bag in 2d is a rather immobile quasiparticle - like excitation .    in the 1d model",
    "it is energetically favorable for the immobile spin - bag to decay into a charged bosonic domain wall and a neutral fermionic domain wall , resulting in spin - charge separation .",
    "@xcite the analog of the 1d charged bosonic domain wall is the 2d charged bosonic meron - vortex of the spin - flux model .",
    "if the spin - bag decays into a charged meron - vortex , a magnetic antivortex must also be created for topological reasons . unlike the pair of domain walls in the 1d case , the vortex - antivortex pair is tightly bound by a topological binding potential that increases as the logarithm of the vortex - antivortex separation .",
    "therefore , we expect that the doping charge is shared between the two magnetic vortices .",
    "one technical problem for testing this hypothesis is that such a configuration ( a vortex - antivortex pair sharing one doping hole ) is not self - consistent at the static hartree - fock level . in the static approximation",
    "we require two doping holes to stabilize two vortex cores and create a meron - antimeron pair .",
    "we can , however , construct a trial wavefunction to describe the singly - charged vortex - antivortex pair , by adding one electron in the first empty state of the self - consistent doubly - charged meron - antimeron configuration .",
    "the first empty levels of the meron - antimeron pair are the localized levels bound in the vortex cores , two for each vortex ( see fig .",
    "because of degeneracy between the two lower discrete levels of the pair , we have in fact two distinct trial wave - functions , obtained by adding one electron in either of these two lower localized gap electronic states of a self - consistent meron - antimeron pair . these wavefunctions are not invariant to rotations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2.25 ] ) .",
    "therefore we must include in the ci set of slater determinants the configurations obtained through @xmath170 rotations of the vortex - antivortex pair about its fixed center of mass in addition to translated configurations . as a result",

    "the energy of the static singly - charged vortex - antivortex pair is @xmath175 .",
    "thus , we see that because this singly - charged pair trial wavefunction is not self - consistent , in the static case this configuration is energetically much more costly than the self - consistent spin - bag configuration .",
    "however , if we allow for quantum motion of these configurations , the situation changes dramatically . performing the ci analysis for the set of all possible translated spin - bag configurations , we find that the energy of the spin - bag is lowered to @xmath176 . performing the ci analysis for the set of",
    "all translated and rotated singly - charged vortex - antivortex pairs we find that this configuration s energy is lowered to @xmath177 .",
    "this shows that the vortex - antivortex pair has lowered its translational and rotational kinetic energy by almost @xmath178 , thereby becoming the low - energy charge carrier .",
    "this large number is not surprising , since unlike the spin - bag , the vortex - antivortex pair is not constrained to motion on one magnetic sublattice . as a result ,",
    "such configurations lower their kinetic energy by an amount on the scale of @xmath24 , as opposed to @xmath167 for the spin - bag configuration . for larger @xmath7 values",
    "this effect is even more pronounced .",
    "we conclude that these results strongly support the hypothesis of spin - bag dissociation into a much more mobile singly - charged vortex - antivortex pair , analogous to the 1d spin - bag dissociation into a pair of a charged bosonic domain - wall and a neutral fermionic domain - wall .",
    "@xcite unlike in the 1d case , however , we do not have distinct charge and spin carriers for the composite excitation .",
    "instead the spin and the charge are shared equally between the vortex and the antivortex .",
    "if , on the other hand , there was a mechanism whereby the vortices became unbound , complete spin - charge separation could occur , in which one vortex traps the hole ( and is therefore a charged meron ) and the other vortex carries the spin , in a lotus - flower@xcite ( or undoped magnetic meron ) configurations . in the absence of the corresponding self - consistent static hf configuration we are not able to settle this question . at very low doping ,",
    "the strong vortex - antivortex topological attraction binds the spin and charge together .",
    "this is different from the 1d case , where the absence of long - range interactions between the domain - walls allow for a complete spin - charge separation at any doping and even at zero temperature .",
    "this scenario opens a new avenue for research into how the system evolves with doping .",
    "if each hole is dressed into a singly - charged vortex - antivortex pair , when two such pairs overlap it is possible that both doping charges move to the same pair , creating a meron - antimeron pair of charged bosons .",
    "such pre - formed charge pairs may condense into a superconducting state at low temperatures .",
    "the other uncharged vortex - antivortex pair may either collapse and disappear ( this is likely to happen at low - temperatures ) or remain as a magnetic excitation of the system ( at higher temperatures ) , mediating the destruction of the long - range afm order , the renormalization of the spin - wave spectrum and the opening of the spin pseudogap .      from the static hf analysis we found that the most stable static self - consistent configuration with two doping holes added to the afm background of the spin - flux model is the meron - antimeron pair , for @xmath179 .",
    "at larger @xmath7 , two charged spin - bags become more stable , in the static hf approximation .",
    "this is in close analogy to the prediction that the spin - bag is energetically more favorable than the static charged domain - wall for @xmath180 , in the hfa of the 1d hubbard model .",
    "@xcite however , in the 1d case the charged domain - wall is considerably more mobile than the charged spin bag , gaining a kinetic energy of the order of @xmath24 as opposed to @xmath167 energy gained by the spin - bag . as a result ,",
    "when this kinetic energy of deconfinement is taken into account within the ci method , the charged domain - wall is found to be the relevant charged excitation for all values of @xmath7 .",
    "a similar picture emerges in the 2d case , because the meron - vortices are much more mobile than the spin - bags .    for the 2d system",
    ", we have shown that the charged spin - bag has very similar behavior to the 1d charged spin - bag .",
    "the analog of the 1d charged bosonic domain - wall is the 2d charged bosonic meron - vortex .",
    "we now consider the properties of the doubly - charged meron - antimeron pair .",
    "all the numerical results quoted in the rest of this section refer to a meron - antimeron pair on a 10x10 lattice , in the spin - flux model with @xmath101 .",
    "as already discussed , the meron - antimeron pair is not rotationally invariant .",
    "we can find the rotational kinetic energy saved by the pair as it rotates about its center of mass .",
    "in the present case , only 4 configurations need to be included , corresponding to the four possible self - consistent arrangements of the meron and antimeron about their fixed center of mass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3.28 ] ) . simple rotation by @xmath170 of the one - particle orbitals @xmath181 about the center of mass is not , however , sufficient to generate the rotated configurations .",
    "first of all , the @xmath170 rotation also changes the spin - flux parameterization .",
    "if the spin - flux of the initial configuration is @xmath57 , a @xmath170 rotation leads to a state corresponding to the rotated configuration @xmath182 .",
    "thus , following the @xmath170 rotation , a unitary transformation must be performed in order to restore the initial spin - flux parameterization . for the case",
    "cited above , this simply implies the change in the one - particle orbitals @xmath183 for all sites @xmath184 which are a type 2 site of the unit cell , in other words sites with even @xmath185 and odd @xmath186 ( also , see fig .",
    "[ fig1.55 ] ) .",
    "the second observation is that the rotation by @xmath170 also changes ( flips ) all the spins of the afm background surrounding the pair .",
    "thus , an extra @xmath187 rotation about an axis perpendicular to the lattice plane is necessary to restore the alignment of the afm background . following these transformations it is straightforward to generate the slater determinants @xmath188 and @xmath189 from the initial self - consistent hf meron - antimeron pair described by @xmath190 .",
    "the ci method can be used to find the rotational energy saved by superposing these rotated meron - antimeron configurations .",
    "the lowest ci energy found is @xmath191 below the energy of the static pair , and corresponds to d - wave symmetry . by this",
    "we mean that the coefficients @xmath109 multiplying the 4 rotated states in the ci wave - function @xmath192 .",
    "translation of a pair over the whole lattice can also be investigated .",
    "since the pair does not carry any spin , all possible translations must be included ( there is no restriction to same magnetic sublattice configurations ) .",
    "this leads to a total of @xmath193 possible configurations for a @xmath140 lattice . again ,",
    "when various configurations are generated from the initial self - consistent hf meron - antimeron state @xmath194 , care must be taken to preserve the same spin - flux parameterization and the same afm background orientation .",
    "this can be achieved performing transformations similar to the ones described above . as a result of performing the ci method on the set of translated states",

    "quantum hopping of the meron - antimeron pair lowers its total energy by an extra @xmath195 .",
    "two other interesting features are observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3.25 ] .",
    "the first one is that the dispersion relation of this rigidly polarized pair is not invariant to rotations by @xmath170 , as expected .",
    "more important is that the minima of the dispersion relation occur at the @xmath91 points .",
    "since the momentum of the pair is twice the momentum of either the meron or the antimeron , this is consistent with the fact that in their lowest energy state , both the meron and the antimeron have momenta of @xmath89 , in the spin - flux model .",
    "the doubling of the size of the brillouin zone is also a direct consequence of this doubling of total momentum ( for comparison with undoped dispersion relation , see fig .",
    "[ fig2.13 ] ) .",
    "however , to obtain the true energy of the charged pair , we must mix all @xmath196 rotated and translated meron - antimeron configurations .",
    "all have the same static hf energy and are equally important in the ci method .",
    "let @xmath197 denote the initial self - consistent static hartree - fock meron - antimeron configuration , and @xmath198 denote the configuration obtained through translation by @xmath151 sites in the x - direction and @xmath152 sites in the y - direction , as well as a rotation by an angle of @xmath199 of the pair about its center of mass . here",
    "@xmath200 and @xmath201 ( cyclic boundary conditions are imposed ) .",
    "the ci wavefunctions are then given by : @xmath202    the dispersion relation @xmath203 obtained from this complete set is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3.26 ] .",
    "the reference point is the hf energy of the self - consistent meron - antimeron pair @xmath204 .",
    "thus , we see that the total kinetic energy saved by the freely moving and rotating meron - antimeron pair is @xmath205 , when the total momentum of the pair is @xmath91 . this energy equals the sum @xmath206 of rotational and translational kinetic energies found before ( the number of significant figures indicates the estimated accuracy of the computational method ) .",
    "the rotational invariance of the dispersion band is also restored .",
    "besides the absolute minima about the @xmath91 points , there is a more shallow minimum region about the @xmath90 point .",
    "the rotational symmetry of the meron - antimeron pair wavefunction , defined by the coefficients @xmath207 , is a function of the total momentum carried by the pair , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3.27 ] .",

    "the coefficients @xmath212 again satisfy eq .",

    "a simple decomposition of the form ( [ 3.101 ] ) is no longer possible . instead , a sum of such terms corresponding to different @xmath215 values is required .",
    "since we only have rotations by @xmath170 , a unique identification of the composite symmetry is not possible .",
    "moreover , the energy of the states in this intermediary area is at the top of the dispersion band . in order to find the correct ci states for energies well above the static hf value ( i.e. larger than zero , in this case ) we must add to the ci set the first set of excited hf states . for a meron - antimeron pair , excitation of an electron from the valence band onto the empty localized levels",
    "inside the mott - hubbard gap costs about 1.5 t of energy , for @xmath101 , so such states should contribute significantly in the ci states with positive energies and modify their dispersion and symmetry ( for this reason , we do not show the upper three high - energy bands in fig .",

    "their energies and rotational symmetry are unaffected by additions of higher energy configurations to the ci set .",

    "@xcite we are not aware of any other microscopic theory that predicts the two types of pairing to appear in different regions of the brillouin zone .",
    "the total kinetic energy saved by the meron - antimeron pair through quantum hopping and rotation is of order @xmath24 , as expected , since the pair is not restricted to one magnetic sublattice and tunneling is not required for motion .",
    "consequently , we expect that the energy saved by the meron - antimeron pair for larger values of @xmath7 is comparably large .",
    "on the other hand , the energy saved by the spin bag through tunneling motion scales like @xmath167 .",
    "in fact , we argued that a spin - bag may dissociate into a singly - charged vortex - antivortex pair in order to enhance its mobility .",
    "however , even if dissociation does not occur , the kinetic energy saved by a pair of spin - bags is significantly smaller than the kinetic energy saved by the meron - antimeron pair .",
    "this shows that for @xmath101 the meron - antimeron pair is even more favorable energetically than the hfa predicts and suggests that the @xmath7 range where meron - antimeron pair formation occurs may extend well beyond the @xmath221 limit found within the hfa .",
    "@xcite in the 1d case , the range of stability of the charged domain wall versus the charged spin - bag is extended ( from the hf prediction of @xmath222 ) to all @xmath7 range.@xcite a numerical analysis is needed to determine if the limit is extended to infinity in the 2d case as well .",
    "the configuration interaction approximation incorporates crucial quantum translational and rotational motion of the charge carriers , which are absent in the static hartree - fock approximation .",
    "given the accuracy of the ci method in recapturing certain features of the exact bethe ansatz solution of the 1d hubbard model , @xcite we believe that the ci method is likewise a very powerful tool for describing effects beyond mean - field theory in 2d .",

    "@xcite there are also strong indications that a charged spin - bag is unstable to decay into a singly - charged vortex - antivortex pair , analogous to the spin - charge separation in the 1d case .",
    "nucleation of such pairs of vortices with doping is expected to further influence the magnetic behavior of the cuprates .",
    "the bound state and the unbound continuum states of the singly charged meron - antimeron pair may account for the anomalous `` quasiparticle '' spectral widths observed on angle - resolved photo - emission experiments .",
    "the symmetry of the meron - antimeron pairs emerges very clearly from the ci treatment .",
    "we find two regions of stability of the meron - antimeron pair .",
    "pairs with total momentum of @xmath91 have d - wave symmetry , and are the most stable .",
    "pairs with total momentum @xmath90 have s - wave symmetry and have a smaller gap .",
    "thus , we find that different pairing appears in different regions of the brillouin zone .",
    "these results appear to have a direct bearing on numerous experiments , which show a mixture of strong d - wave component and a smaller s - wave component in the superconducting state of the cuprates .",
    "@xcite    many other features of our model are in agreement with experimentally observed properties of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "nucleation of magnetic vortices with doping explains a variety of magnetic properties , starting with complete destruction of the long - range afm order for very low doping concentration . as we can see from fig .",
    "5(a ) a tightly - bound meron - antimeron pairs disturbs the long - range afm ordering of most of the spins on the 10x10 lattice .",
    "for very low dopings , these pairs are far from each other , and there are many spins on the plane whose orientations are not affected by any pair .",
    "thus , most of the spins maintain the long range afm order . however , as the doping increases to about @xmath223 ( which is roughly equivalent to having two meron - antimeron pairs on the 10x10 lattice ) the areas occupied by each meron - antimeron pairs start to overlap with those occupied by the neighboring pairs . at",
    "this doping the orientation of all the spins on the cuo@xmath9 planes is affected by at least one pair of vortices , and therefore the lro is severely disrupted .",
    "the local ordering , however , is still afm .",
    "this picture explains the extremely low doping necessary for the disappearance of lr afm order , as well as the fact that the spin correlation length is basically equal to the average distance between holes ( vortices ) and does not depend strongly on the temperature.@xcite each hole carries its vortex with it , and the spins in each vortex are correlated with each other .",
    "the correlation length is thus roughly equal to the average size of the vortex which is defined by the average inter - vortex ( inter - hole ) distance .",
    "the nucleation of magnetic vortices also explains the split of the @xmath91 afm bragg peak into the four incommensurate peaks whose positions shift with doping,@xcite as observed in lacuo and , more recently , in ybacuo.@xcite the form factor of any given vortex already gives rise to an apparent splitting of the neutron scattering peak . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "9 , even at the mean - field level we recapture the neutron scattering data using a random distribution of meron - vortices",
    ".    optical behavior of the cuprates is also explained naturally using our model .",
    "two features develop in the optical absorption spectra with doping : a broad mid - infrared temperature - independent absorption band , and a strongly temperature - dependent low - frequency drude tail . @xcite in our model the broad mid - infrared band is related to excitation of electrons from the valence band onto the empty levels bound in the vortex cores , @xcite which are localized deep inside the mott - hubbard gap ( see fig .",
    "the number of localized levels scales with the number of vortices , and inter - vortex interactions lead to their splitting into a broad band . as such",
    ", this mechanism is similar to the one leading to a broad mid - infrared absorption band in polyacetylene with doping .",
    "@xcite the polyacetylene band is due to electronic excitations inside the cores of the polyacetylene domain - wall solitons,@xcite which are the topological analogues of meron - vortices.@xcite another strong argument in favor of this interpretation is provided by photoinduced absorption experiments . @xcite",
    "if the undoped parent compounds are illuminated with intense visible light , they develop absorption bands that resemble the mid - infrared bands of the doped compounds .",
    "similar behavior is observed in polyacetylene , and is attributed to the nucleation of solitons by photoexcited electron - hole pairs . @xcite the second component of the optical spectrum is the drude tail .",
    "it results from the response of the freely moving charged vortices to the external electric field .",
    "the strong temperature dependence of this tail is determined by the scattering mechanism for merons ( presumably due to interactions with other merons and spin - waves ) .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the fact that the superconducting transition leaves the mid - infrared absorption band unchanged .",
    "merons with internal electronic structure are still present on the planes but pair condensation leads to a collapse of the drude tail into a @xmath224 response .",
    "as already discussed , nucleation of charged meron - vortices with doping provides a microscopic basis for non - fermi - liquid behavior , due to the bosonic nature of the mobile charged excitations .",
    "the model also predicts the existence of pre - formed pairs with d - wave symmetry , which are thought to be responsible for the pseudo - gap effects .",
    "@xcite as the number of pairs of charged bosons increases with doping and the temperature is lowered , the meron - antimeron pairs bose condense and become coherent , leading to superconductivity .",
    "this mechanism naturally explains the puzzling scaling of the superfluid density with doping @xmath225 , in other words with the number of holes , not of electrons . in our model , it is the doping - induced positively charged meron - vortices that are the mobile charge carriers . as a result ,",
    "the density of preformed meron - antimeron cooper pairs is obviously proportional to doping . finally , for large dopings ( @xmath226 ) the average vortex size become extremely small and the very cores of the merons start to overlap . in this limit the mott - hubbard gap is completely filled in by the discrete levels , and the spin - flux state becomes energetically unstable relative to a normal fermi liquid .",
    "@xcite    it is noteworthy that all of the independent features described above are in qualitative agreement with our model , which has essentially no free or adjustable parameters .",
    "the choice of @xmath7 is fixed by the experimentally measured size of the mott - hubbard charge transfer gap at zero doping .",
    "more detailed comparisons with specific experiments may require the incorporation of specific ( smaller energy scale ) interactions which are not included in this simplest version of the spin - flux hamiltonian .",
    "a derivation of the explicit consequences of this picture appears to be worthy .",
    "a more comprehensive and quantitative e comparison with the experiments may prove quite fruitful .",
