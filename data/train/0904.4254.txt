    "* e.g. ) have schemed up a global picture of the reionization process , many detailed issues remain uncertain @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising probes of the cosmic reionization is the redshifted 21 cm transition of hi ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the emission or absorption of the 21 cm radiation is directly related to the neutral component of the igm at different redshifts , thus affording us the most clear view of the reionization history . moreover , unlike the ly@xmath0 resonance line which also traces the neutral hydrogen , the 21 cm line has an extremely small einstein coefficient ( @xmath1 ) , hence it is not saturated even at high redshift , and one can therefore safely predict the neutral fraction from its 21 cm optical depth .",
    "the most commonly discussed way of 21 cm observation is _ 21 cm tomography _ , in which the three dimensional structure of the emission or absorption of 21 cm photons by the igm against the cmb is observed @xcite .",
    "a less frequently discussed way of 21 cm observation is to observe the spectra of high redshift radio point sources , such as quasars or gamma ray burst ( grb ) radio afterglows , and look for absorption or leak features produced by structures along the line of sight .",
    "21 cm forest _ could be produced by structures of different scales , including the large scale hi / hii regions ( `` bubbles '' ) , the cosmic web , proto - galaxies or mini - halos .",
    "the optical depth of the 21 cm line due to the absorption by the igm at redshift @xmath2 is @xcite : @xmath3,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the neutral fraction of hydrogen at a specific position , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the number density of hydrogen and the spin temperature of the igm at that position , respectively , and @xmath7 is the gradient of the proper velocity along the line of sight , including both the hubble expansion and the peculiar velocity .",
    "as we are going to study the large scale hi / hii regions , the peculiar velocity is neglected . in the second line , the factor @xmath8 is the overdensity of the baryons , and @xmath6 is in units of kelvin .    in the following",
    ", we will assume that the spin temperature always follows the gas temperature , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "this is a good approximation for the redshifts relevant here @xcite , where the ly@xmath0  background from star formations @xcite is present , and the hi spin temperature is strongly coupled to the kinetic temperature via the wouthuysen - field effect @xcite .",
    "the 21 cm forest signal is sensitive to the spin temperature , this is a great advantage compared with 21 cm tomographic observation against the cmb background . the latter could also be sensitive to the spin temperature in the case of absorption , but once the spin temperature raises above the cmb temperature , the 21 cm signal become emission , which saturates and become almost independent of @xmath6 .",
    "this uncertainty in spin temperature causes large degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical parameters in 21 cm tomography @xcite .",
    "the information extracted from the 21 cm forest observation may help us to determine the spin temperature at the relevant redshifts , and reduce the degeneracies in 21 cm tomography .",
    "@xcite used numerical simulation to illustrate the 21 cm forest imprinted on quasar spectrum .",
    "@xcite considered small scale features produced by mini - halos and galaxies .",
    "the absorption features produced by the hii regions ( `` ionized bubbles '' ) before reionization was studied @xcite using the analytical `` bubble model '' of reionization @xcite , in which the ionization proceeds inside - out , i.e. from high density regions to low density regions .",
    "the reionization process is very complicated , although the `` bubble model '' picture of reionization is in general agreement with simulation results @xcite , the complicated geometry of the ionized regions is not considered in this simple analytical model .",
    "therefore , to extract information from future 21 cm forest observations , it is imperative to examine how the 21 cm forest observables are correlated with the reionization process by using numerical simulations . in this paper , we study the large scale 21 cm forest produced by the neutral and ionized bubbles using the reionization simulation by @xcite .",
    "the high resolution simulation has detailed modeling of star formation and radiative transfer of ionizing photons .",
    "first , we check whether the equivalent width ( ew ) can be a representative indicator of the ionization and thermal state of the igm , and to what extent the 21 cm forests trace cosmic reionization",
    ". then we use simulation data to predict the observational consequences for 21 cm forest . comparing them with realistic parameters of radio arrays ,",
    "we study what constraints we could put on reionization from 21 cm forest observations .",
    "we briefly describe the reionization simulation in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we check whether or not , and to what extent , the optical depth ( hence the equivalent width ) follows the ionization state @xmath10 , density field @xmath11 , and thermal history @xmath12 of the igm . from these analyses , we would see what information can be extracted from ew statistics .",
    "then we predict the 21 cm forest signals  distributions and evolution of ews  from the reionization simulation in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we investigate whether there are sufficient number of background sources that are luminous enough for such 21 cm forest observations .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section 6 .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the same @xmath13cdm cosmology as @xcite based on the wmap3 results ( see @xcite , and references therein ) : @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper , we use the reionization simulation described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the high - resolution simulation was run using a hybrid code that contains a n - body algorithm for dark matter , prescriptions for baryons and star formation , and a radiative transfer algorithm for ionizing photons .",
    "all components are solved simultaneously in a periodic box with comoving side length of 100 mpc / h .",
    "the n - body calculations included @xmath15 collisionless dark matter particles , each with a mass of @xmath16 .",
    "this provided sufficient resolution to resolve halos down to masses of @xmath17 and account for the majority of photo - ionizing sources . for each particle , the local matter density and velocity dispersion",
    "are calculated in order to model the baryons and star formation .",
    "the baryons are assumed to have the same overdensity field as the dark matter , and the temperature field is set by the velocity dispersion of the particles .",
    "radiative heating and cooling of the gas are not included in the hybrid simulation .",
    "the criterion for star formation was that the particles must have densities @xmath18 and temperatures",
    "@xmath19 k. this cut in the temperature - density phase space effectively restricts star formation to regions within the virial radius of halos that cool efficiently through atomic line transitions .",
    "the simulation distinguishes between the first generation , population iii ( pop iii ) stars and the second generation , population ii ( pop ii ) stars .",
    "the stellar initial mass function is determined by following the metallicity enrichment of the halo and the igm as described in @xcite .",
    "the input spectrum for ionizing radiation is divided in three energy ranges ( ev ) : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , according to the ionization limits for for hi , hei , and heii .",
    "the radiative transfer algorithm for ionizing radiation is based on a photon - advection scheme that is computationally much less expensive than the ray - tracing scheme in @xcite .",
    "these two approaches have been demonstrated to give very similar results for the majority of the reionization epoch @xcite . in the hybrid simulation ,",
    "reionization is completed by @xmath23 . for post - analysis ,",
    "the dark matter , baryons , and radiation are collected on a grid with @xmath24 cells and the data is saved every 10 million years from @xmath25 down to @xmath26 . in this paper , we make use of the gas density , ionization , and temperature fields .",

    "this means , on one hand , with the first generation of low frequency equipments , we may not be able to observe the signals that we are looking for if the igm was really heated up , but on the other hand , we could obtain information on the gas temperature at the epoch of reionization from 21 cm forest observations .",
    "this is important because the igm temperature contains very rich information about early structure formation , including the initial mass function of the first stars , properties of early mini - quasars and related x - ray heating , etc . in this sense ,",
    "the 21 cm forest can be a powerful tool not only to probe the igm in the early universe , but also to give constraints on the properties of early structures .",
    "our prediction of the mean igm optical depth is a little smaller than those by @xcite at higher redshifts but larger than theirs at lower redshifts .",
    "for example , at @xmath92 @xcite found that @xmath93 , and some of the high - density regions reach @xmath94 and above ; by @xmath95 , the mean igm optical depth has dropped to @xmath96 . in our simulation , however , @xmath97 at @xmath98 and it only drops to @xmath99 at @xmath100 .",
    "however , unlike @xcite , we find very few strong absorbers . in our simulation box ,",
    "only about one in two million cells would have @xmath101 at @xmath98 , and no absorbers has @xmath102 at @xmath103 , while @xcite still predicted 50 lines per unit redshift with @xmath102 at @xmath104 and about 4 lines per unit redshift at @xmath100 .",
    "some of these differences may be due to the different values of cosmological parameters adopted in the two simulation .",
    "however , the main difference probably comes from the different box size of the simulations .",
    "@xcite used a simulation with smaller volume but higher spatial resolution @xcite , in which the typical values of the cosmic overdensity @xmath105 .",
    "our simulation has a much larger box volume , which is much more reliable for large scale reionization , but the size of each cell is larger .",
    "this affects the density fluctuation dramatically , and our typical overdensity within each cell is @xmath76 , with a few regions have @xmath106 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : den ] , the density field evolves very little when smoothed within the cells , though at smaller scales there must be some evolution in density contrast .",
    "therefore , the resultant local optical depth is underestimated .    on the other hand ,",
    "the first hii regions start to appear at redshift about 8 in the simulation by @xcite , which is much later than that in our simulation @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xcite found higher optical depth of 21 cm forest than us at high redshift .",
    "further , in @xcite , those absorbers are typically filaments .",
    "they are at first shock - heated to about 100 k , and at @xmath107 ly@xmath0 heating increases the mean spin temperature to above 100 k. in our simulation , the resolution is not high enough to capture the filaments anyway .",
    "the ly@xmath0 heating is also unlikely to heat the gas to so high a temperature , more likely it could only heat up the igm to a temperature below 100 k before reionization @xcite . in the simulation , these heating mechanisms are not incorporated , and the temperature is just from the velocity dispersion of the particles .",
    "therefore we have lower spin temperature and this results in the higher mean igm optical depth at lower redshifts , though we can artificially adjust the gas temperature as a proxy for incorporating the various heating mechanisms .",
    "to observe the absorption or leak features in the spectrum , the spectrum of the point source has to be observed with a certain precision , which depends on the brightness of the quasar .",
    "the minimum detectable flux density of an interferometer is related to the system temperature @xmath108 , the effective aperture area @xmath109 , channel width @xmath110 , integration time @xmath111 , and the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath112 by : @xmath113 for the observation of resolved signals ( i.e. the resolution pixel @xmath110 is narrower than the width of the feature to be observed ) , the lower limit of the flux density of background sources for an observation of absorbers or leakers with @xmath114 ( when the @xmath115 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are all very small ) is : @xmath116 where the ratio @xmath117 is an intrinsic parameter describing the sensitivity of an interferometry array .",
    "the systematic temperature is the sum of the receiver noise and the temperature of the uncleaned foregrounds .",
    "however , the optical depths of the `` absorbers '' and `` leakers '' are small , while the signals are relatively wide(@xmath118 ) , so that observation of unresolved signals ( or just below resolution ) is more promising . in this case , the lower limit of the flux density for an observation of absorbers or leakers with @xmath119 is : @xmath120 the demanded flux density of the background source is much lower compared to the resolved observations , making more high redshift radio sources qualified for such observations .",
    "we now investigate how many such quasars can be observed .",
    "specifically , we calculate the number of quasars with flux density at the observed frequency @xmath121 larger than the lower limit described above . in the following ,",
    "we assume that all the radio quasars are of the same spectral energy distribution with that of the powerful radio galaxy cygnus a , i.e. @xmath122 @xcite . then the limiting flux density converts to a limiting luminosity density at a rest - frame frequency of 151 mhz , @xmath123 .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that at @xmath124 , the comoving number density of radio sources with luminosity density at the frequency 151 mhz , @xmath125 , is @xmath126 .",
    "we extrapolate this number density to higher redshift and lower luminosity . assuming that the comoving number density of qualified quasars at redshift @xmath2 is given by @xmath127 , and according to the best - fitting luminosity function given by @xcite , we have @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a normalization constant , which in general is a function of redshift .",
    "but it is suggested by @xcite that there is very little evidence for an abrupt decline in the comoving space density of the most luminous low - frequency - selected sources at high redshift , and the best - fitting model gives a constant comoving space density .",
    "if , optimistically , we hypothesize quasars evolve according to the flat model , i.e. the number density does not vary with redshift in the comoving coordinate , then the number of qualified quasars ( @xmath130 ) in the whole sky per redshift interval is : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the comoving coordinate corresponding to redshift z. on the other hand , based on optically selected quasars from sdss , @xcite suggest that independent of the adopted radio spectral index , the drop in the space density of optically bright radio loud quasars between @xmath133 and @xmath134 is at most a factor @xmath135 . if we adopt the upmost factor 2 , then @xmath136.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the number of quasars in the whole sky that can be used to detect signals with @xmath137khz per redshift interval .",
    "_ left panel _ : the number of qualified quasars in the flat evolution model . _ right panel _ : the number in the steep evolution model .",
    "the sensitivity of the radio array is taken to be @xmath138 @xmath139 , @xmath140 @xmath139 , and @xmath141 @xmath139 for the _ red - solid _ , _ blue - dashed _ , and _ black dotted _ line , respectively .",
    "the integration time is assumed to be 100 hours here .",
    "]    we plot the number of quasars which satisfy the above criteria for probing signals with @xmath142 khz in fig .",
    "[ fig : qso_evo ] for the flat evolution case in the left panel , and for the evolved case in the right panel . here",
    "we choose three values of sensitivity , @xmath143 @xmath139 , @xmath140 @xmath139 , and @xmath141 @xmath139 respectively , which can be achieved in future observation programs . the square kilometer array ( ska )",
    "will have @xmath143 @xmath139 at the frequency between 70 mhz and 300 mhz ( see http://www.skatelescope.org/ ) , and the low frequency array ( lofar ) could marginally achieve @xmath144 @xmath139 at 200 mhz ( http://www.lofar.org/ ) .",
    "we can see that for the flatly evolved quasar density , there would be many bright quasars which could be used as our background sources .",
    "however , for the steeply evolved quasar model , those suitable background quasars would be very few .",
    "we used a numerical simulation with star formation and radiative transfer @xcite to study the 21 cm forest signals during the epoch of reionization .",
    "we first defined absolute and relative absorbers and leakers on spectra of background sources produced by structures along the line of sight , and checked whether the absorbers or leakers can represent the ionization and thermal state of the igm .",
    "we found that the optical depth can be a reasonable tracer of the ionized fraction of the igm , and the equivalent width could serves as a great probe of cosmic reionization .",
    "the features selected by absolute threshold in optical depth are also very sensitive to the igm temperature , so the temperature information of the igm could be separated from the ionization fraction and density fluctuations with 21 cm forest observation , making it a good complement to 21 cm tomography observation . at the scales we studied",
    ", the density fluctuation plays a minor role in determining the optical depth . also , we see correspondence between the 3-dimensional bubbles and the projected 21 cm forest signals .",
    "the number densities of leakers and absorbers with different equivalent widths evolve with redshift , showing the evolution of ionization status of the igm . while the total number of absorbers decreases significantly with decreasing redshift",
    ", the largest absorbers persist to low redshifts because of the self - shielding effect . as for the leakers , diminished small ones and ballooning large ones with time show the signature of merging ionized bubbles . from the largest width of leakers or absorbers in 21 cm forest spectra",
    ", we may infer the size of ionized bubbles or neutral islands at specific redshifts .    the most important advantage regarding the 21 cm forest observation is its sensitive dependence of signals on the igm temperature .",
    "the number density of potentially observable signals decreases dramatically with the increasing gas temperature , so the temperature of the igm at each redshift could be constrained potentially through the 21 cm forest observations . as the thermal history of the igm carries rich information about the first luminous sources , including the population of the first stars , properties of mini - quasars , and complex heating processes , the 21 cm forest observation is a potentially powerful probe of the early structure formation of the universe .",
    "the measurement of the gas temperature would also help improve the precision of the measurement of cosmological parameters .",
    "we also compared our results with a previous work by @xcite , who used a simulation with higher resolution but smaller volume @xcite .",
    "while our simulation has a much larger volume which is necessary to account for large hii regions at late epochs of reionization , small - scale structures such as small filaments and minihalos are not resolved , especially in the binned data used for post - analysis . with higher resolution simulations , higher gas overdensities and hence higher optical depths",
    "would be expected . since heating processes",
    "are not included in our simulation , the assumed gas temperature is not realistic , but we do consider a range of possible temperatures . with these limitations , we can not make an accurate prediction for the signal , but instead provide a basic expected range .",
    "nonetheless , our simulation does reveal some qualitative features of the large scale 21 cm signal , and propose here that the 21 cm forest observations , especially the ew statistics , could play an important role in extracting temperature information of the igm .",
    "we reserve more realistic investigation of the 21 cm forest to future works , for example by using higher - resolution versions of the hydro+radiative transfer simulations presented in @xcite , which have self - consistent hydrodynamics and temperature evolution .",
    "finally we discussed the the number of luminous high redshift radio sources which is potentially available for observing such forest signals .",
    "we investigated the requirement on the luminosity of background radio sources for the observation of signals with equivalent widths larger than 1khz .",
    "we considered how the number of qualified quasars in the whole sky evolves with redshift according to two models .",
    "if quasars evolves according to the flat evolution model , we would have sufficient quasars as background sources at high redshift ; if quasars evolve fast , however , only those signals at relatively lower redshift can be observed in the near future .",
