    "it is long known that the shear flows are important ingredient of the solar wind dynamics .",
    "@xcite was first who suggested that the solar wind is a turbulently evolving medium .",
    "he noticed that velocity - shear driven instabilities could produce power spectra of magnetic and velocity fluctuations observed in the solar wind .",
    "he also suggested that the dissipation of the turbulence at high wave numbers could account for the anomalously high proton temperature observed in the solar wind at 1 au .",
    "the observations of the fast solar wind fluctuations @xcite show that below the ion - cyclotron frequency spectrum of the fluctuations consist of two intervals . below the spacecraft - frame frequency @xmath1 hz , which is usually referred as energy containing range ,",
    "the spectral slope is close to @xmath0 , while for higher frequencies the kolmogorov spectrum is observed ( this range is called inertial range ) .",
    "it is widely agreed that the formation of the kolmogorov spectrum in the inertial range is related to the active turbulent cascade , as originally proposed by @xcite , whereas the origin of the spectrum observed in the energy containing range is not entirely clear yet [ see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ] .",
    "first explanation was proposed by @xcite .",
    "these authors suggest that the observed spectrum results from the superposition of uncorrelated samples of solar surface turbulence .",
    "alternative possibility suggests that the formation of the spectrum can be related to the coronal dynamics @xcite .    the viewpoint that velocity - shear driven instabilities could produce power spectra of magnetic and velocity fluctuations observed in the solar wind has two major shortcomings .",
    "firstly , @xcite noticed that alfvnic fluctuations in the fast flows of the solar wind are strongly imbalanced - the power of the alfvn waves traveling outward from the sun is significantly larger than the power of inward propagating alfvn waves and it is difficult to explain how the shear - driven instabilities can produce this asymmetry .",
    "secondly , as mentioned by @xcite , the kelvin - helmholtz instability can not produce observed large - scale fluctuations . for these reasons",
    "it is widely accepted nowadays @xcite that the dominant , outward traveling alfvn waves are mainly generated near the sun below the alfvnic critical point , as has been originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , even if generated , the inward waves can not propagate above the alfvnic critical point and should have the local origin . moreover ,",
    "analysis of helios and voyager data @xcite showed that fluctuations in the solar wind become less imbalanced with increasing distance from the sun .",
    "@xcite also found that the regions of strong shear are associated with a rapid evolution from the purely alfvnic state to a more balanced state with accelerated turbulent cascade .",
    "these observations are puzzling in view of long known result of @xcite that the kelvin - helmholtz instability is inefficient in the solar wind .",
    "the same result , strong enhancement of the turbulence cascade in strong shear flows , has been confirmed later in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "therefore , although enhancement of the turbulent cascade by the shear flows in seen both in the solar wind observations and numerical simulations , many aspects of its physics still remain unclear .    from the theory of neutral fluid turbulence it is long known @xcite that the strong background shears can significantly affect turbulent dynamics .",
    "namely , if the background velocity shear exceeds the velocity shears in turbulent fluctuations , then the distortion of fluctuations driven by the background shear dominates over nonlinear interactions .",
    "this leads to the enhancement of the turbulence cascade rate and formation of so - called tchen spectrum @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 is a wave number and @xmath4 is one dimensional spectrum of the fluctuations ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider strong incompressible imbalanced alfvnic turbulence in the presence of background shear flows . by means of scaling analysis",
    "we show that , similarly to the fluid turbulence , the strong shear flow can significantly increase the energy cascade rate , resulting in the formation of the tchen - like spectrum .",
    "this is especially crucial for the dominant alfvn waves , because their evolution driven by the subdominant component is naturally weak because of the weak subdominant waves .",
    "our analysis shows that this mechanism can explain strong enhancements of turbulent dynamics observed in the solar - wind shear flows .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "existing models of imbalanced magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulence are reviewed in sec .",
    "phenomenology of the tchen model of strong imbalanced mhd turbulence in the presence of strong velocity shear is developed in sec .",
    "application of the obtained results to the solar wind turbulence is discussed is sec .",
    "4 and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we consider incompressible mhd turbulence in the presence of the background magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the elssser variables @xmath6representing eigenfunctions of counter propagating alfvn waves , are considered as the fundamental variables most useful to study mhd turbulence @xcite . in equation ( [ eq:0 ] )",
    "@xmath7 is the mass density , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are velocity and magnetic field fluctuations respectively .",
    "the dynamics of the elssser variables is governed by the incompressible mhd equations @xmath10here @xmath11 is the total ( hydrodynamic plus magnetic ) pressure and @xmath12 is the alfvn velocity . in equations ( [ eq:01 ] )",
    "we have neglected viscous and resistive dissipative terms , which become important on smaller scales .",
    "alfvn waves represent exact solutions of the ideal incompressible mhd equations .",
    "this means that if in equations ( [ eq:01 ] ) , say , @xmath13 is zero initially , than @xmath14 is a nonlinear solution of arbitrary form . @xcite and @xcite realized that due to this property , the mhd turbulence can be described as nonlinear interactions of oppositely propagating alfvn wave packets .",
    "the first model of mhd turbulence developed by @xcite and @xcite assumed that the turbulence is isotropic .",
    "however , the mean magnetic field has a strong effect on the turbulence , in contrast to the mean flow in the hydrodynamic turbulence , which can be eliminated by the galilean transformation .",
    "the anisotropy of mhd turbulence had been already seen in very early numerical simulations @xcite .    a theory of anisotropic balanced ( under balanced we mean turbulence with equal energy of counter - propagating alfvn waves ) mhd turbulence was proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model implies that the dynamics of turbulence is dominated by the perpendicular cascade with respect to the mean magnetic field whereas the parallel size of turbulent eddies ( wave packets ) is determined by the critical balance condition . for wave packets with",
    "characteristic parallel length scales @xmath15 and perpendicular length scale @xmath16 , this condition implies that the characteristic time scale of wave packet collision @xmath17 is equal to the characteristic time scale of the energy cascade @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is characteristic value of the elsasser variables at scale @xmath20 . as a result one arrives at kolmogorov - like phenomenology with @xmath21 .",
    "equivalently , for 1-dimensional perpendicular energy spectrum @xmath22 we have @xmath23    in the case of imbalanced mhd turbulence situation becomes more complicated .",
    "assuming local turbulence , and noting that for alfvn waves elsasser fields @xmath24 are perpendicular to the mean magnetic field , it can be readily estimated that the nonlinear terms @xmath25 are of the order @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the straining rates for @xmath24 are @xcite @xmath27if typical parallel length scale of colliding wave packets is @xmath28 , then characteristic timescale of their collision @xmath29 can be estimated as @xmath30 note that if to packets of size @xmath31 are counter - propagating with speed @xmath32 , then collision time @xmath33 , but because we perform scaling analysis , this factor of 2 is ignored similar to other studies @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath34 is the dominant component ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "dynamics of the turbulence depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath36if @xmath37 , then subdominant wave packet is cascaded to smaller scale during one collision and we have the strong turbulence .",
    "then for the energy cascade rate of the subdominant component we have @xmath38 this does not imply that the dominant wave packet is also cascaded during one collision .",
    "regarding the cascade of the dominant waves , various models give different predictions . here",
    "we shortly consider main features and predictions of several recent models of anisotropic imbalanced mhd turbulence . according to the model developed by @xcite the straining rate imposed by the subdominant waves on dominant ones , @xmath39 ,",
    "is imposed coherently over a time @xmath40 and therefore cascade time for the dominant waves is @xmath41for the energy cascade rate of the dominant waves this equation gives @xmath42    according to the model developed by @xcite , the strainings of the dominant waves by the subdominant ones are summed up randomly .",
    "this assumption makes cascade of the dominant waves weaker : @xmath43    yet another model of strong imbalanced mhd turbulence was developed by @xcite .",
    "the key feature of this model is that the turbulent fluctuations of the dominant component cascade nonlocally , from @xmath44 to significantly larger @xmath45 where @xmath46 . as a result ,",
    "the subdominant waves become more anisotropic than the dominant waves .",
    "this model predicts the cascade rate of dominant waves between the cascade rates predicted by two other models ( equations [ eq:06 ] and [ eq:07 ] ) , but there is no simple analytical expression for this cascade rate .",
    "@xcite was the first who recognized that the strong background shear can significantly affect the energy cascade rate and statistical properties of the hydrodynamic turbulence . in literature there",
    "exist several ways to obtain the tchen spectrum , including spectral energy budget analysis @xcite , heisenberg s eddy viscosity model @xcite and scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "consider turbulent fluctuations of neutral fluid with characteristic excitation scale @xmath47 and amplitude @xmath48 imposed in the mean flow with strong velocity shear , @xmath49 .",
    "then the distortion of a turbulent eddy by the background flow is stronger than the distortion by the turbulent flows ( nonlinear interaction with other eddies ) .",
    "the main effect of the sheared mean flow is stretching the eddies along the flow , which in the wave number space is equivalent to the increasing perpendicular ( with respect to the mean flow ) wave number .",
    "consequently , the background shear flow transfers the energy to higher wave numbers faster than the nonlinear interactions .    if the fluctuations can be treated at outer scales as quasi - isotropic , then at some scale @xmath50 where the mean shear is greater that the inverse eddy turnover time @xmath51 , the effective cascade timescale shortens and becomes equal @xmath52 ( although it has to be noted that nonlinear interactions are still necessary to ensure decorrelation of fluctuations and isotropic redistribution of fluctuation energy ) .",
    "if the energy cascade rate is denoted by @xmath53 , then from equation @xmath54 we have @xmath55for one dimensional energy spectrum @xmath56 this gives @xmath57therefore , tchen s model predicts that at relatively large scales , where the shear imposed by the turbulent fluctuations is still weaker then the mean flow shear , the energy spectrum should be inversely proportional to the wave number , @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath3 increases , the shear associated with the turbulent eddies @xmath58 also increases and starting from the wave number where @xmath59 the turbulence is expected to follow kolmogorov s phenomenology .",
    "there is significant evidence supporting tchen spectrum both in boundary layer experiments and the atmospheric boundary layer measurements [ see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "here we develop an analogue of the tchen phenomenology for the mhd turbulence .",
    "consider incompressible imbalanced mhd turbulence is the presence of the background magnetic field @xmath60 and background shear flow @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "linear dynamics of mhd waves in such a flow have been studied by @xcite . along with other phenomena ( such as possibility of over - reflection and mutual transformation of different mhd modes ) ,",
    "one of the main effects produced by the velocity shear is distortion of waves . in the wave number space",
    "it is equivalent to the linear variation in time of the perpendicular wave number , @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "similarly to the hydrodynamic case , this is equivalent to the spectral transfer of energy in the perpendicular wave number space .",
    "therefore , with strong velocity shear one can expect an enhancement of the cascade rate and formation of the tchen - type spectrum in the mhd turbulence .    here",
    "we consider the strongly imbalanced turbulence , the reason for which is twofold .",
    "first , the turbulence in the fast solar wind is strongly imbalanced , and there is plenty of in - situ observations to compare with our theoretical predictions .",
    "second , in the imbalanced turbulence the cascade rate of the dominant component is reduced significantly because of the low amplitudes of subdominant waves responsible for the spectral transport in the dominant component .",
    "consequently , even relatively weak background shear can strongly accelerate cascade in the dominant component .",
    "let us assume that the turbulence is excited isotropically at the ( injection ) outer scale @xmath65 with the characteristic amplitudes of dominant and subdominant components @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "suppose that the background velocity shear is moderately strong , exceeding velocity shears in the subdominant component , but still smaller than the shears in the dominant component : @xmath68 in this case the cascade of subdominant waves is not significantly affected by the background shear and the spectral flux is still given by equation ( [ eq:04a ] ) , @xmath69    on the contrary , the strainings of dominant waves by the background shear exceed the strainings imposed by the subdominant waves .",
    "then , as in the tchen fluid model , the cascade time for dominant waves is effectively shortened to @xmath70 and the cascade rate is accelerated to @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 . in terms of this new cascade rate ,",
    "the spectral flux in the wave number space at @xmath74 is given by @xmath75because of energy conservation , @xmath76 is constant and all terms in this expression are @xmath3-independent , which results in the following one - dimensional wave number spectrum of energy : @xmath77    the relative strength of the cascades generated by the background and turbulent velocity shears can be conveniently described by the critical parameter @xmath78the cascade is dominated by the background shear and the @xmath0 spectrum ( eq:12 ) is formed at scales where @xmath79 .",
    "the turbulent shears dominate at @xmath80 forming the @xmath81 spectrum .",
    "equations ( [ eq:09]-[eq:12a ] ) represent our model of the imbalanced mhd turbulence modified by the velocity shear .",
    "if the imbalanced mhd turbulence follows phenomenology by @xcite , then formation of tchen s spectrum is expected if the background shear is strong enough in sense of equation ( [ eq:09 ] ) , i.e. when the cascade rate due to background shear ( @xmath82 ) is larger than the cascade rate due to the turbulent shears at the injection scale ( @xmath83 ) : @xmath84 in the cases where the turbulence follows phenomenology by @xcite with a weaker cascade of dominant waves , the tchen spectrum can be formed by the proportionally smaller background shear ( then the critical parameter @xmath85 should be modified correspondingly ) .    as the cascade generated by the background shear proceeds to smaller scales ,",
    "the tchen cascade rate @xmath73 remain the same . on the contrary ,",
    "the strainings imposed by the turbulent eddies become progressively stronger because of the stronger velocity gradients in the small - scale eddies",
    ". then @xmath86 decreases below @xmath87 and the tchen - type cascade eventually arrives to the spectral break @xmath88where @xmath89 , i.e. the background and turbulent shears become the same .",
    "the tchen wave number spectrum @xmath90 is formed at scales @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 , whereas the strongly turbulent spectrum @xmath94 is formed at smaller scales @xmath95 @xmath93 .",
    "recent studies based on in - situ observations have revieled that the fast - slow solar wind interface has two parts : a smooth `` boundary layer '' surrounding the fast wind , and a sharper `` discontinuity '' between the slow and intermediate solar winds @xcite .",
    "a relatively strong velocity shear was observed by ulysses over its first orbit in the transition area between the fast and slow solar winds at @xmath96 latitudes .",
    "the data analysis @xcite showed that the boundary layer separating two winds consists of two regions , the first one with the width @xmath97 @xmath98 and velocity difference @xmath99 @xmath100 and the second one with @xmath101 @xmath98 and @xmath102 @xmath100 .    the spectral brake between the `` energy containing range '' and the `` inertial range '' occurs at the spacecraft - frame frequency @xmath103 @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding break scale .",
    "it is well know that the power of inward propagating alfvn waves in the fast solar wind streams is about one order of magnitude lower than the power of outward waves [ see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ] . as the typical values in the fast solar wind",
    "we take @xmath105 @xmath100 for the subdominant wave amplitude at the scale @xmath93 @xcite and @xmath106 @xmath100 for the solar wind speed @xcite .    noting that @xmath107 and @xmath108 , with observed numerical values our model predicts @xmath109 as we see performed rough estimate",
    "gives the value which is the same order of magnitude as the observed spectral brake frequency .",
    "below @xmath110 our model predicts the tchen spectrum @xmath90 . although we do not claim that all observed @xmath90 spectra are generated by our mechanism , the correspondence between the model and observations is good enough to motivate further observational studies .",
    "in particular , as the break wave number @xmath111 between @xmath90 and @xmath94 spectra is proportional to the background shear @xmath73 , the presence of positive correlation between @xmath111 and @xmath73 in various data sets of fast solar wind streams would strongly support our mechanism .",
    "as it is known @xcite the @xmath0 spectrum is not observed in the slow solar wind .",
    "therefore another interesting direction of further research is to study weather this phenomenon is related to the absence of strong velocity shear in the slow solar wind .",
    "we developed a semi - phenomenological model of incompressible imbalanced mhd turbulence in the presence of sheared background flows .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : 1 ) the tchen - type spectrum @xmath90 can be generated by the background velocity shear exceeding the shears of the subdominant alfvn waves at the injection scale @xmath65 .",
    "\\2 ) the @xmath112 spectrum breaks down at the scale @xmath93 given by ( [ eq:13a ] ) , where the turbulent shears of the subdominant component become as strong as the background shear .",
    "the @xmath112 spectrum extends from @xmath65 to @xmath93 .",
    "it is long known , but still unexplained , that in the fast solar wind streams the spectral index of turbulent fluctuations at large scales is close to @xmath0 and the spectral break frequency is close to @xmath115 @xmath104 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these observations are compatible with the mechanism we propose here , which motivates its future verification by observations .",
