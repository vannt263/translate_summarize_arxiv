    "in this note we develop a method for determining the energy spectrum of relativistic schroedinger equation in finite differences @xmath0    which appear to describe a quantum black hole model with selfgravitating dust shell introduced in @xcite . here",
    "parameter @xmath1 is the bare mass of the shell , @xmath2 is the schwarzchild mass of the space - time outside the collapsing shell , @xmath3 is the ratio of schwarzchild masses inside and outside the shell , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is gravitational constant ) is the dimensionless area of the shell surface and @xmath6 are functions entering the schwarzchild line element .",
    "parameter @xmath7 where @xmath8 is planck mass ( @xmath9 is planck constant and @xmath10 is the speed of light ) .",
    "it becomes small in semiclassical ( @xmath11 ) limit . in this",
    "limit the finite shift in the argument of the wave function in ( [ main ] ) become small and one could us an approximate expression @xmath12 then the equation [ main ] becomes just a usual schroedinger of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics : @xmath13 this equation was studied in @xcite in details .",
    "there was an expression for the energy spectrum of bound states found and quasiclassical behaviour of the wave function studied .",
    "in this paper we will analyse the solutions of the exact equation ( [ main ] ) .",
    "the shift of the argument in the wave function is along the imaginary line , so the equation is naturally defined over some complex one dimensional manifold .",
    "the function @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) which enter the equation ( [ main ] ) is a branching function of its argument .",
    "so ( [ main ] ) is defined over the riemannian surface @xmath16 for the function ( [ f ] ) which is a two dimensional sphere glued from the two riemannian spheres @xmath17 and @xmath18 along the sides of the cut made along the interval @xmath19 of the real line .",
    "there are two points @xmath20 on the riemannian surface @xmath16 in @xmath17 and @xmath18 components , which are singular points of equation ( [ main ] ) .",
    "they differ by the different chooses of the sign of the function @xmath21 .",
    "the natural requirements on the wave function @xmath22 of a bound state is that it must decrease with @xmath23 but in our case we have two infinities in @xmath17 and @xmath18 components of @xmath16 .",
    "as it was argued in @xcite the two possibilities for @xmath23 have the following physical meaning . if one consider maximally extended spherically symmetric solution of einstein equations in vacuum ",
    "kruskal manifold @xcite , one finds that the radial coordinate @xmath24 take the same values on different sides of einstein - rosen bridge ( in @xmath25 and @xmath26 regions of kruskal manifold @xcite ) .",
    "so @xmath24 could tend to infinity twofold : either in @xmath27 region or in @xmath26 region .",
    "this complicated structure of kruskal manifold is mirrored in complicated structure of configuration space of quantum system ( the real section of @xmath16 ) which describe a selfgravitating dust shell .",
    "so the two possibilities for @xmath23 in @xmath17 and @xmath18 components of @xmath16 corresponds to the possibility for @xmath23 in @xmath27 and @xmath26 regions of kruskal space - time .",
    "but the requirements for the wave function to vanish at infinities are not all the requirements which a reasonable wave function of a physical state must satisfy .",
    "besides if must be one - valued function .    this requirement is satisfied automatically if we consider schroedinger equation over a complex plane ( or over the real line ) . but the equation ( [ main ] ) is defined over ( the real section of ) the riemannian surface @xmath16 .",
    "the two infinities in @xmath28 components are both singular points of equation .",
    "so the equation ( [ main ] ) is defined in fact over complex manifold which is two - dimensional sphere minus two points  a cylinder . but a cylinder possess a nontrivial cycle .",
    "the monodromy of solution along this nontrivial cycle is not identity in general .",
    "therefore , the requirement for the wave function to be one - valued function on the riemannian surface @xmath16 ( and on its real section ) become a nontrivial one . in what follows we will find the asymptotics of exact solutions of equation ( [ main ] ) at both infinities .",
    "the analysis of analytical properties of asymptotics and the requirement for one - valued solutions to decrease at infinities will lead us to defining of the mass spectrum for the equation ( [ main ] )",
    "let us find the asymptotic solutions of this equation at infinities in @xmath29 components of @xmath16 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite ( [ main ] ) in matrix form .",
    "if we truncate the tailor expansion @xmath30 on @xmath31-th item and expand asymptotically @xmath32 in powers of @xmath33 , we could rewrite ( [ main ] ) as @xmath34 where the upper signs correspond to @xmath17 and the lower ones to @xmath18 components .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a vector function @xmath35 then ( [ medium ] ) takes the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 where @xmath38 has the following form : @xmath39 with coefficients @xmath40 matrices @xmath41 are @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 after the change of variable @xmath45 equation ( [ matrix ] ) takes the form @xmath46 with matrices @xmath47    if we let @xmath48 then matrix equation ( [ matrix ] ) is equivalent to finite  -  difference equation ( [ main ] ) in asymptotic regions .",
    "there exist well - developed method for finding asymptotic solutions ( @xmath49 ) of matrix equations of ( [ matrix ] ) type @xcite .",
    "first we need to make a transformation @xmath50 such that matrix @xmath51 becomes diagonal : @xmath52 the eigen values @xmath53 could be found by equating the characteristic polynomial for matrix @xmath51 to zero : @xmath54 as a result we get an equation @xmath55 in the limit @xmath48 this equation is equivalent to the following one @xmath56    ( 0,0 )    # 1#2#3#4#5 @font    ( 5194,2168)(303,-4293 )    so we see that all the eigen values become double degenerate in the limit @xmath48 as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : cosinus ] .",
    "this means that the matrix @xmath51 could not be transformed to diagonal form in this limit , instead it could be transformed to jordanian form : @xmath57 it is convenient to rewrite all the matrices in the form of blocks of dimension @xmath58 : @xmath59 and in analogous way @xmath60 then the matrix @xmath61 could be found from the equation ( [ eqv ] ) which lead to the following system of recurrent equations : @xmath62 solving this system of equations gives @xmath61 in the following form @xmath63 the coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 are arbitrary and the form of asymptotic solution of equation ( [ matrix ] ) do not depend on them .",
    "so we will take @xmath66 for simplicity .",
    "matrices @xmath67 transform under ( [ transformation ] ) as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 are elements of the block @xmath70 of inverse matrix of transformation @xmath71 .",
    "the transformed matrix equation ( [ transformation ] ) could be reduced to a set of @xmath58 matrix equations with the help of one more transformation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a matrix of @xmath58 blocks such that after the transformation ( [ transf1 ] ) the system of equations ( [ matrix ] ) is rewritten as @xmath74 with matrix @xmath75 of block - diagonal form : @xmath76 expanding @xmath77 and solving equation ( [ eq : b ] ) in each power of @xmath78 one obtains for @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are defined in ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) and @xmath83 is @xmath58 matrix ( [ l ] ) .    the @xmath84 matrix system ( [ matrix ] ) is equivalent to the set of @xmath58 matrix systems of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is one of the @xmath79 .",
    "now we will construct solutions of the system of ordinary differential equations ( [ eq:2x2 ] ) .",
    "let us take @xmath87 then differential equation for @xmath88 will be @xmath89 where @xmath90 the last system of equations could be transformed to diagonal form because the determinant of matrix @xmath91 .",
    "the eigen values of matrix @xmath92 are @xmath93 . therefore taking the transformation matrix @xmath94",
    "one finds the form of transformed system @xmath95 with @xmath96 matrices @xmath97 which stand by @xmath98 and @xmath99 correspondingly could be transformed to diagonal form as well after one more substitution @xmath100 expanding @xmath101 and @xmath102 in powers of @xmath98 one could find the form of matrix @xmath102 solving matrix equation @xmath103 the result is @xmath104 where @xmath105    finally we are able to write down the asymptotic solution of system ( [ fine ] ) : @xmath106 where @xmath107 using this expression we could restore the asymptotic solution of initial matrix system of differential equations ( [ matrix ] ) and therefore the asymptotic solution of equation ( [ main ] ) could be written in the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 are some one - valued functions and @xmath110 are given by the expressions @xmath111    the coefficients @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( see ( [ l ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) ) are expressed through the elements @xmath114 of the matrix inverse to @xmath61 ( ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) ) . therefore in order to determine the asymptotic expression for solution of ( [ main ] ) we just need to calculate the inverse matrix @xmath71 .",
    "matrix @xmath61 has the form @xmath115 its determinant will not change if we subtract odd columns from even ones : @xmath116 the last expression could be written in the following form @xmath117 where @xmath118 is wandermond determinant @xmath119 using the well known rule of calculation of wandermond determinant we obtain for @xmath120 @xmath121 implementing the same trick for the calculation of corresponding minors @xmath122 we obtain the expression for the elements of inverse matrix @xmath71 : @xmath123 then @xmath124    the product and the sum entering last equation could be evaluated using the characteristic equation ( [ char ] ) for matrix @xmath38 ( [ a0 ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if one write the characteristic polynomial @xmath125 in the form @xmath126 which for @xmath127 large enough become approximately @xmath128 because all the eigen values of matrix @xmath38 become twice degenerate , as it is explained earlier , then @xmath129 exactly the required product .",
    "taking into account expression ( [ cosinus ] ) for @xmath125 in the limit @xmath48 one easily finds @xmath130 in a similar way @xmath131 and then @xmath132    if one substitute these expressions into ( [ eq : powers ] ) one finds that the powers of @xmath24 which describe the branching of solution at infinity become @xmath133 the plus or minus signs are taken at infinities in @xmath17 and @xmath18 components of @xmath16 correspondingly .",
    "having determined the form ( [ eq : branch ] ) of asymptotic solutions of equation ( [ main ] ) at infinities in @xmath17 and @xmath18 components of the riemannian surface @xmath16 we can try to impose the condition of decreasing of the wave function at both infinities .",
    "but the asymptotic expression for the solution ( [ eq : branch ] ) contains branching functions if powers @xmath134 and @xmath135 are not integer .",
    "this means that the asymptotic expression ( [ eq : branch ] ) could not be a good approximation for the one valued wave function @xmath22 .",
    "it is known from complex analysis , that if the powers @xmath134 and @xmath135 of @xmath24 in asymptotic expression ( [ eq : branch ] ) for the wave function @xmath22 are not integer numbers , the approximation ( [ eq : branch ] ) is valid only in some sector @xmath136 in the neighbourhood of infinity point .",
    "different approximations are valid in different overlaping sectors .",
    "this behaviour of the asymptotic approximation is called stokes phenomenon @xcite .",
    "but if both @xmath134 and @xmath135 are integers , the expression ( [ eq : branch ] ) is a good approximation for non - branching wave function everywhere in the punctured neighbourhoods of infinities .",
    "+ due two the double degeneracy of eigen values of matrix @xmath38 the infinite matrix equation is reduced to the infinite set of second order matrix equations .",
    "this second order equations can be analysed in the same way as we do this in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . and",
    "we conclude therefore that the wave function with needed boundary conditions on the both sides of the riemannian surface exists only in the situation described above - when @xmath137 and @xmath138 are integers .    the conditions for @xmath110 to be integers are equivalent to @xmath139 where * n * and * k * are integers .",
    "these conditions define the mass spectrum for the equation ( [ main ] ) .",
    "the the motion of dust shell in its own gravitational field is parameterised by three parameters  the bare mass of the shell @xmath1 , the schwarzchild mass which is measured at `` right '' infinity @xmath2 and the schwarzchild mass inside the shell ( or the mass at `` left '' infinity ) @xmath140 .",
    "there are two equations ( [ eq : mass ] ) on these three parameters , which we could solve for two of them .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of schwarzchild mass @xmath141 is parameterised by two discrete parameters * n * and * k * and one continuous ( for example @xmath142 ) .",
    "but if we restrict ourselves with situations when the gravitational field in which the shell moves is produced only by the shell itself , that is there is no space - time singularity inside the shell , then @xmath143 and the mass spectrum of such states is discrete .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : mass ] ) for the mass spectrum is valid only when @xmath144 when the square root expression entering ( [ eq : mass ] ) is well defined .",
    "this restriction corresponds to classical restriction on the trajectories of bound motion of the shell .",
    "if it is satisfied , then there exist some maximal radius of expansion of the shell @xmath145 .",
    "otherwise the shell could escape to infinity in its classical motion .",
    "for such shells first of conditions ( [ eq : mass ] ) disappears and the only left is @xmath146 it is remarkable that for light - like shells ( @xmath147 ) in their own gravitational field ( @xmath148 ) this quantization condition become ( we recall that @xmath149 ) @xmath150",
    "in this technical note we developed a method of constructing asymptotical solutions ( [ eq : branch ] ) of relativistic schroedinger equation in finite differences ( [ main ] ) , which describe a self - gravitating spherically symmetric dust shell of matter @xcite .",
    "this finite difference equation is defined over riemannian surface @xmath16 ( [ f ] ) .",
    "the configuration space of the system is the real section of this surface and has nontrivial geometry .",
    "this complicated geometry of configuration space of quantum system is due to complicated geometric structure of classical space - time manifold of self - gravitating shell .",
    "analysis of the behaviour of asymptotic solution on riemannian surface @xmath16 enabled us to write down quantization conditions ( [ eq : mass ] ) under which the one valued solution of ( [ main ] ) with physical boundary conditions exists .",
    "these quantization conditions define discrete spectrum for schwarzchild mass @xmath141 if the mass inside the shell is zero .",
    "the main result of this paper is that this spectrum up to the numerical factors coincides with the spectrum , found in @xcite in large black hole approximation and in @xcite in quasiclassical approximation .",
    "this discrete mass spectrum is of the form @xmath151 for the light - like shells ( shells with bare mass @xmath147 ) .",
    "this form of quantum black hole spectrum was extensively discussed by many authors @xcite ."
