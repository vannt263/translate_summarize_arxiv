    "the @xmath5 galaxy fsc  10214 + 4724 was one of the most remarkable objects detected by the  survey .",
    "originally proposed to be the most luminous galaxy known ( rowan - robinson 1991 ) , multi - wavelength observations subsequently showed that it is lensed by an intervening @xmath6 galaxy , boosting its intrinsic emission by a factor of @xmath7  10100 ( depending on the location and extent of the unlensed emission with respect to the caustic ; e.g.,broadhurst & lehar 1995 ; downes 1995 ; trentham 1995 ; eisenhardt 1996 ; evans 1999 ) .",
    "optical and near - ir spectroscopic / polarimetric observations have unambiguously shown that fsc  10214 + 4724 hosts an obscured active galactic nucleus ( agn ; e.g.,elston 1994 ; soifer 1995 ; goodrich 1996 ) .",
    "multi - wavelength analyses have suggested that the agn is powerful ( e.g. ,  goodrich 1996 ; granato 1996 ; green & rowan - robinson 1996 ) , although it is generally accepted that star - formation activity dominates the bolometric output ( e.g.,rowan - robinson 1993 ; rowan - robinson 2000 ) .",
    "the lensing - corrected properties of fsc  10214 + 4724 are similar to those of  galaxies ( e.g. ,  blain 2002 ; ivison 2002 ; smail 2002 ; chapman 2003 ; neri 2003 ) : it lies at @xmath8 , is optically faint with @xmath9  25 , has an 850@xmath10 m flux density of a few mjy and a 1.4  ghz flux density of @xmath0  25  @xmath10jy , is massive ( a molecular gas mass of @xmath11@xmath12  @xmath13 ) , and has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath14  l@xmath15 ( e.g. ,  rowan - robinson 1993 ; downes 1995 ; eisenhardt 1996 ) .",
    "galaxies appear to be massive galaxies undergoing intense star - formation activity and are likely to be the progenitors of the local @xmath7  @xmath16 early - type galaxy population ( e.g. ,  blain 2004 ; chapman 2004 ) .",
    "deep x - ray observations have shown that a large fraction ( at least @xmath0  40% ; alexander 2003b , 2004 ) of the  galaxy population is actively fuelling its black holes during this period of intense star formation , which can account for a significant fraction of the black - hole growth in massive galaxies ( alexander 2004 ) .",
    "the agn in fsc  10214 + 4724 was identified via optical / near - ir observations , and the large lensing boost of the agn emission provides interesting insight into agn activity in the  galaxy population .    in this letter we present the results from a @xmath0  20  ks observation of fsc  10214 + 4724 with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( hereafter _ chandra _ ; weisskopf et  al .",

    "although this observation achieves the equivalent sensitivity of an up - to @xmath0  4  ms  exposure ( e.g. ,  a 10-count source has a full - band flux of @xmath7  @xmath48  erg  @xmath36  s@xmath3 for a lensing boost of @xmath49 ; compare to table  9 in alexander 2003a ) , only a few x - ray counts are detected .",
    "the @xmath0  10 counts in the soft band correspond to a significant detection in the rest - frame band while the @xmath0  4 counts in the hard band correspond to a weak detection in the rest - frame 6.626.3  kev band .",
    "the soft - band flux is @xmath0  10 times below the 2  @xmath28  constraint reported in lawrence ( 1994 ) and the hard - band flux is @xmath0  20 times below the  upper limit reported in iwasawa ( 2001 ) .",
    "we re - examined the  pspc image and could not find unambiguous evidence of x - ray emission at the location of fsc  10214 + 4724 . from our analyses of the  pspc image we determine a 3  @xmath28 0.52.0  kev upper limit of @xmath50  erg  @xmath36  s@xmath3 . the observed ( uncorrected for gravitational lensing )",
    "full - band luminosity is @xmath51  2.4  @xmath52  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "the band ratio ( i.e. ,  the ratio of the hard to soft - band count rate ) of fsc  10214 + 4724 implies an effective photon index of @xmath53 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "this is generally consistent with that of an unobscured agn ( i.e. ,  @xmath54  2.0 ; e.g.,nandra & pounds 1994 ; george 2000 ) ; however , due to the large uncertainties and comparatively high redshift of fsc  10214 + 4724 , this could also be consistent with a column density of @xmath55  @xmath36 at @xmath5 ( for an intrinsic x - ray spectral slope of @xmath56 ) .",
    "the latter would be more consistent with the obscured agn classification of fsc  10214 + 4724 than the former ( e.g. ,  elston 1994 ; soifer 1995 ) .",
    "see  3.1 for further obscuration constraints .",
    "the gravitational lensing boost of fsc  10214 + 4724 is unknown in the x - ray band .",
    "since the lensing boost is a function of the source size , basic constraints can be placed from the extent of the x - ray emission ( e.g. ,  see  2 of broadhurst & lehar 1995 ) . in figure",
    "2 we show the full - band profiles ( s - n and e - w orientations ) of fsc  10214 + 4724 and compare them to the on - axis  acis - s point spread function ( psf ) . while this analysis is limited by small - number statistics , the extent of fsc  10214 + 4724 is consistent with that of an unresolved x - ray source ( @xmath0  1@xmath57 ) .",
    "the half - power radius of fsc  10214 + 4724 ( i.e. ,  the radius over which the central seven counts are distributed ; ) is also consistent with that of an unresolved x - ray source .",
    "although somewhat uncertain , this suggests that the magnification in the x - ray band is @xmath7  25 ( e.g. ,  compare to the extent and magnification found in the 2.05  @xmath10 m nicmos observations of evans 1999 ) .",
    "we can compare this estimate to the expected lensing boost from other observations .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "observations and source model of nguyen ( 1999 ) suggest that the central source ( i.e. ,  the emitting agn ) is @xmath0  100  pc from the caustic , indicating that the magnification of the agn emission is likely to be @xmath0  100 .",
    "the strong optical polarisation and prominent high - excitation emission lines also indicate that the caustic lies close to the central source ( e.g. ,  broadhurst & lehar 1995 ; lacy 1998 ; simpson 2004 ) .",
    "-axis corresponds to the offset from the wavdetect - determined position , and the @xmath58-axis error bars correspond to 1  @xmath28 uncertainties ( gehrels 1986 ) .",
    "the  psf was simulated using the ciao tool mkpsf and has been normalised to the peak of the s - n orientation profile .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio of the data is low , the profiles and the half - power radius ( @xmath0  05075 ) are consistent with those of an unresolved source , suggesting a lensing boost in the x - ray band of @xmath7  25 ; see ",
    "with a @xmath0  20  ks  acis - s observation we have shown that fsc  10214 + 4724 is comparatively weak at x - ray energies ( @xmath59  erg  s@xmath3 , @xmath60  erg  s@xmath3 , and @xmath61  erg  s@xmath3 for a lensing boost of @xmath62 ) .",
    "previous studies have suggested that fsc  10214 + 4724 hosts both a powerful starburst and a powerful agn ( goodrich 1996 ; granato 1996 ; green & rowan - robinson 1996 ) . in this final section",
    "we predict the expected x - ray emission from both star formation and agn activity in fsc  10214 + 4724 and compare it to the observed x - ray emission .",

    "are similar to those found in the rest - frame ultra - violet , suggesting that the radio emission is lensed by a factor of ( eisenhardt 1996 ) . in figure",
    "3 we show the rest - frame 1.4  ghz radio luminosity density versus the rest - frame 0.58.0  kev luminosity for fsc  10214 + 4724 ; the rest - frame 0.58.0  kev luminosity was calculated from the rest - frame 1.66.6  kev luminosity ( observed soft band ) assuming @xmath37 and is shown for a range of lensing boosts . the rest - frame emission from fsc  10214 + 4724 is entirely consistent with that expected from star formation for the range of probable lensing boosts at radio wavelengths . the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio is also concordant with that expected from star formation [ @xmath67 ; see  4.1.1 of bauer 2004 ] when appropriate @xmath68 corrections and lensing boosts are applied [ @xmath37 with lensing boosts of 25100 in the x - ray band , and the host galaxy templates of mannucci ( 2001 ) with a lensing boost of 100 in the @xmath69-band ] .",
    "these results imply that the agn in fsc  10214 + 4724 is either heavily obscured or intrinsically weak",
    ".    we can estimate the instrinsic luminosity of the agn in fsc  10214 + 4724 using the [ oiii]@xmath635007 luminosity ( e.g. ,  mulchaey 1994 ; bassani 1999 ) .",
    "taking the [ oiii]@xmath635007 luminosity from serjeant ( 1998 ) , the [ oiii]@xmath635007 to x - ray correlation of mulchaey ( 1994 ) , and assuming the lensing boost to the [ oiii]@xmath635007 emission - line region is @xmath70 ( simpson 2004 ) , the predicted rest - frame 0.58.0  kev luminosity is @xmath71  erg  s@xmath3 ( with a variance of @xmath52  erg  s@xmath3 ) ; see figure  3 . , a typical intrinsic x - ray spectral slope for agns .",
    "] these predicted x - ray luminosities are within the range expected for quasars and would be even higher if the [ oiii]@xmath635007 emission - line region suffers from reddening ( e.g. ,  elston 1994 ; soifer 1995 ; cf serjeant 1998 ) .",
    "since the lensing boost to the [ oiii]@xmath635007 emission - line region is a lower limit , these constraints should be considered upper limits . however , given that the [ oiii]@xmath635007 emission - line region is likely to be more extended than the central source , the [ oiii]@xmath635007 emission is unlikely to be much more magnified than the x - ray emission .",
    "these results suggest that the agn in fsc  10214 + 4724 is powerful . however , the rest - frame 1.626.3  kev luminosity is approximately 12 orders of magnitude below the constraint estimated from the [ oiii]@xmath635007 luminosity .",
    "this is significant since rest - frame @xmath72  kev emission is not easily attenuated [ e.g. ,  one order of magnitude of extinction at @xmath72  kev requires compton - thick obscuration ( @xmath73  @xmath36 ) ; see appendix  b in deluit & courvoisier 2003 ] . hence",
    ", if fsc  10214 + 4724 hosts a quasar , as previously suggested , then it must be obscured by compton - thick material ; these general conclusions are consistent with those found for other _ iras _ galaxies of similar luminosity ( e.g. ,  iwasawa 2001 ; wilman 2003 ) . under this assumption ,",
    "the observed x - ray emission from the agn would be due to reflection and scattering and a strong fe  k@xmath31 emission line should be detected . with only @xmath0  14 x - ray counts , the current x - ray observations can not provide good constraints on the presence of fe  k@xmath31 ; however , a scheduled @xmath0  50  ks  observation ( pi : k.  iwasawa ) may be able to place some constraints .",
    "the lensing - corrected properties of fsc  10214 + 4724 are similar to those of  galaxies ( see  1 ) , sources that are probably the progenitors of massive galaxies ( and hence massive black holes ) in the local universe .",
    "the steep x - ray spectral slope and moderately luminous x - ray emission of fsc  10214 + 4724 contrasts with the x - ray properties of the five x - ray detected  galaxies classified as agns in alexander ( 2003b ) ; however , the x - ray properties of fsc  10214 + 4724 are similar to those of the two x - ray detected galaxies classified as unknown ( see figure  3 ) . since we know that an agn is present in fsc  10214 + 4724 ( possibly powerful and compton thick ) , this suggests that further unidentified agns may be present in the  galaxy population and the @xmath0  40% agn fraction ( alexander 2003b , 2004 ) should be considered a lower limit .",
    "many compton - thick agns may be present in ultra - deep x - ray surveys ( e.g. ,  fabian 2002 ) .",
