    "with the remarkable advances in the ability to fabricate the nanostructures , it is possible to explore the electronic devices based on a single molecule , i. e. the single - molecular transistor ( smt),@xcite which might promise to be potential candidates for nano - electronics and also provide with an controllable tool in studying the fundamental physics in nanometer scale .",
    "it has been found that the transport through the single - molecular transistor might exhibit profound many - body correlated effects at low temperature , such as the coulomb blockade or the kondo effect.@xcite an important feature for the smt is its sensitivity to the local molecular vibration , which will have profound impacts on the transport properties.@xcite this may also be true in some quantum dot(qd ) systems whenever there is a strong coupling between the dot electron and local phonon mode .",
    "in addition , the smt is usually connected to the outside gates via the leads .",
    "since the applied bias voltage to the smt is within nanometers , a small bias might cause to substantial field effect , thus the transport through a smt or qd is in general a nonequilibrium process .",
    "theoretically , many efforts have been made towards the quantum transport through the smt or qd with these features taken into proper account .",
    "theoretical approaches developed in this field include the kinetic equation method,@xcite the rate equation approach,@xcite the nonequilibrium quantum theory,@xcite and more recently the numerical renormalization group calculation.@xcite in doing such investigations , several groups have already accounted for the electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) , many - body effects , or nonequilibrium properties .",
    "@xcite however , different results may be obtained by different treatments of these effects.@xcite although the numerical renormalization group method can well predict the equilibrium properties of the system , it can not be applied to the nonequilibrium situation directly . while regarding to the present systems , a theory capable of dealing with both nonequilibrium and strong epi situations",
    "should be favorite .",
    "one candidate , the keldysh green s function , has shown to be successful for the nonequilibrium systems.@xcite within this framework the nonequilibrium dyson equations are solved self - consistently , in which the self energies due to the epi can be calculated by the standard many - body diagrammatic technique,@xcite or by using the self - consistent born approximation.@xcite such an approach can meet the present concerns , and can be generalized to account for the effects arising from the phonon dynamics itself.@xcite but , in general , the calculations are complicate as self - consistent integrals are encountered .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented by directly diagonalizing the epi terms with a canonical transformation,@xcite as long as the phonons are in the thermodynamic equilibrium and the fluctuation in phonons can be neglected . by an improved treatment in the decoupling approximation as presented in the present work , which differs from the majority of previous publications,@xcite the electron can be properly decoupled from phonon system , and yet permits to straightforward solutions in a compact , analytic form .    in this paper , by combining the nonequilibrium keldysh green s function technique with the canonical transformation for the electron - phonon system , we intend to study the quantum transport through the smt in the presence of finite bias and strong local epi , with special attention paid to the effect of the improved decoupling treatment for the electron - phonon system on the spectral function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii",
    ", an anderson - holstein model is introduced for the smt in the presence of local epi , then our main theoretical framework is described , in which the commonly used procedure for decoupling the electron - phonon system is carefully reexamined . in section iii ,",
    "the numerical results for the spectral function of the smt electron is demonstrated and discussed , including both the dressing effects due to the epi and the joint effects caused by its interplay with the smt - leads coupling .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is predicted that the profile of the spectral function for the smt electron can be manipulated at low temperature by tuning the chemical potentials in the leads .",
    "consequently , the phonon sidebands in the spectral function may be quite asymmetric with respect to the renormalized smt level , indicating a broken electron - hole symmetry . in section iv , it is shown how the effect of the different decoupling approximation on the spectral function manifests itself in the conductances of the smt at zero temperature and finite temperatures , which might yield nearly the same results at high temperature , but definitely different behaviors at zero temperature .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion is drawn .",
    "as shown in fig.[configure ] , our model system is a single electron level in a smt or qd , which is coupled to the local vibration mode as well as to two metallic leads . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves exclusively to the effect of the epi and chemical potentials in two leads , thus ignore other factors , such as the intricacies of the real smt , coulomb interaction and spin effect .",
    "the model hamiltonian can be then expressed as @xmath0 where the first two terms of the hamiltonian represent the noninteracting electron gas in the leads and the local vibration mode of the smt , respectively , namely , @xmath1 here the operator @xmath2 @xmath3 creates ( annihilates ) a conduction electron with momentum @xmath4 and energy @xmath5 in the left ( l ) or the right ( r ) lead , @xmath6 is the vibrational frequency of the molecule , and @xmath7 @xmath8 is the phonon creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "the third term @xmath9 describes the coupling between the smt electron and local phonon mode with strength @xmath10 , @xmath11 { \\bf d}^{\\dag } { \\bf d},\\label{h_d}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 @xmath13 is the corresponding creation ( annihilation ) operator of the smt or qd electron associated with the energy @xmath14 .",

    "this reveals that the interaction between the smt electron and the local phonon mode results in an effective phonon - mediated coupling between the smt and the lead electrons . as in dealing with the localized polaron @xcite ,",

    "when the operator @xmath32 is replaced by its expectation value , the hamiltonian eq.([h_decoupled ] ) is decoupled from the phonon operator , then the interacting lesser green function may be separated : @xmath51 and similarly , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the dressed greater ( lesser ) green function for a dressed smt electron governed by @xmath54 , and the factor @xmath55 arises from the trace of the phonon parts @xmath56 or @xmath57 , respectively , @xcite @xmath58.\\label{phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that because @xmath59 , the decoupling approximation used in the majority of previous publications,@xcite which directly decouples the retarded ( advanced ) green function as @xmath60 has ignored the difference between the @xmath35 and @xmath61 in the expression of @xmath62 .",
    "although such approximation works well at high temperature , because @xmath63 , it does make difference at low temperature because of vanishing @xmath35 .",
    "we shall further discuss this point latter .    by using the identity @xmath64",
    ", the greater and lesser green functions can be respectively expanded as @xmath65 where the index @xmath66 stands for the number of phonons involved , and @xmath67 are the coefficients depending on temperature and the strength of epi . at finite temperature , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath66-th bessel function of complex argument . at zero temperature",

    "] , the effect of the epi and temperature on the spectral functions of the smt electron are evaluated . for comparison ,",
    "the spectral function without the epi at @xmath91 is also shown , which exhibits a single resonant peak at @xmath14 with a lorentzian .",
    "compared with the epi - free case , with finite epi , the resonant peak at @xmath14 in the spectral function is red - shifted by @xmath92 , and the spectral peak is sharpened .",
    "this results from the renormalized effects on the smt level and the dressing effect on the tunnelling matrix elements @xmath93 due to the epi .",
    "more noticeably , new satellite peaks may appear at @xmath94 in the spectral function , implying that due to the epi the ground state for the coupled system may possess finite components involving @xmath66 phonons .",
    "for later convenience , we label the resonant peak located at @xmath95 as the zero - phonon - band , and the satellite peaks located at @xmath94 as the @xmath96-th phonon sidebands . in general , these phonon sidebands are not symmetric with respect to @xmath95 . by using the identity @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    ", it can be seen that the sum rule for the spectral function still holds in the presence of epi , namely @xmath99    as shown in fig.[a - lambda - t ] , the weight of each peak , defined as the integrated area under the peak divided by @xmath100 and denoted by @xmath101 , is sensitive to the epi strength and temperature",
    ". we can further define sum of the spectral weights of the @xmath102-th and @xmath85-th phonon sidebands as @xmath103 fig.[wn ] shows that when @xmath10 or @xmath87 increases , the spectral weight of the zero - phonon band , @xmath104 decreases monotonically ; while the phonon sideband , @xmath105 , gets lager first , then reaches a maximum value for a certain epi strength or temperature , and decreases again .",
    "this reflects that when increasing the temperature or epi strength , the occupation probability of the phonon sideband increases , keeping the conservation of the total spectral weight , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "note that these variation trends are not in contradiction with fig.[a - lambda - t ] , where the heights of both the zero - phonon peak and phonon sidebands increase as temperature gets higher , as the corresponding widths are narrowed simultaneously .",

    "and the phonon sidebands , whose lineshapes may vary abruptly at certain frequency , can be nonvanishing in both sides of the zero - phonon band , even at zero temperature .",
    "this is quite different from the usual independent boson model , according to which , the phonon sidebands have nothing to do with the lead chemical potentials , and at zero temperature , they should vanish on the negative energy side of the zero - phonon band of the hole .",
    "the unusual behavior of the present spectral function can be understood with eqs.([a ] ) and ( [ g^<>_tilde ] ) , in which @xmath115 , and @xmath116 in general depends on the fermi function of @xmath117 in the left ( right ) lead , and thus on the chemical potential , @xmath118 , respectively . at zero temperature ,",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath67 vanish for negative @xmath66 , therefore only the zero - phonon band of the spectral function can both the lesser and greater green function contribute to ; while the phonon sideband below the zero - phonon band results from the @xmath116 , and that above the zero - phonon band comes from the @xmath115 .",
    "recalling that the lesser and greater green functions @xmath119 correspond to the dressed smt electron and hole propagator , which are proportional to the occupation number , @xmath120 , for the smt electron , or @xmath121 for the hole , respectively .",
    "different from the independent boson model , where @xmath120 is fixed to either zero or one at @xmath91 , as the fermi level for the isolate system is well defined , in the present non - equilibrium model , due to the tunnelling coupling the occupation of the smt electron is determined by the chemical potentials at the left and right leads when the system approaches a steady state .",
    "thus , by tuning the lead chemical potentials , @xmath120 can take any value between zero and one , consequently , even at @xmath91 the contribution from both the electron and hole to the spectral function of the smt need considering .",
    "at low temperature the smt electron and hole can only emit phonons , so the phonon sidebands below the zero - phonon band come from the occupative smt electron , while those above the zero - phonon band originate from the smt hole .",
    "if there is a partial occupation in the zero - phonon band for the smt electron , it is required to carefully examine the contribution from both electron and hole .",
    "it is the different treatment of @xmath120 that leads to the unusual behavior of the phonon sidebands at zero temperature .",
    "the spectral function can be explicitly expressed as functions of the bias and @xmath20 , the average of two lead potentials relative to the renormalized smt level as defined in the section ii , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath122 . in this way",
    "the effect due to the bias and due to the @xmath20 on the spectral function will be considered separately .",
    "we have found that the @xmath20 mostly affects the lineshape of the spectral function in the present model .",
    "four typical configurations of the lead chemical potentials in fig.[a - mu ] are divided into two categories : ( 1 ) the @xmath123 , namely the smt level is partially filled .",
    "then for both bias in fig.[a - mu](a ) and fig.[a - mu](b ) , the resonant tunnelling may take place .",
    "( 2 ) the @xmath20 deviates from @xmath95 significantly compared with the band - width @xmath124 , so that the smt level is either fully occupied or totally empty , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath125 ( fig.[a - mu](c ) ) , or @xmath126 ( fig.[a - mu](d ) ) , in which no resonant tunnelling can occur .    in fig.[a - mu](a ) , both chemical potentials in the leads align exactly with the renormalized smt level , where and the lineshape of each phonon sideband exhibits discontinuity at certain frequency .",
    "this is similar to the case @xmath90 ( _ cf .",
    "fig.[a - lambda - t ] ) , except for that the spectral function in fig.[a - mu](a ) is symmetric with respect to @xmath95 , while that in fig.[a - lambda - t ] is asymmetric .",
    "this is understandable , because at zero bias and zero temperature there exist a well - defined boundary , @xmath127 , separating the smt electron from hole .",
    "the symmetric spectral function is an exception when the renormalized smt level happens to coincide with the boundary and @xmath128 . in fig.[a - mu](b ) , when the bias is large enough to enclose the most part of the zero - phonon band , both distributions of the smt electron or hole in the zero - phonon band become lorenzian , and so does the lineshape of each phonon sideband . strictly speaking , the spectral function in fig.[a - mu](b )",
    "is not symmetric around @xmath95 as @xmath129 , but the asymmetric part can be hardly discerned for the present case .",
    "it is noticed that whenever one of the phonon sidebands enters the bias region , there will be the phonon - assisted tunnelling process .",
    "compare fig.[a - mu](b ) to ( a ) , it is evident that the bias is not only important in determining the profile of each phonon sideband , but also crucial in controlling the phonon - assisted tunnelling .",
    "it is interesting to observe that when @xmath126 ( fig.[a - mu](d ) ) , which corresponds to the one - hole picture , the usual result following the independent boson model with one hole@xcite is recovered ; on the other hand , when @xmath125 as in fig.[a - mu](c ) , which corresponds to the picture of one - electron , the spectral function is reversed with respect to @xmath95 compared with ( d ) .",
    "comparison among the four configurations shows that the @xmath20 relative to @xmath95 has played a decisive role in determining the occupation of the smt level , or equivalently the partition between the smt electron and hole .",
    "the spectral function has been found to have the symmetry as follows , @xmath130 and @xmath131 compared to the epi - free case , the spectral function in the epi is generally asymmetric with respect to @xmath95 unless @xmath132 .",
    "this implies a broken electron - hole symmetry , which can also be seen from fig.[a - mu ] , where the spectral function in ( a ) is symmetric with respect to @xmath95 ; while in fig.[a - mu ] ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , there are broken symmetry for electron and hole , particularly obvious for cases of ( c ) and ( d ) .    with increasing temperature",
    ", one can expect that the profile of the dot spectral function should be less and less sensitive to the variation of the lead chemical potentials , because the fermi distribution varies continuously across @xmath18 at high temperature , so do the phonon sidebands .",
    "based on the spectral function discussed above , in this section , we shall investigate the differential conductance and tunnelling current of the smt(qd ) system .",
    "the case of zero temperature will be discussed first , then follows the modifications by the finite temperature effect .      at zero temperature ,",
    "the fermi distribution functions are the step functions @xmath133 , and the coefficients @xmath67 reduce to the eq.[ln0 ] , thus the current can be expressed explicitly as    @xmath134\\left\\ { [ \\theta\\left(\\mu_l-\\omega - n\\omega_0 \\right)+\\theta\\left(\\mu_r-\\omega - n\\omega_0 \\right)]\\widetilde{a}(\\omega+n\\omega_0)\\right.\\notag\\\\ \\left.+\\left[2- \\theta\\left(\\mu_l-\\omega+n\\omega_0 \\right ) -\\theta\\left(\\mu_r-\\omega+n\\omega_0 \\right)\\right]\\widetilde{a}(\\omega - n\\omega_0)\\right\\}. \\label{j - zero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , the differential conductance can be obtained by performing @xmath137 ,    @xmath138\\notag\\\\ + \\theta(-ev_{bias}-n\\omega_0 ) \\left[\\widetilde{a}(\\mu_l)+\\widetilde{a}(\\mu_r)+\\widetilde{a}(\\mu_l+n\\omega_0)\\left.+\\widetilde{a}(\\mu_r - n\\omega_0)\\right]\\right\\}.\\label{conductance_zero_temperature}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is easy to verify that the tunnelling current and differential conductance satisfy the symmetry relations as @xmath139 and @xmath140 it is noticed that due to the equivalence between the current of electron type and hole type , the broken symmetry with respect to @xmath95 in the spectral function of smt electron is now restored for the tunnelling current and differential conductance .    ) at @xmath141 as functions of @xmath20 and @xmath19 . the parameters for calculation are taken as : @xmath88 , @xmath142 , and @xmath114 which implies that for the sake of clarity a stronger epi strength , @xmath143 , is chosen .",

    "now let us discuss the relationship between the transport properties and the smt spectral function .",
    "as mentioned above , due to the dressing effects of epi , the smt electron still has a finite probability to occupy the phonon sidebands even at zero temperature .",
    "once a phonon sideband of the smt enters the bias region , the phonon - assistant - channel would be open , as depicted in fig.[a - mu](b ) .",
    "thus the information of the smt spectral function can be inferred from the spectra of the tunnelling current or differential conductance .",
    "for example , for a fixed @xmath20 , the integral of the differential conductance over @xmath19 satisfies a sum rule , @xmath159 , which just results from the conservation of the spectral weights in eq.([sum_a ] ) . while for a fixed @xmath19 , the integral of the differential conductance over @xmath20 does not equal @xmath160 in consequence of the transfer of a finite spectral weights to those phonon sidebands , which do not participate in tunnelling .",
    "this is a little different from the tunnelling process without the epi , where the sum rule for the differential conductance always holds .",

    "compared to the zero temperature case , the differential conductance peaks at finite temperature are broadened and smeared out to some extent , and the tunnelling current profile become smoother and less sensitive to the bias , which results from the smoother fermi distributions in the leads at finite temperature .",
    "moreover , since the phonon sidebands of the spectral function will distribute more symmetrically around the zero - phonon - peak at finite temperature than the @xmath91 case as shown in fig.[a - lambda - t ] , the phonon - assisted peaks of the differential conductance might appear in the two forbidden quarters as shown in fig.[g - ef - vbias ] at @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the difference caused by the different decoupling approximations as discussed above will be diminished with increasing the temperatures .",
    "in summary , we have theoretically studied the non - equilibrium quantum transport through the single molecule transistor or quantum dot in the presence of the local electron - phonon interaction .",
    "owing to the epi , the spectral function of the dot electron will manifest itself in the phonon - dressing effects , such as the red - shift and sharpening of the zero phonon peak , and the transfer of finite spectral weights to the phonon sidebands .",
    "furthermore , due to the interplay between the epi and the dot - lead coupling , the zero - phonon band and the phonon sidebands of the spectral function at low temperature critically depend on the chemical potentials at two leads and can thus be manipulated .",
    "although the sum of the spectral weights for the @xmath102-th and @xmath85-th phonon sideband is fixed for a given temperature and epi strength , the distribution of the spectral weights is dependent on the chemical potentials in two leads , in particular on the average of two lead potentials relative to the renormalized smt level , showing the broken electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the tunnelling current and differential conductance have been analyzed at both zero and finite temperatures , which also reveal the dependence on the chemical potentials of the leads .",
    "different approximations used in decoupling the electron - phonon system have been compared and discussed .",
    "it has been found that although different decoupling approximations can yield nearly the same results at high temperature , they do lead to quite different behaviors at zero temperature .",
