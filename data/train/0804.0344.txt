    "black holes are a common feature in galaxies , spanning a huge range in mass , from the stellar - sized remnants scattered throughout the galaxy volume to the supermassive black hole often thought to lurk in the galaxy center .",
    "black holes are known to operate over at least ten orders of magnitude in luminosity , and thus experience accretion rates that range from super - eddington ( defined with respect to an associated eddington luminosity via @xmath0 , where @xmath1 ) to extreme sub - eddington .",
    "clearly the accretion rate is the overall dominating factor determining the energy output ; however , the accretion flow behavior of at least stellar mass black holes changes rather drastically between low to high accretion rates .",
    "variations include the cyclic appearance and apparent subsequent quenching of jet outflows , alterations in accretion disk characteristics , and changes in the overall radiative efficiency . for a description of the most recent observations and their implications for theoretical models of accretion flows ,",
    "see the reviews by @xcite , and references therein .    above a few percent of the eddington luminosity",
    ", for instance , accretion around black holes seems to be well - characterized by a dominant , thermally emitting `` standard thin disk '' @xcite .",
    "somewhere below this threshold there appears to be a transition to a radiatively inefficient state with some form of advective accretion and/or outflow ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although this transition has been predicted theoretically , the physical details and configurations of weakly accreting flows are still under significant debate ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular there are open questions regarding fundamental plasma characteristics such as the coupling and therefore respective temperatures of the ions and electrons , viscosity and the role of magnetic fields , the accretion flow geometry , and the relationship of the accretion flow to outflows and jet production .    for stellar mass black holes",
    ", we are learning a great deal by observing the transitions in real time between accretion states .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to track such changes directly in supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) as the relevant dynamical times scale approximately with the mass . instead , ensemble comparisons can be made with large samples of accreting smbhs that range from near - eddington down to the intrinsically weakest active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , called low - luminosity agn ( llagn ; @xcite ) .",
    "these sources are difficult to observe unless nearby , however , because of their intrinsically weak emission .",
    "given its special role as the weakest observable active nucleus , sgr a * , our galactic center smbh , has become the poster - child for a multitude of theoretical and observational studies .",
    "several extensive multiwavelength campaigns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have well established the simultaneous broadband spectrum of sgr a * , which provides a tight constraint on physical models . over the course of these campaigns , however , some very unusual flaring behavior has been discovered in sgr a * s x - ray emission .",
    "no other black hole has shown similar flaring ; however , currently we are unable to detect any other sgr a*-like objects for comparison .",
    "furthermore , the presence of jets has not been definitively confirmed or ruled out for sgr a * , complicating our ability to use it as a test source for accretion / outflow relationships at low accretion rates ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "the distinct lack of any thin accretion disk component in its spectrum also makes sgr a * unique compared to other llagn .",
    "what seems to be required is a `` bridge '' source , to help span the gap between sgr a * and other llagn in terms of accretion rate , while sharing as many other qualities as possible ( mass , spectral features , galaxy type , etc . ) .",
    "comparing sgr a * to such a source would help us determine what processes may be different or absent at the lowest accretion rates .",
    "a comparison of this type , however , would require simultaneous broadband data for the bridge source , of the quality now only associated with the galactic center campaigns .",
    "the nucleus of the nearby galaxy m81 is an ideal candidate for such an extensive multiwavelength campaign on a llagn , for the following reasons .",
    "although it is one of the intrinsically weakest llagn known , it is among the brightest because it is the nearest galaxy besides centaurus a with a central agn .",
    "furthermore it is the nearest point - like llagn , similarly inside a spiral galaxy , for which reliable measurements of the black hole mass are available .",
    "spectroscopy with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ suggests a central mass of @xmath2  @xcite , and m81 s distance is only 3.6 mpc @xcite .",
    "the nucleus , m81 * ( following the convention based on sgr a * ) , is associated with a compact radio core and exhibits both low - ionization emission line region ( liner ; @xcite ) and seyfert 1 characteristics . in terms of radiative power , probable accretion rate , and",
    "the length of the jet emanating from the core , m81 * lies in the intermediate range between radio loud agn and sgr a*.    the x - ray properties of m81 * are very typical for the llagn class ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "its nonthermal x - ray luminosity is around a few @xmath3 , though its proximity means it is still bright .",
    "similarly its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) displays no `` big blue bump '' yet does show evidence for double - peaked optical line emission @xcite , suggesting the presence of a weak accretion disk .",
    "_ hst _ observations with stis indicate that the disk is close to face - on with an inclination of 14@xmath4 @xcite .    as will be described in more detail below , m81",
    "* exhibits significant variability across its sed on both short ( daily ) and long ( monthly / yearly ) time scales .",
    "m81 * has a low absorption column @xcite , which allows uv and soft x - ray detection .",
    "perhaps most importantly for the goals of this campaign , m81 * shares several important characteristics with sgr a * , specifically its radio slope and polarization , that make it the ideal comparison source . as studies of our own galactic center have shown , detailed , multi - wavelength observations of single objects such as m81 * are indispensable tools for understanding black hole accretion .    in this paper",
    "we will present the results of a simultaneous , broadband , multiwavelength campaign on m81 * , and discuss how it compares with sgr a * , as well as its weakly accreting black hole counterparts in x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "observations specifically resulted in the first gratings - resolution x - ray spectrum of an isolated llagn nucleus , which is the focus of a companion paper @xcite .",
    "the millimeter observations carried out with the plateau de bure interferometer(pdbi ) are also presented in more detail elsewhere @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : oldobs ] we summarize the results of previous observations of m81 * and in section  [ sec : obs ] we describe our new observations and analysis .",
    "we present the resulting broadband spectra in section  [ sec : newobs ] and their interpretation in the specific context of a jet - dominated model in sections  [ sec : model ] & [ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] contains our discussion and conclusions .",
    "the m81 * nucleus has been observed extensively in many wavebands ( partly due to its proximity to supernova sn 1993j , which undergoes regular monitoring ) . in this section",
    "we will briefly summarize the previously known broadband characteristics of m81 * and discuss how they have provided the motivation for more detailed and higher resolution observations .",
    "m81 * exhibits the signature flat / inverted radio spectrum associated with the compact cores of agn .",
    "such a spectrum is well - explained by a collimated , steady jet which radiates via self - absorbed synchrotron emission along its length ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on observations from 1.422.5 ghz using the vla , several groups have observed an inverted spectrum ( @xmath50.3 , @xmath6 ) with a flux in the range of @xmath7 mjy @xcite .",
    "based on four years of observations with the vla , @xcite note that m81 * undergoes frequent radio outbursts , with the underlying flux around @xmath8mjy and higher fluxes during flares .",
    "the larger flare events occur on time scales of months , and seem to roughly correspond with predictions of simple adiabatic expansion models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the variability moves towards lower frequencies as the flare amplitude decreases .",
    "also claim they detect intraday variability at a level of 10 - 60% amplitude changes",
    ". if the longer term radio flares are indeed expanding ejecta moving out along otherwise steady jet structures , there should be even higher amplitude variations in the millimeter regime .",
    "consistent with this view , @xcite observed the 3 mm flux to double within a single day .",
    "a one - sided jet system has been resolved in m81*. @xcite identified a stationary radio core with a very small ( 700 au at 22 ghz ) , precessing ( over 20@xmath4 ) jet , the structure of which varies on relatively short timescales .",
    "interestingly , this group found no significant intraday variations over a similar time frame as the ho et al .",
    "study . investigating",
    "this question of variability was one of our campaign s goals for the lower frequencies .",
    "m81 * s radio luminosity is about four orders of magnitude brighter than sgr a * s , but its shape and polarization are quite similar . a key , and somewhat unusual , trait that these two sources share is the dominance of circular polarization up to @xmath9ghz in m81 * , and @xmath10ghz in sgr a * @xcite .",
    "sgr a * becomes increasingly linearly polarized towards its peak flux in the submm @xcite ; however , the characteristics of m81 * in the submm have not yet been determined .",
    "the interpretation of sgr a * s circular polarization is faraday depolarization by the surrounding accretion flow .",
    "if the same physics is active in m81 * , we would expect to detect linear polarization in the submm range as well .",
    "typical of llagn , m81 * lacks a bright optically thick `` standard thin disk '' component in the optical range , although double - peaked optical lines do suggest the presence of a weak disk @xcite . the low column ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ; @xcite ) allows us to detect uv and soft x - rays from the nucleus , which suggests a nearly face - on disk .",
    "@xcite used the _",
    "hst acs _ to discover variable ( by tens of % ) uv emission , consistent with the results of @xcite , who detected a weak and very steep ( @xmath13 ) uv continuum . instruments with less spatial resolution such as _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite , mirlin @xcite and isophot - s @xcite are all consistent with a steep ( @xmath14 ) non - stellar spectrum , similar to what is observed in the ir / uv in the llagn ngc  4258 @xcite .",
    "this is of interest because it suggests that in llagn , the uv is likely nonthermal emission , while the optical , and perhaps ir , contain the only potential signatures of a radiatively efficient , thin accretion disk .",
    "m81 * has a persistent nonthermal power - law flux in the x - rays , with variations of factors of 3 or more over yearly time scales .",
    "_ asca _ has detected both long term variations , as well as 2030% intraday variations which suggest that the source size is less than a few hundred gravitational radii ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "_ rosat _ also confirmed long term x - ray variability , with a factor of @xmath16 amplitude @xcite .",
    "a summary of these and more recent variability trends can be found in @xcite .",
    "m81 * s x - ray luminosity appears to vary between ( @xmath17@xmath18 ergs s@xmath19 , which corresponds to @xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "it was not until observations with _",
    "bepposax _ that more detailed statements could be made about the nuclear x - ray emission properties .",
    "@xcite observed both the short intraday as well as the long term variability over the 0.1100kev band .",
    "however , due to the poor angular resolution , they could only place a lower limit of @xmath22 of the continuum originating in the nucleus .",
    "the _ bepposax _ observations yielded several important new results which contributed to our interest in m81 * as a potential _ chandra hetgs _",
    "first , the data were consistent with no reflection component or blue bump , which would be unusual for a seyfert 1  a class of objects with which m81 * otherwise shares some qualities .",
    "the _ bepposax _",
    "results make it less likely that m81 * is a simple extension of the seyfert 1 class to low luminosity .",
    "although _ bepposax _ did not detect reflection , it did detect emission and absorption features of highly ionized iron ; however , these features were seemingly not correlated with the continuum luminosity .",
    "second , there were problems reconciling the ionization with the low inferred accretion rate .",
    "@xcite suggested that instead of ionization , there may instead be transmission through a highly photoionized medium close to the nucleus , such as a warm absorber .",
    "third , while the observed x - ray powerlaw with @xmath231.9 was typical of bright seyferts , there was no direct evidence for a thin accretion disk .",
    "a lack of a strong disk component is consistent with accretion being dominated by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) ; however , the question then arises whether such flows can account for the strong seyfert - like powerlaw over the entire 0.1 - 100kev range at the low inferred accretion rates of m81*. _ xmm - newton _ has confirmed these findings , at least in the 0.3 - 8kev band , and also detected redshifted fe k@xmath24 as well as he- and h - like ionized iron @xcite .    because _ chandra _ is the only x - ray mission with the spatial resolution to almost isolate the nucleus of m81 * ( to within @xmath25 pc of the black hole ) , determining the nature of the line emission was one of our primary goals .",
    "as described in @xcite , we indeed detect not just iron but many other low - metallicity species , as well as velocity broadening of some of these lines .",
    "the broadened line components are consistent with arising from regions close to the black hole , i.e. , @xmath26",
    ". detected line features include those associated with fluorescence from cold material ( ar k@xmath27 , si k@xmath27 , and fe k@xmath27 ) , emission lines from a hot plasma ( ne x , mg xii , si xiii ) , and absorption lines ( 18.44  and 20.74 ) that could be consistent with an outflowing wind .",
    "the plasma emission lines , specifically the si xiii triplet line strength ratios , are consistent with a collisionally ionized plasma ( although other models can not be ruled out ) .",
    "the focus of the @xcite work is on the x - ray spectra of m81 * , specifically the aforementioned line features in relation to the x - ray continuum .",
    "young et al .",
    "show that the x - ray spectra are consistent with the expectations of a somewhat simplified riaf model .",
    "we did not consider the simultaneous radio and submm data in the context of those models . in this work",
    "we now include a description of the lower frequency ( radio through sub - millimeter ) observations , and consider the entire broadband spectrum in the context of an outflow - dominated model .",
    "the difficulty in observing a source as faint as m81 * with the _ chandra hetgs _ lies in the required long integration times ( 300ksec ) to adequately resolve the narrow ( @xmath28 full width half maximum ) line features . additionally , aside from the fe features found with _",
    "bepposax _ and _ xmm _ observations ( which , due to the relatively poorer spatial resolution of these instruments , could have arisen from well outside the nucleus ) , the existence of line features from the innermost regions of llagn was uncertain . as such , at the time of our m81 * observations , no gratings observation of an llagn had been accepted in the _ chandra _ guest observer program . instead , we obtained a series of _ hetgs _ observations via the guaranteed time observation program ( pi : c. canizares ) . in order to further constrain models and better understand the variability trends of m81 * , we supplemented the _",
    "chandra _ program by proposing for simultaneous coverage with five ground - based instruments that span the lower frequencies : the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , the very large array / very large baseline array ( vla / vlba ) , the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) at iram , the sub - millimeter array ( sma ) , and lick observatory .",
    "figure  [ campoview ] gives an overview of the total campaign .",
    "for the two periods of greatest multi - wavelength overlap , figures  [ febview ] & [ julview ] give a closeup view of the coverage , and tables  [ febtimes] [ augtimes ] give the exact times in ut .",
    "in the following subsections we provide details of the individual instrument observations and data reduction .",
    "the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) is an aperture synthesis radio telescope @xcite situated 80 km north of pune in western india at latitude @xmath29 and longitude @xmath30 e. the telescope operates at 233 , 327 , 610 and 1420 mhz bands , and consists of 30 fixed position , fully steerable paraboloid dishes of diameter 45 meters .",
    "fourteen out of these 30 dishes are located within about a square kilometer of each other , the remaining 16 antennae form a `` y''-shaped array with northwest , northeast and southern arms spread over an area of 25 kilometers in diameter .",
    "the baselines in the central one square kilometer area are useful to map the extended emission of the source , whereas the wider baselines in the `` y '' provide high angular resolution .",

    "standard flagging routines of aips were used to remove the bad antennas and corrupted data .",
    "about 2530 antennae could be used in the radio interferometric setup at different observing epochs .",

    "bandwidth effects were negligible for 1420 and 610 mhz bands and we averaged 100 central channels .",
    "for the 235 mhz observations , we divided the central 5560 good channels and divided them into 4 sub - bands and stacked them together while imaging . to take care of the wide field imaging",

    "flux measurements were extracted from individual scans of 20min duration and detailed light curves were obtained that show significant variability of m81 * during the observations . if we add the systematic uncertainties with the statistical uncertainties in quadrature , the resulting overall uncertainty is around 20% ( 3 mm ) and 30% ( 1 mm ) . because the detected flux variations are likely real , and fully consistent with what is observed in other wavebands , including the systematics in this manner would seem to overestimate the actual uncertainties .",
    "for this reason we believe that taking the standard deviation of the flux is more representative of the total uncertainty in the context of this broadband system . for this reason we use the average fluxes and their standard deviations as obtained from the light curves presented in schdel et al .",

    "we then subtracted the sky background from each frame using a nearby , relatively blank field .",
    "the sky background was small compared to the bright extended emission from the galaxy .",
    "co - added images were created by shifting and adding the images from each 5-point observing pattern .",
    "the shifts between the dithered images were empirically determined between frames using the centroid of a 2-dimensional gaussian fitted to the emission from m81@xmath40 before summing the frames .",
    "frames with an average @xmath45 pixels ( 085 ) were excluded ; this cutoff value was determined empirically by plotting the peak pixel value versus the average @xmath46 for each frame .",
    "( this average @xmath46 value is from a single gaussian fit to the extended galaxy plus m81@xmath47 . )",
    "co - added images were then divided by an exposure map with the total exposure time per pixel to create fluxed images in units of counts  sec@xmath19 .",
    "each night we obtained two images of a nearby star ( gsc 0438300224 ) in order to test the stability of the point - spread function ( psf ) , and these images revealed the psf to be variable .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath44 band , the best psf image was nearly diffraction - limited with a half - width half - maximum ( hwhm ) of 017 , but the poorest on the same night had a hwhm of 025 .",
    "no other point source was detected in the 20  field of view of m81@xmath40 that would allow us to track the shape of the psf concurrent with each exposure , and we found that without empirical knowledge of the psf we were unable to construct a self - consistent model of the light from the galaxy and the active nucleus .",
    "this prevented us from obtaining accurate point - source photometry of the nucleus , and thus constraining any variability .",
    "therefore , we computed an upper limit to the @xmath44 band nuclear flux averaged over the course of the observations .    to determine the upper limit , we measured the radial profile of the psf calibration star , gsc 0438300224 , and used its 2mass @xmath43 magnitude to determine the photometric zeropoint for converting from counts to magnitudes using a large aperture ( 30 pixels = 228 ) . at radii larger than 30 pixels , the background - subtracted , enclosed counts change by @xmath48 while the noise increases",
    ". given that m81@xmath40 lies on top of strong extended emission from the galaxy , we preferred to use a smaller aperture of 10 pixels ( 076 ) with the aperture correction determined from the calibration star ; a 10-pixel radius circle encloses 79% of the counts within a 30-pixel aperture .",
    "the local background was estimated from the median in an annulus with inner radius of 30 pixels and outer radius of 40 pixels ( 304 ) and subtracted ; this likely underestimates the true local background as the extended galaxy emission is also peaked at the position of m81@xmath47 .",
    "the calibration star photometry , measured at three different airmasses ( 1.20 , 1.32 , and 1.36 ) was also used to calculate the local @xmath49-band atmospheric extinction correction . following this procedure",

    "the angular resolution of _ chandra _ , even with the insertion of the gratings , isolates x - ray emission from the central @xmath52 around m81*. we do not utilize information from the @xmath53 order ( undispersed ) spectrum , however , as the central image of the nucleus suffers from photon pileup @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _ data were filtered for times of high background and spectra were extracted using the standard ciao tools , using v3.3 of the software and caldb 3.2.2 .",

    "figure  [ alldata_nouls ] shows the broadband spectrum comprised of all of our observations from the 2005 campaign .",

    "( see @xcite for further discussions of the x - ray variability . )    the radio through submm bands revealed significantly more variability in comparison to the x - ray band .",

    "[ febpdbsma ] and @xcite ) .",
    "such a time scale would suggest that the size of the emitting region is less than 20@xmath68 , if beaming were not involved .",
    "the expected beaming from our spectral fits discussed below is mild for the weak jet in this llagn ; therefore , the mm variability still implies a relatively compact source .",
    "the sma observations were successful in the 345 ghz band only on the first observing run in february .",
    "the resulting spectrum shows a suggestive upturn towards the submm ( fig .",
    "[ radio ] , [ febfit ] ) .",
    "this steepening is similar to the spectral component seen in sgr  a * that is referred to as the `` submm bump '' . in sgr",
    "a * , this bump rapidly declines with decreasing wavelength towards the infrared ( ir ) , and furthermore it varies simultaneously with the x - rays @xcite .",
    "this simultaneous variation suggests that for sgr  a * the ir and x - ray emission both originate in regions close to the smbh .",
    "in contrast , the variability detected in m81 * is both less pronounced and not as clearly correlated between the submm and x - ray .",
    "that being said , however , the low - frequency data are suggestive of waves of variability , with decreasing amplitudes , that appear to be moving from shorter to longer wavelengths over the half year of monitoring .",
    "specifically , note that the peak at just under 10 ghz in 2005 february is gone by 2005 august , and does not appear to be associated with any lower frequency features .",
    "( the `` peak '' in the 2005 july 12 - 16 at just above 1 ghz is a mismatch between the gmrt and the vla , which may be due to real intraday variability as there was @xmath69 hours between the two observations ) .",
    "one question that arises is whether or not the doubling of flux density at 43ghz that occurs between 2005 july 13 and 19 is associated with the 2005 july 14 peak at 80.5ghz moving to lower frequency over the ensuing several days .",
    "likewise , is the 43ghz peaked bump on 19 july then seen moved to lower frequency ( 1020ghz ) and amplitude in the 2005 august 14 data ?",
    "such a `` wave of variability '' is consistent with expectations of adiabatic expansion .",
    "similarly , the february observation with contiguous pdbi and sma observations ( fig .  [ febpdbsma ] ) shows a clear dependence of variability amplitude on frequency , which is another expectation of adiabatic expansion .",
    "our new simultaneous data reinforce the similarities previously reported between m81 * and sgr a*. in fig .",
    "[ m81sgra ] we show the total m81 * campaign spectrum , including the non - simultaneous ir / o / uv data upper limits discussed in  [ subsec : uv ] , and overplot the simultaneous sgr  a * spectrum from @xcite along with the various _ chandra _ x - ray spectra @xcite . the sgr  a * data have been scaled downward by a factor of @xmath70 in order to ease visual comparison .",
    "m81 * and sgr a * show remarkable similarities in the radio frequencies .",
    "even though for m81 * , within the gmrt error bars , we see no direct evidence for the free - free absorption turnover observed in sgr a * , the slightly inverted spectra in both sources are still classic indicators of synchrotron self - absorption effects in the jet core emission .",
    "the m81 * radio spectrum lies below that of sgr  a * at higher frequencies , and thus is less inverted than that of sgr a*. this is expected for m81 * in the context of self - absorbed , accelerating jet models as its lower inclination angle compared to sgr  a * would result in a less inverted spectrum .",
    "the jets in sgr a * are presumed to be at a high inclination angle with respect to our line of sight ( see the supporting evidence from the models presented by @xcite ) . the spectra for m81 * and sgr  a * both seem to peak near the submm range and then subsequently drop off towards the ir .",
    "both sources also are consistent with sharing the same radio - ir power - law slope , if the m81 * ir upper - limits are indicative of the underlying intrinsic spectrum .",
    "m81 * and sgr  a * , however , clearly diverge from one another in the x - ray regime . on a relative scale , the m81 * x - ray spectrum always lies above that for sgr a * , with the latter source in its rare , bright flare states still falling short of the x - ray / radio flux ratio of m81*.",
    "if m81 * indeed has a `` submm bump '' as in sgr a * , this would be only the second source where such a feature is observed . in sgr",
    "a * this component has been associated alternatively with the base of a compact jet @xcite , the regions of the accretion flow closest to the black hole @xcite , or with an inner keplerian disk @xcite .",
    "regardless of the exact geometry , in sgr a * this component now has been definitively associated with x - ray flares @xcite , and thus is of significant interest for understanding high - energy processes within tens of @xmath71 of the sgr a * black hole . for the llagn class as a whole ,",
    "it is important to understand if the flaring and coupling of the submm bump / x - ray emission in sgr a * is typical .",
    "the x - rays in m81 * have yet to show any flares of significant amplitude , while we have some evidence of variability in the submm .",
    "thus in contrast to sgr  a * , the x - ray emission in m81 * may not be due to the same physical component that yields the variable submm .",
    "as further described below , this has implications for the theoretical modeling of m81*.    these results for the submm band in particular are still tentative ; more monitoring of this band as well as the millimeter range will determine whether an intrinsic submm bump is indicated .",
    "massive amounts of dust are present in the region observed in these bands and could be contributing some level of flux . on the other hand , subsequent brief observations at 345 ghz using the sma in 2005 ( a. peck , priv .",
    "comm . ) show significant variability , yielding a flux density ranging from 300 mjy to 900 mjy over a period of 3 months from april to june 2006 , consistent with the measurements made at the sma in feb 2005 .",
    "these values are accurate to within about 20% , and thus the variability is clearly significant .",
    "these further data also support a rise in flux above the millimeter band .",
    "it is possible that the submm bump is a completely transient feature associated with flaring / ejecta , as has been suggested for sgr a*. confirming this strong variability as well as a detection of linear polarization would place stringent limits on any dust contribution , as well as the spectrum . with the advent of polarimetry at 345 ghz this year on the sma ,",
    "we have ( with d. marrone , pi ) successfully proposed to search for linear polarization in m81 * , which will hopefully resolve this issue in the near future .",
    "one of the basic tenets of general relativity is that black holes are essentially self - similar with regards to mass .",
    "an obvious possible consequence of this is a predictable scaling with mass of the accretion physics around black holes .",
    "if such a scaling exists , it would imply that the same underlying physical model could explain the continuum emission for stellar accreting black holes in xrbs as well as smbhs . likely complicating this simple picture are differences that could be introduced by accretion off one star compared to accretion off the winds of entire clusters of stars .",
    "furthermore xrbs undergo state changes , which have yet to be clearly associated with the various agn classes as would be naively expected if some of the agn classes correspond to much longer lived state transitions .",
    "so far the best case for such a mapping , referred to as the `` fundamental plane of black hole accretion '' , is the correspondence in characteristics between the sub - eddington low / hard state of xrbs and llagn @xcite .",
    "the hard state of xrbs is characterized by weak accretion disk emission , and the presence of steady , compact jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these jets seem to increasingly dominate the power output of the system even as the total accretion rate decreases @xcite .",
    "lending theoretical support to the idea of a fundamental plane , models of llagn as being dominated by outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also have been quite successful at explaining the broad continuum properties of hard state xrbs ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , these outflow - dominated models have been refined further to account for strong geometrical constraints , for example , such as signatures of reflection off of cool material .",
    "the outflow models were developed to take advantage of data from recent simultaneous , multi - wavelength monitoring campaigns .",
    "statistical fitting of the simultaneous broadband continua of several hard state xrbs , including finer features such as fluorescent fe lines in their x - ray bands , have produced consistent trends among the physical parameters determined for this class of sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; maitra et al . , in prep . ) .    in order to further test the principle of black hole accretion scaling with mass , and to enable a stronger physical comparison among m81 * , sgr a * , and their possible stellar - mass equivalents , we apply these same hard state xrb outflow - dominated models to the m81 * spectra from our campaign .",
    "the only significant difference from the model application to xrbs is that the input mass for m81 * is @xmath72 times larger .",
    "a more detailed description of this model can be found in the appendix of @xcite , and references therein ; here we provide a brief summary .",
    "the model was designed to test the premise that the magnetized , outflowing compact accretion disk coronae such as described in ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can comprise the footpoints of collimated jets .",
    "although magnetic fields are assumed to play a global role , the dynamics of the model do not include magnetic acceleration .",
    "there are two primary reasons for this choice .",
    "first , because the exact role of the fields in the dynamics is still under debate , including a magnetic pressure term explicitly would add more assumptions ( and thus free parameters ) to the model .",
    "secondly , the observations suggest that the steady jets in the weakly accreting black hole state are less accelerated than the transient jets occurring near the eddington limit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the observations so far can thus be well - explained by a gas pressure dominated model .",
    "in addition , for m81 * and sgr a * in particular the inverted radio spectrum is also suggestive of adiabatic cooling in a jet with a broader opening angle ( @xmath73 ) , rather than a narrow jet as would be expected for magnetic collimation .",
    "aside from these points , there are four basic assumptions in the model : 1 ) the total power in the jets scales with the total accretion power at the innermost part of the accretion disk , @xmath74 , 2 ) the jets are freely expanding and only weakly accelerated via their own internal pressure gradients , 3 ) the jets contain cold protons which carry most of the kinetic energy , while leptons dominate the radiation , and 4 ) some or all of the originally thermally distributed particles are accelerated into a power - law which is maintained along the rest of the jet via distributed acceleration .",
    "the base of the jet consists of a small nozzle of constant radius where no bulk acceleration occurs .",
    "the nozzle absorbs our uncertainties about the exact nature of the relationship between the accretion flow and the jet , and fixes the initial value of most parameters . beyond the nozzle",
    ", the jet expands laterally with its initial proper sound speed for a relativistic electron / proton plasma , @xmath75 .",
    "the plasma is weakly accelerated by the resulting longitudinal pressure gradient force , allowing an exact solution for the velocity profile via the euler equation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a roughly logarithmic dependence of velocity upon distance from the nozzle , @xmath76 .",
    "the velocity eventually saturates at large distances at lorentz factors of @xmath772 - 3 .",
    "the size of the base of the jet , @xmath78 , is a free parameter and once fixed determines the radius as a function of distance along the jet , @xmath79 .",
    "there is no radial dependence in this model , and the opening angle is thus fixed by the velocity profile as a function of distance along the jets .",
    "the model is most sensitive to the fitted parameter @xmath80 , which acts as a normalization .",
    "it dictates the power initially divided between the particles and magnetic field at the base of the jet , and is expressed in terms of a fraction of @xmath81 . once @xmath82 and @xmath78 are specified and conservation is assumed , the macroscopic physical parameters along the jet are determined .",
    "we assume that the jet power is roughly shared between the internal and external pressures .",
    "the radiating particles enter the base of the jet where the bulk velocities are lowest , with a quasi - thermal distribution of temperature @xmath83 ( a fitted parameter ) . a significant fraction ( here fixed at 75% based on results from the xrb",
    "fits mentioned above ) of the particles are accelerated into a power - law tail at a location @xmath84 ( also a fitted parameter ) .",
    "the maximum energy the electrons can achieve is calculated explicitly by setting the local cooling and escape rates to the acceleration rate . here",
    "we assume that the particles are accelerated via the most conservative case of diffusive shock acceleration with the magnetic field parallel to the shock normal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the acceleration rate depends on the plasma parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the relative velocity of the shock to the plasma in the shock frame , and the ratio between the mean free path for scattering and the gyroradius , respectively .",
    "these terms enter into the acceleration rate as @xmath87 .",
    "this is a free parameter in our fits , and since @xmath86 is thought to lie in the range @xmath88@xmath89 , it provides a consistency check on the plasma velocities .",
    "the particles in the jet radiatively cool via adiabatic expansion , synchrotron processes , and inverse compton upscattering ; however , adiabatic expansion is assumed to dominate the observed effects of cooling . while thermal photons from the accretion disk ( via a multicolor blackbody model ) are included as seed photons in the inverse compton calculations",

    "are also included as fitted parameters , but as this component is not an integral part of the outflow model , and not well constrained by this data set , we include these parameters mainly for a consistency check .    aside from those mentioned above , the other main fitted parameters are the ratio of nozzle length to its radius , @xmath92 , and the equipartition parameter between the magnetic field and the radiating ( lepton ) particle energy densities , @xmath93 .",

    "this model has provided a very good statistical description of the broadband radio through x - ray data from several xrbs .",
    "the data from this campaign observing m81 * allows us to test the premise that sub - eddington accretion in llagn can be described by the same physics as sub - eddington accretion in low / hard state xrbs , even though the latter sources are over six orders of magnitude less massive than the former .",
    "this is the first time that our jet model has been applied to a `` canonical '' llagn , which thus allows for an interesting comparison to sgr a*.      we explore two possible jet - model scenarios with our m81 * data .",
    "the first scenario is an exact analog to the xrb fits , where the particles are presumed to enter the nozzle in a quasi - thermal distribution that is later accelerated in the jet .",
    "this scenario was also explored for sgr a * , where we determined that the acceleration must be either extremely weak or lacking , or that it must occur extremely far out in the jets , in order to prevent the presence of a predicted power - law violating the observed ir flux values @xcite .",
    "the second scenario assumes that the particles enter the jets in a full power - law distribution , as may occur if jet formation is associated with a shock in the inner regions of the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "this scenario was also explored for sgr a * , where in order to be consistent with the quiescent spectrum the acceleration must be sufficiently weak to result in an electron particle distribution power - law no harder than @xmath94 @xcite .    in exploring these models ,",
    "fits to the individual obsids for the _ chandra _ data were simultaneously carried out over the 0.57kev band for the _ meg _ data and the 0.78kev band for the _ heg _ data .",
    "each dataset was grouped to have a minimum signal - to - noise of 5 and a minimum of four wavelength channels per bin . because there are hundreds of x - ray data points compared to the radio / submm data , we initially set the radio / submm data errors to @xmath95 to `` weight '' the significance of the sparser lower - frequency data in the fitting procedure . but because the jet model produces a predominantly smooth radio spectrum ( i.e. , it does not account for the waves of variability likely moving through the radio spectrum ) , and because the radio error bars are for the most part small compared to the observation - to - observation variability , in our final joint radio / x - ray fits we add 20% error bars in quadrature to the statistical error bars for the radio data . in this manner",
    "we decrease the likelihood that the jet models fall into local minima , and ensure that they instead more fairly represent the average radio properties .",
    "we also present a series of fits wherein we simultaneously consider the radio and x - ray data from the entire campaign .",
    "we again add 20% error bars in quadrature to the statistical error bars of the radio data .",
    "for the _ chandra _ data we use the isis combine_datasets function to combine the _",
    "heg _ data into a single spectrum and to combine the",
    "_ meg _ data into a single spectrum . for each of these spectra",
    "we further group the data such that there is a minimum of 100 counts and a minimum of 32 energy channels per bin .",
    "the addition of 20% error bars to the radio and optical data acts to subsume both instrinsic variability , and allows for any systematic calibration differences among the different detectors .",
    "however , one might worry that the radio and optical data would then apply little statistical leverage on the fits .",
    "in fact , owing to the 2.5 to 9 orders of magnitude energy differences between the x - ray and uv / radio data , their effect far outweighs the simple contribution calculated to the overall @xmath96 .",
    "for example , if one pivots a power - law with @xmath97 at 1kev , the change in slope would yield well over a 20% difference in the radio regime ( i.e. , greater than our added error bars ) while giving only a 2% difference at 8kev ( i.e. , substantially less than the x - ray data bars ) .",
    "the jet models are thus predominantly constrained by the radio data via this effect , rather than their contribution to the @xmath96 statistic .    in order to illustrate this explicitly , in fig .",
    "[ radioresids ] we present the radio residuals for a fit performed solely in the x - ray regime , using jet model parameters somewhat different than the typical ( based on fitting x - ray binaries ) values discussed here .",
    "the model provides an extremely good fit to the x - ray data , with a change of @xmath98 compared to our best fit from the broadband spectrum .",
    "this model , however , fails completely in the optical and radio regime , even with our expanded radio error bars .",
    "thus the simultaneous radio / submm data especially are crucial for excluding large regions of `` reasonable '' parameter space for the jet models .",
    "the x - ray data alone simply can not constrain jet physics .    the resulting parameter differences between our canonical fits and the two fits utilizing non - simultaneous upper limits in the infra - red and optical",
    ", further emphasizes that broadening the multi - wavelength coverage is clearly very desirable .",
    "the jet model fits do present a number of `` local minima '' , which are also evidenced in the error bars for some parameter fits .",
    "occasionally we find large parameter error bars again an indication of inherent degeneracies in this complex theoretical model that we expect would be reduced with broader wavelength coverage .",
    "we also occasionally find parameter error bars that are unusually small .",
    "this is sometimes attributable to the fact that the radio data points do not represent a smoothed , averaged behavior , whereas the theoretical model does represent such an idealization to some extent .",
    "if a fit fortuitously passes almost exactly through a few radio points , the fits occasionally become very localized to that fit local minima .",
    "such a local minimum might be slightly removed from a separate local minimum associated with a different subset of the radio points .",
    "the added 20% radio error bars tends to reduce , but not entirely eliminate , this behavior of the fits .",
    "ultimately a time - dependent model is required to completely account for these effects .",
    "for the x - ray band specifically , @xcite fit a series of emission and absorption lines to the combined m81 * _ chandra _ spectra . to account for the presence of these features in the spectra , for all of our fits we added the complete set of lines from @xcite , but with there wavelengths frozen to those found in that work , and their widths frozen to @xmath99ev .",

    "compared to the the range of sgr  a * fits explored in @xcite , the fits to the m81 * spectra a similarly find a very compact jet base and an electron temperature of @xmath100 k. there are , however , significant differences which are likely influenced by the lower x - ray / radio flux ratio in sgr  a * , as well as the fact that sgr  a * , as a fraction of eddington luminosity , is over four orders of magnitude lower compared to m81*. whereas m81 * shows indications of a weak accretion disk , no such component has been observed in sgr a*. whether assumed to occur near the base , as for the power - law ( pl ) fits , or further out in the jets , as in the maxwellian ( mxw ) fits , the m81 * spectra prefer solutions with more efficient particle acceleration .",
    "that is , the electron power - law index @xmath1012.8 , whereas for sgr  a * @xmath102 is always @xmath103 .",
    "the m81 * particle distribution also shows more cooling than in sgr  a * , as indicated by the @xmath88 times smaller @xmath104 in m81*. these differences go far to explain why the weak jets of m81 * have been easier to discern than those in sgr a*. beyond the fact that we are not viewing m81 * through the galactic plane scattering screen , more particle acceleration leads to more optically thin jet emission , which in turn increases the size of the photosphere at a given frequency .",
    "thus m81 * s jets , with radiating particles accelerated into a canonical power - law , would be predicted to have a much larger photosphere at the same frequency than sgr a * s .",
    "the equipartition parameter , @xmath93 , in m81 * is very similar to the values found in xrbs , favoring mild magnetic domination of the internal energy .",
    "sgr a * on the other hand seems to be the only source we have studied so far which favors a stronger magnetic energy density ( @xmath105 ) , bucking the trend seen here in m81 * and in xrbs for a correlation between total jet power and equipartition parameter .",
    "because we have no information about the non - thermal x - ray spectrum of sgr a * in quiescence , however , this parameter may not be well constrained , but it is something to keep in mind for future explorations .",
    "the fitted jet nozzle scale height in m81 * is not well - constrained by these fits",
    ". however , the fits that include upper limits as estimates of the ir through optical spectra clearly select out a more elongated base / corona . thus to strongly constrain the value of the nozzle scale height , further simultaneous millimeter through ir / optical observations are necessary .",
    "looking at the maxwellian model fits , which have been applied to both sgr a * and hard state xrbs , we see the same trends when comparing to the sgr a * fits . for the mxw cases",
    ", we can also compare acceleration efficiency by the need for a power - law tail in the best - fit electron spectrum .",
    "both m81 * and xrbs are consistent with a high rate , here frozen to 75% , as compared to sgr  a * where only a small fraction of particles are accelerated . in sgr",
    "a * , the contribution of the tail also is minimized by acceleration occurring at quite large distances from the jet base .",
    "in contrast , the acceleration in m81 * occurs at the same location as seen in xrbs ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "in fact , even though we are probing a fairly low fractional eddington luminosity compared to the previously fit xrbs , _",
    "nearly all fitted parameters for the mxw fits to m81 * fall into the exact same ranges as those seen in hard state xrbs_. the only major parameter difference is the electron temperature , which is a factor of @xmath107 lower in xrbs .",
    "these results thus provide very strong support for the mass - scaling of accretion physics , at least for weakly accreting black holes .    by comparing the fits to individual data sets",
    ", we can look for meaningful correlations in the parameters on timescales impossible to probe in xrbs , as weeks to months in m81 * would correspond roughly to sub - second variations in a typical xrb .",
    "overall there are more obvious correlations among the mxw fit parameters than compared to the pl fit parameters .",
    "this fact leads us to consider the mxw fits as more likely probing more real physical effects . however , simultaneous constraints in the ir through uv are necessary to conclusively break this degeneracy .",
    "a selection of the strongest correlations are shown in figs .",
    "[ eddratpars ] & [ equippars ] .",
    "given the lack of simultaneous constraints on the ir through uv range , it is somewhat surprising to see some trends linking intrinsic jet parameters to the accretion disk parameters .",
    "there is a clear anti - correlation between the disk flux and the energy input to the jet .",
    "this may in fact be similar to the observed anti - correlation between soft and hard x - ray fluxes seen in hard state xrbs , such as cyg  x-1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for m81 *",
    ", the higher disk flux is driven by an increase in the fitted disk temperature , but given that we do not have simultaneous data directly in the spectral region where the disk spectrum is most prominent ( see fig .",
    "14 ) , we can not in fact be sure that the correlation is not systematic .",
    "more interesting are the correlations detected between the equipartition parameter @xmath93 and other fitted parameters . along with the total normalized power @xmath108 , @xmath93 seems to be one of the most important parameters for the jet model .",
    "because it dictates the distribution of energy between the radiating particles and the magnetic fields , it effects the synchrotron / inverse compton ratio , and can in some sense compensate for losses in the particle energy density due to , for instance , temperature decreases . as the temperature goes down ,",
    "more energy is needed is needed in the magnetic energy to maintain the same synchrotron emission , thus requiring an increase in @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , a wider jet base results in a lower particle number density and thus @xmath93 must again be increased to maintain the same radiative fluxes .",
    "the most interesting correlation , however , is that between the jet power and the equipartition .",
    "we seem to be seeing a trend towards stronger magnetic powers relative to the radiating particles with increasing total jet power . with the exception of sgr a * ( but see above for a reason to possibly discount this source in this regard ) , this trend is also seen in individual fits to hard state xrbs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; maitra et al . in prep . )",
    ". one possible interpretation of this is that the magnetic fields are more efficiently generated at higher accretion rates .",
    "after increasingly building up , an explosive release of this energy at some critical accretion rate may be responsible for driving the transient , and much more relativistic , ejecta seen in transition to the xrb hard state .",
    "our simultaneous broadband campaign on the llagn m81 * has generated five individual spectra , spread over 6 months , as well as a combined spectrum , that can be readily compared to other llagn , such as sgr a * , as well as hard - state , weakly accreting x - ray binaries .",
    "these data definitively confirm for the first time many species of line emission from the accretion flow of an llagn @xcite , and we have confirmed previous detections of variability across the entire spectrum .",
    "the radio through submm in particular shows significant levels of both intraday and longer term variability .",
    "we also see indications for adiabatically decaying `` flares '' moving out along the jets .",
    "the simultaneous , broadband nature of these data has allowed us to fit the spectra with an outflow - dominated model developed for hard state xrbs , that also has been used to understand our extremely subluminous galactic nucleus , sgr a*. we find several interesting results based on these spectral fits . compared to sgr a * , m81 *",
    "is not only much more luminous , but also more of its accretion energy is funneled into accelerating and maintaining power - law distributions of the radiating particles .",
    "otherwise , the geometry and particle thermal / minimum temperatures seem to be very consistent between these two sources .",
    "we are currently conducting a campaign of similar scope for the llagn ngc  4258 ( nowak et al .",
    ", reynolds et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , which will provide a third object to this `` sample '' of extensive , simultaneous multi - wavelength datasets for llagn .",
    "the most remarkable result of our modeling is the discovery that m81 * seems to behave just like a hard state xrb , despite it being over six orders of magnitude more massive , and accreting at a fractional eddington luminosity somewhat lower than for the jet model fits to xrbs .",
    "the best fit parameters all fall into the same range as those found for xrbs , with the exception of the particle initial temperature / minimum energy , and the nozzle length .",
    "we do not consider the latter significant , however , since it can not be well constrained by this data set .",
    "the temperature difference , on the other hand , could be more notable since it is shared with fits from other llagn @xcite .",
    "if particles in llagn enter the jets with a factor of 23 higher temperature than xrbs , this could be due to the lower cooling rates for the comparatively less compact llagn jets given the same power and size in mass - scaling units of @xmath81 and @xmath71 .",
    "our results provide an independent confirmation of the mass - scaling accretion physics suggested by the fundamental plane of black hole accretion described in   [ sec : model ] .",
    "finally , given the @xmath109 variations seen in the radio within the campaign , as well as in comparison with prior observations , and the factor of @xmath110 times smaller average x - ray flux , it is clear that the differences between average / non - simultaneous measurements and simultaneous multiwavelength observations may be quite important for llagn , and perhaps agn as well . in particular",
    "these variations becomes relevant for the fundamental plane of black hole accretion .",
    "sub - eddington accreting black holes show a correlation with slope @xmath1110.7 between the logarithms of the radio and x - ray luminosities , with an effective mass - dependent normalization . the exact values of the coefficients are important for placing stringent limits on the processes responsible for the emission . to date , the coefficients primarily have been determined from samples of agn / llagn with non - simultaneous or averaged values for the radio and x - ray luminosities .",
    "given the now confirmed significant broadband variability of m81 * , taking average values will likely lead to incorrect determinations for the correlation coefficients . to quantify this possibility , we use the quasi - simultaneously measured radio and x - ray luminosities from this campaign and redo the fundamental plane statistical analysis of @xcite .",
    "we find a difference of 8% in the radio / x - ray correlation slope , and a difference of 50% in the mass - dependence coefficient !",
    "our results therefore strongly argue for some level of care in conclusions based on non-(quasi)simultaneous observations .",
    "we acknowledge the guaranteed time program of the _ chandra observatory _ , without which we would not have had an opportunity to pursue this campaign .",
    "we also thank the staff of all participating observatories , who made these observations possible .",
