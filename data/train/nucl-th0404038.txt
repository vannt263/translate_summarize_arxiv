    "within the several last decades the deuteron- proton charge exchange reaction has been studied both from experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "a considerable interest to this reaction is connected , first of all , with an opportunity to extract some information about spin - dependent part of the elementary nucleon - nucleon charge exchange amplitudes .",
    "this idea was suggested by pomeranchuk @xcite already in 1951 , but up to now it is actual . later this supposition has been developed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown , that in the plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) the differential cross section and tensor analyzing power @xmath3 in the dp - charge exchange reaction are actually fully determined by the spin - dependent part of the elementary @xmath4 amplitudes .",
    "the analogous result was obtained in @xcite , where this process has been studied in the bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "the differential cross section of the @xmath5 reaction at 3.34 gev / c deuteron beam has been measured in 1970 s in the 1 m hydrogen bubble chamber of the jinr synchrophasatron @xcite . however , the obtained statistics is not sufficient to evaluate the magnitude of the spin - dependent part of the elementary amplitude . nowadays",
    "the experiment on the study of the dp - charge exchange reaction at the small transfer momentum in gev - region is planned at anke setup at cosy @xcite .",
    "the aim of this experiment is to provide the information about the spin - dependent np - elastic scattering amplitudes in the energy region , where the phase - shift analysis data are absent .    from our point of view , under kinematical conditions proposed in this experiment ,",
    "when momentum of the emitted neutron has the same direction and magnitude as the beam proton ( in the deuteron rest frame ) , and relative momentum of two protons is very small , the final state interaction ( fsi ) effects play very important role .",
    "the contribution of the d - wave in the dwf into differential cross section in this kinematics must be negligible @xcite .",
    "however , for the polarization observables the influence of the d - component can be significant .",
    "the goal of our paper is to study the importance of the d - wave and fsi effects under kinematical conditions of the planned experiment .",
    "we consider @xmath0 reaction in the approach , which has been used by us to describe the pd breakup process at 1 gev projectile proton energy @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the alt - grassberger - sandhas formulation of the multiple - scattering theory for the three - nucleon system .",
    "the matrix inversion method @xcite has been applied to take account of the fsi contributions . since unpolarized and polarized mode of the deuteron beam",
    "are supposed to be employed in the experiment , we also calculate both the differential cross section and a set of the polarization observables . it should be noted , in this paper we have not considered the coulomb interaction in the ( pp)-pair .",
    "this problem is nontrivial and requires a special investigation .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in sect.2 the short description of the general theoretical formalism",
    "the special kinematics , when the transfer momentum from the beam proton to neutron is close to zero , is considered in sect.3 .",
    "the results of our calculations for the differential cross section and polarization observables are presented in sect.4 .",
    "the figures in this section demonstrate the behaviour of this observables obtained in the pwia and pwia+fsi with d - wave in the dwf included and without it .",
    "the significant dependence of the calculation results on the elementary nn - amplitudes is also shown .",
    "we conclude with sect.5 .",
    "in accordance to the three - body collision theory let us write the matrix element of the deuteron proton charge exchange reaction @xmath6 in the following form @xcite @xmath7[1+t_{23}(e - e_1 )   g_{23 } ( e - e_1)]t_{12}^{sym}|1(23)>,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath8 is a free propagator for the ( 23)-subsystem and the scattering operator @xmath9 satisfies the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation with two - body force operator @xmath10 as driving term @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the total energy of the three - nucleon system @xmath13 .",
    "let us rewrite the matrix element ( [ am ] ) indicating explicitly the particle quantum numbers , @xmath14 \\omega_{23 } t^{sym}_{12 } |\\vec { p } m \\tau , \\psi _ { 1 m_d 0 0 } ( 23 ) > , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 $ ] and the the spin and isospin projections denoted as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the permutation operator for two nucleons @xmath18 was introduced here .",
    "the operator @xmath19 is symmetrized nn - operator , @xmath20t_{12}$ ] . inserting the unity",
    "@xmath21 we get the following expression for the reaction amplitude @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 the nucleon mass , and we have introduced the momentum transfer @xmath25 , relative momenta @xmath26 and @xmath27 . henceforth , all summations over dummy discrete indices are implied .    in momentum representation",
    "the dwf @xmath28 with spin projection @xmath29 is written as @xmath30 with the spherical harmonics @xmath31 and the clebsh - gordon coefficients in standard form . in our calculations , we have employed the following parameterizations of the s- and d- state wave functions @xmath32 as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then the isotopic coefficient can be calculated and eq.([1 ] ) is simplified @xmath35    the wave function of the final p - p pair @xmath36 contains the fsi part , which can be taken in different ways .",
    "in this paper we use the matrix inversion method ( mim ) suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite and applied to study the deuteron electro - disintegration @xcite and deuteron proton breakup process @xcite .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the truncated partial - wave expansion , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the maximum value of the total angular momentum in p - p partial waves and @xmath39 is the set of conserved quantum numbers .",
    "the radial functions @xmath40 are related via @xmath41 to the partial wave functions @xmath42 , which have the asymptotics of standing waves .",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 can be expressed in terms of the corresponding phase shifts and mixing parameters @xcite .    within the mim , the functions @xmath44",
    "can be represented as @xmath45 where the coefficients @xmath46 fulfill a set of linear algebraic equations approximately equivalent to the @xmath47 integral equation for the @xmath48 scattering problem . here",
    "@xmath49 is the dimension of this set , @xmath50 are the grid points associated with the gaussian nodes over the interval [ -1,1 ] and @xmath51 ( details can be found in ref .",
    "it should be noted that in this way the nucleon wave function is expressed by a series of @xmath52-functions allowing one to reduce a triple integral in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) to a double one .",
    "in addition , the method offers the opportunity to consider the nucleon wave function in the continuum directly in momentum space what simplifies all subsequent calculations .",
    "in this paper we consider the special kinematics , when transfer momentum @xmath53 is close to zero .",
    "in other words , the neutron momentum has the same value and direction as the beam proton .",
    "in fact , since the difference between proton and neutron masses and deuteron binding energy take place , the transfer momentum is not exactly zero , @xmath54 mev / c .",
    "but because of this value is very small and has no significant influence on the results , we shall suppose @xmath55 in the subsequent calculations .    under such kinematical conditions one can neglect the dependence of the high - energy nucleon - nucleon matrix @xmath56 in eq.([11 ] ) on the internal nucleon - nucleon momentum in the deuteron and express it in the center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . ) through three independent amplitudes @xmath57 where @xmath58 with the fast proton ( neutron ) momentum @xmath59 .",
    "we use some results of relativistic potential theory @xcite to relate this nn t - matrix in the c.m.s . with that in the frame of interest ( see , also @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath60 where @xmath61 is a wigner rotation operator in the spin space and @xmath62 is a four - velocity . in our kinematical situation ,",
    "when @xmath63 , each of these operators is slightly different from the unit operator , so that in a good approximation the @xmath64-matrix in the frame of interest has the same spin structure .",
    "the product of the normalization factors @xmath49 and @xmath65 and kinematical factor @xmath66 is @xmath67 in such a way , we have following relation for high - energy nn t - matrix in the different frames of reference @xmath68    to evaluate such quantities without their momentum angular decomposition we use the phenomenological model suggested by love and franey in refs . @xcite . in this approach",
    "the corresponding matrix elements are expressed through the effective nn - interaction operators sandwiched between the initial and final plane - wave states , that enables us to extend this construction to the off - shell case .",
    "obviously , such off - shell extrapolation does not change the general spin structure .    since the ( pp)-pair belongs to the isotriplet",
    ", one can anticipate that the fsi in the @xmath69 state is prevalent at comparatively small @xmath70-values .",
    "in such a way we get the following expression for amplitude of the dp charge exchange process @xmath71    one can see , we have very simple integral over angular variables @xmath72 . as the result of this integration",
    "we get following relation for @xmath73 @xmath74 note , the integral over radial variable @xmath75 also has no any difficulties , since @xmath76 contains @xmath52-functions .",
    "we define unpolarized @xmath77 cross section by the standard manner @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the square of the process amplitude averaged over all particles spin states . using the @xmath80-function to eliminate the @xmath81 integration and changing variables from @xmath82 to @xmath83 we have @xmath84",
    "taking @xmath85 this expression can be reduced to @xmath86 spin matrices @xmath87 for the proton and a set of spin operators @xmath88 for deuteron @xcite as following @xmath89 where indices @xmath90 and @xmath91 refer to the proton and deuteron polarization , respectively ; @xmath92 and @xmath93 corresponding to the unpolarized particles are the unit matrices of two and three dimensions . in such a way ,",
    "eqs.([ampl]- [ ampl2 ] ) for dp- charge exchange amplitude enables us to get the relation for any variable of this process taking into account two slow protons final state interaction in @xmath69 -state .",
    "so , we have following expression for the spin- averaged squared amplitude @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the s - component of the dwf corrected on the fsi of the ( pp)-pair .",
    "one can see , the @xmath96 is independent on the neutron and proton azimuthal angles @xmath97 and @xmath98 . to obtain eq.([sigma ] ) we have considered this fact and performed the integration over azimuthal angles .",
    "we use a right - hand coordinate system defined in accordance to the madison convention @xcite .",
    "the quantization @xmath99-axis is along the beam proton momentum @xmath100 . since the direction of @xmath101 is undefined in the collinear geometry ,",
    "we choose the @xmath102-axis normal to the beam momentum .",
    "then third axis is @xmath103 .",
    "the tensor analyzing power can be presented in the following form @xmath104 note , that only squared nucleon- nucleon spin- flip amplitudes @xmath105 and @xmath106 are in expression for the tensor analyzing power @xmath107 and differential cross section .",
    "however , the spin correlation due to vector polarization of deuteron and beam proton contains the interference terms of this amplitudes @xmath108 it is interesting , that there is the term proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath109 .",
    "it has a non - zero value only in case when fsi is taken into account .",
    "the analogous result we have obtained for the vector - tensor spin correlation @xmath110 in order to evaluate these observables we consider kinematics , when one of the slow protons is emitted along the beam direction as well as neutron , i.e. @xmath111 . under such conditions eqs . ( [ c0])-([cyxz ] ) are significantly simplified .",

    "the love and franey parametrization with a set of parameters obtained by fitting of the modern phase shift data sp00 @xcite has been employed for nn - amplitude .",
    "the full lines correspond to calculations with taking into account both the fsi in the ( pp)-pair and s- and d- waves in the deuteron .",
    "the results obtained in the pwia are shown by the dashed lines .",
    "the dash - dotted lines in the figs.(2 - 4 ) for polarization observables are the full calculation results without d - wave in the dwf . in fig.1 the full and dash - dotted lines are undistinguished .",
    "all calculations were carried out with paris nn - potential @xcite and paris dwf @xcite .",
    "one can see , the fsi contribution to the differential cross section ( fig.1 ) is significant even at the very small proton momentum , while for the polarization observables the difference between pwia and pwia+fsi is visible only for @xmath113 mev / c .",
    "however , with increase of the proton momentum up to 50 mev / c the importance of the fsi corrections to the pwia also increases .",
    "note , the absolute value of the tensor analyzing power @xmath107 ( fig.2 ) in the momentum interval of interest is near zero . in order to understand the source of that",
    ", we disregard the d - wave in the dwf .",
    "then , as a consequence from eq.([obs ] ) , the polarization observables are defined by the ratio of the nucleon - nucleon charge exchange amplitudes only @xmath114 thus , the nearness of the tensor analyzing power to zero indicates that the absolute values of the spin - flip nn - amplitudes approximately equal each other , @xmath115 .",
    "the vector - tensor spin correlation @xmath116 ( fig.4 ) has also very small value , @xmath117 .",
    "the magnitude of this observable decreases up to zero for @xmath118 mev / c , if the fsi corrections and d - wave in the deuteron are taken into account , while it is almost constant in the pwia and pwia+fsi without d - wave .",
    "one can see from eqs.([obs ] , [ w0 ] ) for @xmath116 , the reason of this behaviour is connected with the small value of the imaginary part of the nucleon - nucleon amplitudes product , @xmath119 . in such a way , the great contribution into @xmath116 gives the term proportional to @xmath120 , which defined by d - wave and imaginary part of the generalized function @xmath109 .",
    "note , that @xmath121 , if fsi taken into account .",
    "the other situation is for the vector - vector spin correlation @xmath122 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath123 gives also a considerable contribution in this observable , but it is multiplied on the @xmath124 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath122 is close to the theoretical limit -2/3 , that confirms to the conclusion about approximate equality of the nucleon - nucleon amplitudes , @xmath125 and @xmath126 . besides , this allows to conclude , that the relative phase between these amplitudes is close to zero .",
    "it is seen from eq.([w0 ] ) , where d - wave was neglected .",
    "since all the considered observables are defined by the elementary nucleon - nucleon amplitudes mostly , it is interesting to compare their behaviour for different nn - parametrization . in figs.(5 - 8 ) we present the same observables as in figs.(1 - 4 ) for two sets of parameters .",
    "the full line corresponds to the parameterization based on the modern shift analysis sp00 @xcite .",
    "the dashed line is obtained using a set of parameters for nn - amplitude from @xcite .",
    "one can see , the difference for the differential cross section ( fig.5 ) is about 1.5 - 2 times .",
    "the absolute value for the tensor analyzing power @xmath107 ( fig.6 ) with new parametrization is about 2.5 times smaller than that with parametrization @xcite .",
    "the opposite situation is for the vector - vector spin correlation @xmath122 ( fig.7 ) , where new predictions is 1.5 times lager in comparison with old parametrization of the nn - amplitude @xcite .",
    "the predictions of these two parameterizations for the vector- tensor spin correlation @xmath116 ( fig.8 ) are even in opposite sign . nevertheless , the qualitative behaviour of the curves in figs .",
    "( 6 - 8 ) for different sets of parameters is similar .",
    "we have studied the deuteron -proton charge exchange reaction at 1 gev energy in special kinematics , @xmath127 .",
    "the influence of the d - wave in the deuteron and fsi between two slow protons has been considered .",
    "it was shown , that d - wave and fsi effects are negligible for the polarization observables at the proton momentum up to 10 - 15 mev / c . as the result , in this region",
    "the polarization observables are defined by the ratio of the nucleon- nucleon charge exchange amplitudes only .",
    "however , it should not be ignored , that importance of the d - wave and , especially , fsi into polarization observables increases at @xmath128 mev / c . in such a way , we conclude , that ratio of the nucleon- nucleon charge exchange amplitudes and phase shift between their can be extracted from experimental data rather simple , if the experimental conditions and technical setup possibilities allow to work in this small momentum interval . in opposite case , this procedure is more complicated and model dependent .",
    "it should be remembered , that fsi contribution into the differential cross section is very significant in comparison with pwia predictions even at very small proton momentum .",
    "this fact does not enables us to get the absolute value of the nucleon - nucleon spin flip amplitudes without considering the fsi corrections .                                                                    *",
