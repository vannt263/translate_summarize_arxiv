    "compactifications of the heterotic string on orbifolds  @xcite yield , since the early days , a promising framework for studying phenomenological aspects of string theory , see e.g.  @xcite or  @xcite for later work and @xcite for a recent review .",
    "the world - sheet theory of strings on orbifolds is described by a combination of free conformal field theories ( cft ) and hence allows for explicit string calculations .",
    "this is in contrast to a general smooth calabi - yau ( cy ) compactification , where the world - sheet theory involves a complicated interacting cft that is often only in the supergravity limit under control .",
    "this talk reviews the results of  @xcite : the aim is to describe a new framework for phenomenologically attractive orbifolds , which in principle allows for a complete resolution ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "that is , which allows for the transition from the singular orbifold geometry to a smooth compactification by giving vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) to blow - up modes ( twisted states residing at the orbifold singularities ) .",
    "the key lies in the final step of gauge symmetry breaking from @xmath0 to @xmath3 via @xmath2 : this breaking is achieved by a freely acting wilson line ( wl ) that is associated to a freely acting involution  @xcite .",
    "it ensures that there is no flux in hypercharge direction , such that the hypercharge remains unbroken in the smooth limit .",
    "this talk focuses on the construction and geometrical interpretation of such involuted @xmath1 orbifolds .",
    "the orbifold compactification is defined by the following steps .",
    "first , we choose a six - torus that is spanned by orthogonal vectors @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "next , we identify a @xmath1 symmetry of the torus generated by two rotations with respective phases @xmath7 and @xmath8 acting on the complex coordinates @xmath9 , @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 supersymmetry is preserved in 4d . finally , the geometrical action of the orbifold is embedded into the gauge degrees of freedom in terms of shifts @xmath12 , @xmath13 and wilson lines ( wl ) @xmath14 that are chosen to be  @xcite        ( 0,0 ) for @xmath10 .",
    "part ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) illustrate different steps of the compactification ; the four / two ( colored ) fat lines parallel to @xmath16 are fixed lines of the @xmath7 sector , the ones parallel to @xmath17 belong to the @xmath8 sector and the ones parallel to @xmath18 are fixed lines of the @xmath19 sector .",
    "strings from the twisted sectors are localized on such fixed lines .",
    "( a ) depicts the fundamental domain of the torus .",
    "( b ) shows the fundamental domain of the @xmath1 orbifold , where @xmath20 has mapped the upper four boxes to the lower ones and @xmath21 has identified the two remaining boxes in the back with the ones in front resulting in one quarter of the fundamental domain of the torus .",
    "the freely acting involution @xmath22 is included as the vector pointing from the origin to the black dot . in ( c )",
    "the @xmath22-action has been divided out , reducing the fundamental domain by another factor of two and identifying two fixed lines pairwise .",
    "opposite faces of the box in ( c ) have to be identified after a @xmath23 rotation at the center of the face as exemplified by the letter r on the front and back.,title=\"fig : \" ]      ( 14256,5517)(931,-9976 ) ( 14581,-9181)(0,0)[lb ] ( 9021,-6461)(0,0)[lb ] ( 4636,-9196)(0,0)[lb ] ( 1351,-9601)(0,0)[lb ] ( 6526,-9601)(0,0)[lb ] ( 11656,-9961)(0,0)[lb ] ( 11296,-9601)(0,0)[lb ] ( 9811,-9196)(0,0)[lb ] ( 2611,-8071)(0,0)[lb ] ( 7786,-8071)(0,0)[lb ] ( 946,-5416)(0,0)[lb ] ( 6121,-5416)(0,0)[lb ] ( 12556,-8056)(0,0)[lb ] ( 10891,-5401)(0,0)[lb ]    the orthogonal torus lattice and the equality of the wls in the 2,4 and 6 direction allow for an additional orbifold identification according to the freely acting involution  @xcite @xmath24 the resulting orbifold is illustrated in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "it turns out that there is a _ freely acting wilson line _",
    "@xmath25  @xcite along the @xmath22-direction given by the vector @xmath26 which is of order 4 ( i.e. @xmath27 ) and hence stronger ( in the sense of gauge symmetry breaking ) than the original wilson lines @xmath14 , @xmath28 . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath14 are chosen such that the freely acting wl @xmath25 breaks @xmath2 down to @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , due to the additional @xmath22-direction , there are new ( massive ) winding modes with boundary conditions of the form @xmath30 entering the orbifold partition function @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , modular invariance of @xmath31 imposes the following conditions on the freely acting wilson line @xmath25 @xmath32 in addition to the usual modular invariance constraints on shifts and wilson lines , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "one might speculate that conditions similar to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : modinvz2free ] ) have to be imposed also for smooth calabi - yau compactifications with freely acting involutions , e.g.  @xcite , in order to ensure that they are genuine string compactifications .",
    "however , for the orbifold model under investigation , defined in eqns .",
    "( [ eqn : shiftsandwl ] ) , these conditions are fulfilled .",
    "the resulting model has standard model gauge group @xmath34 times a hidden sector @xmath35_\\mathrm{hid}$ ] and additional @xmath36 factors , where one of them appears anomalous .",
    "since the involution breaks @xmath2 to @xmath34 , hypercharge originates from @xmath2 and is hence anomaly - free . due to the same reason , the sm charged matter",
    "can only originate from @xmath2 representations ( being @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 in this case ) and consequently fractionally charged states are absent on the massless level  @xcite , c.f . the spectrum in table  [ tab : spectrum ] .",
    "similar to  @xcite and using the techniques described in  @xcite , a non - standard @xmath33 generator @xmath40 can be identified that arises from both @xmath41 factors and hence allows for a breaking to matter parity @xmath42 ( defined by @xmath43 ) induced by vevs of states with @xmath33 charge @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 parity violating couplings are forbidden and one can distinguish between the leptons @xmath47 and the down - type higgs doublets @xmath48 and between @xmath49 quarks and exotics @xmath50 .",
    "on the other hand dim .",
    "5 proton decay operators remain problematic .",
    "to summarize , the spectrum contains three generations of quarks and leptons , four potential higgs - pairs and some vector - like exotics , most of them in the hidden sector .",
    ".spectrum at the orbifold point .",
    "we show the representations w.r.t.@xmath51_\\mathrm{hid}$ ] and their multiplicities ( # ) and labels .",
    "the @xmath52_\\mathrm{hid}$ ] groups stem from the second @xmath41 , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath33 generator is given in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : b - l ] ) . [ cols=\">,^,<,^,>,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      driven by the fayet - iliopoulos @xmath55-term of the anomalous @xmath36 some fields need to attain vevs in order to preserve supersymmetry . due to obvious phenomenological reasons",
    "we choose them to be singlets of @xmath56 , collectively denoted by @xmath57 . following the discussion in",
    "@xcite we can construct @xmath58 solutions involving all the @xmath57 fields in terms of gauge invariant monomials @xmath59 and @xmath60 solutions by considering the number of non - trivial @xmath61-terms and non - vanishing vevs @xmath62 , being 44 for both in this example .",
    "after identifying the allowed terms in the superpotential ( see appendix b of  @xcite for details ) , one finds effective mass matrices for the @xmath63 exotics and for the higgs - pairs @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes a sum of ( known ) monomials in the vevs @xmath62 with @xmath67 being its lowest degree and @xmath68 denotes the explicit singlet label as listed in appendix a of  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , all exotic triplets decouple at linear order in the vevs .",
    "unfortunately , the same is true for the higgs - pairs in this configuration and hence one suffers under the stringy version of the @xmath69 problem .",
    "this problem can be solved in configurations with enhanced symmetries , which forbid the @xmath69 term at perturbative level  @xcite .",
    "the structure of these mass matrices reflects two interesting features : first , there is a @xmath71 symmetry of geometrical origin  @xcite ( related to the vanishing wl @xmath72 ) , where the first and the second generation form a @xmath71 doublet and the third generation a singlet , and secondly we find @xmath2 relations @xmath73 originating from the breaking of @xmath2 by the freely acting wl .",
