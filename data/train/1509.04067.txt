    "in the last decade , rapid advances have been made in the design and fabrication of two - dimensional materials  @xcite which can be used to manipulate light at small scales .",
    "@xcite the highly active field of plasmonics focuses on the interaction of electromagnetic radiation at the mid- and near - infrared spectrum with the collective motion of electrons in conducting interfaces and nanostructures .",
    "@xcite a goal is to generate electromagnetic waves that propagate with relatively small energy loss close to the interface between a conducting material , e.g. graphene , and a dielectric .",
    "@xcite in plasmonics such _ lateral waves _ should decay fast enough away from the interface ; while , on the other hand , they should attenuate slowly enough in the direction of propagation along the interface .",
    "a wave that has attracted much attention in this context is the surface plasmon - polariton ,  @xcite with a variety of reported applications  @xcite including invisibility cloaking ,  @xcite photovoltaics  @xcite and nanolithography .",
    "@xcite    most recently , direct experimental evidence was provided for generating surface plasmons by placing a receiving resonant antenna near a graphene sheet .",
    "@xcite motivated by this advance , our goal with this paper is to analytically study the generation of surface plasmons by current - carrying sources via a solvable model for a fundamental setting . to this end ,",
    "we formulate and solve exactly boundary value problems for the time - harmonic maxwell equations in the presence of vertical and horizontal electric ( hertzian ) dipoles near an isotropic and homogeneous conducting sheet between two isotropic and non - magnetic unbounded media .",
    "@xcite = -1    the underlying theme , wave propagation near boundaries , has been the subject of important studies for over a century ;  @xcite see particularly the systematic and extensive treatment of ref .  . in these works ,",
    "approximation techniques are developed for radiowave propagation ; these have offered valuable insights into the lateral electromagnetic waves traveling near the boundaries between media of very different indices of refraction .",
    "@xcite in the frequency band of plasmonics ,  @xcite however , additional considerations have emerged because of properties of novel two - dimensional materials used in microscale applications .",
    "for instance , a thin layer of graphene has a complex surface conductivity , with a positive or negative imaginary part depending on frequency and doping , and introduces a jump in the tangential component of the magnetic field across the interface .",
    "the analytical consequences of this discontinuity are largely unexplored .",
    "@xcite this view suggests that the associated lateral electromagnetic waves be studied in detail in the near- and mid - infrared spectrum.=-1    in this paper we analytically address aspects of the following question .",
    "what is the structure of the waves generated by dipole sources on a thin conducting film ?",
    "our goal is to single out fundamental attributes of the field which are intimately related to the film by analyzing a minimal solvable model .",
    "our tasks can be summarized as follows.=-1    * we explicitly represent all field components in terms of one - dimensional fourier - bessel ( sommerfeld - type ) integrals , in the spirit of ref .  .",
    "our derivations , focusing on the electromagnetic field itself , differ from the use of the ( non - physical ) hertzian potential invoked , e.g. in ref .  , by which the field components are derived via successive differentiations .",
    "= -1 * by a generalized schwinger - feynman representation for a class of integrals ,  @xcite we compute all field components via fast convergent series of known functions such as the fresnel integrals , when both the dipole and observation point lie on the plane of the film and the ambient media have equal permittivities .",
    "our model is thus simplified , yet without obscuring the goal to analytically understand the role of the interface .",
    "= -1 * in accord with applications in plasmonics ,  @xcite we further simplify the exact solutions when the surface resistivity ( inverse of conductivity ) of the thin layer is much larger in magnitude than the intrinsic impedance of the ambient space .",
    "then , a few terms are retained in the series expansions for the fields yielding simple approximate formulas for all distances from the source .    our approach is based on systematically solving maxwell s equations in the spirit of refs .  .",
    "thus , we avoid any a - priori plane - wave approximations .",
    "we recognize a specific type of lateral wave as intimately related to the surface plasmon - polariton of transverse - magnetic ( tm ) polarization of plane waves  @xcite via the contribution of a certain pole in the complex plane of the dual ( fourier ) variable ; see also the treatments of refs .  .",
    "for a horizontal dipole on a thin film in free space , when contributions related to tm polarization in principle may co - exist with contributions of transverse - electric ( te ) polarization , our analysis reveals that the tm surface plasmon - polariton , when present , is accompanied by a wave expressed by fresnel integrals .",
    "@xcite    the analysis presented here , with focus on explicit , physically transparent expressions for the electromagnetic field in terms of known functions , differs in methodology from previous studies of waves in similar settings .",
    "@xcite for example , in ref .  , the authors review dispersion relations for plane waves in plasmonics for a variety of experimentally relevant geometries , without discussing effects of point sources . in ref .",
    ", exact integrals are formulated for the hertzian potential produced by dipoles in the presence of a graphene sheet ; the electromagnetic field is then computed by numerical evaluation of integrals . in ref .  , a similar task is carried out more extensively , with numerical evidence that the surface plasmon - polariton of tm polarization , recognized as a discrete spectral contribution , may dominate wave propagation under certain conditions on the surface conductivity . in ref .",
    ", the authors numerically describe the field produced by dipoles near a graphene sheet , distinguishing a `` core region '' , where the electric field can be much larger than its values in free space , from an `` outer region '' , where the field approaches its values in free space .",
    "our work expands previous numerical approaches  @xcite in the following sense . by focusing on a simple yet nontrivial model with a conducting thin film ,",
    "we are able to derive closed - form expressions which explicitly separate the primary field of the dipole , produced in the absence of the layer , from the scattered field which is sensitive to the film conductivity , for all distances from the point source .",
    "this approach singles out analytic aspects of the wave produced by the point source that are intimately connected to the surface conductivity of the film , thus showing _ how _ the surface plasmon related to tm polarization can dominate propagation in cases of physical and practical interest .",
    "our analysis lacks generality , since we restrict attention to the case where the source and the observation point both lie on the plane of the thin film ; nonetheless , we view our treatment as a step necessary for tackling the problem of radiation by a realistic current - carrying source ( rather than an incident plane wave ) placed on the material surface .",
    "@xcite the character of the wave produced by the source of course becomes important at short distances or high enough frequencies .",
    "our work aims at illuminating the complicated structure of the field in a simple nontrivial setting .",
    "the present work illustrates analytic aspects of the tensor ( or , dyadic ) green function for the geometry of a thin conducting film at fixed frequency .",
    "naturally , the response to any imposed current - carrying source can then be derived by superposition .",
    "this task lies beyond our present scope .",
    "furthermore , we do not pursue numerical computations of the fields .",
    "the explicit computation by asymptotic methods  @xcite of field components when the observation point or the dipole is away from the layer is left for future work .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : bvp ] , we describe the boundary value problem for maxwell s equations .",
