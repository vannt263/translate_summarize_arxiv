    "if a star passes within the tidal disruption radius of a supermassive black hole , the tidal force exceeds the star s self - gravity . the star is disrupted , and about half of the stellar debris is subsequently accreted , leading to energetic flares with an integrated radiation of about 10@xmath5 erg for a solar - type star @xcite.this phenomenon is commonly known as a tidal disruption event ( tde ) .",
    "a few dozen tdes or tde candidates have been reported so far from mutli@xmath6wavelength surveys or serendipitous observations from x@xmath6rays to optical band ( e.g. , @xcite ; and see @xcite for a recent review ) .",

    "the optical light curve of ps1 - 10jh provides one of the best example for this @xcite .",
    "however , an exponential law may sometimes be described better in other cases such as asassn-14li @xcite .    in a gas - rich environment , the uv and soft x - ray continuum from tdes will ionize and heat gas surrounding the black hole , giving rise to variable high ionization emission lines . fading of strong high ionization coronal lines and brightening of [ o iii ] emission on time scales of years",

    "a detailed study of the variable uv emission , together with the optical light curve serendipitously observed by the linear survey , suggested that the transient that powered the line emission was most likely a tde @xcite .    because gas is often mixed with dust , an echo in the infrared is also expected .",
    "@xcite made a detailed calculation of the light curves at different infrared bands for a simple spherical distribution of dust within 1 pc .",

    "the reprocessed infrared emission is the convolution of the uv light curve with the transfer function , determined by the dust distribution , in the case of thermal equilibrium .",

    "note that at the epoch a1 the dust temperature is around 607 k. this means that the flux decrease of the tde component in w1 and w2 bands is a factor of 4.5 and 2.5 times larger than that in w3 band , which is roughly consistent with the estimate in the last paragraph .",
    "we found a long - term and large - amplitude decline in the mid - ir flux lasting up to 13 years after the first detection of coronal lines in four tde candidates with ecls . using a power law and/or an exponential law , we fitted the light curves and estimated the flux contributions from the host galaxies and warm dust heated by the tde flares .",
