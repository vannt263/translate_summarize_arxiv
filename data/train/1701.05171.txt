    "contextuality is a phenomenon that starkly reveals the difference between quantum and classical mechanics .",
    "indeed , kochen and specker @xcite proved that quantum mechanics is incompatible with the assumption that measurement outcomes are determined by physical properties that do not depend on the measurement context . in this sense , classical theory fails at reproducing the measurement statistics obtained from operating on certain quantum systems . the original work by kochen and specker opened the door to different formalisations of contextuality , such as the sheaf - theoretic approach pioneered by abramsky and brandenburger @xcite , the hypergraph - theoretic approach by acn , fritz , leverrier and sainz @xcite , the graph - theoretic approach of cabello , severini and winter @xcite , and spekkens work on measurement and preparation contextuality @xcite , among others .",
    "in this work we will consider the phenomenon of contextuality as defined in @xcite , where a contextuality scenario ( a.k.a .",
    "test space ) refers to a specification of a collection of measurements which says how many possible outcomes each measurement has and which measurements have which outcomes in common .",
    "this allows us to study both the jointly - measurable observables approach @xcite and the phenomenon of nonlocality @xcite in a unified manner within a general family of scenarios .",
    "a contextuality scenario is hence defined by a hypergraph .",
    "a main question in this framework is that of composition , i.e. given independent contextuality scenarios how to define the hypergraph that represents the joint state space . among the different ways of composing , we focus on those where",
    "the probabilistic models allowed in the joint hypergraph respect the no signalling principle . for the case of two scenarios , foulis and randall @xcite were the first to propose a composition rule that satisfies such properties .",
    "for multipartite scenarios , however , there is more than one way to compose the individual hypergraphs in a consistent way @xcite , which form a hierarchical family of composition methods .",
    "a curious property they have is that the set of classical and quantum probabilistic models they give rise to are independent of the choice of composition .",
    "a natural question then is whether this is a general property of probabilistic models or a particular feature of these two .",
    "on the other hand , the set of @xmath0 models has caught the attention of the community since they satisfy many quantum - like properties @xcite . here , we ask whether these models are also observationally invariant under the family of composition methods .",
    "at first we will see that they are not , by constructing a counterexample .",
    "then , we propose a variation of the family of composition rules which imposes not only no signalling but also the local orthogonality principle @xcite , and show that here the composite scenarios are observationally equivalent for @xmath0 models as well .",
    "a particular composition rule explored in this work includes the notion of completion scenario , which is in general a difficult problem to solve .",
    "here we propose a new protocol to compute the completion of a hypergraph , which builds on the ( now disproven ) conjecture of @xcite .",
    "in this section we review some basics on the hypergraph framework for contextuality @xcite .    a contextuality scenario @xcite is defined as a hypergraph @xmath1 whose vertices @xmath2 correspond to the events in the scenario , i.e. the answers of the questions that can be asked to the system in the particular experimental setup .",
    "event _ represents an outcome obtained from a device after it receives some input or `` measurement choice '' .",
    "the hyperedges @xmath3 are sets of events representing all the possible outcomes given a particular measurement choice .",
    "the hypergraph approach assumes that every such measurement set is complete , in the sense that if the measurement corresponding to @xmath4 is performed , exactly one of the outcomes corresponding to @xmath5 is obtained .",
    "note that measurement sets may have non - trivial intersection ; when an event appears in more than one hyperedge , this represents the idea that the two different operational outcomes should be thought of as equivalent .",
    "a _ probabilistic model _ on a contextuality scenario is an assignment of a number to each of the events , @xmath6 $ ] , which denotes the probability with which that event occurs when a measurement @xmath7 is performed .",
    "this definition assumes that in the set of experimental protocols we are interested in , the probability for a given outcome is independent of the measurement that is performed . since the measurements are complete , every probabilistic model @xmath8 over the contextuality scenario @xmath9 satisfies the normalisation condition @xmath10 for every @xmath3 .",
    "the set of all possible probabilistic models on a contextuality scenario is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to imposing normalisation , the hyperedges also define the notion of orthogonality ( a.k.a .",
    "exclusiveness ) among events : @xmath12 and @xmath13 are orthogonal whenever there exists a hyperedge @xmath4 that contains both .",
    "several sets of probabilistic models have been studied , depending on the nature of the system and the rule used to assign probabilities @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ ap : models ] we include the definitions of classical and quantum probabilistic models , whose",
    "corresponding sets are denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "kochen and specker @xcite showed that there exist scenarios that admit quantum models but no classical models , i.e. @xmath16 for some @xmath9 .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as _ contextuality _ , and the set of classical models is also referred to as the set of _ noncontextual models_.    in this work we primarily focus on a set of probabilistic models called @xmath17 , which is particular relaxation of the quantum set .",
    "[ q1mdef ] @xmath0 * models * @xcite + let @xmath9 be a contextuality scenario .",
    "an assignment of probabilities @xmath18 $ ] is a @xmath0 model if and only if there exists a hilbert space @xmath19 upon which live some positive - semidefinite quantum state @xmath20 and positive - semidefinite projection operators @xmath21 associated to every @xmath22 such that @xmath23 the set of all these models is denoted @xmath24 .",
    "the set of @xmath0 models is of physical importance due to its relationship to the set of  almost - quantum - correlations \" @xcite .",
    "indeed , the set of  almost - quantum - correlations \" is _ defined _ as the set of @xmath0 models when applied to specific composite contextuality scenarios @xcite ; we will comment on this connection further in next section .",
    "a natural question addressed in @xcite is , given two independent systems , how to represent such a situation as a single scenario .",
    "in other words , how two such hypergraphs combine into a joint one .",
    "a particular property that we expect of this joint scenario is that the allowed general probabilistic models @xmath25 satisfy the so called _ no - signalling _ principle ( ns ) , that is , that the single - party marginals of every probabilistic model ought to be well - defined . to make this statement more precise ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath26 the first scenario , with measurements labelled by @xmath27 and outcomes by @xmath28 , and by @xmath29 the second scenario , with measurements and outcomes labelled by @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "then , the desired property states that if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the joint scenario , @xmath34 should not depend on @xmath30 , and conversely @xmath35 should not depend on @xmath27 .    one can use elementary linear algebra to check if a candidate composite hypergraph correctly captures the no - signalling constraints .",
    "conversely , one can check if the normalization of probability along a particular hyperedge in a composite hypergraph _ follows _ from local normalization and no - signalling .",
    "a  good \" composition protocol should give rise to hypergraphs which innately imply no - signalling and normalization , and such that normalization of probability along all the composite - scenario hyperedge follows from no - signalling . in practice , this is done by expressing hypergraphs as matrices with 0/1 entries , with rows corresponding to hyperedges and columns corresponding to vertices .",
    "indeed , with a slight abuse of notation we hereafter denote the matrix representation of a hypergraph as @xmath36 , the list of hyperedges . in matrix representation ,",
    "the row corresponding to a particular hyperedge is such that a  1 \" is assigned to a column if and only if the vertex corresponding to that column belongs to that particular hyperedge .",
    "any composite scenario @xmath37 , no matter the details of the composition protocol , will have a vertex set given by @xmath38 .",
    "a general probabilistic model @xmath8 is hence allowed in the scenario @xmath9 if and only if @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a vector of all ones . a hypergraph correctly captures the desired normalization and no - signalling properties if and only if the reduced row echelon form of @xmath42  both defined below  is the same as the reduced row echelon form of the hypergraph s matrix representation .",
    "formally @xmath43 is a valid composition if and only if @xmath44    the * composite normalization matrix * @xmath45 is defined as follows . a row in @xmath45",
    "consists of 0/1 entries , such that the rows in @xmath45 are effectively hyperedges , which we denote the _ normalization hyperedges_. @xmath45 is designed to capture normalization of composite vertex sets based on normalization of the local vertex sets .",
    "a normalization hyperedge has a vertex set @xmath46 for some fixed set of local hyperedges @xmath47 .",
    "the full normalization matrix is constructed by considering every possible tuple of local hyperedges .",
    "the * composite no - signalling matrix * @xmath48 is defined as follows . a row in @xmath48",
    "consists of -1/0/+1 entries .",
    "each row in @xmath48 captures a no - signalling equality , thus that @xmath49 .",
    "given a composite scenario of @xmath50 state spaces @xmath51 , @xmath52 , a no - signalling equality is parameterized by    the choice of a local scenario @xmath53 ,    the choice of some pair of hyperedges in that scenario , @xmath54 ,    the choice of some fixed local vertices @xmath55 , one for each of the local scenarios other than @xmath53 .    given ( i ) ",
    "( iii ) , a no - signalling equality reads @xmath56 which reduces to @xmath57 for the special case of local hypergraphs with no intersecting hyperedges , as is the case of bell scenarios .    from eq .",
    ", such a no - signalling inequality translates into a row in @xmath48 as follows : any column labelled by the events @xmath58 is assigned a @xmath59 , while any column labelled by the events @xmath60 is assigned a @xmath61 .",
    "the remaining columns are assigned a @xmath62 each .",
    "the full no - signalling matrix is constructed by considering every possible choice in ( i )  ( iii ) .",
    "it is possible for two inequivalent hypergraphs to nevertheless have coinciding reduced row echelon forms of their matrix representation .",
    "whenever two hypergraphs imply precisely the same set of general probabilistic model we say that they are equivalent under * completion*. the completion of a hypergraph , which we denote with overline , is the largest collection of hyperedges - i.e. rows made up only of zeroes and ones in matrix notation - such that the reduced row echelon is preserved .",
    "formally , @xmath63 checking if a hypergraph is self - complete appears to be a difficult computational task , and the authors are not aware of any reasonable computational algorithm for constructing the completion of an incomplete hypergraph . in this work",
    "we will always refer to @xmath64 as an abstract idea , never as an explicit construction .",
    "note that a sufficient criterion for @xmath65 and @xmath66 to have the same completion is @xmath67 together with @xmath68 .",

    "to correctly capture no - signalling and normalization was elegantly solved by foulis and randall @xcite , via their foulis - randall product : @xmath69 .",
    "although we will consider of a variety of distinct protocols for composing multiple @xmath70 individual ones , it is important to note that almost .",
    "we conjecture , however , that @xmath71 , such as is locally the case for bell scenarios . ]",
    "the entire plethora of multipartite composition methods reduce to precisely the same protocol when considering @xmath72 , namely the unambiguous bipartite fr - product , whose definition is presented in appendix [ ap : prod ] .",
    "the result by foulis and randall , however , is not the ultimate answer to the problem , because the fr - product is not associative when considering more than two contextuality scenarios .",
    "different associative extensions of @xmath73 were explored in @xcite , appendix c. in this work we will comment primarily on five ( associative ) composition protocols    the _ minimal _ fr - product , denoted @xmath74 ,    the _ common _ fr - product , denoted @xmath75 ,    the _ maximal _ fr - product , denoted @xmath76 ,    the _ disjunctive _ fr - product , @xmath77 ,    and the _ completed _ fr - product , @xmath78 ,    all of which are defined in appendix [ ap : multiprod ] .",
    "each choice of product in the list above induces some hypergraph , which form a hierarchy of equivalent - under - completion hypergraphs , as proven in appendix [ ap : multiprod ] .",
    "formally , @xmath79 and at the same time @xmath80 thereby indicating the equivalence of all five composition protocols under completion .",
    "the representation of bell scenarios as contextuality scenarios depends , of course , on the choice of product , although no ambiguity arises unless the bell scenario consists of at least three parties .",
    "we will denote the hypergraph representation of a bell scenario by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the number of parties , @xmath83 the number of measurements they choose from , @xmath84 the number of outcomes those measurements have , and @xmath85 the choice of hypergraph product .",
    "as far as general models , classical models , and even quantum models are concerned , the choice or product is totally irrelevant .",
    "that is , @xmath86 pursuant to ( * ? ? ?",
    "for such models , all choices of product give rise to _ observationally _ equivalent scenarios .",
    "invariance under choice of product can not be expected for all models , however . in particular",
    ", we will show that @xmath0 models are observationally distinct for the minimal product and the common product .",
    "indeed , we explicitly confirm that @xmath87 on the other hand , we will prove that @xmath0 models are invariant relative to the choice of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , or @xmath77 , models to include @xmath88 simply by virtue of @xmath89 ( see conj .",
    "[ conj : protiscomplete ] ) . ]",
    "i.e. @xmath90    an important motivation to study @xmath0 models is that the set of @xmath0 models coincides with that of the `` almost - quantum - correlations '' @xcite for the joint scenario generated by @xmath75 , @xmath76 , or @xmath77 ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.4 ) . in section",
    "[ se : q1multi ] we will see that @xmath0 does depend on the choice of product , although in section [ se : diss ] we argue that new composition rules based on the local orthogonality principle render the joint scenarios observationally equivalent as well as far as @xmath0 models are concerned .",
    "in this section we show that the set of @xmath0 models may depend on the choice of multipartite product , i.e. the choice of composition protocol .",
    "the bipartite case is mostly ( but not entirely ) trivial , because in that case the composite hypergraphs pursuant to any protocol @xmath74 through @xmath77 all coincide .",
    "obviously , if two product choices both yield the same exact scenario , they will also yield the same set of @xmath0 models , trivially .",
    "we therefore begin by exploring the next simplest case , namely three parties .",
    "we consider those bell scenarios where each of the three parties has two disjoint dichotomic measurements , i.e. bell scenarios which are product - choice - dependent but are of the family @xmath91 .    before showing product - choice dependence , however , note that the choices of composition methods between ( and including ) the common product and the disjunctive product are _ observationally equivalent _ under the set of @xmath0 models .",
    "that is , @xmath92 holds in general , even for arbitrary individual contextuality scenarios , i.e. the invariance of @xmath0 models under such products is not limited to bell scenario .",
    "the proof is as follows : @xmath0 models are charecterized entirely by the orthogonality graph associated with a given contextuality scenario @xcite .",
    "different contextuality scenarios , i.e. different hypergraphs , can have the same associated orthogonality graph .",
    "the orthogonality graph is computed by a hypergraph as follows : every node in the hypergraph is a node in the orthogonality graph , and two vertices are adjacent in the orthogonality graph if and only if both vertices appear in a common hyperedge in the hypergraph . per @xcite , @xmath0 models can be characterised via the weighted lovasz number of the _ _ non__orthogonality graph .",
    "note now that all composition methods between the common product and the disjunctive product yield the same orthogonality graph , namely the orthogonality graph that follows from the principle of local orthogonality @xcite , as discussed in appendix [ ap : multiprod ] .",
    "given that , it follows that all such composition methods allow precisely the same set of @xmath0 models .    to positively illustrate nontrivial product - choice dependence for @xmath0 models we therefore focus our efforts on finding a difference between the minimal product @xmath93 and the common product @xmath94 .",
    "firstly note that , regardless of the choice of product , @xmath91 has 64 vertices , which correspond to the eight different possible joint - measurement outcomes for each of the eight different possible ( fixed ) multipartite measurement contexts .",
    "the different product choices nevertheless lead to distinct hypergraphs :    @xmath95 has * 176 * hyperedges ,    @xmath96 has * 488 * ,    @xmath97 has * 680 * ,    @xmath98 has * 744*.    lacking a constructive protocol to generate the completion , the authors can not be sure how many hyperedges the completion has , although we conjecture that    [ conj : protiscomplete ] @xmath99 .",
    "+ in other words , the disjunctive protocol is conjectured be self - complete whenever the local hypergraphs satisfy the property of orthogonality - graph - invariance - under - completion .",
    "if true , the conjecture would imply that @xmath100 .",
    "as an aside , the very fact that @xmath101 shows that conj .",
    "c.2.6 in ref .",
    "@xcite is false .",
    "all four explicitly - constructed hypergraphs @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 have 64 vertices . since we always have a hierarchy of hypergraphs per eq .",
    "( [ eq : hierarchy ] ) , we also always have a hierarchy of allowed probabilistic models , namely @xmath102 .",
    "our first novel result is that @xmath103 allows strictly more @xmath0 models than the other composition protocols .",
    "this can be witnessed by computing the maximization of the guess your - neighbours - input linear function @xcite by @xmath0 models in the different composite scenarios .",
    "while the supremum of this linear function is unity in @xmath104 , we found that in @xmath105 the linear function could be maximized all the way to @xmath106 .",
    "we also probed additional bell inequalities , i.e. maximizing different linear functions under both @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and we frequently witnessed a similar gap between the two maxima .",
    "the results are tabulated in appendix [ ap : sliwa ] .",
    "this case study shows that sometimes @xmath107 , because in our example @xmath105 was found to be strictly larger than @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is the completion of @xmath105 .",
    "we should intuit that this is the case in general , namely we expect the following fairly - strong conjecture to be true :    @xmath110 whenever @xmath111 , even if @xmath112 .",
    "in other words , two contextuality scenario should admit different @xmath0 models if the two scenario do not have the same associated orthogonality graph , even if the two scenarios are equivalent under completion .",
    "evidence for this conjecture is presented in in appendix [ ap : q1comp ] , where we contrast a contextuality scenario consisting of @xmath113 hyperedges with its completion , which has @xmath114 hyperedges , such that the two hypergraphs have different orthogonality graphs .",
    "we show that for the bell inequality , correlations in @xmath115 achieve a maximum value of @xmath116 , whereas those in @xmath17 reach @xmath117 .",
    "in the previous section we have noted that although different composition methods are observationally equivalent as far as classical , quantum , and general probabilistic models are concerned , nevertheless @xmath0 probabilistic models are _ not _ observationally invariant between some of these compositions .",
    "we now discuss how the dependence of @xmath0 models on the choice of composition rule is related to the local orthogonality principle @xcite .    in the hypergraph formalism @xcite , two events @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "are _ orthogonal _",
    "( a.k.a _ exclusive _ ) whenever there exists a hyperedge @xmath118 that contains both vertices , i.e. @xmath119 .",
    "now , consider a composite contextuality scenario @xmath120 , where , for the moment , we have not specified the particular way of composing the individual scenarios @xmath53 , @xmath121 .",
    "given two events in the composite scenario @xmath122 a natural question is to ask if the pair of ( composite ) events are orthogonal . per the standard defiinition of orthogonality ,",
    "the orthogonality of compositive events depends entirely on the particular hyperedge set of @xmath120 . from an operational perspective , however , one would also expect two events to be orthogonal whenever they are _ locally orthogonal _ ( lo ) @xcite .",
    "local orthogonality specifies the orthogonality of composite events in the following fashion : let @xmath123 and @xmath124 be two events in the joint scenario , labelled by the events in the individual ones .",
    "then , if there exists a party @xmath125 such that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are orthogonal in their individual contextuality scenario , then the two events @xmath12 and @xmath13 should be regarded as orthogonal in the joint scenario as well .",
    "note that whenever the composite scenario @xmath120 has a hyperedge set subsuming the common product , i.e. @xmath128 , then lo is automatically imposed by the standard definition of exclusivity .",
    "therefore , imposing the lo principle neither changes the orthogonality graph nor the set of allowed @xmath0 models . on the other hand",
    ", however , the composite scenario that arises from the minimal fr product does _ not _ automatically impose lo .",
    "therefore , one possibility is to equip the compositions rules of a product with constraints that impose lo _ ad - hoc_. the joint scenario that arises from such an ad - hoc - modified composition method has the following property by construction : it gives rise to the same the orthogonality graph as would @xmath75 .",
    "we find that by manually supplementing the composition rules so as to satisfy lo , the apparent observational inequivalence of @xmath0 models of under @xmath74 and @xmath75 disappears , such that rather @xmath129 .",
    "the work of @xcite focused on products where the composite scenario allows for probabilistic models that respect the no - signalling principle .",
    "here we argue that , in addition , one should ask the composition rule to include the orthogonality relations that arise from the local orthogonality principle . the ideal composition rule ,",
    "therefore , should naturally impose local orthogonality relations in addition to the obvious prerequisites of normalization and no - signalling .",
    "we know of three possible constructive composition rules which meet these requirements , as well as associativity : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .    per conj .",
    "[ conj : protiscomplete ] , we have speculated that the completion of _ any _ composition product  which are all known to have the same completion  is equal to precisely @xmath77 , at least whenever the local contextuality scenarios are themselves complete . in other words , @xmath130 .",
    "bell scenarios fall into this class , i.e. the contextuality scenario of each individual party is complete .",
    "if self - completeness is a desired feature in a composition rule , this suggests the disjunctive protocol as an ideal candidate .",
    "if , however , minimality by hyperedge count is prioritized over self - completeness , then we are led to unambigously endorse the common fr product as the ideal associative protocol which innately satisfies local orthogonality in addition to correctly capturing no - signalling and normalization .",
    "in this work we explore different ways to compose multipartite contextuality scenarios , and the sets of correlations allowed by the different composition rules .",
    "classical , quantum and general probabilistic models are invariant under the choice of composition rule , but we have seen that this invariance does not extend to all other sets of models , as illustrated by @xmath0 models behaving different under @xmath74 than under @xmath75 .",
    "such dependence on product choise disappears , however , as soon as we equip the composite scenarios with additional constraints , namely the orthogonality relations implied by the local orthogonality principle .",
    "this not only highlights the importance of lo , but arguably suggests a more correct way to define the composition of multipartite contextuality scenarios .",

    "this is a consequence of the fact that every hyperedge in the maximal fr product is a unextendable clique of locally orthogonal events .",
    "those cliques form a subset of those which are admitted into the disjunctive fr product , by virtue of definition [ def : disj]a .",
    "this also implies that the rank of the matrix representation of the disjunctive fr product is at least as large as that of the maximal fr product . to prove now that the disjuctive fr product has the same completion as the maximal fr product , we need to show the converse , i.e. @xmath209 .",
