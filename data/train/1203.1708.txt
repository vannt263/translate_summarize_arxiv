    "rutherford explained his scattering results as the passage of a high speed electron through an atom having a positive central charge @xmath4 , and surrounded by a compensating charge of @xmath5 electrons @xcite . in rutherford s model",
    "the atom is nearly empty , it is made up of a central charge and electrons and the glue keeping the system together are the coulomb forces . today we denote the positive central charge as the atomic nucleus , though rutherford did not use the term `` nucleus '' in his paper .",
    "the central point charge is surround by a cloud of point electrons orbiting around the nucleus . the first quantum - mechanical treatment of the rutherford model",
    "was given in 1913 by bohr . according to the bohr theory",
    "the energies and radii of the orbits are ( in gaussian units ) @xmath6 here and in the following we denote the so - called main quantum number by @xmath7 in order not to be mixed with the density @xmath8 . according to the bohr model there are infinitely many levels close to the series limit @xmath9 .",
    "a first statistical theory of the bohr model was developed already in 1913 by the austrian physicist karl herzfeld @xcite .",
    "herzfeld detected that the bohr model had a serious deficiency , the internal atomic partition function @xmath10 is divergent ( @xmath11 : ionization energy ) .",

    "a theory was required which provides the abundancies of atomic energy levels in stars .",
    "such a theory was created on the basis of the rutherford - bohr model by the work of eggert and saha around 1920 .",
    "their work is an application of thermodynamics to the rutherford - bohr model , which was inspired by the papers of the nernst school .",
    "the ionization problem was studied within the chemical picture and using sackur s and tetrode s statistical expression for the entropy of gases .",
    "eggert published a first approach in 1919 @xcite , his paper came to the attention of the young bengalic physicist saha , who succeeded to improve the approach considerably @xcite .",
    "saha considers , in the paper from 1921 , calcium plasmas as an example . formulating his equation for hydrogen",

    "the region were bound states may exist is shown in fig . [ zustandssumme ] .",
    "eggert and saha used the thermodynamic approach of sackur and tetrode which needs only the binding energy , avoiding this way the problem of divergence of the partition function . for more accurate treatment of astrophysical tasks",

    "the easiest way is to cut the sum at the lowest terms corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "this way of solving the divergence problem is due to the classical paper of planck published in 1924 @xcite , later in 1938 applied to special plasma problems by riewe and rompe @xcite . developing plancks approach brillouin proposed in 1932 a more smooth way of removing the divergence which led to the formula @xmath23 .",

    "we concentrate on the so - called physical picture which stays within the rutherford picture and avoids the introduction of chemical species like atoms , molecules etc .",
    "we note that in some earlier work the saha theory has been proven to become asymptotically exact in zero - temperature _ and _ zero - density limit @xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves mainly to a region of practical interest , i.e. , to temperatures between @xmath0 k and @xmath1 k and particle densities between @xmath26 and @xmath2 per @xmath27 . in some of our",
    "earlier work the transition to a chemical picture was made following the principle of equivalence that bound states are to be treated on the same footing as free particles @xcite .",
    "this approach was quite successful in the description of partial ionization @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one has to accept that in the region of high densities several serious difficulties appear which are mainly connected with the impossibility of a clear distinction between free and bound states in a dense system @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why we stay here within the physical picture taking into account the important higher order terms @xcite . in a similar spirit , but using different techniques , a consistent treatment of bound state contributions within the physical picture has been constructed already by alastuey et al .",
    "we show here first a treatment of the coulomb singularities in the framework of the virial expansions within the canonical ensemble , then we discuss the fugacity expansions and identify the higher order contributions which allow a saha - type approximation . in the last part we investigate the role of the identity of electrons within the grand canonical ensemble .    in the first part of this work we will to show that the brillouin - planck - larkin procedure provides the most natural way to avoid the divergencies for non - degenerate systems . in the last part we study degenerate systems and show that a consequent treatment of the identity of electrons in the hartree - fock approximation including bound states is a key for the treatment of hydrogenic bound states .",
    "the present approach is based on the method of green s functions as developed in @xcite .",
    "any successful description of plasmas has to go beyond the saha theory which is something like the lowest density order approximation for plasmas .",
    "this way our strategy should be to obtain first an approximation equivalent to the saha description and then to go further .",
    "the derivation of saha - type approximations from quantum statistics was first studied by planck , fowler and brillouin @xcite .",
    "since then it is a topic of permanent interest due to the importance of saha - type equations for experimental work and for many technological applications .",
    "a first big progress in the strict quantum statistical treatment was achieved in the 60th by papers of montroll , ward , vedenov , larkin , abrikosov and others @xcite and in subsequent work @xcite .",
    "we note that a consistent description of bound states in macroscopic physical systems is a hot problem of modern quantum statistics and was treated also independently and using different techniques by other workers @xcite .",
    "planck s work was inspired by the earlier papers of eggert and saha that was an application of thermodynamics and sackur s and tetrode s expression for the entropy .",
    "accordingly eggert and saha needed only the binding energy , avoiding this way the problem of divergence of the partition function . in his annalen paper from 1924 , max planck uses a more consequent statistical approach based on the partition function .",
    "he splits first the atomic partition function into three contributions @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the contribution of the lowest bound states @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the contribution of the bound states below the series limit and @xmath32 is the entire remainder .",
    "using a rather complicated quasiclassical derivation planck was able to show that due to compensation effects it holds @xmath33 in other words the sum of the second and the third contributions reduces to the partition function of an ideal gas , i.e. the all diverging contributions cancel each other .",
    "planck s paper was considered in those years to be very important , so it was discussed in some detail in several textbooks and monographs , e.g. in the books written by brillouin @xcite and fowler @xcite .",
    "we follow here mostly brillouin .",
    "according to brillouin @xcite , the cancellation effect found by planck is exactly true only if one makes the particular choice @xmath34 as the derivations of planck , fowler and brillouin are very difficult to understand we give the proof of planck s important statement in a more easy version which however uses the same physical assumptions @xcite .",
    "we start with planck s final expression @xmath35 + \\alpha [ \\ln ( n \\lambda_i^3 \\alpha)+1]\\nonumber\\\\ + ( 1-\\alpha ) [ \\ln ( n \\lambda_a^3 ( 1 - \\alpha ) ) - \\ln ( \\sigma_3(t ) ) + 1 ] ] + f_{\\rm ex}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath36 is the excess part of the free energy .",
    "planck and brillouin claim that this contribution is zero , @xmath37 ; however these researchers did not include screening , an effect detected nearly at the same time by debye . in the following part of this section we repeat the derivation of the excess part but include also the contributions from screening effects using a semiclassical screened cluster expansion approach @xcite . in order to find the excess free energy of a plasma we have to calculate all contributions beyond the the ideal contributions of electrons , protons and atoms .",

    "up to the debye contribution , which was not yet known to planck , since is was just in print when planck wrote his paper , this is just what planck and brillouin calculated .",
    "after tedious calculations one can show analytically with a numerical check @xcite , that the sum of the integrals beyond the debye term cancel each other and gives zero .",
    "@xmath41.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the excess free energy consists in the given quasiclassical approximation only of the debye term and some higher order corrections . in particular , there is no contribution in the quadratic order . this way we could justify the remarkable result of planck and brillouin",

    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "a typical picture of the pressure in the saha approach shows that bound states exist only in certain valley in the density - temperature plane , see fig .",
    "[ zustandssumme ] .",
    "we will see later that the bound state contributions as well as the debye contributions are responsible for a reduction of the pressure in comparison to the ideal pressure ( see fig .",
    "[ presse ] ) . the saha equation and the corresponding pressure do not describe the region of high densities , the debye term yields just a first correction . at higher densities",
    "another important influence is due to the fermi pressure in the region of electron degeneracy . in order to check for the influence of electron degeneracy we compare with the ideal gas pressure including the fermi pressure of the electrons : @xmath44 ; \\,\\",

    "this demonstrates that the region of bound state formation where the pressure is significantly smaller than the ideal pressure of an electron - proton gas is a limited region in the density - temperature plane ( the valley of bound states ) .",
    "the main task of this work is the study of the two transitions : + ( i ) the formation of bound states occurring at the cross - over from fully ionization to the region were bound states are formed ( we have partial ionization ) observed with increasing density , + ( ii ) the destruction of bound states beyond the valley of bound states in the high density region .",
    "the region of our interest in the density - temperature plane where bound states appear is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ zustandssumme ] .",
    "we determine here the first transition by the densities where @xmath45 decreases below the value @xmath46 and identify the second transition by the condition that @xmath47 exceeds the value @xmath48 , that means the fermi pressure @xmath49 gives the overall dominant contribution . from the physical point of view",
    "we should expect that the real pressure should be nearer to the highest contribution , i.e at lower densities nearer to the pressure given by the saha equation and at high densities nearer to the fermi pressure .",
    "later we will confirm the result that bound states occur only on an island in the @xmath50 plane .",
    "in our primitive extended saha model , the formation of atoms is described by the mass action law which is part of the saha model and the destruction at high density is described in a very rough approximation only by the strong increase of the ideal fermi pressure . in the following sections we will show how these effects are more correctly described by methods of quantum statistics .",

    "[ zustandssumme ] first a horizontal line corresponding to the density of @xmath51 @xmath3 .",
    "for such a density the the mean distance between protons ( or electrons ) defined by @xmath52 is around the bohr diameter . @xmath53 for larger densities ( smaller average distances ) the formation of bound states may be excluded , the plasma behaves nearly as an ideal fermi gas since there is not enough space for forming atomic orbitals or molecular orbitals .",
    "the disappearance of bound states is referred to as mott condition , corresponding to the fact that atoms are destroyed if the mean distance of the electrons is much smaller than the bohr radius .",
    "such situation was discussed in @xcite . for more detailed information",
