    "[ fig : susc.fit ] the `` experimental '' susceptibility is analyzed by the susceptiblity of static spin models , i.e.  the isotropic heisenberg model ( hm ) , the purely frustrated spin chain and the dimerized and frustrated chain . obviously , the hm is not appropriate to describe the data depicted by the symbols .",
    "but the other two parameter sets ( @xmath112 ) and ( @xmath113 ) describe the experimental data very well for not too low temperatures , i.e.   @xmath114 .",
    "this temperature regime corresponds to the the range of temperatures where the extrapolated high - temperature series for the dimerized and frustrated spin chain are reliable @xcite .    of course , it is possible to distinguish between different models if reliable ( experimental ) data down to low temperatures are available . in practice , however , this is often not the case since the data at low temperatures can be contaminated by impurity effects or other imperfections like inclusions of other phases or simply the presence of other structural elements in the sample . in such a situation ,",
    "the determination of the appropriate microscopic model is difficult and ambiguities are hard to avoid .    one way to make progress is to use the parameter set determined from the susceptibility data and to examine whether other properties can be understood with the same parameter set as well .",
    "here we choose to study the specific heat . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec.susc.fit ] the phonon frequencies are assumed to be known a priori ; so the free phonon contribution added is the one for this known frequency @xmath115 .",
    "clearly , none of the static spin models describes the susceptibility data _ and _ the specific data satisfactorily . from the knowledge of both quantities compelling evidence",
    "can be deduced that a dynamic spin - phonon coupling must be present .    .",
    "for the upper plot the phonon frequency is assumed to be known beforehand .",
    "for the lower plot no a priori knowledge is assumed for the phonon frequency ; so it is also fitted .",
    "the line styles are the same as those used in fig .",
    "[ fig : susc.fit ] , that means the exchange couplings used are those from the corresponding curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : susc.fit].,title=\"fig : \" ] + . for the upper plot the phonon frequency",
    "is assumed to be known beforehand .",
    "for the lower plot no a priori knowledge is assumed for the phonon frequency ; so it is also fitted .",
    "the line styles are the same as those used in fig .",
    "[ fig : susc.fit ] , that means the exchange couplings used are those from the corresponding curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : susc.fit].,title=\"fig : \" ]    but the situation can be less advantageous in practice .",
    "let us assume that we do not possess knowledge about the frequency of the phonon to which the spin system may or may not be coupled .",
    "then this frequency could be seen as an additional fit parameter .",
    "this view point was adopted in the lower plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec.susc.fit ] . the parameter set ( @xmath116 ) of the dashed - dotted curve can be clearly discarded .",
    "the parameter set ( @xmath117 , the heisenberg model hm ) of the solid curve can be discarded because it does not describe the susceptibility , cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : susc.fit ] . the parameter set ( @xmath118 ) of the dashed curve seems to fit the data down to @xmath119 . for lower values , however , the agreement is poor .",
    "so also this data set must be discarded .",
    "note that we refer only to the temperature regime where the extrapolated series yield reliable results .",
    "so we have shown for the above example that it is _ not _ possible to describe the data of a dynamic spin - phonon system in the intermediate regime , where all energy scales are of similar magnitude , in the framework of static spin models plus ( decoupled ) phonons .",
    "but it is not sufficient to consider only one quantity at ( relatively ) high temperatures . in order to obtain unambiguous evidence of the presence of a dynamic spin - phonon coupling one",
    "has to dispose of either data down to low temperatures ( not considered here ) or to consider at least two independent thermodynamic quantities . otherwise , one may easily be misled by a good agreement in one quantity alone to conclude that a simpler static model is sufficient for a microscopic description .",
    "the problem of a one - dimensional spin system coupled to phononic degrees of freedom is investigated .",
    "a cluster expansion is applied to obtain a series expansion in the magnetic coupling @xmath1 .",
    "results are computed at finite temperatures for the free energy , the specific heat , and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "no truncation in the phononic subspace is necessary since the expansion is performed in @xmath1 about the limit @xmath25 , not in the inverse temperature .",
    "this is the first realization of a cluster expansion at finite temperatures for an extended spin - phonon problem .",
    "the implementation of the expansion in a computer program yields high orders in the expansion parameter .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained from the extrapolated series to data from quantum monte - carlo simulations shows a very good agreement .",
    "this supports the reliability of the approach .",
    "hence our results can serve as input for quantitative data analysis since the features of the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat at moderate and at high temperatures @xmath120 are described reliably .",
    "a possible route to improve the extrapolations is to understand the limit @xmath97 in the hamilton operator ( [ eqn : hamilton ] ) better . at first glance",
    ", this limit looks simple since it corresponds to the adiabatic situation with @xmath121 . but this limit is not straightforward since the nature of the excitations is unclear at present . note that in this limit static displacements can be made at no energetic cost .",
    "this suggests that the excitations are domain walls .",
    "whether these objects are static ( because @xmath122 ) or dynamic ( because the magnetic subsystems retains its fluctuations ) is unclear at present and constitutes an interesting theoretical issue in itself .",
    "finally , we analyzed the data of a spin - phonon system in the intermediate coupling regime , where all energies are of similar magnitude , in great detail .",
    "as expected , we could show that the effects of the dynamic spin - phonon coupling can not be imitated by a static spin model and decoupled phonons .",
    "but it is necessary to study low temperatures or at least two quantities like the susceptibility and the specific heat carefully .",
    "otherwise , one may be easily misled by a good agreement in one quantity alone to conclude that a static microscopic model is sufficient .",
    "we think that this conclusion is helpful for future experimental analyses of low - dimensional spin systems .",
