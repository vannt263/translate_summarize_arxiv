    "analysis of the deep inelastic scattering structure functions in the limit of small values of the bjorken parameter @xmath0 allows to test perturbative qcd in a new and hitherto unexplored regime @xcite .",
    "the advent of the hera @xmath4 collider has opened up an experimental possibility to confront the theoretical qcd expectations with the experimental data on deep inelastic scattering in the small @xmath0 region .",
    "the relevant theoretical framework is provided in this case by the balitzkij , fadin , kuraev , lipatov ( bfkl ) equation for the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the transverse momentum of the gluon and @xmath0 its longitudinal momentum fraction @xcite .",
    "this equation sums the leading powers of @xmath7 at each order of the perturbative expansion i.e. it corresponds to the leading @xmath7 approximation .",
    "the small @xmath0 behaviour of the structure functions is driven by the gluon through the @xmath8 transitions @xcite .",
    "+ perturbative qcd predicts a strong increase of structure functions with the decreasing parameter @xmath0 and the experimental data from hera are consistent with this prediction @xcite .",
    "this increase is much stronger than that which would follow from the expectations based on the `` soft '' pomeron exchange mechanism with the soft pomeron intercept @xmath9 as determined from the phenomenological analysis of total hadronic and real photoproduction cross - sections @xcite .",
    "+ the small @xmath0 behaviour of structure functions for fixed @xmath10 reflects the high energy behaviour of the virtual compton scattering total cross - section with increasing total cm energy squared @xmath11 since @xmath12 . the regge pole exchange picture @xcite is therefore quite appropriate for the theoretical description of this behaviour .",
    "the high energy behaviour which follows from perturbative qcd is often refered to as being related to the `` hard '' pomeron in contrast to the soft pomeron describing the high energy behaviour of hadronic and photoproduction cross - sections .",
    "+ the pomeron does not contribute to the spin dependent structure function @xmath2 which is controlled by the exchange of reggeons corresponding to axial vector mesons @xcite .",
    "the pomeron also decouples , of course , from the `` non - singlet '' part of the unpolarized structure functions i.e.from the combination @xmath13 which at small @xmath0 is controlled by the @xmath14 reggeon exchange .",
    "the small @xmath0 behaviour of the structure function @xmath2 in perturbative qcd is sensitive to a new class of double logarithmic @xmath7 contributions i.e. to the terms which contain powers of @xmath15 in the perturbative expansion @xcite .",
    "these terms invalidate naive regge pole model expectations and generate the singular small @xmath0 behaviour of the structure function @xmath2 .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to briefly summarize some of the qcd expectations concerning the small @xmath0 behaviour of the unpolarized and polarized structure functions of the nucleon . in the next section we recall the regge pole model expectations for the small @xmath0 behaviour of both the polarized and unpolarized structure functions while section 3 is devoted to the discussion of the bfkl equation @xcite and its generalization based on angular ordering , i.e. the catani , ciafaloni , fiorani and marchesini ( ccfm ) equation @xcite . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss the small @xmath0 behaviour of the polarized structure function @xmath2 concentrating for simplicity on its non - singlet part .",
    "we recall the ( approximate ) integral equation which resums the double logarithmic terms and discuss its solution after taking into account the running coupling effects .",
    "we present an estimate of the effective slope @xmath16 controlling the small @xmath0 behaviour of the spin - dependent structure function @xmath17 .",
    "5 will contain our main conclusions .",
    "the regge pole model describes the high energy behaviour of scattering amplitudes in terms of the exchange of reggeons which correspond to poles in the complex angular momentum plane in the crossed channel @xcite .",
    "the total cross - sections are related through the optical theorem to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitudes in forward direction ( i.e. for @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the momentum transfer squared ) .",
    "the regge pole model description of the scattering amplitudes when combined with the optical theorem gives therefore automatically predictions for the high energy behaviour of the total cross - sections : @xmath20 the quantities @xmath21 are the intercepts of the regge trajectories and @xmath22 denote the couplings .",
    "+ the regge pole exchange is to a large extent a generalization of the single particle exchange and so the reggeons carry the same quantum numbers as hadrons which particular regge pole trajectories correspond to .",
    "there is an obvious hierarchy of regge pole contributions depending upon the magnitude of their intercept .",
    "the contribution with highest intercept corresponds to pomeron which carries vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "+ the high energy behaviour of the total hadronic and ( real ) photoproduction cross - sections can be economically described by two contributions : an ( effective ) pomeron with its intercept slightly above unity ( @xmath23 ) and the leading meson regge trajectories with intercept @xmath24 @xcite . the reggeons can be identified as corresponding to @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath14 exchange(s ) depending upon the quantum numbers involved .",
    "all these reggeons have approximately the same intercept .",
    "one refers to the pomeron obtained from the phenomenological analysis of hadronic total cross sections as the `` soft '' pomeron since the bulk of the processes building - up the cross sections are low @xmath27 ( soft ) processes .",
    "+ the regge pole model gives the following parametrization of the deep inelastic scattering structure function @xmath28 at small @xmath0 @xmath29 the relevant reggeons are those which can couple to two ( virtual ) photons .",
    "the ( singlet ) part of the structure function @xmath30 is controlled at small @xmath0 by pomeron exchange , while the non - singlet part @xmath31 by @xmath14 reggeon .",
    "neither pomeron nor @xmath14 reggeons couple to the spin structure function @xmath2 which is described at small @xmath0 by the exchange of reggeons corresponding to axial vector mesons @xcite i.e.to @xmath32 exchange for the non - singlet part @xmath33 etc .",
    "@xmath34 the reggeons which correspond to axial vector mesons are expected to have very low intercept ( i.e. @xmath35 etc . )",
    "+ several of the regge pole model expectations for structure functions are modified by perturbative qcd effects as will be briefly described in the forthcoming sections .",
    "at small values of the parameter @xmath0 the dominant role is played by the gluons .",
    "the basic quantity is an unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath5 where @xmath0 denotes the momentum fraction of a parent hadron carried by a gluon and @xmath6 its transverse momentum .",
    "the unintegrated distribution @xmath5 is related in the following way to the more familiar scale dependent gluon distribution @xmath36 : @xmath37 in the leading logarithmic approximation the unintegrated distribution @xmath5 satisfies the bfkl equation @xcite which has the following form : @xmath38 @xmath39 \\label{bfkl}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 the first and the second terms in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bfkl ] ) correspond to the real gluon emission with @xmath41 being the transverse momentum of the emitted gluon , and to the virtual corrections respectively .",
    "@xmath42 is a suitably defined inhomogeneous term .",
    "+ after resumming the virtual corrections and `` unresolvable '' gluon emissions ( @xmath43 ) where @xmath44 is the resolution defining the `` resolvable '' radiation , equation ( [ bfkl ] ) can be rearranged into the following `` folded '' form : @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 equation ( [ bfklr ] ) sums the ladder diagrams with reggeized gluon exchange along the chain with the gluon trajectory @xmath49 .",
    "+ for the fixed coupling case eq.([bfkl ] ) can be solved analytically and the leading behaviour of its solution at small @xmath0 is given by the following expression : @xmath50 [ bfkls ] with @xmath51 @xmath52 where the riemann zeta function @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 is of nonperturbative origin .",
    "+ the quantity @xmath55 is equal to the intercept of the so called bfkl pomeron . its potentially large magnitude ( @xmath56 ) should be contrasted with the intercept @xmath9 of the ( effective ) `` soft '' pomeron which has been determined from the phenomenological analysis of the high energy behaviour of hadronic and photoproduction total cross - sections @xcite .",
    "+ in practice one introduces the running coupling @xmath57 in the bfkl equation ( [ bfkl ] ) .",
    "this requires introduction of the infrared cut - off that would prevent entering the infrared region where the coupling becomes large .",
    "the effective intercept @xmath58 found by numerically solving the equation depends on the magnitude of this cut - off @xcite .",
    "+ the structure functions @xmath1 are described at small @xmath0 by the diagram of fig.1 which gives the following relation between the structure functions and the unintegrated distribution @xmath26 : @xmath59 the functions @xmath60 may be regarded as the structure functions of the off - shell gluons with virtuality @xmath61 .",
    "they are described by the quark box ( and crossed box ) diagram contributions to the photon - gluon interaction in the upper part of the diagram of fig .",
    "the small @xmath0 behaviour of the structure functions reflects the small @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) behaviour of the gluon distribution @xmath64 .",
    "+ the equation ( [ ktfac ] ) is an example of the `` @xmath65 factorization theorem '' which relates measurable quantities ( like dis structure functions ) to the convolution in both longitudinal as well as in transverse momenta of the universal gluon distribution @xmath64 with the cross - section ( or structure function ) describing the interaction of the `` off - shell '' gluon with the hard probe @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 factorization theorem is a basic tool for calculating observable quantities in the small @xmath0 region in terms of the ( unintegrated ) gluon distribution @xmath26 which is the solution of the bfkl equation . + a more general treatment of the gluon ladder",
    "is provided by the ccfm equation based on angular ordering along the gluon chain @xcite .",
    "this equation embodies both the bfkl equation at small @xmath0 and the conventional altarelli - parisi evolution at large @xmath0 .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath26 now acquires dependence upon an additional scale @xmath66 which specifies the maximal angle of gluon emission .",
    "the ccfm equation has a form analogous to that of the `` folded '' bfkl equation ( [ bfklr ] ) : @xmath67 @xmath68 where the theta function @xmath69 reflects the angular ordering constraint on the emitted gluon .",
    "the `` non - sudakov '' form - factor @xmath70 is now given by the following formula : @xmath71 \\label{ns}\\ ] ] eq.([ccfm ] ) still contains only the singular term of the @xmath72 splitting function at small @xmath62 yet its generalization which would include the remaining parts of this vertex ( as well as quarks ) is possible .",
    "2 we show the results for the structure function @xmath30 calculated from the @xmath65 factorization theorem with the function @xmath26 obtained from the ccfm equation @xcite .",
    "we confront these predictions with the most recent data from the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera @xcite as well as with the results of the analysis which was based on the altarelli - parisi equation alone without the small @xmath0 resummation effects being included in the formalism @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the singular small @xmath0 behaviour of the gluon and sea quark distributions has to be introduced in a parametrization of the starting distributions at the moderately large reference scale @xmath73 ( i.e. @xmath74 or so ) @xcite .",
    "one can also generate the singular behaviour dynamically starting from the non - singular `` valence - like '' parton distributions at some very low scale @xmath75 @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the gluon and sea quark distributions exhibit the following `` double logarithmic behaviour '' @xmath76 where the evolution length @xmath77 is defined as below : @xmath78 for very small values of the scale @xmath79 the evolution length @xmath77 can become large for moderate and large values of @xmath10 and the `` double logarithmic '' behaviour ( [ dl ] ) is within the limited region of @xmath0 , similar to that corresponding to the power like increase of the type @xmath80 , @xmath81",
    ". this explains similarity between the theoretical curves presented in fig.2 .",
    "the discussion presented in the previous section concerned the small @xmath0 behaviour of the singlet structure function which was driven by the gluon through the @xmath8 transition .",
    "the increase of the gluon distribution in the small @xmath0 limit implies similar increase of the structure function @xmath28 .",
    "it turns out to be stronger than the increase that would follow from the `` soft '' pomeron exchange with its relatively low intercept @xmath9 .",
    "+ the gluons of course decouple from the non - singlet channel and the mechanism of generating the small @xmath0 behaviour in this case is different .",
    "+ the simple regge pole exchange model predicts in this case that @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the intercept of the @xmath14 regge trajectory . for @xmath84",
    "this behaviour is stable against the leading order qcd evolution .",
    "this follows from the fact that the leading singularity of the moment @xmath85 of the splitting function @xmath86 : @xmath87 is located at @xmath88 and so the ( nonperturbative ) @xmath14 regge pole at @xmath89 remains the leading singularity controlling the small @xmath0 behaviour of the non - singlet structure function . +",
    "the novel feature of the non - singlet channel is the appearence of the * double * logarithmic terms i.e. powers of @xmath15 at each order of the perturbative expansion .",
    "these double logarithmic terms are generated by the ladder diagrams with quark ( antiquark ) exchange along the chain .",
    "the ladder diagrams can acquire corrections from the `` bremsstrahlung '' contributions @xcite which do not vanish for the polarized structure function @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "+ in the approximation when the leading double logarithmic terms are generated by ladder diagrams illustrated in fig .",
    "3 the unintegrated non - singlet quark distribution @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) satisfies the following integral equation : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the infrared cut - off parameter .",
    "the unintegrated distribution @xmath96 is , as usual , related in the following way to the scale dependent ( nonsinglet ) quark distribution @xmath97 : @xmath98 the upper limit @xmath99 in the integral equation ( [ dleq ] ) follows from the requirement that the virtuality of the quark at the end of the chain is dominated by @xmath61 .",

    "assuming for simplicity that the inhomogeneous term is independent of @xmath61 ( i.e. that @xmath105 ) we get the following solution of eq.([dleqm ] ) : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 equation ( [ anomd ] ) defines the anomalous dimension of the moment of the non - singlet quark distribution in which the double logarithmic @xmath7 terms i.e. the powers of @xmath109 have been resummed to all orders .",
    "it can be seen from ( [ anomd ] ) that this anomalous dimension has a ( square root ) branch point singularity at @xmath110 @xmath111 this singularity will of course be also present in the moment function @xmath112 itself . it should be noted that in contrast to the bfkl singularity whose position above unity was proportional to @xmath113 , @xmath114 is proportional to @xmath115 - this being the straightforward consequence of the fact that equation ( [ dleqm ] ) sums double logarithmic terms @xmath116 .",
    "this singularity gives the following contribution to the non - singlet quark distribution @xmath96 at small @xmath0 : @xmath117 for small values of the qcd coupling this contribution remains non - leading in comparison to the contribution of the @xmath14 regge pole .",
    "+ as has been mentioned above the corresponding integral equation which resums the double logarithmic terms in the spin dependent quark distributions is more complicated than the simple ladder equation ( [ dleq ] ) due to non - vanishing contributions coming from bremsstrahlung diagrams .",
    "it may however be shown that , at least as far as the non - singlet structure function is concerned , these contributions give only relatively small correction to @xmath114 . in what follows",
    "we shall therefore limit ourselves to the simple ladder equation ( [ dleq ] ) assuming that it will describe the spin dependent parton densities as well .",
    "the inhomogeneous term will now however be different and will contain the @xmath32 reggeon contribution .",

    "we will present an estimate of the effective slope of the non - singlet distributions after numerically solving equation ( [ dleq ] ) taking into account the asymptotic freedom corrections i.e. allowing the coupling constant @xmath113 to run .",
    "+ the main interest in applying the qcd evolution equations to study the spin structure function is that the naive regge pole expectations based on the exchange of low - lying regge trajectories become unstable against the qcd perturbative `` corrections '' .",

    "the perturbative singularity generated by the double logarithmic @xmath7 resummation can therefore become much more important than in the case of the unpolarized case when it is hidden behind leading @xmath14 exchange contribution .",
    "even if we restrict ourselves to the leading order qcd evolution @xcite then the non - singular @xmath123 behaviour ( with @xmath122 ) becomes unstable as well and the polarized quark densities acquire singular behaviour : @xmath124 where @xmath125 this follows from the fact that @xmath126 where @xmath86 and @xmath127 are the splitting functions describing the evolution of spin independent and spin dependent quark distributions respectively and from the fact that @xmath128 as @xmath129 .",
    "+ the introduction of the running coupling effects in equation ( [ dleqm ] ) turns the branch point singularity into the series of poles which accumulate at @xmath88 . if one makes the substitution @xmath130 then the corresponding equation for the moment can still be solved analytically by reducing it to kummer s differential equation with the boundary conditions fixed by the requirement that the solution should match the perturbative expansion of the original integral equation @xcite .",
