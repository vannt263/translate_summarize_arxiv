    "singly deuterated ammonia , nh@xmath0d , was first tentatively detected toward the kleinmann - low nebula in orion @xcite and toward sgr b2 @xcite .",
    "however , due to the molecular richness of these objects , a blending with transitions from other molecular species could not be discarded at that time .",
    "the first unambiguous detection of nh@xmath0d was subsequently performed by @xcite in the cold environment of l183 , s140 and dr21(oh ) at 85 ghz and 110 ghz , thanks to the high spectral resolution of the observations which enabled to resolve the hyperfine structure of the lines . since then",

    "the deuterium fractionation was derived to be several 10@xmath7 .",
    "such high fractionation ratios are within the values predicted by gas phase models at low temperatures @xcite . in warm environments such as orion kl , the fractionation ratio was derived to be 0.003 by @xcite and interpreted as a possible signature of mantle evaporation .",
    "more recently , nh@xmath0d has been detected at much higher frequencies thanks to herschel . in orion kl @xcite ,",
    "several excited levels of nh@xmath0d up to @xmath8 = 7@xmath9 ( @xmath3 @xmath4 600 k)d is an asymmetric top whose rotational energy structure can be described with the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 quantum numbers .",
    "alternatively , one may use the pseudo quantum number @xmath13 . in",

    "the temperature and density associated to the emitting regions were estimated to t @xmath4 100300k and n(h@xmath0 ) @xmath4 10@xmath15 -10@xmath16 @xmath17 .    in order to interpret the nh@xmath0d observations , a key ingredient of the modelling are the collisional rate coefficients .",
    "before the current calculations , the only available rate coefficients considered he as a collisional partner @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown in the case of nd@xmath0h that the rate coefficients with he and h@xmath0 can differ by factors 330 , depending on the transition @xcite .",
    "thus , a dedicated calculation for nh@xmath0d with h@xmath0 is required in order to interpret the observations of this molecule .",
    "indeed , as discussed by @xcite , a simple scaling of the nh@xmath0d / he rate coefficients is insufficient to accurately model the observations , at least under cold dark clouds conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follow .",
    "the potential energy surface is described in section [ potentiel ] and the collisional dynamics based on this surface in section [ dynamique ] .",
    "we then describe the rate coefficients in section [ rates ] with some emphasis placed on their expected accuracy . in section [ discussion ] , we discuss the current results with respect to other related collisional systems and finally , we present conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the rigid - rotor nh@xmath0d - h@xmath0 potential energy surface ( pes ) was derived from the nh@xmath18-h@xmath0 pes computed by @xcite , but in the principal inertia axes of nh@xmath0d .",
    "the scattering equations to be solved ( see below ) are indeed written for a pes described in the frame of the target molecule , here nh@xmath0d . in the original nh@xmath18-h@xmath0 pes ,",
    "the ammonia and hydrogen molecules were both assumed to be rigid , which is justified at temperatures lower than @xmath41000  k. the nh@xmath18 and h@xmath0 geometries were taken at their ground - state average values , as recommended by @xcite in the case of the h@xmath0o - h@xmath0 system .",
    "the rigid - rotor nh@xmath18-h@xmath0 pes was computed at the coupled - cluster ccsd(t ) level with a basis set extrapolation procedure , as described in @xcite where full details can be found . in the present work , the geometry of nh@xmath0d was assumed to be identical to that of nh@xmath18 , i.e. the effect of deuterium substitution on the ammonia geometry was neglected .",
    "this assumption was previously adopted for the similar nd@xmath0h - h@xmath0 system by @xcite .",
    "we note that internal geometry effects are indeed expected to be only moderate ( @xmath19 30% ) at the temperatures investigated here , as shown by @xcite for the d@xmath0o - h@xmath0 system .",
    "the main impact of the isotopic substitution on the nh@xmath18-h@xmath0 pes is therefore the rotation of the principal inertia axes .",
    "we have thus expressed the nh@xmath18-h@xmath0 pes of @xcite in the principal inertia axes of nh@xmath0d .",
    "the transformation can be found in @xcite ( eqs .  2 - 3 ) where the @xmath20 angle is equal to -8.57  degrees for nh@xmath0d , as determined experimentally by @xcite .",
    "the shift of the center of mass was also taken into account : the coordinates of the nh@xmath0d center of mass in the nh@xmath18-h@xmath0 reference frame were found to be @xmath21=0.101312  bohr and @xmath22=-0.032810  bohr , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 were calculated for the ground - state average geometry of nh@xmath18 used by @xcite .",
    "the nh@xmath0d - h@xmath0 pes was generated on a grid of 87  000 points consisting of 3000 random angular configurations combined with 29 intermolecular distances in the range 3 - 15  bohr .",
    "this pes was finally expanded in products of spherical harmonics and rotation matrices , as in @xcite ( see their eq .",
    "4 ) , using a linear least - squares fit procedure .",
    "we selected iteratively all statistical significant terms using the procedure of @xcite applied at all intermolecular distances .",
    "the final expansion included anisotropies up to @xmath23=10 for nh@xmath0d and @xmath24=4 for h@xmath0 , resulting in a total of 210 angular basis functions .",
    "the root mean square residual was found to be lower than 1  @xmath25 for intermonomer separations @xmath26 larger than 5  bohr , with a corresponding mean error on the expansion coefficients smaller than 1 @xmath25 .",
    "in order to describe the nh@xmath0d energy structure , we adopted the same approach than @xcite , i.e. we assumed that nh@xmath0d is a rigid rotor and we neglected the inversion motion corresponding to the tunneling of the nitrogen atom through the h@xmath0d plane .",
    "the spectroscopic constants , adapted from the cdms catalogue @xcite and from @xcite , are given in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "as outlined in @xcite , neglecting the inversion motion leads to neglecting the difference between the ortho and para states of nh@xmath0d , which are thus treated as degenerate . indeed , by considering the inversion motion , every rotational state would be split in two states which are either symmetric or anti ",
    "symmetric under exchange of the protons . by combining the symmetry of each state with the symmetry of the nuclear wave functions",
    ", each state will either correspond to an ortho or para state to ensure that the overall wavefunction is anti ",
    "symmetric under the exchange operation .",
    "since the collisional transitions are only possible within a given symmetry , the treatment of the collisional dynamics would be essentially similar for each species , except for the slight differences of energy between the ortho and para states , which is of the order of @xmath40.4 @xmath25 independently of the rotational state @xcite .",
    "hence , by neglecting the inversion motion , we obtain a set of rate coefficients which applies to both the ortho and para symmetries of nh@xmath0d .",
    "finally , we also considered h@xmath0 as a rigid rotor and adopted a rotational constant of 59.2817 @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the reduced mass of the collisional system is @xmath27 = 1.812998990 amu .    in order to solve the collisional dynamics",
    ", we used the molscat code .",
    "since nh@xmath0d is observed in warm media and since the transitions detected include levels up to @xmath28 , our goal was set accordingly .",
    "we performed the calculations in order to provide rate coefficients for the nh@xmath0d energy levels up to @xmath2 and for the temperature range @xmath5k . a first step consisted of adjusting the convergence of the dynamical calculations for these levels and for total energies up to @xmath29@xmath43000 @xmath25 .",
    "we thus performed a few calculations at some specific values of the total energy for which we determined the number of nh@xmath0d rotational energy levels , as well as the integration step required to insure a convergence better than 1% below 530 @xmath25 and better than 5% above this threshold .",
    "these test calculations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : param - conv ] and the parameters used for each energy range are also indicated .",
    "we found that including the @xmath30 level of para ",
    "h@xmath0 in the dynamical calculations had a large impact on the resulting cross sections .",
    "indeed , at some specific energies , we found that the cross sections obtained with the @xmath31 or @xmath1 basis can differ by up to a factor 7 .",
    "an example of the influence of the @xmath30 energy level of h@xmath0 on the cross sections is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] .",
    "this figure will be further discussed below .",
    ".step between the consecutive total energies used to characterize the cross sections . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : rates_j2=0 - 0 ]      as outlined in section [ dynamique ] , the transitions @xmath32 where @xmath33 ranges from @xmath34 to @xmath35 with a step of 2 are predicted to be equal to zero with the cs formalism . using the available cc calculations , we are however able to calculate these rate coefficients for the transitions with @xmath36 and up to 300 k with a reasonable accuracy ( see appendix b ) .",
    "since the current set of rate coefficients considers levels up to @xmath2 , it is necessary to estimate the rate coefficients for the transitions that connect the fundamental energy level to the levels with @xmath37 which are predicted to be null with the cs formalism .",
    "to do so , we extrapolate the behaviour observed for the rates with levels such that @xmath38 and derive the following expression : @xmath39 we can expect large errors of the corresponding rate coefficients , typically of a factor 10 or higher , since this expression is established on the basis of a poor statistics .",
    "however , since the corresponding rate coefficients should play only a minor role in the pumping scheme , these uncertainties should not have noticeable consequences on the predicted line intensities . in any astrophysical application",
    ", this assumption should however be checked .",
    "for example , as was done in @xcite , the sensitivity of the line intensities to the corresponding rate coefficients can be assessed by considering randomly scaled values for these rates around their nominal value .",
    "the accuracy of the current rate coefficients is limited by the following assumptions",
    ". a first source of error comes from the neglect of the inversion motion .",
    "however , we expect that this hypothesis should only have marginal effects on the rate coefficients , at least in comparison to the other sources of error .",
    "a second limitation comes from the fact that the pes was calculated for the equilibrium geometry of the nh@xmath18 molecule .",
    "the pes was corrected for the displacement of the center of mass between nh@xmath18 and nh@xmath0d , but the variation of the bond length from nh to nd was neglected .",
    "the effect introduced by taking into account the vibrationally averaged geometry of nh@xmath0d , rather than taking the nh@xmath18 internal geometry , can lead to noticeable effects .",
    "such a modification was tested for d@xmath0o by @xcite , where rate coefficients for this isotopologue were calculated using the h@xmath0o internal geometry .",
    "differences of the order of 30% were found and we might expect differences of the same order for nh@xmath0d .",
    "finally , a third source of error resides in the use of the cs formalism at high temperatures . as described in sec .",
    "[ dynamique ] and in appendix a , the cs calculations were scaled according to some reference calculations performed with the cc formalism . however",
    ", an inherent limitation of this procedure comes from the uncertainty introduced by the scattering of the ratios which are due to the resonances .",
    "moreover , the ratios were extrapolated at the highest energies . finally , for the transitions that involve energy levels higher than the @xmath40 level , we directly computed the rate coefficients using the original cs cross sections .    in order to have an estimate of the error introduced in the rate coefficients due to the use of the cs formalism , we compared the rate coefficients calculated with the scaled cs cross sections ( noted @xmath41 ) to the rates calculated with the unscaled cross sections ( noted @xmath42 ) .",
    "the minimum and maximum values of the ratios @xmath43 found in the range @xmath5 k are reported in the upper panel of fig . [",
    "fig : accuracy ] for all the de - excitation transitions up to @xmath44 .",
    "in the lower panel of this figure , we report the same quantities , but for levels up to @xmath6 and for the temperature range @xmath45 k. from this figure , it can be seen that for the transitions that involve levels up to the @xmath46 ( e@xmath475 @xmath25 ) , the scaled and unscaled rate coefficients differ by less than 20% ( upper panel ) . on the other hand , for higher energy levels , the differences can be as high as a factor @xmath42 but most of the transitions ( 93% of the 253 transitions considered here ) show differences below a factor 1.3 .",
    "we note that the reason why the lowest energy levels are less affected by the scaling of the cross sections comes from the fact that a larger part of the grid correspond to cc calculations for these levels .",
    "finally , given the variations observed for the @xmath43 ratios , we can expect that the transitions that involve an energy level above @xmath6 will have a typical accuracy of 30% , since these transitions are directly calculated from the cs cross sections .",
    "+     k , between the scaled and unscaled collisional rate coefficients for the levels up to @xmath44 .",
    "the x  axis gives the final level of the de  excitation collisional rate coefficient .",
    "for each final level , the variations are given for all the de  excitation rates , ordered by increasing value of the upper energy level state . * lower panel * : same as the upper panel but for the transitions which consider levels up to @xmath6 and for the temperature range @xmath45 k. ]    to summarize the previous considerations , considering the current pes , we expect that the current rate coefficients will be accurate within 5% for the transitions up to @xmath6 . for higher energy levels , the accuracy should be of the order of 30% .",
    "this holds true for all transitions except for the transitions @xmath32 where @xmath33 ranges from @xmath34 to @xmath35 with a step of 2 . for these transitions and for the levels",
    "such that @xmath47 , the rates should be accurate to within 30% . for higher levels , i.e. with @xmath37 , we can expect an error up to a factor 10 in the rate coefficients .",
    "most importantly , a dominant source of error resides in the fact that the pes was calculated for a molecular geometry which corresponds to the nh@xmath18 internal geometry .",
    "thus , we might expect an additional 30% uncertainty on the rate coefficients @xcite .",
    "the previous discussion dealt with rate coefficients where para ",
    "h@xmath0 was restricted to its fundamental state @xmath31 .",
    "such rate coefficients are enough to tackle astrophysical applications that deal with cold media ( i.e. @xmath48 ) . however ,",
    "at higher gas temperatures , we expect a larger fraction of the h@xmath0 molecules in excited states ( @xmath49 ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ dynamique ] , the cross sections with @xmath50 are of larger magnitude than the cross sections associated with the @xmath51 transitions .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_j2=2 ] where we represent the ratio of the rate coefficients with @xmath50 to that with @xmath51 , for temperatures of 10 and 300k . on average , the rate coefficients with @xmath50 are of larger magnitude , with an average ratio slightly increasing from 2 to 2.4 with temperature increasing from 10k to 300k . however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_j2=2 ] , the variation in magnitude of the rate coefficient depends on the absolute magnitude of the rate , the variation being larger for the rates of lower magnitude .",

    "the ratios are given at t= 10 k ( lower panel ) and t = 300k ( upper panel ) . ]",
    "thus , by varying the relative populations of the fundamental and first h@xmath0 excited states , the number of collisionnally induced events will be modified accordingly , i.e. the number of events becomes larger with increasing the fractional abundance of the first excited state . to take this effect into account",
    ", we define thermalized rate coefficients , following the definition given in @xcite ( i.e. eq . ( 4 ) in this reference ) .",
    "finally , we stress that in hot media , the relevant collisional partner will be ortho ",
    "h@xmath0 rather than para  h@xmath0 and in such a case , it should be necessary to calculate the corresponding rate coefficients .",
    "however , in the case of the h@xmath0o / h@xmath0 collisional system it was found that the effective rate coefficients for @xmath30 and @xmath52 agree within @xmath430% @xcite .",
    "more generally , these studies showed that apart from the rate coefficients in @xmath31 , all the effective rate coefficients with @xmath49 are qualitatively similar , independently of the h@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "as a consequence , in astrophysical applications , the thermalized rate coefficients with ortho  h@xmath0 or para ",
    "h@xmath0 lead to similar line intensities at high temperatures @xcite . to conclude",
    ", this means that in principle , the rate coefficients with @xmath50 can serve as a template to emulate the rate coefficients of ortho ",
    "h@xmath0 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we checked this assumption by performing a few calculations with ortho ",
    "h@xmath0 as a collisional partner . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xs_j2=2 ] , we compare the cross sections of the @xmath54 transition associated with either @xmath50 or @xmath53 .",
    "it can be seen that these two cross sections are qualitatively similar for the energy range considered here .",
    "such an agreement is also found on a more general basis .",
    "considering a statistics over the @xmath55 transitions , we obtained that , whatever the energy , the mean value @xmath27 of the ratios @xmath56 is @xmath57 , with a standard deviation @xmath58 that vary with energy in the range @xmath59 . for each energy , @xmath470% of the transitions",
    "vary by less than @xmath60 around @xmath27 and @xmath495% of the transitions are within @xmath61 .",
    "thus , this confirms that the rate coefficients in @xmath50 are a good approximation for the ortho  h@xmath0 rate coefficients .",
    "prior to this work , the only available rate coefficients for nh@xmath0d were calculated with he as a collisional partner .",
    "rate coefficients with he are often used as a template to estimate the rate coefficients with h@xmath0 .",
    "however , for many molecules , large differences exist and the rates do not scale accordingly to the factor @xmath41.4 deduced from the difference in the reduced masses of the two colliding systems . concerning the deuterated isotopologues of ammonia , such a conclusion was already reached for nd@xmath0h .",
    "indeed , for this particular isotopologue , the he and h@xmath0 rate coefficients were found to vary by factors in the range 330 @xcite . in fig .",

    ", it appears that the h@xmath0 and he rate coefficients show large variations , as expected from the previous studies of nd@xmath0h . at t = 10k ,",
    "the ratios are in the range 1100 .",

    "we obtain the same trend except that the range of variations is reduced .",

    "finally , one may wonder if it is possible to infer the rate coefficients of singly deuterated ammonia from the rates of doubly deuterated ammonia , or vice  versa .",
    "a direct comparison of the current rates with the values reported by @xcite for nd@xmath0h / h@xmath0 would not be totally meaningful , at least quantitatively , since in the latter study , the dynamical calculations were performed with a @xmath63 = 0 basis for h@xmath0 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ dynamique ] , considering a @xmath63 = 0,2 basis for h@xmath0 can induce variations as large as a factor @xmath47 and the magnitude of the effects are presumably similar for nd@xmath0h .",
    "we thus performed a few additional calculations for the nd@xmath0h / h@xmath0 system .",
    "these calculations are similar to the ones presented in @xcite except for the h@xmath0 basis which is now set to @xmath64 . in fig .",

    "furthermore , given the differences obtained between the rate coefficients calculated with h@xmath0 or he , the current comparison shows that in the absence of a dedicated calculation , the rate coefficients of a deuterated isotopologue should be preferentially taken from another isotopologue with the same symmetry rather than scaled from the he rates . as an example , to emulate the cd@xmath0h / h@xmath0 rate coefficients , it should be more accurate to take the ch@xmath0d / h@xmath0 rate coefficients than the cd@xmath0h / he one .",

    "in order to obtain accurate cross sections , we scaled the cs cross sections according to a few calculations performed with the cc formalism .",
    "these cc calculations were performed for total energies in the range 110 @xmath25 @xmath71 e @xmath71 250 @xmath25 .",
    "the ratio of the cc and cs cross sections is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] for a few transitions . in order to correct the cs cross sections",
    ", we performed an analytical fit of the ratio and to that purpose , we used two fitting functions : @xmath72 where @xmath73 corresponds to the total energy .",
    "the latter functional form was used to reproduce the oscillating behaviour seen in some transitions ( like e.g. the transitions @xmath74@xmath75 , @xmath76@xmath75 or @xmath76@xmath77 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ) .",
    "the choice of the functional form is made automatically , and for a given transition the function @xmath78 is selected as soon as the @xmath79 obtained with this function is lower by at least a factor 3 by comparison to the @xmath79 obtained with the function @xmath80 .    considering the behaviour of the ratios reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] , it appears that the ratios depend on the total energy and , in most cases , tend to get close to 1 at the highest energies .",
    "since we are interested in scaling the cross sections up to @xmath4 3000 @xmath25 , we extrapolate the ratios at energies higher than 250 @xmath25 .",
    "to do so , we proceed as follow .",
    "we first fit a linear function using the ratios obtained at the highest energies .",
    "this leads to two possible behaviours depending on the energy where the resulting line crosses the @xmath81 axis ( denoted @xmath82 in what follows ) . in the first case , x@xmath83 @xmath84 250 @xmath25 , and",
    "we then use the @xmath80 functional form to extrapolate the ratios at high energy . in the fitting procedure",
    ", we put as an additional constraint that the ratio is 1 at @xmath85 . above @xmath86 ,",
    "the ratio is set to one . in the second case , x@xmath83 @xmath71 250 @xmath25 . in this case",
    ", we fix the ratio above 250 @xmath25 and keep the value obtained at this latest energy . this extrapolation procedure",
    "thus gives the function @xmath87 .",
    "these two cases are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapol ] where we show the result of the fitting procedure for the @xmath88 transition ( case 1 ) and @xmath89 transition ( case 2 ) .",
    "finally , to insure the continuity between the two fitting functions , we define the function @xmath90 , which gives the correction of the cs cross sections in the range 110 @xmath71 e @xmath71 3000 @xmath25 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a weighting function that vary linearly between 0 and 1 in the range 170 @xmath71 e @xmath71 250 @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] for a few transitions which are characteristic of the behaviour observed on the whole sample of transitions .",
    "as outlined in section [ dynamique ] and [ rates ] , the transitions @xmath32 where @xmath33 ranges from @xmath34 to @xmath35 in a step of 2 are predicted to be equal to zero with the cs formalism . since we performed cc calculations below 110 @xmath25 with some additional points between 110 and 250 @xmath25 , we are however able to calculate the rate coefficients for a few of these transitions and up to 300 k , despite the lack of calculated points above 250 @xmath25 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the corresponding cross sections decrease sharply with the kinetic energy .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios_rates ] for the @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 transitions .    , @xmath94 and @xmath95 transitions as a function of the total energy .",
    "the plain curves correspond to an extrapolation of these cross section based on a polynomial fit .",
    "the dashed curves , which assume constant values above 250 @xmath25 , would correspond to an upper limit of the cross sections at high energies .",
    "the lower panel give the ratios of the rate coefficients obtained with the two extrapolations considered in the upper panel ( same color code ) . ]",
    "the upper panel in this figure shows the available cc points as well as two possible extrapolations of the cross sections above 250 @xmath25 .",
    "the first extrapolation is obtained using a polynomial fit of the cc cross sections ( plain curves ) while the second way of extrapolating takes a constant value for the cross sections above a total energy of 250 @xmath25 ( dashed curves ) .",
    "these two limiting cases seem reasonable in view of the overall behaviour of the cross sections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_null ] . using these two extrapolations",
    ", we then calculated the corresponding rate coefficients for @xmath5 k and their ratios are indicated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios_rates ] .",
    "it can be seen that for these transitions , the rate coefficients are identical , within 2% , below @xmath96 k. for larger temperatures , we obtain larger differences , the discrepancies being the highest at 300 k. however , the variations are always below 25% and this conclusion holds true for the 7 transitions that consider the levels below the @xmath97 level .",
    "since the current set of rate coefficients considers levels up to @xmath98 , it is necessary to complete the current set .",
    "to do so , we extrapolate the behaviour observed for the rates with levels such that @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapol_cs - null ] , we show the various rate coefficients calculated for the levels up to @xmath44 .",
    "first , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_null ] , the rate coefficients associated with the transitions predicted to be null with the cs formalism are systematically of lower magnitude than the rates of the other transitions .",
    "thus , they should presumably play a minor role in the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "moreover , all these transitions show a similar trend with temperature and are roughly proportional . as a consequence , it is possible to mimic the rate of a given transition using the rate coefficient , for example , of the @xmath93 transition .",
    "the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapol_cs - null ] , for the transitions from j = 2 and j = 3 , are approximated in this way by using the analytical expressions : @xmath99 it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapol_cs - null ] that this simple scaling of the @xmath93 rate coefficient can reproduce qualitatively the rate coefficients directly obtained from the integration of the cross sections ( dashed curves ) . from this trend , we can generalize the above equations and the resulting expression corresponds to eq .",
