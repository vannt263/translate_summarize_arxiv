    "we start from the low energy effective model of dsm materials derived from first principles results for @xmath2 ( a = na , k , rb ) and @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the low energy states near the fermi level consist of the four orbital basis @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . around @xmath9 point in the brillouin zone ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian expanded up to quadratic order in @xmath10 is given by @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 with parameters @xmath15 to reproduce the band inversion feature .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be obtained by fitting the @xmath19 result for a specific material .",
    "energy spectrum of this hamiltonian can be readily solved and is given by @xmath20 two dirac points can be obtained by requiring the square root term on the right hand side to vanish , and they are located at @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "the two dirac points are on the @xmath23-axis , symmetric about the @xmath9 point ( see fig .  [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "each of them is four - fold degenerate and can be regarded as two overlapping weyl points with opposite chiralities@xcite ( represented by the two @xmath24 diagonal blocks in eq.([h0 ] ) ) .",
    "one observes that the spectrum is isotropic in @xmath25-@xmath26 plane but is anisotropic for out - of - plane directions . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , we plot the bulk energy spectrum as functions of @xmath23 and wave vector @xmath27 in @xmath25-@xmath26 plane .",
    "one can clearly observe the two dirac points along @xmath23-axis around which the dispersion is linear . both the distribution of the dirac points and the energy dispersion are highly anisotropic . here and in the following calculations , we take the model parameters for @xmath4 obtained from the first - principles calculations,@xcite namely @xmath28 mev , @xmath29 mev@xmath30 , @xmath31 mev@xmath30 , @xmath32 mev , @xmath33 mev@xmath30 , @xmath34 mev@xmath30 , and @xmath35 mev@xmath36 .",
    "this leads to @xmath37 nm@xmath38 .",
    "these parameters agree well with the recent experimental result@xcite .",
    "we also tested the parameters for another dsm cd@xmath39as@xmath40 , which shares qualitatively similar low energy physics as @xmath4 .",
    "the essential features discussed below applies to cd@xmath39as@xmath40 as well .      to investigate the quantum confinement effect , we discretize the hamiltonian on a 3d simple cubic lattice .",
    "we take the lattice constants as @xmath41 nm and @xmath42 nm . we first consider the case where the system is confined along one direction . since the model is isotropic in @xmath25-@xmath26 plane , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we choose a finite width @xmath43 along @xmath44-direction and calculate the system spectrum . due to the confinement , the continuum spectrum now splits into subbands .",
    "this opens up a finite band gap for the bulk at the dirac points . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) , we show the energy spectra crossing one dirac point @xmath45 along @xmath25 and @xmath23 directions respectively .",
    "the confinement - induced gap can be clearly observed .",
    "the green dashed curves indicate the original bulk bands .",
    "one also notice that there exist gapless topological surface states due to the band inversion feature of hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "these states are marked as red dotted curves .",
    "the probability density distribution of three selective states on the surface band is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) .",
    "one observes that these states are indeed peaked around the two surfaces @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that because the system has both time reversal and inversion symmetries , hence each point in fact has two degenerate states localized on each surface , and in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , we choose to plot their symmetric superpositions .",
    "the localization of the surface states decreases from @xmath48 with increasing @xmath23 values , as can be seen by comparing the density distribution at different @xmath10 points .",
    "similar to that for the 2d tis@xcite , due to the finite width , the states on two surfaces have a small hybridization , which opens a small gap at @xmath9 point , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "moreover , one can see that the ( avoided ) dirac point for the surface states are buried in the valence band . as a result , there are always surface states crossing the bulk confinement - induced gap .",
    "this in fact makes the system similar to the usual 3d ti such as bi@xmath40te@xmath39@xcite .",
    "the surface bands in the gap are protected by time reversal symmetry from opening a gap .",
    "the induced bulk gap depends on the confinement width @xmath43 . using the quantum well approximation ,",
    "the effective wave vector for the first few quantum well modes have @xmath49 with @xmath50 . because the dirac points are located along @xmath23-axis and the dispersion around them are linear , the induced gap should roughly scale with @xmath43 as @xmath51 .",
    "this feature is indeed confirmed as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , where we plot the bulk confinement - induced gap as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "the gap shows a monotonic decay with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "next , we consider the system with only confinement along @xmath52-direction . in this case , because the two dirac points projects to the same point on the surface , there is no topological surface state on the @xmath53 and @xmath54 sufaces .",
    "the bulk subbands is isotropic in the @xmath25-@xmath26 plane , resembling that in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , and the situation seems quite trivial .",
    "however , if we again plot the confinement induced gap versus the confinement width @xmath55 , we observe that in contrast to the case in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , now the gap has a periodic modulation with a period of @xmath56 superposed upon the power law decay ( see fig .  [ fig3](a ) ) . to understand this interesting feature",
    ", we note that the two dirac points are located at finite distance @xmath57 from the @xmath9 point along @xmath23-axis .",
    "the minimum of the gap occurs around the dirac points . with increasing width @xmath55 , the wave vector of each subband is decreasing and is going to sweep across the dirac point , leading to a dip on the curve of @xmath58 . using quantum well approximation for the effective wave vector of subbands @xmath59",
    ", one can easily find that the period of the oscillation should be @xmath60 , which nicely explains the observation in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . to further confirm this physical picture",
    ", we check the density distribution of the band edge states corresponding to the dips labeled in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , we see that for a sequence of dips , the corresponding density distributions show increasing number of nodes along the confinement direction , indicating that the states are from subbands with increasing quantum well mode number @xmath61 , which is consistent with our analysis .    because band inversion occurs for @xmath23 between the two dirac points ,",
    "the band gap for a subband is inverted if its @xmath23 is less than @xmath57 .",
    "if we consider the system confined along @xmath52-direction as a quasi-2d system , then the periodic modulation we discussed before is also accompanied with an oscillation in its @xmath62 topological invariant@xcite . with increasing @xmath55 , for each quantum well subband with @xmath23 crossing @xmath57",
    ", it adds a @xmath63 to the total 2d @xmath62 number , leading to the oscillation its topological property .",
    "specifically , from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , we mentioned that the @xmath64 quantum well subband passes @xmath57 around the thickness at point d , the @xmath65 subband passes @xmath57 around point e , and so on .",
    "for the thickness at point h , no subband has band inversion , hence the 2d @xmath62 invariant must be zero . for thickness between d and e , one subband becomes topological nontrivial , hence @xmath63 . for thickness between e and f ,",
    "one more subband becomes nontrivial , leading to a total @xmath66 , i.e. the system again becomes trivial .",
    "the oscillatory behavior in topological character for na@xmath39bi was briefly mentioned in ref .   , and a more detailed discussion was presented for cd@xmath39as@xmath40 in ref .   .",
    "our results are consistent with these previous studies .",
    "the oscillation in @xmath62 invariant can be better visualized by considering the system confined in both @xmath44 and @xmath52 directions . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we plot the spectra for the three thickness @xmath55 labeled by h , i , and j in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , with a width @xmath67 . for point h ,",
    "since all the subbands are trivial , there is no edge states on the side surfaces @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "for point i , one subband becomes nontrivial , as a result , there is a pair of spin - helical edge states on the side surfaces , as indicated by the red dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "one notes that there is a small gap opened at @xmath68 for the edge bands , which is due to the hybridization between the states on the two side surfaces .",
    "note that because the ( avoided ) dirac point of the edge bands is buried in the valance bands ( at least for na@xmath39bi and cd@xmath39as@xmath40 ) .",
    "there are always gapless topological edge states traversing the confinement - induced bulk gap .",
    "these states are protected by time reversal symmetry and forming dissipationless edge transport channels . for point j , two subbands",
    "have band inversion , each resulting in a pair of helical edge states .",
    "hence in the spectrum , we observe that there are two pairs of helical edge states .",
    "because now scattering between states from different pairs are allowed by symmetry , these edge states lose the topological protection hence are not as robust as that in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "we have analyzed the confinement induced bulk gap , and also show that robust topological boundary channels can exist inside the bulk gap .",
    "these channels could be utilized for designing topological devices . for device applications ,",
    "it is desirable to have full electric control because electric control generally has fast response , consumes less energy , and is more easily to be implemented and integrated . in the following",
    ", we investigate the possibility to control the boundary states of confined dsm through electrostatic means .",
    "we first discuss the case by using electric gating on the side surface to tune the surface potential .",
    "let s consider a nanostructure confined in both @xmath44 and @xmath52 directions with a nontrivial 2d @xmath62 invariant as that in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "we model the surface potential by gating by applying an equal onsite potential in the lattice model for the two surface layers at @xmath46 and @xmath47 . because the boundary states are localized near the two side surfaces , they are most susceptible to the applied surface potential than the bulk states . as a result , we could tune the position of the boundary states relative to the confined - induced bulk gap . in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , a surface potential of @xmath69 v is applied , and we see that the ( avoided ) edge band dirac point is shifted into the bulk gap .",
    "if the fermi level is inside both the bulk gap and the surface gap , the transport through the system could be turned off .",
    "this means that we could turn the edge transport on and off electrically , which is much desired for application purpose .",
    "when the two gates are at different potential , a transverse electric field along @xmath44-direction could be applied to the system .",
    "this obviously breaks the inversion symmetry .",
    "therefore the double degeneracy is going to be lifted . here",
    "we model the transverse field as a simple linearly varying onsite potential term @xmath70 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , both the bulk subbands and the boundary states have a rashba type spin splitting induced by the electric field .",
    "we have analyzed the spin polarizations of these states and the spin texture indeed coincides with that for rashba spin - splitting .",
    "this result is analogous to the situation discussed in the context of 2d tis@xcite .",
    "these spin - polarized edge channels will be useful for spintronics applications .",
    "we mention that the modeling of electrostatic effects above is based on a very simple modeling . for more realistic analysis",
    ", one needs to solve the electronic structure combined with poisson s equation self - consistently .",
    "nevertheless , the essential features we discussed above should still apply .",
    "we have shown that the confinement effect generally opens up a gap at the dirac points , which would be desired for the purpose of designing logical devices . in previous studies of 2d and 3d topological insulators ,",
    "one aim is to realize robust gapless topological edge or surface states in the bulk gap , which can be used for energy - efficient charge or spin transport .",
    "however , it has been found that due to confinement , the states on the opposite edge or surfaces can hybridize and this opens up a gap for the boundary states@xcite . in typical",
    "2d tis such as hgte / cdte quantum wells , the edge state crossing occurs in the bulk gap .",
    "hence when a gap is opened by coupling between the two edges , the edge channels would no longer be gapless .",
    "this was considered as a detrimental effect for applications@xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the dsm nanostructures is in fact advantageous in that its edge state crossing is buried in the valence band hence the edge transport inside bulk gap would not be affected ( at least for the cases of na@xmath39bi and cd@xmath39as@xmath40 ) . as a result , there are always gapless topological edge channels in the confinement - induced bulk gap which are protected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "this implies that the dsm nanostructures could offer a better platform for designing topological electronic devices with low power dissipation .",
    "note that the above comparison is made in the native states of the systems .",
    "we also mention that the detailed edge states dispersions would depend on the edge / surface condition .",
    "for example , the edge sates could be shifted in energy by electric gating as we shown in the previous discussion , and be distorted by surface defects or doping@xcite .    to conclude , we have investigated the electronic properties of confined dsm nanostructures .",
    "we find that the quantum confinement effect is strongly anisotropic .",
    "the confinement generally induce a bulk gap at the dirac points and it shows a periodic modulation when the confinement is along @xmath0-axis .",
    "this modulation is accompanied with topological transitions . for a topological nontrivial state ,",
    "we point out that the system is in fact superior to usual 2d tis in terms of robust gapless edge transport .",
    "electric means to manipulate the edge channels are discussed . our result show that dsm nanostructures offer a promising platform for designing novel topological quantum devices .",
    "to investigate the confinement effects , we discretize the low energy continuum model in eq.([h0 ] ) on a 3d tetragonal lattice with lattice constants @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 along the three orthogonal directions .",
