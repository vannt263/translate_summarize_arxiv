    "finally , the accuracy of the variational calculations can be assessed by using lanczos diagonalizations on small lattices and green s function monte carlo within the so - called fixed - node approximation ,  @xcite which gives accurate ( but approximate ) results on large systems .",
    "a detailed description of the fixed - node approximation can be found in ref .  .",
    "in brief , starting from the original hamiltonian @xmath65 , we define an effective hamiltonian by adding a perturbation @xmath66 : @xmath67 the operator @xmath66 is defined through its matrix elements and depends upon a given _ guiding function _",
    "@xmath68 , that is for instance the variational state itself @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "notice that the above operator annihilates the guiding function , namely @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , whenever the guiding function is close to the exact ground state of @xmath65 , the perturbation @xmath66 is expected to be small and the effective hamiltonian becomes very close to the original one .",

    "we also stress that , once the backflow correlations are considered , there is no energy gain by allowing a translational symmetry breaking ( e.g. , by considering a @xmath77 unit cell in the bcs hamiltonian , suitable for dimerized states ) and the @xmath73 solution has always a lower energy than dimerized states . finally , we find that the variational band term of the bcs hamiltonian @xmath78 has @xmath79 for most of the cases considered , except for small @xmath29 , inside the conducting phase , where a finite @xmath38 can be stabilized .",

    "[ fig : energy ] .",

    "we find that the square lattice states persist up to large values of @xmath103 , both in terms of the d - wave superconducting order parameter as well as for the af nel ordering .",
    "the main outcome of this work is that , thanks to the improvement given by backflow correlations , a spin - liquid wave function can be stabilized over magnetic states , for large but still moderate coulomb repulsions and close to the isotropic limit .",
    "these variational results are corroborated by fixed - node calculations .",
    "we find , in particular , that for @xmath54 , which is relevant for @xmath2-(et)@xmath3cu@xmath3(cn)@xmath6 ,  @xcite the insulating phase has a pure mott character , without magnetic order . on the other hand , for @xmath27 , suitable for @xmath2-(et)@xmath3cu@xmath3(scn)@xmath3 , ( or even smaller @xmath11 values ) the insulating phase always shows nel order with @xmath92 .",
    "let us finish by discussing our results also in comparison to other calculations and experimental findings .",
    "first of all , in various papers , it has been suggested that the spin - liquid phase can be stabilized by charge fluctuations that may destabilize a magnetically ordered state .",
    "this claim has been corroborated by calculations on heisenberg models in presence of a ring - exchange term @xmath104 ( that appears in the strong - coupling expansion in @xmath105 ) .",
    "@xcite however , it turns out that the actual value of @xmath104 for stabilizing a disordered phase is rather large and , probably , beyond the validity of a perturbative expansion",
    ". the existence of a direct transition from a magnetic phase to a disordered one has been also found in the original hubbard model , by decreasing the on - site repulsion @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite we do not find any evidence of such a possibility and , in our approach , the magnetic phase is stable in presence of charge fluctuations , even close to the metal - insulator transition : this is the case of @xmath27 .",
    "instead , the spin - liquid phase turns out to be directly connected with the one at strong coupling , while antiferromagnetic correlations become stronger when decreasing @xmath29 .",
    "for example , for @xmath54 , the variational state with magnetic order has a slightly lower energy close to @xmath106 and we need to apply the green s function monte carlo approach to extend the spin - liquid region down to the metal - insulator transition , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] . at this stage",
    ", we would also like to mention that the metallic phase is likely to be not superconducting .",
    "in fact , the bcs pairing @xmath76 in the metallic region is slightly suppressed when improving the accuracy of the variational wave function by considering backflow correlations and , moreover , it is reduced by a factor @xmath107 when the lattice size is increased from @xmath108 to @xmath109 , see table  [ tab : delta ] .",
    "this fact contrasts the previous claim of a possible superconducting phase close to the metal - insulator transition by liu and collaborators .",
    "@xcite    another very important point is to clarify the nature of the low - energy excitations .",
    "very recently , thermodynamic measurements of the specific heat suggested the possible existence of a fermi surface of neutral , @xmath110 fermionic spinons .",
    "@xcite however , it should be noticed that such a measurement involves a difficult subtraction of a divergent nuclear specific heat , and instead the thermal conductivity ( which is not affected by a nuclear contribution ) shows an activated behavior with a tiny gap of @xmath111 .",
    "@xcite this fact has been associated with the existence of spinless `` vison '' excitations .",
    "@xcite from our calculations , it appears that the disordered insulating phase can not sustain a true spinon fermi surface , as previously suggested both on variational calculations  @xcite and field - theory approaches ,  @xcite but it has dirac points at @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , the projected fermi - sea has a much higher energy than our best variational ansatz with bcs pairing , see fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "should our results be correct , either a deeper investigation of the minimal microscopic model for describing organic charge - transfer salts is needed or a reinterpretation of the experimental data is required .",
