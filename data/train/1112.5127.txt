    "the problem was solved when the concept of gauge symmetry was connected with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , in which solutions of the field equations have a minor rank of symmetry than the equations themselves . the breakthrough for this solution",
    "was achieved in 1964 when the higgs mechanism was introduced by englert and brout @xcite , higgs @xcite , and hagen , guralnik and kibble @xcite to generate masses for vector bosons in gauge theories . even though different techniques were applied ,",

    "they add to corrections quadratic in the top - quark mass ( which had been exploited , in fact , to predict this mass successfully before top quarks were detected experimentally in @xmath27 collisions ) .",

    "the main result is that the standard model higgs boson , if it exists , is most likely to have a mass constrained to the range @xmath120 @xmath121 intriguing hints have been seen by both experiments in the mass range of 124 - 126  gev , in particular in the @xmath114 channel .",
    "however , the excess in both experiments is not strong enough to claim a discovery .",
    "hence , the hunt for the higgs boson will continue at the lhc during 2012 .",
    "+ with high luminosity at the lhc , the experiments have the potential to fully cover the mass range for the standard - model boson search .",
    "+      in supersymmetric theories , like the minimal supersymmetric standard model mssm , the lightest of the neutral higgs bosons , @xmath55 , is naturally predicted to have a mass less than @xmath107 135  gev ( see chapter 1.3.1 ) .",
    "this prediction provided a strong motivation for the searches at lep energies .",
    "the masses of the other @xmath3-even and odd neutral and charged bosons higgs bosons @xmath122 in the mssm ( and supersymmetric theories in general ) may be as large as @xmath59(1 tev ) , the typical mass scale of supersymmetric theories .",
    "+    like for the standard model higgs boson search , higgs searches in supersymmetric theories were performed by the four lep collaborations , including all lep2 data up to the highest energy of 209  gev .",
    "the combined lep data @xcite show no significant signal for higgs boson production , neither in higgs - strahlung processes @xmath123 nor in associated neutral or charged pair production @xmath124 .",
    "these null results are used to set upper bounds on topological cross sections for a number of higgs - like final states .",
    "furthermore , they are interpreted in a set of representative mssm benchmark models @xcite , with and without @xmath3-violating effects in the higgs sector . + here , as a characteristic example the @xmath125 scenario @xcite of the mssm has been chosen for illustration where the stop mixing parameter is set to a large value , @xmath126 .",
    "this model is designed to maximize the theoretical upper bound on the @xmath55 mass within the mssm for a given mixing parameter @xmath67 and fixed top and supersymmetry mass parameters , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the model thus provides the largest parameter space in the @xmath55 direction and conservative exclusion limits for @xmath67 .",
    "the exclusion contours from the lep2 combination for the mssm are shown in figure [ fig : exp_mssm ] ( ref.@xcite ) for the lightest higgs boson mass @xmath129 and the mixing parameter @xmath67 .",
    "+ the lower bound for the mass of the charged higgs bosons @xmath130 has been set at lep to about 78.6  gev , significantly below the beam energy as the cross section for scalar pair production is suppressed near threshold .",
    "similar bounds of 92.8 and 93.4  gev apply to the masses of the heavy @xmath3-even and odd neutral higgs bosons @xmath131 , respectively , depending on the mixing parameter , _ cf .",

    "+    after accumulating high integrated luminosity at lhc , the mssm higgs sector can be observed in the production of the lightest higgs boson @xmath55 and the heavy higgs bosons @xmath122 up to 1 tev .",
    "the discovery of the entire spectrum of five higgs bosons is possible only in part of the mssm parameter space .",
    "even though the higgs bosons of the standard model or related extended theories have not been discovered at lep , while the search continues fervently at lhc , experiments at the colliders could constrain the higgs sector @xcite , as potentially realized in nature , quite strongly .",
    "+ evaluating quantum corrections connected with high precision measurements at lep , slc in stanford and the tevatron collider , restricts the mass of the higgs boson in the standard model @xcite to values @xmath29      & \\leq & 161 \\ , { \\rm gev } \\ ; ( 95\\% \\ , { \\rm cl})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , small values are suggested for the mass if the higgs boson is realized as a fundamental particle .",
    "likewise , this observation is compatible with values of the lightest higgs - boson mass in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "by contrast , technicolor in its simplest realization as a high - scale copy of qcd could be proven not compatible with the high - precision data .",
    "complex constructs would be needed if electroweak symmetry breaking were triggered by novel strong interactions . +",
    "direct searches for higgs bosons in @xmath23-decays at lep1 and , primarily in the higgs - strahlung process @xmath77 at lep2 , have ruled out , on the other hand , the mass range @xcite from zero up to the 95% cl bound of @xmath132 so that only a small gap has been left open by lep .",
    "correspondingly , large areas of parameter spaces in extended theories , as suggested by supersymmetry for instance , have been ruled out by the negative outcome of lep searches .",
    "+ the atlas and cms collaborations at lhc have recently reduced the upper limit of the higgs mass in the intermediate range of the standard model considerably @xcite compared with the limit derived from electroweak precision measurements . after excluding higgs bosons in the high mass range up to 453/600 gev at atlas / cms , with a small cut - out in the first experiment , only a very narrow gap , _ cf .",

    "this gap is close to the minimum of the @xmath100 distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : f_blueband ] describing the predictions for the higgs mass derived from high precision experiments  a potential triumph of the standard model .",
    "+ with high luminosity at the lhc , the experiments have the potential to cover also the entire large higgs mass range of the standard - model .",
    "they also exhaust the minimal supersymmetry parameter space by observing the production of the light @xmath55 , and @xmath122 up to 1 tev , though the complete spectrum of five states may only be accessible in part of the parameter space .",
