    "the possibility that nuclei could exist in the form of a ( spherical ) bubble or in the form of a toroid has been pointed out long ago [ 1,2 ] . within the liquid drop model ( ldm )",
    "nuclei of these shapes turn out to be unstable with respect to deformations .",
    "effects may , however , stabilize such nuclei against deformation .    in a series of papers [ 3 ] , c.y .",
    "wong investigated shell ",
    "effects for toroidal and bubble - shaped nuclei using strutinsky s shell correction method .",
    "he restricted his attention to known nuclei near the valley of @xmath1stability and found that for certain doubly magic nuclei ( @xmath3 ) spherical bubble solutions with a very small inner radius ( ratio of inner to outer radius @xmath40.07 ) turned out to be the ground state .",
    "indications that bubble solutions might exist were also found in mean field calculations [ 4 ] and for stellar matter at finite temperature [ 5 ] .",
    "more recently , moretto et al . [ 6 ] showed in a classical model that ld  bubbles at finite temperature may be stabilized by an internal vapor pressure .",
    "in the present paper , we study shell effects for nuclear bubbles in a broad range of neutron ( @xmath5 ) and proton ( @xmath6 ) numbers extending considerably beyond the known nuclei . as c.y .",
    "wong we make use of strutinsky s shell correction method [ 7 ] .",
    "we show that the shell energy may become as large as -40  mev for certain magic numbers of the nuclear constituents and that nuclear bubbles may thus become stable or very long - lived against fission and other decay modes .",
    "in strutinsky s method [ 7 ] , the total binding energy @xmath7 of a  nucleus ( neutron number @xmath5 , proton number @xmath6 , nucleon number @xmath8 ) of given shape is given as a sum of the liquid drop ( ld ) energy @xmath9 and the shell correction energy @xmath10 @xmath11 the shell correction energy has the well - known form [ 7 ] @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the single particle energies and @xmath14 is the difference between the occupation numbers @xmath15 in the shell - model ground state and a  smooth distribution @xmath16 @xmath17 the smooth occupation pattern is defined in the usual way as a  functional of a  smooth level distribution [ 7 ] .",
    "we use the strutinsky method to study the total energy and especially the shell correction energy of spherical nuclear bubbles . the single particle energies @xmath13 as well as the ld energy depend on the inner ( @xmath18 ) and outer ( @xmath19 ) radius of the bubble nucleus . adopting the conventional saturation condition that the volume of the ld remains constant independently of its shape , the two radii are related by the condition @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radius of a compact spherical nucleus of the same mass .",
    "we describe the shape of the bubble nucleus either by the dimensionless radii @xmath22 or by the ratio @xmath23 between the volume of the hole and the volume of the entire bubble @xmath24 the difference @xmath25 between the energy of the ld - bubble and the energy of the corresponding compact spherical ld is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the surface and coulomb energies of the bubble and the compact configuration , resp . measuring @xmath25 in units of the surface energy @xmath29 and substituting the explicit form of the different energies , we find @xmath30\\ , , % 2.8\\ ] ] where @xmath31^{{1\\over 3 } } % 2.9\\ ] ] and @xmath32 is the conventional fissility parameter @xmath33 with @xmath34 the quantities @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the surface constant , the radius parameter , and the elementary charge , resp .. beside the trivial solution @xmath38 ( compact spherical nucleus ) the condition of stationarity @xmath39 has real solutions @xmath40 only for @xmath41 .",
    "they represent a  multivalued function which is shown in the l.h.s . of fig . 1 for a limited range of values @xmath40 .",
    "for given @xmath41 the smallest solution @xmath42 corresponds to the maximum of the potential barrier , whereas the next solution in magnitude @xmath43 corresponds to a  minimum of the energy @xmath44 for a bubble of the reduced radius @xmath40 . on the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "1 we show the energy change @xmath44 by bubble formation as a function of @xmath45 . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the bubble solution is seen to correspond to a lower energy than the one of a compact sphere ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the barrier between the bubble solution and the compact spherical one occurs for reduced inner radii in the interval @xmath47 . in units of @xmath29",
    "the barrier heights are seen to be at most at @xmath48 .",
    "the unit @xmath49 is , however , pretty large . for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and reasonable values of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath35 , we have @xmath52  mev and @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding energies of the barrier and the minimum are @xmath54  mev and @xmath55  mev .",
    "it is not meaningful to pursue the solutions @xmath45 of eq .",
    "( 12 ) to values of @xmath45 and @xmath32 much larger than the ones given in fig . 1 ,",
    "because for increasing @xmath32 the charge density of the bubble turns out to be unphysically large and the diameter @xmath56 of the bubble layer becomes unphysically small .",
    "we emphasize that the bubble solutions obtained in the ldm are not stable with respect to deformations [ 3 ] in the same way as the compact spherical liquid drops are not stable agains fission for fissibility parameters @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , stability can in principle be produced by shell effects .",
    "as two extreme and simple cases of nuclear single particle potentials we consider the shell effects in an infinite square well and in a harmonic oscillator : @xmath58 @xmath59 the depth @xmath60 has no influence on the shell correction energy and can thus be put equal to zero .",
    "the center of the oscillator potential is chosen to be @xmath61 the oscillator frequency @xmath62 is chosen in such a way that the rms deviation from the sphere of radius @xmath63 is the same when calculated with the shell model wave function and with the ld - density @xmath64    we have to add a spin  orbit term to the central potential ( 13 ) or ( 14 ) .",
    "we use the conventional form in the skyrme approach ( see eq .",
    "( 5.103 ) in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] ) @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 is the nuclear density distribution .",
    "we choose the value @xmath68  mev  @xmath69 given in ref . [ 8 ] and neglect the isospin dependence which is recently under debate [ 9 ] .    for the total density @xmath67 which appears in the expression for the spin - orbit potential @xmath70 ( eq .",
    "( 18 ) ) we used the following ansatz : @xmath71 % 2.19\\ ] ] where @xmath72=0.17 @xmath73 and @xmath63 is given by eq .",
    "for simplicity we have assumed that the proton and neutron densities @xmath74 and @xmath75 are proportional to @xmath6 or @xmath5 respectively .",
    "it is seen from ( 18 ) that the sign of the spin - orbit potential is opposite in the inner and outer surface region of the bubble nucleus .",
    "consequently , the magnitude of the spin - orbit splitting is smaller for bubble nuclei than for normal ones .",
    "we , therefore , treat the spin - orbit term in perturbation theory .",
    "the eigenenergies @xmath76 of the s.p .",
    "hamiltonian including the spin  orbit potential ( 17 ) and the unperturbed eigenvalues @xmath77 are related by the equation @xmath78 where ( @xmath79 ) represents the number of radial nodes ( not counting zeros at @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 are the orbital and total angular momentum and its projection , resp .. the mean value @xmath82 depends only on the unperturbed s.p .",
    "density @xmath83 the functions @xmath84 satisfy the radial schrdinger equation with eigenvalue @xmath77 . for the infinite square",
    "well the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained by numerically satisfying the boundary conditions and for the harmonic oscillator ( 14 ) we used the wkb approximation .",
    "we complement the results obtained in the pure ldm ( see fig .",
    "1 ) by fig .",
    "2 which shows lines of equal ld - binding energy per particle @xmath85 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we note that the volume term of the ldm is present in this figure since we do not subtract the energy of the compact spherical ld .",
    "the ld parameters are taken from ref .",
    "each point on the equipotential lines corresponds to a spherical bubble solution as given by the ldm , which is unstable with respect to deformations .",
    "it should be noted that the largest energy gains per particle occur for nucleon numbers 1200 @xmath86 and the corresponding proton numbers @xmath87 .",
    "some of the isobaric lines are cut twice by the same equi  energy line .",
    "if the binding energy per particle in between these 2 points is smaller , a @xmath1-stable isobar lies somewhere on this section .",
    "of course , this consideration is thwarted by the fact , that the ld - bubbles are all unstable against fission . in the ldm ,",
    "the ( spherical ) bubble solutions are saddle points , not minima .",
    "the ld results ( and consequently also the result on the total binding energy ) depend sensitively on the value of the surface constant @xmath35 .",
    "this surface constant contains a  poorly known isospin - dependent part . in our calculations we adopted the isospin dependence given by myers and swiatecki @xcite who write the surface energy of a  spherical ld in the form @xmath88 % 2.30\\,.\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "3 we show the spectrum of single particle levels for the shifted infinite square well with a  spin - orbit term . the levels are shown as a function of the hole fraction parameter @xmath23 ( see eq . ( 6 ) ) . as @xmath23 increases , the diameter @xmath89 of the bubble layer decreases . increasing the number of radial nodes for given orbital angular momentum @xmath90 thus costs an energy which rises steeply as a function of @xmath23 . augmenting a given @xmath90-value by 1 for given @xmath91 and",
    "given parameter @xmath23 implies an increase of the centrifugal energy , which is the larger , the larger the @xmath90-value .",
    "magic numbers come about by the interplay between levels @xmath76 with @xmath92 , which rise rapidly as a function of @xmath23 and levels @xmath93 , which depend more gently on @xmath23 with a tendency to decrease with @xmath23 due to the diminishing centrifugal energy .    in fig .",
    "4 , we display a corresponding level spectrum for the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the general trends are the same as for the infinite square well , but the magic numbers for the same values @xmath23 differ for the square well and oscillator .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "a saxon - woods form centered around @xmath63 would be more realistic and the magic numbers for this choice would be expected to lie between the limits given by the infinite square well and the oscillator .    for both the potentials we observe that the spin - orbit splitting is often reversed as compared to the case of normal nuclei .",
    "the reason was already given in section 2 .",
    "the shell correction energy @xmath10 is shown as a function of @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) at a given value of @xmath94 for the infinite square well in fig .",
    "5 and for the harmonic oscillator in fig .",
    "please note the different energy scales in case of the square well and the oscillator .",
    "the eigenenergies of the square well scale with @xmath95 which is taken into account by the energy unit .",
    "no such simple scaling property exists for the oscillator .",
    "it is seen from the figs . 5 and 6 that the shell energy may produce energy gains up to -20  mev for one sort of particles .",
    "of course , double magic shell closures can only occur , if the two magic numbers correspond to the same @xmath23-values .    in fig .",
    "7 we show lines of constant shell correction energy @xmath10 in the @xmath96-plane .",
    "each point corresponds to a minimum of the total energy as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "one should notice that for this case of relatively light bubbles , the shell effects are especially large for almost symmetrical nuclear composition .    in fig .",
    "8 we display lines of equal energy gain by formation of a bubble . as a reference we use the energy of a spherical ld of the same numbers of neutrons and protons .",
    "it is seen that the gain in binding energy may amount to several 100  mev .",
    "we have still to deal with the crucial question of stability of the bubble solutions with respect to shape deformations . calculating strutinsky",
    "s shell correction energy ( 2 ) for a deformed bubble nucleus implies that we find the eigenvalues of a schrdinger equation in 3 dimensions or at least ( for axial symmetry ) in 2 dimensions . without solving this technical problem",
    "we may obtain a valuable insight by describing the deformation dependence of the shell correction energy as suggested by myers and swiatecki @xcite . in fig .",
    "9 we display the dramatic effect of the shell correction on the binding energy of a bubble nucleus as a function of the quadrupole deformation . the total ld binding energy of the spherical bubble nucleus is put equal to zero . the ld - part of the energy decreases monotonically as @xmath97 increases . adding the shell energy @xmath98 with swiatecki s @xmath99-dependence produces a valley of about -30  mev depth . the barriers on both sides of the minimum are about at an energy of -3.9  mev which leaves us with a barrier height of about 25  mev .",
    "this order of magnitude of the fission barrier implies an almost vanishing probability for spontaneous fission .    what about the other decay modes ?",
    "@xmath1-decay will imply that the system moves along isobaric lines in the @xmath96-plot towards lower energy .",
    "8 is particularly instructive in this respect : if a given isobaric straight line cuts a line of constant binding energy twice and if , at the same time , the binding energy between the two points of intersection is lower , a @xmath1-stable nuclear bubble lies in between . in fig .",
    "8 this happens to be the case for @xmath100 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the energy keeps on lowering along a given isobaric direction , the @xmath1-decays may finally lead to a nuclear composition where bubbles cease to exist .",
    "thus there are cases where bubble nuclei may disintegrate by a series of @xmath1-decays and others where the @xmath1-decays make them approach a stable composition .",
    "the @xmath0-decay , which limits the lifetime of the presently known superheavy nuclei , certainly may also limit the lifetime of bubble nuclei .",
    "the penetrability of the coulomb barrier for an @xmath0-particle depends exponentially on the coulomb potential at @xmath101 , which has the value @xmath102 .",
    "the higher the coulomb potential , the lower the @xmath0-decay probability . for @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105",
    "fm one finds @xmath106  70  mev .",
    "we estimate the @xmath107-value to be @xmath108\\ , \\approx \\ , 20 mev \\,\\,.\\ ] ] thus the @xmath0-particle has to tunnel through a coulomb barrier whose top is @xmath10950  mev above the tunneling energy .",
    "empirically , the @xmath0-decay of heavy actinide nuclei is found to be vanishingly small whenever the emitted @xmath0-particle has an energy @xmath110  mev , i.e. if the energy difference @xmath111 this estimate implies that the @xmath0-decay probability of typical bubble nuclei is very small due to the especially large coulomb barrier .",
    "of course , much more careful investigations of the decay modes have to be performed .",
    "we may , however , safely say that certain bubble nuclei are expected to have a practically infinite lifetime .",
    "it is intriguing to imagine that stable or at least very long - lived bubble nuclei may exist .",
    "their properties would be a fascinating subject of research .",
    "unfortunately , the masses and charges of the best candidates for bubble structure are so high that there is no hope to produce them .",
    "more careful work with the full hartree - bogoliubov theory is of course necessary , especially for determining the lower limits of mass and charge numbers of these objects .",
    "even if bubble nuclei can never be made in an earthly laboratory , they might play a role in neutron stars [ 5 ] .",
    "finally , there may be bubble structures for mesoscopic systems consisting of some 1000 atoms .",
    "this was already conjectured in ref .",
    "we believe that it may be also of interest to investigate whether shell effects favour the bubble topology for certain mesoscopic systems .",
