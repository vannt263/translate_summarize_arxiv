    "the formation and evolution of early type galaxies is one of the major challenges for current structure formation models .",
    "models of hierarchical structure generally predict that field early type galaxies form relatively late ( e.g. , diaferio et  al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "one of the prime diagnostics of the formation history of early type galaxies is the evolution of the mass - to - light ratio as measured from the fundamental plane ( franx 1993 ) .",
    "studies of the evolution of the luminosity function together with the evolution of @xmath4 quantifies the evolution of the mass function .",
    "previous studies of the evolution of mass - to - light ratios have produced consistent results for the evolution of massive cluster early type galaxies : the evolution is slow , consistent with star formation redshifts @xmath5 ( e.g. , van dokkum & stanford 2003 ) . on the other hand , studies of the evolution of field galaxies have yielded more contradictory results : whereas early studies produced slow evolution ( e.g. , van dokkum et  al .",
    "2001 ; treu et  al . 2002 ; kochanek et  al .",
    "2000 ) , more recently evidence for much faster evolution was found by treu et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and gebhardt et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , whereas other authors found that the majority of field early types evolve slowly , with a relatively small fraction of fast evolving galaxies ( e.g. , rusin et  al . 2003 ; van dokkum & ellis 2003 ; van de ven , van dokkum , & franx 2003 ; bell et al .",
    "2003 ) .    these previous measurements suffered from several uncertainties : the signal - to - noise ratios of the spectra were generally quite low , much lower than usual for nearby studies of the fp ( e.g. , faber et  al . 1989 ; jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1996 ) .",
    "those studies based on lensing galaxies used stellar velocity dispersions derived from image separations .    in this _ letter _ , we present high signal - to - noise spectra and accurate measurements of the mass - to - light ratios of four elliptical field galaxies around redshift one and up to @xmath6 and two at @xmath7 in the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios are comparable to those obtained for nearby galaxies .",
    "together with accurate multi - band photometry available for the cdfs , we have measured the accurate mass - to - light ratios and rest frame optical colors at @xmath8 .    throughout this _",
    "letter _ we use vega magnitudes , and assume a @xmath9-dominated cosmology ( @xmath10 ) , with a hubble constant of @xmath11 .",
    "the galaxies were selected from the combo17 catalogue ( see wolf et al .",
    "2003 ) , and imaging obtained by the great observatories origin deep survey ( goods , data release v0.5 ) from the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope_. we selected compact , regularly shaped galaxies with photometric redshifts higher than 0.8 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the color of the sbc template of ( coleman , wu , & weedman 1980 ) at the photometric redshift .",
    "this template has @xmath14 .",
    "the typical uncertainty in the color is 0.1 mag .",
    "lower priority galaxies were included with either lower redshifts or later types .",
    "the cdfs was observed in mxu - mode with the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph 2 ( fors2 ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) unit telescope 4 during 3 runs from 2002 september through 2003 februari , for a total of 14 hours .",
    "the 600z grism ( central wavelength 9010 , resolution 5.1   or @xmath15 ) was used . during the observations towards the cdfs the seeing varied between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with a median seeing of about @xmath18 .",
    "the sky was clear all the time .",
    "it turned out that 10 out of the 11 high priority objects at @xmath19 have the spectrum of a quiescent galaxy , the other one has a bright [ ] emission line .",
    "the brightest four ( @xmath20 , independent of the color ) had sufficient signal - to - noise ratios to perform reliable dispersion measurements ( see table [ t : t1 ] ) .",
    "the restframe spectra of these 4 galaxies are shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "they all show a strong 4000 - break and ca - lines .",
    "balmer lines ( especially the @xmath21-line ) are also present , though varying in strength from object to object ( see table [ t : t1 ] ) .",
    "object 19375 is an e+a galaxy , according to the criteria used by fisher et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for 2 ellipticals with @xmath2",
    "we also have sufficient signal to determine a velocity dispersion .",
    "dispersions were measured by convolving a template star spectrum to fit the galaxy spectrum as outlined by van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) .",
    "we tested this procedure extensively , using different template stars and masking various spectral regions .",
    "the final values ( see table [ t : t1 ] ) for the velocity dispersions were obtained by masking the ca h and k and balmer lines and using the best fitting template spectrum , which was a high - resolution solar model spectrum smoothed and rebinned to match the resolution of the galaxy spectra .",
    "the ca - lines were not included in the fit because this greatly reduced the dependence of the measured velocity dispersions on template type .",
    "the tests using different templates and different masking of the ca lines indicate that the systematic uncertainty is @xmath22 .    in order for the results to be comparable to previous studies ,",
    "an aperture correction as described by jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard ( 1995b ) was applied to obtain velocity dispersions within a circular aperture with a radius of @xmath23 at the distance of the coma cluster .",
    "this correction is @xmath24 .",

    "photometry and structural parameters were determined from the goods acs images ( data release v1.0 ) .",
    "images are available in 4 filters ( f435w , f606w , f775w , f850lp ) , which we refer to as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , respectively .    for each object , the effective radius ( @xmath31 ) and the surface brightness at the effective radius ( @xmath32 )",

    "@xmath30-band images were used for the @xmath8 objects and @xmath29-band images for the @xmath7 objects .",
    "stars were used as the psf .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath31 and @xmath32 vary by @xmath34 when using different stars , but also correlate such that the error is almost parallel to the fp ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the errors in our results are dominated by the errors in the velocity dispersions .",
    "the results are listed in table [ t : t1 ] .",
    "the images of the @xmath8 objects and the residuals of the fits are shown in figure [ fig : im ] .    to determine the @xmath35 and @xmath36 colors ,",
    "fluxes were calculated from the @xmath33-model within the measured effective radius . to this model flux",
    "we add the flux within the same radius in the residual images .",
    "we corrected for galactic extinction based on the extinction maps from schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the correction is extremely small : @xmath37 .",
    "restframe @xmath38-band surface brightnesses and restframe @xmath39 colors were obtained by transforming observed flux densities in two filters to a restframe flux density exactly as outlined by van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) .",

    ". the offsets of the high redshift galaxies from the coma fp are a measure of the evolution of @xmath4 .",
    "we show the evolution of @xmath4 in figure [ fig : fp]b as a function of redshift .    obviously , the field galaxies at @xmath41 span a wide range in offsets , approximately a factor of 3 in @xmath4 .",
    "the errorbars on the individual points are much smaller than the offsets . a model with a single formation redshift",
    "can be ruled out at the 99% confidence level , as measured from the @xmath42-method .",
    "the restframe colors of the galaxies confirm the reality of the variations in the mass - to - light ratios .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : uvml ] , a very strong correlation exists between the colors and the mass - to - light ratios in the direction expected from population sysnthesis models .",
    "the good correlation demonstrates that colors can be used to estimate the mass - to - light ratios , as applied , for example , by bell et  al .",

    "the overall spread in colors of field galaxies is much larger ( 1.5 mag ) compared to the spread found here ( 0.3 mag ) .",
    "on the basis of our high signal - to - noise spectra we have found a rather wide range in @xmath4 for early type galaxies at @xmath43 , indicating a range in star formation histories .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios and colors are well correlated , as predicted by stellar population models .",
    "hence the scatter in @xmath4 is real .",

    "2002 ; gebhardt et  al .",
    "2003 ) , or high mass - to - light ratios ( e.g. , van dokkum & ellis 2003 ) , and this is most likely due to ( still unexplained ) sample selection effects . the last authors found that galaxies with residuals from the @xmath33 profile had young ages .",

    "+    stellar population models indicate that the low mass - to - light ratios of the blue @xmath57 galaxies may be due to an age difference of a factor of three .",
    "alternatively , bursts involving 20 - 30 % of the mass can produce similar offsets .",
    "the current sample is too small to determine the fraction of young early type galaxies at @xmath0 reliably .",
    "large , mass selected samples are needed for this , as current samples are generally optically selected , and therefore biased towards galaxies with lower mass - to - light ratios .",
    "it is striking that the most massive galaxies have modest evolution in @xmath4 , similar to what van dokkum & stanford ( 2003 ) found for massive cluster galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the galaxies with @xmath58 ( jrgensen et  al .",
    "1996 ) in our sample is @xmath59 .",
    "the mass limit is comparable to the @xmath60 mass of an early type galaxy : if we take the @xmath61 of early type galaxies derived by kochanek ( 1994 ) of 225 km / s , we derive a typical mass of @xmath62 based on the sample measured by faber et  al . ( 1989 ) .",
    "the sample as a whole evolves as @xmath63 , whereas the sample with masses smaller than @xmath64 evolves as @xmath65 .",
    "the results are therefore consistent with little or no ( recent ) starformation in massive early type galaxies out to @xmath43 , and younger populations in less massive galaxies , possibly caused by bursts involving up to 30% of the stellar mass . since these less massive galaxies have much more regular stellar populations at @xmath66 without signs of recent star formation , these results are consistent with the downsizing seen in the field population ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) : at progressively higher redshifts , more and more massive galaxies are undergoing strong star formation .    it remains to be seen how this trend continues out to even higher redshifts .",
    "the biases inherent in studies of galaxies at @xmath67 and higher make it very hard to perform similar studies : the optical light has shifted to the near - ir , and spectroscopy is extremely hard at those wavelengths .",
    "more studies at redshift @xmath57 are needed to determine the distribution of colors and mass - to - light ratios of the progenitors of field early types .",
    "such a determination should be based on mass - selected samples .",
    "further studies of spectral energy distributions extending to the restframe infrared will be very useful to constrain the star formation histories of the bluer galaxies better .",
