    "these star clusters could potentially evolve into the present day metal - rich globular clusters and so they are widely accepted to be a good candidate for globular cluster progenitors .",

    "* schweizer 1987 ) ) .",
    "there have been a number of numerical studies of merging galaxies .",
    "there have been , however , only a few numerical studies of star cluster formation in merging galaxies even though it has been shown that resolving a cloudy / multiphase interstellar medium ( ism ) and/or clustered star formation can have important consequences for the formation history of early - type galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we prepared two identical progenitor galaxies and then let them merge from a parabolic and coplanar configuration .",
    "the mass of components in one progenitor galaxy is @xmath5 for the dark matter halo , @xmath6 for the stellar disk and @xmath7 for the gas disk .",
    "the galaxies are modeled using both @xmath0-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) particles .",
    "we employed @xmath8 particles for the two progenitor galaxies for the finest runs where the corresponding mass of each particle is @xmath9 for both @xmath0-body and sph particles .",
    "numerical simulations were performed by our @xmath0-body / sph code , asura .",
    "we adopted the fast scheme ( ( * ? ? ? * saitoh & makino 2010 ) ) that accelerates the time integration of a self - gravitating fluid by asynchronously integrating gravity and hydrodynamical interactions .",
    "in addition , we used a time - step limiter for the time - integration of sph particles with individual time - steps which enforces the differences of time steps in neighboring sph particles to be small enough so that the sph particles can correctly evolve under strong shocks ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* saitoh & makino 2009 ) ) .",
    "the high mass resolution allows us to adopt the ism model with the wide temperature range down to @xmath10 and realistic conditions of star formation ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 indicate density , temperature and velocity , respectively ) .",

    "at the first encounter ( after @xmath16 from the beginning of the simulations ) , strong shocks took place .",
    "these shocks induced the formation of a large filament of cold and dense gas between the two galaxies .",
    "this filament quickly cooled and fragmented to a number of small , high - density clumps , and a large - scale starburst took place in the filament ( see ( * ? ? ? * saitoh et al .",

    "the late phase of the star cluster formation ( @xmath22 ) was mainly driven by mergers of star clusters without gas , since gas in the filament was blown out by sne .",
    "hence star clusters grew hierarchically through gravitational mergers of smaller star clusters .",
    "there is no star cluster with the mass @xmath23 which forms from an instantaneous collapse of a single large cloud . at the final phase ( after @xmath24 from the start of the starburst )",
    ", we found several tens of star clusters between two progenitor galaxies ( see figure [ saitoh_fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is because they were formed only from the gas in the shock - induced filament .    .",
