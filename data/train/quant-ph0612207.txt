    "the basic paradigm of many body physics is to use analytical and numerical tools to investigate the low - lying states and in particular the ground state properties of a system governed by a given hamiltonian . at very low temperatures , when thermal fluctuations are dominated by quantum fluctuations , quantum phase transitions can occur due to the change of character of the ground state @xcite .",
    "what is exactly meant by `` character '' has been investigated in numerous works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , especially in recent years after the discovery of exact measures @xcite of entanglement(purely quantum mechanical correlations ) .",
    "for example , it has been a matter of debate whether a quantum phase transition is always accompanied by a divergence of some property in entanglement of the ground state wave function .",
    "+ unfortunately , except for a few exactly solvable examples , the task of finding the exact ground state of a given hamiltonian is notoriously difficult . as always in dealing with difficult problems ,",
    "one way round the difficulty is to investigate the inverse problem , that is to start from states with pre - determined properties and investigate quantum phase transitions which occur by smoothly changing some continuous parameters of these states .",
    "the suitable formalism for following this path is the matrix product formalism @xcite , @xcite , @xcite which in recent years has been followed in constructing various models of interacting spins @xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to take one step in this direction and in particular , we want to construct as concrete models , ladders of spin one - half particles and see what happens to the entanglement between various spins when the system undergoes a phase transition .",
    "we construct general class of models having a number of discrete and continuous symmetries .",
    "these are symmetry under the exchange of legs of the ladder , symmetry under spin flip , and symmetry under parity ( left - right reflection of the ladder ) in addition to a continuous symmetry , namely rotation of spins around the @xmath1 axis or all three axes ( full rotational symmetry ) .",
    "+ in these models we calculate the entanglement of one rung with the rest of the ladder as measured by the von neumann entropy of the state of the rung and the entanglement of the two spins of a rung with each other as be measured by the concurrence of the same state .",
    "+ we will see that in all these models quantum phase transitions occur at a critical point of the coupling constant , and this point is where a rung of the ladder becomes completely disentangled from the rest of the ladder and the two spins of the rung become fully entangled with each other .",
    "the derivatives of these two types of entanglement are also divergent .",
    "+ we should stress here that we are using the term phase transition in a wider sense than usual @xcite , that is we call any discontinuity in an observable quantity ( i.e. a two point correlation function ) , a phase transition .",
    "+ the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ mps ] ,",
    "we review the formalism of matrix product states ( mps ) with emphasis on the symmetry properties of such states . in section [ ladder ] , we specify the mps construction to ladders of spin @xmath0 particles and set the general ground for construction of concrete models . in this same section",
    "we construct multi - parameter families of models which have specific symmetries . in section [ stateproperties ]",
    ", we study in detail the properties of the constructed states and in particular calculate the exact correlation functions of spins on the rungs .",
    "we also investigate the connection between quantum phase transitions and divergence of entanglement properties in these models .",
    "finally we derive in the appendix , the hamiltonian which governs the interaction of these models for which the state we have constructed is the exact ground state .",
    "first let us review the basics of matrix product states @xcite . consider a homogeneous ring of @xmath2 sites , where each site describes a @xmath3level state .",
    "the hilbert space of each site is spanned by the basis vectors @xmath4 .",
    "a state @xmath5 is called a matrix product state if there exists @xmath6 dimensional complex matrices @xmath7 such that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a normalization constant given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 here we are restricting ourselves to translationally invariant states , by taking the matrices to be site - independent . for open boundary conditions , any state can be mps - represented , provided that we allow site - dependent matrices @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the position of the site @xcite .",
    "the mps representation ( [ mat ] ) is not unique and a transformation such as @xmath14 leaves the state invariant . in view of this",
    "we can find the conditions on the matrices which impose discrete symmetries on the state .",
    "the state @xmath15 is reflection symmetric if there exists a matrix @xmath16 such that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the transpose of @xmath19 and time - reversal invariant if there exist a matrix @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "+ let @xmath22 be any local operator acting on a single site . then we can obtain the one - point function on site @xmath13 of the chain @xmath23 as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath26 , equation ( [ 1point ] ) gives @xmath27 where we have used the translation invariance of the model and @xmath28 is the eigenvalue of @xmath29 with the largest absolute value and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the right and left eigenvectors corresponding to this eigenvalue , normalized such that @xmath32 . here",
    "we are assuming that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath29 is non - degenerate .",
    "+ the n - point functions can be obtained in a similar way .",
    "for example , the two - point function @xmath33 can be obtained as @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "note that this is a formal notation which allows us to write the n - point functions in a uniform way , it does not require that @xmath29 is an invertible matrix . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the two point function turns out to be @xmath36 for large distances @xmath37 , this formula reduces to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath29 for which the matrix element @xmath40 is non - vanishing and we have assumed that the eigenvectors of @xmath29 have been normalized , i.e. @xmath41 . thus the correlation length is given by @xmath42    any level crossing in the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath29 signals a possible quantum phase transition . also , due to ( [ corr ] ) , any level crossing in the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath29 implies the correlation length of the system has undergone a discontinuous change .",
    "here we are using a broader definition of quantum phase transition , that is we call any non - analytical behavior of a macroscopic property , a quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "of course in the models that we construct we observe a more direct change of observable physical properties , namely in one regime we have correlations between spin operators on different sites and in the other we have no such correlation .",
    "consider now a local symmetry operator @xmath43 acting on a site as @xmath44 where summation convention is being used .",
    "@xmath43 is a @xmath45 dimensional unitary representation of the symmetry . a global symmetry operator @xmath46",
    "will then change this state to another matrix product state @xmath47 where @xmath48 a sufficient but not necessary condition for the state @xmath15 to be invariant under this symmetry is that there exist an operator @xmath49 such that @xmath50 thus @xmath43 and @xmath49 are two unitary representations of the symmetry , respectively of dimensions @xmath45 and @xmath6 . in case that @xmath43 is a continuous symmetry with generators",
    "@xmath51 , equation ( [ symm ] ) , leads to @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath53 are the @xmath3 and @xmath54dimensional representations of the lie algebra of the symmetry",
    ". equations ( [ symm ] ) and ( [ symmalg ] ) will be our guiding lines in defining states with prescribed symmetries .      given a matrix product state , the reduced density matrix of @xmath13 consecutive sites is given by @xmath55 the null space of this reduced density matrix includes the solutions of the following system of equations @xmath56 given that the matrices @xmath57 are of size @xmath58 , there are @xmath59 equations with @xmath60 unknowns .",
    "since there can be at most @xmath59 independent equations , there are at least @xmath61 solutions for this system of equations .",
    "thus for the density matrix of @xmath13 sites to have a null space it is sufficient that the following inequality holds @xmath62 let the null space of the reduced density matrix be spanned by the orthogonal vectors @xmath63 .",
    "then we can construct the local hamiltonian acting on @xmath13 consecutive sites as @xmath64 where @xmath65 s are positive constants .",
    "these parameters together with the parameters of the vectors @xmath66 inherited from those of the original matrices @xmath57 , determine the total number of coupling constants of the hamiltonian . if we call the embedding of this local hamiltonian into the sites @xmath67 to @xmath68 by @xmath69 then the full hamiltonian on the chain is written as @xmath70 the state @xmath15 is then a ground state of this hamiltonian with vanishing energy .",
    "the reason is as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the reduced density matrix of sites @xmath67 to @xmath68 and in the last line we have used the fact that @xmath73 is constructed from the null eigenvectors of @xmath74 for @xmath13 consecutive sites . given that @xmath75 is a positive operator , this proves the assertion .",
    "we now specify the above generalities to a ladder of spin @xmath0 particles .",
    "the ladder consists of @xmath2 rungs and obeys periodic boundary conditions . to each rung of the ladder",
    "we associate four matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively pertaining to the local states @xmath78 and @xmath79 . here",
    "we are using the qubit notation which corresponds to the spin notation as @xmath80 and @xmath81 the first and the second indices refer respectively to the states of sites on the legs 1 and 2 as shown in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "the rungs are numbered from 1 to n with a periodic boundary condition .",
    "the operator @xmath82 refers to the pauli operator @xmath83 on leg number @xmath84 and the rung number @xmath13 .",
    "the total spin operator on a rung at site @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath85 .",
    "let us label the legs of the ladder by @xmath86 and @xmath87 as in figure ( 1 ) . in each @xmath88 the first and",
    "the second indices refer respectively to legs number 1 and 2",
    ".     refers to the pauli operator @xmath83 on rung @xmath13 and leg number @xmath89 .",
    ", width=302,height=94 ]    [ ladder ] any operator corresponding to leg number @xmath84 is designated with a superscript @xmath89 . with these conventions ,",
    "one can easily use ( [ mpsop ] ) and write down the mps operator corresponding to an observable .",
    "for example , for the magnetization in the @xmath90 and @xmath1 directions in rung 1 , we have respectively @xmath91 and @xmath92 for the total magnetization in the @xmath1 direction in a rung we have @xmath93 other mps operators can be obtained in a similar way .      in this paper",
    "we restrict the dimensions of our matrices to @xmath94 , and demand that our models have time reversal symmetry so that the matrices @xmath88 are chosen to be real . we will be looking for models which have rotational symmetry in the @xmath95 plane of spin space .",
    "thus we require that there be a matrix @xmath96 such that @xmath97=a_{00 } , \\ \\ \\ \\ [ { \\cal t}_z , a_{11}]=-a_{11 } , \\ \\ \\      \\ [ { \\cal t}_z , a_{01}]=[{\\cal t}_z , a_{10}]=0.\\ ] ] it is an easy exercise to show that the solution of these equations is @xmath98 where @xmath99 is found to be @xmath100 and we have excluded the solutions with @xmath101 or @xmath102 , which lead to trivial uncorrelated states .",
    "hereafter we use the freedom in re - scaling the matrices ( without changing the matrix product state ) to set the parameter @xmath103 .",
    "let us now consider extra discrete symmetries in addition to the above continuous symmetry .",
    "these are as follows : + * a : spin flip symmetry * represented by a matrix @xmath104 , such that @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 means @xmath108 .",
    "this symmetry imposes the following condition on the solution ( [ tzsolution ] ) @xmath109 where @xmath104 is found to be @xmath110 .    *",
    "b : symmetry under the exchange of legs of the ladder * represented by a matrix @xmath111 such that @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "this symmetry imposes the following condition on ( [ tzsolution ] ) @xmath114 where @xmath111 is found to be @xmath115 .",
    "* c : parity * or a left - right symmetry , represented by a matrix @xmath116 , such that @xmath117 with @xmath118 . + this symmetry imposes the condition @xmath119 on ( [ tzsolution ] ) where @xmath116 is found to be @xmath120 .",
    "+ thus when we impose any of these discrete symmetries we are left with two three - parameter families of models , each family being distinguished by the discrete parameter @xmath121 , @xmath122 or @xmath123 . +",
    "it is now readily seen that imposing any two of these symmetries makes the model symmetric under the third one too . a model which has all three symmetries",
    "is defined by the following set of matrices :    @xmath124    such matrices satisfy ( [ y ] ) with @xmath125 .",
    "thus equation [ z23solution ] defines four two - parameter families of models on spin ladders which have @xmath126 symmetry in addition to three types of @xmath127 symmetries .",
    "the families are distinguished by the pair of discrete parameters @xmath128 . + * d : full rotational symmetry * let us now see if we can construct models which have full @xmath129 symmetry , symmetry under rotations in the spin space . to this order we note that to have full rotational symmetry , the matrices defined by @xmath130 and @xmath131 should respectively transform like the spin @xmath86 and spin @xmath132 representations of the @xmath133 algebra , that is , we should have @xmath134=0 , \\h a = x,\\ y,\\ z,\\ ] ] and @xmath135=m \\ b_{l , m } , \\h     [ { \\cal t}_{\\pm } , b_{l , m}]= \\sqrt{2-m(m\\pm 1)}b_{l , m\\pm 1 } , \\h     l=1 , \\ m=-1,0,1,\\ ] ] where @xmath136 form the two dimensional representation of the @xmath133 algebra .",
    "it is well known that the matrices @xmath137 transform like a vector under the adjoint action of @xmath129 .",
    "the matrix @xmath138 should also be a multiple of identity .",
    "thus we should set @xmath139 , and satisfy the following equations @xmath140 this puts the constraints @xmath141 with the unique solution @xmath142 where @xmath143 is an arbitrary real parameter .",
    "this will give us a one - parameter family of models with full rotational symmetry and spin - flip symmetry @xmath144    * remark : * note that comparison of these parameters with the constraints ( [ xsolution ] , [ ysolution ] ) and ( [ pisolution ] ) shows that full rotational symmetry is compatible with spin - flip symmetry for arbitrary values of the parameter @xmath143 and compatible with parity or leg - exchange symmetries only for @xmath145 .",
    "+ the model ( [ rotsolution ] ) has already been studied in @xcite . to see the correspondence with that work , we can collect the above matrices in a vector - valued matrix @xmath146 defined as @xmath147 . in view of our notation for spins @xmath148 and the notation of @xcite in which the single and the triplet states are denoted respectively by @xmath149 and @xmath150 )",
    "becomes @xmath151 which modulo an overall constant is identical to the matrix given in @xcite .",
    "we now study the properties of the states constructed above . for simplicity",
    "we consider in detail only two general classes .",
    "the first class is defined by ( [ z23solution ] ) and has @xmath126 symmetry in addition to three @xmath127 symmetries , and the second class is defined by ( [ rotsolution ] ) which has full rotational symmetry in addition to one @xmath127 symmetry , the spin flip symmetry . as mentioned in the previous section , full rotational symmetry",
    "is compatible only with spin flip symmetry for generic values of the parameter @xmath143 and is compatible with the other two symmetries only when @xmath145 . in order to derive results which can be specialized to the two classes mentioned above we study in detail the properties of the state , defined by the equation ( [ xsolution ] ) .",
    "the matrices are now given by @xmath152 the matrix @xmath29 for this class has the following form @xmath153 with eigenvalues @xmath154 for @xmath155 , the largest eigenvalue is @xmath156 and for @xmath157 it is @xmath158 .",
    "hence the point @xmath101 is a point of phase transition .",
    "the right and left eigenvectors of @xmath29 are simply obtained and one can determine all the relevant quantities of the ground state in closed form , in straightforward way after some rather lengthy calculations .",
    "the reduced one - rung density matrix is obtained from ( [ rho ] ) : @xmath159 where @xmath160 .",
    "this matrix can be rewritten as @xmath161,\\ ] ] or @xmath162,\\ ] ] where we have used the notation introduced in equation ( [ polisha ] ) .",
    "+ from this density matrix one can obtain a lot of information about the observables pertaining to a single rung .",
    "for example it is readily seen that the average magnetization at each single site and hence each single rung is zero , i.e. @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the spin of a rung , implying an anti - ferromagnetic state in which every single site is in a completely mixed states .",

    "the entanglement of this rung with the rest of the lattice is measured by the von - neumann entropy of this state , defined as @xmath172 .    from the eigenvalues of the one - rung density matrix ,",

    "therefore in this limit each rung is still entangled with the rest of the ladder .",
    "this means that a rung is not in a pure state and the state of the ladder is not a product of single rung states .",
    "+ the entanglement of the two spins of a single rung with each other is measured by the concurrence @xcite of this state which for the density matrix ( [ rhosolution ] ) is given by @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath74 .",
    "a careful analysis of the eigenvalues shows that @xmath178 as @xmath169 , @xmath179 which means that although each single rung is not a pure state , it is a separable state .",
    "in fact these can also be verified directly by looking at the one - rung density matrix in this limit . from ( [ rhosolutionketbra ] )",
    "we have @xmath180 finally we calculate the correlation functions of different components of spins of the rung as a function of the distance between the rungs .",
    "we find from ( [ 2pointthermodynamiclimit ] ) that @xmath181 with a longitudinal correlation length @xmath182 and @xmath183 with a transverse correlation length @xmath184 it is seen that the longitudinal correlation length depends on a single parameter @xmath185 as @xmath186 and the transverse correlation length depends on @xmath90 and another parameter @xmath187 as @xmath188 .",
    "figure ( 2 ) shows the behavior of these correlation functions for different values of the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath189 .",
    "[ correlationlengths ] , as a function of the parameter @xmath90 for different values of the parameter @xmath190 . at @xmath191",
    "both the transverse and longitudinal correlation lengths diverge at @xmath192.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=226 ]    an interesting point about transverse correlation functions is that depending on the sign of @xmath121 , it becomes identically zero , on one side of the @xmath193 axis and different from zero on the other side .",
    "thus if one insists on a definition of an order parameter to be zero in one phase and non - zero in the other , then we can safely say that in these models , the transverse correlation function is an order parameter which signals a quantum phase transition .",
    "+ let us see study some limiting cases in these general models .",
    "at the point of phase transition @xmath101 , as seen from ( [ rhosolutionketbra ] ) , the state of a rung becomes a mixture of spin - zero states , and the two spins of a rung become fully anti - correlated in the @xmath1 direction , a fact which is reflected in ( [ correlationsolution ] ) . near this point",
    "the correlation length @xmath194 becomes very large as seen from ( [ longitudinallength ] ) , although the amplitude becomes small since it is proportional to @xmath195 .",
    "thus at @xmath101 there is no long - range order in the model . also from ( [ concurrence ] ) and ( [ eigenvalues of rho ] )",
    "it is readily seen that at @xmath101 , the concurrence ( or entanglement ) of the two spins of a rung becomes maximum and equal to @xmath196 on the other hand from ( [ entropysolution ] ) we see that as we approach the point @xmath101 from both sides , the von - neumann entropy decreases .",
    "in addition , the derivative of both types of entanglement become singular at @xmath101 .",
    "these facts show that the point of phase transition in these systems , is a point where the spins of a rung become highly entangled with each other and each rung becomes only slightly entangled to the rest of the lattice .",
    "+ we can also obtain the explicit form of the state in this limit . from ( [ properties ] ) , and ( [ mat ] ) we see that in this limit , no two spins in a rung can be in a @xmath197 state .",
    "a little reflection shows that they can not be in the state @xmath198 either , since in the absence of @xmath199 , the only string of matrices with non - zero trace is a string of matrices @xmath200 and @xmath201 in arbitrary order .",

    "in this appendix we briefly discuss the derivation of the explicit form of the hamiltonian in terms of local spin operators . for simplicity",
    "we consider models in class a. the hamiltonian for models in class b , can be constructed along similar lines . as explained in the main text , the starting point is to solve the system of equations @xmath230 this solution space is 12 dimensional since we have 4 equations for 16 unknowns .",
    "thus we should find a set of 12 orthogonal vectors which span this solution space and then form a non - negative linear combination of the corresponding one dimensional projectors .",
    "the hamiltonian constructed in this way does not necessarily have the symmetries imposed on the state , unless we choose new linear combinations of these vectors which transform suitably under the symmetry operators .",
    "these new basis vectors are found to be :      @xmath233 \\cr    |2,0\\ra & : = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\left[-{4a^2}(|0011\\ra+|1100\\ra ) + g\\left(|0101\\ra + \\s\\e    |0110\\ra+ \\s\\e|1001\\ra + |1010\\ra\\right)\\right]\\cr   & & \\cr    |1,1\\ra & : = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\e|0001\\ra + |0010\\ra - \\e|0100\\ra - |1000\\ra \\right ] \\cr    |1,0\\ra & : = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[|0110\\ra-|1001\\ra\\right ] \\cr & & \\cr    |1',1\\ra & : = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[-\\s\\e|0001\\ra + |0010\\ra + \\e |0100\\ra -\\s |1000\\ra\\right ]   \\cr    |1',0\\ra & : = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[|0101\\ra-|1010\\ra\\right ] \\cr    & & \\cr    |0,0\\ra & : = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[|0101\\ra -\\s\\e |0110\\ra - \\s\\e |1001\\ra +    |1010\\ra\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath234 + here we have organized the states in multiplets , with a labeling reminiscent of the one used in labeling the states of @xmath235 representations .",
    "the reason is that in a certain limit ( @xmath236 ) these states actually comprise the irreducible representations of @xmath235 which emerge from the decomposition of the product of four spin one - half representations living on the sites of two rungs of the ladder .",
    "in fact for the product of these spin 1/2 representations we have @xmath237 however only the representations @xmath238 and @xmath132 span the solution space of ( [ equations ] ) in this limit .",
    "this labeling is useful because we can see under what conditions , the hamiltonian become fully rotational invariant . note also that we have used the labeling @xmath232 in accordance with the labeling of ( [ equations ] ) for @xmath231 ( see figure ( 5 ) .",
    "the reader can easily check that each of the above states ( or more precisely the corresponding one dimensional projector ) is invariant under the parity operation @xmath239 and leg - exchange of the ladder @xmath240 .",
    "they also transform to each other under the spin - flip operation @xmath241 .    the local hamiltonian which has the three discrete symmetries mentioned in the text and the symmetry around rotation along the @xmath1 axis in spin space ,",
    "is constructed as follows : @xmath242 where the coefficients @xmath243 are non - negative parameters and together with the parameters @xmath170 and @xmath244 form the 10 free parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "of course the total number of coupling constants ( interaction strength ) is 8 , since we can always shift the ground state energy and also set the scale of energy by redefintion of these parameters .",
    "re - expressing the local operators in terms of pauli spin operators and rearranging terms , we find , after a rather lengthy calculation , the hamiltonian acting on the ladder where we have multiplied @xmath73 by a factor of @xmath245 for convenience , ( see figure ( 6 ) for labeling of sites of the ladder ) . note that we use @xmath246 as an abbreviation to denote the operator @xmath247 in the following .",
    "the total hamiltonian is then given by                        @xmath253 this is a complicated looking hamiltonian , with many types of interactions , but in view of the large number of parameters , it is possible to look at specific subsets of the parameter space , where some of the interactions are absent .",
    "indeed the parameter space consists of four disconnected parts , each of which corresponds to one choice of the pair @xmath254 .",
    "let us for example consider the subset on which the hamiltonian has full rotational symmetry .",
    "it is well known that any operator of the form @xmath255 is a scalar .",
    "thus in the limit @xmath256 if we set @xmath257 and @xmath258 , then we will have a hamiltonian which is fully rotational invariant .",
    "on can see that in this limit , all the coupling constant corresponding to non - scalar terms in the hamiltonian vanish and we are left with @xmath259"
