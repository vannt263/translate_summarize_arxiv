    "it is the einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) paper where for the first time entangled states @xcite were used to explore the mysterious nature of the formalism of quantum mechanics . in the course of time ,",
    "it has been recognized by the scientific community that the difference between factorisable and entangled ( non - factorisable ) quantum states is pivotal in understanding the deepest nature of reality . in 1964 , bell was the first person to show that this entanglement implies lack of local realism in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it was quite surprising when it was found that there are sets of product states which nevertheless display a form of nonlocality @xcite .",
    "it was shown that there are sets of orthogonal product vectors @xmath8 ( say ) of a tensor product hilbert space @xmath9 @xmath10 such that even in the complementary set there are product states which are orthogonal to every state in the set @xmath8 .",
    "however , we will never be able to find enough states so as to complete the set to form a full basis of the hilbert space @xmath11 @xmath10 .",
    "such a basis is called an uncompletable product basis ( ucpb ) @xcite .",
    "it is called unextendible product basis ( upb ) if it is not possible to find at least one product vector in the complement of the set s which is orthogonal to all the members of the set @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the notion of unextendibility gives rise to two important quantum phenomena .",
    "( i ) the mixed state which lies on the subspace complementary to the subspace spanned by upb is a bound entangled state @xcite .",
    "it is bound in the sense that no free entanglement can be distilled from it . in reference",
    "@xcite , a systematic way of constructing bound entangled states had been provided for the first time .",
    "( ii ) the states comprising a upb are locally immeasurable @xcite , i.e. an unknown member of the set can not be reliably distinguished from the others by applying local measurements and by communicating classically .",
    "recently , the notion of unextendible maximally entangled basis ( umeb ) in a restricted situation @xmath12 has been introduced .",
    "the basis set consists of fewer than @xmath13 vectors and has no additional maximally entangled vectors orthogonal to all of them .",
    "it was shown that umebs do not exist for d = 2 and there exists a 6-member and 12- member umeb for three and four dimensional cases @xcite . in this paper , we introduce the notion of locally unextendible non - maximally entangled basis ( lunmeb ) in @xmath12 . we show that if we start with a non - maximally entangled state in @xmath0 and if one party applies local unitary operations , we will have @xmath13 vectors out of which we can build up @xmath1 classes .",
    "each class has @xmath1 non - maximally entangled vectors , in such a way that they are mutually orthogonal to each other .",
    "we show that there does not exist any local unitary transformation that will create a non - maximally entangled vector orthogonal to each of these @xmath1 orthogonal states .",
    "so , these @xmath1 orthogonal vectors will form a basis which is unextendible in the sense that they can not be extended locally .",
    "let us first of all give the formal definition of locally unextendible non - maximally entangled basis ( lunmeb ) .",
    "* definition : * a set of states @xmath14 is called lunmeb iff + ( i ) all states @xmath15 are non - maximally entangled .",
    "+ ( ii)@xmath16 .",
    "+ ( iii ) for all @xmath17 and @xmath18 , there exists local unitary transformation @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "+ ( iv ) if @xmath21 , then there exists no unitary transformation @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 . + one can in principle construct an unextendible non - maximally entangled basis differently and it can have more than @xmath1 orthogonal vectors .",
    "the importance of considering the restricted class of locally unextendible non - maximally entangled basis lies in the context of super dense coding . in super dense coding",
    ", we create the orthogonal vectors by applying local unitaries . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to study those vectors which are local unitary equivalent .",
    "one can then answer the question : given an non - maximally entangled resource , what is the amount of classical information one can communicate .",
    "we will see that this locally unextendible non - maximally entangled basis ( lunmeb ) is going to play an important role in determining the number of bits that one can communicate through a super dense coding protocol .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 and 3 ,",
    "we construct locally unextendible non - maximally entangled basis ( lunmeb ) for @xmath24 and @xmath25 system . in section 4 , we give the most general construction for @xmath0 systems . in section 5 , we construct a set of povm operators for a genuinely non - maximally entangled set of vectors . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the importance of lunmeb in the context of super dense coding .",
    "finally , we conclude in the last section .",
    "let us first of all consider a non - maximally entangled state @xmath26 in @xmath27 , explicitly written in the schmidt decomposition form as @xmath28 we show that this state gives rise to an unextendible non - maximally entangled basis of dimension two under local unitary operations .",
    "let us consider a set of local unitary operators , in @xmath1 dimension , which itself forms a basis @xmath29 where @xmath30 to @xmath31 . in the case for @xmath32 , this set of unitary operators can be rewritten as @xmath33 let us apply this set of linearly independent unitary operators @xmath34 on the state @xmath26 locally on one of its qubit .",
    "then we have @xmath35 the states with different @xmath36 values are orthogonal to one another .",
    "but the states with same @xmath36 values need not be orthogonal . in any set of three states , at least two states will have the same @xmath36 value .",
    "so all of these three states are not going to be mutually orthogonal .",
    "so the pairs for @xmath37 , @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "here we note that by taking a vector from each of the above classes one can also form orthogonal pairs like @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "even then one can not extend the dimension of the basis formed by these pairs .",
    "we see that one can have orthogonal basis @xmath43 for both @xmath44 .",
    "it is clearly evident that the orthogonality condition is independent of the value of @xmath45 .",
    "the only requirement is to be a member of the pair must have different @xmath36 values @xmath46 .    now , for a given pair , there is no vector in the remaining set , which is orthogonal to the pair . as an illustration , if we try to include @xmath47 in the first pair @xmath39 , it will be orthogonal to @xmath48which has different @xmath36 value .",
    "however , it is not going to be orthogonal to @xmath49 with the same @xmath36 value .",
    "this argument runs for every pair .",
    "this does not depend on the values of the index @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we see that the index @xmath36 actually discriminates the orthogonal vectors . more formally , we show that indeed there exists no unitary transformation which will increase the cardinality of the set of the orthogonal vectors or in other words can extend the dimension of the basis .",
    "this shows that the basis is unextendible as far as the local unitaries are concerned . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the general unitary transformation @xmath50 here @xmath51 are complex coefficients and @xmath52 vary from @xmath53 to @xmath31 . in the above expression @xmath54 s",
    "are unitary so is @xmath55 .",
    "this in particular implies @xmath56 the action of the general unitary transformation on @xmath26 is given by , @xmath57 at this point , we would like to see whether the state @xmath58 is orthogonal to @xmath41 or not . without any loss of generality ,",
    "we have taken @xmath59 and in particular @xmath60 .",
    "the argument also runs if @xmath61 and also for @xmath62 .",
    "if these states are orthogonal , then we will be able to find an additional state which is orthogonal to each of these two states .",
    "so in order to check that we consider the inner products @xmath63 for it to be zero for all @xmath36 , we need @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that @xmath66 for this to be true we must have @xmath67 this implies that all @xmath68 and hence @xmath69 .",
    "this clearly indicates that there does not exist a unitary transformation , that can increase the cardinality of the set of orthogonal states @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we can not extend the dimension of the basis formed by this set .",
    "let us take a non - maximally entangled state @xmath70 in @xmath71 given by @xmath72 the set of local unitary operators @xmath73 to be applied on @xmath70 are given in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "quite similar to the qubit case , on applying these local unitaries on @xmath70 , we will get the set of nine vectors @xmath74 . out of this set of nine vectors if we take any three of them independent of @xmath45 , having different @xmath36 values",
    ", we will find them to be mutually orthogonal .",
    "however , if we try to include more than three vectors in this subset , the mutual orthogonal property is no longer obeyed .",
    "thus , none of the vectors in the complementary subspace spanned by these three vectors are orthogonal to all of these three vectors .",
    "mathematically , we can see this just like the qubit case .",
    "we use the same general unitary transformation as defined in equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the action of this general unitary operator on @xmath70 is given by @xmath75 next , we check whether the vector @xmath76 is orthogonal to all the three vectors @xmath77 or not . here also without any loss of generality we have considered the case , when @xmath45 values of the members of the set are equal . in particular , here we have taken @xmath37 .",
    "one can also take @xmath78 .",
    "the argument holds true even when the @xmath45 values are no longer equal . on equating these inner products to zero , and on further simplification ,",
    "the condition for having a vector orthogonal to all these three vectors boils down to the condition of having a non trivial solution to the following three simultaneous equations @xmath79 since the determinant value of the coefficient matrix of the above set of simultaneous equation is not equal to zero , so the only possible solution to these equations is the trivial solution .",
    "this implies that the most general unitary operator @xmath55 is a null operator .",
    "this proves that indeed in general there does not exist any unitary operator that can increase the dimension of the subspace spanned by the set of orthogonal states @xmath80 .",
    "thus , lunmeb in @xmath25 is only of dimension three .",
    "in this section , we construct locally unextendible non - maximally entangled basis ( lunmeb ) for a @xmath81 dimensional system . in order to do that , we start with a non - maximally entangled state and then apply local unitaries to it .",
    "we consider two types of non - maximally entangled states . in the first subsection",
    ", we consider a genuinely non - maximally entangled state . in the second subsection , we consider non - maximally entangled state which is however maximally entangled in its subspace . in the first case",
    "we construct a lunmeb of dimension @xmath1 , while in the second case the basis is of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider a non - maximally entangled set of vectors in @xmath0 .",
    "the elements of this non - maximally entangled set of vectors are given by , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the normalization constant and is equal to @xmath85 . if the above set is part of a set of @xmath13 orthonormal basis vectors , then the coefficients @xmath86 should satisfy the following condition , @xmath87 where the indices @xmath45 , @xmath88 , @xmath36 and @xmath89 take integer values between @xmath53 and @xmath31 . for",
    "a system of two qudits , these vectors @xmath90 naturally fall into @xmath1 classes .",
    "each class is labeled by @xmath45 . within each class , there are @xmath1 states , which are labeled by @xmath36 .",
    "we now prove the central result of this paper .",
    "* theorem : * for a given non - maximally entangled state , we can construct at most @xmath1 mutually orthogonal states by applying local unitary transformations .",
    "this set of states is being labeled as locally unextendible non - maximally entangled basis ( lunmeb ) .",
    "* proof : * to prove this , we start with any one of the basis vector from the set @xmath90 and apply a specific set of linearly independent unitary operators to see that for a fixed value of @xmath45 there are only @xmath1 vectors which are orthogonal to each other",
    ". however , the question remains whether there exists any unitary transformation which will extend the dimension of this basis from @xmath1 to @xmath91 .",
    "we find the answer to this question is no .",
    "let us consider a vector ( qudit ) from this set of vectors @xmath90 , written explicitly in the schmidt decomposition form as @xmath92 here we consider a specific set of linearly independent unitary operators @xmath93 which itself form a basis .",
    "this set of unitary operators are @xmath94 .",
    "the action of these unitary operators on a specific state @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 next we apply two different general unitary transformations @xmath93 , @xmath97 on @xmath98 to see how many of these states could be orthogonal .",
    "after applying the unitary transformations the resultant states are given by @xmath99 , for which the states @xmath100 and @xmath101 are orthogonal to each other .",
    "now , taking the inner product between these two vectors we obtain @xmath102 this implies that we have @xmath103 the condition obtained in equation ( 19 ) can be satisfied only when @xmath104 .",
    "so the set of orthogonal states will have different @xmath36 values .",
    "the orthogonality condition is independent of @xmath45 and will hold for both @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "so , without any loss of generality , we built up the classes for fixing the values of @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath45 runs from @xmath53 to @xmath31 , we can have @xmath1 classes and for each class we will have @xmath1 orthogonal vectors as @xmath36 varies from @xmath53 to @xmath31 . for a given @xmath45 ,",
    "this set is given by @xmath107 .",
    "so this set of basis vectors clearly satisfies the first three conditions of the definition of lunmeb .",
    "next we wish to show that if we apply most general unitary transformations on any of the basis state we can not get an additional orthogonal state .",
    "let us consider the most general unitary transformation @xmath55 already defined in equation ( 5 ) . without any loss of generality , let us choose @xmath108 from the set @xmath109 and apply the most general unitary transformation .",
    "the resultant state after this transformation is given by @xmath110 at this point we would like to see whether the state @xmath58 is orthogonal to @xmath111 or not .",
    "if it is , then we will be able to find an additional state which is orthogonal to each of these @xmath1 states .",
    "so in order to check that we consider the inner products @xmath112 next we would like to see whether the above expression can be zero for all @xmath36 , i.e @xmath113 .",
    "this implies that we have @xmath114 since @xmath115 , this can only be zero , if we have the following set of equations @xmath116 one solution for this above set of equations is the trivial solution , i.e , @xmath117 .",
    "this implies that @xmath118 .",
    "this shows that we can not construct additional orthogonal vector .",
    "the question still remains whether there exists a non trivial solution for this set of equations or not .",
    "we note that these conditions are independent of @xmath36 .",
    "so if there is a non trivial solution for one @xmath36 , then it will be true for all @xmath36 .",
    "for a non trivial solution to exist we must have @xmath119 , where @xmath120 . since we know that @xmath121 is an unitary matrix with a determinant value equal to 1 , so this implies @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the only solution for the system of equations is the trivial solution , i.e @xmath123 .",
    "this clearly indicates that there exists no local unitary transformation which can extend the basis beyond this @xmath1 orthogonal vectors .",
    "we conclude that the set of of states @xmath107 forms a lunmeb in @xmath82 .      in this subsection ,",
    "we consider the case when a non - maximally entangled set in @xmath82 is maximally entangled in the subspace @xmath124 .",
    "let us consider a maximally entangled state in this subspace which is given by @xmath125 here we see that there exists a set of unitary operators which when acted on this particular state locally gives rise to a set of @xmath2 set of orthogonal basis vectors .",
    "we call this set of these basis vectors locally unextendible in the sense that there exists no vectors in the complementary subspace which will be orthogonal to all of these vectors",
    ". the set of unitary operators which are going to serve our purpose is given by @xmath126 quite similar to the previous subsection , here also we apply two general unitary transformations @xmath127 and @xmath128 on @xmath129 to see how many of them are orthogonal to each other . taking the inner products between the two resultant vectors @xmath130 and",
    "@xmath131 , we get the condition , @xmath132 this implies that we have @xmath133 this expression is true for all values of @xmath45 and @xmath134 . not only that it is also independent of @xmath36 .",
    "so for each value of @xmath45 there are @xmath135 orthogonal vectors and @xmath45 itself ranges from @xmath136",
    ". therefore , together the basis contains @xmath2 vectors .",
    "thus we see that if we start with a non - maximally entangled state which is maximally entangled in its subspace and apply local unitaries we can generate a basis of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath137 , the number of orthogonal basis vectors are @xmath138 respectively .",
    "one can show this basis to be unextendible in the sense that if one applies the most general unitary transformation on @xmath129 , the resultant state obtained is not orthogonal to all members of the basis .",
    "thus we see that in principle we are able to generate a lunmeb in @xmath0 of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "this is only possible if the non - maximally entangled state to start with is maximally entangled in the largest subspace .",
    "for general @xmath13 non - maximally entangled states of vectors we have seen that there are @xmath1 classes of vectors each containing @xmath1 vectors which are mutually orthogonal to each other .",
    "so in principle we can distinguish these @xmath1 vectors .",
    "however , if we take one vector from each of these @xmath1 classes , they are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "it turns out that we can distinguish these states unambiguously , if not perfectly , by constructing the appropriate povm operators .",
    "let us consider the following @xmath1 non - orthogonal vectors each taken from @xmath1 different classes , @xmath139 are the schmidt coefficients and the index @xmath140 takes values from @xmath141 . also @xmath142 .",
    "our goal is not necessarily to construct optimal set of povm operators , but just a set of operators for unambiguous discrimination of these states .",
    "one technique to construct a set of such operators is to find a orthogonal vector corresponding to each vector in such a way that it is not orthogonal to the remaining @xmath31 vectors .",
    "one such construction is @xmath143 and @xmath144 is the normalization constant .",
    "the povm operators are then given by , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is a constant and @xmath147 is the operator corresponding to the inconclusive outcome .",
    "we choose the constant @xmath146 such that the operator @xmath147 is positive . without any loss of generality",
    ", we assume the ordering of the schmidt s coefficients to be @xmath148",
    ". then we can choose @xmath146 as @xmath149 to make @xmath147 positive .",
    "therefore the the probability of failure for not discriminating the states is given by , @xmath150 .",
    "thus we show that in principle we can construct povm operators which can distinguish these states with a certain probability of success .",
    "the probability of distinguishing @xmath1 non - maximally entangled states of a qudit has also been considered in ref @xcite .",
    "however , there appropriate povm operators were not constructed . instead , the approach of duan and guo @xcite was taken .",

    "alice sends her qubit to bob after one of the local unitaries are applied .",
    "the state obtained by bob will be one of the four basis vectors , so he performs the measurement in the bell basis to obtain two bits of information .",
    "it is quite well known that if we have a maximally entangled state in @xmath82 as our resource , then we can send @xmath154 bits of classical information . in the asymptotic case ,",
