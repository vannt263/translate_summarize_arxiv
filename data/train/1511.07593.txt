    "ultracold quantum gases have in recent years shown that they can be used as clean , cold and highly controllable simulators for fundamental effects in solid - state physics .",
    "notable examples of these include strongly correlated lattice systems , abrikosov vortex states , artificial gauge fields , and electronic spin - systems @xcite . here",

    "this results in so - called moir super - lattices which are known to appear in many solid - state @xcite , and even biological  @xcite , systems .    many of the effects observed in solid state physics owe their origin to the underlying periodicity of the system .",

    "combining lasers with two or more differing wave - vectors can allow for the creation of super - structures , such as double well lattices or more exotic geometries @xcite .",
    "such super - lattices can , for example , be used to realise optical gauge fields for neutral atoms  @xcite . given their experimental accessibility , optical lattices and super - lattices allow for studying interesting and often exotic new physics .",
    "more recently , spatially periodic systems ( super - solids ) have also been predicted to appear in the presence of extended interactions  @xcite .",
    "using optical lattices on condensates which carry angular momentum is more complicated , as the rotation of the system is at odds with the ( experimentally enforced ) stationarity of the lasers that create the optical lattice .",
    "assuming , however , that an optical lattice could be stationary in the co - rotating frame ( see  @xcite for an interesting example ) , several effects have been predicted in recent years .",
    "the pinning of vortices by a ramped optical lattice potential  @xcite shows that the vortices follow the lattice maxima , assuming a blue - detuned field . increasing",
    "the optical lattice strength therefore causes the vortex lattice structure to undergo a phase transition from triangular to the geometry of the pinning lattice .    in this work",
    "we propose a different approach to combining a rapidly rotating vortex lattice in a bose ",
    "einstein condensate with an optical lattice : switching the optical lattice on for a very short amount of time ( such that only a phase is imprinted ) creates a transient phononic excitation pattern of the same periodicity as the optical pulse . the combination of this excitation pattern , and that from the vortex lattice , generates a moir super - lattice pattern in the condensate density @xcite .",
