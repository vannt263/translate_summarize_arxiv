    "the time constants derived from single exponential fits to the data are presented in table  [ time_const_table_without_control_bare_cavity ] .",
    "the measurements show that the decay of the light in the cavity mode is rapid ( @xmath31s , both on and off resonance . in all cases",
    "the decay rates measured are limited by the response time of the photo - diode used . for the rise times , the off - resonant buildup of power in the cavity mode is rapid ( measurement limited by the photo - diode response time ) , where as the on - resonance buildup time constant is @xmath32s for @xmath11 and @xmath4 180 @xmath20s for @xmath12 .",
    "the large on - resonance rise time of the transmitted light and hence the intra - cavity intensity buildup rate can be directly related to the photon loss from the cavity mode due to resonant scattering of photons by the atoms .",
    "we observe that the time constants for establishment of the steady - state circulating intensity , and therefore steady transmission , are in the ratio of the transition strengths of the respective @xmath0rb atomic resonances .    .on- and off - resonance rise and fall time constants of the probe beam transmitted through the atom - cavity system .",
    "the reported time constants with standard deviation errors are derived from single exponential fits to the transmitted pd@xmath28 signals for the various cases .",
    "the control beam is off and the frequencies for the measurements are identified in the text and in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbspectra3 ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a direct consequence of building up intensity in the cavity mode with a weak control beam intersecting the mode is that it allows the atom - cavity system to be utilized as a positive - logic all - optical switch . in this case , the cavity transmits the probe light when the control light is on , and inhibits the transmission when the control beam is off .",
    "the experimental details for the measurement of the transient response for positive - logic switching remains the same as in the negative logic case .",
    "the responses at the rising and falling edges are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : poslogictransient ] ( a ) and ( b ) . as in the case of negative logic switching ,",
    "the transmission response is best fitted by a double exponential .",
    "the fast and slow time constants provided in table  [ table : poslog ] match well with those of the negative logic case , given in table  [ table : neglog ] .",
    "the swiching and control of cavity beam transmission results from changes of the populations in the ground states for the atomic system .",
    "the experimental system here reduces to two widely studied quantum systems . in the negative - logic case , the reduced transition system is a restricted , four - level system and for the positive - logic case , it is essentially a two - level system , with decay losses to cavity uncoupled states .",
    "since the experiments are with a vapor cell , at room temperature and the size of the cell is much larger than the mode volume , the system can be treated as an open system in the grand canonical ensemble , where atoms continuously enter and exit the mode volume . a complete analytic and numerical description of such a system is complex , but a few careful simplifying assumptions can allow the generic system to be described with qualitative accuracy , as discussed in a separate manuscript  @xcite .    in the presence of the control beam ,",
    "the atomic state populations of the rb atoms in the intersection volume are altered relative to the rest of the cavity mode .",
    "when @xmath33 , the photon loss from the cavity mode due to resonant scattering by the atoms reduces .",
    "the medium becomes more transparent to the probe light in the intersection volume , increasing the circulating intensity in the cavity mode .",
    "this in turn increases the saturation of the medium , resulting in increased transmission of the input probe light , till a steady state energy density is established .",
    "the above discussion is consistent with the changed hysteresis conditions of the atom - cavity system .    when @xmath5 and @xmath34 are the set frequencies , the cavity transmission of the probe beam is suppressed . here",
    "a fraction of the excited state population is optically pumped back into resonance with @xmath5 , resulting in the cavity mode atoms moving away from the saturation condition , creating more fluorescence and therefore radiative loss from the cavity mode , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluorescence ] ( a ) .",
    "due to the continuity of the probe light beam energy density across the whole cavity mode , the intensity in the entire mode decreases , till the steady state corresponding to the atom cavity response curves for this altered system is reached .",
    "the enhancement and suppression of the transmitted probe light in the atom - cavity system with the control beam can be used to implement a high fidelity all - optical switch , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : switching ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : risefalltimeofswitching ] for the case of negative logic , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : poslogictransient ] for positive logic .",
    "while this high fidelity is observed , the question of the response time for the change in state of the cavity mode needs explanation .",
    "the transients show a fast and slow time constant , for both negative and positive logic switching on the rising and falling edges . in both cases , the short time constants are measured to be a few 10 @xmath20s and the long time constants are in the range of @xmath35s .",
    "the atom flow affects the populations in the ground and excited states , both in the intersection volume and along the length of the cavity mode .",
    "consequently , the state of transmission of the cavity changes in a complex manner , which is reflected in the temporal evolution of the cavity mode intensity  @xcite .",
    "essentially the fast response comes from the light - atom interaction which exist in the cavity mode at the time of switching and the slow response is due to the flow of atoms in and out of the cavity mode .",
    "an important future perspective of the study in this article is the interaction between laser cooled fluorescing atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot )  @xcite and a cavity within which the mot is created  @xcite .",
    "the optical control of atom - cavity interactions  @xcite are of considerable importance for future experiments where fluorescing atoms in mixtures couple to cavity modes  @xcite .",
    "the present study therefore constitutes a preliminary , hot - vapor precursor to the corresponding cold vapor experiments .",
    "the motivation for performing these measurements on the d2 resonances for @xmath0rb stems from this connection to cold atomic vapour experiments , where @xmath12 maps to the cooling and @xmath11 maps to the repumping transitions .",
    "in this work we demonstrate optical control of resonant light , in transmission through a standing wave cavity , built around hot atomic vapor .",
    "the power of control light required to affect the transmitted intensity of the resonant probe light through the cavity is shown to be a few hundred microwatt .",
    "the control light exhibits a threshold power , above which it alters the transmission properties of the cavity .",
    "the cavity - mode light can be extinguished by manipulating the control intensity , a fact which is used to demonstrate high - fidelity switching of transmitted light through this system .",
    "both steady state and transient processes are experimentally characterized for this system .",
    "the physics of this system is discussed within the context of a driven multi - level quantum system  @xcite , and qualitative explanations for the observed steady - state and transient phenomena are provided .",
    "the robustness and ease of working with this system makes it suitable for exploitation as an all - optical switch , which operates with either positive or negative logic .",
    "the extension of this experimental technique to an ensemble of cold atoms contained within an cavity is a exciting possibility for probing atom - cavity coupling at ultracold temperatures . in this case",
    ", both collective strong coupling of the atoms to the cavity mode and the elimination of effects due to doppler broadening will allow a number of possible experiments in the future .",
