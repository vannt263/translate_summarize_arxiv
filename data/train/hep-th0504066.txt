    "vacuum forces arise acting on constraining boundaries .",
    "the particular features of these forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold , the boundary geometries and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field . since the original work by casimir @xcite many theoretical and experimental works have been done on this problem ( see , e.g. , most97,plun86,bord01,milt02 and references therein ) . however , there are still difficulties in both interpretation and renormalization of the casimir effect .",
    "moreover , the absence of a complete renormalization procedure , in practice , limits all exact calculations to the special case of highly - symmetric boundary configurations ( parallel plates , sphere , cylinder ) with a specific background metric . from this point of view",
    "the wedge with a cylindrical boundary is an interesting system , since the geometry is nontrivial and it includes two dynamical parameters , radius and angle , for phenomenological purposes . due to the formal analogy that exists between a wedge and a straight cosmic string , the corresponding results can be applied to cosmic strings . in this paper",

    "the total casimir energy of a semi - circular infinite cylindrical shell with perfectly conducting walls is considered in @xcite by using the zeta function technique . for a scalar field with an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter",
    "the vacuum energy density in the geometry of a wedge with an arbitrary opening angle and with a cylindrical boundary is evaluated in reza02 .",
    "this geometry is interesting from the point of view of general analysis for surface divergences in the expectation values of local physical observables for boundaries with discontinuities .",
    "the nonsmoothness of the boundary generates additional contributions to the heat kernel coefficients ( see , for instance , the discussion in @xcite and references therein ) . as in @xcite ,",
    "our method here employs the mode summation and is based on a variant of the generalized abel - plana formula @xcite combined with the point - splitting technique .",
    "this allows to extract from the vacuum expectation values the parts due to a wedge without a cylindrical shell and to present the cylindrical parts in terms of strongly convergent integrals .",
