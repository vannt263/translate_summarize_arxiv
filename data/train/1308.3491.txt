    "modified gravity theories @xcite have been widely studied as a possible alternative to the dark energy scenarios @xcite ( including the standard cosmological constant , or @xmath1cdm , paradigm ) to explain the observed speed up of the cosmic expansion @xcite .",
    "there has been growing interest in this area recently because study in such models not only sheds light on our understanding of the origin and nature of the cosmic acceleration , but also provides tests of the standard gravity theory , general relativity ( gr ) , on cosmic scales .",
    "such tests are crucial to establish gr as the theory of gravity of the whole universe , valid also on cosmological scales . regardless of passing the cosmological tests , however , any theory of gravity must satisfy a number of stringent local , or solar system , constraints @xcite , as gr does .",
    "such a requirement is highly nontrivial , because the universality of gravity theory means that if it is modified on cosmic scales , changes can usually also be expected on much smaller scales .",
    "therefore , any viable modified gravity theory must have some dynamical mechanism by which such modifications are suppressed and gr is recovered in high - density ( or deep - potential ) regions such as the solar system .",
    "such mechanisms are known as ` screening mechanisms ' in the literature .",
    "the screening mechanism makes gravity behave in different ways in different environments , and this environmental dependence often implies strong nonlinearity in the associated field equations , making studies of these models numerically particularly challenging .",
    "many of the modified gravity theories studied so far have one or more dynamical scalar - type ( spin-0 ) fields to mediate the modified gravitational force .",
    "there are two major classes of such theories . in the first class",
    ", the screening is realised by a nonlinear coupling specifying the interaction between the scalar field and matter ( or curvature ) , together with a nonlinear potential specifying the scalar field self - interaction . with appropriate choices of the coupling and potential , the scalar degree of freedom",
    "can become very heavy or extremely weakly coupled with matter in dense regions , so that it hardly mediates any interaction between matter particles .",
    "the chameleon @xcite ( including @xmath2 gravity model @xcite , see also @xcite ) , dilaton @xcite and symmetron @xcite models are well - known examples in this class .",
    "out of these models , @xmath2 gravity ( notably the model of @xcite ) is the most well studied .",
    "there have been a number of works which investigated structure formation in this model in the nonlinear regime , with the help of @xmath0-body simulations @xcite . to facilitate the study , an @xmath0-body code , ecosmog @xcite ,",
    "was developed , based on the publicly available code ramses @xcite .",
    "this code is efficiently parallelised using mpi and makes large and high - resolution simulations of @xmath2 gravity feasible ( see @xcite for other recent developments of modified gravity simulation codes ) . using a parameterisation for this class of modified gravity theories @xcite ,",
    "ecosmog has also been generalised to study generic chameleon , dilaton and symmetron models @xcite .    the second class of scalar - type modified gravity theories , with the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite as a representative example , achieves the screening through nonlinear derivative self - couplings of the scalar field .",
    "here , the nonlinearity causes interference between the gravitational field of individual particles , which makes the deviation from the standard gravity per particle weaker when one keeps adding particles into a system .",
    "this is known as the vainshtein mechanism @xcite , which was first introduced in the context of massive gravity to suppress the extra helicity modes of the massive graviton so as to recover gr in the massless limit .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism works not only in the nonlinear massive gravity @xcite and dgp models , but also in other more general models , such as the galileons @xcite , which are the focus of this paper .",
    "the galileon model is the general name of a class of models whose lagrangians respect the galilean shift symmetry , namely the lagrangian is invariant under the following transformation in the minkowski spacetime , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the galileon field and @xmath5 is a constant four - vector .",
    "if one requires that the field equation contains at most second order derivatives , then there are three ) below for more details ) . ]",
    "possibilities , respectively the cubic , quartic and quintic galileons , named after the highest power of @xmath4 in the lagrangian ( e.g. , the quintic galileon lagrangian contains the fifth power of @xmath4 , quartic galileon fourth and cubic galileon third ; more details are given below ) .",
    "there have been many studies of the astrophysical and cosmological implications of galileon models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , there have recently been several @xmath0-body simulations of these models ( e.g. , ) .",
    "however , so far , nonlinear simulation of the galileon models have been restricted to the dgp and cubic galileon models , which involve up to second order powers of the scalar field derivatives , e.g. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in their field equation .",
    "we emphasise that even for these simple galileon models , those derivative couplings already make the equation highly nonlinear . in the full galileon model",
    ", one can have even higher order derivative coupling terms , such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the quartic galileon model , and we are unaware of any self - consistent simulations of nonlinear structure formation in this case .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite has made a spherical collapse study and found that the highest - order galileon model , the quintic galileon , admits no physical solution to the galileon field in the quasi - static limit except when the matter density perturbation is small .",
    "therefore , the quintic galileon model is not of interest to us here , and this work will focus on the @xmath0-body simulation of the most general model that is still viable under the quasi - static approximation , namely the quartic one . in this work",
    "we develop an extension of the numerical algorithm used in @xcite for the dgp and cubic galileon simulations , and apply it to the quartic galileon model .",
    "this is then implemented in the ecosmog code to carry out the first @xmath0-body simulations of the nonlinear structure formation in this model .",
    "our results show that the nonlinearity due to the high - order derivative couplings plays a very important role in determining the strength of gravity and therefore the clustering of matter , and enable us to quantify the deviations from the standard gravity predictions .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in   [ sect : model ] we briefly describe the quartic galileon model and derive its field equations in the quasi - static and weak - field limits ; we also introduce the attractor tracker solution of the model , which helps us to remove one galileon model parameter , obtain analytical expressions for the background quantities and to simplify the field equations . in   [ sect : equations ] we re - express the field equations in the ramses code unit and derive the discrete versions of these equations which can be solved on a mesh .",
    "we point out that the quartic galileon equation can be considered as a third - order algebraic equation for @xmath11 , and that first analytically solving the latter could greatly simplify the numerical solutions to the former .",
    "a new algorithm is proposed based on this principle , which is shown to work very well for a number of test cases in   [ sect : code_tests ] .",
    "then in   [ sect : cosmo ] we discuss further issues that arise in cosmological simulations , describe the simulations and present our results .",
    "we finally summarise and conclude in   [ sect : summary ] .    throughout the paper",
    "we shall follow the metric convention @xmath12 , and set @xmath13 except in expressions where @xmath14 appears explicitly .",
    "greek indices run over @xmath15 while roman indices run over @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the reduced planck mass and is related to newton s constant , @xmath18 , by @xmath19 .",
    "this section gives a short description of the quartic galileon model and the derivation of its field equations in appropriate limits under which @xmath0-body simulations are usually carried out .",
    "note that @xmath32 are the lagrangian densities for the normal quintessence field with a linear potential .",
    "the remaining three terms , @xmath33 , are characterised by the exponent of @xmath4 which appears in them , e.g. , @xmath34 is called the quintic galileon model because it contains the fifth power of @xmath4 .",
    "likewise , @xmath35 is called the cubic galileon and @xmath36 the quartic galileon .",
    "note , however , that when we talk about the quartic galileon model we generally set @xmath37 , and similarly the quintic model has @xmath38 . @xmath39 is always set to @xmath40 in our study .",
    "nonlinear structure formation for the cubic galileons has been systematically studied in @xcite , which demonstrated that the vainshtein mechanism is very efficient in suppressing the modified gravity on small scales . as for the quintic galileons",
    ", @xcite showed that the strongly nonlinear equation does not admit real physical solutions in regions where the density contrast is higher than @xmath41 ( at least in the quasi - static and weak - field limit ) , and so the model does not merit or support a fully nonlinear study .",
    "consequently , the quartic model is the only cosmologically feasible galileon model that hasnt been studied with @xmath0-body simulations , and this will be the main goal of this paper .    the fully covariant expressions of the galileon energy momentum tensor that the galileon equation are extremely long and we shall not present them here .",
    "interested readers are referred to , e.g. , the appendix of @xcite for the complete formulae . in what follows we",
    "shall only give the simplified versions of these equations under appropriate limits .",
    "the background friedmann and quartic galileon equations are respectively given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is the background density of matter ( radiation is neglected because we consider only the late - time universe throughout this paper ) , @xmath45 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath4 is the background value of the galileon field ( we do not write overbars here to lighten the notation , see below ) . a dot is the physical time derivative .",
    "note that from here on we have made a redefinition of the galileon field @xmath46 so that the new galileon field @xmath4 is dimensionless .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath47 has been used to derive eqs .",
    "( [ eq : friedmann ] , [ eq : eom ] ) .      in @xmath0-body simulations of modified gravity models , we usually work under the quasistatic limit , which means that all time derivatives of the scalar field perturbations are assumed to be small compared with their spatial derivatives ( @xmath48 ) and can therefore be dropped . in the cases of galileon models",
    ", the quasi - static approximation has been shown to work pretty well on small and intermediate scales in the linear perturbation regime @xcite .",
    "for the quartic galileon , we shall in addition assume that the time derivatives of the gravitational potentials are much smaller than their corresponding spatial derivatives : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the newtonian gauge potentials in the metric @xmath51 and @xmath52 denotes derivative with respect to the comoving coordinate @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is the metric of the three - dimensional euclidian space with signature @xmath55 .",
    "in addition to the quasi - static approximation , we also work in the weak - field limit , which amounts to dropping terms such as @xmath56 compared with @xmath57 .",
    "note that relaxing the quasi - static and weak - field approximations will result in many new terms entering the final equations , making them much more difficult to derive or solve .",
    "we will comment more on the implications of these approximations later .    in the rest of the paper",
    ", we use @xmath58 to denote partial spatial derivatives . after some tedious calculation",
    ", we find that the ( 00)-component of the perturbed einstein equation , when the galileon contributions are included , can be written as follows in the quasi - static limit ( some useful expressions are given in appendix  [ appendix : a ] , and note that @xmath59 ) @xmath60\\nonumber\\\\ & & -6\\frac{c_4}{h_0 ^ 4}h\\dot{\\varphi}^3\\nabla^2\\varphi+\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{c_4}{m^6}\\dot{\\varphi}^4\\nabla^2\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that to lighten the notation we choose not to use @xmath61 as the galileon perturbation ; instead , @xmath4 denotes the full galileon field in @xmath62 and its background value in @xmath63 ( the latter is expressed according to the quasi - static approximation , without which the above equation would have been much longer ) .    at this point , it is useful to introduce some new notation .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 can be decomposed into a trace part and a trace - less part in the following way @xmath65 the above equation serves as a definition of the operator @xmath66 , which satisfies @xmath67 . to write down the above decomposition",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath68 is symmetric as partial derivatives commute with one another ( without such a property we would have to add an anti - symmetric part to the decomposition ) .",
    "an advantage of using this decomposition is that , as we shall see below , when we discretise quantities containing @xmath68 on a 3-dimensional mesh , the trace part involves only the central cell and its 6 direct neighbours ( i.e. , the cells with a common face with the central cell ) , while the traceless part involves the 6 direct neighbours and the 12 neighbouring cells with a common edge with the central cell .",
    "indeed , we shall see below that this decomposition guarantees that the central cell only enters the einstein and galileon equations via the quantity @xmath11 , which is why the operator - splitting technique @xcite works for simulations of the dgp model @xcite and the cubic galileon model @xcite .    with the above decomposition",

    "( [ eq : ij_traceless_tracker2 ] ) to eliminate @xmath80 , which makes the galileon equation higher order and therefore more difficult to converge in the numerical solutions .",
    "as none of the above approaches is ideal , we shall follow a more straightforward alternative , namely using the values of @xmath119 directly in the galileon equation . because the galileon field is solved before @xmath119 in the simulation",
    ", this means that we have to utilise @xmath119 from the previous time step to solve the galileon equation in the current step .",
    "this approximation , however , is not a disadvantage of using this method , because    * even if we use the first two methods above , we still need to know either @xmath118 or @xmath139 at the current time step ( which we do not know at the time of solving the galileon equation ) to evaluate @xmath230 and @xmath231 , and therefore some approximations are needed anyway ; * the values of @xmath119 at the previous time step are only needed for the regular simulation mesh , and on refinements we can instead use interpolated values from coarser levels , because the galileon equation on refinements are solved after @xmath119 is obtained on the coarser level .    indeed , we shall discuss later , the error caused by this approximation is small .    in our simulations , we store the values of @xmath119 for the current time step to be used for the next time step .      the standard newton - gauss - seidel relaxation method has been used in all versions of ecosmog , and there is no need to repeat its introduction here .",
    "interested readers are referred to @xcite for more detail .",
    "instead , here we shall only briefly describe the new features of the new code , the most important of which is the convergence criterion .    in simulations of @xmath2 gravity ,",
    "the chameleon , dilaton and symmetron models , and the dgp and cubic galileon models , we have seen very good convergence properties of the scalar field solver : as more relaxation sweeps are done , the residual ( which is the modulus of the difference of the two sides of the scalar field equation ) could become very small ( @xmath232 ) . in the quartic galileon case , due to the higher degree of nonlinearity ( e.g. , terms such as @xmath233 ) , we can not decrease the residual by as much , and below some value the residual starts to oscillate .",
    "the problem is not alleviated if we change the colouring scheme ( i.e. , the order for updating the scalar field in different cells ) , or use other algorithms such as successive over - relaxation .",
    "because the residual at a given refinement level is the root - mean - squared of the residuals for all its cells , this implies that in some cells the scalar field value is not as accurate as in other cells .",
    "we have checked explicitly and found that this happens mostly when some of the terms in the galileon equation ( i.e. , some of the terms specified by @xmath234 ) are much larger than other terms , and this appears only for a small fraction of all the cells ) . ] .",
    "fortunately , one does not have to rely on the residual being extremely small to decide on the convergence of the relaxation method .",
    "when the residual is smaller than the truncation error , which is essentially the numerical discretisation error at a given refinement level , further reducing the residual does not really help because it can not beat the error caused by solving a _",
    "discrete _ version of a _ continuous _ equation @xcite . in our cases ,",
    "when the residual stops decreasing and begins oscillating , it is already at least one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the truncation error  this more than satisfies the convergence criterion advocated by @xcite , namely the residual being smaller than about one third of the truncation error .",
    "therefore , in the simulations , we stop the relaxation in practice when the residual starts to oscillate .",
    "the fact that we do not require the residual to become very small makes the overall performance of the galileon simulations better since , for example , in @xmath2 simulations a lot of time is spent on reducing the residual to below at least @xmath235 .    in what follows",
    ", we will also find that the spatial variation of the galileon field is strongly suppressed in high - density regions , so that its effect on structure formation in these regions is minimal anyway .",
    "the update of particle positions and velocities is done using a second - order midpoint time integration scheme as is implemented in the default ramses code @xcite .",
    "this reduces to standard second - order leapfrog scheme but allows the extra freedom of varying lengths of time steps .",
    "the lengths of time steps are determined by the courant - friedrich - levy stability condition .",
    "since the inclusion of the fifth force in the quartic galileon model amounts to a change of the newtonian potential in standard @xmath1cdm simulations , the above time - integration scheme also works for our simulations provided that the proper total gravitational potential is used .",
    "note that , in cases where gravity is stronger than that in gr , the time steps are made shorter to satisfy the stability condition : this ensures that the accuracy of the time integration is similar to that in ramses @xmath1cdm simulations .",
    "following most previous vainshtein simulations , we shall perform simulations for three different models in this work :    * the _ full quartic galileon _ model ; * the _ linearised galileon _ model , in which all nonlinear terms of the galileon equation and the modified poisson equation are suppressed , such that there is no vainshtein screening ; here the clustering of matter is governed by a scale - independent effective newton constant given by @xmath236 * the so - called _ qcdm _ model , which has the same background expansion history as the full galileon model but in which gravity is not modified .    by simulating the linearised galileon model , one can understand the effect of the vainshtein mechanism , and by working with the qcdm model one picks out the effects of having the galileon background evolution history only .",

    "note however that in this model the matter density is higher than the best - fit @xmath1cdm model for the same data sets , so that even the qcdm model ( i.e. , without any modification of gravity ) gives stronger matter clustering than the latter .    to understand the effect of modified gravity",

    "this makes the model unique and therefore deserving of more detailed study . as this paper",
    "is mainly focused on the methodology , we will undertake such studies in a follow - up paper .      in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] we show the results for the velocity divergence power spectrum , which is defined by @xmath283 where @xmath284 for the velocity divergence field @xmath285 , and @xmath286 denotes the ensemble average .",
    "here we have assumed that the velocity filed is irrotational on the scales of interest , and can be described by the scalar @xmath287 as a pure potential flow .",
    "this assumptions breaks down at small scales , however any potential effects of non - vanishing vorticity are beyond the scope of this work .    to measure the dark matter velocity field and its divergence from the particles positions and velocities , we have used the delaunay tessellation field estimator ( dtfe ) code described in @xcite .",
    "the use of the delaunay tessellation has the advantage that the @xmath288 field calculated using this method is volume - averaged instead of mass - averaged .",
    "it also avoids the problem of empty cells containing no particles , which could appear in direct assignment methods to measure the velocity field @xcite .",
    "the results of @xmath289 show qualitatively similar behaviour and patterns as we saw in the dgp simulations @xcite ( fig .  3 there ) .",
    "in particular , we can see that    * on scales as large as @xmath290mpc@xmath243 , there is already substantial difference between results of the linearised and full simulations , which indicates that the nonlinearity due to the galileon field can affect larger scales for the velocity field ; indeed , this difference is much larger than what was found in the dgp simulations of @xcite , confirming that the model here has stronger nonlinearity ; * at @xmath291mpc@xmath243 , @xmath289 is smaller in the full quartic galileon model than in qcdm , because of the fact that @xmath292 in this regime ; * for @xmath293mpc@xmath243 , the deviation of @xmath289 in the full galileon model from the qcdm result decreases , and at @xmath294 mpc@xmath243 the former can even be slightly larger .",
    "the above results paint a physical picture that in the linearised simulations the velocity field is boosted on all scales , while in the full simulations the situation becomes more complicated : on large scales the velocity divergence is enhanced but not by as much as the linear theory predicts because of the nonlinearity of the quartic galileon model ; on scales corresponding to the infall regions near halos and filaments , the weakened gravitational strength makes the velocity divergence smaller than in the case of standard gravity ; on small scales corresponding to the substructures of halos , the virialisation process is modified by the weaker gravity : judging from the @xmath295 results , one would expect that halos become less concentrated in the full simulations , because their potential is shallower but the particle velocities are not necessarily much lower than in qcdm  this could lead to a more complicated behaviour of the velocity divergence on those scales .    the fact that the velocity field is seriously affected by the nonlinearity on ( supposedly ) linear scales ( @xmath290mpc@xmath243 ) suggests that one should be careful in making conclusions regarding statistics such as the redshift space distortions by applying linear perturbation theory in models like the quartic galileons .",
    "fully consistent nonlinear simulations are essential to draw rigorous conclusions , and we will leave these to future work .",
    "the quartic galileon model is the next higher - order realisation of the vainshtein mechanism to the cubic galileon and dgp models , and the nonlinearity in its field equation is expected to restore gr near massive objects .",
    "previous research has shown that this model could fit the combined cmb , supernovae and bao data very well @xcite , but studies have so far been restricted to the linear perturbation regime .",
    "this work is devoted to the development of the methodology needed to study the nonlinear structure formation in this model . to this end , we first derived the simplified galileon field equation in the quasi - static and weak - field limits , which contains higher - order derivative - couplings of the galileon field than in the cases of the dgp and cubic galileon models .",
    "we then generalised the algorithm for numerically solving the dgp and cubic galileon equations to this model .",
    "the algorithm is based on the splitting of the second - order derivatives of the galileon field @xmath4 into a trace part ( @xmath11 ) and a traceless part ( @xmath296 ) , so that the equation can be considered as a third - order algebraic equation of @xmath11 , the solutions to which can be obtained analytically .",
    "we explained which of the three branches of the solution is the physical one , and discussed the required conditions for the physical solution to be real .",
    "the expression of @xmath11 in terms of the density field and quantities containing @xmath296 enabled us to make a very easy implementation of the gauss - seidel relaxation method to calculate @xmath4 on ( both regular and adaptively refined ) meshes .",
    "various possible numerical issues which are new to the quartic galileon model were also discussed .",
    "our numerical galileon - equation solver was then tested in different matter configurations , such as 1d sine and gaussian density fields and spherical over(under)densities .",
    "we found in all these cases that the galileon field can be accurately solved .",
    "we also identified a problem where no solution can be found for deep spherical underdensities , which is probably because of those terms which had been neglected under the quasi - static and weak - field limits .",
    "as the derivation of the full galileon @xmath0-body equation is extremely complex and therefore beyond the scope of the current work , a simple and approximate cure of this problem was introduced to prevent the simulation from crashing .",
    "the same fix was introduced in the cubic galileon simulations to avoid a similar problem , and was found to work reasonably well @xcite .    to study how large - scale structures can be affected by a quartic galileon field",
    ", we carried out a suite of @xmath0-body simulations , for both the full galileon model and two of its variants under certain simplifying assumptions , with different box sizes and therefore mass ( and force ) resolutions .",
    "these simulations showed an interesting and unique feature of this model , namely it predicts stronger / weaker matter clustering than standard gravity ( i.e. , the qcdm model ) on large / small scales .",
    "the behaviour would be completely different if one artificially suppresses the vainshtein mechanism , such as in our linearised simulations , which show enhancement of the matter clustering on all scales ( and especially at small scales ) .",
    "we ascribed the distinct behaviour of the quartic galileon model to the curvature coupling of the galileon field , which makes the effective newtonian constant , @xmath263 , dependent on time .",
    "similar to the dgp and cubic galileon models , the vainshtein mechanism could efficiently suppress the spatial variations of the galileon field in high - density regions , but the vainshtein mechanism itself does not affect the rescaling of @xmath263 , and thus gr is _ not _ recovered in dense regions .",
    "this also has impacts on the large - scale velocity field , as illustrated by our results on the velocity divergence power spectrum .        the galileon models ( except for the cubic one ) have been shown to fit the cmb , supernovae and bao data rather well @xcite",
    "however , linear theory predicts that these models generally strongly enhance the growth of structures on linear scales @xcite , which can be in tension with observations unless the galaxy bias is close to @xmath297 on those scales ( @xmath298 @xmath165mpc@xmath243 ) .",
    "one then wonders if the nonlinearity can suppress this enhancement at @xmath299mpc@xmath243 .    from the studies",
    "so far , we know the following :    * @xmath0-body simulations of @xcite showed that for the best - fit cubic galileon model , the nonlinearity does not affect scales larger than @xmath299mpc@xmath243 ; note that this model causes a large excess of the integrated sachs wolfe effect , which makes it disfavoured by cmb data @xcite ; * @xmath0-body simulations in this work showed that nonlinearity can influence larger scales than it does in the cubic case  as an example , at @xmath300mpc@xmath243 linear theory and simulations of the full model predict @xmath301 and @xmath302 enhancements of matter clustering respectively .",
    "but this still does not provide enough suppression of the linear matter power spectrum on large scales to make it comparable to the prediction of the best - fitting @xmath1cdm model ( note however that the difference from @xmath1cdm is mainly due to the different matter density and expansion history than the galileon models , rather than the law of gravitational interaction between particles @xcite ) . *",
    "the study of spherical collapse in @xcite demonstrated that the quintic galileon model admits no real physical solutions for spherical tophat overdensities whose density contrasts are higher than @xmath303 at late times .",
    "as physical solutions do exist for the linearised quintic equation , it implies that nonlinearity has a more drastic effect on the quintic model than it does on the cubic and quartic models . + we suspect that even if the approximations used to derive the quintic field equations are dropped ( which is a highly challenging task itself ) there is still no guarantee that this model has real physical solutions everywhere . as a result , we decide not to investigate this model further .",
    "therefore , the nonlinearity becomes more important moving from the cubic to the quintic galileons .",
    "furthermore , one should bear in mind the problem in low - density regions identified for the cubic @xcite and quartic ( @xcite and this work ) cases , which is another consequence of such nonlinearity .",
    "all these indicate that linear perturbation studies of the galileon models can only be trusted for very large scales and/or very small density perturbations ( e.g. , the cmb ) , and that for most other cases fully consistent nonlinear investigations are essential .",
    "the time variation of @xmath263 in high - density regions is another important feature of the quartic ( and quintic ) galileon model .",
    "this effect has been previously found in @xcite and in a slightly different context in @xcite .",
    "if this conclusion also applies locally , such as in the solar system , then the quartic galileon model would be stringently constrained by local bounds on the time variation of @xmath18 , @xmath304 @xcite , such as those from the lunar laser ranging experiments @xcite . however , without a rigorous study , it is not clear how reliable our calculation , which is performed in a cosmological setup , can be used to make predictions about the behavior of the model in much smaller systems @xcite .",
    "it is clear that more work is needed to clarify this point .",
    "admittedly , the above conclusions are made for the best - fit galileon models using the cmb , supernovae and bao data , and they can change if one adopts other galileon and cosmological parameters . however , as the cmb and expansion data has been so powerful in constraining the galileon parameters @xcite , there seems to be no point to consider parameters which are drastically different from the best - fit values , and within the parameter space allowed by cmb data , we doubt that things would change fundamentally ( for example , @xcite checked that the problem of no physical solutions for the quintic galileon model persists for other reasonable parameter choices ) .      the numerical algorithm proposed in this work to solve",
    "the quartic galileon equation is an extension of that for the dgp and cubic galileon simulations in @xcite , following the spirit of the operator - splitting technique @xcite . by splitting @xmath64 to @xmath11 and @xmath296 , and solving the resulting third - order algebraic equation for @xmath11",
    ", the equation can be reduced to the form @xmath305 , the right - hand side of which contains complicated terms for the derivatives of @xmath4 so that in principle these terms depend on @xmath4 .",
    "however , when the equation is discretised on a mesh , it turns out that the right - hand side no longer contains @xmath166 , which is the value of @xmath4 in the central cell to be solved by the relaxation method .",
    "therefore , as far as the relaxation method is concerned , the discrete version of @xmath306 is indeed a _ linear _ equation for @xmath166 , making the numerical implementation straightforward . since the right - hand side of this equation ( i.e. , the ` @xmath307 ' ) does not contain @xmath166 , we do not even need a closed - form expression of it : all we need is its numerical values for all mesh cells .",
    "this implies that the algorithm here can be generalised to even higher - order theories , such as the _ quintic _ galileon model , in which @xmath11 satisfies a sixth - order algebraic equation @xcite and thus does not have analytical solution ( this is different from the cubic and quartic cases ) . of course",
    ", as the equation gets more nonlinear , we expect that the convergence properties will be worse in such higher - order theories , just as they are worse in the quartic than in the cubic models .",
    "we have seen that the complexity of the field equations in the quartic galileon model requires us to make certain approximations , but is is worth stressing that the approximations we made are not the only possibilities and one can follow alternatives as well .",
    "an example is the treatment of @xmath80 in the galileon field equation : although there are different ways to do this , none of them is ideal .",
    "the approach we followed is a practical one , in which we took the values of @xmath119 from the previous time step as a source term for the galileon equation at the current step .",
    "we can think of other variants of this approach , e.g. , the following steps    1 .",
    "split @xmath80 into @xmath308 and the terms involving derivatives of @xmath4 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ij_traceless_tracker2 ] ) , 2 .   put this splitting into the galileon equation , which now contains @xmath308 ( and no longer @xmath80 ) , as well as a few more ( higher - order ) @xmath4-derivative terms , 3 .",
    "solve @xmath120 before solving the galileon equation so that when the latter is being solved the value of @xmath308 at the _ current _ step is already known , and 4 .",
    "use the previous - step values of the @xmath4-derivative terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ij_traceless_tracker2 ] ) in the galileon equation ( which then does _ not _ become higher - order ) .    as not all the @xmath4-derivative terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ij_traceless_tracker2 ] ) are higher - order , one can even decide to absorb some of them , e.g. @xmath309 , into a redefinition of the @xmath132-coefficients in the galileon equation .",
    "note that such a modified implementation will likely also change how the total gravitational force is computed ( as @xmath119 is not being computed it this ) , and one then needs to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : force ] ) to calculate the gravitational force .",
    "we tested this and found that the result only slightly differs from that in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] for @xmath310 ( the difference is significantly smaller than the 1@xmath311 error bars therein ) . as the method described in the main text requires us to store fewer quantities , it is more memory efficient and therefore better for large simulations .",
    "this paper is devoted to the development of methodology , and therefore does not contain an in - depth analysis of the effect the quartic galileon field may have on different cosmological observables . because a distinct feature of this model is that gravity is strengthened on large scales ( or in low - density regions ) and weakened on small scales ( or in dense regions ) , we expect that it could have a big impact on the formation and properties of dark matter halos ( such as the halo concentrations ) .",
    "on the other hand , we also show that the velocity field is more strongly affected by the vainshtein mechanism , which can have important effects on the redshift space distortions .",
    "it would thus be of interests to run high - resolution or large - box simulations for this model in the future , and study these issues in greater details .",
    "moreover , the development of the excursion set approach @xcite provides a powerful complementary tool to analyse nonlinear structure formation in the quartic galileon models .",
    "its predictions for the halo mass function and halo bias etc . can be tested with high - resolution simulations . with some extra work",
    ", one can also build up a halo model @xcite for the quartic galileons , which will enable us to predict other observables , such as the matter power spectrum , and compare with the full simulations .",
