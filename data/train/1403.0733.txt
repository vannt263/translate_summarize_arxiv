    "exploring the origin of the matter and anti - matter asymmetry of our universe , its production mechanism and time evolution are very important issues . in many scenarios of baryogenesis",
    "@xcite @xcite and leptogenesis @xcite , baryon number @xmath0 and lepton number @xmath1 interactions are required so that the primordial asymmetry of the particle number can be generated .",
    "after it is generated , the particle number violating interactions must be frozen .",
    "otherwise , the primordial asymmetry created will be washed out . in this",
    "regards , in the context of leptogenesis @xcite , there are studies of the effect @xmath2 operator of the mass dimension @xmath3 on the primordial @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) asymmetries . if the coefficient of the operator is too large , the primordial asymmetries will be completely washed out .",
    "since the same operator generates the majorana mass matrix for light neutrinos at low energy , constraints on its elements are obtained from the condition that a leptogenesis scenario succeeds .",
    "one can also argue whether they are compatible with neutrino masses , lepton mixing matrix , and the experimental limit on the neutrino - less double beta decay rate @xcite .",
    "we introduce a scalar model with particle number violating mass terms to investigate the time dependence of the particle number density in expanding universe , where the scale factor has arbitrary time dependence . in numerical study",
    ", we focus on the case that the scale factor grows exponentially and study how a given initial particle number asymmetry evolves under the influence of the particle number violating mass terms and the expansion .",
    "the scalar field is written in terms of a complex klein gordon field and one can identify the time component of u(1 ) current as a particle number density .",
    "baryogenesis with a complex field has been discussed in several literatures @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where the time derivative of the phase of the scalar is identified with the baryon number density .",
    "we adopt the non - equilibrium field theory which has been developed in the literatures @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite so that one can study the time evolution of the expectation value of the particle number density .",
    "we employ functional method since one can naturally extend the present study so that interactions and condensates are incorporated .",
    "the present work , therefore , serves as a starting point when we include interactions besides the terms quadratic with respect to the field . despite of no interactions beyond quadratic terms , under the environment of the expanding universe ,",
    "the initial condition with non - zero asymmetry and the particle number violating mass terms lead to non - trivial time evolution of the particle and anti - particle asymmetry . in the expectation value ,",
    "the weight of each state is specified by a density matrix .",
    "the density matrix is written with the grand canonical form and it is specified with temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the functional form for the density matrix with non - zero chemical potential is constructed explicitly . in our study , the primordial asymmetry of the particle number density is given by choosing the value and the sign of the chemical potential .",
    "we derive formulae for the expectation value of the particle number density in an analytic form . for exponentially expanding universe ,",
    "the formulae are written with hankel functions .",
    "the various limiting cases , e.g. , the case of the vanishing and/or small expansion rate and the case for vanishing particle number violating mass , etc .",
    ", can be easily obtained . in numerical study",
    ", one can change the coefficient of the particle number violating mass term and the expansion rate of the universe .",

    "there are two typical cases .",
    "when the chemical potential is smaller than the mass of the complex scalar , besides the damping effect due to the expansion , the interference of contributions from various momenta also reduces the particle number density . on the other hand , when the chemical potential is larger than the scalar mass , the contribution from a certain momentum region is dominant .",
    "the resulting particle number density oscillates with a definite frequency in addition to the damping .",
    "the phenomena of the single frequency dominance is related to the fact that the distribution function for the complex scalar boson has a pole at some momentum .",
    "in contrast to the case with small chemical potential , the interference does not occur and the density continues to oscillate over the time until the density itself is suppressed by the expansion of the universe .",
    "the phenomena of the decoherence with the interference and the coherence with large chemical potential will have some impact on concrete scenarios of matter and anti - matter problem .",
    "the decoherence effect has some impact on the dark matter problem . in the scenario of the asymmetric dark matter ,",

    "the matter and anti - matter oscillation , if it exists , can change the amount of the dark matter @xcite , @xcite .",
    "if the decoherence occurs and the primordial asymmetry is washed out , the amount of the matter becomes nearly equal to the one of the anti - matter .",
    "the pair annihilation of matter and anti - matter leads to the further reduction of the dark matter .",
    "let us consider the case that the sign of the primordial particle number asymmetry is positive and is the same as that of the present asymmetry .",
    "suppose the particle number violating mass term is so small that the sign of the asymmetry has been remained as positive .",
    "if this is the case , the strength of the particle number violating mass term will be determined with cosmological observation on the difference between the primordial asymmetry and the present one .",
