    "the key to all matter - wave interferometry are coherent beamsplitters which divide each incident wave into separated wavelets with well - defined phase relations @xcite .",
    "while modern atom interferometry often utilizes the momentum recoil of resonant laser light to split the atomic wave @xcite , mechanical masks @xcite as well as optical phase @xcite or absorption @xcite gratings can also be used to divide a matter - wave front .",
    "since the universality of mechanical gratings is compromised by the van der waals ( vdw ) potential it is important to ask to what extent it is possible to minimize this interaction by reducing the grating thickness .",
    "this technological feat - to actually create free - standing nanogratings in even a single layer of atoms @xcite - is accompanied by the fundamental question whether the path of a massive particle through the multi - slit array will become significantly entangled with the mechanical motion of the recoiling ultra - thin structure .",
    "if this were the case we would expect to observe loss of the interference contrast .",
    "using a focused ion beam we were able to mill a periodic diffraction grating into a single layer of graphene that was suspended over a silicon nitride ( sin@xmath1 ) membrane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gratings]a , see appendix sec.[app : gratings ] for details ) .",
    "the nanoribbons ( @xmath2  nm wide ) were written with a period of @xmath3  nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gratings]c ) .",
    "they spontaneously transform into carbon nanoscrolls @xcite , here with a diameter down to @xmath4  nm ( fig .",
    "1b and appendix sec.[app : scrolls ] ) . for shorter grating bars scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) reveals , however , stable flat single - layer graphene structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gratings]e ) .",
    "we were also able to write gratings into bilayer graphene suspended across a lacey carbon mesh ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gratings]f ) .",
    "the second layer of carbon atoms suppresses the formation of nanoscrolls entirely on the observed scale .",
    "bilayer graphene may also form bonds at open cuts and thus expose closed edges and a thicker wall than expected based on the number of layers alone @xcite .",
    "we compare these structures finally to an insulating structure of almost identical thickness , the carbonaceous biphenyl membrane @xcite ( also on lacey carbon , fig .",
    "[ fig : gratings]g , ) and reference all images to the diffraction of molecules at @xmath5  nm thick silicon nitride ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gratings]h ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : gratings ] demonstrates that stable structures can be written even into atomically thin membranes . the diffraction pattern behind a purely absorptive periodic mask - _ i.e. _ without any phase modulation  can be described as the convolution of two contributions : the diffraction at each single slit of width @xmath6 and the diffraction at an array of infinitely thin slits of period @xmath7 .",
    "the fringe positions are well described by wave theory .",
    "the fringe amplitudes are modulated by the single - slit diffraction pattern . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : overview](a ) - ( e ) , we see immediately vast differences in the diffraction at geometrically similar gratings . for @xmath5  nm thick silicon nitride ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overview]a ) we observe interference up to the @xmath8th diffraction order , which can only be understood if we complement the quantum wave model by the assumption that the position - dependent phases accumulated in the presence of vdw forces alter the effective transmission function . approximating this interaction by reducing",
    "the effective slit width @xcite ( see appendix sec.[app : kirchhoff ] ) allows us to estimate the strength of the vdw interactions . for silicon nitride the analysis yields an effective slit width of @xmath9  nm - a reduction of the open width by @xmath10 .",
    "this influence is strongly reduced for the single - layer graphene grating , the probably thinnest conceivable grating ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overview]e , @xmath11 ) .",
    "as expected this leads to a strong suppression of all diffraction orders beyond the first one .",
    "this holds true - and even more so - for gratings made from nanoscrolls ( @xmath12 ) , which maximize the opening fraction , _",
    "i.e. _ the ratio of slit width to period .",
    "in contrast to that , the diffraction pattern both behind the carbonaceous biphenyl membrane ( @xmath13 ) and the bilayer graphene ( @xmath14 ) show substantial populations up to the fifth diffraction order .",
    "this indicates a stronger influence of the attractive van der waals force .",
    "while the carbonaceous biphenyl membrane should be an insulator , the bilayer sample is conducting .",
    "however , both imprint similar phase shifts onto the transmitted molecules .",
    "we attribute the remaining van der waals forces in particular also to the lacey carbon support structure which is thicker ( up to @xmath15  nm ) and spatially less well controlled than the sin@xmath1 support of the other ultra - thin gratings .",
    "the central result of our diffraction experiments is the observation of high - contrast interference for all gratings , where the contrast reaches its maximum when the interference minima approach the zero ( background ) level .",
    "it is the absence of signal in these minima which contradicts any classical expectation the most .",
    "our result relates to a thought experiment between bohr and einstein who elucidated the role of decoherence in double slit diffraction @xcite .",
    "einstein predicted that the observer should be capable of extracting which - path information from the recoil that the double slit receives upon diffraction of a particle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : born ] ) . invoking heisenberg s uncertainty relation ,",
    "bohr was able to demonstrate , however , that the recoil imparted by the diffracted particles remains within the momentum uncertainty of the grating if this is well positioned .",
    "different recent studies have realized the probably smallest double slits and analogs to this einstein - bohr debate using diatomic molecules as the diffraction elements in a photoionization process @xcite .",
    "they were destroyed in the diffraction process and therefore were capable of carrying away path information .",
    "our carbon nanostructures are probably the thinnest durable realization of the bohr - einstein idea .",
    "these atomically thin membranes are flexible but they last for months and survive the diffraction of millions of molecules .",
    "the observed full contrast shows that coherence prevails , which we interpret as an indication that the momentum exchange with the grating remains within the intrinsic momentum uncertainty of the grating bars ( see appendix [ app : heisenberg ] ) @xcite .",
    "hence , diffraction does not lead to a loss of fringe visibility even though it can cause a sizable matter - wave ( vdw ) phase shift .",
    "graphene gratings are ten times thinner than any other beamsplitter for atoms , molecules or clusters before and they are four orders of magnitude thinner than the width of a typical laser grating @xcite .",
    "our results on single - layer graphene are the best approach with regard to the diffraction of high - mass molecules at nanomechanical gratings , since they show that the effect of molecule - surface interactions can be substantially reduced , even though they do not eliminate them entirely .",
    "this property makes graphene nanogratings also appealing for use with other kinds of matter - waves .",
    "the reduced phase components may enable new coherence experiments with slow ions or anti - matter @xcite .",
    "it will also be interesting to explore atomically thin but insulating 2d sheets like boron nitride or molybdenum disulfide , in the future . even though van der waals forces in thick gratings can be prohibitive for high - mass diffraction",
    ", they can also serve a purpose in metrology : our experiments show that a thick material grating ( sin@xmath16 , fig .",
    "[ fig : overview]a ) can act as a large momentum transfer beamsplitter . if we were to calibrate the momentum exchange between the extreme diffraction orders ( @xmath17 order for @xmath18  nm ) in units of the photon momentum ( @xmath19 ) that is usually imparted in state - of - the - art beamsplitters @xcite for ( rubidium ) atoms , we see that the diffraction at our nanogratings amounts to @xmath20 .",
    "photolithography can reliably provide thick gratings with a periodicity of better than @xmath21  nm over large areas @xcite .",
    "stable thick membranes with narrow slits are predicted to provide a momentum transfer even beyond @xmath22  @xmath19 .",
    "finally , our work shows that path - decoherence close to material gratings is still negligible in all settings discussed here .",
    "this applies in particular for the bohr - einstein gedankenexperiment .",
    "even the conceivably thinnest durable mechanical grating is still sufficiently massive and sufficiently localized not to encode sizable recoil - information .",
    "the intrinsic momentum uncertainty of each grating bar is larger than the recoil imparted on each diffracted molecule ( see appendix [ app : heisenberg ] ) .",
    "this holds for all particles , independent of their mass , as long as we can keep their de broglie wave - length , _",
    "i.e. _ their momentum , the same .",
    "for instance , quantum diffraction of insulin molecules seems conceivable once we can provide a directed molecular beam of about @xmath23 m/s velocity .",
    "finally , it will also be intriguing to explore the role of quantum friction and path - decoherence @xcite which may become particularly relevant for polar molecules in the future .",
