    "non - abelian gauge theories , and in particular qcd , are nowadays fairly well understood in the short - distance ( large - momentum ) regime where asymptotic freedom allows reliable calcuations within perturbation theory . on the other end of the scale , in the long - distance ( low - momentum ) domain ,",
    "fundamental unanswered questions remain , linked intimately to the phenomenon of confinement ( or the lack of detailed knowledge thereof ) , and posing severe infrared problems that present a tough challenge for developing adequate non - perturbative methods to perform practical calculations .",
    "whereas the non - perturbative effects on qcd green functions are small when all relevant momenta are large compared to the inverse confinement length , the properties of the vacuum , the dynamics of the qcd phase transition , or the formation of color - neutral hadronic excitations from colored quark and gluon fluctuations , are completely dominated by the non - perturbative infrared physics . although lattice simulations provide to date the most rigorous non - perturbative studies of qcd , they suffer in one way or another from finite lattice size effects and violation of translational or rotational invariance .",
    "moreover , the continuum limit of results obtained on a discrete euclidean space lattice is a difficult problem itself .",
    "therefore , it is clear that non - perturbative methods , formulated in continuous space and maintaining the symmetries of translations and rotations , are of fundamental need to complement insight into the infrared properties of qcd .",
    "such a method has been developed @xcite during the last few years and has found diverse applications @xcite .",
    "it embodies the concept of the _ average effective action _ in continuous euclidean or minkowski space within the renormalization - group framework of quantum field theory .",
    "the basic idea is to study the theory within a volume @xmath0 and effectively integrate out all quantum fluctuations that can be localized within that volume , i.e. , fluctuations with squared momentum @xmath1 larger than @xmath2 .",
    "the _ average effective action _",
    "@xmath3 is formulated as a functional integral over the microscopic quantum fields , and can be shown to be equal to the usual effective action @xmath4 for macroscopically averaged fields . :",
    "on distance scales @xmath5 the particle appears as an elementary object , but as one increases the resolution to shorter distances by a larger @xmath6 , excitations with wavelengths @xmath7 reveal themselves as a substructure of the original quasi - particle .",
    "vice versa , a decrease of resolution by lowering @xmath8 , averages over fluctuations with longer wavelengths , and yields a larger quasi - particle . loosely speaking , in the extreme short - distance limit @xmath9 , the quasi - particle would be , for instance , a single elementary bare gluon , while in the opposite limit of inifinite volume , @xmath10 , the quasi - particle would correspond to our universe .",
    "the variation of the the scale @xmath8 therefore controls which , and how much , physics one includes in the panorama . ]",
    "the vacuum properties are obtained in the limit @xmath10 where the volume @xmath11 tends to infinity . in this paper , however , we are interested in the non - perturbative infrared behavior of gluons propagating in an unconfined quarkless world .",
    "the volume of such an idealized colored world can not , of course , be infinite , since in reality confinement limits it to be of the size of a hadronic state @xmath12 @xmath13 . hence ,",
    "as we ignore the existence of the qcd phase transition between the colored and the hadronic world , we must cut out the long - distance hadronic physics beyond distances of order 1 fm , and need to restrict @xmath8 to be larger than the mass scale of the qcd phase transition : @xmath14 as we shall see , the introduction of a new scale @xmath8 into the theory is intimately related to the standard renormalization program of qcd , in which one needs to introduce a mass scale at which the green functions are normalized ( since they are not normalizable at zero momentum , due to the infrared divergence ) .",
    "the dependence of the average effective action @xmath3 on the variation of the scale @xmath8 is controlled by an exact non - perturbative evolution equation @xcite , which is very sensitive to the infrared properties .",
    "it is of the generic form @xmath15 \\ ; \\label{ee}\\ ] ] where the kernel @xmath16 depends explicitly only on the ( exact ) 2-point function @xmath17 , but not on higher - order green functions ( which however implicitly enter in determining the 2-point function ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath3 approaches the classical action in the ultraviolet limit @xmath9 and becomes the usual effective action in the infrared limit @xmath18 .",
    "a solution to the evolution equation ( [ ee ] ) therefore interpolates between the ( short - distance ) classical action and the ( long - distance ) effective action . since @xmath19 generates the @xmath8 dependent one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) green functions @xmath20 ( such as the inverse propagator for @xmath21 , or the vertex functions for @xmath22 ) , the evolution equation for @xmath23 is equivalent to an infinite set of corresponding equations for the 1pi functions @xmath20 , which are the differential version of the well - known dyson - schwinger equations @xcite , however with an additional infrared cut - off given by @xmath8 .",
    "just as in the case of the infinite number of dyson - schwinger equations , a truncation to a finite number of coupled equations is unavoidable , if one wishes to find an explicit , but approximate solution .      the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the powerful potential of the average effective action @xmath3 and its evolution equation by studying the simplest non - trivial object in qcd without quarks , namely the gluon propagator .",
    "since the gluon propagator @xmath24 is related to the inverse of the 2-point function @xmath17 , we can obtain from the evolution equation for @xmath3 a corresponding equation for @xmath24 , which determines how the propagator changes as the scale @xmath8 is lowered from some large initial value in the ultraviolet all the way into the deep infrared regime .",
    "unfortunately , the evolution equation for @xmath24 contains in addition the unknown 3-gluon and 4-gluon vertex functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are themselves determined by similar , but even more complex equations , involving further higher - order functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and so forth .",
    "however , by working within the class of axial gauges , the evolution equation for the propagator becomes remarkably simple ( at least formally ) , because the exact propagator is just the bare propagator times a renormalization function @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the evolution equation ( [ ee ] ) translates to an evolution equation for @xmath29 , @xmath31 \\ ; , \\label{ez}\\ ] ] where the kernel @xmath32 explicitly depends on the exact propagator @xmath24 and the exact 3- and 4-gluon vertex functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the class of axial gauges , it is furthermore possible to project out all contributions of 4-gluon vertex functions , so that the remaining unknown object is the exact 3-gluon vertex .",
    "the latter can be eliminated by exploiting the gauge symmetry properties of qcd , in particular the slavnov - taylor identities , which provide a constraint equation between the 3-gluon vertex @xmath25 and the propagator @xmath24 .",
    "the strategy is then to construct an ansatz for @xmath25 in terms of @xmath24 such that this constraint equation is identically satisfied . as a result ,",
    "one arrives at an evolution equation for @xmath24 in terms of the propagator alone , which must be solved as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the crucial point of success in this program is the choice for @xmath25 .",
    "although constrained by gauge symmetry , this choice is hardly unique . in the present paper",
    "we construct a particularly simple ansatz , since our main motivation is to illustrate the concept and the techniques involved .",
    "an important point that one should bear in mind throughout is , that the gluon propagator @xmath33 , in general , is a gauge - dependent object . only in the ultraviolet regime ( @xmath34 ) , where asymptotic freedom is approached , it reduces to a gauge - independent form as given by the perturbative one - loop formula @xcite , in the infrared domain ( @xmath35 ) , on the other hand , confinement should manifest itself in the behavior of the gluon propagator , but here the gauge - dependence foils an unambiguous assignment of confinement effects . yet",
    ", the fact that the propagator is gauge - dependent does not imply that it does not contain physics ; rather , it is that the physics is obscure and difficult to extract .    because of this problem it is desirable to relate the gluon propagator to gauge - invariant quantities , for example the wilson loop or the gluon distribution function of hadrons measured in experiments .",
    "the latter is intimately connected with the spectral density of gluon modes in the propagator .",
    "therefore the evolution equation for the propagator can be transcribed , as we shall show , into a corresponding evolution equation for the gluon distribution function . indeed , in the regime where the longitudinal ( or energy ) component of @xmath36 is much larger than the invariant @xmath1 , one recovers the famous dglap equation @xcite , the perturbative evolution equation for the gluon distribution function .",
    "such a physical scenario is realized , for example , certain hard processes occurring in high - energy hadron collisions or deeply inelastic lepton hadron scattering where a hard gluon can be knocked out and initiate a gluon jet with @xmath37 that evolves by means of fluctuating ( real and virtual ) gluonic offspring towards lower and lower momenta .      a large body of work concerning non - perturbative analyses of the gluon propagator exists in the literature @xcite , which may be subdivided into analytical and lattice studies .",
    "most analytical studies were carried out by attempting to solve the dyson - schwinger equation for the gluon propagator in pure su(3 ) gauge theory without quarks , and in various covariant and non - covariant gauges , for example in the landau gauge @xcite , the temporal and spacelike axial gauge @xcite , and the light - cone gauge @xcite .",
    "the non - covariant axial and light - cone gauges have the advantage that they are ghost - free and involve only the physical gluon degrees of freedom , whereas in covariant gauges one faces a complex coupling between gluon and ghost variables . on the other hand , the structure of the propagator is more complicated in the non - covariant gauges . in either case ,",
    "approximate solutions for the gluon propagator obtained in the literature from the dyson - schwinger equation vary widely @xcite in the infrared behavior of the gluon propagator , whereas the large - momentum behavior is dictated by the well - known perturbative result .",
    "predictions for the dependence of the propagator in the small - momentum limit include an infrared enhancement @xmath38 or @xmath39 , infrared constant @xmath40 , or infrared vanishing @xmath41 .",
    "recall however , that the gluon propagator is a gauge - dependent object , so that these very different results are not , necessarily , contradicting each other .",
    "lattice studies are at present equally obsure , since here ( in addition to the gauge - dependence ) finite lattice size effects make it difficult to penetrate the deep infrared where the gluon wavelength becomes close to or larger than the linear lattice length . there have been a number of lattice simulations of the gluon propagator @xcite , all of which used a fixed lattice landau gauge , and thus are plagued by gribov ambiguities that can lead to significant systematic errors .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that fits to the lattice results to date are not unique and consequently do not allow , at present , for a definite conclusion regarding the infrared behavior of the gluon propagator .",
    "nevertheless , viewed as a whole , these studies seem to suggest that the landau - gauge gluon propagator is finite and non - zero at @xmath42 , although a propagator that vanishes at @xmath42 has also been claimed @xcite to be consistent .      a roadmap of our approach to arrive at a solution for the gluon propagator within the framework of the average effective action may be given by the following list of conceptual steps :    1 .",
    ": :    we consider the pure su(3 ) gauge theory without quarks in minkowski    space , and from the very beginning we choose to work in the class of    axial gauges .",
    "2 . : :    we start from the corresponding vacuum persistence amplitude    @xmath43 , which allows us to separate out the ghost    contribution so that in effect we deal with a ghost - free theory    involving solely the gauge fields .",
    ": :    the generating functional @xmath44 is then extended to    a scale - dependent version @xmath45 by including an    infrared regulating source term    @xmath46    that is quadratic in the gauge fields @xmath47 and    depends on the momentum scale @xmath8 , such that only    quantum fluctuations with momenta @xmath48 are    included and the limit @xmath49 recovers the    full theory .",
    ": :    from @xmath45 we obtain then the corresponding    scale - dependent effective action @xmath50 which    generates the one - particle irreducible @xmath51-point functions    @xmath52 , such as the inverse propagator ,    the 3-gluon and 4-gluon vertex functions .",
    "all of which explicitly    depend on the cut - off scale @xmath8 .",
    "5 . : :    subtracting from @xmath50 the infrared regulator    @xmath53 , and averaging over all gauge field    configurations with in the effective volume    @xmath54 , we arrive at the average    effective action @xmath3 .",
    "differentiation of @xmath3 with respect    its to @xmath8 dependence leads the to the desired exact    evolution equation .",
    ": :    from the evolution equation for    @xmath19    we then project out the quadratic term    @xmath17 that is related to the    inverse gluon propagator .",
    "after decomposing the tensor structure of    the inverse propagator , we obtain a set of coupled equations for two    independent scalar functions , @xmath55 and    @xmath56 .",
    ": :    next we focus our attention to the light - cone gauge , a special case of    the axial gauges , in which the function @xmath55 drops    out , so that we are left with a single evolution equation for the    dimensionless function @xmath57",
    ".    moreover , all 4-gluon vertex contributions can be eliminated , and    consequently only the 3-gluon vertex function survives in the    determination of @xmath29 .",
    ": :    by constructing a specific ansatz for the 3-gluon vertex function that    obeys the constraint of the slavnov - taylor identity for the gluon    propagator @xmath24 , we obtain a closed equation    for the @xmath24 .",
    "the formal solution of this final    evolution equation is simply    @xmath58 ,    where @xmath59 is the bare propagator .",
    "9 . : :    the remaining integration of the final evolution equation for    @xmath29 must be done numerically , but in the    ultraviolet and infrared limits , we are able to extract analytical    solutions , which depend ( aside from the gluon momentum    @xmath36 ) on the scale @xmath8 . in the limit    @xmath10",
    "one obtains then from    @xmath60 the full gluon propagator in    the light - cone gauge ,    @xmath61 .",
    ": :    in its spectral representation , the gluon propagator can be related to    the gauge - independent gluon distribution function    @xmath62 through the renormalization function    @xmath63 , and the evolution equation for    @xmath29 can be transcribed into a corresponding    evolution equation for @xmath64 . in the high - momentum limit",
    "we    recover the perturbative dglap evolution equation , and we find that    our solution coincides with the perturbative result .",
    "although the full solution to the our evolution equation for the gluon propagator @xmath65 in the light - cone gauge requires a numerical analysis , we are able to arrive at analytical solutions for @xmath29 in the extreme limits @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the former case , the _ ultraviolet limit _ , we obtain : @xmath68 on the other end of the energy scale , in the _ infrared limit _ , the leading behavior turns out to be : @xmath69 the corresponding limiting behavior of the actual gluon propagator then follows as : @xmath70 the ultraviolet behavior is consistent with asymptotic freedom , corresponding to a screening of the color charge due to @xmath71 .",
    "the infrared solution would , on the other hand , correspond to a linearly rising potential @xmath72 as @xmath73 , in accordance with the phenomenological picture of confinement .",
    "these results are certainly rather qualitative , firstly , because the inclusion of quark degrees of freedom which we left out here , may alter the details of the infrared behavior and , secondly , because the weakest point of our analysis is the aforementioned _ ansatz _ for the 3-gluon vertex function , which may not be all that good in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "but even for our specific ansatz , an exact numerical solution of the evolution equation for the propagator needs to be carried out before more robust conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the reminder of the paper is structured in accordance with the above list of procedural steps :    in sect .",
    "ii , we recall the necessary basics of the functional formalism , which we then extend to its scale(@xmath8)-dependent analogue . the effective action @xmath74 for this scale - dependent functional formulation , obtained as usual , is then related to the average effective action @xmath3 , which is the generating functional for the green functions in the presence of the cut - off @xmath8 .",
    "we derive the desired exact evolution equation for the change of @xmath3 with a variation of @xmath8 .    sect .",
    "iii is devoted to applying the formalism to the evolution of the gluon propagator @xmath75 .",
    "we first derive , from the fundamental evolution equation for @xmath3 , the general equations that govern the @xmath8-variation of the propagator .",
    "next we restrict ourselves to the light - cone gauge , and arrive at a considerably simpler , single evolution equation for the renormalization function @xmath29 , the formal solution of which is equivalent to the solution of the gluon propagator in the light - cone gauge .    in sect .",
    "iv , we take pragmatical steps to actually solve the evolution equation , subject to a necessary assumption about the form of the 3-gluon vertex function .",
    "the final master equation for the renormalization function @xmath29 and hence for the propagator @xmath76 , can then be solved in closed form , and we are able to obtain the above - quoted results in the ultraviolet and the infrared limits .",
    "a phenomenological formula for the propagator that may be useful for parton model applications , is constructed by interpolating between the two extreme limits .",
    "v applies the results for renormalization function @xmath29 to illustrate two important phenomenological connections with experimentally measurable quantities , namely the qcd running coupling @xmath77 and the gluon distribution function @xmath78 .",
    "first , we infer from @xmath29 the running of the coupling @xmath77 , using standard renormalization group arguments , and then we relate @xmath29 via the spectral density @xmath79 of the gluon propagator , the gluon distribution function @xmath80 and its evolution equation .",

    "appendix b recalls some basic formulae of the functional formalism in qcd , and provides a list of relevant green functions and vertices . in appendix c ,",

    "either of these conditions , one arrives the very simple forms for ( [ x13 ] ) and ( [ x14 ] ) : @xmath768 @xmath769 one sees that now the effect of gluon self - interactions are encoded multiplicatively , so that we can express both @xmath24 and @xmath239 as the bare counterparts @xmath317 , respectively @xmath770 , modulo a scalar renormalization function @xmath771 , @xmath772 where the renormalization function @xmath63 is related to the gluon self - energy @xmath764 by @xmath773 with initial condition at @xmath774 , @xmath775 so to ensure that the full propagator equals the bare one in the asymptotic freedom regime when @xmath776 .",
    "in this appendix we discuss in more detail the relation between the gluon propagator @xmath24 and its spectral density @xmath79 , as introduced in sec . 3 , eq . ( [ spectral ] ) .",
    "recall , that the gluon propagator is formally defined , according to ( [ b1a ] ) , ( [ wdef ] ) and ( [ 2pf ] ) , as the connected 2-point green function in the presence of the infrared cut - off @xmath8 , involving the _ time - ordered _ product of two gauge fields at space - time points @xmath546 and @xmath777 : for ` connected ' ] @xmath778 } % { \\delta { \\cal j}_{a}^{\\mu}(x ) \\delta { \\cal j}_{b}^{\\nu}(y ) } \\right|_{{\\cal j}=0 } % \\;\\;=\\;\\ ; \\langle\\,0\\,|\\;\\mbox{t}\\;\\left[\\,{\\cal a}_\\mu^a(x ) { \\cal a}_\\nu^b(y)\\,\\right]\\,|\\,0\\,\\rangle_\\kappa \\label{e1 } \\;.\\ ] ] analogously we define now the gluon correlation function as the non - time ordered 2-point function which describes the correlation between two gluon fields at @xmath546 and @xmath777 , irrespective of their time history and spatial origin : @xmath779\\,|\\,0\\,\\rangle_\\kappa \\label{e2 } \\;.\\ ] ] in momentum space , we write ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) as , @xmath780 we recall that both the propagator and the correlator depend on @xmath36 and @xmath51 , more precisely on @xmath1 and @xmath781 .",
    "let us now focus on the correlation function @xmath586 and then work our way back to the propagator @xmath494 .",
    "following @xcite , we take the commutator in ( [ e2 ] ) apart and define ( suppressing the color indices , as they are in paralell with the lorentz indices ) , @xmath782 hence , @xmath783\\,|\\,0\\,\\rangle_\\kappa \\ ; , \\label{e7}\\ ] ] and we have the following properties , @xmath784 @xmath785    now , recall that in the axial gauges the @xmath36-dependence of both the propagator @xmath24 and the correlator @xmath79 can enter only in terms of the two invariants @xmath1 and @xmath204 .",
    "it is therefore useful to introduce a notation for the decomposition of an arbitrary four - vector @xmath786 into its longitudinal ( @xmath787 ) and transverse components ( @xmath788 ) with respect to the gauge vector @xmath109 : @xmath789 with @xmath790 , @xmath791 , and @xmath792 .",
