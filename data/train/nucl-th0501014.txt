    "the quest for discovering fundamental characteristics of atomic nuclei , such as their sizes and shapes , is as old as nuclear physics itself .",
    "although for the most part this challenge has been met with enormous success , precise knowledge of certain fundamental nuclear - structure properties  among them the spatial distribution of neutrons  is still lacking .",
    "while the original motivation for measuring the neutron density of atomic nuclei was deeply rooted in nuclear structure , the quest has been recently revived in response to the widespread impact that such a measurement will have over seemingly unrelated areas of physics . even though the present study concentrates exclusively on atomic parity non - conservation ( apnc ) @xcite , a brief review of areas that could benefit from an accurate measurement of the neutron density",
    "is also presented .",
    "unquestionably , the accurate determination of the neutron density  and in particular its root - mean - square ( rms ) radius  remains a top priority in nuclear - structure physics .",
    "this inadequate state of affairs is in stark contrast to our present knowledge of proton densities .",
    "indeed , the proton distribution in nuclei has already been mapped with exquisite precision , often much better than 1% @xcite , due to the availability of state - of - the - art electron - scattering facilities all over the world .",
    "a particularly illustrative example is @xmath0pb , a nucleus whose charge radius is presently known with an extremely high accuracy ( @xmath1  fm  @xcite ) that exceeds at least by two orders of magnitude that of its neutron radius .",
    "clearly , an accurate determination of neutron radii is a pressing issue .",
    "further , without such knowledge for stable nuclei , the prospects of real progress in the future domain of nuclear structure , namely , _ exotic nuclei _ , may be seriously compromised .",
    "precision studies of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force is an area that has been directly affected by our poor knowledge of neutron radii . at the most fundamental level ,",
    "quantum chromodynamics predicts a small flavor violation in the strong force due to the different charges and masses of the up and down quarks . in turn , this flavor violation induces a small ( of the order of 1% ) breaking in the isospin symmetry of the nn force .",
    "however , to accurately quantify these `` novel '' isospin violations , it is necessary to have all `` conventional '' effects under control .",
    "a good example of this interplay between novel and conventional is provided by the nolen - schiffer ( or coulomb energy ) anomaly .",
    "the anomaly consists in the residual discrepancy observed in the ground - state energies of mirror nuclei with a single nucleon added ( or removed ) from a closed shell ( e.g. , @xmath2sc@xmath2ca ) .",
    "however , some of the conventional effects depend sensitively on our knowledge of neutron radii .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that by using neutron skins  defined as the difference between the neutron and proton rms radii  significantly smaller than those predicted by theory ( and apparently justified by experiment ) the anomaly disappears  @xcite .",
    "knowledge of neutron radii could also remarkably improve our understanding of the equation of state of neutron - rich matter .",
    "although existing ground - state observables appear to constrain the symmetry energy of nuclear matter at a neutron density around @xmath3 @xmath4 ( as a reference value typical in nuclei ) @xcite , the density dependence of the symmetry energy is unknown .",
    "recently , however , it has been found that the neutron skin of a heavy nucleus , like @xmath5pb , calculated with different non - relativistic and relativistic mean field parametrizations displays a tight linear relationship with the slope of the equation of state of neutron matter ( or , analogously , with the derivative of the symmetry energy ) , evaluated at @xmath6 @xmath4 @xcite . in particular , models with a `` stiffer '' symmetry energy predict larger neutron skins .",
    "for instance , the neutron skin in @xmath5pb computed with relativistic models is larger by typically 0.10.2  fm than the value obtained with skyrme forces . in turn , the neutron skin of @xmath5pb is linearly correlated with the neutron skin of other relatively heavy nuclei such as @xmath7sn or @xmath8ba .",
    "thus , a measurement of the neutron radius of @xmath0pb , or indeed of any other heavy nucleus , could fix a fundamental property of the equation of state .",
    "fixing the slope of the symmetry energy at @xmath9 will also impact favorably on astrophysical observables , particularly on the structure and dynamics of neutron stars .",
    "indeed , strong correlations between the neutron skin of @xmath5pb and various neutron - star properties have been established  @xcite . among these , a model - independent relation between the neutron skin of @xmath5pb and the transition density from uniform neutron - rich matter ( in the mantle ) to a non - uniform phase ( in the crust ) was observed .",
    "other neutron - star properties sensitive to the neutron skin of @xmath5pb include the radius of the star , its composition , and its cooling mechanism @xcite .",
    "ultimately , these correlations emerge as a result of the similar composition of the neutron skin of a heavy nucleus and the crust of a neutron star , namely , neutron - rich matter at similar densities .    while the above arguments are already compelling enough to justify the commission of new experiments to measure the neutron radius of @xmath5pb with unprecedented accuracy  @xcite , this manuscript will focus on the crucial role that such a measurement could have on precision studies of the standard model , vis -  - vis , atomic parity non - conservation .",
    "the road to new physics beyond the standard model in low - energy tests in atoms , which stems from violations of fundamental symmetries that occur in the weak interaction , passes through the observation of deviations between the values measured in the laboratory and the predictions of the standard model .",
    "the effects are inherently small and , traditionally , the analysis of apnc experiments has been hindered by uncertainties in both atomic and nuclear - structure theory .",
    "however , a fruitful strategy has been devised to remove the sensitivity to atomic theory .",
    "this strategy consists in measuring _",
    "ratios _ of parity - violating observables along an isotopic chain  @xcite . in this manner , uncertainties in the atomic theory factor out from the ratios . based on their long chains of several naturally occurring isotopes , cesium ,",
    "barium , dysprosium , and ytterbium appear as ideal candidates  @xcite . as a result , nuclear - structure uncertainties  primarily in the form of neutron radii  remain as the limiting factor in the search for physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .    in an earlier study , a strong correlation between the neutron radius of @xmath5pb and the neutron radii of @xmath8ba , @xmath10dy , and @xmath11yb was established  @xcite . in that study the density dependence of the symmetry energy  and consequently the neutron radius of @xmath5pb",
    " was modified through the addition of a new coupling constant ( @xmath12 ) to the underlying lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "this new coupling allows one to modify the density dependence of the symmetry energy without changing the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter . in a heavy nucleus",
    "@xmath12 modifies the rms radius of the neutron density while leaving the rms radius of the proton density and the total binding energy practically unchanged @xcite .",
    "however , the nuclear - structure model used lacked both deformation and pairing effects that are important for the nuclei considered in apnc experiments .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite the calculations were limited to the study of a single member of each isotopic chain ( the one with a closed neutron shell ) .",
    "this shortcoming is resolved in the present contribution . as a result",
    ", one is now able to map the neutron radii of these long isotopic chains as a function of both the neutron number @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "there are previous studies of the isotopic dependence of the neutron radius in the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approximation  @xcite and of its dependence on @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "yet the merit of the present work is that uncertainties in the neutron radius are studied for the first time as a function of both @xmath13 and @xmath12 within a unified `` best - fit '' model .",
    "in addition , it has been recently pointed out that the accuracy in the measurements of apnc effects can be improved by using high-@xmath15 atoms , such as francium , where the parity violating effects are expected to be an order of magnitude larger than in cesium @xcite .",
    "thus we also include , in anticipation of future experiments , the analysis of the nuclear structure corrections to the weak charge in francium isotopes .",
    "the manuscript has been organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] a short description of the nuclear model is given , with special emphasis paid to the treatment of deformation and pairing correlations as well as to the predictions of the model applied to cesium , barium , dysprosium , and ytterbium . in sec .",
    "[ results ] a brief review of atomic parity violation is given , with the main goal of addressing uncertainties in apnc observables emerging from our poor knowledge of neutron radii ; a detailed analysis of such uncertainties within our model is also presented in the same section .",
    "finally the conclusions are reserved for sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we may summarize the two main conclusions of our work as follows .",
    "first , it appears that even when using the wealth of existing ground - state observables to constrain our nuclear - structure models , the uncertainties in the neutron radius of heavy nuclei  and consequently on apnc observables  may have been underestimated .",
    "second , we have found , as others have before us , a tight correlation between the neutron radius of @xmath5pb and the neutron radii of barium , dysprosium , and ytterbium , which is shown here to hold also in deformed systems and in the presence of pairing .",
    "this correlation suggests that the nuclear structure observables relevant for apnc will profit positively from the upcoming high precision measurement of the neutron radius of @xmath5pb at the jefferson laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the mean field treatment of effective field theories of hadrons , generally known as quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) , is well established as a successful approach for describing diverse bulk and single - particle properties of finite nuclei and uniform nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "these effective field theories are based on a lagrangian density that contains the nucleon ( as an elementary dirac particle ) together with an isoscalar - scalar ( @xmath16 ) meson , an isoscalar - vector ( @xmath17 ) meson , an isovector - vector ( @xmath18 ) meson , and the photon as the relevant degrees of freedom for describing the nuclear many - body problem . in the mean field approximation the meson fields",
    "are replaced by their ground - state expectation values , thereby becoming classical fields .",
    "the quantum structure of the theory is carried by the nucleon field . for systems with time reversal symmetry ,",
    "only the time - like component of the vector fields contribute . at the mean field",
    "( `` tadpole '' ) level , charge conservation implies that only the third component ( in isospin space ) of the isovector @xmath18-meson field does not vanish . as a final product ,",
    "one obtains the following hamiltonian density : @xmath19 \\varphi_\\alpha \\nonumber \\\\[3 mm ] & & + \\frac{1}{2g_{\\rm s}^2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}\\phi\\right ) ^2 + m_{\\rm s}^2\\phi^2\\right ] + \\frac{\\kappa}{3!}{\\phi^3}+\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}{\\phi^4 } -\\frac{1}{2g_{\\rm v}^2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$ } w\\right ) ^2 + m_{\\rm v}^2 w^2\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\[3 mm ] & & -\\frac{1}{2g_\\rho^2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$ } b\\right ) ^2 + m_\\rho^2 b ^2\\right ] -\\lambda_{\\rm v } w^2b^2",

    "the scaled meson fields associated with the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 mesons are , respectively , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "finally , @xmath25 represents the time - like component of the photon field .",
    "the variation of eq .",
    "( [ pv1 ] ) with respect to the dirac spinors yields the dirac equation satisfied by the nucleons , while the variations with respect to the meson fields lead to the klein - gordon equations for the corresponding mesons @xcite .",
    "the functional in eq .",
    "( [ pv1 ] ) contains cubic and quartic scalar meson self - interactions ( couplings @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) that are tuned to bring the value of the compression modulus of symmetric nuclear matter down to the empirical value ( @xmath28300  mev )  @xcite .",
    "further , through the inclusion of these terms one can accurately reproduce the systematics of finite nuclei throughout the periodic table as , e.g. , in the case of the celebrated relativistic mean field ( rmf ) parameter set nl3  @xcite .",
    "the additional isoscalar - isovector cross coupling @xmath12 enables one to modify the density dependence of the symmetry energy without compromising the success of the model .    insofar as we are interested in the properties of some relatively heavy nuclei that have been identified as possible candidates for apnc experiments , we extend the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to include nuclear deformation and pairing correlations in the present rmf study . only quadrupole deformation ( @xmath29 ) is included though , as it is known that hexadecapole deformation is generally small for the nuclei under consideration  @xcite .",
    "a bcs framework is employed to deal with the pairing correlations .",
    "note that because the nuclei to be studied lie relatively close to the @xmath30-stability line , the use of the bcs approximation is justified as the fermi level is sufficiently bound and the mixing with continuum states  essential for drip line nuclei  is not relevant here . as in most bcs calculations ,",
    "the strength of the neutron - neutron and proton - proton pairing interactions is determined from the neutron and proton pairing gaps ( respectively , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) evaluated from the experimental odd - even mass differences , using a five - point formula  @xcite .    the dirac equation and the klein - gordon equations for the meson fields",
    "are treated using an axially deformed basis expansion method as described in detail in refs .",
    "the calculations presented here have been carried out by expanding the fermionic wave functions and the bosonic fields in 12 and 20 oscillator shells , respectively .",
    "the solution of the equations in an axially deformed basis for the odd - even and odd - odd nuclei is more complicated .",
    "indeed , in these cases time reversal symmetry is broken and the odd particle induces polarization currents and time - odd components in the mean fields .",
    "however , the impact of these effects on deformation and binding energies is small  @xcite and will be neglected henceforth . in the pairing calculation of the odd nucleon",
    "we use the blocking approximation  @xcite , thereby restoring time reversal invariance in the intrinsic frame .    for the isotopic chains under consideration for apnc experiments , namely , cs , ba , dy , and yb",
    ", the nl3 parameter set yields ground - state properties , such as binding energies and deformations , in good agreement with the available experimental data  @xcite . for our calculations we adopt the nl3 parameter set and suitably modify it with the addition of the isoscalar - isovector coupling @xmath14 , prompted by the fact that the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy at ( or near ) the saturation density is at present unknown .",
    "thus , we utilize the nonlinear isoscalar - isovector term @xmath14 to change the density dependence of the symmetry energy , which in turn modifies the neutron radius of neutron - rich nuclei . this can be done without a significant change in those ground - state properties of finite nuclei that are well constrained experimentally  @xcite . in practice , for a given @xmath12 value we readjust the nucleon - rho coupling constant @xmath33 so that the symmetry energy of nuclear matter at a density of @xmath34 be 25.68 mev  @xcite .",
    "the choice is motivated by the fact that the symmetry energy of uniform nuclear matter at saturation density is not well constrained by the known properties of finite nuclei .",
    "rather , it is some average between the bulk symmetry energy at saturation and the surface symmetry energy which is constrained by the binding energy of finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "for example , typical effective nuclear forces fitted to the empirical energies of nuclei predict a liquid drop model symmetry energy coefficient , which contains a surface correction , of 2224  mev for @xmath5pb  @xcite , far smaller than the value of the bulk symmetry energy coefficient for that interaction .    although it has been established that a variety of ground - state properties of spherical nuclei are insensitive to the choice of @xmath12  @xcite , this is not the case for the neutron skin .",
    "the neutron skin @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the neutron and proton rms radii ( @xmath38 ) , is strongly sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy and hence , to the isoscalar - isovector coupling @xmath12 .",
    "this is because the slope ( i.e. , pressure ) of the symmetry energy controls how far is the neutron skin pushed out relative to the symmetric core . in order to show that this scenario holds true even when the spherical symmetry is broken and pairing correlations are important , we display in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the charge radius , binding energy , quadrupole deformation , and the neutron skin as a function of @xmath12 for the representative heavy nucleus @xmath39yb .",
    "note that all observables in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] have been normalized to the corresponding nl3 values ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "it is seen that the charge radius , binding energy and quadrupole deformation are insensitive to the value of @xmath12 in the 00.025 range ; the quadrupole deformation displays the largest change , but this amounts to only 2% . in contrast , the neutron skin decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath12 and it varies by about 25% when @xmath12 is changed from 0 to 0.025 .",
    "this reflects the softening of the symmetry energy as @xmath12 increases .",
    "therefore , we conclude that neither pairing correlations nor deformation alter our earlier conclusions about the role of @xmath12 in the systematics of finite nuclei .",
    "the neutron skin of a nucleus is an important component in the study of atomic parity non - conservation .",
    "so is its charge radius . while neutron radii of heavy nuclei ( @xmath36 )",
    "are poorly known , high precision data for the charge radii are available .",
    "to test the reliability of our model , we now compare in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] calculated charge radii with experimental data for some of the relevant isotopes used in apnc experiments ; these include cs , ba , dy and yb . the experimental values are taken from the recent compilation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which combines measured data from electron scattering , from muonic x - rays , and from @xmath41 and optical isotope shifts for the purpose of providing a unified set of nuclear charge radii .",
    "theoretical calculations are presented with the original nl3 parametrization ( @xmath40 ) and with one for which the density dependence of the symmetry energy has been softened by fixing the value of the isoscalar - isovector coupling to @xmath42 .",
    "it can be seen that both sets of calculated charge radii are in excellent agreement with the experimental values for _ all _ of the considered nuclei . at a more quantitative level , we find that the relative @xmath43 value between the theoretical and experimental charge radii for the isotopic chains of cs , ba , dy , and yb is always smaller than 0.25% for both ( @xmath40 and @xmath44 ) parameter sets .",
    "this result validates the use of both parameter sets in computing key nuclear observables of relevance to the apnc program .",
    "note that the binding energies and deformations for all the nuclei considered here are also in good agreement with the experimental data ( not shown ) .",
    "moreover , and as alluded earlier , these observables are highly insensitive to the choice of @xmath12 .",
    "a more daring challenge for a theoretical model than the charge radii themselves is the reproduction of the observed charge isotope shifts .",
    "one famous case is the pronounced kink exhibited by the experimental charge radii of the pb nuclei at the magic neutron number @xmath45 .",
    "the kink is not reproduced by conventional non - relativistic theories ( either skyrme or gogny forces ) .",
    "in contrast , the rmf calculations show a remarkable agreement with experiment @xcite . the origin for the deviations between the two models has been traced back , largely , to the isospin dependence of the spin - orbit term .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig2new ] results for the isotope shifts in two of our flagship chains for the subsequent apnc analysis : the cesium and francium alkali metals .",
    "the shifts are referred to @xmath46cs and @xmath47fr , respectively , as are the data of ref .",
    "the experimental method of preference for the measurement of nuclear charge isotope shifts is high - resolution laser spectroscopy , which exploits the isotopic effects on the hyperfine structure of atomic optical transitions .",
    "in addition to the rmf calculations with @xmath48 and @xmath49 we have drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig2new ] the skm * and siii results of the non - relativistic hartree - fock calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite for cs .",
    "one immediately recognizes the ability of the rmf model in reproducing the trend of the changes of the experimental data when neutrons are added ; conspicuously , the change of slope at the @xmath50 shell closure for cs and at the @xmath45 shell closure for fr . in spite of this , the theoretical predictions may be off the experiment by a factor of @xmath51 in some specific isotopes .",
    "one should keep in mind that this happens in cases where the isotope shift is a small quantity and that it emerges from the cancellation of two much larger numbers ( the square charge radii of two isotopes ) . similarly to the observables discussed above , the calculated isotope shift is a quantity that remains unaffected by the @xmath12 coupling .",
    "as has been mentioned in earlier publications  @xcite , typical relativistic parametrizations predict a neutron skin in @xmath5pb of about @xmath52  fm .",
    "this should be contrasted with the case of non - relativistic forces of the skyrme or gogny type that yield values that are significantly smaller ( between 0.1 and 0.2  fm ) .",
    "as the proton rms radius in @xmath5pb is reproduced by both relativistic and non - relativistic models , the spread in the neutron rms radius in @xmath5pb  owing to the different density dependence of the symmetry energy in different theoretical models  is about 0.10.2  fm . within the relativistic mean - field models a spread ( i.e.",
    ", a theoretical uncertainty ) of the neutron skin for a specific nucleus can be simulated in a controlled manner through the addition of the isoscalar - isovector coupling @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "starting from the original nl3 parameter set and changing the isoscalar - isovector coupling constant from @xmath40 ( pure nl3 interaction ) to @xmath44 , the neutron skin in @xmath5pb varies from 0.280  fm to 0.209  fm @xcite .",
    "hence , in this formalism the induced theoretical uncertainty of the neutron radius of @xmath5pb between these two extreme values of @xmath14 is approximately @xmath53  fm .",
    "this spread for @xmath5pb is only slightly larger than the expected experimental error in the measurement of the neutron radius in @xmath5pb via the parity violating electron - scattering experiment at the jefferson laboratory ( known as the prex experiment )  @xcite .",
    "thus we take the theoretical spread in the neutron radius of @xmath5pb as a baseline to estimate a realistic uncertainty in those nuclei involved in apnc experiments .",
    "the neutron skins calculated with both of the relativistic parametrizations ( namely , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) for stable and long - lived isotopes of cs , ba , dy , and yb are displayed in fig .  [ fig3 ] . for a specific isotope , the shift between the two curves displayed in the figure gives the model spread ( due to @xmath12 ) of the neutron skin of the given nucleus .",
    "for all the considered isotopic chains the neutron skins calculated with @xmath40 ( the stiffest symmetry energy ) and @xmath44 ( the softest symmetry energy ) lie roughly along two parallel lines . in general",
    ", the effect of @xmath12 on the neutron skin is more prominent for the more asymmetric and heavier nuclei .",
    "this can be observed for the relatively long chain of cs isotopes in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the spread of the neutron skin varies approximately from 0.03 fm to 0.06 fm in passing from @xmath54cs to @xmath55cs .    to the extent that in the rmf model used in this work the proton rms radius of a given nucleus is almost independent of @xmath12 , the theoretical spread of its neutron skin is therefore approximately equal to the one for its neutron rms radius .",
    "at present , the situation regarding our ignorance of the neutron skin of heavy nuclei is unlikely to improve because the existing experimental data can not reduce the spread in the neutron radii of cs , ba , dy , or yb any further .",
    "thus , we now examine whether the prex experiment on the neutron radius of @xmath5pb may place important constraints on the neutron skin of apnc nuclei , including those deformed isotopes with an odd number of nucleons .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] evidences the strong linear correlation  @xcite between the neutron skin of @xmath46cs , @xmath8ba , @xmath56dy , and @xmath57yb and that of @xmath5pb .",
    "the calculations include values for the isoscalar - isovector coupling constant @xmath12 ranging from 0 to 0.025 .",
    "note that the correlation holds even for the case of deformed nuclei having an odd number of nucleons . with the culmination of the prex experiment ,",
    "the present theoretical spread in the neutron radius of @xmath5pb of @xmath58  fm ( relativistic and non - relativistic models altogether ) @xcite will be replaced by a genuine experimental error five times smaller ; that is , @xmath59  fm  @xcite . this experimental error in the neutron radius of @xmath5pb",
    "will also be the experimental error in the neutron skin , as the proton radius is known with a much higher accuracy .",
    "if the expected experimental accuracy is attained , then the spread in the neutron skin of the several apnc isotopes will also be ( indirectly ) reduced . in turn , this result will impact favorably on apnc observables by appreciably reducing the nuclear structure uncertainty .",
    "parity violation in atomic systems arises from the interference between the parity conserving electromagnetic interaction and the parity violating weak interaction .",
    "although most of the binding energy of the atomic electrons comes from their attractive coulomb interaction with the @xmath15 protons in the nucleus , the weak charge of the nucleus @xmath60 induces a small correction in the binding energy and parity of the electronic wave functions .",
    "these small corrections can be measured experimentally .",
    "the experimentally measured quantity is the electric dipole amplitude between two electronic states that in the absence of parity violating effects would have the same parity , thereby making the amplitude vanish .",
    "the observable related to the dipole amplitude can be parametrized as follows  @xcite : @xmath61\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 embodies the atomic structure contribution and @xmath63 represents the weak charge of a nucleus of neutron number @xmath13 and electric charge @xmath15 .",
    "the experimentally measured weak charge of the nucleus ( without radiative corrections  @xcite ) @xmath63 differs from the standard model prediction , @xmath64 by a nuclear correction factor that arises from the difference between proton and neutron one - body densities .",
    "that is , @xmath65 with @xmath66 note that in eq .",
    "( [ pv4 ] ) @xmath67 is the weinberg ( or weak mixing ) angle , while @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ pv6 ] ) is the neutron ( proton ) density normalized to one , and @xmath69 is an electronic form factor that describes the spatial variation of the electronic axial - vector matrix element over the size of the nucleus .    the atomic parity formalism `` starts '' by assuming that neutrons and protons have the same spatial distribution and then adds a nuclear - structure correction factor to quantify the differences between the actual neutron and proton densities .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the proton density , which is needed to determine various parity conserving observables , is very accurately known . during the course of this presentation  and as has been done elsewhere  @xcite  an additional quantity that parametrizes the nuclear structure corrections will be extensively used .",
    "this quantity is defined as follows : @xmath70 note that , in terms of this quantity , the weak charge of the nucleus may be written as @xmath71                    \\nonumber \\\\                 & = & \\big[-nq_n+zq_{p}(1 - 4\\sin^{2}\\theta_{w})\\big ]                     \\frac{1}{q_{p } }                    \\nonumber \\\\                 & = & \\big[q_w^{\\rm sm}(n , z)+q_w^{\\rm nucl}(n , z)\\big ]                    \\frac{1}{q_{p } }                    \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to compute the axial form factor @xmath69 one expands the electronic dirac wave functions in a power series about the origin  @xcite ( the coulomb potential is assumed to be that of a uniform nuclear charge distribution ) . using this",
    "prescription yields the electronic form factor in closed form : @xmath72,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the cutoff radius of a sharp nuclear charge density .",
    "effects from the finite nuclear size are computed from the ground - state expectation value of the time - like component of the weak vector current by considering the neutron and proton as point - like particles .",
    "again , we assume sharp proton and neutron densities with rms radii equal to those predicted by self - consistent rmf models .",
    "note that the relation between the sharp cutoff radii @xmath74 and the corresponding rms radii @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 estimates for the weak matrix elements @xmath77 and @xmath78 are then given by the following expressions : @xmath79 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1-(z\\alpha)^2\\left[\\frac{817}{3150}+\\frac{232}{525 } \\frac{t}{r_p}+{\\cal o}\\big((t / r_p)^{2}\\big)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although in the present approximation @xmath77 does not depend on nuclear structure effects , the sensitivity of @xmath78 to nuclear structure uncertainties appears in the form of the rms proton radius  which is well known  and the poorly known neutron skin @xmath80 .",
    "the measurement of the weak charge in apnc experiments is plagued by theoretical uncertainties in both atomic and nuclear structure .",
    "fortunately , uncertainties in atomic structure may be eliminated , or at least considerably reduced , by studying parity violation along a chain of isotopes and taking ratios of apnc measurements  @xcite . according to eq .",

    "the measurement of the electron - nucleon parity violating effect in @xmath46cs to 0.35% accuracy @xcite remains to date as the paradigm of apnc experimental precision .",
    "because atomic uncertainties have been eliminated from the ratio ( [ pv8 ] ) , the remaining uncertainties in @xmath86 reflect the known accuracy in the neutron and proton rms radii .",
    "while proton densities have been determined from electron - scattering experiments with remarkable accuracy , knowledge of the neutron densities to a comparable level of accuracy is lacking .",

    "note that the quoted error in the neutron radius of @xmath5pb is also the error in its neutron skin as the proton radius is known with a much higher accuracy .",
    "inasmuch as a linear correlation between the neutron skin of @xmath5pb and that of the apnc nuclei has been established ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty in the weak charge can be obtained from the spread in the neutron skin of the apnc nuclei using the @xmath40 and the @xmath44 parameter sets .",
    "let us outline the procedure we shall follow to determine the relative error in @xmath86 ( namely , @xmath94 ) .",
    "first , we calculate the neutron skin @xmath95 in a certain isotopic chain using the @xmath40 parametrization .",
    "since @xmath37 is roughly similar for all the isotopes of the chain , the fractional neutron skin variation along the chain is estimated as @xmath96 where @xmath97 refers to the heaviest member and @xmath98 to the lightest member of the isotopic chain under consideration , and @xmath99 is the average proton rms radius of the nuclei in the chain .",
    "next , we compute the corresponding fractional neutron skin variation @xmath100 for the softer @xmath44 parameter set . finally , the model spread @xcite is obtained as the difference between the fractional neutron skin variations calculated in the two parameter sets .",
    "that is , @xmath101 in table  [ table1 ] we display the relative uncertainty @xmath102 in the ratio @xmath86 for each one of the isotope chains ( cs , ba , dy , and yb ) together with the different components required to compute it .",
    "these are the largest neutron number of the isotopic chain @xmath103 , the largest difference in the neutron number of the isotopic chain @xmath104 , the average proton rms radius @xmath99 , and the model spread @xmath105 .",
    "the latter turns out to be a small quantity , not only in the present relativistic calculations but also in calculations with non - relativistic nuclear energy functionals ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "the reason resides in the approximately linear relationship of the neutron skin along a chain of isotopes with the neutron number . while the model dependence in the value of the intercept is obvious ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the slope is only mildly model dependent . and",
    "it is the difference in slope that the model spread @xmath105 is sensitive to .",
    "it is seen that the estimated relative uncertainty of the apnc ratios @xmath86 in the four isotopic chains considered is around 0.25%0.35% , with a slight increase with increasing atomic number .",
    "the quoted uncertainty appears somewhat larger than the @xmath91 value that would be desirable to extract new physics limits beyond the present reach of the @xmath46cs experiment . note that the neutron skin along a given isotopic chain varies ( almost ) linearly with neutron number ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this makes the model spread @xmath105 roughly proportional to the neutron difference @xmath104 .",
    "as the combination @xmath106 is therefore nearly independent of @xmath104  @xcite , it is unlikely that the precision in @xmath86 can be improved by enlarging the range of the neutron difference @xmath104 between the two extremes of the isotopic chain [ see eq .",

    "table  [ table1 ] also displays the model spread @xmath107_{0.1\\%}$ ] that would be required to reach the sought - after relative uncertainty of 0.1% in the isotopic ratio @xmath86 . in all cases this number is smaller than the value provided by the rmf model . recall that we have tuned the effective interaction by means of @xmath12 to mimic the purported 1% accuracy of the prex experiment .",
    "hence , it appears that under the present  and future  situation , nuclear structure uncertainties affecting the variation of the neutron distribution along an isotopic chain are too large to make @xmath86 a useful probe for physics beyond the standard model",
    ". however , note that the differences are not dramatic : a factor 2.5 for cs and ba , 2.75 for dy , and 3 for yb .",
    "thus , second generation experiments and/or novel facilities may significantly aid in this quest .      for most of the apnc nuclei ",

    "while such a measurement will have far reaching consequences in fields as diverse as nuclear structure , flavor violations in the strong interactions , and nuclear astrophysics , we have focused in this contribution exclusively on apnc observables .    our theoretical framework is based on the highly successful relativistic nl3 parameter set , suitably modified by the addition of an isoscalar - isovector term ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "the second set of observables involves a direct determination of the weak charge of various alkali metals , such as cesium and francium .",
    "unfortunately , these elements have very few stable or long - lived isotopes , so in their case the accurate determination of ratios of weak nuclear charges is more difficult .    in the case of the isotopic ratio @xmath86 , it has been claimed that a significant test of the standard model requires a determination of @xmath86 to better than 0.1% .",
