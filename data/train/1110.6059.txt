    "the light - cone ( lc ) operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) permanently receives much attention , since it enables us to separate contributions to cross sections coming from large and small distances in a variety of processes .",
    "it was proposed as a generalization of the ope at short distances  @xcite in order to describe deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons off nucleons .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the t - product of two scalar currents near the lc was defined in term of so - called bi - local light - ray composite fields . later on it",

    "the internal sums in @xmath9 are omitted in since neglected terms do not contribute to dis structure functions ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . below we will discuss this point in more details .",
    "the standard approach to calculations of the ope cfs is to apply for perturbation theory by considering the scattering of leptons off _ elementary _ ( quark and gluon ) _ off - shell _ fields . in ref .",
