    "it is now widely believed that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by accretion on to a supermassive black hole .",
    "however , it is still not yet known why some of these active galaxies exhibit powerful radio emission .",
    "the mass of the central black hole appears to play at least a minor rle in generating powerful ( @xmath4  w  hz@xmath5  sr@xmath5 ) radio emission [ e.g. @xcite ] , but this is certainly not the only parameter , with accretion rate and possibly black - hole spin playing crucially important rles [ e.g. see the review by @xcite ] .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the host galaxies of flat - spectrum , high - frequency selected quasars , inhabit less massive host galaxies than their low - frequency selected ( and therefore selected independent of orientation ) radio - loud quasar counterparts and also their optically selected counterparts , @xcite . this in turn leads to the implication that the black holes in the flat - spectrum quasars ( fsqs ) fall below the upper envelope in the radio power ",
    "black - hole mass plane proposed by @xcite , if the bulge luminosity  black - hole mass relation holds out to cosmologically significant redshifts .",
    "this suggests that radio power may not be correlated with the mass of the supermassive black hole , and must be due to some other physical process .",
    "this idea was re - investigated by @xcite who suggested that the orientation of the fsqs , with the radio jets preferentially orientated along the line - of - sight to the observer , may also be a factor .",
    "they conclude that by taking into account the effects of doppler boosting and also by assuming the broad - line region may have a disk - like geometry @xcite that the black - holes in fsqs may be consistent with the upper envelope in black - hole mass ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ mjjfig1 ] ) .    to investigate this question",
    "further we have embarked upon a study of both the host galaxies and emission - line properties of fsqs selected from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present some initial results on the host galaxies of four of these quasars at a redshift of @xmath6 .",
    "we have obtained deep @xmath0-band observations of seven @xmath6 fsqs from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample @xcite with vlt - isaac .",
    "the observations were taken in photometric conditions with typical seeing of 0.5  arcsec .",
    "each object was observed for a total time of 1.5  hours .",
    "a detailed account of the observations of the complete sample of 7 @xmath6 flat - spectrum quasars will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( jarvis & mclure in prep . ) .",
    "the depth of the observations have allowed us to accurately determine the point - spread function for each source , allowing accurate modelling and subtraction of the quasar nucleus .",
    "this has subsequently enabled us to determine detailed characteristics of the underlying host galaxies in these objects .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained 1.5  hours of @xmath7-band spectroscopy on each object , again with isaac , to determine the width of the broad h@xmath3 line in each these objects which should enable us to estimate the mass of the central supermassive black hole via the virial black - hole mass estimate @xcite",
    "we have performed detailed modelling of the host galaxies of all of the fsqs in our sample using the modelling technique described in mclure , dunlop & kukula ( 2000 ) .",
    "full morphological parameters of the fsqs will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    ".[tab1]flat - spectrum quasars considered in this paper .",
    "typical error on the host magnitudes is @xmath8  mag . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this paper we focus on the @xmath9-band magnitudes determined for the host galaxies and compare these with the radio galaxy host magnitudes which are uncontaminated by the bright point source resulting from the quasar nucleus .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the sources with there relevant properties , fig .",
    "[ kz ] shows that all of these sources are consistent with lying on the radio galaxy @xmath2 hubble diagram @xcite implying that the hosts of these powerful radio selected quasars are some of the most massive galaxies in the universe , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "this is in apparent opposition to the conclusions reached by @xcite . from their analysis of lower redshift flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars they suggested that the radio - loud quasars possibly reside in less luminous galaxies in comparison to their optically selected quasar counterparts .",
    "although this may well be true to some degree with respect to the optical selection biases , we find that genuinely powerful radio - loud agn ( i.e. @xmath11  w  hz@xmath5  sr@xmath5 ) do seem to inhabit super-@xmath12 galaxies over all cosmic epochs .",
    "in this section we utilize the correlation between black - mass and bulge luminosity ( @xmath13 ) to estimate the black - hole masses in these fsqs .    using the relation between black - hole mass and bulge luminosity given in mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) ,",
    "i.e. @xmath14    we can estimate the mass of the central supermassive black holes in these quasars .",
    "assuming that the host galaxies evolve along the tracks shown in fig .",
    "[ kz ] then the host galaxies of the fsqs are all larger than 3  @xmath15 ( using @xmath16 from kochanek et al .",
    "2001 ) . using @xmath17 for local ellipticals",
    "we find that according to the @xmath13 relation that all of our fsqs contain black - holes with @xmath18 .",
    "this is in line with the upper envelope in the black - hole mass  radio power plane proposed by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , where genuinely powerful radio - loud sources are powered by black holes with mass @xmath19 .",
    "this implies that targeting _ powerful _",
    "radio - loud quasars or radio galaxies allows one to probe the upper bounds in black - hole mass at any given epoch .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the possible orientation bias in using the virial black - hole mass estimator .",
    "it has been shown that the width of the broad emission lines in radio - loud quasars are dependent on the orientation of the source ( e.g. wills & browne 1986 ; brotherton 1996 ; vestergaard , wilkes & barthel 2000 ) , with the more pole - on sources , i.e. those with high radio core - to - lobe flux ratios , having narrower broad lines .",
    "therefore , according to most forms of the orientation based unified schemes for active galaxies , the flat - spectrum quasars , which are presumed to be pole - on powerful radio - loud quasars , should exhibit the narrowest broad lines .",
    "the fsqs from the sample of oshlack et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have a mean fwhm of the h@xmath3 broad emission line of @xmath20  km  s@xmath5 . on the contrary , the low - frequency selected quasars from the molonglo quasar sample ( baker et al .",
    "1999 ) , where the low - frequency gives an orientation independent selection technique , has a mean fwhm(h@xmath3 ) @xmath21  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this at least implies that orientation may need to be considered when using the virial black - hole mass estimator , at least for radio - loud quasars . in a subsequent paper",
    "we investigate this further for our sample of @xmath6 fsqs with deep @xmath22band spectroscopy around the h@xmath3 emission line .",
