    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are extraordinary factories of recycled pulsars ; over the last 30 years , 146 pulsars have been discovered in galactic gcs , with several thousands more still to be discovered @xcite .",
    "this pulsar population is completely different from the galactic population , with a very high fraction of pulsars with rotational periods of a few milliseconds ( msps ) . until a few years ago gcs had the majority of all known radio msps .",
    "this happens because gcs are very old stellar systems , so most `` normal '' pulsars in them have long faded into inactive neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "even accounting for the number of inactive nss , gcs have a very large number of msps per unit mass compared to the galaxy .",
    "the reason for this is the high stellar density in the cores of gcs , which permits exchange encounters , and the formation of new binaries consisting of old , inactive nss with low - mass main sequence stars .",
    "the evolution of the latter then causes the system to evolve into a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) , of which there are many in gcs , and which will likely evolve into an msp with some sort of companion star , usually a white dwarf ( wd ) or occassionally a low - mass non - degenerate star . in clusters with very dense cores however , this general evolution could be disturbed by further encounters , generating systems that one would not expect to result from the evolution of lmxbs , such as partially recycled pulsars and secondary exchange encounter products .",
    "the study of this abundant pulsar population has already resulted in a large number of scientific results , such as ns mass measurements , tests of general relativity @xcite , the detection of intracluster gas @xcite , and also constraints on the properties of the parent clusters @xcite .",
    "this last application is especially relevant for this paper .    among all galactic gcs",
    ", terzan 5 has the largest number of known pulsars , 36 , which represent almost a quarter of the total population of pulsars in gcs .",
    "the first discovery , j1748@xmath122446a , is a very bright pulsar in an eclipsing system @xcite , which we would now label as a `` redback '' .",
    "ten years later , a second pulsar was announced , j1748@xmath122446c @xcite . in 2004 ,",
    "the commissioning of the s - band receiver at the gbt and the 800-mhz - wide pulsar spigot back - end @xcite provided a large increase in sensitivity , which together with better search procedures @xcite resulted in the discovery of 21 new pulsars @xcite .",
    "since then another 14 pulsars have been discovered , three of which will soon be reported upon by cadelano et al .",
    "( 2017 ) ( j1748@xmath122446aj & j1748@xmath122446ak & j1748 - 2446al ) though only j1748@xmath122446aj & j1748@xmath122446ak have timing solutions at this time .",
    "this population is quite extraordinary , it includes seven highly eccentric msp systems , and 5 `` black widow '' and `` redback '' systems , one of which , j1748@xmath122446ad , is the fastest - spinning pulsar known @xcite .",
    "more details about these `` black widows '' and `` redbacks '' are discussed in section [ subsubsec : bw_rb ] .",
    "this uniquely large population of pulsars orbiting in the shared gravitational potential of terzan 5 can provide a wealth of information about the cluster that is difficult to obtain with optical and infrared observations .",
    "coincidentally , terzan 5 is one of the most intriguing and least understood gcs in the galaxy .",
    "historically , terzan 5 has been a very difficult globular cluster to study using ground - based telescopes . located within the bulge of the milky way",
    ", it suffers from an average color excess of e(b - v ) of 2.38 and strong differential reddening @xcite . as a result",
    ", it has only been through the use of space - based telescopes and adaptive optics in the near infrared that this cluster has become better understood in the past few years .",
    "currently , the most accurate measurement of the cluster distance places terzan 5 at d=5.9@xmath130.5 kpc @xcite , the exact value of which can influence the inferred physical characteristics of the system .",
    "@xcite uncovered two distinct stellar populations in terzan 5 , one metal rich with [ fe / h]@xmath140.3 and a fainter , metal poor population with [ fe / h]@xmath14 - 0.2 .",
    "additional observations @xcite of this cluster have revealed a third , even more metal poor component with [ fe / h]@xmath14 - 0.79 .",
    "all of these findings point to the fact that this system has had a unique history and may not be a true globular cluster ; instead it may have originally been a dwarf galaxy and undergone tidal stripping due to repeated interactions with the milky way s potential @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite give improved measurements of the physical characteristics of the cluster .",
    "@xcite found the center of gravity ( cog ) for terzan 5 using the absolute positions of stars taken with the european southern observatory s multi - conjugate adaptive optics demonstrator ( eso - mad ) to be at @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite used the observed number density of luminous red giants about the cog to find a central mass density of ( 1 - 4)@xmath1710@xmath2 m@xmath3 pc@xmath4 , a core radius for the red giants of @xmath18 , and a total mass of 2@xmath1710@xmath2 m@xmath3 , though error estimates are not provided by their work . using high resolution hubble space telescope data , further studies by @xcite found a core radius of the luminous red giants of @xmath19 .    in terms of msp formation ,",
    "terzan 5 is interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "studies of the radio luminosity function place the number of potentially observable pulsars in the cluster at @xmath20150 , which is the largest predicted pulsar population for all known globular clusters @xcite . with 50 x - ray sources identified in the cluster @xcite and one of the largest stellar collision rates for globular clusters @xcite ,",
    "terzan 5 has a set of physical characteristics that are particularly favorable for the formation of lmxbs and msps .",
    "a common concern in previous optical and infrared studies of the structural parameters of terzan 5 has been finding a way to circumvent the difficulties introduced by the severe reddening and stellar crowding .",
    "pulsar timing allows us to study the mass density of the cluster directly and is , with the exception of needing to determine the distance to the cluster using additional optical data , independent of the reddening .",
    "this work accomplishes this by synthesizing and improving upon previously used methods for converting pulsar positions and accelerations into information about the global properties of the system .",
    "as we will see in more detail in sections [ sec : theory ] and [ sec : psr_to_accel ] , the observed variation of the spin and orbital periods ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) can be used to constrain and measure ( respectively ) the acceleration produced by the gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric host cluster ; the second order spin - period derivative ( @xmath23 ) can be used to measure the combined `` jerk '' ( the time derivative of acceleration ) from both the nearby stars and from the overall cluster potential ; in this paper we use this newly available information to derive , for the first time , the positions of the pulsars along their lines of sight relative to the center of the cluster .",
    "the third order and higher spin - period derivatives are dominated by the presence of nearby stars , however , and do not provide additional constraints on the properties of the cluster as a whole .    these measured accelerations and jerks felt by the pulsars due to the cluster potential can be related to a cluster model through the use of a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampler .",
    "this produces a global measurement of the cluster core density , core radius , spectral index of the pulsar density profile ( defined in more detail in section [ sec : initial_fits ] ) , and de - projected positions for each pulsar within the inner few core radii of terzan 5 . using this method ,",
    "additional tests can be performed to determine whether a positional offset is needed with respect to the optical cog of the cluster as well as provide upper limits on the mass of any central black hole in terzan 5 .",
    "as these measurements of the cluster parameters are both reddening independent and calculated using only the gravitating mass of the cluster , we can directly measure the total mass of the cluster at a given radius .",
    "this allows us to provide independent measurements of the mass to light ratio that can be used to discuss the most likely formation scenario for the cluster .",
    "these measurements also allow us to comment on the dominant mass class within terzan 5 , which can play an important role in understanding the formation mechanism for the large population of msps in terzan 5 .      in the remainder of this paper ,",
    "we begin by discussing the observations and timing campaign of terzan 5 ( section [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "we then introduce the models that describe the predicted accelerations and jerks of each pulsar ( section [ sec : theory ] ) and compare these models to globular cluster data produced by the star cluster initializer mcluster @xcite ( section [ sec : simulations ] ) . finally , we convert our pulsar timing data into accelerations ( section [ sec : psr_to_accel ] ) and proceed to derive key cluster parameters for terzan 5 using more traditional timing methods ( section [ sec : initial_fits ] ) as well as with our mcmc models ( sections [ sec : mcmc ] , [ sec : mcmc_47tuc ] , and [ sec : results ] ) , including a comparison of each method against previously quoted values in the literature for 47 tucanae .",
    "we finish the paper by discussing our results in the context of what this means for the physical state and origin of terzan 5 and propose future improvements to our models ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "to date there are @xmath0 known pulsars in terzan 5 , all of which lie within the inner arcminute of the cluster , and the majority within the inner 20 arcseconds .",
    "table [ table : params ] gives some of the basic parameters from the timing of these pulsars , including the range of dates used to produce the timing models .",
    "data were taken with the 100-m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) in west virginia .",
    "observations taken prior to june of 2008 were carried out on the spigot backend @xcite and are summarized in the papers by @xcite and @xcite along with a discussion of twenty four of the pulsars in our sample .",
    "observations taken after this date used the guppi ( green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ) @xcite in the coherent search mode .",
    "both observations with spigot and guppi were taken with approximately 600 mhz of bandwidth after rfi and band - pass removal and were centered at either 1500 mhz or 2000 mhz .",
    "search mode observations using coherent dedispersion accumulate full stokes parameter data in real time before saving the data in a filterbank format .",
    "further details of this process for all @xmath24 pulsars in terzan 5 will be presented in an upcoming paper by @xcite . for this work",
    "we will only discuss @xmath24 of the known pulsars , as stated previously , j1748@xmath122446al does not yet have a timing solution .    of the @xmath24 available pulsars for study in the cluster ,",
    "all have measured first - order spin period derivatives ( due , as already mentioned , to the intrinsic spin - down of the pulsars and the acceleration of the cluster potential ) , 34 have measured second - order spin period derivatives ( due in equal parts to nearby stars and the cluster potential ) , and an additional 13 have a measured third - order spin period derivative or higher - these are not caused by timing noise ( msps generally are very stable rotators ) , being instead caused almost exclusively by the presence and movement of nearby stars .",
    "furthermore , 18 of the @xmath0 pulsars are in binaries , 13 of which have measured orbital period derivatives , which in most cases provide direct measurements of the line of sight acceleration of the system , which is dominated by the cluster potential .",
    "combined , we have an unprecedented amount of information from which we can produce a global model for the physical characteristics of the cluster using pulsar timing",
    "in this section we derive the accelerations and jerks for a king potential @xcite . for the accelerations we show that the nearest stellar neighbor contribution is negligible , leaving us with a single equation based on the mean - field of the cluster .",
    "we discuss the distribution of likelihoods around this mean - field equation in section [ subsubsec : accel_like ] .",
    "@xcite showed that the nearest stellar neighbors produce a non - negligible jerk on pulsars in globular clusters .",
    "we calculate an analytic solution for the characteristic jerk on a pulsar from all the stars at once to account for this effect .",
    "we also calculate the expected distribution of jerks around this characteristic value assuming the inter - stellar distance is much smaller than the size of the cluster .",
    "finally , we discuss the inclusion of a central black hole in the system and show how this may perturb solutions for the innermost stars . in section [ sec : simulations ] we compare our models for the accelerations and jerks to simulated data before applying these methods to terzan 5 .      .",

    "the first argument is that observed variations in the orbital parameters of black widows and redbacks are believed to be stochastic or quasi - periodic in nature @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the changes in the orbital period would be sufficiently monotonic to produce a large apparent acceleration for these systems .",
    "the second argument is that if either of these systems has an intrinsic spin - down rate after subtraction of the apparent cluster acceleration that is not typical of msps , then that may be indicative of a timing model influenced by changing orbital properties .",

    "optical studies have found the system to be highly concentrated however @xcite , therefore we expect that our integrated mass out to a few core radii represents a majority of the mass in the system and is indicative of a lower total mass than found by @xcite . from the results of @xcite , we find the collision rate ( @xmath249 ) of terzan 5 to be slightly smaller than the results of @xcite ( @xmath250 ) .",

    ", we use the results of @xcite to estimate that the current mass of a dwarf galaxy over the past 10 gyrs to be @xmath2511% of its original value . if terzan 5 was a dwarf galaxy at its inception , then its current mass is on the lower end of the commonly accepted mass range for dwarf galaxies of 10@xmath252 @xmath12 10@xmath98 m@xmath3 @xcite after tidal stripping .",
    "in addition to this , the mass to light ratio of milky way ultra - faint satellites are believed to be a few hundred @xcite . even accounting for tidal stripping as the progenitor galaxy enters the milky - way potential , the required change in the mass to light ratio is likely far too large for terzan 5 to have been a dwarf galaxy at its formation .",
    "@xcite also predicted that terzan 5 may be a possible fragment of the milky way s bulge . for milky way - like spiral galaxies , @xcite measured average mass to light ratios much smaller than those of dwarf galaxies .",
    "while we have a large systematic uncertainty in our measured mass to light ratio for terzan 5 , our results agree much better with this formation mechanism as the maximum mass to light ratio will always be much less than that of a disrupted dwarf galaxy .       using the measured accelerations and jerks .",
    "we also find that black hole masses greater than @xmath11 are ruled out by our simulations . ]",
    "we can make future improvement to our method by moving away from a simple king model @xcite to a model that accounts for the underlying imf of the system and better accounts for the entire range of masses in the cluster . at this time our work only approximates a multi - mass system by referencing the pulsars to the dominant mass class in the core .",
    "using a distribution function which accounts for the mass of each star in the globular cluster as well as its position and velocity , each step of our model would be able to more accurately determine the effect neighboring stars have on the pulsars .",
    "it should also be noted that with first light from the next generation of radio telescopes such as meerkat @xcite , the number of timed pulsars in globular clusters , particular those in the southern hemisphere , will increase and allow us to probe the potential of more globular clusters using pulsar timing .      by assigning line of sight positions and spin - down rates for each pulsar at each possible set of cluster parameters",
    ", our work gains an important distinction from previous globular cluster studies using pulsars .",
    "models produced using only the on - sky positions and equation [ eqn : phin_amax ] suffer from a strong covariance in the core density and core radius . using the joint probability of the line of sight position for each pulsar and its expected acceleration , we can produce models that are far less covariant than previous works , as evidenced by comparing figures [ fig : loglike ] and [ fig : accel_only_corner ] .      as a result of determining the density profile for terzan 5 , we also infer the underlying system mass for the @xmath0 pulsars in our study . we have found a mass ratio of pulsars to the dominant mass class of q=@xmath230 . as we expect pulsars to follow the same mass distribution as lmxbs ( inset plot of figure [ fig : cum_dist ] ) , we compare this to the results of @xcite ( @xmath153 ) , finding good agreement between the two results . for a turn - off mass of 0.9 m@xmath3 @xcite",
    "this predicts a system mass for the neutron star population in this study of @xmath201.3 m@xmath3 .    comparing this to the work done by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", we should expect the neutron star mass distribution to be broadly centered on 1.55@xmath253 m@xmath3 .",
    "this is larger than our modeled system masses in our msp population , which must also include the unknown mass of the white dwarf companion present in most of our pulsar systems .",
    "two possible explanations for this discrepancy can be related back to our assumptions of the dominant mass class in the core of the cluster .",
    "the first is that should the core of terzan 5 have a large population of heavy stellar remnants and binaries , the resulting system mass of the pulsars could be much closer to the expected neutron star mass range .",
    "these heavy stellar systems could be comprised of such systems as heavy white dwarfs or hard binaries .",
    "the presence of hard binaries , which is a binary system with a binding energy greater than the average for other binaries in the cluster , can halt gravothermal collapse of the system @xcite and is an ideal means of explaining why terzan 5 has avoided collapse . while the imf of the system will not allow for large numbers of heavy stellar remnants to be formed",
    ", mass segregation would rapidly produce an overpopulation of these systems in the core compared to the entirety of the cluster . if these stars are the dominant mass class of the cluster , they too would provide a much more reasonable system mass for the pulsars according to our measured mass ratio .",
    "the second explanation is that the pulsars in terzan 5 were formed via an electron capture supernovae .",
    "this argument also agrees with the hypothesis that the core may have an abundance of heavy white dwarfs , as these are believed to have been the possible progenitors for the terzan 5 pulsars @xcite .",
    "should this be the case , evidence exists that the median mass distribution of neutron stars formed via electron capture is @xmath254 m@xmath3 .",
    "if the pulsar binaries in our sample are orbitted by a white - dwarf of a few tenths of a solar mass , this agrees well with our measurements .      to date , terzan 5 is one of the best candidates for testing the existence of a central massive black hole given its large number of confirmed pulsars deep within its core . in order to expand this work to other globular clusters , and to improve our limits on the black hole mass for terzan 5",
    ", we would either need to increase the number of available pulsars in each globular cluster or create a more robust model for the physics governing the black hole .",
    "we argue that increasing the number of known pulsars within a globular cluster can improve our constraints on the presence of a black hole for two separate reasons .",
    "the first is that the more pulsars we are able to sample the potential with , the more constraints we can put on the accelerations of each pulsar .",
    "we are therefore better able to discern if a pulsar is truly better fit by being within , or nearly within , the radius of influence of the black hole .",
    "we also argue that the likelihood of finding a pulsar that is very centrally concentrated is increased , which gives us the best constraints on the possible upper mass limit of a black hole .",
    "finding these new pulsars is highly likely as the next generation of radio telescopes turn on and the sensitivity limit for finding weak pulsars is improved @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that search methods for finding weak pulsars will improve over time , as evidenced by the discovery of two new ( but as of yet not well timed enough to include in this work ) pulsars in 47 tucanae @xcite and the three new pulsars discovered in ( one of which does not have a timing solution ) in terzan 5 ( cadelano et al . 2017 ) .",
    "the latter method of improving our model for the black hole physics may be achieved by allowing the black hole to be offset from the center of the cluster and incorporating its contribution to the jerk of each pulsar .",
    "as the black holes mass is much less than the total mass of the cluster , we do not expect it to reside at the exact cog of the system .",
    "incorporating a positional offset in the black hole s position from the cog may allow for individual pulsars to be closer or further from the black hole , thereby experiencing accelerations and jerks that can not be explained by the king model .    without these changes",
    ", we can only take our results as being suggestive in the singular case of terzan 5 that there is an upper limit to the mass of an intermediate mass black hole in the system .",
    "using the mcmc sampler emcee @xcite , we have used 36 msps within the globular cluster terzan 5 to better constrain the cluster parameters , including the core density @xmath163=@xmath255 m@xmath3 pc@xmath4 , the core radius @xmath28=@xmath5 pc , and the spectral index of the neutron star density @xmath141=@xmath236 by using a reddening independent method that probes the true mass density profile and does not rely on an assumed mass to light ratio .",
    "these values agree well with previously obtained quantities using hst and eso - mad , while using a method that allows us to avoid the issue of reddening or stellar counting towards the cluster center .",
    "this is a direct improvement on the previous methods of studying cluster dynamics via pulsar timing as we can better determine the line of sight position of each pulsar in the cluster .",
    "as our density profile for the system is completely derived from the gravitating mass of the system , we are able to provide a more sensitive probe of the true mass of the system .",
    "our methods find an integrated mass of m@xmath2563.5@xmath1710@xmath10 m@xmath3 along our line of sight and within an impact parameter of 1 parsec of the core . without a better luminosity profile",
    "however , we can not provide better estimates for the true mass to light ratio of the system .",
    "the best estimate for the mass to light ratio for the system is m / l@xmath2332.0@xmath237 when using all of the pulsar timing data available , though this quantity is dominated by systematics due to reddening effects .",
    "we find our method for studying the terzan 5 cluster dynamics provides better evidence that terzan 5 is likely a pristine fragment of the galactic bulge @xcite and not the disrupted nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that entered the tidal field of the milky way .",
    "we also find evidence that the core of the system may be comprised primarily of heavy stellar remnants and binaries , which could have provided the needed evolutionary channel to produce the large population of msps observed via accretion induced collapse .",
    "finally we find that terzan 5 has an upper limit on the central black hole mass of @xmath11 .",

    "chandrasekhar ( 1943 ; hereafter c43 ) derives the _ holtzmark _ probability distribution for acceleration due to an infinite distribution of point masses with mean number density @xmath63 .",

    ". a characteristic size of the acceleration , for a star of mass @xmath61 , must be @xmath407 by dimensional analysis .",

    "however , in the discussion following our equation [ eq : ann ] , it was shown that the mean potential of the cluster is likely much larger than the acceleration due to nearest neighbors , hence this joint distribution derived for an infinite medium is not useful in the present context . instead the distribution for the jerks , regardless of the value of acceleration , is derived here .",
    "a star of mass @xmath61 at position @xmath428 and with velocity @xmath429 produces a jerk @xmath430 at the origin .",
    "the physical meaning of jerk is the rate of change gravitational acceleration due to the motion of the particle .",
    "the distribution of stars is taken to be uniform with mean number density @xmath63 , and the velocities are given by a maxwell boltzmann distribution @xmath431 where @xmath62 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "the jerk can then be estimated as @xmath432    as with the distribution for acceleration in equation [ eq : p_of_a ] , the distribution for the three - dimensional jerk @xmath433 due to the @xmath402 stars is @xmath434 \\nonumber \\\\",
