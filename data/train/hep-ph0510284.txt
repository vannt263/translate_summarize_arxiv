    "energy loss by medium - induced gluon radiation is the standard explanation for the suppression of high transverse momentum hadron spectra in nucleus - nucleus collisions compared to p - p collisions .",
    "the description of this effect ( see @xcite and references therein ) considers the rescattering of the emitted gluon with a medium characterized by its length @xmath5 , and by the so - called bdmps transport coefficient @xmath6 . this transport coefficient measures the color field strength in the medium by characterizing the amount of squared transverse momentum transferred from the medium to the hard parton per unit path length .",
    "it is one general expectation of parton energy loss that due to their larger color charge , gluons will radiate more than light quarks which , due to their vanishing mass , will radiate more than heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "heavy - to - light ratios @xmath7 are mainly sensitive to two effects .",
    "first , in hadronic collisions at sufficiently high center of mass energy , light hadrons are predominantly produced by gluons , while heavy mesons have quark parents .",
    "@xmath8 increases due to this color charge effect .",
    "second , heavy quarks radiate less energy than light ones - this mass effect increases @xmath8 further .",
    "there are additional smaller effects which affect @xmath8 and which are discussed in @xcite .",

    "] , which give the probability that a parton traversing a medium characterized by @xmath6 and @xmath5 loses a given fraction of its energy .",

    "after their quenching , partons are fragmented according to standard procedures , see @xcite .",
    "in order to get predictions at rhic energies , the value of the only medium - dependent model parameter , @xmath6 , is fixed from the high-@xmath0 suppression of light hadrons in central au  au at @xmath9 gev .",
