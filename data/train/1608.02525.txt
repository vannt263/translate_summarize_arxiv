    "circumstellar discs are of fundamental importance in astrophysics because they are the birth sites of planet formation .",
    "yet , our current understanding of centrifugally supported discs lack a clear description of how and when they form . the exact role played by magnetic field , in particular ,",
    "remains an unsetlled issue .",
    "various teams have been consistently finding that catastrophic braking may occur when the magnetic field and the rotation axis are aligned @xcite . in such circumstances , magnetic braking can be so intense that the formation of primordial discs at the class-0 stage can be suppressed even for modest magnetizations .",
    "although recent observations have revealed that large discs are rare , if not absent , at class-0 stage @xcite complete inhibition of disc formation can not be considered as a plausible scenario because of ( i ) the assumed aligned configuration @xcite and ( ii ) the ideal mhd assumption @xcite .",
    "indeed , when either misalignment , turbulence or non - ideal mhd effects are included , discs tend to form more easily , although by no means as large as in pure hydrodynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "naively , a broad distribution of disc properties might be expected , depending for instance on the core mass , the amount of rotation or turbulence in the core , the strength of the field and its configuration . in this paper , we derive a theoretical framework which suggests the opposite , i.e. that discs at their early stages are remarkably regulated by a combination of magnetic braking and non - ideal mhd effects , leading to similar sizes . in  [ flux_distrib ] and  [ radius_sec ] , we develop simple analytical arguments leading to our suggestion . in  [ simu_sec ] , we compare these analytical estimates of the disc sizes to a series of collapse calculations corresponding to a large variety of initial conditions .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we first aim at assessing the intensity of magnetic braking .",
    "recent 3d simulations @xcite found that ambipolar diffusion leads to a plateau , i.e. a nearly uniform magnetisation , in the inner part of the collapsing cores , with typical values of the order of 0.1 g for 1 @xmath4 cores , up to @xmath5 0.3 g or so for 100 @xmath4 cores . to understand this property",
    "we assume stationarity , and reduce the problem to one radia dimension ( all quantities in the following are simply written @xmath6 ) . in that case",
    ", the faraday equation reduces to @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the radial velocity , @xmath3 the field vertical ( poloidal ) component and @xmath9 the ambipolar diffusivity .",
    "let us remind that in ideal mhd , flux and mass conservation inside concentric cylinders lead to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the column density and @xmath12 the typical thickness .",
    "assuming mechanical equilibrium , we get @xmath13 and therefore @xmath14 .    because of the complex dependence of the resistivity @xmath9 upon magnetic intensity @xmath15 and density @xmath16 @xcite , eqn .",
    "( [ eq_bz ] ) can not be solved analytically . to get a solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq_bz ] ) , we calculated a table of resistivities for a series of densities and magnetic intensities from @xcite , from which we get @xmath9 for any values by interpolation . to integrate numerically eqn .",
    "( [ eq_bz ] ) , the density and the radial velocity must be specified and we set ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath17 we considered 2 values of the external field , namely @xmath18 and 100 @xmath19 g , as well as 3 densities and velocity field amplitudes , two typical of low - mass cores and one typical of high - mass ones . for the low - mass cores , we took @xmath20 ( i.e. the singular isothermal sphere , sis ) and @xmath21 at @xmath22 au and twice this values ( which corresponds to a faster collapse ) .",
    "for the high - mass core , we took @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ bz ] displays the results . since in real cores ,",
    "the flux distribution is due to a combination of flux freezing and ambipolar diffusion , we explore two cases .",
    "first , we solve eqn .",
    "( [ eq_bz ] ) from the edge to the center of the core ( upper panel ) .",
    "second , we assume flux freezing up to the point where the freefall , @xmath25 , and the ambipolar diffusion times , @xmath26 , become comparable ( @xmath27 g @xmath28 for 100 @xmath19 g and @xmath29 g @xmath28 for 30 @xmath19 g see lower panel ) , then we solve eqn  ( [ eq_bz ] ) ( middle panel ) .",
    "red lines correspond to @xmath21 and dark ones to @xmath24 .",
    "the dashed lines display the low magnetisation cases and solid lines the high magnetisation ones .",
    "as seen , the value of the magnetic intensity outside the core has a weak influence on the value inside it .",
    "a clear transition occurs between a slightly sublinear regime ( where @xmath30 ) to a plateau at @xmath31 g @xmath28 . from fig .  5 of @xcite , we see that indeed @xmath9 displays two different regimes , which correspond to densities respectively below and above @xmath32 g @xmath28 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the freefall time and the ambipolar diffusion time for the 4 low - mass cases displayed by the red lines in the upper and middle panels . clearly , while the freefall time is shorter than the ambipolar diffusion time in the outer part of the core , the reverse is true in the core inner part @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field at the center of the core weakly depends on the physical conditions and remains remarkably constant .",
    "the assumption of stationarity is also well justified as the freefall time is much longer and the ambipolar diffusion one .",
    "these features agree quite well with the 3d simulations performed by @xcite ( their fig .  1 ) and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we see that a slowly collapsing low - mass core ( red lines ) has a smaller central magnetic intensity than a more rapidly collapsing one ( black lines ) .",
    "the massive cores , which have both a large inward velocity and a large density , display even higher central magnetic intensities .    altogether the variations of the magnetic field in the inner part of the core remain limited and weakly depend on the initial conditions .",
    "to obtain an estimate of the disc radius , we examine the relevant timescales and we estimate the various quantities at the disc centrifugal radius location , i.e. at the disc - envelope boundary .",
    "let us stress that the envelope and the disc are connected by an accretion shock that is quite thin .",
    "therefore , outside the disc the gas in its vicinity is nearly in freefall ( see for example figs .  3 and 4 of @xcite ) and the results of sect .  [ flux_distrib ] can be applied .",
    "the first important timescales are the ones that control the evolution of the azimuthal magnetic field , @xmath33 , which is responsible for the magnetic braking . on one hand",
    ", @xmath33 is generated by the differential rotation on a timescale @xmath34 , and on the other hand it is diffused vertically by ambipolar diffusion on a timescale @xmath35 , with @xmath36 where @xmath12 denotes the thickness of the disc .",
    "the second relevant timescales are the magnetic braking one and the rotation time .",
    "they are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the disc radius .",
    "then , we assume that the gas in the neighbourhood of the disc outer part has a keplerian velocity ( in practice it may be a little lower ) and is roughly in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mass of the disc , @xmath41 the mass of the central star and @xmath42 .",
    "finally , the density in the envelope is given by @xmath43 apart for @xmath44 , which is a coefficient on the order of a few , the first term simply correponds to the singular isothermal sphere @xcite while the second one is a correction that must be included when rotation is significant , particularly in the inner part of the envelope close to the disc edge , as discussed in @xcite ( see their appendix and fig .",
    "note that for massive stars , @xmath44 may be up to about 10 as shown in fig .  3 of @xcite .",
    "the disc properties are the result of the balance between various quantities at the disc - envelope boundary .",
    "first of all , as mentioned above , the generation of the toroidal field through differential rotation is offset by the ambipolar diffusion in the vertical direction . from eqns.([tau1 ] ) , with @xmath45 , we get @xmath46    second of all , the braking and the rotation timescales must be of same order , @xmath47 , yielding @xmath48    combining eqs .",
    "( [ far ] ) and  ( [ br ] ) yields @xmath49 while vertical and radial equilibria at the disc outermost limit implies    @xmath50    where , for sake of simplicity , we have assumed @xmath51 in eqn .",
    "( [ rho_exp ] ) .",
    "all these relations lead to @xmath52    the mass of the star / disc system , @xmath53 , grows as the envelope gets accreted .",
    "we take 0.1 @xmath54 as a fiducial value since we are investigating the class-0 phase .    with these values ,",
    "( [ rad ] ) can be rewritten :    @xmath55    the striking result illustrated by eqn .",
    "( [ radius ] ) is the weak dependence of the disc radius upon all involved quantities .",
    "note that , in principle , the magnetic resistivity @xmath2 depends on density ( see fig .  5 of @xcite ) , but this dependence is very shallow .",
    "we find a more pronounced , although still moderate dependence of the radius upon @xmath15 as @xmath56 . in principle",
    "this could introduce some variations among disc radii but , as seen in sect .",
    "[ flux_distrib ] , the magnetic field in the inner part of the envelope of the cores is also regulated by ambipolar diffusion . finally , the radius depends also weakly on the mass .",
    "indeed , as accretion proceeds , the disc is expected to become only about twice larger when the star becomes 10 times more massive , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "we also note that @xmath58 does not enter explicitly in eqn .",
    "( [ radius ] ) , suggesting weak dependence of the disc radius upon the velocity field , be it purely thermal or turbulent ( through an effective sound speed @xmath59 ) , as indeed found in the simulations ( see below ) . in practice ,",
    "some dependence on the various supports enters in the coefficient @xmath44 but since it appears at the power @xmath60 this leads to weak variations . +",
    "it is interesting to compare these trends with the purely hydrodynamical case .",
    "let us consider a spherical cloud of density @xmath61 in solid body rotation at a rate @xmath62 .",
    "when a fluid particle initially at radius @xmath63 reaches centrigugal equilibrium into the disc , its radius is @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the core rotational support .",
    "whereas the mass dependence remains the same as above , the radius now strongly ( quadratically ) depends of the initial rotation rate .",
    "as cores have a typical @xmath66 @xcite , purely hydrodynamical discs should be on average significantly ( typically 5 - 6 times larger ) than the ones we predict .",
    "( 0,8 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 8,0 )",
    "to test the validity of our analytical model , we have performed two series of numerical simulations of non - ideal mhd collapse with ambipolar diffusion , with the ramses code @xcite .",
    "the first type of simulations are identical and/or similar to the ones performed in @xcite .",
    "they have an initial core mass of 1 @xmath4 , a uniform density profile and a uniform magnetic field with a mass - to - flux over critical mass - to - flux ratio of 2 or 5 .",
    "we considered various levels of turbulence , ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , different values of @xmath69 ( thermal over gravitational energy ) and @xmath70 and different angles @xmath71 between the initial magnetic field and the rotation axis .",
    "for the second type of simulations , we considered a massive core of 100 @xmath4 with a uniform temperature of 20  k. the initial density profile follows @xmath72 , where @xmath73  g  @xmath28and the extent of the central plateau is @xmath74  pc .",
    "the initial core radius is @xmath75  pc .",
    "radiative transfer is properly accounted for in the simulations , as in @xcite , and takes into account the feedback from protostellar luminosity using pre - main sequence evolution models @xcite attached to sink particles .",
    "the coarser grid resolution is @xmath76 and we allow for 9 additional levels of refinement , which gives a minimum resolution of 5  au ( the sink accretion radius is then of 20  au ) .",
    "the disc radius is defined according to the criteria described in @xcite .",
    "we first perform an azimuthal average of the rotation , radial velocity and sound speed .",
    "we then select the rings for which both the radial velocity and the sound speed are smaller than 50@xmath77 of the rotation velocity .",
    "figure  [ simu1 ] displays the ratio of the disc radius measured in the simulations at different times over the radius inferred from eqn .",
    "( [ radius ] ) , as a function of the total ( star+disc ) system mass .",
    "the left panel correspond to 1 @xmath4 mass cores and the right one to 100 @xmath4 mass ones .",
    "the central mass corresponds either to the mass of the first larson core in the low - mass models , or to the mass of the sink particle in the high - mass ones . for these latter simulations",
    ", we also considered a value of 0.3 g for @xmath3 in eqn .",
    "( [ radius ] ) , as mentioned in  2.1 . as seen in the figures , the agreement between the theoretical predictions and the simulation is globally quite satisfactory .",
    "most of the points lie between 0.5 and 2 indicating that our theoretical estimate @xmath78 , given by eqn .",
    "( [ radius ] ) , agrees within less than a factor 2 with the numerical results .    for some simulations , notably for the low - mass cores ,",
    "we see a sudden and steep increase of the radius by a factor 2 - 3 above some mass .",
    "we verified that this occurs when the disc and stellar mass reaches about 30 to 50% of the prestellar mass , depending on the various parameters , and the estimated toomre parameter becomes much smaller than unity .",
    "this behaviour thus corresponds to the non - linear development of spiral patterns , which connect to the disc ( see fig .  8 and 11 of @xcite ) , making the definition of a disc radius rather ambiguous .",
    "the dynamics of these patterns clearly differs from the one of an axi - symmetric disc .",
    "in this paper we proposed simple analytical arguments for the formation of early circumstellar discs in collapsing magnetized cores , suggesting that the discs are self - regulated by the magnetic braking and the ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the disc radius estimates derived from the theory have been compared to the values obtained from a series of non - ideal mhd simulations , covering a large range of masses , turbulent support , geometrical configurations and magnetic intensities .",
    "the comparisons show an agreement between the theoretical and numerical results , within less than a factor 2 .",
    "the most striking result is the weak dependence of the disc size upon the core mass , the intensity of the field or the level of turbulence in the core , suggesting small variations between class-0 disc sizes under different environments .",
    "clearly , further observations should be able to probe this prediction .",
