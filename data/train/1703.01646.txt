    "the salesman wants to find a tour of shortest length that visits all of the buyers neighborhoods and finally returns to its initial departure point .",
    "this problem , which is known as the _ tsp with neighborhoods _ ( tspn ) , was introduced by arkin and hassin  @xcite and is a generalization of the classic euclidean traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) , in which the regions , or `` neighborhoods , '' are single points , and consequently is np - hard  @xcite .",
    "our main result is a polynomial - time approximation scheme for regions that are `` fat '' and disjoint in the plane . here",
    ", we use a very weak notion of `` fat ''  a region is _ fat _ if it contains a disk whose size is within a constant factor of the diameter of the region .",
    "we make no assumption about the sizes of the regions .",
    "previous ptas results were known only for the case in which the regions are nearly of equal size .",
    "the best prior approximation ratio for fat regions as defined here was @xmath4 ; for a much more restrictive notion of fatness , an @xmath5-approximation was the best prior result  @xcite .",
    "our result settles in the affirmative , and solves much more generally , an open problem that has been circulating in the computational geometry community for nearly a decade : is there a ptas for tspn on a set of disjoint disks ( or squares ) ?    [ [ related - work . ] ] related work .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    geometric versions of the tsp have attracted considerable attention in the last several years , as it was discovered that the tsp on point sets in any fixed dimension admits a ptas , by results of arora  @xcite , mitchell  @xcite , and rao and smith  @xcite .",
    "see the surveys  @xcite .",
    "the tsp with neighborhoods ( tspn ) is one of the challenging problems that has remained largely `` stuck '' in our ability to approximate optimal solutions .",
    "the best general method remains an @xmath6-approximation  @xcite .",
    "if all regions have the same or comparable diameter , but may overlap , then @xmath5-approximations are known  @xcite .",
    "recently , the most general version of the problem , in which the regions are allowed to be arbitrary ( overlapping ) connected subsets of the plane , has been shown to be apx - hard  @xcite , as has the case of ( intersecting ) line segments of nearly equal lengths  @xcite , suggesting that it is very unlikely that a ptas exists for these versions of the problem . however , it is open whether or not a ptas may exist for the case , e.g. , of _ disjoint _ connected regions in the plane .",
    "attempts to apply the arora / mitchell methods have resulted in only limited successes . in particular , dumitrescu and mitchell  @xcite",
    "have shown that if the regions are all about the same size , have bounded depth , and are fat ( e.g. , if the regions are disks in the plane , with bounded ratio of largest to smallest , with no point lying in more than a constant number of regions ) , then the @xmath1-guillotine method yields a ptas for tspn in the plane that requires time @xmath7 . in a related approach , based on arora  @xcite , feremans and grigoriev  @xcite",
    "have also given a ptas , requiring @xmath8 time , for tspn for regions that correspond to disjoint fat polygons of comparable size in the plane ; the authors observe that their algorithm applies also in higher dimensions .",
    "( actually , the regions to be visited may be disconnected sets of points that each lie within one of the disjoint fat polygons of comparable size ; a ptas for this generalization also follows from @xcite for the 2-dimensional setting . ) using a different technique , mapping the problem to an appropriate `` one - of - a - set '' tsp , de berg et al .",
    "@xcite give an @xmath5-approximation for disjoint `` fat '' convex regions ; elbassioni et al .",
    "@xcite substantially improved the approximation factor ( as a function of the fatness parameter @xmath9 ) and generalized to the discrete case in which the neighborhoods to be visited may be arbitrary sets of points , with each set lying within a fat region , _ not necessarily convex_. most recently , elbassioni , fishkin , and sitters  @xcite give an @xmath5-approximation algorithm for the discrete case in which the corresponding regions are intersecting , convex , and fat , of comparable size .",
    "these constant - factor approximations require a much more restrictive ( stronger ) notion of `` fat '' than we use in this paper : it is required that _ any _ disk that is not fully contained in the region , but with its center in the region , must have a constant fraction of its area inside the region .",
    "this definition rules out `` skinny tentacles , '' which are allowed in our definition of fat regions ; @xcite also rule out any form of overlapping among the regions .",
    "thus , for the class of regions considered in this paper , no previous approximation bound better than @xmath4 was known ; we give a ptas . the original work on the tspn was by arkin and hassin  @xcite , who show that when the neighborhoods are connected and `` well behaved '' ( e.g. , disks , or having roughly equal - length and parallel diameter segments ) , there is an @xmath5-approximation algorithm for the tspn , with running time @xmath10 , where @xmath0 is the total complexity of the @xmath11 neighborhoods",
    "further , they prove a form of `` combination lemma '' that allows one to consider unions of sets of well - behaved neighborhoods ; the resulting approximation factor is given by the sum of the approximation factors obtained for each class individually .",
    "for the general case of connected polygonal neighborhoods , mata and mitchell  @xcite obtained an @xmath12-approximation algorithm , based on `` guillotine rectangular subdivisions , '' with time bound @xmath13 .",
    "gudmundsson and levcopoulos  @xcite have obtained a faster method , which , for any fixed @xmath14 , is guaranteed to perform at least one of the following two tasks ( although one does not know in advance which one will be accomplished ) : ( 1 ) it outputs in time @xmath10 a tour with length at most @xmath12 times optimal ; or ( 2 ) it outputs a tour with length at most @xmath15 times optimal , in time @xmath16 ( if @xmath17 ) or @xmath18 ( if @xmath19 ) . however , no polynomial - time method guaranteeing a constant factor approximation is known for general neighborhoods .",

    "there are    possibly two bridging segments ( the bridge and the region bridge )    specified , as well as up to @xmath227 specified edges ,    @xmath234 , that cross the side and are part of the    information specified in ( a ) .",
    "any region of    @xmath232 that intersects one of    these bridge segments or one of these specified crossing edges is    already visited by the set @xmath128 of edges .",

    "see figure  [ fig : subproblem ] .",
    "because the edge    set @xmath128 is connected and lies entirely within    @xmath40 , we obtain that the subset of this sequence that is    visited outside our subproblem is succinctly representable as a pair    of subsequences :    +    the subset of @xmath240 that is visited    by portions of @xmath128 external to @xmath131 is of the    form    @xmath241 ,    for @xmath242 .",

    "( this is done exactly as is detailed for the euclidean tsp on point    sets in @xcite . )",
    "the algorithm produces an optimal @xmath159-guillotine network that satisfies the required constraints , to visit all unbridged regions ( as well as one region associated with each region bridge ) , and to obey connectivity constraints .",
    "however , the connectivity constraints do not explicitly require that every region bridge be connected in with the rest of the network , and we rely on the region bridge segments to assure that _ all _ regions are indeed visited by the connected network .",
    "thus , at the end of the algorithm , we postprocess our computed network to ensure global connectivity . as in @xcite , we do this simply as follows , augmenting the computed network to make each region bridge connected to it . working bottom - up in the hierarchy ,",
    "we take two sibling subproblems and consider the region bridge ( if any ) along the cut between the subproblems .",
    "we add to the network the boundary of the marked region associated with the region bridge ; by fatness , the perimeter of its bounding box is at most a constant times greater than the length of the region bridge .",
    "further , since the connectivity constraints required that the marked region be visited ( on one side or the other of the cut ) by the network , we know that adding the boundary of the bounding box of the marked region enforces that the region bridge is connected to the network .",
    "the total length added in this process is at most proportional to the lengths of the region bridges ; since the charging scheme ensures that the region bridges need not be more than @xmath245 , we know we can afford to add these cycles around the bounding boxes of marked regions .    in order to end up with a graph having an eulerian subgraph spanning the regions , we use the same trick as done in @xcite : we `` double '' the bridge segments , as well as the region bridge segments , and then require that the number of connections on each side of a bridge segment satisfy a parity condition ( specified as part of the subproblem ) . exactly as in @xcite , this allows us to extract a tour from the planar graph that results from the dynamic programming algorithm ( which gives a shortest possible graph that obeys the specified conditions ) .",
    "the doubled region bridge segments allow the postprocessed network to preserve the eulerian property .",
    "the result is that in polynomial time ( @xmath229 ) one can compute a shortest possible graph , from a special class of such graphs , and this graph spans the regions @xmath28 , and is eulerian , so we can extract a tour .",
    "the running time can be improved to @xmath246 , for a constant @xmath118 independent of @xmath247 , using the method of `` grid - rounded guillotine subdivisions , '' developed in  @xcite .",
