    "uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is one of the most intriguing heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "it exhibits a sharp second - order transition at @xmath1  k , which has pronounced effect on thermodynamic and kinetic properties , @xcite though the neutron diffraction experiments @xcite and the @xmath2-ray magnetic scattering measurements @xcite have produced evidence for only tiny staggered moments @xmath3@xmath4 at @xmath5 .",
    "magnetic excitations observed by inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite are reasonably well explained within the model with exchange interaction in a singlet - singlet van - vleck paramagnet.@xcite this model fails , however , to give a consistent description of the ordering temperature and small ordered moments unless the exchange interaction @xmath6 is accidentally close to a critical value ( see section iv below ) .",
    "a weak antiferromagnetic ordering of a van vleck paramagnet can not produce a measured jump in the specific heat @xcite and an electrical resistivity anomaly .",
    "@xcite these experimental features rather resemble formation of a spin - density wave ( sdw ) , which involves approximately a half of the fermi surface . in its turn ,",
    "the sdw scenario is inconsistent with a longitudinal polarization of the magnetic excitations . as a result of this contradiction",
    ", various theoretical scenarios have been proposed in the past to explain intriguing behavior of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    the proposed theories of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 can be crudely divided into three broad categories .",
    "phenomenological models of the first group @xcite take pragmatic approach and introduce a yet unknown primary or hidden order parameter @xmath7 , which drives the 17.5  k transition and is responsible for a large specific heat anomaly at @xmath8 .",
    "small ordered moments observed in the neutron experiments are described by a secondary ising - like antiferromagnetic order parameter @xmath9 .",
    "depending on the symmetry of the hidden order parameter different coupling terms of the type @xmath10 and @xmath11 are possible in the landau energy functional .",
    "in particular , the model with a bilinear term predicts a nontrivial field - dependence of weak antiferromagnetic moments with an inflection point .",
    "@xcite subsequent neutron measurements have nicely confirmed such a prediction.@xcite    second group of theories consists of specific proposals for the hidden order parameter .",
    "these models are further subdivided into two subgroups .",
    "the first subgroup includes models , in which the primary order parameter breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "these are spin - density waves in higher angular momentum channels , @xcite triple spin correlators,@xcite orbital antiferromagnetism , @xcite and ordering of octupolar moments on uranium sites .",
    "@xcite for such theories the bilinear coupling term with the antiferromagnetic vector is , in principle , possible , though some other crystal symmetries are required to be absent .",
    "the second subgroup includes theoretical models with a time - reversal invariant hidden order parameter such as quadrupolar @xcite or spin nematic ordering.@xcite in such a case the bilinear term is prohibited by symmetry and only a biquadratic interaction exists between the two order parameters .",
    "the last third group of theoretical works includes attempts to realistically describe the microscopic interactions in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "a so called ising - kondo lattice model @xcite describes interaction between conduction electrons in nested bands and local crystal - field split moments .",
    "the mean - field calculation produces both a weak moment and an appropriate value of the transition temperature but does not reproduce the large specific heat jump .",
    "a closely related dual model @xcite considers a subsystem of localized singlet - singlet levels and a subsystem of itinerant electrons with a similar assumption on the nesting condition .",
    "a better description of the thermodynamic properties of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 has been achieved by adding the superexchange and the rkky interactions between local moments .",
    "the field behavior still remains largely inconsistent with the experimental measurements.@xcite further development of the dual model has been recently suggested in ref .  .",
    "note , that the above two microscopic models ( i ) completely neglect the coulomb interaction between charge carries and ( ii ) operate with a single ( antiferromagnetic ) order parameter .",
    "up to now experiments have been unable to distinguish between the competing theoretical proposals .",
    "two potentially important experimental developments published recently include pressure experiments and the nmr measurements .",
    "investigations under hydrostatic pressure@xcite have shown that the @xmath12@xmath13 phase diagram is divided into two regions : a small moment antiferromagnetic phase ( smaf ) at low pressures and a large moment antiferromagnetic phase ( lmaf ) at high pressures with a first - order transition line in between .",
    "such a discovery is generally consistent with phenomenological two order parameter scenarios for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 ( see section iii , below ) .",
    "another experimental finding came out from the nmr measurements .",
    "matsuda and co - workers@xcite have found that a paramagnetic si@xmath14 nmr absorption line persists well below @xmath8 accompanied by two much smaller peaks symmetrically shifted by antiferromagnetic field .",
    "such an observation points at an inhomogeneous para - antiferromagnetic state below the 17.5  k transition .",
    "the peak intensities suggest that about 97% of the sample volume is in a paramagnetic state .",
    "the puzzle of small uranium moments in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 seems to be reinterpreted as due to a phase separation between nonmagnetic state with a hidden order and small antiferromagnetic droplets with ordinary ( large ) value of staggered magnetization .",
    "such a simple explanation of the main mystery of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is quite appealing but leaves without answer question why the inhomogeneous phase exists not only in the vicinity of the first - order transition line at high pressures , but in the whole region of smaf .",
    "the development of the antiferromagnetic bragg peaks right below @xmath1  k seems to be highly accidental in the phase separation scenario .",
    "also , an inflection point in the field dependence of antiferromagnetic bragg peaks can not be explained if small peaks are purely due to a volume effect .",
    "thus , physical implications of the nmr measurements @xcite are not completely straightforward and have to be further clarified .    in this paper , we present a semimicroscopic model for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , which is closely related to the above mentioned dual models,@xcite but operates with two order parameters in the spirit of phenomenological scenarios.@xcite we also consider two magnetic subsystems : ( i ) local crystal - field split moments on u@xmath15 sites and ( ii ) conduction electrons in nested bands .",
    "in contrast to the previous works@xcite we assume that the electron - electron interaction is nonnegligible and that it drives a sdw transition in the nested parts of the fermi surface .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath1  k is associated with @xmath16 and the sdw amplitude @xmath7 plays the role of a primary ( hidden ) order parameter . according to the lsda calculations @xcite the nesting wave - vector is commensurate and corresponds to the experimentally observed two - sublattice antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "the sdw formed in conduction bands is responsible for large changes in thermodynamic and kinetic properties of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . at the same time , we argue that the sdw has a small form - factor and does not create significant bragg reflection",
    ". local polarization of uranium sites by a staggered magnetic field from the sdw induces tiny antiferromagnetic moments .",
    "the magnetic dynamics probed by neutrons is also determined by a localized subsystem .    by making a single assumption about a hidden order parameter with the same symmetry as the observed antiferromagnetic ordering",
    ", we have further derived several results , which allow detailed comparison with available measurements and suggest future experimental tests : ( i ) the @xmath12@xmath13 phase diagram with line of the first order type transition , which terminates at the critical point below @xmath17 ;    \\(ii ) field dependence of staggered magnetization coincides perfectly with the experimental data for a realistic set of microscopic parameters ;    \\(iii ) field dependence of the excitation spectrum .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and discuss various features of the spin - density wave instability specific for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . in section iii , using the phenomenological approach with an appropriate landau energy functional for two coexistent order parameters we investigate the topology of the @xmath12@xmath13 phase diagram of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . in the next section ,",
    "a system of localized crystal - field split singlet - singlet levels is considered under combined influence of a uniform external magnetic field and a staggered `` internal '' field induced by the sdw .",
    "we calculate the field dependences of the staggered magnetization and the excitation spectrum .",
    "comparison to the experimental data is presented in section v , which is followed by discussion and conclusions .",
    "an unusual assumption made by phenomenological theories @xcite is a description of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 with two order parameters having the same symmetry . on the first site such an assumption contradicts to a general spirit of the landau theory of phase transition .",
    "recent investigations of a two - gap superconductor mgb@xmath0 have , however , demonstrated usefulness of the description of the superconducting state by means of two weakly interacting @xmath18-wave condensates of the cooper pairs ( see , for instance , ref .  ) .",
    "the necessary condition for this is a significant mismatch of the pairing interactions in the two bands . in the absence of interband scattering of the cooper pairs ,",
    "each band has its own superconducting transition temperature .",
    "an interband interaction is always present in real metals and leads to a single transition into a state with two different gaps .",
    "the two gaps ( order parameters ) still keep different dependences on temperature , pressure and/or applied magnetic field . in relation to uru@xmath0si@xmath0 ,",
    "the two order parameters @xmath7 and @xmath9 should correspond to two significantly different magnetic subsystems .",
    "we suggest here that the primary order parameter may be an ordinary sdw .",
    "the common objections against a sdw transition are ( i ) smallness of ordered moments and ( ii ) longitudinal polarization of sharp magnetic excitations .",
    "this two properties can be reconciled with a sdw scenario by taking into account specific features of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . in this section",
    "we discuss the former feature , while the properties of magnetic excitations are considered in section iv .",
    "the early experimental works on the specific heat @xcite and the magnetoresistance @xcite in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 have found strong evidences in favor of a charge or a spin - density wave instabilities in the heavy - electron subsystem at @xmath1  k. the fit of the electronic specific heat below the transition indicates that a gap @xmath19  k develops on 40% of the fermi surface at @xmath20 .",
    "this conclusion has received a strong support from the de haas van alphen ( dhva ) measurements.@xcite comparison of the measured dhva frequencies to the _ ab - initio _ band structure shows that two large pieces of the fermi surfaces , band-18 hole and band-19 electron , are not observed at low temperatures , probably due to their partial removal below the ordering temperature .",
    "the above two sheets have nearly spherical shapes and are separated by a nesting wave - vector @xmath21 , which is equivalent to @xmath22 in the brillouin zone of a body - centered tetragonal lattice.@xcite direct calculation of a static momentum - dependent susceptibility@xcite also shows a peak at the commensurate wave - vector @xmath5",
    ".    a fast decrease of the uniform susceptibility@xcite below @xmath8 as well as suppression of the transition temperature @xmath8 and the bulk gap @xmath23 by applied magnetic field @xcite also point to a charge- or a spin - density wave state . for the cdw",
    "the zeeman splitting degrades the nesting of the fermi surfaces and reduces a mean - field transition temperature@xcite in a way , which is analogous to the paramagnetic limit effect in superconductors .",
    "by contrast , an isotropic sdw involves coupling of bands with opposite spin and the nesting is not affected by a magnetic field .",
    "a strong spin - orbit coupling in heavy - fermion materials creates momentum dependence of the @xmath24-factor .",
    "if the nesting condition @xmath25 is satisfied for particular sheets of the fermi surface it is not generally fulfilled for the zeeman shift @xmath26 .",
    "hence , in metals with strong spin - orbit coupling an sdw state is also suppressed by the paramagnetic effect .",
    "the mean - field theory of a sdw formation in ideally nested electron and hole fermi surfaces@xcite resembles to a large extent the bcs theory .",
    "the relative jump of the specific heat at @xmath27 is estimated by the bcs value @xmath28 , which is compatible with the experimental value @xmath29 once additional strong - coupling effects are taken into account .",
    "the modulation of the spin density at @xmath30 are given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density of states per one spin direction .",
    "estimating @xmath33 , we find that ordered moments normalized per one electron constitute a small fraction of the bohr magneton @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite such a reduction has a transparent physical meaning : only electrons ( holes ) within a thin layer of width @xmath35 around the fermi surface participate in the formation of ordered moments .",
    "thus , affecting strongly thermodynamic and kinetic properties , a weak - coupling sdw order has a small form - factor and does not produce significant magnetic bragg scattering .",
    "this fact has not been so far appreciated in the literature on uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "there are several additional factors , which complicate the simple picture drawn above .",
    "first , the perfect nesting between different bands does not appear in real materials .",
    "absence of perfect nesting acts as a depairing effect reducing gradually both the transition temperature and the zero-@xmath13 gap and enhancing the residual density of states .",
    "obviously , such an effect does not change the conclusion about a small form - factor , but may reduce the jump in the specific heat compared to the bcs value .",
    "in order to show that partial nesting does not modify the previous estimate , we refer to a similar situation in superconductors with paramagnetic ( depairing ) impurities .",
    "using the abrikosov - gorkov theory , skalski _",
    "et al_.@xcite have calculated the effect of paramagnetic impurities on various characteristics of an @xmath18-wave superconductor .",
    "their results indicate that in a wide range of impurity concentration , the jump in the specific heat and the transition temperature are suppressed at approximately the same rate , hence , preserving the bcs estimate for the relative specific heat jump .",
    "second , the electron mass enhancement in heavy fermion materials ( @xmath36 in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 ) can significantly reduce the fermi energy scale @xmath37 .",
    "however , simultaneously with a mass renormalization , an interaction with spin fluctuations reduces strongly the spectral weight of heavy quasiparticles@xcite adding an extra small factor @xmath38 to eq .",
    "( [ szq ] ) , which completely compensates the factor @xmath39 in the density of states and further reduces value of the ordered moments .",
    "finally , according to the band structure calculations @xcite uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is a compensated metal with equal number of electrons and holes . the number of carriers in the two bands undergoing a sdw transition is smaller than one , when normalized to the number of u - atoms .",
    "this yields an extra reduction factor , since the neutron scattering experiments report the ordered moments normalized per one uranium .",
    "the above arguments can , in our view , convincingly explain why small antiferromagnetic bragg peaks in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 are consistent with a sdw instability . in the following",
    "we assume that due to nesting between some parts of the fermi surface in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 the commensurate sdw state is formed below the critical temperature @xmath8 and that the sdw amplitude @xmath40 plays the role of a hidden order parameter in the problem .",
    "the microscopic dual models @xcite assume that conduction electrons are noninteracting and operate , therefore , with a single order parameter , which leaves no place for the phase diagram with smaf and lmaf regions . in our scenario ,",
    "temperatures of intrinsic phase transitions in itinerant and localized magnetic subsystems are different functions of @xmath12 and they may interchange their order under pressure . as a result , a line of first - order transitions appears naturally between the two ordered states , where one order parameter prevails over another , see fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the landau free - energy for two interacting order parameters can be written as @xmath41 a special bilinear coupling term is allowed only if the two parameters transform according to the same irreducible representation , otherwise @xmath42 .",
    "for nonzero @xmath43 , the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath9 do not correspond to two different types of symmetry breaking .",
    "rather they describe two weakly coupled magnetic subsystems of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 in a way , which is reminiscent of the ginzburg - landau description of the multigap superconductivity in mgb@xmath0.@xcite the bilinear term corresponds , then , to a polarization of local moments by a spin - density wave .",
    "generally , in addition to the bilinear term @xmath10 there are possible other coupling terms in the landau functional : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these terms can exist even if @xmath7 and @xmath9 transform according to different irreducible representations ( though @xmath7 has to break the time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "the @xmath46 term leads , for example , to a small antiferromagnetic component in a state with @xmath47 , even if @xmath42 .",
    "the induced @xmath9 component grows in such a case as @xmath48 , while the neutron diffraction experiments find a standard mean - field exponent @xmath49.@xcite this observation suggests that the @xmath10 coupling plays a dominant role and , hence , the phenomenological coefficients for @xmath44 and @xmath45 terms have the same smallness as @xmath43 .",
    "in such a case , a simple linear transformation allows to exclude such terms form the landau functional without modifying significantly the physical meaning of @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath50 the functional ( [ landau ] ) has a form commonly found in the theory of phase transitions .",
    "assuming that only coefficients @xmath51 depend on temperature and pressure , the energy ( [ landau ] ) describes a phase diagram with two crossing lines of second - order transitions determined by @xmath52 .",
    "the transition line from a paramagnetic state @xmath17 has a kink at the crossing point .",
    "presence and nature of extra transitions in the order state , where @xmath53 , depend on quartic terms . for @xmath54 or for a weak repulsion between @xmath7 and @xmath9 , there are two other lines of second - order transitions transition emerging from the crossing point .",
    "they separate two states with pure ordering , _",
    "i.e. _ ,   @xmath47 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , from a mixed phase with @xmath47 and @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the phase diagram in this case has a tetracritical point . for @xmath58 or for a strong repulsion between two components",
    ", the mixed phase does not appear .",
    "instead , there is a single line of first - order transitions in the @xmath12@xmath13 plane given by @xmath59 , which approaches the kink ( crossing ) point from the ordered side , see the left panel in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .    in the following",
    "we discuss effect of nonzero @xmath43 on the two order parameter functional ( [ landau ] ) : problem , which , to our knowledge , has not been considered so far .",
    "once @xmath60 , the two order parameters appear simultaneously on a single transition line given by @xmath61 .",
    "the transition temperature from a paramagnetic state @xmath17 has now a smooth pressure dependence and does not exhibit a kink . at @xmath62 ,",
    "the induced antiferromagnetic component behaves as @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "a small coefficient @xmath65 implies weak ordered moments , while @xmath7 gives rise to a large anomaly in the specific heat at @xmath8 .",
    "we identify this phase with a small moment antiferromagnetic ( smaf ) phase of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .    in order to investigate the possible ordered states and phase transitions below @xmath17 ,",
    "one has to minimize eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) with respect to both @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "this gives a system of two coupled cubic equations , which is easily solved numerically , but does not allow full analytic solution .",
    "still , simple analytic arguments can be used to prove stability of the first - order transition line for @xmath60 and @xmath58 .",
    "[ for @xmath66 , the bilinear term stabilizes the mixed phase ( @xmath47 and @xmath57 ) right below @xmath17 . ]",

    "the condition for the absence of the mixed phase at @xmath50 is @xmath73 , while the position of the first - order transitions line in the @xmath12@xmath13 plane is given by @xmath74 .",
