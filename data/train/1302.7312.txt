    "flux tubes in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) play important roles in many interesting places like confinement , quark pair creation , hadron structure and phase transitions . in the dual - superconductor description of qcd vacuum @xcite",
    ", the chromoelectric field lines between color sources , like a quark and antiquark pair , are squeezed into a narrow flux tube along the line connecting the pair .",
    "the resulting potential is linear and consequently leads to color confinement . on the other hand",
    ", these flux tubes can provide chromoelectric field strong enough for quark pair creation , via the usual schwinger mechanism @xcite ( note that this is a non - perturbative particle creation mechanism ) @xcite .",
    "qcd flux tubes are also well - studied in the formation of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "another intensively studied object , is the topological charge and its distribution in the qcd vacuum .",
    "different topological defects in the qcd vacuum have been explored by large-@xmath0 methods , holographic qcd and lattice simulations . among different topological defects vortices",
    "are particularly interesting , especially when we consider its possible connection the flux tubes and how it interacts with the quarks . for example , the localization of quark zero modes on the topological defects leads to an interesting phenomenon  anomaly inflow @xcite which could shed some light on the study of topological charge distribution in the qcd vacuum .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that chiral fermion zero modes are localized on an axion string or a domain - wall embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime . when coupled to some external gauge potential",
    ", gauge anomaly appears on the string or domain - wall and it is cancelled by the gauge variation of an effective action , a chern - simons type coupling living in the bulk of the higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a new description for the qcd flux tubes and to study how topological charge emerges via the anomaly inflow mechanism .",
    "our formulation is based on using a new set of variables for the non - abelian gauge theory ( cho - faddeev - niemi ) @xcite , i.e. the usual gauge potential @xmath1 splits into two new gauge potentials @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are convenient and efficient in studying both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking . as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gauge potential @xmath2 alone is responsible for the wilson loop and the polykov loop at the operator level , while the potential @xmath3 may be integrated out in the presence of dynamical quarks to produce a nonlocal four - fermion nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) interaction , which can be used to study chiral symmetry breaking as an effective lagrangian method @xcite .",
    "this decomposition and the resultant physics are more complicated in our formulation , since it describes the gauge configuration of a flux tube with strong chromoelectric fields ( plus chromomagnetic fields ) .",
    "in fact if the flux - tube field lines are strong enough the chiral symmetry can be restored @xcite .",
    "therefore the quark condensates inside the flux tube vanishes , i.e. @xmath4 , while outside the flux tube the qcd vacuum has @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore if this configuration carries a nonzero topological charge , it is possible for the quark condensates to form a vortex with a nonvanishing winding number , or even vortex lattice .",
    "we then can show that the chiral anomaly emerges in the bulk as a chern - simons effective action term .",
    "when chromomagnetic fields are included , this formulation can also be used to describe the chiral magnetic effect in qgp @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : sec .",
    "ii is to introduce the cho - faddeev - niemi decomposition of non - abelian gauge theories ; sec .",
    "iii has a brief review of the callan - harvey anomaly inflow mechanism ; we then study chromoelectric flux tubes in details in sec iv ; as an application quark creation due to chiral magnetic effect are considered in sec .",
    "v ; discussions and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in this section we briefly review the reformulation of a non - abelian gauge theory in terms of a set of new variables , or cho - faddeev - niemi decomposition @xcite .",
    "we consider the su(2 ) case for simplicity and the generalization to su(3 ) or su(n ) can be found in @xcite . as shown in @xcite",
    "this decomposition is quite convenient in studying the crossover of the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking and also the topological feature of the gauge configurations .",
    "the decomposition reads @xcite @xmath6 where the new variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 are defined as @xmath7 \\cr b_{\\mu } & = & i g^{-1 } [ \\nabla_{\\mu } { \\bf n } , { \\bf n}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 $ ] and a unit vector @xmath9 in the color space , satisfying @xmath10 one can define a field strength @xmath11\\ ] ] in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath9 @xmath12 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the original field strength can be decomposed as well @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are defined as @xmath16 with @xmath17 $ ] . to see the abelian character of this decomposition , we follow ref . @xcite and introduce a basis @xmath18 in the @xmath19 color space .",
    "the color vector @xmath9 can be identified with @xmath20 .",
    "then the gauge potential @xmath2 can be rewritten as @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents a classical qcd vacuum @xmath23 since the corresponding field strength vanishes .",
    "the chromomagnetic potential @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 and the chromoelectric potential @xmath26 .",
    "the field strength @xmath27 becomes @xmath28 where the chromoelectric field strength @xmath29 and the chromomagnetic field strength @xmath30 are given by @xmath31 @xmath32 { \\bf n}^2\\ ] ] respectively , where the last term vanishes except for the region where the topological defect is located , as it can be seen in the next section when we consider a stringy configuration .",
    "the action of pure yang - mills theory then becomes @xmath33 \\cr   & = & \\int d^4 x \\bigg [ - \\frac{1}{4 } \\big [ g_{\\mu\\nu}^2 + b_{\\mu\\nu}^2 + 2 ( \\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\mu } b_{\\nu})^2   \\cr & & + 4 ( g_{\\mu\\nu } { \\bf n } + \\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\mu } b_{\\nu } ) \\cdot b_{\\mu\\nu } \\big ] \\bigg ]   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 $ ] and we have used the reduction condition @xcite @xmath35 this condition also makes the dynamical degrees of freedom of the new variables match with those of original gauge potential .",
    "it is useful to rewrite the action in the form of @xcite @xmath36\\ ] ] with the operator @xmath37 defined as @xmath38 the quark part of the qcd action in terms of the new variables will be given and studied in sec .",
    "the localization of chiral fermion zero modes on vortices or domain - walls brings an interesting topic  anomaly inflow mechanism @xcite into the study of topological charge distribution in the qcd vacuum .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that chiral fermion zero modes are localized on an axion string or a domain - wall embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime . when coupled to some external gauge potential , gauge anomaly appears on the string or domain - wall and it is cancelled by the gauge variation of an effective action , a chern - simons type coupling living in the higher dimensional spacetime . in general ,",
    "chiral anomaly in @xmath39-dimensions specifies the coupling between the gauge fields and the vortex .",
    "this coupling leads to the net flux of gauge charge into the vortex , cancelling the gauge anomaly due to the chiral zero - mode fermions in @xmath40-dimensions .",
    "this is how the chiral anomaly in @xmath39-dimensions is related to the gauge anomaly in @xmath40-dimensions . for geometric point of view",
    ", they are related by the stora - zumino descent equations @xcite .",
    "let us take callan and harvey s axion - string model as an example @xcite an axion string , described by a complex scalar field @xmath41 , is embedded in a four - dimensional bulk space .",
    "fermions coupled to the string have chiral zero modes localized on it .",
    "if the fermions are also coupled to some gauge potential , there is a two - dimensional gauge anomaly due to the fermion zero modes @xmath42 which can only be cancelled by a chern - simons coupling similar to ( [ csphi ] ) @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the phase angle of the axion field @xmath45 .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath46 contains the chern - simons current @xmath47 which comes from the chern - simons form @xmath48 .",
    "integrated by parts it gives a term resembling the qcd @xmath44-term @xmath49 with the help of the identity @xmath50 note that the topological charge density ( [ tc ] ) is gauge invariant , while the current - current coupling ( [ csphi ] ) is not .",
    "this is because the chern - simons form transforms under the gauge transformation @xmath51 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the gauge variation of ( [ csphi ] ) is crucial in the anomaly - inflow mechanism , as it can be seen from the descent equation @xcite @xmath52 which relates the four dimensional axial anomaly @xmath53 and the lower - dimensional gauge anomaly @xmath54 on the topological defect @xmath55 .",
    "note that the phase angle @xmath56 is ambiguous at the origin and hence @xmath57 is singular @xcite @xmath58 hence we can not apply the identity @xmath59 in ( [ descent ] ) .",
    "there is a subtlety in using covariant anomaly or consistent anomaly and it has been clarified in @xcite .",
    "we will show how this anomaly inflow mechanism on the string - like topological defects can be applied to the qcd flux tubes in the next section .",
    "similar applications for the membrane - like topological defects can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , where we have studied the qcd membranes .",
    "chromoelectric flux tubes can be generated by quark pair creation , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the process of hadron production in @xmath60 annihilation . given enough energy , a quark pair @xmath61",
    "is created at some point and then move away in opposite direction at a speed @xmath62 close to the speed of light ( @xmath63 ) . the chromoelectric flux tube is then formed when the distance between the quark pair becomes @xmath64 or more .",
    "new quark pairs can be produced in a cascade way .",
    "the confining constant chromoelectric field inside the flux tube pulls the new quark pairs apart until shorter flux tubes with lower energy form .",
    "we first consider a simplified case : there already exists a static pair of quark and antiquark @xmath61 and a chromoelectric flux tube connects the @xmath61 pair .",
    "we also assume that the flux tube is stable again the quantum fluctuations .",
    "these are possible scenarios : firstly the chromoelectric flux tube is treated just like an ordinary electric flux tube , although the color degree of freedom has to be included .",
    "this has been studied in details in @xcite and other references , therefore we focus on another scenario , where the quark condensates are taken into account , and their interactions with quarks are studied as in the usual nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) effective methods in chiral symmetry breaking and other issues . just like",
    "a magnetic monopole - antimonopole pair creates a string - like region of normal conduction in a superconductor , the quark - antiquark pair creates a region where the chiral quark condensate vanishes , i.e. @xmath4 , while outside the chromoelectric flux tube the qcd vacuum has @xmath5 .",
    "this is easy to understand since in sufficiently strong chromoelectric field , the @xmath61 pairs can be pulled apart and hence the quark condensates disappear . as it will be shown later in this section ,",
    "it is possible for quark condensates to form a vortex in the chromoelectric flux tubes .",
    "this is similar to the phenomenon in condensed matter physics that rotating bose - einstein condensates can form vortices when the rotating speed goes beyond some critical value .    using the new variables introduced in sec .",
    "ii , the quark part of the qcd action becomes @xcite @xmath65\\ ] ] integrating out @xmath3 yields the gauged njl effective action @xmath66 \\big ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 are matrices in dirac , color and flavor spaces .",
    "the non - local structure of the njl coupling is not needed in this paper and we only consider the standard ( gauged ) njl limiting case where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the usual njl four - fermion coupling constant .",
    "the effective njl action , which must keep the original symmetry of qcd action , can be parametrized as @xmath70 \\psi\\ ] ] where the ellipsis includes contributions from the vector and pseudovector channels .",
    "so far this is quite similar to the usual njl formulation except the  gauged \" piece , i.e. the terms with the gauge potential @xmath2 . the usual njl lagrangian ( perhaps even with some extensions ) does not lead to a dual superconductor picture so we have to assume that the @xmath2-related abelian dominance lead to quark confinement . as mentioned before the wilson loop operator and the polyakov loop operator only depend on @xmath2 but we will not consider the confinement problem in the present paper . here",
    "we only need assume that the chromoelectric field lines are squeezed into tubes and hence the force between a quark - antiquark pair is linear . for the quark condensates to form a vortex , @xmath71 should satisfy a boundary condition @xmath72 and this suggests that we choose @xmath73 for constant ( chromo)electric and/or ( chromo)magnetic background , this effective potential has been calculated before ( see @xcite for example ) and one of the conclusions is that when the chromoelectric field exceeds some critical strength , say @xmath74gev / fm @xcite , the chiral symmetry is restored inside a chromoelectric flux tube , and we then have a normal phase with chiral symmetry , similar to the normal phase inside the magnetic flux tube of a superconductor .",
    "therefore for strong chromoelectric flux tubes , the boundary condition ( [ vortexbc ] ) can be satisfied and it is possible that the quark condensates form a non - trivial topological defect  a vortex at the same region where the chromoelectric flux tube is located .",
    "moreover , vortex lattice can be formed in the qcd vacuum just like those abrikosov lattices in type - ii superconductors .",
    "a couple of remarks are in order : first , the boundary condition can not guarantee the existence of vortex solution , as a trivial configuration with a vanishing winding number is still a possible solution ; second , these vortices emerges at _ quantum _ level , and they are not solutions of the qcd vacuum at the classical level , which may not exist .",
    "now let us study the effective lagrangian ( [ eff ] ) in the background of ( [ vortexbc ] ) and a longitudinal gauge potential @xmath75 for example , @xmath76 corresponds to an electrical field @xmath77 background along the @xmath78-axis ( or the @xmath79-axis ) and we will consider more general configurations in the next section . writing @xmath80 in terms of @xmath81 , the dirac equation splits into two equations , similar to @xcite @xmath82 which can be converted to equations of motion for a two - dimensional spinor @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 satisfies @xmath86",
    ". then solution to ( [ dirac4d ] ) obtains the same exponential profile as in ref.@xcite @xmath87\\ ] ] and @xmath88 .",
    "note that the difference between equations ( [ dirac4d ] ) , ( [ dirac2d ] ) and those in ref.@xcite is that we have included the gauge potential @xmath2 explicitly .",
    "the exponential profile in ( [ 4dpsi ] ) shows that chiral zero modes are localized on the flux tube",
    ". however , let us keep in mind that this is based on the assumption ( [ az ] ) .",
    "other gauge configurations could modify the exponential profile or even remove it , which indicates the transverse motion of quark zero modes .",
    "here there is also a two - dimensional chirality is defined by the @xmath89 which is the two - dimensional analogue of @xmath90 in four dimensions . from the eqt .",
    "( [ dirac2d ] ) we see that chiral zero fermions are coupled to a gauge field and it is well known that a gauge anomaly appears in the flux tube @xcite @xmath91 this seems to be a problem since the original theory qcd should not have gauge anomaly in the four dimensional spacetime . the gauge anomaly on the vortex configuration",
    "is actually cancelled by a topological term .",
    "the gauge potential @xmath2 can be rewritten as @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the @xmath94 potential introduced in ( [ u1 ] ) @xcite and the corresponding field strength @xmath95 @xmath96 which shows the _ abelian _ character of @xmath97 . as it is calculated in @xcite ,",
    "the induced current in the qcd vacuum is @xmath98 and it leads to an effective action @xmath99 where the chern - simons current is @xmath100 it is easy to see that the gauge variation of @xmath101 cancels precisely the gauge anomaly on the vortex configuration .",
    "therefore we have shown that a strong chromoelectric flux tube may correspond to a vortex configuration of quark condensates .",
    "quark zero modes located at the vortex becomes chiral which leads to gauge anomaly in the two - dimensional defect .",
    "this can only be cancelled by a topological term ( chern - simons ) in the bulk of the four - dimensional spacetime and hence relates the gauge anomaly in the vortex to the chiral anomaly in the bulk . from the current inflow point of view one",
    "may consider the flux tube as an _ ",
    "anomaly battery\"_. it is charged by the current ( [ induc ] ) whose only non - vanishing component is @xmath102 ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "it is also interesting that this current flows in the direction perpendicular to the chromoelectric field @xmath103 like that of the hall effect , as first noticed by callan and harvey @xcite .",
    "[ fluxtubeinflow ]",
    "in this section we use our formulation to describe an interesting phenomenon in quark creation  the chiral magnet effect @xcite . we will skip the chirality - conserving process since this is just the usual pair creation in strong ( chromoelectric ) fields @xcite via the schwinger pair - creation mechanism @xcite , where the anomaly does not seem to play a role .",
    "the chiral magnet effect is different .",
    "the formation of qgp also involves color flux tubes . during the ultra - relativistic collision of heavy nuclei ,",
    "net color charges develop and consequently color flux tubes connect these color charges .",
    "quark - antiquark and gluon pairs are produced from the color fields via the schwinger mechanism as mentioned before .",
    "pair creation can happen in chromoelectric flux tubes and be enhanced when ( chromo)magnetic field has a non - vanishing component in the same direction of the chromoelectric field , more precisely , @xmath104 .",
    "this is called chiral magnetic effect @xcite .",
    "there are different approaches in understanding chiral anomalies , e.g. perturbation theory , path integral and index theorem .",
    "the pair creation explanation in @xcite is appealing and particularly suitable in our case . from eqt .",
    "( [ dirac2d ] ) and @xmath105 @xmath106 which can be readily converted to @xmath107 for a uniform chromoelectric field @xmath108 , this reduces to the case studied in @xcite one can apply a very simple argument which leads to the axial anomaly : the creation / annihilation rate of right / left - handed particles per unit time and unit length depends on the change of the fermi surface .",
    "according to @xcite the annihilation rate of the left - handed particles is @xmath109 based on the dispersion relation from ( [ dirac2dl ] ) @xmath110 and the classical equation of a charged particle in a uniform electric field @xmath111",
    ". therefore eqt .",
    "( [ abj ] ) gives the axial anomaly in two - dimensional spacetime @xmath112 and the axial anomaly is @xmath113 notice that in the uniform ( chromo)electric field case , @xmath114 this can be generalized to the four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "assuming that at @xmath115 the number of right - handed quarks is equal to the number of left - handed quarks . if the winding number of the vortex configuration is @xmath116 , we then should have @xmath116 chiral quarks created inside the flux tube at @xmath117 . again",
    "it will lead to the gauge anomaly and need the anomaly inflow .",
    "this is more like a  recharging \" process for  chiral batteries \" , which was first discussed in @xcite .    to study the chiral magnet effect we add a constant color magnetic field in the @xmath79-direction .",
    "take the symmetric gauge @xmath118 and solve the dirac equation in the new background with both constant color electric and magnetic fields @xmath119 the profile of the quark zero modes now have an extra @xmath120-dependent factor @xmath121\\ ] ] ( more general cases like time - dependent @xmath122 fields can be studied in a similar way ) .",
    "now the direction of color magnetic field in the @xmath79-axis matters and it competes with the suppression factor due to the @xmath123 factor .",
    "therefore we can not treat the configuration as a string and must solve the equation in the four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "however , it is easy to see that if color electric and magnetic fields are ( anti)parallel , the topological charge density @xmath124 the winding number of a gauge configuration @xmath125 and hence the chirality is not conserved @xmath126 in order to have a complete analysis we need consider strong or moderate chromomagnetic fields and the initial states could be the lowest landau level but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we close by pointing out that there are other formulation , e.g. the dual formulation in @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 are two real scalar fields .",
    "the degree of freedom of the gauge potential can be moved around among the fields @xmath9 and @xmath129 and @xmath130 and @xmath9 are dual to each other . with proper vevs for the above quantities , a ( dual ) abelian - higgs model can be constructed @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see how this is connected to our formulation .",
    "note that these variables appear at the classical level while some dynamical degrees of freedom in our model emerges at the quantum level .",
    "to summarize , we applied the anomaly - inflow mechanism to the studies of chromoelectric flux tubes , quark ( pair)-creation and chiral magnetic effect , using new qcd variables from the cho - faddeev - niemi decomposition . at quantum level , quark condensates in the qcd vacuum",
    "may form vortex - like structure at the region where a chromoelectric flux tube is located .",
    "quark zero modes trapped in the vortex are chiral and generate two - dimensional gauge anomaly . to cancel this anomaly an effective chern - simons type action and",
    "hence a topological charge density term naturally appears .",
    "this scenario can also be used to study anomaly enhanced quark - pair creation , chiral magnetic effect and etc . in this paper",
    "we only considered straight string - like color flux tubes and their descendants .",
