    "in the past few years , the discovery of superconductivity in layered cobalt oxides na@xmath5coo@xmath6h@xmath7o@xcite has attracted considerable attention among the condensed matter physics society .",
    "although the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath8k)@xcite is very low , the layered electronic structure and the dome - shaped behavior of @xmath9 suggest this hydrated compound may be another doped mott insulator@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cuprate superconductors with a square lattice of cuo@xmath7 planes , the parent compound na@xmath5coo@xmath7 is composed of two - dimensional ( 2d ) coo@xmath7 layer with triangular geometry . this geometry frustration results in some novel electronic and magnetic phases , for instance , the anderson s resonating valence state @xcite and the strong topological frustration phases@xcite . with the doping variation ,",
    "na@xmath5coo@xmath7 displays rich and complicated phase diagram@xcite .",
    "in particular , superconductivity appears around @xmath10 when water molecules are intercalated between the coo@xmath7 layers@xcite .",
    "although extensive researches on this compound have been done in both experimental and theoretical sides , the doping dependent magnetic properties still remain unclear .",
    "the local spin density approach@xcite predicted ferromagnetic coupling within 2d coo@xmath7 layer for nearly all electron doping @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , up to now , only at large doping neutron scattering studies and time - of - flight experiments on na@xmath12coo@xmath7 and na@xmath13coo@xmath7@xcite respectively , present low - energy fluctuations characteristic of a - type antiferromagnetism : antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic layers . however , with the decreasing of na content , a series of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)@xcite and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr)@xcite as well as knight shift measurement@xcite show the presence of strong 2d antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin correlations and suggest the possibility of the spin - singlet superconductivity .",
    "that is to say the 2d af spin correlations may be realized in the region of small @xmath14 value for na@xmath5coo@xmath7 .",
    "starting from ab - inito band structure calculations , korshunov and co - workers have estimated a certain critical concentration @xmath15 , below which the magnetic susceptibility within the coo@xmath7 plane shows a tendency towards af fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the recent correlation effects on the doped na@xmath5coo@xmath7 via a cellular cluster approach has reconfirmed and explained such in - plane magnetic transition from fm tendencies towards to af@xcite .",
    "recently , the surface - sensitive angle resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments@xcite observe a doping - dependent evolution of the fermi surface , which is found to be centered around the @xmath16 point with a mostly @xmath17 characterister and no sign of six pockets resulting from the @xmath18 band predicted by local density approximation calculation@xcite for a wide of na concentrations .",
    "this indicates the importance of the electronic corrections in the doped na@xmath5coo@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , as discussed by many researchers@xcite , an effective single band low - energy model suffices to capture the essential physics of electron - doped cobaltate na@xmath5coo@xmath7 . with this consideration in mind ,",
    "in this paper we also take a single band @xmath0-@xmath1 model as our starting point to discuss its unusual dynamical spin response .",
    "since the af fluctuations within the coo@xmath7 planes may be realized in the low electron doping range , we are focusing on such region in our calculations below .",
    "we find that the particularly universal behaviors of integrated dynamical spin structure factor seen in the doped cuprates , are absent in the doped cobaltates , indicating the presence of the normal state gap .",
    "we also find that the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath2 divided by @xmath3 reduces with decreasing temperatures in the temperature region above 0.2@xmath1@xmath450k , then follows a curie - weiss - like behavior at the temperature less than 50k originating from the strong af fluctuations , in qualitative agreement with experimental observations@xcite .",
    "our results also show that af fluctuations within the coo@xmath7 plane gradually weaken with increasing electron doping .",
    "it has been argued that the essential physics of the doped coo@xmath7 plane is contained in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a triangular lattice@xcite , @xmath19 where the summation is over all sites @xmath20 , and for each @xmath20 , over its nearest - neighbor @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath24 is the spin operator with @xmath25 as the pauli matrices , @xmath26 is the chemical potential , and the projection operator @xmath27 removes zero occupancy , i.e. , @xmath28 . in the past fifteen years , some useful methods have been proposed to treat the no double occupancy local constraint in hole doped cuprates . in particular , a fermion - spin theory based on the partial charge - spin separation has been developed to study the physical properties of doped cuprates@xcite , where the no double occupancy local constraint can be treated properly in analytical calculations . to apply this theory in the electron doped cobaltates , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( 1 ) can be rewritten in terms of a particle - hole transformation @xmath29 as , @xmath30 supplemented by the local constraint @xmath31 to remove double occupancy , where for convenience , we have set @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the hole creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "then the hole operators can be decoupled as , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in the charge - spin separation fermion - spin theory@xcite , where the spinful fermion operator @xmath37 describes the charge degree of freedom together with some effects of the spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped electron itself ( charge carrier ) , while the spin operator @xmath38 describes the spin degree of freedom ( spin ) , then the single occupancy local constraint , @xmath39 , is satisfied in analytical calculations . in this charge - spin separation fermion - spin representation ,",
    "the low - energy behavior of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( 2 ) can be expressed as@xcite , @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the electron doping concentration . in this case , the magnetic energy ( @xmath1 ) term in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is only to form an adequate spin configuration , while the kinetic energy ( @xmath0 ) term has been transferred to the charge carrier - spin interaction , which dominates the essential physics .    in the framework of the charge - spin separation , the basic low - energy excitations are charge carriers and spins .",
    "it has been shown that the charge dynamics is mainly governed by the scattering from the charge carriers due to the spin fluctuation@xcite , while the spin fluctuations couple only to the spin and therefore no composition law is required in discussing the spin dynamics@xcite , but the effect of charge carriers is still considered through the charge carrier s order parameter @xmath43 entering the spin propagator . in this case , the spin dynamics of the doped square antiferromagnet has been discussed@xcite by considering the spin fluctuation around the mean - field solution , where the spin part is treated by the loop expansion to the second order .",
    "following their discussions , we can obtain the dynamical spin structure for the electron doped cobaltates as @xmath44{\\rm im}d(k,\\omega),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where the full spin green s function , @xmath45 , with the mean - field ( mf ) spin green s functions @xmath46 , and the second - order spin self - energies from the charge carrier pair bubble , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of the nearest neighbor sites , @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52/3 $ ] , the spin correlation function @xmath53 , @xmath54-n_{b } ( \\omega_{k+p})[n_{f}(\\xi_{p'})-n_{f}(\\xi_{p+p'})]$ ] , @xmath55+[1+n_{b } ( \\omega_{k+p})][n_{f}(\\xi_{p'})-n_{f}(\\xi_{p+p'})]$ ] , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the boson and fermion distribution functions , respectively . the mf charge carrier and spin spectra are given by @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively , with @xmath60 , @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 $ ] , and the spin correlation function @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . in order not to violate the sum rule of the correlation function @xmath66 in the case without af long - range order ,",
    "the important decoupling parameter @xmath67 has been introduced in the mf calculation@xcite , which can be regarded as a vertex correction .",
    "all the above mf order parameters , decoupling parameter @xmath67 , and chemical potential @xmath26 are determined by the self - consistent calculation@xcite .",
    "= 3.5 in    = 3.5 in    for understanding the dynamic spin response of the electron doped cobaltates , we have calculated the integrated dynamical spin structure factor , which can be expressed as @xmath68 the numerical results of the integrated dynamical spin structure factor at doping ( a ) @xmath69 and ( b ) @xmath70 with the temperature @xmath71 ( dashed - dotted line ) , @xmath72 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath73 ( solid line ) for the parameter t / j= -2.5 are plotted in fig .",
    "it is shown that the integrated dynamical spin structure factor decreases with increasing energies for @xmath74 , and almost constant for @xmath75 . which is similar to the case of doped cuprates@xcite and reflects the common features of the doped mott insulators .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of the integrated dynamical spin structure factor , which is essentially temperature independent at high energy in a wide temperature regime , presents a strong deviation at the low - energy range , so that the shape of the integrated dynamical spin structure factor does not follow a universal behavior , in contrast to the case of the doped cuprates ( seen the insert in fig .",
    "it has been discussed that the universal behavior of the integrated dynamical spin structure factor in the doped cuprates is due to the absence of the normal state gap in the electron density of states@xcite .",
    "however , in the doped cobaltates , the normal state gap opens@xcite , which is mainly induced by the frustrated spin . since in the charge - spin separation framework the spin dynamics is dominated by the scattering of spins , which are strongly renormalized because of the strong interactions with fluctuations of surrounding charge carrier excitations . the frustrated spin moves in the background of the charge carriers , and the cloud of distorted charge carriers background",
    "is to follow the frustrated spins , which leads to the anomalous spin dynamics in the doped cobaltates . in other words ,",
    "the origin of the absence of the particularly universal behavior of the integrated dynamical spin structure factor in the doped cobaltates at low energy originates from the normal - state gap due to the magnetic frustration . in order to show this normal state gap clearly , we calculate the @xmath76 at higher temperature as shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the parameters are the same with the fig . 1 except for the temperature @xmath77 ( dashed - dotted line ) , @xmath78 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath79 ( solid line ) . in fig .",
    "2 , the temperature dependent integrated dynamical spin structure factor nearly degenerates and does nt show a deviation at low energy seen in fig .",
    "this universal behavior of the integrated dynamical spin structure factor exists for the whole temperature range is similar to the case of doped cuprates ( seen the insert in fig .",
    "1b)@xcite . from fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 , we estimate the normal state gap opens at temperature @xmath80 .",
    "according to our estimation @xmath81@xcite , we get the @xmath82 , very close to the experiments@xcite .",
    "now we turn our attention to discuss the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath2 .",
    "theoretically , the spin contributions to the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath2 divided by @xmath3 may be written using the imaginary part of the co dynamical electron spin - susceptibility @xmath83 as @xmath84 where @xmath85^{-1}s(k,\\omega)$ ] , @xmath86 is the @xmath86 factor , @xmath87 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the hyperfine coupling between the electron spin and the nuclear spin having gyromagnetic ratio @xmath90@xcite and is to be approximated to a constant in our calculation .",
    "= 3.5 in    the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath2 divided by @xmath3 in eq.(7 ) has been evaluated numerically and the results for t / j= -2.5 at the doping x=0.30 ( solid line ) , x=0.33 ( dashed - dotted line ) , and x=0.40 ( dotted line ) in comparison with the corresponding experiments ( inset ) are plotted in fig .",
    "it is shown that at low doping x=0.30 ( solid line ) and x=0.33 ( dashed - dotted line ) , the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath91 reduces with decreasing temperature in the temperature region @xmath92 , which is self - consistent with the integrated dynamical spin susceptibility shown in fig . 1 and fig . 2 , and is the result of the opening of normal state gap .",
    "however , in the low temperature region @xmath93 , the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath91 follows a curie - weiss - like behavior due to the existence of strong af fluctions . however , at the doping x=0.40 ( dotted line ) , although the normal state gap still exits at high temperature , curie - weiss - like behavior at low temperature disappears , indicating that af - fluctuations have become weak with the increasing doping .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the recent experiments@xcite . at the high doping @xmath94 ,",
    "the neutron scattering studies and time - of - flight experiments on na@xmath12coo@xmath7 and na@xmath13coo@xmath7@xcite , respectively , have observed the ferromagnetic correlation in the 2d coo@xmath7 plane .",
    "therefore , the magnetic fluctuation in the 2d coo@xmath7 plane has been affected by the electron doping , @xmath95 , the magnetic fluctuation is doping dependent .",
    "the later ab - inito band structure calculations for na@xmath5coo@xmath7 have given a certain critical value @xmath96 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility in the coo@xmath7 plane shows a tendency towards the af state below @xmath15 and ferromagnetic state above @xmath15@xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the dynamical spin response in the electron doped cobaltates within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "we have shown that due to the presence of normal state gap , the particularly universal behaviors of integrated dynamical spin structure factor seen in the doped cuprates at the low energy , are absent in the doped mott insulators on a triangular lattice .",
    "we have also shown that the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath2 divided by @xmath3 reduces with decreasing temperature in the temperature region above 0.2@xmath1@xmath450k , then follows a curie - weiss - like behavior at the temperature less than 50k originating from the strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations , in qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "our results also indicate that the electron doping plays a important role in altering the magnetic properties of the coo@xmath7 plane .",
