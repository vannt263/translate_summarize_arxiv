    "a notable property of the cyanopolyynes is the relatively high intensity rotational transition lines seen towards astronomical sources .",
    "the strong line intensity is due to the simplicity of the radio spectra of these linear carbon chains with large dipole moments .",
    "the cyanopolyynes are valuable guides for the study of all large molecule chemistry in the is medium . the chemical relationships and distribution in tmc-1 of molecules @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath5  have been studied by many authors , including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . the relative abundance of deuterated and @xmath0 isotopomers of molecules in the is medium is an important test for models of is chemistry @xcite .    in ",

    "the gbt ku - band receiver has two feeds , separated by an angular offset of 330  in cross - elevation direction on the sky .",
    "before each spectral line observing session , we first performed peak and focus observations on bright continuum radio source 3c123 . unless the weather was very poor , the first peak and focus observations were almost always successful .",
    "typical pointing offsets were under @xmath12 in either axis . in the case of unusually large offsets ( @xmath13 ) , found only during poor weather , the peak observations were repeated .",
    "all spectral line observations were performed using the astrid nod procedure .",
    "the nod procedure allows simultaneous `` signal '' and `` reference '' observations using both beams of the ku - band receiver .",
    "a nod observation consists of two 4-minute scans , one with the first beam of the dual beam receiver pointing towards the target location , followed by a second scan with the second beam pointed towards the target location .",

    "the gbt spectrometer is configured to simultaneously collect spectra at the same frequencies in both beams . for these observations ,",
    "the spectrometer continuously controlled injection of a 2 - 3 k noise diode signal into both beams via rf inputs of both polarizations .",

    "the raw data were calibrated to an antenna temperature scale by the @xmath23 technique , where @xmath24 is the measured intensity ( raw counts ) as a function of frequency , @xmath25 , when observing the source location , and @xmath26 is the measured intensity ( raw counts ) when observing one of the two reference locations .",

    "the system temperature for each channel was defined as average of the noise diode on and noise diode off spectra divided by the difference of noise diode on and noise diode off spectra , then multiplied by the effective temperature of the calibration noise diode value measured in the laboratory . for the purposes of intensity calibration ,",

    "the high effectiveness of median filtering in removing spectral lines is shown for the median of the signal spectrum in figure 2",
    ".    the median width must be narrow enough to preserve significant variations in the if gain as a function of frequency , but must be wide enough to reduce the noise in the reference spectrum and to reject any weak narrow lines at the reference position .",
    "calibration using the median spectrum produces a higher signal to noise ratio spectrum than calibration without smoothing the reference spectrum .",
    "the @xmath22 scaled data were further calibrated to brightness temperature ( corrected for atmospheric opacity ) in order to compare these results with previous observations and computing the physical properties of tmc-1 .",
    "the @xmath30 calibration was performed assuming tmc-1 is more extended than the gbt primary beam in the frequency range 11.6 to 14.5 ghz .",

    "a spectral baseline is computed for each polarization separately .",
    "the spectral baseline is the median of the observed spectrum computed over a 0.5 mhz width centered on each channel of the spectrum .",
    "a median baseline is commonly used for gbt spectral line observations , which cover a relatively wide bandwidth @xcite .",
    "the near identical intensity of the left and right circular polarization shows the good agreement of the two independent calibrations of the intensity of the two polarizations .",
    "the @xmath4 @xmath38 line was chosen as the calibration example to illustrate the importance of using a wide median filter window for baseline subtraction , to preserve the line intensity in the case of a number of closely spaced transistions .",
    "the @xmath4 hyperfine transitions are sufficiently close that a narrower median filter width in the baseline calculation would reduce line intensity .",

    "the gbt system is designed to accurately track the reference frame for the center frequency of the first of the four bands .",
    "all other up and down frequency conversions are done in topocentric frame .",
    "the consequence of this design is that the observations for the first frequency band may be averaged for long durations , without frequency smearing of the molecular lines . for the remaining three frequency bands",
    ", care must be taken to properly align the spectra before averaging over several epochs .",
    "we have written a number of _ interactive display language _ ( idl ) scripts to properly account for the shift in center frequency of the spectral bands over time .",

    "a goal of the present work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of these procedures .",
    "our process of averaging spectra with different channel bandwidths and center frequencies is similar to the standard process for convolving irregularly sampled continuum intensity values onto an image grid @xcite .",
    "the process of combining the spectra , @xmath39 , from each epoch of observation has three major components . before averaging ,",
    "each of the @xmath39 spectra are @xmath30 calibrated .",
    "the first step in computing an average spectrum from a set of spectra from each epoch , @xmath39 , with different center frequencies and channel separation is definition of the output spectral sum , @xmath40 , and the convolving function @xmath41 . for spectral",

    "the offset between the input frequency channel of a single observation and the frequency of a channel of the average spectra is @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45}\\ ] ]    this convolving function definition has three desired properties .",
    "the first is at zero frequency offset the convolving function is unity , i.e. @xmath46 . the second property is if the offset is half the channel width , then the two adjacent channels are averaged , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "the third property is if the input channels have a large frequency offset , then these channels make little contribution to the average , i.e. @xmath48 . for our application , the weighting function kernel width is @xmath295 channels .    the spectra from each epoch is gridded into the output spectrum in the same manner . for each channel in the output spectrum ( frequency @xmath25 ) ,",
    "the closest channels in the input spectrum were found ( frequency @xmath49 ) .",
    "next over the convolution function kernel size , the frequency offset between the input spectrum and the output channel was computed .",
    "the convolution function was computed and multiplied by a constant spectral weight for each epoch of observation .",
    "the spectrum weight is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the integration time and @xmath28 is the system temperature .",
    "this weighting yields the optimum signal to noise ratio in the output spectrum .",
    "the input spectrum was multiplied by the weighted convolution kernel and summed into the output spectrum .",
    "the weighted convolution kernel is summed into the convolution weight spectrum .",
    "@xmath52    @xmath53    the output spectrum is produced from the ratio of the convolved weighted input values and the summed convolution function . @xmath54",
    "both weak and strong lines may be averaged using this technique .",
    "figure 6 shows the weighted average of @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath55 transitions , along with the individual transitions offset by 0.5 k. table 2 shows the measured intensities for the weighted average of the lines .    for molecules with simple structure , such as the cyanopolyynes , the line strength of closely spaced j rotational transitions changes smoothly and predictably .",
    "the line intensities are weak for larger interstellar molecules , and several days of observations are required to detect these transitions . for molecules with several closely spaced , similar strength , rotation transitions , the total observing time to required to obtain a desired signal to noise ratio is reduced linearly with the number of transitions observed . for weak molecular line detections ,",
    "we have demonstrated ( as expected ) that the signal to noise ratio of the detection is doubled by averaging observations of four transitions .",
    "larger linear molecules have many closely spaced , similar strength transitions , so no weighting for expected line strength is required .",

    "tmc-1 covers a smaller fraction of the 140 ft telescope beam area . as figure 1 shows , tmc-1 is a roughly linear structure at the 140 ft angular resolution , so we expect to measure a greater intensity with the gbt , roughly in relationship to the ratio of the gbt and 140 ft telescope diameters .",
