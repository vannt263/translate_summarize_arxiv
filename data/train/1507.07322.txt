    "the weak measurement , as a generalized von neumann quantum measurement theory , was proposed by aharonov , albert , and vaidman@xcite . in weak measurement ,",
    "the coupling between pointer and measured systems is sufficiently weak , but its induced weak value of the observable on the measured system can be beyond the usual range of the eigenvalues of that observable@xcite .",
    "this feature of weak value is usually referred to as an amplification effect for weak signals rather than a conventional quantum measurement that collapses a coherent superposition of quantum states@xcite .",
    "after first optical implementation of weak value@xcite , it has been applied in different fields to observe very tiny effects , such as beam deflection @xcite , frequency shifts @xcite , phase shifts @xcite , angular shifts @xcite , velocity shifts @xcite , and even temperature shift @xcite .",
    "weak value has a nature of being a complex number , which lead the weak measurements to provide an ideal method to examine some fundamentals of quantum physics .",
    "quantum paradoxes ( hardy s paradox @xcite and the three - box paradox @xcite ) , quantum correlation and quantum dynamics @xcite , quantum state tomography @xcite , violation of the generalized leggett - garg inequalities @xcite and violation of the initial heisenberg measurement - disturbance relationship @xcite are just few examples . in these typical examples , the small effects have been amplified due to the benefit of weak values .",
    "this amplifying effect occurs when the preselection and postselection states of the measured system are almost orthogonal .",
    "the successful postselection probability tends to decrease in order to have successful amplification effect . for more details about weak measurement and weak value",
    ", one can consult these reviews @xcite .",
    "so far , most of weak measurement studies focus on using the zero - mean gaussian state as an initial pointer state .",
    "however , recent studies @xcite have shown that zero - mean gaussian pointer state can not improve the snr when considering postselection probability .",
    "needless to say gaussian beam is classical and one may naturally ask how about using non - classical pointer states , and what kind of advantages they have ?",
    "this issue has been recently addressed @xcite , where coherent and coherent squeezed states were utilized as pointers .",
    "they showed that the postselected weak measurement improved the snr compared to the non - postselected process if the pointer state , is non - classical rather than classical .",
    "the focus of the calculation was based on the assumption that the coupling between measuring device and measured system is too weak , and hence it was enough to consider the time evolution operator up to its first order .",
    "furthermore , there have been recent studies giving full order effects of the unitary evolution due to the von neumann interaction , but for classical and semi - classical states@xcite .    in this paper , we address a remaining point of interest constructing a general formula for weak measurement beyond the first order , and utilizing the non - classical states .",
    "we investigate the advantages of non - classical pointer states over classical ( semi - classical ) pointer state , within weak values , by considering postselection probability . in order to do so , we use coherent , squeezed vacuum , and schringer cat states as pointer states for system observable @xmath0 with property @xmath1 .",
    "we start by presenting an analytical general expressions of the shifted values of position and momentum operators for the above mentioned pointer states with arbitrary measurement strengths . in addition , we present the ratio of snr between postselected and non - postselected weak measurement , and also look at quantum fisher information .",
    "our key results in this paper are ( i ) our general expressions of shifted values reduce to the nakamuras@xcite main result if we take the zero - mean gaussian beam as initial pointer state .",
    "( ii ) as shown in ref.@xcite , improving the snr using postselected weak measurement , one needs the non - classical pointer states which is better than classical or semi - classical states .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give the setup for our system . in section iii , we start by giving general expressions for the expectation values of position and momentum operators . after that we discuss the ratio of snr between postselected and non - postselected weak measurements of coherent , squeezed vacuum , and schringer cat states . in section iv",
    ", we give the fisher information for those given states in the light of postselection probability .",
    "we give conclusion to our paper in section v. throughout this paper , we use the unit @xmath3 .",
    "for the weak measurement , the coupling interaction between system and measuring device is given by the standard von neumann hamiltonian@xcite    @xmath4    here , @xmath5 is a coupling constant and @xmath6 is the conjugate momentum operator , while the position operator is @xmath7 where @xmath8=i\\hat{i}$ ] .",
    "we have taken , for simplicity , the interaction to be impulsive at time @xmath9 .",
    "for this kind of impulsive interaction the time evolution operator becomes as @xmath10 .",
    "the weak measurement is characterized by the preselection and postselection of the system state .",
    "if we prepare the initial state @xmath11 of the system and the pointer state , and after some interaction time @xmath12 , we then postselect a system state @xmath13 and obtain the information about a physical quantity @xmath0 from the pointer wave function by the following weak value : @xmath14 where the subscript @xmath15 denotes the weak value . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wv ] ) , we know that when the preselected state @xmath11 and the postselected state @xmath13 are almost orthogonal , the absolute value of the weak value can be arbitrarily large .",
    "this feature leads to weak value amplification .",
    "we express position operator @xmath16 and momentum operator @xmath17 in terms of the annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath18(@xmath19 ) in fock space representation as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the width of the fundamental gaussian beam .",
    "these annihilation ( creation ) operators obey the commutation relation @xmath22=\\hat{i}$ ] . by substituting eq.([eq : anniy ] ) into unitary evolution operator @xmath10 , bearing in mind that operator @xmath0 satisfies the property @xmath1 , we get : @xmath23 where parameter @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a displacement operator with complex number @xmath27 defined by @xmath28 note that @xmath24 characterizes the measurement strength .",
