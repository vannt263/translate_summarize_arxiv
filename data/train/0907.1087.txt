    "an important goal for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution is to quantify the state of the molecular gas ( mass , temperature , and density ) available to form stars in young galaxies .",
    "depite many years of study at submm - to - cm wavelengths , very few observational probes of the molecular gas in high - redshift starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have emerged .",
    "most efforts have focused on observations of redshifted co line emission , demonstrated to be an effective tracer of the total molecular gas reservoir available to form stars in nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "searches at high - redshift have successfully detected co line emission in more than 60 galaxies ( e.g. solomon & vanden  bout  2005 ) , where most have been selected for their luminosity at far - infrared wavelengths , indicating the presence of heavy elements .",
    "high dipole moment molecules such as hcn and hco@xmath8 have been detected in the most luminous objects within this co - selected sample ( solomon et al .",
    "2003 ; vanden  bout et al .  2004 ; wagg et al .  2005 ; riechers et al .",
    "these high - density gas tracers have proven very difficult to detect in high - redshift objects , as they are typically an order of magnitude fainter than the corresponding co line emission .",
    "megamaser emission from the oh and h@xmath1o molecules may serve as a powerful alternative means of studying the dense gas in high - redshift objects ( see lo 2005 for a review ) . generally associated with star - formation or agn activity , strong oh or h@xmath1o megamaser emission could be detected at frequencies , @xmath9  10  ghz using current facilities .",
    "the luminosity in the oh maser line has been demonstrated to correlate strongly with fir luminosity ( darling & giovanelli 2002 ) , while a weak correlation may also exist between the fir luminosity and that in the 22  ghz water megamaser line ( castangia et al .",
    "surveys for both molecular species in strongly lensed quasars and submm galaxies ( hereafter smgs ) have been conducted ( wilner et al .",
    "1999 ; ivison 2006 ; castangia et al .",
    "2008 ; edmonds et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the first detection of h@xmath1o megamaser emission at a cosmologically significant distance was in a type - ii qso at @xmath10 by barvainis & antonucci ( 2004 ) .",
    "more recently , impellizzeri et al .  ( 2008 ) have detected h@xmath1o megamaser emission in the lensed quasar , mg  j0414 + 0534 at @xmath11 .",
    "the discovery of such megamaser emission in a quasar existing when the universe was about 20% of its present age , opens up the possibility that megamaser ( or kilomaser ) emission may also be detectable in equally luminous , star - forming galaxies at these early times .",
    "masers are observed towards star - forming regions in the milky way , and indeed have been detected in a few nearby starburst galaxies ( e.g. haschick & baan 1985 ; henkel , wouterloot & bally 1986 ; hagiwara , diamond & miyoshi 2002 , 2003 ; nakai , sato & yamauchi 2002 ) .",
    "extragalactic h@xmath1o megamasers with isotropic luminosities , @xmath1210  l@xmath3 , are confined to the nuclei of galaxies , where the physical conditions needed to reach population inversion , namely temperatures above 300  k and densities greater than 10@xmath13  @xmath14 , are more likely to be present .    among the most luminous class of high - redshift starburst galaxies",
    "are the submm galaxies ( smgs ) , discovered in blank - field submm / mm - wavelength bolometer surveys with single - dish telescopes ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al.1998 ; bertoldi et al .",

    "optical spectroscopic surveys have published redshifts for less than 100 smgs ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "these surveys have been hindered by the coarse angular resolution of submm / mm telescopes , so that deep radio interferometry has been needed to identify the correct multi - wavelength counterparts , and also by the faintness of the optical / infrared counterparts ( e.g. wang et al .",
    "an alternative method has been to use broad bandwidth mm - to - cm wavelength receivers in searching for redshifted co line emission ( wagg et al .  2007 ;",
    "daddi et al .  2009a , b ) .",
    "these searches have so far been moderately successful in obtaining redshifts for @xmath22 smgs .",
    "lower frequency searches for redshifted megamaser and gigamaser emission may prove to be a viable alternative to searches for molecular co line emission in smgs ( townsend et al .  2001 ; ivison et al .",
    "2006 ; edmonds et al .  2009 ) , with telescopes like the expanded very large array ( evla ) .",
    "such observations could also provide an effective means of probing the dense gas in these objects , since previous searches for hcn emission in smgs have not been successful ( carilli et al .",

    "the two smgs in our sample were discovered in submm surveys of low redshift galaxy clusters , where gravitational lensing has been used to constrain the faint end of the submm / mm source counts ( @xmath272  mjy ; e.g. smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; knudsen et al .",
    "both sources have also been previously detected in co line emission , so that the emission redshift of the molecular gas region is known with sufficient accuracy to conduct further searches for redshifted h@xmath1o megamaser emission within the narrow spectral bandwidth afforded by the current vla correlator .",

    "2000 ) , and subsequently detected in line emission by frayer et al .",
    "the lensing amplification factor of this source has been the subject of some debate , and may be as high as @xmath2925 ( downes & solomon 2003 ; motohara 2005 ; smail et al .  2005 ; smith et al .",
    "2005 ) , however in this analysis we adopt a lower factor of 3.5 ( smail et al .",
    "2005 ) so as to be conservative in our derived luminosity limits in the case of a non - detection .",
    "the optical spectral characteristics of this smg are consistent with that of a starburst galaxy ( frayer et al .",
    "1999 ) , while the mid - ir spectrum is also consistent with no agn being present in this smg ( rigby et al .",
    "our second target ,  is a @xmath30 smg lensed into three components by the a2218 cluster ( kneib et al .",
    "2004 ) , with the brightest component lensed by a factor of @xmath2922 .",

    "both orthogonal polarizations were recorded .",
    "five minutes were spent in each of the ` on ' and ` off ' positions during a single scan .",

    "( 2009 ) , we first correct the spectrum extracted at each of the three components of for its corresponding lensing factor ( kneib et al .  2005 ) , before adding these together with the appropriate weighting to create the average spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the rms of this average spectrum is 11.6@xmath15jy per 97.7  khz channel , which is a factor of @xmath34 lower than that obtained by edmonds et al .",

    "we should then expect an h@xmath1o megamaser luminosity , @xmath40  l@xmath3 , which is also consistent with our observed limits . if we assume the weak correlation between the h@xmath1o megamaser luminosity and fir luminosity measured for fir bright galaxies by castangia et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we would expect megamaser line luminosities of , 3800 and 16800  l@xmath3 for and smm  j14011 + 0252 , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity of our constraints on h@xmath1o megamaser emission in these two star - forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) would suggest that they do not contain strong megamasers , such as that observed in mg  j0414 + 0534 at @xmath41 .",
    "although our sample size is small , these non - detections in strongly lensed , metal and gas - rich starburst galaxies would imply that strong h@xmath1o megamaser emission may not be common among such objects . as pointed out by edmonds et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , it is likely that the physical conditions of the interstellar gas in these predominantly star - forming smgs is not sufficiently warm and dense to excite megamaser line emission , which is more readily excited in the x - ray irradiated environments close to a central agn ( neufeld et al .  1994 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the density and temperature of the gas are large , but the gas is not sufficiently coherent in velocity with the maser source to produce strong amplification .",
    "weiss et al .",
    "( 2005 ) observe multiple transitions of co line emission in smm  j16359 + 6612 , which reveal a double - peaked co line profile , consistent with either a circumnuclear toroid of rotating molecular gas , or molecular gas associated with separate components of an ongoing merger .",
    "their excitation analysis finds the gas to be cool , with temperatures most likely below @xmath2980  k , while the large star - formation rate ( @xmath29500  m@xmath3  yr@xmath6 ) inferred by kneib et al .",
    "( 2004 ) should result in a high gas excitation if the co line emission were due to a single , massive component .",
    "this low excitation gas spread over multiple components is also consistent with our non - detection of an h@xmath1o megamaser in smm  j16359 + 6612 .    although our luminosity limits are consistent with what one would expect from a simple extrapolation of the @xmath42 relation in galactic star - forming regions , these limits do not rule out the presence of h@xmath1o `` kilomasers '' ( @xmath43  l@xmath3 ) , which are typically found both within , and exterior to the nuclei of nearby star - forming galaxies ( e.g. hagiwara et al . 2001 , 2003 ; henkel et al .",
    "2004 ) . detecting such emission in a member of the , @xmath445  mjy , smg population would require hundreds of hours of observing time using the full evla , or arecibo .",
    "nearby ulitraluminous infrared galaxies , which are the nearest analogues to the high - redshift smgs , generally do not exhibit strong water megamaser emission .",
    "the exceptions to this are ngc6240 and ugc5101 ( hagiwara et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) , which are both believed to contain agn .",
    "such an association of strong h@xmath1o megamaser emission with nearby agn , rather than starburst ulirgs , is consistent with our non - detections in and smm  j14011 + 0252 .",
    "this would also support the original claim by edmonds et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that h@xmath1o megamasers will not be an effective means of measuring redshifts for starburst smgs in future evla surveys .",
    "although we do not detect megamaser emission in the two starburst galaxies observed , the detection of an h@xmath1o megamaser in mg  j0414 + 0534 suggests that such emission may also be present in smgs hosting an agn .",
    "the results of deep x - ray imaging of smgs shows that 2850% may harbour an agn ( alexander et al .",
    "2005 ) , while the median mid - infrared spectrum of a sample of 24 smgs ( menndez - delmestre et al .",
    "2009 ) , suggests that less than one third of the fir luminosity is likely powered by such agn ( pope et al .",
    "we can use these results to make simple predictions for future c - band surveys with the evla .    with the already existing , expanded frequency coverage of the evla c - band receivers , it is possible to search for water megamaser emission in @xmath45 smgs .",
    "the forthcoming availability of the widar correlator will also make it possible to obtain spectroscopy over the entire 48  ghz window , so that searches for redshifted megamaser emission could be conducted over the redshift range , @xmath46 , within a field of view of 44  sq .",

    "assuming @xmath20  k and @xmath48 for this sub - sample of the population , then their expected fir luminosities would be , @xmath49  l@xmath3 .",
    "roughly 73% of the bright , radio - detected smg population ( chapman et al .  2005 ) , would have a redshift that places the 22.23508  ghz water maser line in the frequency interval covered by the evla c - band . while it may be that the 15 - 20% of bright smgs with no 1.4  ghz radio counterpart are at redshifts , @xmath50 ( e.g. ivison et al .  2005 ; wagg et al .  2009 ) , we will assume here that all of these are at redshifts , @xmath51 ( although see coppin et al .  2009 ) .",
    "if we make the assumption that 30% of the smgs in this redshft range have agn , and that 30% of their fir luminosity is powered by this agn , then we would expect one smg in a single c - band pointing to have agn with fir luminosities , @xmath52  l@xmath3 . if we assume the ratio between @xmath53 and l@xmath54 measured in mg  j0414 + 0534 ( impellizzeri et al .",
    "2008 ) , and also that these smgs do indeed host a water megamaser where the accretion disk is being viewed edge - on , then they could exhibit isotropic h@xmath1o line luminosities , @xmath55  l@xmath3 . for the faintest ,",
    "unlensed sources at @xmath56 , a maximum of 30 evla hours would be needed to detect the megamaser emission .",
