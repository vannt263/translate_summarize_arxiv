    "the spontaneous appearance of cooperative motions called dynamic heterogeneity ( dh ) when liquids are supercooled @xcite has been extensively studied during the last decade , as scientists were searching for a cooperative mechanism at the origin of the glass - transition . despite large efforts in that direction of research however , the origin of the dynamic heterogeneity and the effect of these cooperative motions on the liquid dynamics still remain elusive .",
    "it is widely thought that dhs appear due to the presence of some defects inside the low temperature liquid , that could be structural ( a local packing fluctuation ) or purely dynamical ( excitations ) .",
    "the resulting excitations ( arising directly or from structural defects ) then grow due to facilitation@xcite processes , eventually disappearing at large timescales due to thermal diffusion . in 2004 ,",
    "asaph widmer - cooper and coworkers@xcite showed that dhs appear preferentially in some regions of the liquid , a result that strongly suggests a connection between the local structure and the dhs . in 2007 ,",
    "laura kaufman s group @xcite studied the effect of probes larger than the medium molecules on the dynamics of supercooled liquids .",
    "they found that the dynamics slows down or accelerates depending on the probe s roughness , while the dhs increase in both cases , and concluded that probes can promote dynamic heterogeneities . in 2009",
    ", we found that dynamical defects created by probes isomerizing inside the medium can strongly promote dhs@xcite while accelerating the dynamics , results that were confirmed by experiments and simulations@xcite . following these works , results on colloids@xcite , and theoretical findings@xcite , in order to test the hypothesis of a packing fluctuation origin of the dhs",
    ", we investigate in this paper the effect of small structural defects on the dynamics of a model supercooled liquid and on the strength of dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "we focus our work on probes of sizes comparable with the size of the medium s molecules in order to model small cages fluctuations .",
    "we also focus on the possibility for some probes to destroy the dynamic heterogeneities . in agreement with the results of kaufman",
    "s group we find that large probes promote the dhs in our liquid , however we also find that small probes can destroy the heterogeneities .",
    "in this work we use molecular dynamics simulations@xcite ( md ) to simulate the dynamics of a fragile@xcite supercooled liquid when small or large probe molecules are diluted inside .",
    "this simulation method permits to gain information on the motion of each molecule of the medium provided that the interatomic potentials are known with enough accuracy , and is thus an invaluable tool to unravel condensed matter physics phenomena@xcite at the microscopic level .",
    "we model the molecules@xcite of the medium as constituted of two atoms ( @xmath0 ) that we rigidly bond fixing the interatomic distance to @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "each atom of our linear molecule has a mass @xmath3 g/@xmath4 where @xmath4 is the avogadro number .",
    "atoms of the set of linear molecules constituting our liquid interact with the following lennard - jones potentials : @xmath5    with the parameters : @xmath6 kj / mol , @xmath7 kj / mol , @xmath8  and @xmath9@xmath2 .",
    "our mean molecule is thus @xmath10@xmath2 long and @xmath11@xmath2 wide . with these parameters",
    "the liquid does not crystallize when supercooled even during long simulation runs@xcite .",
    "this model has been described and studied in detail previously@xcite and was found to display the typical behaviors of fragile supercooled liquids .",
    "as they are modeled with lennard - jones atoms , the potentials are quite versatile . due to that property , a shift in the parameters",
    "@xmath12 will shift all the temperatures by the same amount , including the glass - transition temperature and the melting temperature of the material .",
    "we add to that medium @xmath13 smaller or larger molecules ( the probes ) intended to create small localized perturbations in the medium structure .",
    "we have @xmath14 probe molecules diluted within @xmath15 medium molecules inside the simulation box .",
    "this number of molecules lead to a simulation box size of @xmath16 , that insures the disappearance of size effects@xcite in our liquid at the temperature of study .",
    "the probes are similar diatomic molecules defined by the parameters : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21@xmath2 , @xmath22 , @xmath23   and @xmath24 .",
    "the density is set constant in our calculations at @xmath25 .",
    "when rescaled , or in dimensionless units , that density value is larger than the density of the original model@xcite , and thus leads to a more viscous medium .",
    "we use the gear algorithm with the quaternion method@xcite to solve the equations of motions with a time step @xmath26 @xmath27 above @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath27 below that temperature .",
    "the temperature is controlled using a berendsen thermostat@xcite . to prevent aging processes we equilibrate the supercooled liquid during @xmath30 ns , a time much larger than the @xmath31 relaxation time at the lower temperature studied , before recording the simulation results .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we expect slower motions around the large inclusions and more rapid motions around the small inclusions .",
    "this modification of the molecular motions around the defects will result in a local heterogeneity of the mobilities , that may induce or destroy dynamic heterogeneities if facilitation mechanisms are present in the system .",
    "we thus expect a modification of the liquid s dynamic heterogeneity around the inclusions .",

    "the local structure is however modified around the probe as shown in figure 1a and 1b .",
    "figure 1 suggests that the cage is smaller around the large probes and slightly larger around the small probe , as the first peak of the radial distribution function is shifted to a smaller distance for large probes than for medium molecules .",

    "+ _    because the cages around the large probes are smaller than the medium s cages , and these probes are larger than the medium s molecules , we expect a decrease of the free volume around large probes .",
    "the decrease of the free volume around large probes then results in a decrease of the diffusion around these probes .",
    "similarly we expect an increase in the free volume around small probes resulting in an acceleration of the diffusive motions .    to verify that picture we evaluate the free volume @xmath34 around the probe from the height of the plateau of the mean square displacement of the probe ( see the inset of figure 3 ) .",

    "the free volume for small probes is thus larger than for the mean medium molecules , leading to the increase of the diffusion for small probes that we observe in the inset of figure 3 . as a result",
    "the inclusion of small or large molecules respectively increase or decrease the mean square displacements around the perturbation .",
    "the defects thus slow down or accelerate the dynamics around them for large or small inclusions respectively .",
