    "the fokas - lenells equation ( fl)@xcite @xmath0 is one of the important models from both mathematical and physical considerations . in eq.([fl ] ) , @xmath1 represents complex field envelope and asterisk denotes complex conjugation , and subscript @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) .",
    "the fl equation @xcite is related to the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation in the same way that the camassa - holm equation is associated with the kdv equation . in optics , considering suitable higher order linear and nonlinear optical effects",
    ", the fl equation has been derived as a model to describe femtosecond pulse propagation through single mode optical silica fiber and several interesting solutions have been constrcuted @xcite .    here , considering the physical significance of the fl equation and inspired by the importance of the recent interesting developments in the analysis of rogue waves of the nls and the dnls equations",
    ", we shall construct rogue wave solutions of the fl equation , by using the darboux transformation ( dt)@xcite . our construction reveals that there exists a difference between the fl system and other integrable models , like the ablowitz - kaup - newell - segur ( akns ) @xcite system and the kaup - newell ( kn ) @xcite system .    before discussing the dt of the fl system ,",
    "let us briefly discuss the importance of rogue waves in mathematics and physics .",
    "rogue waves have recently been the subject of intensive investigations in oceanography@xcite , where they occur due to modulation instability @xcite , either through random initial condition @xcite or via other processes @xcite .",
    "the first order rogue wave usually takes the form of a single peak hump with two caves in a plane with a nonzero boundary .",
    "one of the possible generating mechanisms for rogue waves is through the creation of breathers@xcite which can be formed due to modulation instability .",
    "then , larger rogue waves can emerge when two or more breathers collide with each other @xcite .",
    "rogue waves have also been observed in space plasmas@xcite , as well as in optics when propagating high power optical radiation through photonic crystal fibers @xcite . considering higher order effects in the propagation of femtosecond pulses ,",
    "rogue waves have been reported in the hirota equation and the nls - mb system@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 , presents a simple approach to dt for the fl system , the determinant representation of the 1-fold dt , and formulae of @xmath4}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] expressed in terms of eigenfunctions of the associated spectral problem .",
    "the reduction of dt to the fl equation is also discussed by choosing appropriate pairs of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "section 3 presents the construction of rogue wave solutions by using a taylor series expansion about the breather solution generated by dt from a periodic seed solution with constant amplitude .",
    "finally , in section 4 we conclude our results .",
    "let us start from the non - trivial flow of the fl ( fokas - lenells ) system@xcite in the following modified form , @xmath6 @xmath7 which are exactly reduced to the fl eq.([fl ] ) for @xmath8 while the choice @xmath9 would lead to eq.([fl ] ) with change in sign of the nonlinear term .",
    "the lax pairs corresponding to coupled fl eq.([sy1 ] ) and ( [ sy2 ] ) can be given by the fl spectral problem of the form @xcite",

    "it is easy to check @xmath4}=(r^{[1]})^*$ ] with the help of following choice of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions : @xmath45 thus , under the above choice of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues , the resulting @xmath46 in eq.([onefolddt ] ) can be called as one - fold darboux transformation of the fl equation .",
    "further , taking one pair of eigenvalues @xmath47 and @xmath48 and their corresponding eigenfunctions , the final form of one - fold dt eq.([onefolddt ] ) reduces to a new solution of the form @xmath49}=q+\\dfrac{({\\lambda_{2}}^{2}-{\\lambda_{1}}^{2 } )   \\phi_{1}{\\varphi_{1}}^{\\ast}}{\\lambda_2\\lambda_1(-\\lambda_{2}\\varphi_{1 }   { \\varphi_{1}}^{\\ast}+\\lambda_{1}\\phi_{1}{\\phi_{1}}^{\\ast})},\\ ] ] notice that the denominator of @xmath4}$ ] has a nonzero imaginary part if @xmath50 is not zero , which clearly indicates that the new solution @xmath4}$ ] is a non - singular solution .",
    "using the results of dt constructed above , breather solutions of fl equation can be generated by assuming a periodic seed solution of eq.([q2j2 ] ) , then we can construct the rogue waves of the fl equation from a taylor series expansion of the breather solutions .    for this purpose , assuming @xmath51 and @xmath52 as two real constants , then @xmath53 is a periodic solution of the fl equation , which will be used as a seed solution of the dt . substituting the above form of @xmath1 into the spectral problem eq.([sys11 ] ) and eq.([sys22 ] ) , and using the method of separation of variables and the superposition principle , the eigenfunction @xmath54 associated with @xmath30",
    "are given explicitly .",
    "for simplicity , setting @xmath55 , taking @xmath56 back into eq.([q2j2 ] ) , then the final form of the breather solution is obtained in the form @xmath57}=\\lefteqn{(\\dfrac{-2\\alpha_{1}\\beta_{1}(w_1\\cosh(h_1)+w_2sinh(h_1)+w_3\\cos(h_2)+w_4sin(h_2))}{w_5\\cosh(h_1)+w_6sinh(h_1)+w_7\\cos(h_2)+w_8sin(h_2)}{}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & { } \\mbox{\\hspace{0.5cm}}-\\dfrac{\\sqrt{a+2{\\alpha_1}^{2}-2{\\beta_1}^{2}}}{a})\\exp(i(ax+(a+2-\\dfrac{2({\\beta_{1}}^{2}-{\\alpha_{1}}^{2})t}{a^2}))),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 from eq.([q2j3 ] ) , we can easily get the ma breathers@xcite(time periodic breather solution ) and the akhmediev breathers @xcite ( space periodic breather solution ) solution . in general , the solution in eq.([q2j3 ] ) evolves periodically along the straight line with a certain angle between @xmath2 and @xmath3 axis",

    "thus , in this paper , considering fl system of equation which describes nonlinear pulse propagation through single mode optical fiber , the determinant representation of the one - fold dt for the fl system is given eqs.([onefolddt ] ) and ( [ stt ] ) . by choosing pair of eigenvalues in the form @xmath73 and assuming suitable seed solutions , the breather solution and rogue waves of the fl equation are derived in eq .",

    "our results provide an alternative possibility to observe rogue waves in optical system . from the one - fold dt , it is interesting to observe that the dt of the fl system exhibits the following novelty in comparison with other integrable models like the akns and the kn systems : the dt matrix of the fl system has three different terms depending on @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the dt as well as the rogue wave of the fl system present novel features , in comparison with the dt and rogue wave solutions of the standard integrable systems like the akns and the kn systems . the construction of higher order rogue wave of the fl equation by using the determinant representation of the dt will be published elsewhere .    *",
