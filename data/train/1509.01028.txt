    "it is generally accepted that agns are powered by accretion to a smbh and the broad emission lines seen in type i agn are produced as the result of photoionization of gas in the blr .",
    "however the structure and kinematics of the blr is a key problem in modern astrophysics .",
    "broad emission lines are emitted in the vicinity of smbh in agn , but this region is not resolved in observations .",
    "properties of the broad emission lines are used to estimate the mass of the central smbh . the traditional method for estimating the smbh mass is to use the virial theorem .",
    "it means that the mass of the smbh can be estimated as @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the mass of a black hole , @xmath2 is a virial parameter that defines the geometry , velocity field and orientation of blr , @xmath3 is the radius of blr and @xmath4 is the velocity dispersion that is measured as the full width of the emission line in the variable spectrum .",
    "the blr radius @xmath3 is usually given by the time delay between continuum and emission line variations .",
    "there are various approaches for determining the value of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite found that in quasars an isotropic blr fails to reproduce the observed line widths and shapes , and a disk model is preferred .",
    "a disk like geometry for the blr has been proposed by several authors @xcite .",
    "some authors suggested that the blr can not be completely flat ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it means that disk may have a finite half thickness @xmath5 , or a profile with @xmath5 increasing more than linearly with the disk radius .",
    "other models propose the existence of warped disks @xcite .    according to @xcite",
    "the hydrogen lines are emitted in a more flattened configuration in comparison to the highly ionized lines .",
    "@xmath6 lines originate at heights of 0.7 to 1.6 light days and at distances of 1.4 to 2.4 light days with height / distance ratios @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite found that the geometry of the blr is generally a thick disk viewed close to face on .",
    "@xcite have found that the inclination angle of blr is @xmath8 , and @xcite suggested that the inclination of the blr can be @xmath9 .",
    "the virial coefficient @xmath2 depends strongly on the blr geometry , velocity field and orientation .",
    "many authors used the value @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite found the mean value of the virial coefficient @xmath12 . @xcite",
    "have shown that for a disk inclined at an angle @xmath13 to the observer the virial coefficient value is    @xmath14    in this paper we adopt the disk like model for the blr of seyfert galaxies and the expression for @xmath2 given by ( [ eq02 ] ) .",
    "the value of the inclination angle can be determined from polarimetric observations using the standard chandrasekhar - sobolev theory @xcite of multiple scatterings of the radiation on free electrons and rayleigh scattering on gas molecules and small dust particles . according to these classical works , the polarization degree of scattered radiation depends strongly on the inclination angle .",
    "the scattered radiation has the maximum linear polarization @xmath15 when the line of sight is perpendicular to the normal to the semi - infinite atmosphere ( milne problem ) . @xcite and @xcite presented the solution of the so - called milne problem , i.e. multiple scattering of light in optically thick flattened atmospheres .",
    "the milne problem corresponds to the propagation and scattering of light in optically thick disk - like region , i.e. this solution can be applied to blr .",
    "the idea of inferring the inclination of a black hole accretion disk from observation of its polarized continuum has been suggested by @xcite and developed for determining the orientation of the x - ray producing inner region of the accretion disk around a black hole in x - ray binary systems .",
    "another idea for using spectropolarimetric data has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "the authors used the spectropolarimetric observation of the line profile for sy 1.5 galaxy mrk  6 and assumed that the scattering region is located in the inner part of the torus . recently",
    "@xcite , based on archival data , reported the first compilation of 53 estimated agn inclinations matched with ultraviolet / optical continuum polarization measurements .",
    "but these data are obtained in the widebands of wavelength and do not include the data on the broad @xmath16 and @xmath17 emission that are used for determination of the masses of smbh .",
    "the values of the inclination angles are obtained in many cases by indirect methods .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite estimated the orientation angles @xmath13 assuming a definite mass / velocity dispersion between agn and regular galaxies where agn are located . for some seyfert galaxies the inclination estimations are obtained from optical polarization data that are produced in continuum and",
    "can not be directly related to blr .",
    "according to @xcite the warped disks can exist in agn and it means that blr and the standard accretion disk , located closely to smbh , can have different inclinations .",
    "this phenomenon is the reason why we used the polarimetric data of @xmath16 emission line presented by @xcite .",
    "we use the theory of multiple scatterings of polarized radiation @xcite and the disk like model for the blr . as the result",
    "we estimate the values of the virial factor and the mass values for smbh in agn .",
    "we have in our order the detailed atlas of the values of the polarization degree and its dependence on the inclination angle @xmath13 with the step of 0.005 for @xmath18 . besides it is convenient in some cases to use the analytical formula for the polarization degree @xmath19 obtained in @xcite :    @xmath20    the determination of the smbh mass depends strongly on the virial coefficient .",
    "according to eq.([eq02 ] ) the virial coefficient depends on the inclination angle .",
    "the calculations of @xcite and @xcite of the degree of polarization of multiple scattered radiation coming out from the flattened atmosphere is strongly dependent on the inclination angle @xmath13 .",
    "thus , according to eq.([eq02 ] ) the determination from polarization data the value of the inclination angle allows us to determine the virial coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "for determining the virial coefficient we use eq.([eq02 ] ) .",
    "the polarimetric data that are necessary for determining the virial coefficient are presented in the spectropolarimetric atlas of @xcite .",
    "they obtained the values of polarization degree and position angles for 36 type i seyfert galaxies during a number of different runs at the anglo - australian and william herschel telescopes . from 36 objects presented in the atlas of @xcite approximately 13 agns have the equal polarization degree for @xmath21 line and continuum and approximately equal values of the position angle within the error limits . for most of the observed objects",
    "there is difference between the values of the polarization degree and the position angle .",
    "this fact can testify to the difference in the inclinations between disk shaped blr and the accretion disk that can be described by shakura - sunyaev model @xcite .",
    "we shall show below that this conclusion is confirmed by polarimetric observations .",
    "continuum polarization degree of agn from palomar - green catalogue have been measured on 6-m telescope of special astrophysical observatory @xcite .",
    ".the values of the virial coefficient @xmath2 determined via measured polarization of broad @xmath21 emission of agn .",
    "polarization data from @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 is the inclination angle . [",

    "we presented a new method for estimating the smbh mass .",
    "the method is based on the observations of polarization of broad lines emission , suggesting that the blr is likely to be an optically thick flattened configuration @xcite . in this case the virial coefficient ( eq.([eq01 ] ) ) can be derived as @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath23 can be obtained from the polarization degree of radiation of optically thick plane parallel atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this result allows us to obtain an independent estimate for the central supermassive black hole mass from eq.([eq01 ] ) .",
    "the results of our calculation of the masses of smbh for specific agn are presented in table 2 .",
    "comparison of our results with the results of other authors , which used fixed values of the virial coefficients , and frequently adopted the value of @xmath24 , shows significant differences for a number of agns .",
    "it means that there is a clear distinction of our black hole masses from the virial product value that corresponds to the value of the virial coefficient @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the polarimetric observations allow to derive the ratio @xmath25 for the situation when the blr resides in a flattened , disk like configuration ( see eq.([eq04 ] ) ) .",
