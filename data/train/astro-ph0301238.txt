    "the recurrent eruptions of @xmath0 cas ( hd 224014 ) recorded over the past century are the hallmark of the exceptional atmospheric physics manifested by the yellow hypergiants .",
    "these cool luminous stars are thought to be post - red supergiants , rapidly evolving toward the blue supergiant phase ( de jager 1998 ) .",
    "they are rare enigmatic objects , and continuous high - resolution spectroscopic investigations are limited to a small sample of bright stars , often showing dissimilar spectra , but with very peculiar spectral properties .",
    "yellow hypergiants are the candidates ` par excellence ' among the cool luminous stars to investigate the physical causes for the luminosity limit of evolved stars ( i.e. de jager et al . 2001 ; lobel 2001a ; stothers & chin 2001 ) .",
    "the post - red supergiant phase assumed for @xmath0 cas mainly relies , among other cool hypergiants such as hr  8752 and irc+10420 , on a substantial atmospheric overabundance observed in n and na ( takeda & takeda - hidai 1994 ; el eid & champagne 1995 ) .",
    "there is evidence that @xmath0 cas is surrounded by a tenuous circumstellar gas shell with the observation of forbidden [ ca  ii ] optical emission lines ( lobel 1997 ) .",
    "recent high - resolution near - ir imaging with hst - wfpc2 does not show evidence of distant shells or a reflection nebula in @xmath0 cas ( schuster & humphreys 2001 ) , although complex circumstellar environments have been imaged in the cool hypergiants irc+10420 and vy cma ( humphreys et al .",
    "1997 ; smith et al .",
    "the distance to @xmath0 cas is large ( @xmath14=3.1@xmath150.5 kpc ) , and presently based on interstellar absorption and absolute visual magnitude estimates ( e.g. zsoldos & percy 1991 ) . since the distance to irc+10420 is estimated @xmath165 kpc , the lack of detection in @xmath0 cas may result from the imaging technique .",
    "its brightness causes bleeding near the star , although a range of integration times was used .",
    "the images do not show any extended structure within 0.1@xmath17 of the star , and down to the wfpc2 s read noise 2@xmath17 away .",
    "a spectroscopic study during 1993 - 95 showed that @xmath0 cas is a slowly pulsating supergiant with changes in the optical spectrum corresponding to variations of @xmath18 less than 750 k ( @xmath18=7250k @xmath19 6500 k ; lobel et al .",
    "its optical spectrum is peculiar because prominent permitted emission lines from neutral atoms sometimes appear , which are rarely seen in stellar spectra ( e.g. in 1993 december ; lobel 1997 ) .",
    "an important aspect of hypergiant spectra is the unusual large broadening observed in photospheric absorption lines .",
    "this broadening is currently attributed to large - scale atmospheric movements which assume highly supersonic velocities , while the stellar rotational broadening is small .",
    "another remarkable aspect of @xmath0 cas spectrum is the permanent , and cyclic , core doubling in low - energy resonance and subordinate photospheric absorption lines , such as fe  i , fe  ii , and ba  ii .",
    "the phenomenon is presently thought to result from a static central emission reversal which is optically thick with an excitation temperature of 3050 k , formed at a large distance from the photosphere ( lobel 1997 ) .",
    "the intensity of both adjacent absorption components periodically alters with the doppler shifts of the pulsating photosphere .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic studies of stellar atmospheric dynamics based on split absorption lines are important because they are also observed in rr lyrae variables , cepheids , and fu ori objects ( lobel 2001b ) .",
    "the line doubling appears to be physically linked with the changing spectral type of the hypergiant , because it was also observed in hr 8752 in 1960 - 70 , when this binary star had a smaller @xmath18 , and appeared to be a spectroscopic twin of @xmath0 cas ( israelian , lobel , & schmidt 1999 ) .",
    "there are presently no indications for a companion star in @xmath0 cas which , in addition to its visual brightness , makes it an important target for long - term spectroscopic monitoring to investigate the exceptional stellar atmospheric dynamics .    of the bright cool hypergiants we investigated spectroscopically over the past decade",
    ", the spectrum of @xmath0 cas appears similar to rw cep in late 1998 , displaying comparable spectral properties mentioned above . a number of fainter yellow ia - supergiants as hd 12399 and hd 179821 , are spectroscopically even more compatible .",
    "rw cep is classified as a semi - regular srd variable , although the srd class covers a variety of variable star types ( percy & kolin 2000 ) .",
    "@xmath0 cas is too luminous to be related to the majority of low - mass asymptotic giant branch stars in this class , although its quiescent small light amplitudes and spectral properties suggest kinship , which could result from its advanced evolutionary stage .",
    "surprisingly , the spectrum of @xmath0 cas lacks core emission in the broad near - uv mg  ii and ca  ii resonance absorption lines ( 7.3 ) , although it is so prominently observed in the less luminous f- and g - type ( ib ) supergiants ( i.e. lobel & dupree 2000a ) .",
    "variable and temporal emission line wings observed in h@xmath11 may signal weak quasi - chromospheric activity ( de jager , lobel , & israelian 1997 ) during phases of enhanced mass - loss with @xmath2 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath6 .",
    "observational evidence for a permanent kinetic temperature minimum in its extended outer atmosphere ( @xmath1610 % of @xmath22=400@xmath15100  @xmath23 ) is , however , presently not available .",
    "jura & kleinmann ( 1990 ) presented a model for the weak silicate emission feature observed at 9.7 @xmath7 m with @xmath24 in 1983 .",
    "they argued that dust formed at large distance from the star between 1973 and 1983 , which could be the consequence of an outburst event observed in 1945 - 47 . during the event many zero - volt excitation energy lines appeared ,",
    "not previously observed in the absorption spectrum .",
    "these atomic lines , in fact normally observed in m - type supergiants , were strongly blue - shifted , signaling the ejection of a cool circumstellar gas shell ( beardsley 1961 ) . in the following two decades after this event , a number of noteworthy papers were published in the astrophysical literature , discussing @xmath0 cas peculiar spectroscopic changes in the years during and after the outburst ( popper 1947 ; gaposchkin - payne , gaposchkin , & mayall 1947 ; keenan 1947 ; thackeray 1948 ; tai & thackeray 1948 ; beardsley 1953 ; bidelmann & mckellar 1957 ) . between 1945 and 1946",
    "the star rapidly dimmed and developed optical and near - ir tio bands .",
    "within a couple of years , the hypergiant brightened up by nearly a full magnitude , and a mid g - type spectrum was recovered around 1950 .",
    "beardsley ( 1961 ) discusses a possible brightness minimum during 1893 , which could be the first reported outburst of @xmath0 cas .",
    "more recently , boyarchuk , boyarchuk , & petrov ( 1988 ) also reported the detection of tio bands in the optical spectrum during the moderate outburst of 1985 - 87 ( 10 ) .",
    "this paper presents a detailed spectroscopic study of the recent outburst in @xmath0 cas in 2000 - 01 .",
    "our observations presently cover over 8.5 years , beginning in 1993 , of continuous monitoring with high spectral resolution , including the recent outburst event . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the term ` outburst ' or ` eruption ' to indicate the variability phases of mid 2000 when newly formed tio bands are observed in the spectrum .",
    "the terminology of ` shell or mass ejections ' , which has been used in the literature for these dramatic spectral changes is not adopted here , because we presently also report high - resolution observations of migrating discrete absorption features in the far violet extended wings of atomic lines during other variability phases .",
    "section 2 discusses the spectroscopic observations and data reduction procedures .",
    "section 3 compares , for the first time , long - term radial velocity observations with photometric monitoring , and we can therefore assign the peculiar spectral evolutions to different variability phases ( 4 & 5 ) .",
    "we observe , for example , that a prominent emission line spectrum develops during phases of fast expansion of the photosphere .",
    "a discussion of the spectral changes during the 2000 - 01 outburst is provided in 7 .",
    "we analyze prominent tio bands newly detected in the spectra , before and during the outburst minimum . from these measurements we compute in 8 the gas mass - loss rate during the eruption , for a semi - empirical model of the supersonic expanding photosphere . based on these observations we propose in 11 a thermal mechanism that drives the eruptions of @xmath0 cas .",
    "new equations are presented that correctly predict the time - scale for the outbursts .",
    "we further demonstrate numerically that these atmospheric explosions are driven by the release of ionization - recombination energy of hydrogen during the expansion , which causes @xmath18 to decrease from @xmath167250 k to below 4000 k ( 6 ) .",
    "a discussion of stellar outburst physics is provided in 12 .",
    "the conclusions of this investigation are summarized in 13 .",
    "table 1 lists our high - resolution spectroscopic observations of @xmath0 cas between 1993 january 29 and 2002 july 7 .",
    "a total of 78 spectra were observed on different nights with the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( ues ) at the nasmyth focus of the 4.2 m william herschel telescope at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( ing - wht , canary islands ) , the sofin spectrograph at the cassegrain focus of the 2.6 m nordic optical telescope ( not , canary islands ) , the echelle spectrographs of the 1 m zeiss-1000 telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of science ( sao / an , russia ) , and the fiberfed echelle spectrograph of the 1 m ritter observatory telescope ( toledo , oh ) . one echelle spectrum was recently obtained with the musicos echelle spectrograph of the 2 m bernard lyot telescope at pic du midi observatory ( pmo , france ) ( s. bagnulo 2002 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , and an additional two coud spectra were observed with the 2.6 m shajn telescope of the crimean astrophysical observatory ( crao , ukraine ) ( a. rosenbush 2002 , priv .",
    "the absorption line monitoring program includes h@xmath11 , na  @xmath10 , the single and unblended fe  i lines around 5570   of the revised multiplet table ( moore 1945 ) ( rmt ) 686 , the split fe  i lines around 5500  ( rmt 15 ) , and the ba  ii lines at @xmath255853 and @xmath256141 ( rmt 2 ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage and nominal wavelength dispersions of the spectra are listed in columns [ 7 ] and [ 9 ] of table 1 , respectively .",
    "the majority of these echelle spectra are co - added from separate exposures during the same night , with exposure times provided in column [ 10 ] .",
    "the typical continuum signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) therefore exceed 100 with wht - ues ( mostly obtained from the service time programs in good weather conditions ) , while some of our dedicated observation runs with not - sofin yielded exceptional spectra with s / n@xmath26300 , dependent on the quality of the seeing conditions .",
    "two very high - resolution ( @xmath27=170,000 , but lower s / n ) spectra were observed at sao / an in 1997 february and march , while three similar spectra were obtained in 1998 october and november with not - sofin .",
    "these spectra cover only very limited wavelength portions , with broad echelle gaps , because they focus on the detailed profiles of the selected absorption lines .",
    "five of the wht - ues spectra do not include h@xmath11 because the data were obtained with the 18-order echelle e79 grating to improve the background measurements , or with a shorter central wavelength setting to investigate the near - uv spectrum ( israelian et al . 1999 ) or the ca  ii resonance lines . in 1998",
    "october a number of not - sofin spectra were observed with different spectral resolutions on consecutive nights , to investigate the influence of the wavelength dispersion on the detailed line shapes , and to also extend the free wavelength range to beyond 1  @xmath7 m . unlike hr  8752",
    ", we do not detect he  i @xmath2510830 in @xmath0 cas .",
    "the line is also absent in the near - ir spectra of 1999 , and in the most recent observations of 2002 february .",
    "the wht - ues spectra were reduced with the standard iraf procedures .",
    "these include the average bias subtractions , order definition based on flat fields , removal of cosmic ray hits , and average flat division .",
    "a polynomial fit to the inter - orders is used to remove the background .",
    "the wavelength calibration is performed with a th - ar hollow - cathode lamp spectrum , and the pixel - to - wavelength mapping is iterated by increasing the number of calibration emission lines in the echelle order solutions to accuracies typically better than 0.02   .",
    "the not - sofin spectra were also calibrated with a th - ar source ( or lamp ) spectrum obtained after each stellar exposure , to eliminate any temporal changes in the spectrograph in a combined wavelength solution with the use of the 4a software package ( ilyin 2000 ) .",
    "it also includes a 2d - spline fit to remove scattered light , and weighted spectral order extraction which excludes the cosmic spikes from the fit .",
    "the sum of numerous master flat fields with overlapping orders is used to correct the pixel - to - pixel noise for the high s / n echelle images .",
    "the exposure times for the high - resolution observations ( @xmath27@xmath2080,000 ) have been increased to exceed 100 , while values above 50 are obtained for the lower resolution observations .",
    "the sao / an spectra were reduced with the dech code ( galazutdinov 1992 ) , which performs the standard echelle reduction steps .",
    "most of these spectra have a s / n@xmath20100 per resolution element .",
    "comparison th - ar exposures are obtained for the wavelength calibrations , although some of the dispersion solutions were also based on sharp telluric lines .",
    "the s / n of the ritter spectra is between 100 and 200 .",

    "the mean accuracy of our wavelength calibrations for the spectra of table 1 is better than @xmath151  @xmath28 .",
    "note that these echelle spectra are not calibrated in the absolute flux scale , and that the placement of local continuum levels is either visually estimated , or results from a detailed spectral synthesis ( 7 ) .",
    "separate from the line profile monitoring , 88 radial velocity observations were obtained between 1990 july 10 and 2002 february 7 at the oak ridge observatory ( oro of the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ) with the 1.5-m wyeth reflector and an echelle spectrograph .",
    "a single echelle order was recorded using a photon - counting intensified reticon detector at a central wavelength of 5187   , with a spectral coverage of 45   .",
    "the strongest features present in this window are the lines of the  b triplet .",
    "the resolving power is @xmath29 , and the nominal s / n ranges from about 25 to 100 per resolution element of 8.5  km  s@xmath30 .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed in the standard way with th - ar lamp exposures taken before and after each stellar exposure .",
    "the rms residual , from the 30@xmath1935 calibration lines used in the dispersion solution , was typically around 0.01   .",
    "the stability of the zero - point of our velocity system was monitored by means of exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small systematic run - to - run corrections were applied with the methods described by latham ( 1992 ) .",
    "internal errors for each of our velocities were computed using the iraf task xcsao ( kurtz & mink 1998 ) , and range mostly from 1.5  km  s@xmath30 to 2.0  km  s@xmath30 .    in the next two sections we investigate the radial velocity changes obtained from individual line profiles in the high - resolution spectra .",
    "a comparison with the radial velocity monitoring at oro is provided in 5 .",
    "in figure 1 we compare the radial velocity curve with the @xmath1-brightness curve observed over the last 8.5 years .",
    "the solid dots are photo - electric measurements offered in percy , kolin , & henry ( 2000 ) .",
    "their high - precision @xmath1 , @xmath27 , and @xmath31 observations are complemented with visual brightness estimates from the aavso ( _ solid boxes _ ) .",
    "visual brightness estimates during the outburst between jd 2451100 and jd 2452400 are offered by the afoev ( french association of variable star observers ) .",
    "the light curve shows how the star dims by @xmath32 @xmath19 @xmath33 , from an unusual high brightness maximum of @xmath1@xmath16@xmath34 , to a deep minimum between 2000 september and december . in the half year after the deep minimum the star rapidly brightened up to average @xmath1-magnitude values",
    "observed before the outburst , however recently assuming another very bright visual maximum in late december 2001 .",
    "the lower panel of figure 1 shows the radial velocity curve ( @xmath35 ) of the photosphere that we measure from the bisector at half intensity minimum of the unblended fe  i @xmath255572 absorption line ( _ solid dots _ ) .",
    "these values have been added after jd 2450100 ( 1995 december ) to the radial velocity curve in figure 8 of lobel et al .",
    "the dotted line is computed from a linear interpolation of the fe  i line _ profiles _ between consecutive observations , marked by the vertical lines .",
    "note that the detailed changes of the line shape also contain information about the intensity changes between the observations , but which would not be represented with a simple spline fit to the radial velocity data . although usually small , the difference is appreciable during phases when the line rapidly becomes much deeper and more asymmetric , while shifting blueward , as we observe during the outburst .",
    "the numbers correspond to the spectrum numbers of table 1 .",
    "the monitoring suggests that during the quiescent variability phases before jd 2451000 the radial velocity variations with a ( rapid ) decrease of absolute velocity are followed by a velocity increase that lasts considerably longer . after this time",
    "the unusually large velocity variations observed during the pre - outburst and the outburst cycle become rather symmetric .    for comparison",
    "the @xmath35-curve is overplotted with the light curve ( _ dotted line in upper panel of fig . 1 _ ) .",
    "the star becomes brightest for phases soon after the photosphere begins to expand .",
    "the stellar center - of - mass velocity of @xmath1947  @xmath28 was determined from the line bisector at half maximum of the forbidden [ ca  ii ] @xmath257323 emission line , which was prominent in 1993 december ( lobel 1997 , p. 53 ) .",
    "we observe four phases between jd 2449300 and jd 2451000 with rapid brightness decreases that lag the fast ( absolute ) radial velocity decrements by @xmath163.5 months .",
    "the radial velocity minima , marking maximum photospheric expansion , do not coincide with the @xmath1-brightness minima . the phase lag is clearly observed during the pre - outburst variability cycle of jd 2451000@xmath192451500 , and during the actual outburst . during the outburst , the @xmath35-values decrease from @xmath16@xmath1930  @xmath28",
    "to @xmath1965  @xmath28 in @xmath16200 d , which is followed @xmath16100 d later by a steep decline of the @xmath1-magnitude over the same period of time .",
    "we observe a strong correlation between the velocity and brightness amplitudes during the past 8.5 years .",
    "these observations show that the flow dynamics of the photospheric layers where the fe  i @xmath255572 line forms are strongly related to the overall thermal conditions of the atmosphere ( @xmath18 and @xmath36 ) in which the stellar @xmath1-band continuum is produced , near the maximum of the spectral energy distribution of this cool star .",
    "it signals that the global photospheric dynamics due to pulsation causes the thermal conditions of the atmosphere to vary with time .",
    "figure 2 shows the detailed line profile changes of h@xmath11 , fe  i @xmath255572 , and fe  i @xmath255506 ( _ panels left to right _ ) .",
    "the line profiles are plotted in heliocentric velocity scale and have been normalized to the local continuum level , indicated by the right - hand horizontal line for each observation night .",
    "the stellar continuum level is estimated with a polynomial fit through wavelength regions of maximum intensity in the vicinity of the line , which remain sufficiently ` flat ' with the spectral changes , and indicate the absence of weak absorption features . the fe  i @xmath255572 line has been continuum normalized through the flat intensity maxima beyond the line wings , while h@xmath11 requires a local continuum region around @xmath19320  @xmath28 because its violet wing sometimes blends with ti  ii @xmath256559 .",
    "the split fe  i @xmath255506 line requires even farther continuum definition points because the violet line wing is more extended , while the red line wing is weakly blended .",
    "the same continuum fitting points have systematically been applied for a consistent measurement of equivalent width changes in h@xmath11 and fe  i @xmath255572 ( 6 ) , and for the radial velocity measurements from the line bisectors .",
    "the vertical dotted line is drawn at the stellar rest velocity of @xmath1947@xmath152  @xmath28 .",
    "for an improved visualization of the detailed line profile evolutions we plot dynamic line spectra in figure 3 .",
    "the observed line profiles are linearly interpolated between consecutive observation nights ( _ left - hand tickmarks _ ) . while the velocity amplitudes and overall line profile evolutions in fe  i @xmath255572 and fe  i @xmath255506 are similar , the h@xmath11 line shape and velocity changes are notably different .",
    "the difference signals different regions for the mean formation of h@xmath11 and the fe  i lines .",
    "the absorption portions of the fe  i lines are formed around photospheric levels of @xmath192@xmath37@xmath38@xmath370 , and these low - excitation energy lines can develop extended violet wings , produced in a cool optically thick expanding stellar wind at smaller optical depths .",
    "the body of the fe  i lines therefore tracks the photospheric movements over time , while h@xmath11 forms higher , over a much more extended region of the upper atmosphere .",
    "the extended h@xmath11 envelope of the hypergiant produces broad emission line wings at either or both sides of the central absorption core due to photon scattering in our line of sight . on the other hand",
    ", the dynamic h@xmath11 spectrum also reveals large doppler shifts between 1993 and 1997 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the h@xmath11 absorption core is rather optically thick , and results from radiation transfer through a moving line formation region , in front of the stellar disk , where photons are removed from or scattered out of our line of sight .",
    "the outburst of 2000 - 01 is characterized by the strong blue - shifts of the fe  i lines in the upper portions of figs . 2 & 3 .",
    "these neutral lines become much deeper and broader than usual in the spectra of summer 2000 .",
    "note that the split fe  i @xmath255506 line has a central emission reversal which remains around the stellar rest velocity , while a far extended violet wing unfolds during the outburst .",
    "our monitoring also reveals that many of the split lines in the optical spectrum of @xmath0 cas develop discrete and weak absorption features at high velocity in the violet line wing .",
    "these features migrate toward the central emission core over a long period of time ( several years ) .",
    "it indicates the regular formation in the supersonic stellar wind of circumstellar gas ` shells ' that gradually decelerate and dissolve .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the split line features will be given elsewhere .",
    "a very remarkable aspect of the dynamic spectra is that the h@xmath11 core does not display the strong blue - shifts observed in the photospheric lines during the outburst .",
    "instead , the h@xmath11 absorption core becomes very weak during the deep brightness minimum .",
    "a comparison of the shape changes with h@xmath11 in betelgeuse and @xmath7 cep is discussed in 7.2 .",
    "for an improved comparison of the detailed evolutions of the three line profiles with the stellar brightness changes , we convert the dynamic spectra into a movie sequencealobel . ] .",
    "the day - to - day changes of the line shapes are shown together with the @xmath1-magnitude curve ( _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "the movie reveals how the h@xmath11 absorption core strongly red - shifts between 1995 and early 1999 ( around jd 2451200 ) , following the trend of the fe  i lines .",
    "after this time , the star rapidly brightens up to the very bright maximum of jd 2451600 ( early 2000 ) , leading up to the outburst event . during this pre - outburst phase unusual strong emission develops in the blue wing of h@xmath11 ( the white emission ` spot ' in figure 3",
    "is at maximum normalized intensity of 25% above the continuum level ) , while the red - shifted absorption core becomes very broad and extended , indicating the collapse of the h@xmath11-envelope in our line of sight .",
    "however , during this pre - outburst cycle the fe  i lines also strongly red - shift , indicating a similar collapse or compression of the deeper photosphere . the combined spectral and photometric",
    "monitoring indicates that the outbursts of the hypergiant are preceded by phases of unusual fast contraction of the upper and lower atmosphere , during which the star quickly brightens up and strongly increases its @xmath18 ( 6 ) .",
    "we note that a comparable strong emission increase of the blue h@xmath11 wing has more recently been observed during a new very bright maximum around jd 2452270 ( 2001 december ) .",
    "the very extended red absorption core of h@xmath11 observed during this period , followed by fast blueshifts of fe  i in early 2002 , could suggest that a new outburst of @xmath0 cas is imminent .",
    "this appears supported by the fact that in 2002 july 07 an unusual h@xmath11 profile was observed with a very extended red absorption wing .",
    "the profile is shown in the left - hand panel of figure 2 ( _ top _ ) .",
    "most remarkably , the core of the line is split , and its large broadening has not been observed before . the recent evolution of the fe  i @xmath255572 is also strikingly similar to the changes observed before the 2000 - 01 outburst . if the star brightens up to a new very large brightness maximum over the next half year a new , and possibly more dramatic , outburst event could be expected .",
    "the radial velocity curves of fe  i @xmath255572 ( _ filled circles _ ) and h@xmath11 ( _ triangles _ ) are compared in figure 4 .",
    "these velocity values are measured from the absorption line bisectors , and listed in table 2 .",
    "the box symbols show the oro radial velocity values , also listed in table 3 .",
    "these velocities are obtained from a cross - correlation technique applied to oro spectra observed in the 5166 @xmath19 5211  wavelength range .",
    "the template for @xmath0  cas is selected from a library of pre - computed synthetic spectra based on the latest model atmospheres by r. kurucz ( nordstrm et al .",
    "1994 ) , covering a large range of stellar parameters and calculated for the precise wavelength window and resolution of the spectra . as described in more detail below , the effective temperature of @xmath0  cas varies considerably over the pulsation cycles . for the purpose of deriving radial velocities from these spectra , however , we adopt a fixed temperature of 6250  k for our template .",
    "limited changes around this value have only a small effect on the results .",
    "similarly , to match the line broadening of @xmath0  cas we adopt a @xmath39-value of 40  km  s@xmath30 , as well as a surface gravity of @xmath36 = 2.5 ( the nearest value in our template library ) and [ m / h ] = 0.0 .",
    "the effect of the gravity and metallicity parameters on the radial velocities is negligible .",
    "the one @xmath40-error computed from the cross - correlation method is also shown in figure 4 , and listed in column [ 5 ] of table 3 .",
    "there is good correspondence between the radial velocity values obtained from the bisector of the fe  i @xmath255572 line in the high - resolution spectra , and from cross - correlating the oro spectra .",
    "both methods independently yield the large doppler shifts observed during the pre - outburst cycle and the outburst .",
    "the velocity curves agree to within 5  @xmath28 . only for the observations around jd 2449600",
    "does the cross - correlation yield @xmath35-values of 9@xmath1910  @xmath28 smaller than obtained from the fe  i line bisector measurements .",
    "a detailed comparison of the oro spectra of this epoch , with the high - resolution spectra in the same wavelength range , shows that the difference results from the many deep and broad absorption lines in this part of the spectrum . during this epoch ,",
    "the deep lines develop enhanced absorption line wings , indicating a variability phase with stronger wind expansion .",
    "the deep lines are more asymmetric toward shorter wavelengths than the weaker fe  i @xmath255572 line .",
    "consequently , the cross - correlation method samples more of the outflow by the larger wind opacity in the strong and broad lines .",
    "we therefore think that the fe  i radial velocity curve is more sensitive to the oscillations of the deeper photosphere , because absorption contributions from extra opacity in the variable wind are less for this weaker line .",
    "this is further supported by the behavior of the fe  i radial velocity curve which closely matches the @xmath1-brightness changes ( fig .",
    "1 ) , although the line was monitored by three different spectrographs during this epoch .",
    "stronger blue - shifts for the deep absorption lines were for example measured from the bisector of the y  ii @xmath254900 line during this epoch ( fig .",
    "8 of lobel et al . 1998 ) .",
    "note further that during the pre - outburst and outburst cycles the entire fe  i line profile , and the absorption line spectrum , strongly doppler shift ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which explains why the measurements from both methods agree within a few @xmath28 during these events .",
    "we also computed the radial velocity changes based on the method of line moments .",
    "the moments of a line are defined by @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the stellar rest velocity , and @xmath43 the normalized line flux in the velocity scale .",
    "the center of gravity velocity of the fe  i @xmath255572 line is computed from the first moment @xmath44 with @xmath45 , where the zeroth moment @xmath46 is the equivalent width of the line .",
    "the radial velocity values determined from the line half width at half intensity minimum in figure 4 are almost identical to the @xmath47-values .",
    "the open circles plot the velocity variations of the line determined from the second moment @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the periodicity and phase of the @xmath50-curve are very similar to the radial velocity curve ( _ solid dots _ ) , which indicates that the higher moments of the fe  i line do not reveal photospheric oscillation modes of a higher frequency .",
    "the velocities determined from the higher line moments do not show correlations with the @xmath1-brightness curve , which is unlike the strong correlation observed with the zeroth ( 6 ) and the first moment .",
    "we think that the method can not detect possible higher oscillation frequencies , based on detailed profile changes from the higher line moments , because the photospheric lines of the hypergiant are broadened by supersonic macrobroadening velocities ( of @xmath1621  @xmath28 ) , which strongly increases the line breadth .",
    "small changes of the line shape , caused by intrinsic variability , when integrating over the stellar disk ( e.g. due to possible non - radial atmospheric movements ) , therefore become smoothed out by the overall large line broadening .",
    "it is however also possible that the moment method can not detect higher oscillation frequencies because the time resolution of our dataset appears too coarse for shorter time intervals .",
    "the application of the line moment method is further complicated by the fact that our dataset is not fully homogeneous ( four spectrographs were used ) in both s / n and spectral resolving power , which influences the velocity curves obtained from the higher moments .",
    "a remarkable aspect of the radial velocity curve is that the photosphere reveals an average variability period of @xmath16300 d between consecutive velocity maxima from jd 2449200 to jd 2450450 , while the h@xmath11 absorption core only strongly red - shifts during this period of time .",
    "it signals a strongly velocity stratified dynamic atmosphere in which the deeper photospheric layers oscillate at a higher frequency , indicating smaller mean radius displacements than the upper h@xmath11-atmosphere . after this period",
    ", both atmospheric regions strongly red - shift , indicating a global collapse ( by @xmath1613  @xmath28 from the stellar rest velocity ) during less than 200 d. this phase is followed by a blue - shift of the photosphere during which the moderate brightness maximum of jd 2450750 occurs .",
    "however , h@xmath11 remains strongly redshifted , indicating a continuous collapse of the upper atmosphere . over the next variability phase the photosphere strongly blue - shifts during the pre - outburst cycle",
    "this phase is followed by the development of a very extended red line wing in the absorption core of h@xmath11 , together with an unusual strong redshift of the photosphere ( by @xmath1618  @xmath28 from the stellar rest velocity ) , which precedes the very large brightness maximum of jd 2451600 , and the subsequent outburst minimum .",
    "these observations indicate substantial changes in the thermal conditions of the stellar ( @xmath1 ) continuum formation region with the growing pulsation amplitudes .",
    "the amplified photospheric oscillations lead up to the outburst event , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "figure 5 compares the visual light curve with the equivalent width ( @xmath51 ) measurements of fe  i @xmath255572 ( _ open circles _ ) , listed in column [ 4 ] of table 2 .",
    "the @xmath51-values range between 282 m and 642 m , with typical errorbars of @xmath1515 m . the errors are computed by placing the continuum level for the line intensity normalization 1% higher and 1% lower .",
    "similar error values are obtained for h@xmath11 ( _ crosses _ ; net equivalent width ) , and for fe  ii @xmath255325 ( _ open triangles _ ) , also listed in column [ 8 ] of table 2 .",
    "we find a very strong correlation between the @xmath1-magnitude and the @xmath51-value of the fe  i line .",
    "it shows that this neutral absorption line is very sensitive to variations of the local excitation conditions , caused by changes in the thermal circumstances of the deeper photosphere with pulsation , as we discussed in 3 from the radial velocity curve of the line .",
    "we find a tight relationship between the @xmath1-magnitude , and @xmath51(fe  i 5572  ) expressed in m : @xmath52    on the other hand , we also find that the @xmath51-changes of the fe  ii line are anti - correlated with @xmath1 .",
    "this reveals that the population of the energy levels of neutral and singly - ionized iron lines in the atmosphere of @xmath0 cas is dependent of the variable local excitation conditions , and strongly sensitive of the abundance of the iron ions . in the low - density atmospheres of cool supergiants with @xmath18 around 7000  k",
    ", the iron ionization balance is very sensitive to changes of the local thermal conditions , which causes the strength of fe  i and fe  ii lines to vary oppositely with small variations of @xmath18 .    in the lower panel of figure 5",
    "we estimate the variation of @xmath18 , based on the @xmath51-changes of the fe  i line with pulsation .",
    "the atmospheric conditions for the optical spectrum of 1993 december 20 , and of 1995 april 18 have been determined in lobel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from @xmath51 measurements of 23 fe  i and 11 fe  ii lines .",
    "the spectrum of 1993 corresponds to @xmath18=7250@xmath15200 k , and the spectrum of 1995 to @xmath18=6500@xmath15200 k , whereby @xmath36 decreases from 1.0 to 0.5 , from ( near ) maximum to minimum @xmath1-brightness .",
    "the decrease of @xmath18 corresponds to an increase from 393 m to 551 m in fe  i @xmath255572 , which we utilize to estimate the @xmath18 for other variability phases by a linear interpolation : @xmath53 the @xmath18-estimates from the @xmath51-values of the fe  i line are marked with open circles .",
    "we note however that the direct correlation of the equivalent width values with the @xmath1-curve of equation ( 1 ) breaks down for the deep outburst minimum observations of 2000 september 17 and 20 . during the outburst ,",
    "the strong decrease of @xmath18 causes the population of this neutral line to shift from the linear to the flat part of the curve of growth . in these conditions the line depth saturates and",
    "becomes no longer directly correlated with the steep brightness decrease .",
    "an estimation of @xmath18 during the outburst can therefore not be obtained from an extrapolation of the @xmath54-values observed during the outburst .",
    "on the other hand , the strong correlation of the fe  i line with @xmath1 during the quiescent pulsation phases enables us instead to directly estimate @xmath18 from @xmath1 , by inserting equation ( 1 ) in equation ( 2 ) : @xmath55 the correlation reveals how @xmath18 varies by @xmath163000 k during the outburst , from a very high value @xmath38000 k around jd  2451600 ( 2000 april ) , to a low @xmath18@xmath35000 k during the deep brightness minimum of 2000 september and december .",
    "the extrapolation with equation ( 3 ) , based on @xmath1 , applies because we further check from spectral synthesis calculations that the spectra observed during the deep outburst minimum correspond to @xmath18-values below 5000 k.    it is of note that the fe  i measurements after jd 2450250 show a _ decrease _ of @xmath51 to a minimum value around jd 2450409 .",
    "however , the @xmath1-brightness estimates suggest an ongoing dimming of the star , which contradicts the strong @xmath51-@xmath1 correlation observed during other quiescent variability phases .",
    "we think however that the visual brightness estimates during this period ( spring term ) could be biased by the low altitude of the star for observers in the northern hemisphere .",
    "this is likely the case because our @xmath51-values are measured from spectra of two different spectrographs , yielding a continuous sequence with a local minimum around jd 2450409 , while the more accurate photo - electric @xmath1 measurements were only obtained after this date ( fig . 5 , _",
    "solid dots in the upper panel _ ) .",
    "this is further supported since the @xmath51-curve , with a local minimum around this epoch , also confirms the variability period of @xmath16300 d , that is observed between other consecutive brightness maxima , and also noticeable in the @xmath35-curve ( 5 ) .",
    "alternatively , when taking all visual brightness estimates at face value it would indicate that the correlation equations are not always perfect for this semi - regular variable star .",
    "we further tested the large @xmath18 decrease during the outburst with the oro spectra .",
    "the spectra are run through a grid of kurucz models with 4500 k @xmath37",
    "@xmath18 @xmath37 8000 k. for each of the spectra , the cross - correlation method selects a template spectrum that best fits the observed spectrum .",
    "the @xmath18 and line broadening are varied during the iterations , while the model gravity is set to a constant value .",
    "a rotational convolution is performed for the line broadening , but without changing the line equivalent width ( i.e. the microturbulence broadening is assumed to remain constant ) .",
    "this rather simplified method of determining atmospheric changes with phase yields however a clear correlation between @xmath18 and the line broadening , in the sense that the spectral lines are broader when @xmath18 is higher .",
    "the correlation is very strong during the pre - outburst cycle and the actual outburst when @xmath18 strongly varies .",
    "the iterations reveal that @xmath18 increases from @xmath36000  k on jd 2451371 to @xmath37600 k on jd 2451598 ( around the large @xmath1-brightness maximum before the outburst ) . after this period ,",
    "the deeper photosphere rapidly expands , while the star quickly dims by more than a magnitude in @xmath1 . around the brightness minimum of jd 2451800",
    "we compute that @xmath18 assumes the smallest value in the model grid of 4500 k. the temperature minimum lasts for only @xmath16100 d , while the photosphere quickly contracts from maximum expansion velocity to the stellar rest velocity ( a @xmath35 decrease by @xmath318  @xmath56 ) .",
    "the star subsequently brightens up by @xmath57 within the next 100 d , returning to @xmath18 above 6000  k before jd 2452000 .",
    "the rapid @xmath18 excursion by more than 3000 k for the outburst of @xmath0 cas , obtained from both methods described above , indicates that it results from the exceptionally large and fast mean atmospheric displacements we observe before and during the event . in the next section",
    "we investigate the changes of the optical spectrum in more detail .",
    "we show that the above derived @xmath18-values are in close agreement with the detailed spectral synthesis models in which the gravity acceleration and the turbulence broadening are also varied . during the outburst",
    "minimum @xmath18 decreases so rapidly that tio absorption bands can form , which are typically only observed in m - type ( or very late k - type ) stars as @xmath7 cep and betelgeuse .",
    "we observe that during phases of fast photospheric expansion a prominent emission line spectrum develops with line intensity maxima above the local continuum level ( _ vertical dashed lines labeled a and b in fig . 1 _ ) .",
    "the spectrum of 1993 december ( _ labeled a _ ) corresponds to a phase around maximum brightness with @xmath18=7250 k , @xmath36=0.5 , and a projected microturbulence velocity of @xmath58=12  @xmath28 ( lobel et al .",
    "strong emission lines of low - excitation energy metals as fe  i , ni  i , and ca  i have been identified ( see lobel 1997 , p. 45 ) .",
    "the presently observed strong correlation of emission line appearance in the spectrum of @xmath0 cas with the radial velocity curve indicates that their formation is related to enhanced excitation in the accelerating outflow during very fast photospheric expansions .",
    "the latter is supported by the far violet extended absorption line wings we observe during these phases , signaling the development of an optically thick expanding wind from the supergiant when @xmath18 is high .",
    "these very extended violet line wings were for example not observed in 1995 april , when @xmath18 decreased to 6500 k , and the star reached the @xmath1-brightness minimum around jd 2449820 .",
    "since the emission line spectrum remains static ( and slightly blueshifted around the sound speed ) it can emerge from a steady shock interface between the fast stellar wind that collides with denser circumstellar , or perhaps interstellar material , expelled during the violent ( eruptive ) mass - loss history of the hypergiant .",
    "figure 6 compares the spectral changes during the outburst for a small wavelength region around the fe  i @xmath256358 line .",

    "several other permitted low - energy fe  i and ca  i lines were observed in emission ( lobel 1997 , chap .",
    "4 ) .    the high - resolution spectral monitoring between 1994 and 1997 does not reveal prominent optical emission lines .",
    "the radial velocity curve ( fig . 1 , _ lower panel _ ) shows an overall decrease of atmospheric outflow during this period from jd 2449400 to jd 2450700 .",
    "however , in 1998 october ( fig .",
    "6 , _ spectrum labeled b _ ) we detect the optical emission lines again above the stellar continuum level .",
    "similar to 1993 december , the absorption lines develop extended violet wings due to enhanced opacity in the stellar wind . during these phases of increased @xmath18 with fast wind expansion , @xmath0 cas optical absorption line spectrum , mainly composed of neutral atomic species , becomes rather weak , and the peculiar emission line spectrum can therefore appear above the level of the continuum .",

    "the spectrum of 1999 may in figure 6 ( _ solid line labeled c _ ) , observed before this maximum , indicates @xmath18=5750 k and @xmath36=0.5 from a best fit ( _ dotted line _ )",
    ". hence , @xmath18 decreases by @xmath161500 k after 1998 october , while the wind expansion strongly decelerates after early 1999 during the pre - outburst cycle .",
    "the high - resolution spectrum of 2000 july 19 in figure 6 ( _ solid line labeled d _ ) is observed within a month after maximum photospheric expansion velocity .",
    "note that the continuum level of the spectrum is shifted down for display purposes .",
    "we observe that the entire absorption line spectrum displaces toward the shorter wavelengths .",
    "it reveals an average expansion of a large fraction of the deeper atmosphere , where the bulk of the photospheric spectrum forms .",
    "the synthetic spectrum fit ( _ middle dotted line _ ) shows that @xmath18 decreases to 4250 k with @xmath36=0 .",
    "hence , our detailed spectral modeling also reveals a decrease of at least 3000 k during the outburst of @xmath0  cas .    a comparison with the spectrum of the m - type supergiants betelgeuse ( _ dashed line _ ) ( with @xmath18=3500 k ) , and @xmath7 cep ( _ lower solid line _ ) in figure 6 shows that the cores of neutral v  i , fe  i , ti  i , and cr  i lines in @xmath0 cas become considerably deeper during the strong @xmath1-brightness decrease .",
    "we model the outburst spectrum by neglecting molecular lines in the synthesis .",
    "the good fit reveals that molecular absorption remains weak , and the local continuum level is mainly determined by blends of atomic lines . on the other hand ,",
    "the synthetic spectrum of betelgeuse is computed ( _ lower dotted line _ ) by including many molecular lines as tio , @xmath59 , cn , etc .",
    "( kurucz 1996 ) .",
    "however , molecular opacity contributes substantially to the decrease of the local continuum level in betelgeuse and @xmath7 cep ( to @xmath160.5 in normalized intensity ) .",
    "contributions from tio opacity are very important for an accurate synthesis of these m - type spectra ( for a discussion see lobel & dupree 2000b ) .",
    "our spectral observations and modeling indicate that the strong brightness decrease observed for @xmath0 cas between 2000 april and october corresponds to a decrease of @xmath18 by at least 3000  k , and probably by as much as 3500  k to the deep brightness minimum of late 2000 . in less than half a year after the deep minimum the optical spectrum returns to @xmath18@xmath35750  k around 2001 february ( _ solid line labeled e _ ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure 5 shows that the changes of the h@xmath11 profile are uncorrelated with the variability of @xmath1 .",
    "however , we observe a strong decrease of the ( total ) equivalent line width , while the absorption portion of the line strongly red - shifts between jd 2449200 and jd 2450450 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . during this period , the violet extension of the h@xmath11 absorption core diminishes ( fig .",
    "2 ) , indicating that the wind in the upper h@xmath11-atmosphere stalls , and begins to collapse onto the deeper photosphere .",
    "the @xmath51-changes of h@xmath11 also occur much slower than observed for the iron lines , which confirms the rather different mean formation region of h@xmath11 .",
    "figure 7 shows a number of high - resolution spectra around h@xmath11 for the epochs labeled _ a _ to _ d _ in figure 1 .",
    "we observe that the ti  ii absorption line , shortward of h@xmath11 , becomes weaker in the outburst spectrum ( _ d _ ) , due to a decrease of the excitation temperature in the line formation region . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutral fe  i and v  i lines , also labeled in the graph , become deeper and assume intensities comparable to these lines observed in betelgeuse ( _ long dashed line _ ) and @xmath7  cep ( _ long dash - dotted line _ ) . during the outburst the h@xmath11 absorption core does not blue - shift , but instead remains centered around the stellar rest velocity , while the absorption core becomes weaker .",
    "the line also develops weak asymmetric emission wings at both sides of the central absorption core , reminiscent of the strongly self - absorbed emission lines observed in the near - uv spectra of betelgeuse , and of other cool luminous stars ( i.e. lobel & dupree 2001 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that laser pulse laboratory experiments in hydrogen plasma produce strong balmer emission lines during ionization recombination .",
    "fill et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue that the observed emission production time - scales and population balance calculations reveal that three - body recombination is the main mechanism populating the levels that emit the balmer lines during these experiments .",
    "their measurements involve however electron densities @xmath60@xmath3@xmath61  @xmath62 at gas pressures of @xmath63=@xmath64  @xmath65 , while hydrostatic photospheric models of @xmath0 cas assume @xmath60@xmath37@xmath66  @xmath62 for @xmath63@xmath3710  @xmath65 .",
    "nevertheless , conditions of larger @xmath60 and @xmath63 can result by strong shock compression during the outburst , producing enhanced line emission in a cooling and expanding wake .",
    "the emission wings observed for h@xmath11 in the outburst spectra of @xmath0 cas could therefore result from the recombination of partially ionized hydrogen gas .",
    "the filling in of h@xmath11 by line emission due to recombination during the outburst is also supported by the lack of evidence for a steady chromosphere in @xmath0 cas . in betelgeuse and @xmath7 cep",
    "the stellar chromosphere strongly populates the h@xmath11 transition , which produces the deep h@xmath11 absorption cores in these m - type stars . however , if these supergiants had no chromosphere , the h@xmath11 absorption core would become invisible against the photospheric spectrum .",
    "this can be illustrated with a detailed synthesis of their optical spectra ( which are mainly formed by tio opacity ) ( _ dotted spectrum _ ) , excluding the model for the chromosphere ( see lobel & dupree 2000b ) .",
    "the outburst spectrum of @xmath0 cas , with a comparable low @xmath18 , shows however much weaker h@xmath11 absorption with prominent emission line wings .",
    "it indicates that the line does not become excited in a stellar chromosphere .",
    "if a chromosphere were present during the outburst , much stronger h@xmath11 absorption would have to develop .",
    "this would prevent the recombination of partially ionized hydrogen in the outer atmosphere , and hence would suppress the formation of emission line wings .",
    "the strongly self - reversed shape of the h@xmath11 emission line during the outburst can be produced if the h@xmath11 transition is sufficiently optically thick .",
    "since we observe that the central absorption core remains almost static during the outburst , this would indicate that the central line scattering region is formed far above the h@xmath11 emission formation region , and does not share the dynamics of the outburst .",
    "this implies that @xmath0  cas h@xmath11 atmosphere is considerably more extended than the dimensions derived from radial displacements based on the photospheric radial velocity changes during the outburst ( 8.2 ) .",
    "detailed semi - empirical modeling of the balmer lines of @xmath0 cas will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it is of note that our not - sofin observations of the g2@xmath19g5 supergiant hd 179821 also show variable red- and blueshifted emission in the h@xmath11 absorption core .",
    "this supergiant has recently been proposed as a low - mass post - agb candidate , based on a lte abundance analysis by thvenin et al .",
    "its far - ir excess signals a cool detached dust shell .",
    "there is however no consensus on the evolutionary status .",
    "its high expansion velocity of 34  @xmath28 is much larger than the value of 10@xmath1915  @xmath28 for low - mass post - agb stars , which rather suggests a massive supergiant .",
    "the emission humps in h@xmath11 result from nlte - effects in a fast and spherically expanding wind ( dupree et al .",
    "1984 ) , inside the dust cavity .",
    "the emission sporadically appears above the stellar continuum level , as is observed in @xmath0  cas .",
    "the absence of a permanent chromosphere in @xmath0 cas is further supported by the spectral monitoring of ca  ii h & k. emission reversals in the cores of these resonance lines are classic indicators of chromospheric activity in cool stars .",
    "however , near - uv observations with wht - ues ( 1996 december 26 ) and not - sofin ( 1998 october 6 ) do not show ca  ii emission in the broad absorption cores . in figure 8",
    "the ca  ii h & k lines only reveal a deep central core with zero intensity , within the limited spectral noise levels .",
    "this is unlike the prominent core emission observed in the ca  ii k line of betelgeuse ( _ dashed line lower panel _ ) , modeled in lobel & dupree ( 2000b ) with a kinetic temperature of the chromosphere not in excess of 5500  k. note however that the broad wings of ca  ii h & k show permanent emission lines of fe  i ( _ labeled rmt 45 and 43 _ ) .",
    "recent observations with not - sofin ( 2002 january 29 ) of the ca  ii h line after the outburst of @xmath0 cas neither reveal a central emission core ( _ dashed line in upper panel _ ) .",
    "the absence of a steady chromosphere in @xmath0 cas is also apparent by the absence of central emission in the mg  ii @xmath67 & @xmath68 lines , discussed and modeled in lobel et al .",
    "it is of note that we neither observe central emission in ca  ii k of hd 179821 , indicating a massive ia - supergiant like @xmath0 cas .",
    "we observe a remarkable evolution in the split na  @xmath10 lines of @xmath0 cas during the 2000 - 01 outburst .",
    "the high - resolution spectra in figure 9 show that the central portion of the lines , between the adjacent black absorption troughs , turns in emission above the local continuum level ( _ solid lines labeled d _ ) on 2000 july 19 and august 2 .",
    "the prominent central emission is also observed in the lower resolution spectra of september 17 , 20 , & 21 ( table 1 , profiles not shown in fig .",

    "another weaker feature is also observed shortward of stellar rest velocity in both lines of the doublet .",
    "it is of importance to point out that the contamination of interstellar absorption in the na  @xmath10 lines of @xmath0 cas ( at a distance of @xmath163.1 kpc ) , and of other distant hypergiants , has always cast doubt on an interpretation which attributes the curious splitting to a central emission reversal .",
    "however , the high - resolution outburst spectra clearly show that central emission does ( at least partly ) involve the formation of these very complex resonance lines .    in order to investigate interstellar line contributions we compare with the na  @xmath10 lines observed in hr  8752 .",
    "the thin solid lines of the small panel show both doublet lines of @xmath0 cas in the same velocity scale , compared to these lines in hr  8752 ( _ thin dashed lines _ ) , observed with not - sofin in 1998 october , with very high resolution ( @xmath27@xmath16160,000 ) .",
    "both hypergiants are only 7@xmath6922@xmath70 apart in the sky , and reveal narrow absorption components around @xmath1950  @xmath28 and @xmath1930  @xmath28 ( with a similar fwhm of @xmath310  @xmath28 ) .",
    "these distinct absorption features can therefore be attributed to high - velocity clouds of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the direction of the cas ob5 association .",
    "the interstellar absorption partly distorts the shape of the stellar central emission line , so that its actual intensity can not accurately be determined .",
    "moreover , we also observe two even narrower absorption features in both na  @xmath10 lines of @xmath0 cas .",
    "the features , with velocities around heliocentric rest velocity , can possibly be attributed to weaker contributions from the local interstellar medium ( lism ) .",
    "the increase of the central emission reversals above the local continuum level results from the decrease of the optical continuum flux with the decrease of @xmath18 during the outburst .",
    "the flux of the central emission is therefore independent of the photospheric conditions , indicating that na  @xmath10 emission emerges from an extended gas envelope around the hypergiant .",
    "we observe that the deep absorption portions of the na  @xmath10 lines do not reveal significant doppler shifts during the outburst , similar as for h@xmath11 .",
    "these static lines are unlike the weaker photospheric absorption spectrum which strongly blue - shifts .",
    "however , it should be remembered that the na  @xmath10 lines are strongly intensity saturated .",
    "the absorption saturation distorts the line shape , which renders the lines useless for radial velocity measurements . on the other hand ,",
    "the violet wings of both lines are excellent indicators for enhanced opacity in an expanding wind .",

    "the spectrum of 2002 january 29 ( jd 2452303 ) is observed around the recent @xmath1-brightness maximum with @xmath18@xmath26 6500 k. the weak tio bands are therefore not detected .",
    "the spectrum also shows that this wavelength region is very close to the stellar continuum level , and does not reveal weak absorptions that could blend with the tio band .",
    "hence , we can use the band at 7069   to reliably estimate the mean gas density in the tio line formation region during the outburst .",
    "the lower panel of figure 12 shows that the tio lines are formed in the selected model atmosphere over a range of optical depths with @xmath193 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath370 ( _ vertical dashed lines _ ) .",
    "deeper in the atmosphere the kinetic temperature @xmath79 ( _ dashed line _ ) increases to above 4000 k , where the tio molecules dissociate in the chemical equilibrium calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "tio molecules do form at @xmath38 @xmath37 @xmath193 , but these outer layers are very optically thin and contribute little to the tio absorption line formation .",
    "the tio line contribution functions assume largest values in this model for 3000  k @xmath37 @xmath79 @xmath37 4000  k , with negligible contributions outside the corresponding gas density regions .",
    "hence , we compute that the density @xmath0 ( _ solid line _ ) in the tio line formation region during outburst ranges between @xmath199.8 @xmath37 @xmath80 @xmath37 @xmath198.5 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the limited range of gas densities , derived from modeling newly formed tio bands , are useful to also estimate the gas mass - loss rate during the eruption .",
    "further tests show that a mean formation density during the outburst is much harder to constrain from modeling atomic absorption lines .",
    "the atomic lines develop strong asymmetries , with very extended blue line wings that form in a fast expanding low - density wind .",
    "the atomic lines thereby form over a much larger density range than the tio bands . to infer",
    "the mass - loss rate from modeling the atomic line profiles would require detailed ( semi - empiric ) time - dependent models of the velocity- and density - structure of the atmosphere during the outburst , which is outside the scope of the present investigation .",
    "based on the outburst spectra we can assume a lower density limit for the tio line formation region of @xmath81 = @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "the distance over which this region expands ( assuming spherical geometry ) is computed from the radial velocity we observe for the tio bands .",
    "the star velocity of @xmath1947 @xmath28 yields a mean velocity for the tio envelope expansion of @xmath1982 + 47 = @xmath1935 @xmath28 .",
    "it corresponds to a travel distance of @xmath84 = 869 @xmath23 ( @xmath162 @xmath22 ) over a period of @xmath16200 d. the latter is the time which elapsed between the maximum and minimum of the radial velocity curve , observed before the deep brightness minimum ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    during the fast expansion the temperature of the outer atmosphere rapidly plummets to below 4000 k , thereby continuously forming tio molecules . the photosphere accelerates to very fast expansion velocities ( @xmath1635 @xmath28 ) , probably causing a circumstellar shock wave . during the brightness",
    "decrease the outer atmosphere expands over about twice the stellar radius .",
    "this corresponds to a total gas mass lifted above @xmath22 of @xmath85=3@xmath4@xmath5 @xmath12 (= 4 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath84 @xmath81 ) during 200 d. we thus compute a mass - loss rate of @xmath2=5.4@xmath4@xmath5 @xmath88 during the eruption .",
    "this value is 587 times larger than the mass - loss rate of 9.2 @xmath4 @xmath21 @xmath6 , derived by lobel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the pulsation phase of 1993 december . for comparison , during the 200 days the hypergiant sheds the same amount of mass it normally would over a period of 3000 years by quiescent pulsation with @xmath2 below @xmath21 @xmath6 .    the value of @xmath2=5.4@xmath4@xmath5 @xmath6 we calculate for the 2000 - 01 outburst is a _ lower limit _ since the lower limit of the density - range and @xmath22=400  @xmath23 are adopted to estimate a spherical mass - loss rate .",
    "we emphasize that the combination of the density- and kinetic temperature - range obtained in 8.1 is required to correctly compute the intensity ratios observed across the newly formed tio bands .",
    "although we utilize a hydrostatic model atmosphere to perform the radiative transport calculation , this combination of density- and kinetic temperature - range , providing the correct relative band intensities , is also required in more realistic dynamic models . during the outburst",
    "the atmosphere likely assumes a very different density structure than that of a hydrostatic model , but the tio fit procedure will require similar mean gas densities and kinetic temperatures in an expanding atmosphere . on the other hand , we should also mention that the geometric position of the tio formation layers , having the required thermal conditions in a hydrostatic model , is very likely different from the location that these layers will assume in a hydrodynamic model .",
    "dynamic models that are more extended than static models ( i.e. with tio opacity at larger atmospheric radii ) , yield larger mass - loss rates in the tio formation region .",
    "this is also the case when using plane - parallel models instead of spherically symmetric models .",
    "the tio bands computed in spherical symmetry yield smaller line depths ( for the same atmospherical model parameters ) , because the light rays that graze the atmosphere escape earlier from a curved model than from a plane - parallel model .",
    "the best fit calculated with spherical geometry hence requires larger gas densities in the tio formation region than for a plane - parallel model , assuming that the mean optical depth is not appreciably different for both types of models .",
    "the latter assumption is justified here because the best fit indicates that the optical depth of the weak tio bands is large ( @xmath193@xmath89@xmath90@xmath890 ) , or that these bands form at ( sub-)photospheric levels where the bulk of the atomic line spectrum emerges .",
    "larger differences are expected toward smaller optical depths with @xmath90@xmath89@xmath193 , where the extended violet wings of the atomic lines are formed in a much faster expanding wind .",
    "best fits to the new tio bands using more extended dynamic and spherical models are therefore expected to provide larger @xmath2-values than the lower limit we estimate from static plane - parallel models .",
    "the present outburst observations , together with the outbursts of 1893 , 1945 - 47 , and 1985 , indicate that the eruptions of @xmath0 cas occur on time - scales of about half a century . for an average mass of 3@xmath4@xmath5 @xmath12 expelled during these events , the star would lose 20 @xmath12 during a period of only 33,750 years ( over 675 outbursts ) . since the current mass of @xmath0 cas is expected not to exceed 40 @xmath12 from evolutionary calculations , and since this time span ( or an order of magnitude longer ) is comparable to the evolutionary life time during the post - red supergiant phase , we infer that the recurrent eruptions , causing punctuated mass - loss episodes , are likely the major mass - loss mechanism for this massive hypergiant .",
    "de jager & nieuwenhuijzen ( 1997 ) suggested that the recurrent eruptions in yellow hypergiants occur when these stars approach the cool boundary of the ` yellow void ' , and bounce off redward .",
    "the evolutionary void is an area in the upper hr - diagram around @xmath18@xmath1610,000  k with @xmath91@xmath205.7 , which is nearly devoid of ( white ) supergiants .",
    "their detailed calculations revealed that hydrostatically stable solutions can not be computed for the atmospheres of _ blueward _ evolving yellow hypergiants at a low boundary of @xmath18@xmath38300  k. the effective acceleration becomes negative , or directed outward , causing an unstable atmosphere above 8300  k. in a review on hypergiants de jager ( 1998 ) suggested that the mechanism for outbursts may be related to increased pulsation velocities during a period of instability when the star , during rapid blueward evolution , increases its pulsation amplitudes .",
    "this ` bouncing against the void ' may explain why most of the cool hypergiants cluster near this low - temperature boundary .",
    "another evolutionary aspect of yellow hypergiants is their possible connection with the s dor variables . in a recent review on these hotter luminous stars ,",
    "van genderen ( 2001 ) addressed the question if fast evolving yellow hypergiants are in fact proto - s dor variables , as proposed by de jager ( 1998 ) .",
    "this can be supported by noting that both types of variables are evolving blueward , and that the void may provide a temporal obstacle at which the unstable atmosphere of the yellow hypergiant is fastly transformed into that of a more stable ( less luminous ) s dor variable .",
    "the void could thus be considered as a stellar atmospherical phenomenon , during rapid blueward evolution , which causes a natural separation between two distinct classes of luminous stars -the luminous blue variables ( lbv ) and the cool hypergiants- with essentially the same , or comparable , evolutionary life - times .",
    "the segregation possibly only occurs during the post - red supergiant phase after a yellow hypergiant , at the cool border of the void , has shed sufficient amounts of mass during recurring phases of punctuated mass - loss ( outbursts ) that quickly strip off its extended atmosphere .",
    "such a scenario for the evolution of massive stars would imply that the instantaneous stellar mass is a fundamental parameter which determines at what point during blueward evolution a yellow hypergiant makes the transit across the void . in other words ,",
    "the bouncing against the void occurs only if the blueward evolutionary track is sufficiently fast to quickly approach the cool border of the void .",
    "less luminous ( i.e. less massive ) yellow hypergiants require more time with quiescent mass - loss before the recurrent outbursts can develop .",
    "it can explain why recurrent outburst have not been observed in many other galactic yellow hypergiants so far , although they bear the spectroscopic signatures of a cool hypergiant .",
    "presumably , @xmath0 cas is therefore one of the most massive known yellow hypergiants , quickly heading to the point of transiting the void .",
    "the above considerations in this section are rather tentative , but it is of note that advanced evolutionary calculations of massive supergiants do adopt average mass - loss rates during the yellow hypergiant phase that are compatible with the observed values of about 20  @xmath12 during 33,750 yr .",
    "the blueward tracks in these simulations ( meynet et al .",
    "1994 ) last for @xmath1649,000 yr with @xmath91=5.33 during this period , and only 6500 yr when @xmath91=5.77 .",
    "in other words , the high mass - loss rates in these calculations yield very short - lived blue loops over which the yellow hypergiants cross the upper portion of the hr - diagram , thereby considerably diminishing the stellar mass , by about halving it .",
    "the recurrent outbursts of @xmath0 cas could therefore be a major cause which quickly transforms the yellow hypergiant into a hotter less massive hypergiant .",
    "we note that mass - loss estimates for the giant and lesser eruptions of the lbv @xmath13 car , by @xmath1650 years apart , of 7 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ( davidson & humphreys 1997 ) are of the same order of magnitude as we observe for the outburst of @xmath0 cas .    to conclude this section , we should point out that cool hypergiants as @xmath0 cas are the prime candidates for progenitors of type ii supernovae ( sn ) .",
    "their actual evolutionary phase remains poorly understood .",
    "the he - core burning phase of cool hypergiants is likely accompanied by tremendous episodic mass - loss events as presented here .",
    "if these stars lose half of the current mass in only a few tens of thousand years , it will lead to an active reconstruction of the stellar interior . lessons from sn 1987a teach that we should monitor , by all possible means , a number of galactic type ii sn progenitor candidates ( such as the cool hypergiants ) , if we aim to understand the relationship between the mass of the progenitor and the mass of the compact sn remnant .",

    ". visual brightness estimates from aavso during the 1946 outburst are also shown in figure 1 of beardsley ( 1961 ) .",
    "the brightness decrease lasted for @xmath16660 d during the entire outburst of 1945 - 47 , with a very steep increase and rather symmetric decrease of @xmath93 in @xmath1 ( gaposchkin 1949 ) .",
    "a lesser brightness decrease was observed during the outburst of 1986 , with a ( visual ) dimming of only @xmath16@xmath94 , and a ( photo - electric ) brightness increase of @xmath3@xmath95 .",
    "this event lasted for 550 d , but with a shallower brightness decrease and increase .",
    "the recent outburst of 2000 - 01 is more pronounced as the previous one , but a remarkable strong brightness maximum precedes the deep minimum in the fall of 2000 .",
    "however , the entire outburst occurred over a much shorter time span of less than 500 d. the phases with the deep brightness minima therefore appear to have considerably shortened over the three outbursts ; from @xmath16400 d in 1946 , to @xmath16200 d in 1986 , to @xmath16100 d in late 2000 ( see also hassforther 2001 ) .",
    "after the deep minimum of 1986 the @xmath1-brightness declined , along with a steady decline of the variability amplitude over time ( see also zsoldos & percy 1991 ) .",
    "the brightness maximum after the deep minimum is followed by three declining brightness cycles , while returning to the mean magnitude level before the outburst .",
    "it signals pulsation phases over which the photosphere ` relaxes ' to the initial conditions .",
    "the outbursts are followed by cycles of decreasing pulsation compression while the atmosphere gradually settles to the star s gravitational potential well by dissipating the excess energy released by the explosion into the circumstellar environment ( possibly somewhat similar to a bouncing ball losing height by friction ) .",
    "the vertical lines in the upper panel of figure 13 mark our high - resolution spectroscopic observations , while spectroscopic observation dates quoted in the literature are marked for the other outbursts in the lower panels .",
    "the dates when tio was observed in the spectrum are connected with a horizontal line and labeled with tio .",
    "popper ( 1947 ) was the first to report the observation of tio bands in the spectrum of 1945 october of @xmath0  cas ( see also keenan 1947 ) , shortly _ before _ the decline in light started .",
    "interestingly , he also mentions that : `` a spectrogram obtained by struve in august , 1944 , before the light had started to fade , shows that the spectroscopic changes were already well underway , although the tio bands had not yet appeared . ''",
    "it is important to point out that the outburst of 1945 - 47 was preceded by a pre - outburst cycle ( jd 2431000 @xmath19 jd 2431600 ) , similar as we observe before the outburst of 2000 - 01 between jd 2451000 and jd 2451600 . during the latter period ,",
    "we do not find indications for tio in the spectra ( _ labeled with numbers 39 @xmath19 63 in the upper panel _ ) , although the spectra observed around the brightness minimum appear to be of a later spectral type ( g@xmath19k ) .",
    "our observations confirm popper s statement that tio is not observed during the pre - outburst cycle of 1944 ( _ labeled ` no tio ' in the lower panel _ ) .",
    "we detect tio bands in the wht - ues spectra of 2000 july and august ( _ nos .",

    "the presence of tio before the deep minimum of 1946 is also stated by beardsley ( 1961 ) . a spectrum obtained by bidelman in 1945 october ,",
    "a short time after the decline to the deep minimum had commenced shows tio bands , although the star was still fairly bright . on the other hand , the wht - ues spectrum of 2001 february 5 ( _ no . 69",
    "_ ) does not contain discernible tio bands . during the four months before this observation the star quickly brightens up by @xmath16@xmath96 , while the expansion velocity of the deeper photosphere strongly decelerates , and begins to collapse during the deep brightness minimum ( _ solid dots connected by the dotted line in upper panel are @xmath35-values from fe  i ; the other solid dots are values from oro _ ) .",
    "the spectra obtained between 2001 february and 2002 february ( _ nos .",
    "69 @xmath1977 _ ) do not show tio bands .",
    "these observations confirm the observations by beardsley ( 1961 ) that tio was no longer present in his spectra observed after 1947 may .",
    "he also mentions that thackeray ( 1948 ) found that in 1947 april ( around jd 2432280 ) , when the star was on the rise to full brightness , the tio bands were still present , although `` almost gone '' .",
    "thackeray ( 1948 ) makes the remarkable statement that by 1947 april the absorption lines resumed their sharp(er ) supergiant character of 1939 ( observed before the outburst by tai & thackeray 1948 ) . by comparing different wavelength portions of the spectrum with @xmath7 cep ( m2 ) and @xmath97 cam ( g1 )",
    "he concludes that : `` the temperature corresponding to the lines spectrum seems to vary from 5500 deg . in the green to 3500 deg . in the red . '' in other words , the outburst spectra of 1945 - 47 and 2000 - 01 show that tio bands occur throughout the period of brightness decline _ and _ the period of rise as well .",
    "these observations show that the deep brightness minimum during the outbursts is not the primary cause for the formation of molecular bands in the spectrum .",
    "they rather indicate that the bands can form when only the upper atmosphere expands beyond a certain threshold velocity .",
    "for example , the tio bands do not form during the pre - outburst cycle of 1999 because the photospheric expansion velocity does not exceed 10  @xmath28 ( with respect to the stellar rest frame ) , while in the summer of 2000 the expansion velocity increases to 18  @xmath28 , and tio is observed .",
    "the molecular bands are produced by rapid cooling of their outer formation region , which results from the unusual fast expansion of the entire atmosphere .",
    "it follows from our observations that the time - scale for the formation of the tio bands is less than 100 d ( between jd 2451650 and jd 2451744 ) .",
    "conversely , the collapse of the deeper photosphere raises the kinetic temperature in the molecular line formation region , which ceases to produce metal - oxides .",
    "the disappearance of these peculiar molecular bands after the deep minimum is not the result of the strong brightness increase only .",
    "greenstein ( 1948 ) and beardsley ( 1961 ) observe alo in spectra of 1947 september and november ( after jd 2432430 ) , when tio was no longer present .",
    "the alo bands also disappear after that time , but they were observed during a period when the stellar brightness had returned to normal levels ( fig . 13 , _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "it confirms that the appearance of newly formed molecules with the outbursts of @xmath0 cas chiefly results from the exceptional dynamics of the atmosphere during these events .",
    "note further that we do not observe alo in the outburst spectra of 2000 - 01 . on the other hand ,",
    "many broad absorption features develop in these complex spectra suggesting newly formed molecular bands , but which however still defy identification .",
    "boyarchuk , boyarchuk , & petrov ( 1988 ) also observe the appearance of the tio band at 5448   ( 7.5 ) in 1986 february ( jd 2446450 in fig .",
    "the band becomes gradually deeper and assumes maximum strength in 1986 may .",
    "it is still present in 1986 july , but disappears completely in 1986 august .",
    "they also monitored h@xmath11 during the shallow brightness minimum ( see their fig .",
    "the high - resolution spectra show that a very strong emission wing is present in the blue h@xmath11 absorption core in 1984",
    "november ( jd 2446000 ) , before the brightness decline .",
    "strong emission in the blue wing of h@xmath11 is also observed during the pre - outburst cycle of 1999 .",
    "they further show that the h@xmath11 absorption core becomes conspicuously weak during the deep brightness minimum of mid 1986 , as we observe during the deep outburst minimum of late 2000 ( 7.2 ) .",
    "note however that these authors do not observe central emission above the continuum in na  @xmath10 , which also confirms a smaller continuum ( hence @xmath18 ) decrease during the event of 1986 . during the minimum of 1946",
    "the broad absorption cores of na  @xmath10 completely vanish , and weak emission lines appear above the continuum level ( fig . 1 of thackeray 1948 ) .",
    "weak h@xmath97 and h@xmath76 lines are observed during the deep minimum , with the presence of core emission in h@xmath11 ( beardsley 1961 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations during the three outbursts of @xmath0 cas in the last century reveal remarkably similar evolutions of the detailed line profiles .",
    "these similarities indicate that the outbursts result from a driving mechanism which produces phases of fast photospheric expansion and rapid decreases of @xmath18 , which causes a substantial cooling of the outer atmosphere . in the next section",

    "in a study of atmospheric dynamic instability of red supergiants paczynski & ziolkowski ( 1968 ) were the first to simulate the ejection of a stellar envelope as a possible formation mechanism of planetary nebulae .",

    "the total energy of the envelope becomes positive or unbound when recombination of the ionized hydrogen and helium is taken into account .",

    "sack , & barkat ( 1978 ) found that the envelope becomes dynamically unstable , and mass is being expelled as a series of short - time events .",
    "the mass - loss process results from repetitive shock ejections , where the red giant loses about 3% of its prevailing envelope per ejection . during the event the mean envelope density decreases by an order of magnitude , and the region with @xmath98@xmath894/3 displaces toward the deeper mass layers with the release of recombination energy ( _ see their figs . 3 & 4 _ ) .",

    "we demonstrate first that pure thermal expansion of an ideal hydrogen gas can not provide sufficient energy to accelerate the atmosphere to an outburst .",
    "this results from the conservation of total energy .",
    "consider a gas element with flow velocity @xmath101 at a distance @xmath102 in the atmosphere .",
    "the total energy of this element per unit mass is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is specific internal energy ( expressed per unit mass ) , @xmath63 the local gas pressure , and @xmath0 the mass density . for the specific internal energy of an ideal gas @xmath105 , due to the translational motion of the gas particles in the parcel , with an equation of state @xmath106 , the differential of equation ( 4 ) yields @xmath107 where @xmath68 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath108 the number of particles per unit mass , and @xmath109 the atmospheric gravity acceleration ( at @xmath102=@xmath22 ) .",
    "equation ( 5 ) provides an estimate of the acceleration of the gas element due to the change of the local temperature , assuming that its total energy per unit mass remains constant .",

    "we investigate the ionization - recombination driving mechanism of @xmath0 cas outburst with a more detailed numerical calculation .",
    "we show that the observed time - scale , and the expansion velocity of the outburst can be well predicted from an adiabatic hydrostatic calculation in spherical geometry .",
    "we emphasize however that this discussion does not involve a detailed solution of the momentum equation to compute the time - evolution of the dynamic and thermal wind structure .",
    "the presented calculations rather consider the driving properties of different atmospheric layers , that result from the conservation of total energy and mechanical flow momentum at different temperatures .",
    "the full hydrodynamic treatment of the outburst would require a time- _ and _ temperature - dependent solution of the conservation equations .",
    "this would demand , however , the detailed knowledge of the physical mechanism by which ionization - recombination energy is converted into wind momentum ( possibly due to electron scattering ) , besides the adiabatic expansion of the atmosphere .",
    "the driving mechanism is opacity dependent , which therefore also depends on the local gas temperature and density .",
    "consequently , the atmospheric opacity also determines the detailed cooling properties during the outburst . with hydrogen recombination",
    "the ( electron ) opacity falls rapidly , thereby diminishing the driving force by the free flow of radiation .",
    "we also emphasize that the calculations do not consider radiative damping , or that we neglect possible radiation loss terms in the energy balance equation .",
    "this approximation assumes that the energy released by the recombining gas elements is entirely converted into flow momentum which drives an expansion . in this respect ,",
    "we adopt a ` fully optically thick ' limit to evaluate the energy and momentum balance of the outflow , and demonstrate that this assumption provides good agreement with the observations .",
    "the amount of radiative damping can possibly be determined by modeling the h@xmath11 line profile , to determine its optical thickness and the energy in the emission of the transition .",
    "the radiative losses are dependent on the atmospheric opacity , which includes the density dependent electron opacity .",

    "we assume that the total energy of every gas ( mass ) element at temperature @xmath79 in the expanding atmosphere is constant and given by equation ( 4 ) , with the material gas pressure @xmath114 .",

    "an increase ( decrease ) of the momentum displaces the region of fast acceleration toward higher ( lower ) temperatures , but the width of the temperature range remains unaltered .",

    "we therefore conclude that the close correspondence of @xmath149 with the observed time - scale of @xmath16200 d , over which @xmath18 decreases from 7250  k to @xmath374000 k , indicates a quasi - adiabatic spherical expansion of the entire upper atmosphere during the outburst , driven by the release of hydrogen ionization energy due to complete recombination . after the outburst the value of @xmath98 increases to above 4/3 in the region where @xmath151 is maximum , and",
    "hence the inflated atmosphere becomes dynamically stable ( _ long dashed line in upper panel _ ) .      from the considerations in the previous section we derive a more general equation for the time - scale of recombination - driven stellar outbursts .",
    "since the maximum expansion velocity occurs in the partial ionization layers of the pre - outburst atmosphere where @xmath124@xmath30.5 , the adiabatic outburst velocity , due to complete recombination to @xmath113@xmath30 in this region , is approximated with equation ( 7 ) : @xmath152 where @xmath31 is the energy of the recombining ionization stage of the driving element under consideration .",
    "hence , for @xmath151@xmath3@xmath191/2 , with a temperature change of @xmath153 in layers of @xmath123 , equation ( 12 ) casts to : @xmath154 the adiabatic index of volume expansion in the partial ionization region with @xmath124@xmath30.5 simplifies with equation ( 10 ) to @xmath155 the outburst time ( over which @xmath18 decreases by @xmath19@xmath156 ) , driven by the recombining atmospheric region around @xmath123 , is obtained with equations ( 11 ) , ( 13 ) , and ( 14 ) @xmath157 where we denote @xmath158=@xmath159 .",
    "the first two factors at the r.h.s . of equation ( 15 )",

    "however , for pulsating supergiants with hydrogen deficient atmospheres , for which outbursts can be driven by the first recombination of helium , equation ( 15 ) predicts much shorter time - scales .",
    "for example , for r crb , a ib - supergiant with @xmath18@xmath36900  k and @xmath22=80  @xmath23 , we compute for @xmath123=13,000 k in the first helium recombination zone ( @xmath162=24.58 ev and @xmath163=21.9 ) an outburst time of 39 d for @xmath156=@xmath193500 k. this time - scale corresponds to the brightness declines by 3@xmath196 mag . observed in r crb - type variables , which occur in less than 50 d ( clayton 1996 ) . in these smaller stars the outbursts occur faster and more violently than in the hypergiants .",
    "the burst - time also depends on the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium , whereas equation ( 15 ) assumes a pure hydrogen ( or helium ) atmosphere . for gas mixtures ,",
    "the last factor of equation ( 15 ) requires the multi - component expressions of 1/(@xmath131@xmath191 ) , computed in lobel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for solar abundance values ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) . in the first ionization zone of helium with @xmath123=13,000",

    "note that for @xmath0 cas we compute that the outburst extends the atmosphere with @xmath101=36 @xmath28 over @xmath165=@xmath166=988 @xmath23 ( @xmath32.5 @xmath22 ) , while for r crb the equation predicts that @xmath101=48  @xmath28 and @xmath165=235 @xmath23 ( @xmath32.9 @xmath22 ) .",
    "in a study of stellar outburst mechanisms , sedov ( 1958 ) obtained time - dependent solutions for the propagation of a spherically expanding shock wave in a gravity field .",
    "analytic solutions are provided in which the energy of the shock motion remains equal at any time to the initial energy in the equilibrium state of the unperturbed atmosphere .",
    "he derived a simple analytic solution in cases of a constant specific heat ratio @xmath76=@xmath167=7/6 , and showed that the radial velocity of the shock decreases monotonically with @xmath168=const@xmath4@xmath169 .",
    "the equations can also be applied to the extended partial hydrogen ionization zone in the upper atmosphere of @xmath0 cas with @xmath76@xmath894/3 before the outburst .",
    "this zone provides mechanical shock energy by hydrogen recombination to drive the outburst , with the conservation of total energy .",
    "since the adiabatic expansion velocities computed for the outburst ( and observed also ) of @xmath0 cas exceed the adiabatic sound speed ( @xmath170=@xmath171=5@xmath1913 @xmath28 ) , we propose the formation of a circumstellar shock wave that surpasses the gravitational pull of the supergiant , carrying momentum beyond the sonic point into the circumstellar environment .",
    "the disrupted and inflated atmosphere reaches a state of reduced total energy , and adapts to this energy dissipation by contracting globally .",
    "hydrogen recombination driving thus provides a limit to the mechanical energy which can be released by this thermal outburst mechanism , and may explain why comparable atmospheric changes have occurred during the three outbursts of @xmath0 cas in the last century ; for example , the formation of tio in outer layers with @xmath79@xmath894000 k , and the decrease of @xmath1-brightness by @xmath37@xmath93 , for total outburst times of 500 to 660 d.    we think that the outburst results from a synchronization phenomenon whereby ionization - recombination energy is released upon decompression , in a global cooling of the entire atmosphere .",
    "the increase of outflow momentum causes an outward acceleration by which the atmosphere further cools , thereby reinforcing the release of more ionization energy .",
    "the cooling and recombination rates synchronize , which causes a fast escalation of ionization energy release into atmospheric expansion toward the deeper layers that contain more ionization energy .",
    "this unleashes even more energy , and hence produces an explosive runaway event .",
    "the condition for an outburst is therefore strongly dependent of the overall temperature- and density - structure during the atmospheric compression phase that leads up to the eruption .",
    "the atmospheric dimensions determine whether the recombination rate ( and hence the wind acceleration ) can keep up with the cooling rate , and this in turn determines whether a ` disruption ' front , or a strong expansion shock wave , can move down the atmosphere , and consume most of its ionization energy .",
    "the full time - dependent solution of the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic equations will therefore also require the proper treatment of the detailed physics of strong shock waves in partially ionizing gas , with variable gammas across the shock surface .",
    "it is known that the ionization of hydrogen due to the compression by strong shock waves can store 5 to 6 times more energy in ionization energy than the amount that is available in the translational motion of particles of the shocked gas ( lobel 1997 , p. 80 ) .",
    "note that partial thermal ionization can raise the compressibility of the shocked gas , whereby the density jump ratio across a compression front can increase to very high values of @xmath1620 .",
    "however , the density jump ratio is limited to a maximum value of only 4 in cases of ideal gas , for which partial ionization is neglected .",
    "the ionization - recombination instability requires a ` trigger ' that provides the precise atmospheric structure to this cascade of energy release .",
    "the outburst of @xmath0 cas is preceded by a conspicuously long period between 1993 and 1997 over which the stellar wind practically vanishes .",
    "the wind acceleration appears to stall ( observed from the disappearance of violet extended wings in the photospheric lines ) , while the ( photospheric ) radial velocity increases by 30 @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "the @xmath35-curve , shows four quasi - periodic oscillations , with @xmath18-changes of 500 to 800  k during the pulsation cycles . after that time the atmosphere expands rapidly , with the strong @xmath1-brightness decrease of the pre - outburst cycle .",
    "it signals the sudden release of flow momentum that has accumulated in the atmosphere over the four preceding years , for example in a denser mass shell that has been swept up in the atmosphere by a subsonic wind .    during the large oscillation preceding the actual outburst , the atmosphere decompresses and cools , thereby changing its thermodynamic structure , so that the next phase of compression can effectively convert the kinetic energy from a ballistic supersonic downfall ( by @xmath1613 @xmath28 ) into ionization energy .",
    "the atmosphere therefore strongly collapses , becoming denser and warmer , while partly storing this kinetic energy into ionization energy .",
    "what follows is a phase of unusual high @xmath18@xmath16 8000 k. cool supergiant atmospheres become very compressible ( or expandable ) around @xmath18=7000@xmath198000 k by the decrease of @xmath98 , which is related to the atmospheric elasticity ( or bulk modulus ) , to below the stability value of 4/3 over a large geometric fraction .",
    "lobel ( 2001 ) shows ( see fig .",
    "6 ) that these atmospheres can even assume @xmath98-values below unity for @xmath150@xmath370 , due to partial lte- and non - lte - ionization of hydrogen . for these atmospheric conditions the volume - averaged @xmath89@xmath98@xmath26 assumes values below 4/3 down to the base of the atmosphere , beyond the hydrogen and helium ionization zones .",
    "local mechanic perturbations , i.e. gas rarefactions , then become not sufficiently balanced by the counterworking thermodynamic forces .",
    "the latter rather enhance the rarefactions and release more recombination energy , which causes their displacements @xmath172@xmath102/@xmath102 from hydrostatic equilibrium to grow exponentially with time .    for the conditions of supergiant atmospheres with @xmath18=7000@xmath198000",
    "k , the atmospheric structure is very dynamically unstable , and tuned so that a self - sustained hydrodynamic - thermal avalanche can occur .",
    "the entire atmosphere rapidly de - ionizes and expands from the top to the very bottom , while driving an accelerating wind .",
    "this mechanism is time - critical and comes to a halt only when most of the atmospheric ionization energy has been released by the outburst , and @xmath89@xmath98@xmath26 returns to above 4/3 in the outer atmosphere .",
    "the atmosphere cools down to below @xmath18=4500 k with the fast expansion , whereby the upper layers with @xmath173 @xmath89 4000  k form tio bands that characterize the spectra of m - type stars .",
    "the outburst trigger can be compared to lifting a heavy hammer over a long period of time , that suddenly drops and hits a lighter rubber ball on the floor .",
    "the ball jumps up very high because its elasticity conserves linear momentum . for the outburst of @xmath0 cas , thermal",
    "ionization - recombination ensures that the high compressibility of the atmosphere ` bounces back ' in a resonant amplification of a superwind that further cools and releases more energy from the decompressing ionization reservoir .",
    "think of it as if the ball bounced hard enough to also release internal chemical energy , giving it an additional kick ( e.g. jump higher on a trampoline by timely bending and stretching your legs ) . in a study of gravitational collapse of stellar cores , which can eject the stellar envelope in a supernova - like explosion , bruenn , arnett , & schramm ( 1977 ) compute that the kinetic energy for a reflected shock wave is maximized when a large inward acceleration is rapidly changed to large outward acceleration during the bounce .",
    "they suggest that this is accomplished with an adiabatic index below 4/3 , that goes suddenly well above 4/3 .",
    "arnett & livne ( 1994 ) calculate that when the first adiabatic index is only slightly above 4/3 , the released ( here thermo - nuclear ) energy will drive a pulsation with large amplitude .    the conversion of ionization - recombination energy into expansion energy may also explain why the outbursts of @xmath0 cas are rather sporadic .",
    "the progressive built - up of momentum in the atmosphere by a stalled wind over a long period of time , which can trigger the coherent gravitational collapse , is frequently disrupted by the usual quasi - periodic oscillations of the atmosphere .",
    "ordered atmospheric oscillations effectively transport momentum upward which inhibits activation of the trigger , and does not allow sufficient momentum to built up ( e.g. @xmath18 above 7250 k has previously not been reported for @xmath0 cas ) .",
    "this occurs most of the time , but occasionally the quiescent pulsations become very disordered ( or incoherent ) due to the weak force of gravity and the enormous atmospheric extension ( lobel et al .",
    "1994 ; e.g. soker & harpaz 1992 examine the location of the ` transition region ' relative to the ionization zones which determines if non - radial pulsation modes are excited in agb stars ) .",
    "because these random modes cease to effectively convey pulsation momentum upward , the stellar wind driving vanishes , and the piston momentum becomes temporarily stored in the atmosphere .",
    "if momentum can accumulate over a period of more than four pulsation cycles ( four years say ) , a subsequent average radial pulsation is proceded by very high atmospheric compression , which produces the required thermal conditions of @xmath89@xmath98@xmath26 @xmath89 4/3 , that yield the ionization - recombination driven runaway .",
    "the outburst occurs when the atmospheric cooling rate synchronizes with the displacement of the driving recombination front toward the deeper atmosphere . in these low - gravity atmospheres",
    "the recombination acceleration is almost independent of @xmath109 ( e.g. figure 1 is computed for @xmath109=0 ) .",
    "the latter of course determines the magnitude of the expansion velocity during the outburst , and whether the effective atmospheric acceleration @xmath174 becomes negative ( nieuwenhuijzen & de jager 1995 ) .",
    "an inward directed @xmath174 over a long period of time plays a crucial role for the initial built - up of momentum , and a subsequent activation of the trigger .",
    "outbursts that are initiated by a similar trigger mechanism are therefore expected in other pulsating stars that assume comparable thermal conditions at the base of the atmosphere as @xmath0 cas .",
    "it is interesting to note that the time - scale over which the total ionization - recombination energy , released into the circumstellar environment by the outburst ( assuming complete hydrogen recombination ) , is dissipated by the stellar radiation field over a period following the fast envelope expansion of @xmath175 where @xmath40 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . for an atmospheric expansion of @xmath84 = 869 @xmath23 during outburst , and an envelope density of @xmath176 = @xmath82 @xmath177 ( determined from tio bands in 8.2 ) , we compute with equation ( 16 ) that @xmath178@xmath386  d for @xmath18=3500 k.",
    "this time corresponds very well to the period over which the deep brightness minimum of @xmath16100 d was observed in late 2000 .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring of the yellow hypergiant @xmath0 cas with high - resolution over the past 8.5 years reveals a strong correlation between the radial velocity curve and the @xmath1-magnitude variations .",
    "the latter lag the photospheric oscillations by @xmath16100 d. between 1994 and 1997 the entire upper and lower atmosphere collapses , resulting in the pre - outburst cycle of 1999 , when a very large brightness maximum of @xmath1@xmath16@xmath34 is assumed . during the @xmath1-maximum",
    ", the photosphere expands unusually fast , and @xmath1 subsequently dims by @xmath32@xmath19@xmath33 to the very deep outburst minimum during @xmath16100 d in late 2000 .",
    "the profile shape and velocity variations observed in selected optical fe  i lines , formed in the stellar photosphere , occur on markedly shorter time - scales of @xmath16300 d than the changes of h@xmath11 .",
    "it signals a strongly velocity - stratified pulsating atmosphere .",
    "the outburst is preceded by a variability phase whereby enhanced absorption develops in the long - wavelength wing of h@xmath11 , together with a conspicuously strong short - wavelength emission . during the outburst",
    "the h@xmath11 absorption core becomes very weak and develops satellite emission lines .",
    "it indicates that the line is filled in by emission due to recombination of hydrogen with the global cooling of the atmosphere by @xmath163000 k. the equivalent width variations of the fe  i @xmath255572 line reveal that the @xmath18-changes are limited to @xmath16500@xmath19800  k during the quiescent pulsation phases .",
    "spectral synthesis calculations reveal however that @xmath18 decreases from @xmath207250  k to @xmath374250 k during the outburst .",
    "\\3 . during the outburst the optical absorption spectrum",
    "strongly blue - shifts , and resembles the spectra of the early m - type supergiants betelgeuse and @xmath7 cep .",
    "central emission appears above the continuum level in the split na  @xmath10 lines with the decrease of the optical continuum flux .",
    "the hypergiant is surrounded by a tenuous gas envelope producing permanent line emission in these broad resonance lines , and in forbidden optical [ ca  ii ] lines .",
    "prominent permitted emission lines of neutral metals appear above the local continuum level during exceptional pulsation phases when @xmath18 is large , and the photosphere rapidly begins to expand .",
    "it indicates that the peculiar emission lines are excited by the supersonic stellar wind . on the other hand , high - resolution observations",
    "do not reveal central emission in the broad ca  ii h & k lines , indicating the absence of a ( classic ) permanent chromosphere in the hypergiant .",
    "most remarkably , weak electronic tio bands develop in the summer of 2000 before the @xmath1-brightness minimum .",
    "detailed spectral synthesis calculations show that the bands form over atmospheric regions with 3000  k @xmath37 @xmath79 @xmath37 4000  k and @xmath199.8 @xmath37 @xmath80 @xmath37 @xmath198.5 , and assume an expansion velocity of 35  @xmath28 .",
    "these molecular bands develop within @xmath16100  d after fast outward acceleration , due to the rapid decline of the kinetic temperature in the line formation region . during the outburst",
    ", the tio envelope expands faster than the photosphere , with the photospheric expansion determined from the radial velocity of the atomic absorption line spectrum .",
    "we compute an exceptionally large mass - loss rate of @xmath2=5.4@xmath4@xmath5  @xmath6 for spherical expansion of the tio envelope with a minimum density of @xmath81=@xmath82 gr  @xmath62 at @xmath22=400  @xmath23 .",
    "the cool gas shell expands to @xmath162.5  @xmath22 during an outburst period of @xmath16200 d. the large mass - loss rate indicates that the recurrent outbursts of @xmath0 cas , about every half a century , are the main mass - loss mechanism of this cool star in the post - red supergiant evolutionary phase .    \\6 . within half a year after the deep brightness minimum @xmath18 increases to @xmath35750  k , and",
    "the peculiar tio bands vanish .",
    "optical and near - ir tio bands were also observed during the previous outbursts of @xmath0 cas in 1986 and 1946 , when the star dimmed and brightened up over comparable time - scales .",
    "tio is also observed before the deep brightness minimum of 1946 , indicating that the tio formation is dependent on the atmospheric expansion velocity , which is largest before the deep minimum .",
    "strong emission in the short - wavelength wing of h@xmath11 is also observed before the outburst of 1986 , indicating that the wind dynamics in the outer atmospheric envelope plays a crucial role for an activation of the trigger that causes the outbursts of @xmath0 cas .",
    "we compute that the outburst mechanism can be driven by the release of ionization energy due to the recombination of hydrogen as the atmosphere cools .",
    "when @xmath18 increases to @xmath207250 k , the supergiant atmosphere becomes dynamically unstable because the first generalized adiabatic index @xmath98 decreases to below 4/3 in the partial ionization zone of hydrogen .",
    "atmospheric expansion in this region becomes further amplified with the adiabatic cooling and the release of more driving energy by hydrogen recombination , until @xmath18@xmath373750  k and @xmath98 increases above 4/3 .",
    "the activation of the trigger therefore requires a phase of exceptionally high @xmath18 before the outburst , which can result from enhanced global atmospheric compression during a cycle of strong coherent pulsation in the pre - outburst cycle of 1999 .",
    "based on these simple considerations we derive an equation that correctly predicts the time - scale for the rapid brightness decrease in terms of observable stellar parameters @xmath22 , @xmath18 , the change of @xmath18 , and the ionization energy of the recombining element under consideration .    this research was supported in part through grant number go-5409.02 - 93a to the smithsonian astrophysical observatory from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the aura , under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
