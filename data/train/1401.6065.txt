    "( for more on the cutoff phenomenon , discovered in the early 80 s by aldous and diaconis , see  @xcite . )      our first main result confirms the above conjecture by peres that glauber dynamics for the ising model on @xmath17 , in _ any _ dimension @xmath18 , exhibits cutoff in the full high temperature regime @xmath19 .",

    "the traditional approach for obtaining sharp mixing results for the ising model has been two - fold : one would first derive certain properties of the stationary ising measure ( ranging from as fundamental as strong spatial mixing to as proprietary as interface fluctuations under specific boundary conditions ) ; these static properties would then drive a dynamical multi - scaled analysis ( e.g. , recursion via block - dynamics / censoring ) ; see  @xcite .",
    "we propose to analyze the spatial and temporal aspects of the glauber dynamics simultaneously by tracking the update process for the ising model on @xmath0 in the @xmath73-dimensional space - time slab .",
    "following is an outline of the approach for heat - bath dynamics ; formal definitions of the framework ( which is valid for a class of glauber dynamics that also includes , e.g. , metropolis ) will be given in   [ sec : framework ] .    as a first step ,",
    "we wish to formulate the dynamics @xmath74 so that the update process , viewed backward in time , would behave as subcritical percolation in @xmath75 ; crucially , establishing this subcritical behavior will build on the classical fact that the site magnetization @xmath26 ( defined in  ) , decays exponentially fast to 0 ( the proof of which uses the monotonicity of the ising model ; see lemma  [ l : basicestimates ] ) .",
    "recall that each site of @xmath0 is updated via a poisson point process , whereby every update utilizes an independent unit variable to dictate the new spin , and the probability of both plus and minus is bounded away from 0 for any fixed @xmath47 even when all neighbors have the opposing spin .",
    "hence , we can say that with probability @xmath76 bounded away from 0 ( explicitly given in  ) , the site is updated to a @xmath77 fair coin flip independently of the spins at its neighbors , to be referred to as an _",
    "oblivious update_.      for simplicity , we first give a basic definition that will be useful only for small @xmath5 .",
    "going backward in time from a given site @xmath78 at time @xmath43 , we reveal the _ update history _ affecting @xmath79 : in case of an oblivious update we `` kill '' the branch , and otherwise we split it into its neighbors , continuing until all sites die out or reach time 0 ( see figure  [ fig : clusters - t25 ] ) .",
    "the final cluster then allows one to recover @xmath80 given the unit variables for the updates and the intersections of the cluster with the initial state @xmath14 .",
    "note that the dependencies in the ising measure show up in this procedure when update histories of different sites at time @xmath43 merge into a single cluster , turning the spins at time @xmath43 into a complicated function of the update variables and the initial state .",
    "of course , since the probability of an oblivious update @xmath81 goes to @xmath82 as @xmath83 , for a small enough @xmath5 the aforementioned branching process is indeed subcritical , and so these clusters should have an exponential tail ( see figure  [ fig : clusters - all ] ) . for @xmath5 close to the critical point in lattices , this is no longer the case , and one needs to refine the definition of an information percolation cluster  roughly , it is the subset of the update history that the designated spin truly depends on ( e.g. , in the original procedure above , an update can cause the function determining @xmath79 to become independent of another site in the cluster , whence the latter is removed without being directly updated ) .",
    "the motivation behind studying these clusters is the following .",
    "picture a typical cluster as a single strand , linking between `` sausages '' of branches that split and quickly dye out .",
    "if this strand dies before reaching time 0 then the spin atop would be uniform , and otherwise , starting e.g.  from all - plus , that spin would be plus .",
    "therefore , our definition of the cutoff time @xmath27 has that about @xmath84 of the sites reach time 0 ; in this way , most sites are independent of the initial state , and so @xmath85 would be well mixed . further seen now is the role of the initial state @xmath14 , opening the door to non - worst - case analysis : one can analyze the distribution of the spins atop a cluster in terms of its intersection with @xmath14 at time @xmath86 .      to quantify the above",
    ", we classify the clusters into three types : informally ,    a cluster is blue  if it dies out very quickly both in space and in time ;    a cluster is red  if the initial state affects the spins atop ;    a cluster is green  in all other situations .",
    "( see  [ sec : framework ] for formal definitions , and figure  [ fig : clusters-1d ] for an illustration of these for the ising model on @xmath87 . )",
    "once we condition on the green clusters ( to be thought of as having a negligible effect on mixing ) , what remains is a competition between red clusters  embodying the dependence on the initial state @xmath14  and blue ones , the projection on which is just a product measure ( independent of @xmath14 ) .",
    "then , one wants to establish that red clusters are uncommon and `` lost within a sea of blue clusters '' .",
    "this is achieved via a simple yet insightful lemma of miller and peres  @xcite , bounding the total - variation distance in terms of a certain exponential moment ; in our case , an exponential of the intersection of the set of vertices in red  clusters between two i.i.d .  instances of the dynamics . our main task",
    " naturally becoming increasingly more delicate as @xmath5 approaches @xmath6  will be to bound this exponential moment , by showing that each red set behaves essentially as a uniformly chosen subset of size @xmath88 at time @xmath89 ; thus , the exponential moment will approach 1 as @xmath90 , implying mixing .",
    "adaptations of the general framework above can be used in different settings :    to tackle arbitrary graphs at high enough temperatures ( theorem  [ mainthm - gen ] ) , a blue cluster is one that dies out before reaching the bottom ( time 0 ) and has a singleton spin at the top ( the target time @xmath43 ) , and a red cluster is one where the spins at the top have a nontrivial dependence on the initial state @xmath14 .    for lattices at any @xmath19",
    ", the branching processes encountered are not sufficiently subcritical , and one needs to boost them via a phase in which ( roughly ) some of the oblivious updates are deferred , only to be sprinkled at the end of the analysis .",
    "this entails a more complicated definition of blue clusters , referring to whether history dies out quickly enough from the end of that special phase , whereas red clusters remain defined as ones where the top spins are affected by the initial state @xmath14 .    for random initial states ( theorem  [ mainthm - z - ann - que ] ) we define a red cluster as one",
    "in which the intersection with @xmath14 is of size at least 2 and coalesces to a single point _ before _",
    "time 0 under _ coupling from the past_. the fact that pairs of sites surviving to time 0 are now the dominant term ( as opposed to singletons ) explains the factor of 2 between the annealed / worst - case settings ( cf .",
    "the two parts of theorem  [ mainthm - z - ann - que ] ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : framework ] we give the formal definitions of the above described framework , while  [ sec : lattice - framework ] contains the modification of the general framework tailored to lattices up to the critical point , including three lemmas analyzing the information percolation clusters . in   [ sec : inf - perc ] we prove the cutoff results in theorems  [ mainthm - zd ] and  [ mainthm - zd - external - field ] modulo these technical lemmas , which are subsequently proved in   [ sec : cluster - analysis ] . the final section ,  [ sec : ann - que ] , is devoted to the analysis of non - worst - case initial states ( random vs.  deterministic , annealed vs.  quenched ) and the proof of theorem  [ mainthm - z - ann - que ] .",
