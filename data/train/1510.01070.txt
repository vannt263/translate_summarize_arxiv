    "technological improvements in the field of digital cameras are strongly simplifying the study of collective behavior in animal groups .",
    "the use of single or multi - camera systems to record the time evolution of a group is by far the most common tool to understand collective motion .",
    "the emergence of collective behavior in human crowds @xcite , fish schools @xcite , bird flocks @xcite and insect swarms @xcite have been investigated .",
    "events of interest are recorded from one or more cameras and images are then processed to reconstruct the trajectory of each individual in the group .",
    "positions of single individuals at each instant of time are used to characterize the system .",
    "density , mean velocity , mean acceleration , size of the group , as well as single velocities and accelerations are computed to understand how collective behavior arises and following which rules .",
    "the reliability of these results is strictly connected to the accuracy of the reconstructed trajectories .    in a previous work cavagna",
    "et al . in @xcite suggested how to reduce the error on the retrieved trajectories choosing the proper set up for the system .",
    "more recently in @xcite , a tool to check the accuracy of a multicamera system on the reconstructed trajectories is provided , together with a software for the calibration of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters . in @xcite ,",
    "towne et al . give a way to measure the reconstruction error and to quantify it when a dlt technique is used to calibrate the extrinsic parameters of the system .",
    "but a theoretical discussion on the propagation of the errors from experimental measures to the reconstructed positions and trajectories is still missing .    from a collective behavior perspective , distances between targets are much more interesting than absolute positions .",
    "indeed , quantities like density , velocity , acceleration are not referred to the position of single animals , but they involve a measure of a distance . for this reason , in our discussion we will show how to estimate the error on the reconstructed @xmath0 position of a single target , but we will give more emphasis to the error on mutual distances between two targets . we will focus the analysis on how experimental measurements and calibration uncertainty affect mutual distances between targets and we will give some suggestions on how to choose a suitable set up in order to achieve the desired and acceptable error .    in the first section of the paper we give a description of the pinhole model , which is by far the simplest but effective approximation of a digital camera .",
    "we introduce the nomenclature used in the entire paper .",
    "moreover we describe the mathematical relations holding between the position of a target in the three dimensional real world and the position of its image on the camera sensor . in the same section",
    ", we describe the general principles of the @xmath0 reconstruction making use of systems of two pinhole cameras . in the second section",
    "we will show the error formulation for both absolute position of a single target and mutual distance between pair of targets considering at first one camera only , and then generalizing the results to the case of a camera system . in the third section",
    "we give an interpretation of the error formulation to suggest how the reconstruction error can be reduced by properly choosing the suitable intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the system . in the fourth and last section we consider the set up we use in the field to record starling flocks and midge swarms .",
    "we give a description on the tests we perform to check the accuracy of the retrieved trajectories .",
    "moreover we practically show how the results of these tests are affected by experimental measurements inaccuracy .",
    "the reconstruction of the position of a target imaged by one or more camera can be intuitively address with a geometric perspective . in some special situations , the images of only one camera",
    "gives enough information to determine where the target is located in the real world .",
    "however in the general case at least two cameras are needed .    in this section",
    "we address the geometric formulation of the @xmath0 reconstruction problem for one camera and for a system of two cameras , knowing intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the system .",
    "intrinsic parameters fix the geometry of the camera and its lens : the position of the image center , the focal length and the distortion coefficients .",
    "we calibrate the intrinsic parameters taking into account the radial distortion up to the first order coefficient only , while we do not consider tangential distortion .",
    "tests presented in section  [ section::test ] show that this is sufficient to obtain the desired accuracy in the @xmath0 reconstruction .",
    "extrinsic parameters , instead , describe the position and orientation of the camera system with respect to a world reference frame .",
    "they generally include a set of angles , fixing the orientation of the cameras and a set of length measures expressed in meters defining the cameras positions .",
    "depending on the experiment they can be practically measured with high precision instruments or calibrated through software tools . in the paper , we consider cameras in the pinhole approximation , which is the easiest but effective camera model .",
    "note that the pinhole approximation does not take into account lens distortion . in the following",
    "when talking about the position of a target on the image plane , we will always refer to its coordinates already undistorted .",
    "coordinate of a @xmath0 target @xmath1 and the @xmath2 coordinate of its image @xmath3 by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "similarity between the two dashed and filled green triangles shows instead the proportionality between the @xmath5 coordinate of the point @xmath1 and the @xmath6 coordinate of its image . *",
    "b : * the two targets @xmath7 and @xmath8 lying on the same @xmath9-plane are imaged in @xmath10 and @xmath11 . similarity between the two dashed and filled orange triangles shows that the distance @xmath12 is proportional to the @xmath13 distance @xmath14 through the coefficient @xmath4 . ]",
    "a camera maps the three dimensional real world into the two dimensional space of its image . in the pinhole approximation",
    "the correspondence between the @xmath0 space and the @xmath13 image plane is defined as a central projection with center in the focal point @xmath15 , see fig.[fig : pinhole_model]a .",
    "the image plane is located at a distance @xmath16 from the focal point @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the focal length of the lens coupled with the camera . under the pinhole camera model , a point @xmath1 in the three dimensional world",
    "is mapped to the point @xmath3 on the image plane belonging to the line connecting @xmath15 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that in this approximation the image plane is located in front of the focal point .",
    "thus the resulting image on the sensor does not reproduce the scene rotated of @xmath17 as it would be in a real camera .",
    "we choose this representation for its simplicity and because it does not affect in any way the discussion of the present paper .",
    "the natural @xmath0 reference frame for a camera in the pinhole approximation is the one having the origin in the focal point @xmath15 , @xmath9-axis coincident with the optical axis of the camera and the @xmath18-plane parallel to the sensor , as shown in fig.[fig : pinhole_model]a .",
    "coordinates in this reference frame are expressed in meters , while coordinates of a point belonging to the sensor plane are usually expressed in pixels .",
    "the size of a single pixel , @xmath19 , defines the correspondence between the two units of measurements .",
    "thus the point @xmath3 belonging to the image plane and such that @xmath20 in the @xmath0 pinhole reference frame corresponds to @xmath21 in the sensor reference frame , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will assume to deal with sensor made of squared pixels , i.e. @xmath24 so that the conversion factor from meters to pixel is the same in both the direction @xmath25 and @xmath5 .",
    "from now on , we denote the coordinates expressed in meters by @xmath25 , @xmath5 and @xmath9 , and the coordinate expressed in pixels by @xmath2 , @xmath6 while @xmath26 represents the focal length @xmath16 expressed in pixels .      as shown in fig.[fig : pinhole_model]b , target @xmath28 in the real world is projected into a point @xmath29 on the image plane . using similarity between triangles",
    "it can be shown that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the correspondence between the @xmath0 real space and the @xmath13 image plane is then defined as : @xmath32 or equivalently : @xmath33 thus , knowing the @xmath0 position of a target we can determine the @xmath13 coordinates of its image .",
    "but in the general case we would like to do the opposite : knowing the position of a target on the sensor plane , we would like to retrieve the corresponding @xmath0 coordinates in the pinhole reference frame . if no other informations are available , eqs.([eq::pinhole ] ) do not have a unique solution in the unknown @xmath34 so that @xmath0 reconstruction is not feasible making use of one camera only , and at least two cameras are needed .    in the special case of targets lying on a plane , extra information about the mutual position between the camera and the plane where the motion occurs , i.e. extrinsic parameters , can be used to define an homography .",
    "eqs.([eq::pinhole ] ) can then be inverted and the @xmath0 positions of the targets can be retrieved making use of one camera only .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in this section we will not address this general case , but only the easier particular situation when the motion happens on a plane parallel to the camera sensor .",
    "the interested reader can retrieve the exact formulation for the general planar motion putting together the information written in this section and in the following one , where the general @xmath0 case is discussed .    in the special case of targets lying on a plane parallel to the sensor , i.e. fixed @xmath9 , eqs.([eq::pinhole ] )",
    "can be inverted and the @xmath0 position of a target projected in @xmath29 can be computed as : @xmath35        consider now two targets @xmath36 and @xmath37 on the same @xmath9-plane , and their images @xmath38 and @xmath39 as in fig.[fig : pinhole_model]b . thanks again to similarity between triangles , the distance between the two targets @xmath40 and the distance between their projections @xmath41 satisfy the following equation : @xmath42 so that @xmath4 fixes the ratio between distances in the @xmath0 and @xmath13 space .    with the same argument",
    "it can be shown that : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .    in the field of collective behavior when we deal with cells or bacteria moving on a glass slide or fish in swallow water",
    ", the motion happens on a preferential plane .",
    "setting up the camera in such a way that the sensor is parallel to this special plane , the displacement in the @xmath9 direction is negligible ; @xmath9 can be considered constant and the equations above hold .",
    "thus , measuring with an high precision instrument the distance , @xmath9 , between the sensor and the plane where the experiment takes place , it is possible to reconstruct the position of each target in the pinhole reference frame . in the following",
    "we will refer to these particular cases as @xmath13 experiments .",
    "the ambiguity of the @xmath0 position of a target from its image on one camera only , can be easily solved making use of two or more cameras . for the sake of simplicity , from now on",
    "we take into account only system of two synchronized cameras , having the same focal length and sensors of the same size .",
    "consider , as in fig[fig : pinhole_system]a , a three dimensional target @xmath1 in the @xmath0 real world and its projections @xmath48 and @xmath49 on the sensor plane of two cameras , denoted by left and right .",

    "in this section we give some suggestions on how to choose the properly set up when performing @xmath13 and @xmath0 experiments making use of the theoretical relations for the error described in the previous sections .",
    "when dealing with one camera only , the magnification ratio , @xmath4 plays a crucial role in the choice of the set up . as shown in section  [ section::general ] , the magnification ratio fixes the correspondence between distances expressed in meters in the real world and distances expressed in pixels units on the sensor plane .",

    "a second issue is related to the minimum appreciable distance . with the same argument used above",
    ", it can be shown that the minimum reconstructable metric distance in the @xmath0 real world corresponds to one pixel on the sensor and it is defined by @xmath234 and expressed in meters .",
    "this means that two objects at a mutual distance shorter than @xmath235 can not be distinguished in the picture .",
    "it is generally very useful to have an estimate of the interparticle distance of the group of interest and choose @xmath4 in such a way that on average the distance between imaged objects is larger than @xmath236 or @xmath230 pixels .",

    "if we denote by @xmath165 the acceptable threshold for the absolute error on short @xmath221 and by @xmath252 the acceptable relative error for the large distances , we can define the set up the system imposing the two following inequalities : @xmath253 the above inequalities can be used to define an upper bound for both the ratios @xmath212 and @xmath4 and find a set of suitable parameters which allow accuracy in the @xmath0 reconstruction in the desired common field of view , respecting also the constraint due to the objects size and interparticle distances .    in many cases",

    "we manage to keep relative errors on large distances smaller than @xmath139 and absolute errors on short distances below @xmath278 ( over distances of about @xmath277 ) .    independently on the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters calibration procedures and on the segmentation software used , the best way to reduce the reconstruction error is to design the proper set up .",
    "the strategy is to choose large @xmath26 and @xmath76 trying to be as close as possible to the group of interest .",
    "but at the end of the day , the only way to guarantee the reliability of the retrieved trajectories is to take care of the error while planning the experiment and then test the accuracy .",
