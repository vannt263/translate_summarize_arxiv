    "galaxy formation is one of the fundamental processes driving the evolution of our universe .",
    "however , the details of its underlying mechanisms are not well understood .",
    "there are many physical processes involved in galaxy formation and evolution such as star formation , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) formation , their feedback , and supernovae .",
    "for example , observations have demonstrated that masses of supermassive blackholes in galactic centers correlate with the stellar masses and stellar velocity dispersions of galactic bulges ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this correlation suggests that galaxies and supermassive blackholes in galactic centers co - evolve while interacting with each other .",
    "however , the details of the physical processes involved in their interactions are not well understood .",
    "some cosmological hydrodynamic simulations for galaxy and agn formation have partially succeeded in reproducing observational results such as the agn luminosity function and agn number density evolution ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "however , sufficient data to demonstrate the result s statistical significance are lacking . to improve the mass resolution of these simulations ,",
    "relatively small simulation boxes have been used ( less than @xmath8 ) , making it difficult to follow the formation and evolution of numerous galaxies and agns at high redshifts . since cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with large boxes and sufficient mass resolution remain computationally challenging , a large gap exists between numerical simulations and observations for high redshifts .    one way to bridge this gap is to use a semi - analytic galaxy formation model in which galaxy and agn formation is modeled phenomenologically within merger histories of dark matter halos ( merger trees ) taken from cosmological _",
    "n_-body simulations or the analytic extended press  schechter model ( eps ; @xcite ) . examples of successful semi - analytic galaxy formation models are the @xmath9gc  @xcite model based on the mitaka model @xcite and its successor , the @xmath0gc  model ( makiya et al . , in prep ) .",
    "most recent semi - analytic models use merger trees taken from large cosmological _ n_-body simulations , which can easily provide spatial information about galaxies and agns . generating merger trees using the eps method is appealing because the computational cost is low .",
    "however , this method does not provide spatial information , and its merger statistics are significantly different from those of cosmological simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rarity of the objects that can be obtained in semi - analytic models depends on the box size of the adopted cosmological _ n_-body simulations . in particular , bright agns at high redshifts are rare objects .",
    "their number density is only @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to obtain a statistically significant number of mock galaxies and agns at high redshifts , a high mass resolution and large spatial volume are necessary .",
    "our previous study , which was based on a cosmological simulation with @xmath11 particles in a @xmath12 box , shows that the agn downsizing trend naturally emerges @xcite .",
    "however , the number of agns at @xmath13 was only @xmath14 , complicating the discussion of the spatial clustering of agns and their evolution .",
    "galaxies at high redshifts are smaller than those at low redshifts .",
    "a high mass resolution is required to follow the hierarchical formation of these small galaxies . to compare these results with forthcoming wide and deep observations of galaxies and agns provided by the subaru hyper ",
    "cam @xcite , we need extremely large simulations based on state - of - the - art cosmology .",
    "most of the simulations in the existing literature do not meet these requirements .",
    "one typical simulation suite that succeeded in many scientific aspects is the millennium runs @xcite .",
    "the box sizes of the millennium and millennium - xxl simulations are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , which are large enough to obtain a large number of bright agns .",
    "however , their mass resolutions are too poor to capture small galaxy formations . the box size of the millennium - ii simulation ( @xmath8 ) is too small to obtain a sufficient number of agns , but its mass resolution is better than the other millennium variations .",
    "thus , it may be difficult to compare mock catalogs of these simulations with forthcoming wide and deep agn observations .",
    "the cosmology of the millennium runs is based on the first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite , which differs significantly from recent results obtained by the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "however , the different cosmology may not be a problem by using a rescaling algorithm @xcite , as also shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to address these problems , we conducted a suite of ultralarge cosmological _",
    "n_-body simulations , the @xmath0gc  simulation suite .",
    "the largest volume used in this suite is @xmath3 , and the highest mass resolution is @xmath17 .",
    "the largest @xmath0gc  simulation includes @xmath18 dark matter particles in a box of @xmath3 .",
    "the mass of each particle is @xmath19 .",
    "compared with the millennium simulation @xcite , our simulation offers the advantages of a mass resolution that is four times better and a spatial volume that is 11 times larger .",
    "simulations utilizing boxes greater than @xmath5 have previously achieved mass resolutions peaking at an order @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "our mass resolution is more than 20 times higher than other large volume simulations .",
    "the cosmology of our simulation is based on state - of - the - art observational results obtained by the planck satellite @xcite , which provide significantly different cosmological parameters from those adopted in previous studies . by accomplishing unprecedentedly high mass resolution and statistical power ,",
    "our simulation is more advanced than any simulation to date and provides the most accurate tools for studying galaxy and agn formation and cosmology .    in this study",
    ", we present details of the @xmath0gc  simulations . in  [ sec : method ] , we describe the basic properties of the simulations and the applied numerical methods . the basic results , including mass function , mass accretion rate , statistics of formation redshift , and statistics of merger , are presented in  [ sec : result ] .",

    "the @xmath0gc  simulation suite consists of six large cosmological @xmath21-body simulations with varying mass resolutions and box sizes .",
    "the details of the six simulations are outlined in table [ tab : simulations ] . in the largest run , named @xmath0gc - l , we simulated the motions of @xmath18 dark matter particles with a mass resolution of @xmath22 in a comoving box of @xmath23 .",
    "we performed two simulations with smaller boxes and the same mass resolution , namely , @xmath24 particles in a @xmath25 box ( @xmath0gc - m ) and @xmath11 particles in a @xmath12 box ( @xmath0gc - s ) .",
    "these smaller simulations allow us to perform resolution studies . in two additional runs , we simulated the motions of @xmath11 particles using higher mass resolutions and smaller boxes than those of the other three simulations .",

    "since this simulation adopts an equivalent mass resolution and eight times larger spatial volume compared with those of @xmath0gc - h2 , galaxies may be studied at high redshifts with unprecedentedly high mass resolutions and statistics .",
    "the initial conditions used in these simulations were generated by a publicly available code , 2lptic particles .",
    "] , using second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the adopted cosmological parameters were based on an observation of the cosmic microwave background obtained by the planck satellite @xcite , namely , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . to calculate the transfer function , we used the online version of camb @xcite .",
    "all simulations began at @xmath37 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     given a halo with mass @xmath38 at redshift @xmath39 and its merger tree , we computed the merger mass ratio @xmath40 , which is the ratio between the masses of the most massive progenitor and other progenitors .",
    "we then calculated the number of mergers per halo as a function of @xmath41 and the descendant halo mass @xmath38 .",
    "this definition of the mean merger rate is the same as that used in @xcite but is different from that discussed in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mmr_xi ] shows the number of mergers in the @xmath0gc - l , @xmath0gc - h1 , and @xmath0gc - h2 simulations , per halo , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , as a function of the merger mass ratio @xmath41 at @xmath29 for three descendant mass bins , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we only plot @xmath41 ranges in which @xmath46 is larger than the halos of 100 particles . in addition , we exclude @xmath41 bins containing less than 80 mergers . for the mean merger rate at @xmath29",
    ", we counted the number of mergers between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the three simulations smoothly connect with each other although ranges with overlap are rather narrow .",
    "however , this configuration allows us to obtain the relation over a wide range of the merger mass ratios @xmath41 from @xmath49 to unity .    in all mass ranges ,",
    "the dependence of the mean merger rate on the mass ratio resembles a power law starting at the smallest mass ratio ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the slope flattens as the mass ratio increases ( @xmath51 ) , which is consistent with results of previous studies @xcite .",
    "the mean merger rate weakly depends on the halo mass such that halos with higher masses have larger numbers of mergers .",
    "cluster - sized halos ( @xmath52 ) experience @xmath531.5 more mergers with high mass ratio ( @xmath54 ) than galaxy - sized halos ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the mass dependence is more striking in figure [ fig : mmr_z0 ] , which shows the halo mass dependence of the integrated mean merger rate at @xmath29 for @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "integrations were done from @xmath41 to unity .",
    "the merger rate s weak dependence on the halo mass is qualitatively consistent with previous studies ( @xcite ; dashed line )",
    ". we confirm it over a wider mass range ( @xmath58 to @xmath59 ) because of the high resolution and powerful statistics of the @xmath0gc  simulations .",
    "this qualitative agreement suggests that the mass dependence is weak and scales as @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the number of mergers with high mass ratio ( @xmath61 ) of @xmath62 halos is @xmath63 times larger than that of @xmath64 halos .",
    "@xcite updated this fitting function using the millennium - ii simulation . because the definition of the halo mass in their fitting function is different from",
    "that used in this study and @xcite , we do not compare our results with @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : mmr_z0 ] , the fitting function of @xcite slightly overpredicts the number of mergers , regardless of the merger mass ratio . to check the effect of different adopted cosmological parameters between the @xmath0gc  and millennium simulations",
    ", we performed an additional simulation with the cosmology used in the millennium simulations .",
    "the number of particles used was @xmath65 , and the comoving box size was @xmath6 .",
    "the mass resolution was effectively equivalent with that adopted in the @xmath0gc - h1 simulation . in figure",
    "[ fig : mmr_z0_ms ] , we plot the halo mass dependence of the integrated mean merger rate for this and @xmath0gc - h1 simulations .",
    "clearly , the difference is tiny .",
    "this result implies that the difference in the mean merger rate might be caused by the implementation of extracting merger trees or the different mass resolutions .",
    "we fit merger rates at @xmath29 in each mass bin into the following function , @xmath66 .",

    "the best fit parameters are listed in table [ tab : merger_rate ] .",
    "we found that best fit parameters show large scatters , implying that the merger rate can not be described accurately by a single universal function ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "non - universality makes it difficult to obtain an accurate single fitting function for the mean merger rate .",

    "we fitted it to merger rates at @xmath29 in each mass bin , i.e. , the fitting parameter was four , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the resolution of the time interval between the snapshots in the @xmath0gc  simulations allow us to study the redshift evolution of the mean merger rate up to @xmath72 for the @xmath0gc - l simulation and up to @xmath73 for the @xmath0gc - h1 and @xmath0gc - h2 simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : mmr_evo ] shows the redshift evolution of the integrated mean merger rate for three different mass bins ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath59 ) and five @xmath41 bins ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath57 , and @xmath79 ) .",
