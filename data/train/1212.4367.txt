    "<S> is that even at weak disorder , the regime of diffusive transport extends well beyond energies of the unperturbed model into the lifshitz tails . </S>",
    "<S> as will be explained , the mechanism for the appearance of extended states in this non - perturbative regime are disorder - induced resonances . </S>",
