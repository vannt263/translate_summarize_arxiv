    "hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) have velocities so great ( @xmath5@xmath1 ) that they are gravitationally unbound to the milky way galaxy .",
    "since the discovery of the first hvs by @xcite , six additional hvss have been found . the age and radial velocities of all but one hvs are consistent with them originating from the galactic centre , the most natural site for producing them ( hills 1988 ) . as more hvss",
    "are found , they can be used to constrain many properties of both the galactic centre as well as the milky - way galaxy as a whole , providing information about the galactic potential @xcite , the merger history of the sgr  a *  @xcite , as well as the mass distribution of stars near sgr  a*.    nearly 17 years before the initial discovery by @xcite , @xcite  first proposed that hvss should populate the galaxy and provide indirect evidence for the existence of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in the galactic centre .",
    "@xcite  showed that when a tight stellar binary ( with a separation @xmath6au ) gets sufficiently close to a smbh , it will be disrupted by its strong tidal field .",
    "consequently , one member of the binary could be ejected from the galactic centre with sufficient energy to escape the gravitational potential of the entire galaxy @xcite .",
    "the other binary member is expected to remain in a highly eccentric orbit around the smbh ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite  analysed the production rate of hvss in more detail , specifically for stars originating near the smbh in our galaxy , sgr  a*. the authors also corrected the initial calculation of @xcite  and accounted for the diffusion of hard binaries into the `` loss  cone '' , finding the production rate of hvss to be @xmath7yr@xmath8 , nearly three orders of magnitude below the previous estimate .",
    "@xcite  also looked at two additional mechanisms for producing hvss .",
    "they found that the rate could easily be higher ( @xmath9yr@xmath8 ) if sgr  a *  had a massive binary companion ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also determined that star - star scattering near sgr  a *  resulted in a nearly undetectable rate , due to physical collisions among the two stars .    in examining the rate estimate from @xcite one may adopt a simple mass function ( mf ) for stars , @xmath10 to estimate the total number of b  type hvss in the galactic halo . using the salpeter mf slope @xmath11 and a minimum mass limit of @xmath12",
    "one expects there to be about @xmath13 hvss with masses between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , consistent with the observed rate for such stars @xcite .",
    "however this is an overestimate .",
    "the salpeter mf overestimates the total number of stars with mass @xmath16 , since star formation occurs continuously over time near the galactic centre and massive stars have short lifetimes . accounting for continuous star formation as well as a more realistic distribution of binary parameters ,",
    "found a lower total hvs rate of @xmath17yr@xmath8 yielding @xmath18 hvs in the entire galaxy with mass between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the discrepancy between this calculation and the number of observed hvss may be overcome by massive perturbers in the galactic centre , which reduce the relaxation time and increase the rate to that observed . nevertheless , their results are highly sensitive to the mass distribution of the perturbers . in their calculations",
    "the authors use a very flat slope for the distribution of masses which has not been well constrained by observations . in their estimate , they assume that all stars are initially relaxed and therefore fill the entire energy - momentum space .",
    "the lifetimes of the stars observed by @xcite  are very similar to the enhanced relaxation time , except in the most optimistic case of .",
    "we argue then that the total number of b - type hvss given by may still be an overestimate , and an additional source of hvss may be required .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel source of hvss in the milky way : in the dense stellar cusp near sgr  a * _ stars scatter off stellar - mass black holes _ ( bhs ) that are segregated there @xcite and recoil out of the galactic centre .",
    "the existence of stars on radial orbits originating from the galactic centre was first proposed by @xcite as evidence for a segregated bh cluster . here",
    ", we show that there should exist a high - velocity tail of stars , significant enough in number to account for some if not all of the hvss observed by @xcite .",
    "this paper  is organised as follows . in  [ stars ] we describe the distribution of stars and bhs around sgr  a*. we describe in detail our assumptions and calculations in  [ theory ] , and present our results in  [ results ] .",
    "finally , in  [ discussion ] , we discuss the observational implications and prospects for future work .",
    "using near - infrared adaptive optics imaging , @xcite  showed that the density of stars in the innermost @xmath2pc of the galactic centre is well - fit by a broken power - law radial profile , @xmath19pc@xmath20 , where @xmath21 for @xmath22pc and @xmath23 for @xmath24pc , assuming that sgr  a *  is at a distance of @xmath25kpc @xcite .",
    "additional observations of the background light density show that the cusp might be slightly shallower in the inner few arcseconds @xcite .",
    "indeed , for a dynamically relaxed stellar system , stars near a smbh are expected to be in a cusp profile with @xmath26 , depending on the mass distribution of the stars ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite  normalised the density profile by assuming that the total mass of stars within @xmath27pc of sgr  a *  is @xmath28 , and that the mass distribution follows the same density profile as the observed stars with a constant mass  to  light ratio . invariably , stellar",
    "evolution and mass segregation should alter the mass  to  light ratio at different radii @xcite , and cause the actual density profile to deviate from the observed number counts of stars .",
    "in addition to determining that the stars are in a cusp profile , the observations also indicate that the stars have formed mostly continuously with a standard initial mf @xcite .    besides the observed cusp of stars , there are two additional structures found near sgr  a *  that suggest ongoing star formation very close to the smbh . within 1 arcsec ( @xmath29pc ) of sgr",

    "dispersed throughout the stars there should be a group of stellar - mass bhs brought there through mass segregation @xcite . assuming that all the stars in the stellar cusp around sgr  a *  formed @xmath34gyr ago , @xcite predicted that there should be @xmath35 bhs within the central pc of the milky way . in their analysis , @xcite estimated that @xmath36 of the stellar mass is in bhs given an approximately salpeter mf .",

    "in addition , large @xmath47 monte - carlo simulations of relaxation and stellar evolution in the galactic centre found the formation of a similar cusp of bhs @xcite .",
    "however , in these simulations the density of bhs at @xmath4pc was found to be ten times higher and the density of stars to be about five times lower than in @xcite .",
    "very few observations constrain number of stellar - mass bhs considered here , however x - ray observations seem to place an upper limit of @xmath48 bhs in the inner parsec @xcite .",

    "the observations of the young disk of stars @xcite , as well as the cluster of s - stars , suggest that the population of stars at 0.1pc from sgr  a *  should be younger and more massive than at @xmath197pc .",
    "this is further supported by the steep drop in b - stars outside of 0.5pc @xcite .",
    "in addition , binaries with b - stars ( @xmath198myr ) may also not be fully relaxed as has been assumed in many previous calculations , and therefore the diffusion rate of the most massive binaries into the loss - cone may be lower by orders of magnitudes .    in the survey of @xcite ,",
    "the observed hvss have the same colour as blue horizontal branch stars ( bhbs ) and have yet to be distinguished from b - stars with high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the calculations shown here suggest that low mass stars , such as bhbs and their progenitors , can become hvss with high efficiency if they are in the inner 0.1pc of sgr  a*. although tidal disruption rates may be enhanced by massive perturbers , bhbs must undergo significant mass loss , causing them to widen or even disrupt , and therefore are unlikely to be found in the tight binaries which are disrupted @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic identification of one hypervelocity bhb star would be strong evidence in support of the mechanism presented here , or an inspiralling massive bh @xcite .",
    "however , the expected rate of hypervelocity bhbs depends on uncertain details of stellar evolution and goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "a population of bhbs ejected through this mechanism may be spun up through repeated encounters in the bh cusp @xcite , as well as during the final encounter which ejects them ( h.  perets , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , a rotating bhb star may appear to be more like a b - star without detailed spectroscopic evidence .",
    "in fact , the hvs he 0437 - 5439 @xcite , should not be ruled out as being a bhb star based on its required spin value alone .    there is a curious link between the number of hvss observed by @xcite and the s - stars observed orbiting sgr  a*. some s - stars may be the former companions to the hvss from tidally disrupted binaries . interestingly",
    ", there exists a similar connection between hvss scattered off of the bhs and the s - stars as well , although perhaps not one  to  one . for every strong encounter that produces a hvs ,",
    "there is likely another encounter which can bring the star closer to sgr  a * , perhaps kicking out the bh instead , similar to the scenario proposed by @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", the scattering of a small fraction of young stars from many previous disks into the inner @xmath199pc may result in a population similar to the s - stars ( oleary , r.  m.  & loeb , a.  2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "however , we should note that if the s - star are in fact the remnants of tidally disrupted binaries , then this mechanism will only be secondary , as it is only ejects a small fraction of such stars .",
    "there is obviously considerable uncertainty in our models .",
    "the rate of diffusion of stars both close to and far from sgr  a *  into eccentric orbits is important to understanding both the mechanisms as well as the source of the observed b - type hvss in the galactic halo . in both cases ,",
    "it is most likely that the stars formed on relatively circular orbits , whether in a disk around sgr  a *  or in an inspiralling cluster .",
    "large scale simulations similar to those already done by @xcite can help resolve the uncertainties of relaxation , and with modifications , may be able to account for the conditions of continuous star formation over long periods of time . for low mass stars , physical collisions may deplete the total number of stars , and reduce the rate . in our discussion",
    "we have not considered the effects of resonant relaxation @xcite near sgr  a * , which may have two counteracting effects on our rate calculation .",
    "resonant relaxation may flatten the cusp and deplete the number density of stars and bhs in the innermost 0.01pc ; at the same time , it may also drive more massive stars into the same region producing more b - type hvss @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we also neglected the migration of massive objects near sgr  a*. if , as suggested by @xcite , many intermediate mass bhs ( imbhs with masses @xmath200 ) populate the inner pc of the galactic centre and merge with sgr  a *  every @xmath201@xmath202yr , then the cusp of stellar - mass bhs and stars would not regenerate fast enough to produce hvss through bh - star encounters @xcite but instead could produce them through imbh - star encounters @xcite .",
    "bhs with masses between most stellar mass bhs and imbhs ( e.g. @xmath203 ) , may also form through standard binary evolution @xcite .",
    "such bhs could considerably increase the rate of hvss , even if they are relatively rare .",
    "we would like to thank reinhard genzel for discussing his most recent results on the stars near sgr  a * , as well as warren brown and hagai perets for their helpful discussions and comments on our manuscript .",
