    "during the recent years , cloud - assisted image services are widely used for various applications , such as individual image storage and sharing by smartphone ( e.g. , facebook and qq ) , healthcare image monitoring by wireless sensors @xcite and so on .",
    "however , this also brings serious security threat to users because of the public access of cloud @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , more and more resource - constrained smart devices are used as sensors for sampling these image signals , this also poses a great challenge to the development of appropriate image encryption techniques for mobile device .",
    "existing cloud security image encryption techniques usually follow compression then encryption paradigm .",
    "these techniques require image acquisition device to perform either expensive coding or encryption operation @xcite on original image .",
    "for example , transformed - based image coding techniques require complex encoding computation . in recent years ,",
    "compressive sensing ( cs ) has bee proposed for sparse / compressible signal sampling and compression . c. wang _ et.al . _",
    "proposed a cloud - assisted computation outsourcing scheme for healthcare video monitoring @xcite .",
    "they implemented image encryption by linear programming ( lp ) problem transformation , which is the application of lp secure outsourcing problem @xcite .",
    "however , the transformation overhead may easily outweigh the benefits brought by their outsourcing scheme . as a result ,",
    "existing results are not appropriate for resource constrained smart device as it requires low - complexity image compression and encryption .",
    "in particular , we notice that existing techniques require expensive computation resource mainly due to the following two separated processes : image compression and encryption . to this end",
    ", we propose a novel * * e**ncrypressive * * c**loud - assisted * * i**mage * * s**ervice scheme ( ecis ) . in ecis",
    ", we implement image compression and encryption simultaneously via cs , which can significantly reduce the resource consumption for sampling and receiver devices .",
    "meanwhile , we implement cloud storage and computation outsourcing for image user at no additional communication cost .",
    "the development of ecis faces several unique challenges : ( 1 ) how to design encryption matrix to meet cs theory and image signal encryption without increasing transmission cost ? ( 2 ) how to implement encryption matrix to meet low - complexity requirement for encoder and end user ? ( 3 ) how to guarantee user s privacy performance with our design encryption matrix ?    to address the above challenges , we design an encryption matrix based on inverse matrix and mutual information to meet cs encryption encoding and decoding at no additional transmission cost . to achieve low - complexity encryption and decryption for encoder and end user , we exploit adaptive perturbation matrix as our encryption matrix .",
    "moreover , we conduct theoretical analysis that demonstrates several security properties and low - complexity of our scheme",
    ". the contributions of this paper are as the follows .",
    "\\1 ) we present a novel encrypressive cloud - assisted image service scheme via cs , called ecis .",
    "our scheme implements the image signal storage and computation outsourcing for both sampling device and end user .",
    "meanwhile , it also can protect user s image signal privacy .",
    "\\2 ) we formulate our security problem according to security and system requirements , and design an encryption matrix based on mutual information .",
    "our designed encryption matrix implements compression and encryption simultaneously .",
    "we also conduct theoretical analyses of both image security and system overhead .",
    "\\3 ) with the extensive experiments , we show that ecis not only protect image privacy efficiently but also meet the user s adaptive security demand .",
    "the experimental results also display that ecis decrease @xmath0 time cost for sampling device and end user compared with the existing cs based image processing approach .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "presents the related preliminaries .",
    "the problem statement is given in section 3 .",
    "the detailed design of ecis is presented in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we give the theoretical performance analysis of ecis .",
    "section 6 reports our experimental results .",
    "we present a literature review of existing work in section 7 .",
    "finally , we make a conclusion and future work in section 8 .",
    "cs theory asserts that a relatively small number linear combination of a sparse signal could contain most of its salient information @xcite .",
    "this technique shifts the computation cost from encoder to decoder compared with transformed - based image compression @xcite . assuming that @xmath1 is a @xmath2-sparse signal , which has only @xmath2 non - zero components .",
    "thus , the information can be extracted from @xmath3 by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an @xmath6 measurement matrix , @xmath7 is measurement vector and @xmath8 . if @xmath5 satisfies the restricted isometric property ( rip ) and @xmath9 @xcite , the sparse signal @xmath3 could be recovered with high probability .",
    "cand@xmath10s , romberg , and tao @xcite and donoho @xcite have shown many random matrices that satisfy the rip such as gaussian identity distribution matrix , @xmath111 bernoulli matrix and so on .",
    "the signal @xmath3 could be recovered via @xmath12 optimization as @xmath13 there have been many efficient algorithms to solve the above problems such as basis pursuit @xcite , orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) algorithm @xcite , cosamp @xcite and so on .    the real image signal , however , is rarely sparse , which can be transformed into sparse signal by a sparse representation basis . in other words",
    ", this signal can be well - approximated by a sparse signal , which is called compressible signal .",
    "for example , an image signal @xmath14 can usually be transformed into a sparse signal @xmath3 under discrete cosine transformation ( dct ) basis or discrete wavelet transformation ( dwt ) basis . given",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 is a @xmath17 representation basis , @xmath18^t$ ] is the coefficient vector of @xmath19 under @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath19 is compressible , then the magnitudes of the sorted coefficients @xmath20 observe a power - law decay : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constants .",
    "the compressible signal @xmath19 can be represented accurately by only @xmath2 ( @xmath24 ) coefficients @xcite .      in information theory ,",
    "mutual information represents the mean relevance of two random variables which is defined as follows .",
    "[ def_mu ] @xcite consider two random variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 with a joint probability mass function @xmath27 , marginal probability mass functions @xmath28 and conditional probability function @xmath29 . the mutual information @xmath30 is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent entropy and conditional entropy , respectively .",
    "the smaller @xmath34 is , the less the information of @xmath25 obtained from @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two independent random variables , @xmath34 equals to zero .",
    "it means that no information of @xmath25 could be obtained from @xmath26 .",
    "fig.[f_arc ] shows the overall architecture of ecis .",
    "the system consists of three parties : sampling device , cloud , and end user .",
    "the sampling device is responsible for sampling , compressing , and encrypting the original image signal . after image sampling ,",
    "the device carries out compression and encryption operations .",
    "then the sampling device uploads its compressed and encrypted signal @xmath35 and measurement matrix @xmath5 to the cloud .",
    "if an end user wants to access the image , he should send its request and sparse representation basis , @xmath16 , to the cloud .",
    "cloud receives the user s image request and @xmath16 , and calculates the sparse signal @xmath36 via cs decoding algorithm and sends it to the end user . after receiving @xmath36 ,",
    "the end user is responsible for recovering the original image @xmath37 by @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the key of encryption matrix cloud be securely transmitted between the sampling device and end user . in practice , sampling device and",
    "end user could be the same smart device(e.g . ,",
    "smartphone ) .",
    "* design goals : * our goals consist of three aspects : ( 1 ) the sampling device should implement image compression and protect the user s image privacy .",
    "meanwhile , the compression and encryption process should have low complexity and transmission cost .",
    "( 2 ) the cloud should carry out complicated cs - based image decoding without leaking user s privacy .",
    "( 3 ) the image recovery and decryption at end user should also have low complexity .      before the problem formulation ,",
    "we first introduce several important notations used in cs - based image compression . the original image signal and its sparse representation basis",
    "are denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding sparse signal of @xmath37 under @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath3 , namely , @xmath38 .",
    "firstly , we review cs - based image compression and decoding for image signal @xmath37 .",
    "the compression process is expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 presents the measurement vector .",
    "the decoding process is expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the recovery sparse signal corresponding to @xmath37 , with @xmath43 .",
    "if the attacker does not know @xmath5 and @xmath16 , the measurement vector @xmath40 can be considered as ciphertext @xcite . however , if the recovery process is carried out in cloud , the measurement vector @xmath40 is no longer private because both @xmath5 and @xmath16 are public .",
    "then how to outsource expensive cs decoding task to the cloud without revealing the original image signal ?",
    "since the measurement matrix has a strong encryption function , can we consider different measurement matrices for encoding and decoding of sampling device and cloud ?",
    "assuming that the decoding measurement matrix used in cloud is @xmath5 , which could be general measurement matrix such as gaussian random matrix , @xmath44 bernoulli matrix @xcite .",
    "the encoding measurement matrix is denoted by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a @xmath17 matrix .",
    "then , the image compression process is expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath35 is measurement vector corresponding to @xmath45 . due to",
    "@xmath48 , eq . [ e_cry_cs_enc1 ] can be expressed as @xmath49 if @xmath46 is invertible , @xmath50 can be converted as @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",

    "therefore , if we can find a suitable matrix @xmath46 satisfied three conditions : ( 1 ) @xmath46 is invertible .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath46 can not decrease the sparsity of @xmath3 .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath3 can not be obtained from @xmath36 without @xmath46 .",
    "we can implement secure image data storage and cs decoding in the cloud .",
    "we next introduce the problem formulation . in the rest of this paper , @xmath5 and @xmath46",
    "are called measurement matrix and encryption matrix , respectively .",
    "if an attacker can not recover @xmath37 given @xmath36 and @xmath16 , we can securely implement image decoding in the cloud .",
    "therefore , our problem is to find an appropriate encryption matrix @xmath57 such that @xmath58 where @xmath59 is privacy exposure function which will be described later , @xmath60 is communication cost function .",
    "@xmath62 ensures that the transmission cost of our scheme is no larger than the original cs based image compression .",
    "in this section , we will discuss our encryption matrix design and implement in detail , and give each component design of our ecis .",
    "recall that our goal of encryption matrix is to ensure that the original sparse signal of user s image can not be obtained from the recovered sparse signal in the cloud .",
    "if the encryption matrix does not change the sparsity of original image signal , we can remove the condition of @xmath63 from the problem ( * p * ) .",
    "this is because when the measurement matrix is given , the number of cs measurements which only depends on the sparsity of the compressed signal .    in information theory ,",
    "mutual information represents the shared information between two random variables according to definition [ def_mu ] . in this work ,",
    "we exploit mutual information as our privacy exposure function .",
    "intuitively , it measures what extent @xmath3 can be inferred from @xmath36 .",

    "meanwhile , @xmath46 has encryption function because it could implement all the elements of @xmath3 and @xmath36 to be independent to each other . since @xmath105 equals to @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath105 only perturbs the element location of @xmath3 , and the sparsity of @xmath3 is not changed .",

    "if all the elements of @xmath3 are perturbed by @xmath46 , we only need to implement the equal probability random perturbation for each element .",
    "in fact , @xmath46 could be easily implemented by a random seed , which is also considered as the key between the sampling device and the end user .    to quantify the privacy protection level more effectively , and make a more detailed description on security considerations",
