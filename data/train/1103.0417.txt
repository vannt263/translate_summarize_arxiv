    "the word `` revolution '' came from the latin `` revolutio '' , which means `` a turn around ''  a fundamental change that takes place in relatively short period of time .",
    "although , revolutions occurred many times in human history , scientists still investigate what are possible reasons for a revolution .",
    "particularly interesting empirical examples are recent protests in egypt and tunisia . in",
    "egypt protests started on tuesday , january 25 2011 .",
    "these were the first protests on such a large scale to be seen in egypt since the 1970s . what was the reason , why these protests begun on january 25 ? sociologists claim that it was a domino effect ",
    "egyptian revolution has been inspired by the successful revolution in tunisia .",
    "immediately the next question arise  what was the reason for the revolution in tunisia ?",
    "again , sociologists and journalists claim that the answer is known  it has been sparked by the suicide of a young man who could not find a job and was barred from selling fruit without a permit .",
    "there are of course many other examples of revolutions that took place in history .",
    "usually , reasonable explanation is given by sociologists _",
    "post factum_. on the other hand , knowing the history one can always find some explanation .",
    "the problem is that we can hardly predict exact moment or place of a revolution .",
    "is it true that every overturn has a direct source ?",
    "physicist s experience shows that if a system supports two stable states , then fluctuations can cause random transitions between those two states @xcite .",
    "recently such a spontaneous transitions , induced by a random noise , have been shown in a one - dimensional sznajd model of opinion dynamics @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the idea to introduce a random noise to the sznajd model has been proposed already in the original paper from 2000 @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of the idea no systematic studies have been performed . in 2005 de la lama et al . have included a social temperature effect in the model @xcite .",
    "they have assumed that at every time step an agent followed the rules of the sznajd model with probability @xmath0 , while with a probability @xmath1 rules were not fulfilled ( an agent adopted the opposite option than the one dictated by the rules ) @xcite .",
    "such a modification has led to so called contrarians behavior @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for @xmath2 the system was bistable with a probability density of magnetization having two maxima at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that for @xmath2 the system got ordered spontaneously selecting one of the stable solutions @xmath3 , while for @xmath4 the system became monostable and disordered @xcite .",
    "results obtained recently in @xcite for one - dimensional system confirmed those obtained by de la lama et al .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the finite system with random contrarian - like noise led to spontaneous transitions between two ordered stable states @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it should be recall here that the possibility of spontaneous transitions in the sznajd model with noise has been also investigated by wio et al . by including an external modulated field .",
    "this is well known that usually bistable systems response to a periodic external force in the presence of noise .",
    "this phenomena is known as a stochastic resonance and it has been widely studied in various systems over last 30 years @xcite .",
    "wio et al .",
    "have shown that the system described by the sznajd model with contrarians did not show conventional stochastic resonance , but so called system size stochastic resonance .    in this paper we investigate different problem  spontaneous transitions not induced by any external force .",
    "we consider again generalized version of the sznajd model introduced in @xcite in which two types of social response ( conformity and anticonformity ) are possible .",
    "in @xcite we have shown , performing monte carlo simulations for one - dimensional system , that for small values of anticonformity level , spontaneous reorientations occur between two opposite consensus states ( all spins up or all spins down ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the same model on a complete graph , which allows us for analytical treatment .",
    "moreover , we show that results obtained for the complete graph are qualitatively different from those obtained for the one - dimensional system and more suitable to describe opinion dynamics in real social systems .",
    "we would like to clarify here that in econophysics and economy term anticonformity refers usually to contrarian behavior  a preference for taking a position opposed to that of the majority .",
    "in @xcite we have used a term anticonformity , that is usually used in social psychology @xcite , to distinguish between two commonly mixed up types of social response - anticonformity and nonconformity. while anticonformity is similar to conformity in the sense that both ( conformers and anticonformers ) acknowledge the group norm ( the conformers agree with the norm , the anticonformers disagree ) , nonconformity means independence .",
    "as long as we do not focus on particular applications of the model ( financial , social or any others ) we can use interchangeably both terms contrarian and anticonformists.",
    "we consider a set of @xmath6 individuals , which are described by the binary variables @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) or @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) on a complete graph . at each elementary time step two individuals ( denoted by @xmath8 or @xmath10 )",
    "are chosen at random , and they influence a third randomly chosen individual ( denoted by @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) in the following way : @xmath13 first two processes correspond to conformity , and the next two describe anticonformity . above model is a particular case of the generalized sznajd model introduced in @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite that significant parameter of the model is the ratio @xmath14 and changing absolute values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 influence only a time scale .",
    "moreover , in the next section we show analytically that indeed stationary states depend only on the ratio @xmath17 . in the previous paper @xcite",
    "we have decided to investigate the case in which @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the only parameter of the model . in this paper",
    "we keep this assumption for monte carlo simulations , although we present also general analytic results for arbitrary values of @xmath20 .    in our previous paper @xcite , to investigate the model , we have provided monte carlo simulations with the random sequential updating mode and thus the time @xmath21 has been measured in the monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) which consisted of @xmath6 elementary updatings , i.e. @xmath22 . as usually , we have defined a public opinion as a magnetization of the system : @xmath23 monte carlo results for the one - dimensional system have shown that for small values of anticonformity level @xmath16 spontaneous reorientations occur between two extreme values of @xmath24 .",
    "we have shown that there is a special value of anticonformity level @xmath25 below which the system stays for most of time in the one of two possible consensus states ( @xmath24 ) and spontaneous reorientations occur randomly . above the threshold ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath26 system becomes monostable with magnetization fluctuating around zero @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the model on a complete graph , which allows us for analytical treatment .",
    "moreover , we show that in case of a complete graph , spontaneous reorientations occur not between two extreme values of @xmath24 , but between two stable solutions @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , in the case of a complete graph we observe continuous phase transition at @xmath29 , while discontinuous transition in a case of one - dimensional lattice .",
    "in this paper we focus mostly on the spontaneous transitions between stable states , which were not investigated analytically up till now .",
    "such a random transitions between two stable states are particularly important from social perspective to understand revolutions , protests and other fundamental social changes that take places in relatively short period of time .",
    "in the case of a complete graph the state of the system is completely described by the magnetization @xmath30 defined by eq .",

[ fig_analit ] ) : @xmath62     as a function of the ratio @xmath14 . below the threshold value @xmath63",
    "there are two possible values of magnetization , above the threshold there is no majority in the system . from social perspective",
