    "there is a long history of skyrmions from the particle physics to the condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "originally , skyrme introduced `` skyrmions '' in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) space to describe nucleons as elementary particles possessing nontrivial topological numbers  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , belavin and polyakov ( bp ) applied the concept to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ferromagnetic ( fm ) system and predicted a magnetic excitation carrying a nontrivial topological number , that is , the pontryagin number  @xcite .",
    "the bp - skyrmion is an exact solution of the nonlinear @xmath1 model .",
    "however this solution has a scale invariance , and hence the bp - skyrmion has no definite radius .",
    "it is necessary for a dynamically stable and physical skyrmion to have a definite radius .",
    "consequently , a skyrmion is characterized by two types of stabilities : the topological stability based on the conservation of a nontrivial pontryagin number , and the dynamical stability having a finite radius .",
    "some interactions are required in order to break the scale invariance .",
    "for instance , the dipole - dipole interaction breaks the scale invariance .",
    "however , since it is a long - distance force , the skyrmion size becomes very large in general  @xcite .",
    "recently , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) has attracted much attention to provide the skyrmion with a finite radius , where the resultant radius is of the order of nanometers  @xcite .",
    "it is called the magnetic skyrmion .",
    "magnetic skyrmions might be suitable for building next - generation nonvolatile memory devices based on their topological stability  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has also been proposed to utilize them in logic computing  @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the topological number is defined only in the continuum field theory with an infinitely large space .",
    "although the underlying system has a finite size and a lattice structure in the condensed matter physics , the topological number is well - defined , provided that the skyrmion spin texture is sufficiently smooth and sufficiently far away from the edge .",
    "thus it is an intriguing concept in the condensed matter physics possessing the aspect of the continuum theory and that of the lattice theory .",
    "we can actually leverage these properties for practical applications .",
    "it is possible to create or destroy magnetic skyrmions which are topologically stable  @xcite .",
    "as far as the topological analysis is concerned , a magnetic skyrmion with any topological number @xmath3 is possible .",
    "let us call such a skyrmion with @xmath4 a high - q skyrmion .",
    "it will be realized when the in - plane component of the spin rotates by @xmath5 and the skyrmion acquires a high helicity @xmath3 .",
    "however , only the magnetic skyrmion with @xmath0 has so far been realized .",
    "this is because that a static magnetic skyrmion with @xmath4 is unstable since the dmi can not prevent it from shrinking to a point , which we shall prove later . in this paper , employing a dynamical breaking of the scale invariance  @xcite , we create a high - q skyrmion with @xmath2 by applying a spin - polarized current perpendicular to the fm nanodisk with the dmi .",
    "we investigate in details how a high - q skyrmion with @xmath2 is created from a magnetic bubble with @xmath6 through successive creations of two bloch points .",
    "once the spin texture of a high - q skyrmion becomes sufficiently smooth with respect to the lattice spacing , the topological protection becomes active .",
    "namely , the resultant spin texture is topologically robust against fluctuations of various variables including the injected current itself .",
    "this is due to the fact that the topological number can not change continuously from its quantized value .",
    "however , when the current is switched off , the high - q skyrmion quickly shrinks to the order of the lattice scale and dissipates .",
    "the equilibrium and dissipation processes are well - described in terms of the rayleigh dissipation function composed of the energy injection and dissipation terms  @xcite .",
    "the dissipation is found to spread all over like a burst at the moment of the skyrmion generation and destruction  @xcite .",
    "the high - q skyrmion is a topologically protected dissipative structure .",
    "one might think that the concept is a self - contradictory proposition . however , this is not the case .",
    "we may suggest an analogy of the quantum hall ( qh ) state .",
    "it is well - known that the qh state at an integer filling factor is robust against impurities and also against the change of the external magnetic field .",
    "indeed the latter develops qh plateaux .",
    "the robustness is due to the fact that the state is protected by the conservation of the topological number , that is , the chern number .",
    "nonetheless , when the external magnetic field is switched off , the topological robustness is lost and the qh state collapses .",
    "clearly , the external magnetic field in the qh system corresponds to the injected spin current in the topologically stabilized dissipative structure of this work .",
    "our system is composed of a fm nanodisk and a spin - polarized current injection region with a radius of @xmath7 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ( see the appendix for modeling details ) .",
    "the development of the topological number @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "soon after the spin current is injected , @xmath3 suddenly increases to @xmath8 or @xmath9 from @xmath10 , and remains stable , in the presence of the dmi . on the other hand ,",
    "when the spin current is switched off , @xmath3 decreases to @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted that the high - q skyrmion can not be created dynamically without the dmi .",
    "we are interested in the process how a magnetic bubble with @xmath6 is converted into a magnetic skyrmion with @xmath11 . upon the application of the spin current",
    ", there is a large energy injected into the core through the spin transfer torque ( stt ) .",
    "the spins are forced to reverse within the core upon the spin - polarized current injection . due to the dmi",
    ", the spins are twisted around the core .",
    "the topological number is zero for such a state .",
    "this is a magnetic bubble with @xmath6 .",
    "we point out that the seed of a magnetic skyrmion is already present in the magnetic bubble . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , we show the densities of the in - plane components of the magnetization ( @xmath12 ) and the topological charge density @xmath13 of a magnetic bubble before the nucleation to a magnetic skyrmion with @xmath0 or @xmath9 .",
    "we clearly observe a pair ( two pairs ) of blue and red areas indicating negative and positive topological charge densities , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , we show the time evolution of the topological number , the total energy , the dmi energy , the average magnetization ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , and the rayleigh dissipation function @xmath17 for a high - q skyrmion with @xmath2 ( ) . the selected top - views are shown in fig .  [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the spin component @xmath16 measures the size of the skyrmion , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 contribute to the topological charge density .",
    "first , @xmath16 starts to decrease , implying that the spins are inverted in the disk region .",
    "however , the topological number remains zero , since the in - plane spin components point along the same direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) at @xmath18 ns .    the rayleigh dissipation function gives us a vivid information on how the dissipation occurs in the dissipative system .",
    "in the present system , the energy is injected into the core and dissipated in its outer side steadily before and after the nucleation of a magnetic skyrmion . however , the dissipation spreads around all over the fm nanodisk like a burst at the transition moment of the topological number from @xmath6 to @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ fig2](b ) at @xmath19 ns ) .",
    "we show a close - up of the change of the topological number @xmath3 around @xmath19 ns in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . clearly , there are two successive jumps of @xmath3 as @xmath20 .",
    "we also show the topological charge density , the energy density , and the spin distribution around @xmath19 ns in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    based on these",
    "we obtain the following picture of the nucleation process .",
    "we focus on the case where there are two pairs of blue and red areas in the domain boundary region of the magnetic bubble ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) .",
    "both the topological charge density @xmath13 and the energy density @xmath21 are large in these areas .",
    "in particular , there is a chance that @xmath21 becomes large in a lattice - scale area so that the area has almost @xmath22 .",
    "this happens when two spins are antiparallel with one down - spin site between them , at @xmath23 ps in fig .",
    "a single or a few spins make a large rotation in order to decrease the energy of the area . indeed , the antiparallel spins become parallel at @xmath24 ps in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in this process",
    "the topological number @xmath22 is lost , which is possible in the lattice theory .",
    "this phenomenon would be viewed as a generation of a bloch point in the continuum theory .",
    "this makes clearer the role of the bloch point presented by sampaio _",
    "et al_. in ref .  .",
    "there exists still a pair of blue and red areas .",
    "now , there is a chance that another lattice - scale area develops which has @xmath22 in the spin texture with @xmath0 .",
    "( note that there are two spins antiparallel at @xmath25 ps , which become parallel at @xmath26 ps . )",
    "it corresponds to the emergence of another bloch point . as a result",
    ", it turns out that two bloch points emerge successively in a single magnetic bubble .",
    "when the spin texture becomes sufficiently smooth , it yields a high - q skyrmion with @xmath2 .",
    "we have also numerically observed that a high - q skyrmion can be successfully created in a wide range of parameters as well as the spin current injection size , as shown for instance in fig .",

    "its topological number is almost @xmath9 but fluctuates slightly because the continuity of the spin texture of a deformed skyrmion is broken at finite temperature .    .",
    "a sudden change of the topological number @xmath3 occurs twice successively when the high - q skyrmion with @xmath2 is created or destroyed .",
    "the topological charge density @xmath13 , the energy density @xmath21 , and the spin - component distribution @xmath33 of the state indexed by @xmath34 in ( a ) and ( b ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , respectively . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]          the continuity of the spin texture is recovered since a smooth texture has a lower energy . then the topological protection becomes active .",
    "the dissipation function decreases rapidly and oscillates around zero .",
    "the system is relaxed to a steady state around @xmath35 ns .",
    "both the topological charge density and the rayleigh dissipation function are almost zero outside the domain wall encircling the high - q skyrmion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    oscillations in various variables occur due to the dmi .",
    "it is instructive to switch off the dmi in numerical simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we switch off the dmi at @xmath36 ns .",
    "first of all , the high - q skyrmion remains stable .",
    "second , the oscillations in the energy , the magnetization components , and the dissipation functions disappear . after the relaxation at @xmath37 ns ,",
    "the in - plane magnetization components and the dissipation functions becomes exactly zero ( ) .",
    "the spin texture is described precisely by the magnetization components of the domain wall .",
    "we show how the balance holds between the energy injection from the spin current and the dissipation by the gilbert damping in fig .",
    "the energy injection occurs in the vicinity of the edge of the current injection region ( @xmath38 ) while the dissipation occurs mostly within the domain wall encircling it ( @xmath39 ) together with energy flow from the inner to outer regions .",
    "this is due to the fact that spins precess within the domain wall .",
    "it is important to point out that this energy balance takes place automatically so as to keep the topological number unchanged . to check this",
    ", we change the spin current stepwise , which is shown in fig .",
    "the topological number remains to be @xmath9 when the spin current intensity changes even more than twice .",
    "the energy injection due to the stt becomes larger as the spin current density increases .",
    "accordingly , the energy dissipation due to the gilbert damping increases . as a result , the rayleigh dissipation function remains zero in average although it is oscillating .",
    "the total energy increases stepwise but remains almost constant for each current strength .",
    "the total @xmath40 decreases as the spin current density increases , which implies that the magnetic skyrmion expands for larger current density .",
    "we have shown that the magnetic skyrmion is topologically robust against a considerable change of the spin current injection .",
    "as we have stated , once it is created , the high - q skyrmion remains stable even if the dmi is switched off ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it is stable against the fluctuations of various variables .",
    "this is because a small change can induce only a small change of the topological number @xmath3 , but this is impossible since @xmath3 is a quantized quantity .",
    "this property is called the topological protection .      when the spin current is switched off at @xmath35 ns ,",
    "the topological number remains as @xmath2 until @xmath41 ns and suddenly decreases to @xmath6 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the radius of the magnetic skyrmion shrinks since the skyrmion core is fixed by the spin current against the shrinking force due to the kinetic energy as well as the external magnetic field ( ) .",
    "a close examination shows that the collapse of the topological number occurs in two steps as @xmath42 as in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b )",
    ". we may understand how the destruction of a magnetic skyrmion with @xmath2 occurs by investigating the time evolution of the topological charge density , the energy density , and the spin distribution around @xmath43 ns as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .    in the first step",
    "the energy density is localized almost on one lattice site , where a bloch point is generated and the topological number changes from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "the size of the magnetic skyrmion with @xmath0 shrinks almost to the order of the lattice site .",
    "the second step has some new features .",
    "the topological stability of the magnetic skyrmion is guaranteed by the fact that the core spin points in the direction opposite to the fm background .",
    "however , such a core spin disappears at @xmath44 ps since there is no lattice site at the core spin . as a result ,",
    "the spin texture becomes a vortex structure .",
    "accordingly , all the spins point along upward direction and the magnetic skyrmion disappears .",
    "this is possible since the system is on the lattice and such a transition never happens for the continuum system . in this process ,",
    "the spiral spin wave is generated , as seen obviously in the topological density as well as the energy density at @xmath45 ps in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",

    "the topological number jumps from @xmath6 to @xmath0 by making a large spin rotation in this lattice - scale area within a few picoseconds",
    ". this phenomenon would be viewed as an emergence of a bloch point in the continuum theory .",
    "second , a similar process occurs to make a jump from @xmath0 to @xmath2 .",
    "the dissipation spreads over the sample like a burst at the moment of the birth of a magnetic skyrmion .",
    "the continuity of the spin texture is recovered since a smooth texture has a lower energy .",
    "once a sufficiently smooth high - q skyrmion is generated , it remains stable even if we switch off the dmi or even if we change the current density of the injected spin current considerably .",
    "we have explained its stability as a topologically protected dissipative structure .    when the spin current injection is switched off ,",
    "the high - q skyrmion is destroyed .",
    "the destruction process occurs also in two steps as in the case of the nucleation process .",
    "however , the detailed mechanism is different .",
    "the first step occurs by way of a bloch point , where the continuum picture is still good . in the second step ,",
    "the lattice structure becomes important since the skyrmion size is so small , where the skyrmion spin texture turns into the vortex spin texture and disappears .",
    "the dissipation spreads over the sample like a burst at the moment of the destruction of a magnetic skyrmion .",
    "it is a hard problem to solve the nucleation or destruction process analytically since it is a highly nonlinear process involving bloch points .",
    "furthermore , the lattice structure plays a key role in these processes at the microscopic level .",
    "we hope this work provides useful guidelines in searching new type of skyrmions and will afford a new dimension towards fully understanding the nontrivial topology of magnetic skyrmions with higher topological numbers .",

    "<S> the magnetic skyrmion with the topological number of unity ( @xmath0 ) is a well - known nanometric swirling spin structure in the nonlinear @xmath1 model with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction . here , </S>",
    "<S> we show that magnetic skyrmion with the topological number of two ( @xmath2 ) can be created and stabilized by applying vertical spin - polarized current though it can not exist as a static stable excitation . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic skyrmion with @xmath2 is a nonequilibrium dynamic object , subsisting on a balance between the energy injection from the current and the energy dissipation by the gilbert damping . </S>",
    "<S> once it is created , it becomes a topologically protected object against fluctuations of various variables including the injected current itself . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we may call it a topologically protected dissipative structure . </S>",
