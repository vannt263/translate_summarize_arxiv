    "perhaps the most important realization of pioneering high - energy astronomy was that hot plasmas are found essentially everywhere in the universe .",
    "more and more detailed observations of thermal x - ray lines provide detailed and often unique information on a wide variety of astrophysical sites , including stellar environments , supernova explosions , accreting compact objects , interstellar and intergalactic media and active galactic nuclei .",
    "particle acceleration is believed to occur in most of these sites .",
    "our understanding of acceleration mechanisms should greatly benefit from the detection of lines produced through atomic and nuclear interactions of energetic particles with ambient matter .",
    "the sun provides valuable examples of these nonthermal radiation processes .",
    "the study of nuclear de - excitation lines produced in solar flares has now become a proper domain of solar physics .",
    "gamma - ray lines are also emitted in the decay of radioactive nuclei .",
    "measurements of gamma - ray activities from cosmic radionuclei testify to the ongoing synthesis of chemical elements and their isotopes in the galaxy and beyond .",
    "these observations are now cornerstones for models of nucleosynthesis in novae , supernovae and stellar interiors .",
    "positron - electron annihilation radiation is relevant to almost all of high - energy astrophysics .",
    "positrons can be produced by various pair - creation processes in relativistic plasmas , by accelerated particle interactions and by the @xmath0-decay of radioisotopes .",
    "observations of their annihilations offer a unique vision of high - energy accreting sources , nucleosynthesis sites and the global structure of the milky way .",
    "the aim of this text is to present the physical processes responsible for these various line emissions .",
    "i also consider emission processes which have not been observed with assurance yet : x - ray line production from accelerated particle interactions and from the decay of cosmic radioactivities , and gamma - ray line emission from thermonuclear plasmas .",
    "however , given the advent of new x - ray and gamma - ray satellites with unprecedented sensitivities and spectral resolutions ( see barret and kndlseder , this volume ) , i am optimistic that at least some of these emissions could be detected in the near future .",
    "the scope of this review is restricted to emission lines .",
    "in particular , i do not discuss x - ray absorption lines recently observed from a handful of active galactic nuclei , as well as cyclotron absorption features in intense magnetic fields , detected from several x - ray binaries . nor do i treat the high - energy gamma - ray emission from pion decay .    the plan of this review is the following : in section ",

    "i consider both the gamma - ray lines and the x - ray lines emitted by the decay of radioactive nuclei synthesized in stars ; finally , positron annihilation radiation is discussed in ",
    "thermal x - ray emission is observed from a great variety of sources in the universe ( see , e.g. , astronomy & astrophysics , volume 365 , for an overview of the recent _ xmm - newton _ observations ) . it is produced in various ion - electron plasmas , which can be first classified as a function of their optical depth in the x - ray energy range ( 0.1@xmath1@xmath2@xmath1100 kev ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the linear absorption coefficient ( in c.g.s .",
    "units of @xmath5 ) at photon energy @xmath2 and @xmath6 is the typical dimension of the emitting plasma ( cm ) is also called the _ extinction coefficient _ when it includes compton scattering of the x - rays against the free electrons ( e.g. rybicki & lightman @xcite ) . ] .",
    "optically thick sources ( @xmath7@xmath81 ) such as isolated neutron stars essentially emit blackbody radiation , with some possible discrete spectral structures due to complicated radiation transfer effects ( e.g. rajagopal & romani @xcite ) .",
    "optically thin sources include stellar coron , supernova remnants , superbubbles , the hot interstellar medium , clusters of galaxies and the intergalactic medium .",
    "the emission properties of such sources are usually discussed in terms of the _ coronal model _ , based on the pioneering attempt of elwert ( @xcite ) to explain the x - ray emission of the solar corona . in this model ,",
    "the plasma radiation is essentially due to collisions of thermal electrons with ions , but the mechanism for heating the electrons to temperature @xmath9 typically @xmath10  10@xmath11  k is not specified , i.e. @xmath9 is an external parameter of the model .",
    "different x - ray emitting plasmas are found in astrophysical objects such as x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei , in which a nebular gas of relatively high density can be strongly illuminated by the compact x - ray source .",
    "the physical state and radiation of such photoionized plasmas are generally assumed to be primarily controled by the emission of the compact source and are usually described in terms of the _ nebular model _ , which owes its name to the resemblance of these objects with planetary nebulae . in this section ,",
    "i briefly present the x - ray line production in the coronal model (   2.1 ) and in the nebular model (   2.2 ) and then discuss some diagnostics of plasma parameters based on high - resolution , x - ray line spectroscopy (   2.3 ) .",
    "the coronal model ( see mewe @xcite for a comprehensive description ) applies to an optically thin , tenuous , thermal plasma , in which ( i ) the electrons and the ions are relaxed to maxwellian energy distributions , ( ii ) the ions are essentially in their ground state , i.e. excited state configurations can generally be neglected for the calculation of the ionization balance and ( iii ) each x - ray photon emitted in a microscopic process does not further interact with the ambient ions and electrons .",
    "first order deviations from the coronal model are discussed in raymond ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ionization structure of each element of chemical symbol @xmath12 and atomic ( proton ) number @xmath13 is generally obtained by solving a set of @xmath13 + 1 coupled equations : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ionic fraction of ion @xmath16 ( @xmath17=1 ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( in c.g.s .",

    "ionizations are induced by thermal electron collisions .",
    "the ionization coefficient @xmath18 is obtained by averaging the collisional ionization cross section @xmath29 over the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath30 of the relative collision velocity , which is generally very close to the velocity distribution of the much lighter electrons : @xmath31 with @xmath32~,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath9 are the electron mass and temperature and @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the ionization cross sections are estimated from laboratory measurements combined with atomic physics theory ( in particular distorted wave calculations , e.g. younger @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "apart from direct ionization ( @xmath16+@xmath35@xmath22@xmath23 + 2@xmath35 ) , ion @xmath16 can be stripped of one bound electron through the two - step process of excitation - autoionization ( @xmath16+@xmath35@xmath22@xmath36+@xmath35@xmath22@xmath23 + 2@xmath35 ) , which is due to the collisional excitation of an _ inner - shell _ electron to a bound level above the first ionization threshold , followed by autoionization .",
    "the latter process is due to electron - electron interactions , which can break the compound excited state @xmath36 into its two components : ion @xmath23 and a free electron .",
    "the contribution of excitation - autoionization to the total ionization cross section is calculated from the sum over all possible autoionizing levels _ a _ of the collisional excitation cross sections @xmath37 , weighted by the autoionization probability of each excited state .",
    "recombination of a free electron can proceed either through a radiative free - bound transition ( @xmath23+@xmath35@xmath22@xmath16+@xmath38 ) or by a radiationless dielectronic recombination ( dr ) .",
    "charge - transfer reactions are generally negligible for the hot plasmas considered in the coronal model , but can be very important for photoionized plasmas (   2.2 ) . since radiative recombination ( rr ) is the inverse of photoionization , the rates of the two processes are connected through the principle of time - reversal invariance .",
    "the application of this principle by means of the detailed balance theorem leads to the milne equation ( milne @xcite ) , which is generally used to calculate rr rate coefficients from photoionization data ( an example of the use of the milne equation is provided in ",
    "2.2.2 ) .",
    "however , dr is often the dominant recombination process ( e.g. arnaud & rothenflug @xcite ) .",
    "it is schematically represented in figure  1 .",
    "the first step is a dielectronic capture ( dc ) , in which the energy lost by the plasma electron is expended in the simultaneous excitation of one of the bound electrons in the core of the recombining ion @xmath23 .",
    "the atomic level _",
    "a _ thus produced is said to be doubly - excited , because its configuration involves two electrons occupying subshells above those which they would occupy in the ground state configuration of ion @xmath16 .",
    "dc is the inverse of autoionization , so that the dc rates can be calculated from the autoionization rates , by applying the principle of detailed balancing .",
    "dr occurs if , instead of autoionizing , the doubly - excited state decays by a radiative transition to a level _ b _ below the first ionization limit ( fig .",
    "the stabilizing decay of the core electron produces a so - called _ satellite line _ , as it is slightly shifted , usually to the long - wavelength side of the corresponding transition in ion @xmath23 , due to the electrostatic shielding induced by the spectator outer electron .",
    "satellite line emission can provide very powerful diagnostics of plasma parameters (   2.3 ) .",
    "shown in figure  2 are the results of arnaud & raymond ( @xcite ) for the ionic fractions of fe at ionization equilibrium .",
    "we see that ions with closed - shell configurations are more stable than those with partially filled l or m shells .",
    "thus , he - like fe  xxv ( fe@xmath39 ) , ne - like fe  xvii ( fe@xmath40 ) and ar - like fe  ix ( fe@xmath41 ) , whose ground state configurations are 1@xmath42 , 2@xmath422@xmath43 and 3@xmath423@xmath43 respectively , are dominant in large temperature ranges , because their ionization and dr rates are relatively low compared to those of adjacent ions .      in the coronal model ,",
    "the line spectrum is dominated by radiative decays following electron impact excitation , plus a smaller contribution of recombination lines .",

    "this emission is considered in   2.2.2 .",

    "determinations of the precise energy and intensity of various lines thus provide direct information on the ionization structure of a coronal plasma .",
    "the nebular model ( e.g. kallman & mccray @xcite , liedahl @xcite ) is intended to describe the physical state and emission of a plasma illuminated by intense x - ray radiation .",
    "the most important applications of this model are accretion - powered x - ray sources : active galactic nuclei , x - ray binaries and cataclysmic variables . in these objects ,",
    "circumsource material is believed to intercept some of the radiation emitted from a compact region near the accreting source and to reprocess it into line and continuum emission in other portions of the spectrum .",
    "the main assumption of the nebular model is that the temperature and ionization structure of the illuminated gas are essentially governed by the interactions of the radiation field with the ion - electron plasma .",
    "possible additional heating sources , such as shocks or magnetic - field reconnection , are thus generally neglected .",
    "the temperature and ionization structure of a photoionized plasma are obviously intimately connected .",
    "for example , recombination of thermal electrons affects both the charge state distribution and the plasma cooling rate .",
    "thus , the state of the plasma has to be determined by solving a set of coupled equations describing the ionization balance together with the thermal equilibrium .",
    "most photoionized - plasma models which have been developed so far ( see ferland _",
    "_ @xcite and references therein ) assume that the ionization and energy balances are in a steady - state , i.e. that the time scales for variation in the compact source emission and in the plasma global parameters are long compared to the characteristic time scales for the atomic processes .",
    "the ionic fractions of adjacent charge states are then connected through a generalization of eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) , which obviously has to take into account the dominant process of photoionization , but also the possible contribution of charge - exchange reactions ( e.g. halpern & grindlay @xcite ) : @xmath96   = \\eta_z^{i+1 } \\cdot [ n_e\\alpha_{z^{+(i+1)}}(t ) + k^r_{z^{+(i+1)}}(t)]~.\\ ] ] here , @xmath97 is the photoionization rate ( in units of s@xmath21 ) , which depends on the flux of the illuminating radiation @xmath98 ( see below ) , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the effective ionization and recombination rates due to charge - transfer reactions ( also in s@xmath21 ) , which , for a gas of given composition and density , only depend on the ionic fractions of h and he , and on the plasma temperature @xmath101 .",
    "ionization by thermal electron impact ( of rate coefficient @xmath102 , ",
    "2.1.1 ) is often unimportant , because , contrary to coronal plasmas , the temperature of photoionized gas may not reach the ionization threshold energy of many ions .",
    "lower temperatures can also modify the relative contributions of dr and rr to the total recombination rate coefficient @xmath103 (   2.1.1 ) : in a photoionized plasma , radiationless dielectronic capture proceeds primarily through core excitations of relatively low energies , i.e. essentially transitions of core electrons to the same shell ( @xmath104=0 excitations , @xmath105 being the principal quantum number ) .",
    "thus , rr generally dominates the total recombination rate for h - like and he - like ions , since these species have no available @xmath104=0 excitations . on the other hand",
    ", dr can be the main recombination process for ions with partially filled l or m shells ( liedahl @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the photoionization rate @xmath97 is obtained by folding the radiation field with the corresponding photoionization cross section @xmath106 : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the ionization threshold energy of ion @xmath16 and @xmath109 is the net energy flux at the distance @xmath110 from the compact source ( in c.g.s units of erg s@xmath21 @xmath111 erg@xmath21 ) .",
    "for example , for an isotropic point source of total luminosity @xmath112 and spectrum @xmath113=@xmath112@xmath114 , assuming that the source radiation is not significantly attenuated by photoabsorption , the photoionization rate is simply given by @xmath115    however , photoionization is often enhanced by the emission of one or more auger electrons in addition to the original photoelectron .",
    "for example , photoionization of a k - shell electron in an ion having two or more l - shell electrons leaves the resulting ion in an _ autoionizing _ state that can decay by ejecting at least one l - shell electron .",
    "the l - shell vacancy thus produced can further be filled by an other radiationless auger transition if the ion has two or more m - shell electrons .",
    "this cascade process can lead to the ejection of up to eight auger electrons following the creation of a k - shell vacancy in neutral iron ( kaastra & mewe @xcite ) .",
    "thus , ionization balance calculations in the framework of the nebular model are generally complicated by the possible coupling of several charge states in each element ( weisheit @xcite ) .",
    "note that additional ionization can be produced by collisions of the fast ejected electrons with neighbouring ions ( halpern & grindlay @xcite ) . however ,",
    "if most of ambient h and he are ionized , these electrons will slow down primarily by elastic scattering with thermal electrons , thus depositing their energy as heat .",
    "charge - transfer reactions can be very important for the ionization structure of a photoionized plasma , if a significant abundance of neutral h or he atoms ( i.e. with neutral fraction typically exceeding @xmath860.01 ) coexists with ionized heavy elements .",
    "they are of the form @xmath116 where @xmath117@xmath91h or he and @xmath118 is the energy defect , which can be either a positive or a negative quantity depending on the reaction and on the atomic states involved in the electron transfer ( e.g. kingdon & ferland @xcite ) .",

    "the thermal balance can be established by calculating the rate of removal or addition of energy to the local radiation field associated with each of the processes affecting atomic level populations ( kallman & bautista @xcite ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare the line production in photoionized plasmas and in thermally ionized plasmas . in the coronal model ,",
    "the electron population responsible for the plasma ionization structure is also an efficient source of collisional line excitation . on the other hand ,",
    "a photoionized plasma is generally overionized relative to the electron temperature , since the thermal electrons are not the dominant source of ionization .",
    "collisional excitation is then often unimportant in the x - ray energy range and the line emission is preferentially due to recombination of relatively low - energy electrons and to photon - induced fluorescence .",
    "therefore , whereas in the coronal model , line production in ion @xmath16 is generally proportional to its ionic fraction @xmath15 ( eq .  2.6 ) , in the nebular model it is dominated by processes involving adjacent charge states : recombination of ion @xmath23 and inner - shell photoionization of ion @xmath24 .",
    "this difference allows to distinguish between coronal and nebular gas emission of cosmic origin by observing various line intensity ratios from the same element .",
    "for example , liedahl _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that the ( 3@xmath89@xmath222@xmath88)/(3@xmath130@xmath222@xmath88 ) line ratios from fe xvii - xix can be used to discriminate between thermally ionized and photoionized plasmas , because the 3@xmath130 lines are preferentially produced by electron impact excitation in a hot coronal plasma ( 5 - 10  mk , see fig .",
