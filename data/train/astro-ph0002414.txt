    "<S> when angular objects in lensing are considered as linear objects , interesting phenomena start happening . </S>",
    "<S> tachyonic caustics are one example . </S>",
    "<S> we review that the intrinsic variables of the lens equation are angular variables . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the  fast glance effect `` of a caustic curve that is far away from lenses does not share the physical bearing of the well - known ( apparent ) superluminal motion . </S>",
    "<S> there is no dbout that it would be a useful exercise to study the null geodesics in the metric of , say , a rapidly rotating black hole binary . </S>",

    "<S> authors claim that swapping @xmath1 and @xmath2 makes the time component ( @xmath3 ) of the lienard - wiechert potentials into ' ' the gravitational analog \" that governs the behavior of the null geodesics near a relativistic binary system seems to be unfounded .    </S>",
    "<S> ( )    it has been a long controversy in the smoky backroom where non - smoking jurors shred papers and throw verdicts , where the caustics are . </S>",
    "<S> the controversy hits home often because we are looking for bruno s planets . </S>",
    "<S> caustics matter greatly in the field of microlensing planet searches . </S>",
    "<S> we wrote in a paper on the discovery of evidence of a low mass planet @xcite that `` a single lens ( stellar lens only ) has a point caustic at the position of the lens . '' or , is the point caustic behind the position of the lens at the projected position of the lens ? </S>",
    "<S> may we draw the caustic curve and the critical curve in the same plane as we usually do ? </S>",
    "<S> is it a law or a rule that caustics ( onto which the critical curve in the image plane is mapped under the lens equation ) lie in the source plane ? or , </S>",
    "<S> is it a matter of definitions and conventions ? </S>",
    "<S> what is the image plane ? </S>",
    "<S> what is the source plane ? does any of them ( including what we wrote in the paper mentioned ) have any merit or physical relevance ? </S>",
    "<S> what is a superluminal caustic ? </S>",
    "<S> we realize that we just found in the phantom of tachyonic caustics an important clue to the mysterious misunderstanding behind the controversy . </S>",
    "<S> discoveries advance science . </S>",
    "<S> so does reasoning . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the misconception of superluminal caustics @xcite as an attempt to straighten out the wrinkles on caustics . </S>",
    "<S> we only need to borrow a pinch of salt from a way of thinking in science which may have been popularized by einstein :  gedenken experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> *     andrew gould writes in a recent article @xcite ( g1421 from here on ) that  the geometry of point - lens microlensing is so simple that students can derive all the basic results in a few hours . </S>",
    "<S> \" the abstract of g1421 starts with a paragraph ,  if the standard microlensing geometery is inverted so that the einstein ring is projected onto the observer plane rather the source plane , ... . \" what could be the source plane and the observer plane referred to as in g1421 ? in lensing , </S>",
    "<S> there are three basic objects , which we may refer to as  lensing trio \" in this article . </S>",
    "<S> they are radiation an emission source , a lensing object , and an observer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lensing trio fall more or less on a line in the radial direction , namely , the line of sight ( of the observer of the source star in the absence of the intervening lensing object ) . given a geometric line , </S>",
    "<S> one can imagine an infinitely many planes that are perpendicular to the line . </S>",
    "<S> one may refer to the plane that passes through the radiation emission source as the source plane and the plane that passes through the observer as the observer plane . </S>",
    "<S> where is the einstein ring ? </S>",
    "<S> equation ( 1 ) in g1421 indicates that the einstein ring lies on the plane that passes through the lensing object . </S>",
    "<S> zheng and gould ( 2000 ; zg1199 from here on ) refer to the plane through the lensing object as the lens plane .    </S>",
    "<S> physics lies in relations not in nomenclatures , and it will be most harmonious if the nomenclatures faithfully represent the relations . </S>",
    "<S> one of the governing relations in lensing is the so - called lens equation , and zg1199 writes the lens equation in terms of the variables defined on the aforementioned source plane and lens plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> = d_sd_1   - d_2  ( )  , [ eqzg11 ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the distances from the lens to the observer and to the source , and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> zg1199 describes the transverse ( or 2-d ) position variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 as follows : a photon comes from point @xmath7 in the source plane and hits point @xmath8 in the lens plane . at this point </S>",
    "<S> , one may wonder if @xmath7 must be the variable for the source position ( since it is said to be in the source plane ) and @xmath8 must be the variable for the lens position ( since it is said to be in the lens plane ) . in order to understand the significance of the variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a gendenken experiment : we reduce the mass @xmath9 gradually by taking away one atom at a time . </S>",
    "<S> a photon from point @xmath7 on the plane at a distance @xmath10 from the observer must hit point @xmath8 on the lens plane such that lens equation ( [ eqzg11 ] ) with decreasing mass @xmath11 is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> when the last atom is taken away , there is no lensing mass , and there is no lens plane . </S>",
    "<S> the plane at a distance @xmath4 from the observer is just one of the infinitely many planes that are perpendicular to the line of sight . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath4 retains its significance in equation ( [ eqzg11 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> when there is no lensing mass , @xmath12 vanishes , and the lens equation reads as follows . </S>",
    "<S> = d_sd_1   [ eqnolens ] since there is no lensing mass , the distance @xmath4 does not have any physical relevance and should not show up in equation ( [ eqnolens ] ) with any significance . </S>",
    "<S> but it does . </S>",
    "<S> we only know that that is where we used to have a lensing mass . </S>",
    "<S> is it some sort of hysteresis ? </S>",
    "<S> then , it could be where we are thinking of putting a lensing mass because we can start piling atoms the very next moment . </S>",
    "<S> then , of course , it could be just a plane we are thinking of for no reason , perhaps out of boredom . or , perhaps , @xmath8 is not a most representative variable for the governing equation of the lensing behavior . </S>",
    "<S> what equation ( [ eqnolens ] ) says is that the transverse vector @xmath7 on the source plane at a distance @xmath10 from the observer and the transverse vector @xmath8 on an arbitrary plane at a distance @xmath4 from the observer are parallel and scale with the distances from the observer . </S>",
    "<S> what should strike us by now is that the perspective of the observer , that is all there is in the lens equation with zero lens mass . </S>",
    "<S> so , we divide the transverse vectors by the distances of the planes , and it becomes very clear what the equation must mean . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath13 and @xmath14 , then = _ s  . </S>",
    "<S> [ eqalphazeromass ] a radiation source that would be seen at an angular position @xmath15 by an observer in a flat space is seen by the observer at an angular position @xmath16 that has the same value as @xmath15 when there is nothing to change the light ray from that in the minkowski space . </S>",
    "<S> then , it is clear that the pair of variables @xmath17 simply are not the proper pair of variables for the lens equation . </S>",
    "<S> it is not that one can not write the equation in terms of the variables @xmath17 , but that they oscure the conceptual underpinning of the lens equation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that the variable @xmath16 or @xmath18 is a variable for the positions of the images not the lenses . </S>",
    "<S> this fact seems to have generated another misconception that images should lie on the lens plane . </S>",
    "<S> this misconception seems to have produced a corollary that images can be in two different lens planes ( when the lensing involves double scattering ) as the audience was told by an invited speaker in a recent lensing meeting .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we put back in the lensing mass , say , at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the ( 2-d ) scattering angle @xmath12 is a function of a dimensionful constant @xmath2 as well as of @xmath8 :  @xmath19 , and it works out to be dimensionless as it should . </S>",
    "<S> so , we can divide equation ( [ eqzg11 ] ) by @xmath10 to write it in terms of the pair of angular variables @xmath16 and @xmath15 . = _ </S>",
    "<S> s + dd_1  , [ eqleqalpha ] where @xmath20 is the reduced distance = 1d_1 + 1d_2  . </S>",
    "<S> a radiation source that would be seen at an angular position @xmath15 by an observer in minkowski space is seen by the observer at an angular position @xmath16 which is shifted from @xmath15 by a fraction of the ( 2-d ) scattering angle @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced distance is no bigger than the smaller of @xmath4 and @xmath5 as is familiar from the reduced mass in mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath21 , and the angular shift between @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the equality holds when @xmath23 , which is not exactly a physical situation . </S>",
    "<S> that is because of the hidden assumption of the lens equation that the observer is supposed to be asymptotically far away from the lensing mass as it should be clear in the following section . )    </S>",
    "<S> an emblematic analogue to this interpreational issue of the lens equation hinging on  trivial math \" and  deeper physics \" would be the case of the cosmological constant which may have been the biggest blunder of the man of the 20th century ( time ) but likely a necessity for the millenials . as a desperate effort to stop the universe from expanding without introducing negative density or pressure , einstein modified his equations in 1917 and introduced a new fundamental constant , the so - called cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> the new equation read as follows @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> g _ - g _ </S>",
    "<S> = -8 g t _  , [ eqlambda ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are einstein and energy - momentum tensors , and @xmath26 is the metric tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the lhs is the geometry , the rhs is the matter content , and the einstein field equation tells us how the geometry of space time interacts with the content of the matter in the space time . </S>",
    "<S> what is curious about the cosmological term is that it does not vanish when the space time is flat . </S>",
    "<S> it is a blow to the fundamental notion of einstein gravity one might have just convinced oneself to accept :  gravitational interaction is an experience of the curvature of space time . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological term is a non - curvature term of the geometry that participates in governing the grvaity as it is written in the lhs of the gravitational field equation . </S>",
    "<S> we may consider the @xmath27-term as a part of the energy momentum tensor and write the gravitational field equation as follows . </S>",
    "<S> g _ </S>",
    "<S> = -8 g ( t _ - 8 g   g _ ) [ eqlambdavac ] the transition from equation ( [ eqlambda ] ) to equation ( [ eqlambdavac ] ) is less than trivial mathematically , but it requires a profound change in the frame of physical understanding . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27-term as an energy momentum tensor features negative pressure , which einstein axiomized to avoid and was one of the very reasons why he devised the @xmath27-term in equation ( [ eqlambda ] ) in the first place . </S>",
    "<S> it took developement of goldstone bosons , renormalization and brief marriage of particle physics and condensed matter physics , grand unification theories ( gut ) , experience of rich vaccuum structures ( with endless parade of scalar fields as yet to be discovered or refuted ) and phase transitions in the early universe , monopole problem , horizon problem , dark matter problem , inflation theories , structure seed problem , fine - tuning problems , topological defects , etc , for the negative pressure to find its natural position in human intellectural domain . </S>",
    "<S> now , no one doubts the physical relevance of the cosmological constant as the the vaccuum energy density  or the  zero point energy \" of the ( future ) quantum gravity , even though it is a good question how big it is , or whether it is a constant . in astrophysical practice </S>",
    "<S> , it is simply passed as a stuff with stiff equation of state : @xmath28 that can overcome the self - gravity of ordinary matter and make the universe fly apart . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , high - z supernovae searches have found evidence of accelerating universe @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so , we emphatically conclude that the intrinsic variables in lens equations in ( [ eqzg11 ] ) and ( [ eqleqalpha ] ) are angular variables . </S>",
    "<S> this obvious conclusion is self - evident from the beginning if we derive the lens equation of a point mass @xmath9 starting from the first principle ( simply following a standard textbook on general relativity ) . </S>",
    "<S> an equation that relates two angular variables , that is the first thing we get . </S>",
    "<S> the others are all simple derived quantities , and there is no misunderstanding of what is what . </S>",
    "<S> if it takes a few hours for students to do so as gould ( g1421 ) testifies , it should take less than a few days for practitioners to derive the lens equation and less than a few minutes to read one . </S>",
    "<S> so , we write out the derivation in the following section as an effort to abolish the ground for the mysterious understanding that seems to perpetuate even more mysterious controversies . in fact , it is cathartic to go through the derviation of the lens equation once . </S>",
    "<S> the einstein field equations are non - linear and can not be solved in general , but there are some exact solutions . and , the lens equation of a point mass is derived from one of those exact solutions , and that the simplest one ( despite the problem of no global time killing vector and of nontrivial topology ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is such a great assurance to be backed by an analytic derivation from an exact solution .    </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , one may realize that the source plane and the lens plane defined based on the positions of the source and the lens in radial direction ( or based on the distances of the source and the lens from the observer ) have no relevance with the variables in the lens equation . </S>",
    "<S> the lens equation can only address the relation between transverse position variables . </S>",
    "<S> then , one wonders why these objects play such a persistent role in the volitational papers and caustics .    </S>",
    "<S> let s pause for a moment and ponder angular variables . </S>",
    "<S> what is it that we perceive and measure as the angular position of a celestial object ? </S>",
    "<S> speckle imaging may offer the best food for thought . </S>",
    "<S> the space time dependent refraction index makes a photon beam from a celestial object wiggle along through the atmosphere , and the object appears to hop around as registered at the focal plane . </S>",
    "<S> we may refer to these snap shots as a time series of  apparent angular positions `` of the object . if we remove the atmospheric turbulence or the atmosphere altogether ( again in our thought experiment )  assuming that that leaves only the vacuum for the photon beam to propagate through , we will find a steady image on our ccd </S>",
    "<S> . we may refer to it as the ' ' true angular position \" of the object . </S>",
    "<S> what is common for both  </S>",
    "<S> apparent \" and  true \" angular positions is that an angular position is determined by the direciton of the propagation vector of the photon beam at the observer . </S>",
    "<S> the space time dependent refraction index of the atmosphere is an electromagnetic property of a matter in hydrodynamic motion . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , there is nothing wrong with understanding gravitational lensing effect of the space time curvature in terms of effective refraction index ( continuous function in space and time ) assuming that we calculate the index truthfully to the underlying physics . that is , according to general relativity , not in terms of ferma theorem @xcite unsubstantiated for the gravitational effect on optical paths ( no historians have found evdience of a margin the lack thereof prevented ferma from elaborating riemannian geometry and propagation of massless spin one particles ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let s consider a quasar lens . </S>",
    "<S> there are four objects that are believed to be all from the same emission source qso 2237 + 0305 , and they are called huchra s lens , einstein cross , or qso 2237 + 0305 . </S>",
    "<S> the emission source qso 2237 + 0305 is at a cosmological distance @xmath29 , and it will be a long time before the lensing galaxy moves away from the line of sight of the qso even though the ( sb ) galaxy is relatively close to us at @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the four objects are the thing that will be recognized as qso 2237 + 0305 for generations to come , but we always can remove the lensing galaxy in our thought experiment . then , an observer will see one object , say , at an angular position @xmath15 , which one may refer to as the  true angular position \" of the quasar . in a consistent manner , one might have liked to refer to the angular positions of the four objects as the  apparent angular positions \" of the quasar , but the multiplicity of the objects renders such practice seem unfit . </S>",
    "<S> the four objects can represnt the different facets of the lensed quasar , and they are usually referred to as the  images \" of the quasar . </S>",
    "<S> so , the angular positions of the four objects may be referred to as the  angular positions of the images \" of the quasar or simply the  image positions \" . </S>",
    "<S> this practice is in perfect harmony with our everyday experience . </S>",
    "<S> a client in a barber chair next to a corner with mirrored walls can see multiple  images \" of oneself while being oblivious to the true object , oneself . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the images show the different sides of the client . </S>",
    "<S> so , we are all content to call the four objects the images of the quasar . </S>",
    "<S> now , we repeat our favorite thought experiment and reduce the mass of the lensing galaxy to zero . </S>",
    "<S> an observer will see one image of the quasar . what should we call this image ? </S>",
    "<S> preimage ? </S>",
    "<S> unlensed image ? </S>",
    "<S> image - sub - zero ( image@xmath31 : the image one sees when the lensing mass vanishes ) ? </S>",
    "<S> instead , this particular image is usually referred to as the  source \" . </S>",
    "<S> then , the  true angular position \" of the quasar @xmath15 may be referred to as the  angular source position \" or simply the  source position \" , and equation ( [ eqalphazeromass ] ) may read in english as follows : the image position of an object is the same as the source position of the object when there is no lensing mass . </S>",
    "<S> so , @xmath16 we introduced as the equivalent of @xmath32 is the variable for the image positions . </S>",
    "<S> when we put back in the lensing galaxy , the image positions may differ from the source position , and their relation is nothing but the lens equation ( [ eqleqalpha ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main games in quasar lensing ( or any large scale lensing ) is to reconstruct @xmath15 and @xmath12 from observational information of the images @xmath16 .    in quasar lensing , </S>",
    "<S> the distance ( actually the redshift ) to the emission source is one of the better determined quantities . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> one may favor @xcite to write the lens equation in terms of linear variables by multiplying the equation ( [ eqleqalpha ] ) by the distance to the source @xmath10 ( assumed to be determined from the measured redshift and the cosmology to be determined ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( d_s _ s ) = ( d_s ) - dd_1 ( d_s ) [ eqleqds ] in the case of qso 2237 + 0305 , the variables ( @xmath33 ) and ( @xmath34 ) may be considered to be defined on the plane at @xmath29 from the observer . </S>",
    "<S> ( the equivalence between angular variables and linear variables holds valid in a small scattering angle approximation , @xmath35 , which we assume to be the case in this article . </S>",
    "<S> the angular separations of the four objects in qso 2237 + 0305 is about @xmath36  . ) </S>",
    "<S> one may refer to the plane at @xmath29 as the source plane , as in g1421 ( and references therein ) , and consider ( @xmath33 ) and ( @xmath34 ) as the linear variables projected into the source plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , the variable @xmath37 denotes the source position in the source plane , and the variable @xmath38 denotes an image position in the source plane . if one feels a bit of cluttered tautology here , one may realize that the culprit is the clinging desire to recognize the quasar in full three - dimensional coordiantes of the space . </S>",
    "<S> the source position has been assigned three coordiantes : @xmath39 , and so has been the position of the . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the images lie on the source plane here . </S>",
    "<S> we mentioned before that some practioners insist on putting images on the lens plane ( or even lens planes ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the source plane here is tied to the value of the third ( or radial ) coordinates @xmath10 in @xmath39 and @xmath40 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath41 spans a two - dimensional plane , and one may prefer to refer to the plane as the source plane because the plane is parameterized by the source position variable . </S>",
    "<S> the two source planes coincide and there does nt seem to be any conflict between the two definitions . </S>",
    "<S> that is , until one realizes that @xmath42 also spans a two - dimensional plane , and one may prefer to refer to the plane as the image plane because the plane is parameterized by the image position variable . </S>",
    "<S> so , we find ourselves in the middle of a luxury of definitions that seem to be tangled in redundancy : the source plane originally defined by the distance of the emission source at @xmath10 and parameterized by the ( 2-d ) source position variable may be preferred to be referred to as the source plane , and the source plane originally defined by the distance of the emission source at @xmath10 and parameterized by the ( 2-d ) image position variable may be preferred to be referred to as the image plane .    lens equation is a relation of two diemensional variables and can accommodate only two dimensional angular variables or corresponding two dimensional linear variables . </S>",
    "<S> even when one carries around the third ( radial ) components , the degrees of freedom in the lens equation is only two dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> one can choose a plane that may represent the angular space faithfully with an understooding that any plane is as good as any other plane . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 one may choose the plane at a unit distance , at @xmath10 , or at an arbitrary distance @xmath44 from the observer . </S>",
    "<S> they are all equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering angle is a quantity defined on an optical path  a one - dimensional object in space . </S>",
    "<S> lensing is defined on the space of optical paths , which one as an observer recognizes only at one end of the paths . </S>",
    "<S> once a plane is chosen , that is where all the lensing variables will be defined and compared . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is best to consider the chosen plane as the  abstract plane \" which may be parameterized by the source position variable or the image position variable . </S>",
    "<S> we may prefer to refer to the  abstract plane \" as the  abstract lens plane \" or simply the  lens plane \" because that is where the lens equation is defined and studied . </S>",
    "<S> one may refer to the  abstract lens plane \" parameterized by the source position variable as the source plane and the  abstract lens plane \" parameterized by the image position variable as the image plane . </S>",
    "<S> so , the lens equation is a mapping from the  abstract lens plane \" to itself , or from the image plane to the source plane . </S>",
    "<S> ( d__s ) = ( d _ ) - dd_1 ( d _ ) [ eqleqdxi ]    when @xmath45 , the  abstract lens plane \" coincides with the lens plane defined by the radial position of the lensing object as in g1421 and zg1199 ( and references therein ) . as we will see in the following section , </S>",
    "<S> the distance from the lensing mass of the apastron of an optical path around a lensing mass is the same as the einstein ring radius on the plane at @xmath4 ( in the approximation of linear gravity which is valid for all the observed and identified gravitational lenses ) . </S>",
    "<S> einstein ring refers to a ring image ( as well as the critical curve ) in a point mass lens , and there seems to be a ( wrongful ) religious belief among some practitioners that the plane at @xmath4 is endowed with a privileged position as the image plane . </S>",
    "<S> that is not so , contrary to what one may find in g1421 and zg1199 . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed baffling to hear as recently as july 1999 a claim @xcite that images can be in two different lens planes . </S>",
    "<S> an observer does not see the photons in the images until they arrive at the observer as we have discussed repeatedly . </S>",
    "<S> there is only one plane one may define : the  abstract lens plane \" , the representation of the observer s sky  the motherboard of both the image plane and source plane . </S>",
    "<S> one can put the  abstract lens plane \" anywhere one finds it useful as far as the smallness of the scattering gurantees linearity between the plane and the sky .    the critical curve and the caustic curve pertain to the differential beahvior of the lens equation . </S>",
    "<S> the lens equation is an explicit mapping from an image position to its source position , and there are multiple solutions for a given source position . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity can change from domain to domain of the source plane , and all these interesting behavior can be studied starting from differentiating the lens equation . </S>",
    "<S> d _ s = d - dd_1 d d   d [ eqdiff ] when one of the ( never both in microlensing we are interested in ) eigenvalues of this linear transformation , @xmath46 , vanishes , the lens equation is said to be stationary along the eigendirection . </S>",
    "<S> the set of the points where the eigenvalue vanishes is called the critical curve . </S>",
    "<S> this is a benign or natural generalization of what is familiar from a real function , say , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> critical points are where @xmath48 ( or f(x ) is not differentiable ) . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes , we may hear `` critical line '' in relation to lensing . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the set of critical points almost always form closed smooth curves in lensing . </S>",
    "<S> ( one can assign lensing objects at infinity and force the critical curve to have an open curve , whose physical relevance i am not certain of . ) also ,  critical line \" may be best left as the terminology for the loci of the zeros of the riemann zeta funcion . </S>",
    "<S> ( the zeros are believed to be on the  line \" whose real value is 1/2 , and this riemann conjecture remains to be a conjecture despite the telegram sent by hilbert claiming otherwise . ) thus , we prefer to call the set of critical points of the lens equation the critical curve . the critical curve may be a disjoint sum of closed curves . </S>",
    "<S> one may wonder what happens to the critical curve under the mapping of the lens equation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting curve is called the caustic curve . </S>",
    "<S> the caustic curve has the same connectedness as the critical curve because the lens equation is continuous ( actually smooth ) in the neighborhood of the critical curve . </S>",
    "<S> continuity is preserved under a continuous mapping . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , i have no idea idea why the caustic curve is named as it is , even though they look punky all right with spiky cusps . in crc consise encyclopedia of mathematics </S>",
    "<S> , caustics are defined as involutes , and involution vaguely reminds me of the way light rays pile up on the glittering surface of a swimming pool on a bright day . </S>",
    "<S> caustic curves i encounter in microlensing are all  some - form - of - oids \" similar to cycloids : smooth closed curves punctuated by cusps . </S>",
    "<S> cusps occur because the lens equation has stationary points along the critical curve . </S>",
    "<S> a household name example of cusps may be the highest points in the swinging of a pendulum . </S>",

    "<S> the images have negative parity . </S>",
    "<S> there are usually three images in a binary lens , and the corresponding image trajectories are the one at the bottom of the plot converging to @xmath107 ( positive ) and the two outside the small critical loop converging to the lens positions . since @xmath106 is inside a caustic loop , we expect two more images while the source trajectory remains inside the caustic loop . </S>",

    "<S> this means that all the images but the image near the source become only nominal images , and that is reflected on the off - axis caustics moving away from the lens axis inversely proportional to the separation @xmath108 ( see equation ( [ eqtriposition ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , the sizes of the critical loops and caustic loops shrink as @xmath108 shrinks . </S>",
    "<S> what it means is that the lensing elements are so close to each other that the binary lens behave more or less as a single lens . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that @xmath109 as in zg1199 , the caustic in the lower half - plane will be at @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> the microlensing amplitude of a single lens of a source at a distance of 9.95 ( in einstein ring radius unit ) from the lens is 1.000196 . </S>",

    "<S> the critical curves are always closed curves , and the lens equation is always subcritical even when one includes dispersed medium of galactic particle dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence is that the caustic curves are smooth closed curves punctuated by ( spiky outward ) cusps , or simply , hypocycloids . </S>",
    "<S> there is no 1-cusped hypocycloid or 2-cusped hypocycloid . </S>",
    "<S> after consulting the 2000-page reference , we may still feel in jeopardy how to extend the naming tradition of  -oid s \" . or , is it  </S>",

    "<S> the confusion between  -oid \" and  -id \" can arise from that a 3-cusped hypocycloid is called a  tricuspoid \" , and a 4-cusped hypocycloid is called a  tetracuspid \" according to crc . considering that a 4-cusped hypocycloid is most commonly referred to as an  astroid \" not  tetracuspid \" </S>",

    "<S> the suffix  -cuspid \" seems to mean  pointed \" . </S>",

    "<S> let s consider epicycle and epicycloid to differentiate the two . </S>",
    "<S> an epicycle depicts a circular motion of an object around a center that moves along a larger circle , and the curve is smooth everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> an epicylcoid depicts a cicrular motion of an object around the smaller circle that rolls on the larger circle , and the curve is smooth except at the cusps ( the winding number is determined by the ratio of the two circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to be clear that  -oid \" in  -oid \" objects we discussed so far represents a particular resemblance to a cycle : curved and smooth like a circle but punctuated with points where the tangent flips its sign . in a binary lens , they are also simply closed curves . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is very clear that the number of cusps and the number of the smooth segments ( or  sides \" ) of a caustic loop are the same , and it is sufficient to assign a number to specify the particular  -oid \" . in a higher multiple point lens , a caustic loop can have winding number larger than 1 . however , the winding number is a finite integer , and the number of vertices ( or cusps ) and the number of sides ( or smooth segments ) are the same . </S>",
    "<S> the caustic curve of a gravitational binary lens consists of one hexoid , two quadroids , or , one quadroid and two trioids .    </S>",

    "<S> we may draw the critical curve and caustic curve on the same ( abstract ) lens plane as we did in figure ( [ fig - caustic ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lens equation is a mapping from the chosen ( abstract ) lens plane to itself , or a mapping from the image plane to the source plane where the image plane refers to the ( abstract ) lens plane parameterized by the image position variable and the source plane refers to the ( abstract ) lens plane parameterized by the source position variable .    now , is it confusing to call @xmath10-plane ( the plane defined by the radial position of the radiation emission source ) the source plane ? </S>",
    "<S> having understood that we only need to define one space ( angular space ) or a plane that corresponds to the angular space , it does nt seem to matter whatever the plane may be called . </S>",
    "<S> once we know clearly what degrees of freedom we are manipulating through the lens equation , it does nt seem to be a confusing practice to let the beloved term  source plane \" be used in both ways : based on the radial coordinate or based on the transverse coordinates . </S>",

    "<S> is it a law or a rule that the caustic curve lies on the source plane ? we may choose to call the plane parameterized by the source position variable @xmath124 the @xmath124-plane , perhaps from boredom or from a courtesy to leave the term  source plane \" for the practitioners who are attatched to the radial coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> then , the caustic curve will lie on the @xmath124-plane . </S>",
    "<S> so , it may constitute a proper question to ask if it is a law or a rule , and no paper should be shredded over this unsubstantiated dogma on wording .    </S>",
    "<S> are newcomers to the field confused by the confusing usage of terminologies as gould claims ? perhaps , not . </S>",
    "<S> we find it an unsubstantiated claim . </S>",
    "<S> considering the suggestion of superluminal caustics , we would think that the proper route to resolve any confustion is for students to take a bit more than a few hours to understand lensing from first principles . </S>",

    "<S> when the velocity of the system becomes comparable to the speed of light , the space - like components of the fields become comparable to the time - like components . and , a novelty one may witness ( as a student ) from playing with the lienard - wiechert potentials is to see the electromagnetic wave propagate and actually carry the energy out to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> if we only pick out the time - component @xmath3 , we will be at a loss with the discrepancies with the measurements of the electric and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> einstein field equations tell us how gravitational fields ( or metric ) and matter interact . when the velocity of the system becomes comparable to the speed of light </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that one should examine not only the time - time component ( @xmath125 ) but also the other five components of the metric . </S>",
    "<S> we find it a baffling practice for zg1199 to declare without substantiation that  retarding the newtonian potential \" ( with additional factor 2 mentioned above ) results in the  gravitational analog \" that governs the behavior of the null geodesics as seen by an observer . </S>",
    "<S> we have no doubt that it will take a bit more than a few hours to examine the metric even at the post newtonian level . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find it a worthy exercise to be carried out . </S>"
