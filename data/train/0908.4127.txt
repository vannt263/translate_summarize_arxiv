    "for thermal relic dark matter ( dm ) , the self - annihilation cross section must be @xmath2 @xmath3 s@xmath4 to obtain the observed relic abundance .",
    "there are a number of ways in which the self - annihilation rate can be enhanced e.g. , @xcite , while non - thermal relic dm may allow larger values for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "self - annihilation can lead to indirect detection of dm through observation of the annihilation products .",
    "we constrain the self - annihilation cross section by considering the gamma rays produced via dm annihilation to a number of final states .",
    "we first focus on annihilation to a pair of monenergetic gamma rays .",
    "this annihilation channel has a very clean signature , with @xmath6 , and future observation of such a line could provide clear evidence for the dm mass .",
    "we compare the calculated signal with gamma - ray observations of the galactic center , andromeda ( m31 ) , and the cosmic background , and place upper limits on the partial self - annihilation cross section , @xmath0 .",
    "our limits cover a broad dm mass range , from 20 kev up to 10 tev .",
    "we show our constraints are applicable even if dm annihilates to a broader spectrum of gamma rays , in general constraining the total annihilation cross section . with a conservative choice for the branching ratio , @xmath7",
    ", we constrain the _ total _ annihilation cross section , @xmath8 .",
    "next we place constraints on the self - annihilation cross section to an electron - positron pair , @xmath1 .",
    "these particles will inevitably be accompanied by gamma rays through a process known as _ internal bremsstrahlung _",
    "( ib ) or _ final state radiation_. this is the emission of a gamma - ray from one of the final state charged particles , occurring at the feynman diagram level .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "we use these gamma rays to constrain @xmath1 by again comparing the calculated annihilation signal with the observed gamma - ray flux .",
    "we place corresponding constraints on annihilation to the other charged leptons .",
    "the ib gamma - ray spectrum per annihilation does not depend on the tree level cross section , so our analysis remains dm model independent . because emission occurs at the feynman diagram level , the gamma - ray flux from ib remains independent of uncertain astrophysical phenomenon such as the interstellar magnetic field or radiation field .",
    "the @xmath9 final state is especially interesting in light of the recent pamela / atic/ fermi results suggesting an excess in the observed positron flux .",
    "there are now numerous dm models that can explain these results , many with a large branching ratio to charged leptons , e.g. @xcite .",
    "our limits on @xmath10 directly constrain many models attempting to explain the positron excess .",
    "we show how our results depend on the astrophysical uncertainties in the dm density profile .",
    "we are conservative in our analysis methods and input choices , and show how our results would be strengthened by more optimistic choices .",
    "we compare our constraints with pre - existing bounds on the total annihilation cross section .",
    "we find that our constraints on @xmath11 are particularly strong for small dm masses , while our constraints on @xmath12 are stronger than those on @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath13 , as expected from the @xmath14 suppression of the radiative corrections .",
    "our analysis and results are described in detail in mack _ et al .",
    "the flux of gamma rays from dm annihilation in our halo is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gamma - ray spectrum per annihilation , @xmath18 is the field of view in steradians , and    @xmath19    is proportional to the dark matter density squared , integrated over the line of sight . for annihilation to a gamma - ray pair ,",
    "the spectrum per annihilation is simply @xmath20 .",
    "we collect gamma - ray flux data from a variety of sources , covering a large range of energies .",
    "we compare the calculated annihilation flux with the observed flux , integrating each over an energy bin of equal size , and find an upper limit on @xmath21 by demanding that the annihilation flux be smaller than the entire observed flux .",
    "this is extremely conservative , as in reality , the dm annihilation flux would only be a small fraction of the observed flux .",
    "we focus on the galactic center flux , using data from comptel and egret aboard the cgro @xcite , integral @xcite , and h.e.s.s .",
    "we also look at gamma rays arising from annihilation in the m31 ( andromeda ) galaxy , and from cosmic annihilation , using the methods described in mack _ et al .",
    "we use m31 data from egret , celeste @xcite and hegra @xcite , and diffuse cosmic flux data from integral , comptel , egret and the solar maximum mission @xcite .",
    "we place constraints on @xmath22 , for both the conservative kravtsov @xcite and the commonly - adopted nfw dm density profile @xcite , over an energy range spanning 20 kev to 10 tev .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmagg - fig2 ] .    , derived from the various gamma - ray data",

    "for comparison , the light - shaded region shows the corresponding limits for the nfw ( rather than the kravtsov ) profile.,width=312 ]    to find a constraint on the total cross section , we need the branching ratio to this final state .",
    "typical branching ratios are @xmath23 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmagg - fig3 ] we show our upper bound on @xmath24 using a conservative choice of @xmath7 . in this plot",

    "the kkt and unitarity bounds are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .     as a conservative value .",
    "the unitarity and kkt bounds are also shown .",
    "the overall bound on the total cross section at a given mass is determined by the strongest of the various upper limits.,width=312 ]    most of these experiments had modest energy resolution . to be conservative ,",
    "we assume an analysis bin with a logarithmic energy width of 0.4 in @xmath25 ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) for the galactic and cosmic diffuse analyses ; this is at least as wide as the energy bins reported by the experiments . in effect , our results are what one would obtain for an annihilation gamma - ray spectrum as wide as 0.4 in @xmath25 .",
    "the exception is the integral line search .",
    "for annihilation to an @xmath9 pair , we follow a similar method to that outlined above .",
    "we constrain @xmath10 by demanding that the calculated gamma - ray signal from ib emission not exceed the entire observed gamma - ray flux .",
    "our analysis and results are described in detail in bell and jacques @xcite .",
    "the ib gamma - ray spectrum per annihilation is @xmath27 where @xmath28\\bigg[1+\\bigg ( \\frac{4m_\\chi(m_\\chi - e_\\gamma)}{4m_\\chi^2}\\bigg)^2\\bigg ] , \\label{sigbrem}\\ ] ] and @xmath29 is the tree - level cross section for annihilation to @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath29 factors out from the ib cross - section .",
    "this important feature implies that the ib spectrum is independent of the unknown physics which mediates the lowest order annihilation process .",
    "[ spectra ] shows @xmath30 for ib emission for a number of dm masses .",

    "[ spectra ] shows that @xmath17 falls with energy .",
    "however , the observed gamma - ray flux falls with energy at a steeper rate , so that the strongest results are obtained by choosing an analysis bin with the dm mass as the upper energy limit .     as a function of dm mass for the kravtsov ( solid ) , nfw ( dashed ) and moore ( dot - dashed ) profiles.,width=336 ]    in fig .",
    "[ results1 ] we show the upper limits on @xmath32 as a function of dm mass , using the observational data described above .",

    "we show the celeste constraint using only the kravtsov profile .    in fig .",
    "[ results2 ] we show the upper bounds on the annihilation cross sections into @xmath9 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , based upon the ib emission from each final state ( all use the conservative kravtsov profile ) . for annihilation to @xmath34 , we do not take into account gamma rays arising from the hadronic decay modes . including this",
    "would strengthen our bounds . for comparison , we also show limits on @xmath35 discussed in the previous section , as well as some earlier bounds on @xmath21 . for full details",

    "also shown are the kkt ( thin dashed ) and unitarity ( thin dot - dashed ) limits on the total cross section described in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the cross section for thermal relic dm ( natural scale ) .",
    "the @xmath38 limits are taken from ref .",
    "while the kravtsov , nfw and moore profiles diverge towards the center of the galaxy , they are similar at large radii . as the integral , egret and comptel observations encompass relatively large angular scales , the density profile changes have a modest effect . on the other hand , the h.e.s.s .",
    "constraints correspond to a much smaller angular region toward the galactic center , and vary by orders of magnitude depending on the profile adopted .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a full discussion of the differences between the profiles for different angular regions . )",
    "if dm annihilates to @xmath39 , photons will be produced not only by ib , but also by energy loss processes including inverse compton scattering and synchrotron radiation .",
    "however , the intensity of these signals depend on uncertain astrophysical parameters , such as magnetic field strength , radiation field intensities , and electron diffusion scales .",
    "by contrast , ib is free of these astrophysical uncertainties , and has a fixed spectrum and normalization .",
    "another key difference is the energy of the photons .",
    "synchrotron radiation produces generally low energy photons , while ib provides some hard gamma rays near the endpoint .",
    "since the background flux falls off with energy , these hard gamma rays are extremely useful .",
    "the sharp edge in the ib spectrum at @xmath40 can be used to diagnose the dm mass ; this is not possible with synchrotron radiation",
    ".    refs .",
    "@xcite and others have recently proposed models in which dm annihilates directly to charged leptons , with cross sections well above that expected for a thermal relic .",
    "this may account for anomalies in cosmic ray spectra from pamela , atic and fermi , and microwave signals from wmap , all of which seem to require more electrons and positrons than can be explained otherwise . our bounds on @xmath41 will directly constrain the allowed parameter space for these types of dm models .",
