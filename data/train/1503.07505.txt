    "the cochlea or inner ear is a fluid - filled , spiral - wound cavity that is the central source of frequency selectivity in the hearing system of humans and many other animals .",
    "the cochlea is divided on its primary axis into two main fluid chambers , the scala tympani and scala vestibuli , by a structure known as the cochlear partition ( cp ) .",
    "the cp itself consists of an elastic membrane known as the basilar membrane ( bm ) , on top of which is mounted the organ of corti containing the mechanosensitive hair cells that are the primary sensory receptors in the ear .",
    "figure  [ fig : wiki - cochlea ] contains a picture of an unwound cochlea with a simplified view of the cp showing only the bm .",
    "sound vibrations entering the outer ear are transferred to the cochlear duct and bm by the stapes , and then propagate from base to apex along the bm and the surrounding fluid .",
    "the bm has a fine frequency tuning ability that distinguishes between different frequencies by localizing the peak amplitude of incident travelling waves .",
    "this `` place theory '' was developed and validated experimentally by von  bksy  @xcite and shows that the peak location is closer to the base for high frequencies and to the apex for low frequencies , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : wiki - cochlea ] .",
    "a second defining feature of the cochlea , which sets it apart from other sensory receptors , is its ability to amplify extremely weak sound signals that would otherwise be immediately damped out due to viscous dissipation in the cochlear fluid .",
    "many authors have attributed this amplification ability to some active process related to resonance , which experiments have connected with mechanical properties of various structures making up the cp  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the outer hair cells in the organ of corti are stimulated by bm deflections caused by pressure waves travelling through the cochlear fluid .",
    "the hair cell stimulation leads to either _",
    "somatic motility _ , wherein the hair cell changes its length in response to electrical signals induced when the hair bundle on its tip is deflected ; or _ active hair bundle motility _ in which the hair bundle itself generates additional forces that initiate a shearing action between the bm and the overlying tectorial membrane .",
    "both of these effects are believed to contribute to the cochlear active process , but there is still no consensus in the literature regarding the precise cause of amplification  @xcite .",
    "many mathematical and computational models of the cochlea have appeared since the seminal work of von  bksy  @xcite .",
    "the earliest two - dimensional models of the cochlea describe the bm as a collection of damped mass - spring systems and also reduce the fluid dynamics to a simple linear potential flow  @xcite .",
    "the spring constant decreases exponentially along the bm from base to apex , which coincides with bm stiffness values measured in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the bm is treated as a passive structure to which is applied a sinusoidal external forcing term that mimics the input of sound energy from the stapes .",
    "these models give predictions of bm dynamics that agree qualitatively with the behaviours observed by von  bksy .",
    "inselberg and chadwick  @xcite proposed a similar model in which the bm is represented as an euler - bernoulli beam , and showed not only that the place principle still holds but also that fluid viscosity is required to obtain travelling wave solutions along the bm as opposed to simply standing waves  @xcite .",
    "pozrikidis  @xcite revisited this last approach by replacing the sinusoidal stapes motion with a point source at the stapes position and a point sink at the round window , and then solving the resulting equations using a boundary integral method .",
    "another noteworthy class of models based on transmission line equations was introduced in the pioneering work of zweig  @xcite and de  boer  @xcite and has since been applied in many more recent studies such as  @xcite .    to obtain a more realistic model of the fluid dynamics in the cochlea as well as the hydrodynamic interactions between the fluid and bm ,",
    "several authors have exploited the immersed boundary ( or ib ) method .",
    "the ib method was originally developed by peskin to simulate blood flow in the beating heart  @xcite and has since been applied to many problems in biofluid dynamics , including the cochlea .",
    "leveque et al .",
    "@xcite employed an ib model in which the fluid obeys the linearized stokes equations and the elasticity of the cochlea is treated using simple elastic springs .",
    "they derived an asymptotic solution for travelling waves along the bm , from which they drew conclusions regarding the effects of fluid viscosity on these waves .",
    "beyer and leveque  @xcite performed numerical simulations of a related ib model , with the primary difference being that their fluid obeys the full ( nonlinear ) navier - stokes equations .",
    "all of the aforementioned immersed boundary models approximate the geometry of the cochlea and bm by a straight ( uncoiled ) configuration .",
    "although the curvature of the cochlear duct has a relatively small influence on the fluid dynamics  @xcite , there is nonetheless some evidence to suggest that within the most tightly coiled apical region of the bm that is stimulated by the lowest frequency sounds , curvature can not be ignored  @xcite . to this end ,",
    "a much more detailed ib model capturing the full 3d geometry of the cochlea was developed in  @xcite that reproduced important features of bm dynamics .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use the ib method to investigate possible resonant phenomena that contribute to mechanical amplification of basilar membrane oscillations in the cochlea .",
    "our study is inspired by three main observations : first , direct experimental evidence that outer hair cells embedded within the organ of corti in the cp undergo periodic contractions when the ear is stimulated by sound waves  @xcite ; second , the suggestion by several authors that these hair cell contractions can in turn modulate the stiffness in the bm  @xcite which we take as an assumption ; and third , the analytical results of cortez et al .",
    "@xcite that uncovered parametric instabilities arising from the fluid - structure interaction in internally - forced immersed boundaries with a time - varying stiffness parameter . taken together , these three observations suggest that there is merit in investigating the hypothesis that internal forcing in the basilar membrane due to sound stimulation can engender parametric resonance in an ib model of the cochlea .",
    "one of the main contributions of this work is to extend the previous parametric resonance analysis for an elastic membrane with a periodically - varying stiffness parameter  @xcite to the case where stiffness depends on both time and space .",
    "our results may also contribute new insights into the understanding of fine - frequency tuning and amplification in the cochlea since many previous cochlea models ( described above ) treat the outer hair cell contractions as an external forcing , over - simplify the fluid mechanics , and/or ignore the fluid - structure interaction .",
    "for example , it is common for papers to question the ability of linked mechanical oscillator models to capture cochlear amplification by arguing that damping due to viscosity of the cochlear fluid is simply too large  @xcite .",
    "this argument is valid if the active process driving the cochlea appears as an external forcing in the model , but not when the force acts internally through a parameter  in the latter case , parametric resonance can occur in which large amplitude oscillations ( unbounded in the idealized linear case ) arise even in the presence of damping  @xcite . finally , we draw a distinction between our approach and other models incorporating resonance effects that act _ locally _ , such as the transmission line models based on coupled mechanical oscillators where each line element resonates individually . in contrast , our model exhibits _ global resonance _ owing to the non - local nature of the coupling between the bm and the surrounding fluid .",
    "following the ib cochlea model derived by peskin in  @xcite and developed in more detail in  @xcite , we consider a simple 2d geometry pictured in figure  [ fig : setup ] in which the cochlear duct of length @xmath0 is treated as a rectangular strip @xmath1\\times\\mathbb{r}$ ] , along the center of which lies the bm .    ( 1,1 ) ( 0,1 ) ( 1,0 ) ( -0.05,1.10)@xmath2 ( 1.05,-0.05)@xmath3    @xmath4 + @xmath5 + 0 + @xmath6 + @xmath7 +    , and the flat equilibrium state by a red dotted line . to simplify the analysis , even symmetry is imposed across @xmath8 and @xmath9 so that the solution is defined for all @xmath10 , although only values of @xmath11 $ ] have physical relevance . ]",
    "this work is primarily concerned with the effects of parametric forcing on bm oscillations and so we simplify the model by isolating the membrane from any boundary effects due to the cochlear walls . for the purposes of the mathematical analysis , we take the depth of the cochlear duct to be infinite ( @xmath12 ) which is consistent with the _ short - wave approximation _  @xcite and has been used previously by various authors  @xcite .",
    "this assumption neglects effects such as coherent backscattering localized near the travelling wave peak  @xcite , but we have found that this does not significantly impact on the results of our stability analysis .",
    "furthermore , we impose neumann boundary conditions in the @xmath3-direction which is an assumption that has also been justified for other cochlea models  @xcite .",
    "the fluid in which the bm is immersed is governed by the incompressible navier - stokes equations @xmath13 where @xmath14 is velocity , @xmath15 is pressure , @xmath16 is density , and @xmath17 is viscosity . the elastic force exerted on the fluid by the membrane is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the two - dimensional dirac delta function , @xmath20 is the position of the membrane parameterized by the lagrangian coordinate @xmath21 $ ] , and @xmath22 is the horizontal equilibrium or rest state .",
    "this force can be thought of as arising from a membrane that is connected to its resting position via a series of hookean springs with `` spring constant '' or stiffness @xmath23 .",
    "the elastic stiffness parameter is a function of time and space given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the time - averaged elastic stiffness constant ( units of @xmath26 )  and @xmath27 captures the spatial variation in stiffness along the bm . the value of @xmath28 has been determined for a human cochlea experimentally by von  bksy  @xcite and others , based on the observation that the bm stiffness at the apex is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than that at the base , and that it decays roughly exponentially .",
    "the time - dependent factor in the stiffness encapsulates the parametric forcing with amplitude @xmath29 and frequency @xmath30 arising from outer hair cells that contract / expand in response to bm oscillations  @xcite .",
    "note in particular that the forcing frequency @xmath30 is taken to be the same as that of the input sound signal and is also constant in space , which assumes that the outer hair cells contract in synchrony along the entire cp .",
    "this is in contrast with most other models of the cochlea that consider hair cell contractions in response to local stimuli , which would correspond to a stiffness parameter having spatiotemporal dependence that is not separable .",
    "there is nothing in our analytical approach that prevents us from considering this situation , but we nonetheless restrict our attention to the separable form in for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we close the system of equations with an expression for the membrane motion @xmath31 which is equivalent to the fluid no - slip condition along the immersed boundary .    to simplify the analysis in the remainder of this paper , we non - dimensionalize the problem by introducing the following scalings @xmath32 where the tildes denote a non - dimensional quantity .",
    "the characteristic velocity and pressure scales , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , will be specified shortly .",
    "the horizontal extent of the rescaled domain @xmath35\\times\\mathbb{r}$ ] is chosen for reasons of mathematical convenience , in order to eliminate a factor of @xmath36 that would otherwise appear in the solutions derived in section  [ sec : analysis ] .    substituting the above variables into the governing equations   yields @xmath37 the velocity and pressure scales are chosen as @xmath38 from this point onwards",
    ", the tildes will be dropped .",
    "we next proceed to linearize the governing equations for the purpose of making the analysis tractable .",
    "the typical vertical displacement of the bm is approximately @xmath39  cm which is six orders of magnitude smaller than its length of 3.5  cm  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the flow reynolds number is very low , on the order of @xmath39 or less , and so nonlinear effects can be ignored . assuming that there is negligible coupling in the membrane along the longitudinal ( @xmath3 ) direction , we only consider membrane displacements in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "another major simplification is achieved by eliminating the delta functions and reformulating the problem in terms of jump conditions across the bm .",
    "to do so , we integrate the governing equations across the membrane at its linearized rest state @xmath40  @xcite , yielding the alternate system of equations @xmath41 away from the bm and @xmath42 across the membrane where @xmath43 represents the vertical membrane displacement , @xmath44 is the jump in pressure across the membrane , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the horizontal and vertical components of the vector velocity @xmath47 .",
    " were studied analytically in  @xcite without the time - varying stiffness parameter ( that is , with @xmath48 ) .",
    "owing to the presence of a time - varying parameter in the system , we invoke floquet theory  @xcite to analyze the stability of perturbations of the membrane from its resting state .",
    "floquet theory assumes a solution of the form @xmath49 where the function @xmath50 is periodic in time with period @xmath51 .",
    "the floquet exponent @xmath52 determines the stability of the solution as @xmath53 . for the purposes of our analysis",
    ", we extend the @xmath3-domain to @xmath54 $ ] and impose even symmetry across @xmath8 .",
    "we then take the unknown variables to be of the form @xmath55 where we have assumed that @xmath50 can be expanded using a fourier series in both space and time .",
    "our solution approach is similar to that used by cortez et al .",
    "@xcite ( modulo the corrections in  @xcite ) who analyzed the stability of a 2d circular membrane in response to a perturbation in the form of a single fourier mode .",
    "in contrast , here we must represent each solution mode as an infinite fourier series because of the mode - coupling through the spatial non - uniformity in the stiffness parameter which will be shown later in this section .",
    "we begin by finding solutions for the @xmath2-dependent fourier coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "take the divergence of the momentum equations and apply the incompressibility condition to arrive at a poisson problem for pressure @xmath59 here we have simplified notation by setting @xmath60}$ ] and denoting @xmath2-derivatives using primes .",
    "the @xmath61 are all linearly independent and so we have a decoupled system of ordinary differential equations for the @xmath62 @xmath63 which after imposing boundedness in @xmath2 yields the pressure solution @xmath64 for each @xmath65 , with constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 yet to be determined .",
    "note that taking @xmath68 is valid in the above expression since this implies simply a constant pressure in each sub - domain .",
    "we can now solve for the fourier coefficients of the vertical velocity component @xmath69 by substituting the series into the momentum equation to obtain @xmath70 this is equivalent to the infinite linear system of ordinary differential equations @xmath71 where @xmath72 assuming that @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the solution is @xmath75 the continuity equation reduces to @xmath76 from which @xmath77 are found to be @xmath78 we then impose the continuity conditions on velocity across the membrane @xmath79 which can be solved in terms of the @xmath80 as @xmath81 we note that the special cases @xmath82 and @xmath68 both yield the trivial solution , @xmath83 .    using the jump condition",
    ", we can now formulate an infinite system of linear equations that connects all of the membrane coefficients , @xmath80 . substituting the solution for pressure into , we obtain @xmath84 provided that @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in the special cases when @xmath82 or @xmath68 , these equations reduce to @xmath87    in order to proceed any further , we first need to expand the exponential ( @xmath88 ) and sinusoidal ( @xmath89 ) terms in their respective fourier series . for the time - dependent factor , we can write @xmath90 , but the fourier series for the exponential function does not converge uniformly because @xmath88 is not a periodic function on @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "it is for this reason that we have extended the spatial domain to @xmath54 $ ] , and then we simply need to remember that is only the portion with @xmath92 that is of physical interest .",
    "we instead use the even periodic extension @xmath93 of the elastic stiffness function on this extended interval .",
    "then , for @xmath94 and @xmath95 we have @xmath96 while for @xmath82 or @xmath68 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath93 on @xmath54 $ ] . the complex exponential terms involving @xmath3 and @xmath99 in eqs .   and   introduce a shift in the indices of @xmath61 in both @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which has the effect of coupling the corresponding modes .",
    "we can then rearrange the sum in order to gather together all terms involving the common expression @xmath61 , and hence obtain @xmath102 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath103 for either of the special cases @xmath82 or @xmath68 .",
    "these last two equations comprise an infinite linear system for the @xmath104 in which the spatially - dependent stiffness introduces a simultaneous coupling between all spatial modes that is not present in the spatially - uniform ( @xmath105 ) case from  @xcite .",
    "because we are interested in investigating the stability of the parametrically forced problem , and in particular finding the stability boundary in parameter space , we only have to look for periodic solutions of eqs .   in the situation when @xmath106 .",
    "furthermore , there are only two distinct values of @xmath107 that are of actual interest for determining the stability boundary : the first corresponds to @xmath108 and will be referred to as the _ harmonic _ case ; and the second , @xmath109 , is called the _ subharmonic _ case . to ensure that the solution @xmath43 is real - valued",
    ", we impose _ reality conditions _ for the fourier coefficients that apply to both time and space indices .",
    "in general , the reality condition for a two - dimensional fourier series is @xmath110 where the overbar denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "however , we have to consider the harmonic and subharmonic cases separately when applying the condition in the temporal modes .",
    "furthermore , we want to ensure an even spatial symmetry in our solutions which leads to a decoupling in the reality condition .",
    "consequently , the reality conditions that we impose are @xmath111 as a result , the reality conditions introduce a certain symmetry between the fourier coefficients such that we only need to consider non - negative values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "unstable solutions correspond to parameter values that lie above and inside each tongue , while parameter values below the tongues yield stable solutions .",
    "although we can expect parametric resonance to occur for any choice of parameters located inside one of the unstable tongues , the parameters are further constrained by the following two physical considerations : first , that only modes corresponding to integer values of @xmath101 are physically realizable ; and second , that the forcing amplitude must satisfy @xmath209 so that the bm stiffness @xmath23 remains non - negative . to get a clearer idea of the unstable modes that correspond to physical bm oscillations , we fix @xmath101 at integer values ranging from 1 through 6 and display in figure  [ fig : eigs - lam0-k ] the stability plots as a function of frequency @xmath30 on the horizontal axis . in each case",
    "the right - most tongue is labelled `` h '' or `` s '' and the subsequent tongues moving to the left alternate between harmonic and subharmonic modes .",

    "we use a standard approach similar to the algorithm described in  @xcite , in which the fluid variables are discretized on an equally - spaced rectangular grid and the membrane on a moving set of lagrangian points . a split - step projection method is used to solve the incompressible navier - stokes equations and a regularized delta function is used to approximate the integral terms that encapsulate the fluid - structure interaction .",

    "in contrast with the @xmath105 results from the previous section where stability contours are disjoint and the behaviour of a given mode is easy to identify , we observe that contours overlap due to the coupling between spatial modes .",
    "a similar `` mode - mixing '' effect has been observed in other physical systems such as the double pendulum  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that the number of stability contours depends strongly on the number of spatial modes @xmath159 included in the truncated series expansion ; in particular , increasing @xmath159 gives rise to more stability contours that tend to pack more closely together .",
    "as @xmath159 gets large , the contour `` tongue - tips '' sweep out a smooth curve that divides parameter space into stable and unstable solutions as seen in the bottom row of plots in figure  [ fig : eigs ] for @xmath219 .",
    "we note that convergence in the time modes is much faster than in the spatial modes , thereby requiring that @xmath159 be taken significantly larger than @xmath220 in order to achieve accurate results .",
    "we note in particular that when either @xmath221 or @xmath222 , all coefficients satisfy @xmath223 and so the neglected modes have negligible effect on our computed results .",

    ". in each case we also choose three different values of the forcing amplitude , @xmath232 , 0.08 and 0.1 .",
    "even though the initial condition contains a pure wavenumber @xmath213 mode , all @xmath101-modes are eventually excited because of the mode - coupling that arises through the spatially - dependent stiffness .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : eigs ] , we expect the @xmath232 cases to be stable ( since the tips of all tongues lie above this value of @xmath29 ) while taking @xmath29 any larger should destabilize the solution .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations with @xmath233 do show that bm oscillations decay in time and that the parametric forcing is insufficient to initiate an instability .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath29 is increased to 0.08 , the solutions become unstable , sustained oscillations appear , and for the largest value of @xmath214 the peak amplitude grows even larger .",
    "it is important to note that in all of the resonant cases simulated , the oscillation frequency is half of the internal forcing frequency , which is a common signature of parametric resonance .",
    "slight differences arise from the fact that our numerical simulations are on a doubly - periodic domain of finite length , whereas the analysis assumes a fluid domain of infinite extent in @xmath2 .",
