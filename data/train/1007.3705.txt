    "the fabrication of single layers of carbon with atomic thickness has provided us with a laboratory to explore new physics@xcite , as the electrons in this so - called graphene behave at low energies as massless dirac fermions , displaying conical valence and conduction bands@xcite .",
    "apart from its quite interesting properties from the applied point of view , the new material offers the possibility of studying an electron system that is a variant of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in the strong coupling regime , with unusual features as shown for instance in refs . .",
    "a remarkable feature of this field theory of electrons in graphene is its scale - invariant character@xcite .",
    "this means for practical purposes that , while many - body corrections give rise in general to dependences on the high - energy cutoff , these are susceptible of being reabsorbed into the definition of physical quantities .",
    "consequently , some of the parameters of the theory may have a nontrivial scaling in the low - energy limit .",
    "the quasiparticle weight is for instance renormalized , and it would be driven to zero if its flow were not arrested by the divergence of the fermi velocity in the infrared@xcite .",
    "this marginal behavior leaves anyhow an imprint in the quasiparticle decay rate@xcite , with an unconventional dependence on energy which has been observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "an important phenomenon that may take place in a system of massless dirac fermions is the opening of a gap in the regime of strong interaction . in this respect ,",
    "the case of qed in 2 + 1 dimensions can serve as a good example , in which the original @xmath2 chiral symmetry of the theory with @xmath0 massless two - component dirac fermions is spontaneously broken below a critical number of flavors @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) has been also studied in graphene by a number of analytical@xcite as well as numerical methods@xcite .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn from different approaches is that a gap can open up in the dirac spectrum , though the effect may only appear below some critical value of @xmath0 and above some critical interaction strength . in this picture",
    ", there remain however important questions to be addressed , related to the effect of the above mentioned scaling of the parameters in the model .",
    "we point out in particular that the strength of any four - fermion interaction in the dirac field theory has to be measured relative to the weight of the kinetic energy , that scales with the fermi velocity .",
    "then , it is crucial to clarify whether the divergence of this parameter in the infrared may prevent the csb even for a small number of dirac fermions .    in this paper",
    "we apply renormalization group methods to study the csb in the field theory of dirac fermions in graphene .",
    "we consider that this electron system is governed at low energies by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a collection of @xmath6 four - component dirac spinors , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the matrices @xmath9 satisfy @xmath10 and can be conveniently represented in terms of pauli matrices as @xmath11 , where the first factor acts on the two sublattice components of the graphene lattice . our aim is to elucidate whether a term of the type @xmath12 is generated spontaneously in the hamiltonian of the electron system . a convenient way to address",
    "this question is to look at the susceptibility built from that operator , that is , at the correlator @xmath13 @xmath14 is actually a response function measuring the reaction of the system under a slight difference of scalar potential in the two sublattices of the graphene lattice .",
    "a divergence of @xmath15 at some particular value of the coupling constant can be interpreted as the signal that @xmath16 is getting a nonvanishing expectation value , which is in turn the signature of the opening of a gap in the dirac spectrum .",
    "we will take advantage of the power of the renormalization group to characterize the possible singular behavior of @xmath17 as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "for this purpose , we concentrate on the corrections to the vertex built from @xmath19 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ one ] and [ three ] . in the process of renormalization",
    ", @xmath20 may get in general an anomalous dimension @xmath21 , modifying the naive scaling of the susceptibility , @xmath22 in what follows , we apply different approaches for the determination of @xmath21 , in order to establish the existence of a singular behavior in the long - distance scaling of the susceptibility @xmath17 .",
    "we can go beyond the usual perturbative approach in the coupling @xmath18 by taking formally a large number @xmath0 of fermion flavors , to perform then the sum of all the diagrams that arise to leading order in a @xmath23 expansion .",
    "if we think of all possible contributions to the expectation value @xmath24 , it is clear that the leading corrections in @xmath23 are given by the iteration of the exchange of electron - hole bubbles in the interaction between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 fields .",
    "this amounts to adopt the rpa for the dressed coulomb interaction represented in fig .",
    "[ one ] . introducing the polarization @xmath27",
    ", we get for the corresponding vertex function @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for the free dirac propagator .",
    "we recall that , in the case of @xmath0 two - component dirac fermions , @xmath30 .",
    "an interesting feature of the sum in ( [ vert ] ) is that , while a high - energy cutoff @xmath31 has to be imposed to make the integrals finite , all the terms show the same degree of logarithmic dependence on the cutoff . by passing to imaginary frequency @xmath32",
    ", we can compute the divergent contribution to the vertex as @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the singularity at @xmath35 is only apparent , as the function in ( [ div ] ) can be continued analytically to @xmath36 by taking @xmath37 . in this way",
    ", we end up with an expression of the vertex that becomes sensible for arbitrarily large values of the effective coupling .",
    "the divergence of the vertex @xmath38 at large @xmath31 has to be removed by absorbing the dependence on the cutoff into the scale @xmath39 of the composite field @xmath19@xcite .",
    "however , this is not the only field redefinition to be accomplished , as the finiteness of the full dirac propagator demands the introduction of a cutoff - dependent scale for the dirac field , such that @xmath40",
    ". the electron self - energy can be actually found in ref . to dominant order in the @xmath23 approximation , providing the result @xmath41    the cutoff - independence of the vertex @xmath38 must be guaranteed after multiplication by @xmath42 and the scale @xmath39 of the composite field .",
    "we define the renormalized vertex as @xmath43 . by imposing the finiteness of @xmath44",
    ", we obtain to leading order in the @xmath23 expansion @xmath45    the knowledge of @xmath39 can now be used to determine the anomalous scaling of the susceptibility @xmath46 .",
    "this correlator involves two composite operators @xmath19 , and it can be made cutoff - independent by multiplying each of them by their renormalization factor .",
    "the finite susceptibility is then @xmath47 .",
    "a renormalization group equation can be obtained for @xmath17 , relying on the independence of the susceptibility on @xmath31 in the renormalized theory@xcite .",
    "we obtain from the invariance of @xmath48 @xmath49 with the anomalous dimension @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in the bare theory with a cutoff @xmath31",
    ", it follows from dimensional analysis that the susceptibility @xmath17 can be written in terms of a dimensionless function @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "then , neglecting in a first approximation the scaling of the effective coupling , the solution of ( [ rge ] ) implies that @xmath54 , with the behavior anticipated in eq .",
    "( [ scal ] ) .",
    "the anomalous dimension obtained from ( [ largen ] ) is @xmath55 and it turns out to be a monotonous , increasing function of @xmath56 .",
    "this means that , provided that it gets sufficiently large , there may exist a critical value @xmath57 at which @xmath58 becomes singular in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "the divergence of this susceptibility implies a long - wavelength instability , which can be interpreted as the development of a nonvanishing expectation value of @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath57 depends in general on the number of flavors @xmath0 .",
    "we can draw then a boundary marking the onset of csb in @xmath61 space .",
    "this line of transition , characterized by the condition @xmath62 , is shown in fig . [ two ] .",
    "the expression ( [ gamma2 ] ) leads to the existence of a critical number of flavors @xmath3 , above which csb can not take place .",
    "if we let @xmath63 in that equation , we approach the maximum value of @xmath21 , from which we find @xmath1 .",
    "it is very suggestive that this critical @xmath0 is precisely half the value obtained in qed in 2 + 1 dimensions@xcite .",
    "technically , the methods used to derive @xmath3 in each model can not be easily compared , as qed is not a scale - invariant field theory in that number of dimensions . on intuitive grounds ,",
    "however , one can understand the relation between the two values of @xmath3 , as the photon propagating in qed has two different degrees of freedom .",
    "this may explain that twice the number of flavors are needed there to equally screen the interaction , in comparison to our model with just the scalar coulomb potential .",
    "we resort now to an approach that can better capture the behavior of the system to the right of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ two ] . for this purpose",
    ", it is pertinent to adopt a self - consistent approximation in the calculation of the vertex @xmath38 , equivalent to the sum of ladder diagrams , by which the most divergent logarithmic dependences are taken into account at each perturbative level@xcite .",
    "the approach is encoded in the self - consistent equation shown in fig .",
    "[ three ] .",
    "the perturbative solution leads to a power series in the effective coupling @xmath64 , where the term of order @xmath65 diverges in general with the high - energy cutoff as @xmath66 .",
    "the important point is that the set of diagrams considered in this way allows to implement a consistent renormalization of the theory , where @xmath39 is free of nonlocal divergences , making possible a precise computation of the anomalous dimension @xmath21 .    a solution of the equation in fig .",
    "[ three ] has been given in ref .",
    "regularizing the momentum integrals with an infrared and a high - energy cutoff . here , in order to facilitate the calculation of the divergences of the vertex @xmath38 , we define instead the field theory by analytic continuation to spatial dimension @xmath67 . after integration in the frequency variable , the self - consistent equation for",
    "the vertex takes the form @xmath68 where the dimensionful coupling @xmath69 is given in terms of an auxiliary momentum scale @xmath70 by @xmath71 ( see below ) .",
    "thus , powers of @xmath72 are traded by poles at @xmath73 in the different perturbative contributions , which are easier to compute . in principle , eq .",
    "( [ self ] ) could also afford a nonperturbative resolution , but the computation of the anomalous dimension would be complicated then as this is obtained from the residue of the @xmath74 pole .",

    "( [ self ] ) , which couples the equations for the coefficients of the different powers of @xmath75 .",
    "this is otherwise a natural consequence of the regularization of the diagrams , since the interdependence of the different poles is a key property of a renormalizable theory , as we illustrate below .",
    "we resort then to an iterative resolution of eq .",
    "( [ self ] ) , by which we can obtain a recursion between consecutive orders in the power series for the vertex @xmath76 it can be easily seen that the momentum dependence of the different orders takes in general the form @xmath77 inserting the @xmath78-th term of the series in the right - hand - side of eq .",

    ", the renormalization factor @xmath39 must have the general structure @xmath86 the position of the different poles is determined by requiring the finiteness of @xmath87 in the limit @xmath88 . from the expression ( [ ladder ] ) , we can obtain the power series @xmath89 and so on , with the next @xmath90 starting each time with one more power of the coupling .    of all the poles ,",
    "only the first can contribute to the anomalous dimension @xmath21 .",
    "this is because the theory at @xmath91 has a finite limit @xmath92 , and the cutoff only appears from the need to define the units of dimensionful quantities like @xmath70 .",
    "the implicit dependence @xmath93 leads to @xmath94 and , following eq .",
    "( [ anom ] ) , @xmath95 in principle , the right - hand - side of ( [ dreg ] ) can contain contributions from higher order poles in ( [ poles ] ) , but these will vanish provided that @xmath96 , identically for every @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "these are key constraints in order to have a renormalizable theory , since they guarantee the finiteness of @xmath21 in the limit @xmath88 .",
    "quite remarkably , we have checked that those relations are indeed satisfied in our case , up to the order @xmath97 for which we have computed the exact expression of @xmath98 .",
    "the other important check we have made along the way is that @xmath39 does not contain nonlocal divergences proportional to @xmath99 , which appear at intermediate stages of the calculation . in the case of the simple pole",
    ", we have the result to order @xmath97 @xmath100 the general term of this series does not have a simple expression , but one can still obtain numerically higher orders of the perturbative expansion to determine the behavior of the function @xmath101 .",
    "thus , we have computed the coefficients @xmath102 of the power series in @xmath103 up to order @xmath104 , what is enough to establish their exponential growth with @xmath78 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig . [",
    "four ] , showing that @xmath105 a best fit of the asymptotic behavior at large @xmath78 gives the value @xmath106 .",
    "the important point is the evidence that the anomalous dimension @xmath21 obtained from ( [ dreg ] ) must have a singularity at a finite value of the effective coupling @xmath107 .",
    "as one approaches this value from below , the anomalous dimension gets arbitrarily large , meaning that the opening of a gap is the effect that has to prevail in the system near @xmath108 , in spite of the upward renormalization of the fermi velocity at low energies@xcite .",
    "this applies in particular to the theory with small number of flavors , implying that , to the right of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ two ] , csb should take place above a critical coupling @xmath109 .",
    "in this paper we have applied renormalization group methods to analyze the development of a gapped phase in graphene , taking advantage of the scaling properties of the theory of interacting dirac fermions in the 2d system . in this regard , an important effect that may question",
    "the breakdown of the chiral symmetry is the divergence of the renormalized fermi velocity at low energies . in principle",
    ", the downward scaling of the effective coupling @xmath18 can prevent to remain above the line of the transition in fig . [",
    "two ] , even in cases where the nominal value of the coupling places the model inside the region with @xmath110 .",
    "similar objection for the csb can be applied to additional local four - fermion interactions , as their relative strength is always to be measured with respect to the scale of the kinetic energy .",
    "one may argue however that , in a statistical formulation of the problem , there has to be a critical temperature for the transition to the gapped phase .",
    "the temperature is also a relevant scale arresting the renormalization of the fermi velocity at low energies .",
    "then , it is feasible that the renormalized coupling @xmath18 may still keep a sufficiently large value to force the transition at the critical energy scale .",
    "we note that our results in the large-@xmath0 approach establish that , for the physical value @xmath111 , graphene would remain in the gapless phase even for the largest values of the effective coupling attained in vacuum ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that no evidence of transition to an insulating state has been found in free - standing graphene .",
    "the other important conclusion is that csb must exist anyhow at sufficiently small values of @xmath0 , given the evidence we have obtained of a critical coupling at which the anomalous dimension of the order parameter diverges .",
    "this result could explain the observation of a transition in monte carlo simulations of the long - range coulomb interaction in the 2d system@xcite .",
    "a natural prediction from our analysis is that the gapped phase should emerge at some point in the way from @xmath111 to @xmath113 .",
    "the spin projection can be frozen for instance by applying a magnetic field , and it is actually very appealing to think that the metal - insulator transition observed in that case in graphene may rest on this effect of csb .",
    "it remains to be seen whether quenching also the dirac - valley degree of freedom could lead to an insulating state for accessible values of @xmath18 , in accordance with the results of this study .",
    "we note that the study in ref . has also found evidence of a critical point in the ladder approximation , which in that case corresponds in general to the transition from real to complex behavior of the @xmath114 susceptibility ."
