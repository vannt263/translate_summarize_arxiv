    "@xmath77 is a rather difficult problem @xcite .",
    "the free - electron landau approximation , which is often used for estimations , provides @xmath79 that equals @xmath80 of the pauli spin susceptibility .",

    "it is presumably related to a fine structure of dos at @xmath46 , but one should expect that fese system is driven far from the ground state at room temperatures . at this stage we should admit that increase of the unit cell volume for the tetragonal @xmath10 phase ( @xmath85 with temperature rising up to 300 k , see ref . ) can provide about 10% growth of paramagnetic susceptibility , according to the @xmath65 dependence in fig .",

    "the grounds of the negative sign of dln@xmath0/d@xmath35 derivative in fese at 300 k are unclear and probably linked to a nature of the observed anomalous growth of @xmath84 . at present",
    "one can state that at higher temperatures this anomalous growth of @xmath84 in fese is apparently reduced by applied pressure .",
    "the present _ ab initio _ calculations have demonstrated that for fese compound the nonmonotonic behavior of superconducting transition temperature with pressure qualitatively correlates with the density of electronic states at the fermi level .",
    "this indicates a possible realization of the bcs - like pairing mechanism in this system .",
