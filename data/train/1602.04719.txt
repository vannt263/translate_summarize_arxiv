    "freely decaying turbulence becomes similar to isotropic homogeneous turbulence after going through certain stages of development .",

    "when it reached @xmath5 , the dns had resolution @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the kolmogorov microscale ) .",

    "distributed chaos in the statistically stationary isotropic and homogeneous turbulence has two main attractors associated with the two main space symmetries : translational ( homogeneity ) and rotational ( isotropy ) @xcite . let us denote these attractors as h - attractor and i - attractor correspondingly .",
    "due to the noether s theorem these attractors are associated also with two main conservation laws : conservation of linear and of angular momentum @xcite , and through these conservation laws with the birkhoff - saffman ( @xmath11 ) and loitsyanskii ( @xmath12 ) invariants @xcite,@xcite,@xcite @xmath13    let us recall that the invariants which ( due to the noether s theorem ) are consequences of the space symmetries are compatible with viscosity dissipation @xcite,@xcite . therefore , unlike the invariant ( energy ) associated with time translational symmetry , these invariants do not demand large reynolds numbers in order to be applicable , and they can be well applied to the near dissipation range of scales @xcite,@xcite and to the decaying turbulence with relatively small reynolds numbers .",
    "the h- and i - attractors have different sets of initial conditions which eventually approach each attractor ( so called basin of attraction ) .",
    "it is known that basin of attraction of the i - attractor is small and thin in comparison with the h - attractor . because of this the birkhoff - saffman integral @xmath11 dominates the distributed chaos dynamics in the statistically _ stationary _ isotropic and homogeneous turbulence @xcite . but just because of this the i - attractor approaches its developed state earlier than the h - attractor in the _ decaying _ turbulence .",
    "the i - attractor needs in less time to involve its small and thin basin of attraction than the h - attractor with its large basin of attraction .",
    "therefore , we can expect that in the decaying turbulence there exists an _",
    "intermediate _ range of times where the i - attractor dominates chaotic dynamics just because the h - attractor is still not developed enough .",
    "with advance of the h - attractor development the competition depends on stability of the i - attractor both to the instant perturbations and to noise .",
    "if the energy spectrum of the initial data is chosen ( in dns , for instance ) proportional to @xmath14 for small @xmath15 , then the basin of attraction of the i - attractor has certain preference @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , that results in an additional delay of the h - attractor development in comparison with i - attractor .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the birkhoff - saffman ( h - attractor ) and loitsyanskii ( i - attractor ) regimes in the decaying turbulence using data on decay of the global variables such as total energy .",
    "the energy spectra can be more informative for this purpose , because they provide a broad information about local dynamics in the wavenumbers space at each time point .",
    "the velocity power spectra for the distributed chaos have a stretched exponential form @xcite @xmath16 in the asymptotic theory suggested in the ref .",
    "@xcite scale invariance of the group velocity of the waves driving the chaos @xmath17 at @xmath18 , provides @xmath19 by the dimensional considerations , and then @xmath20    for the h - attractor ( birkhoff - saffman invariant ) @xmath21 whereas for the i - attractor ( loitsyanskii invariant ) @xmath22 .",

    "one can see that competitiveness of the h - attractor against i - attractor increases with time , as expected for the developing attractors .",
