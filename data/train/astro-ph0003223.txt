    "in the evolution of stars the position of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) marks the starting point of helium burning in the core .",
    "it is one of the strongest characteristics of the life of stars seen in theoretical models , together with the main sequence turn  off point , the red giant and the asymptotic giant clump .",
    "it has been used successfully for several decades ( sandage @xcite ) to estimate the distance of resolved galaxies ( e.g. , lee , freedman & madore @xcite ) .",
    "the trgb magnitude depends only very weakly on age and metallicity , and yields comparable precision as classical distance indicators such as cepheids and rr  lyra variables .",
    "cioni et al .  ( @xcite ) prepared the denis catalogue towards the magellanic clouds ( dcmc ) , as part of the deep near infrared southern sky survey performed with the 1 m eso telescope ( epchtein et al .",
    "the catalogue contains about @xmath10 and @xmath11 sources toward the lmc and the smc , respectively ; @xmath12% of them are real members of the clouds and consist mainly of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , and @xmath13% are galactic foreground objects .",
    "this is a very large and homogeneous statistical sample that allows a highly accurate determination of the trgb magnitude at the corresponding wavelengths . among other things ,",
    "this yields an important new determination of the distance modulus of the lmc .",
    "this distance modulus is one of the main stepping stones in the cosmological distance ladder , yet has remained somewhat uncertain and controversial ( e.g. , mould et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "section  2 describes how the data were selected from the dcmc catalogue to avoid crowding effects , and how we have calculated bolometric corrections .",
    "section  3 discusses the luminosity function ( lf ) and the subtraction of the foreground component .",
    "section  4 discusses the trgb determination and gives comparisons with previous measurements .",
    "section  5 discusses the implications for the distances to the magellanic clouds .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  6 .",
    "the appendix provides a detailed description of the new method that we have used to quantify the trgb magnitude , as well a discussion of the formal and systematic errors in the analysis .",
    "the dcmc covers a surface area of @xmath14 square degrees centered on @xmath15,@xmath16 toward the lmc and @xmath17 square degrees centered on @xmath18,@xmath19 toward the smc ( j2000 coordinates ) .",
    "we extracted all the sources detected simultaneously in the three denis photometric wave bands : @xmath0 ( @xmath1 m ) , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 m ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 m ) .",
    "we excluded sources that were detected in all three wave bands but at different times ( this can happen because denis strips overlap ) .",
    "the selection of sources that are present in all three wave bands strongly reduces possible crowding effects that affect mostly the @xmath0 band .",
    "we removed sources affected , even slightly , by image defects ( null image flag ) and sources with bright neighbours or bad pixels , sources that were originally blended , or sources with at least one saturated pixel ( null extraction flag ) .",
    "this increases the level of confidence on the resulting sample .",
    "the main final sample for the present analysis contains @xmath20 sources toward the smc and @xmath21 sources toward the lmc .",
    "this constitutes about @xmath22% of all the sources listed for each cloud in the dcmc .    to estimate the contribution of the foreground component we also considered the data in offset fields outside the spatial limits of the dcmc , covering the same range in right ascension and from a maximum of @xmath23 to a minimum of @xmath24 ( the full declination range of a denis strip ) .",
    "these data were reduced together and the same selection criteria , on the basis of the detection wave bands and the flags , were applied as to the data constituting the dcmc .",
    "the total sample ( dcmc plus extension in declination ) contains @xmath25 and @xmath26 sources in the ra ranges for the smc and the lmc , respectively .    the distribution of the formal photometric errors in each wave band is shown in fig .",
    "[ errs ] . at the brighter magnitudes ( those of interest for the trgb determination ) ,",
    "the random errors in the sample are not dominated by the formal photometric errors , but by random errors in the photometric zero  points for the individual strips .",
    "the dispersions ( @xmath27 ) of these zero - point variations are @xmath28 mag in the @xmath0 band , @xmath29 mag in the @xmath2 band and @xmath30 mag in the @xmath4 band .",
    "note that the formal error with which the trgb magnitude can be determined is not limited to the size of these zero - point variations , but instead can be quite small ( the formal error is proportional to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of stars in the sample ) .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 magnitudes in the present paper are all in the photometric system associated with the denis passbands .",
    "these magnitudes are not identical to the classical cousins @xmath0 and ctio @xmath2 and @xmath33 magnitudes , although they are close ( differences are @xmath34 magnitudes )",
    ". the final transformation equations for the passbands will not be available until the survey is completed , but a preliminary analysis is presented by fouqu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "note that our determinations of the distance moduli for the lmc and the smc ( section  5 ) are based on bolometric magnitudes derived from the data , which are fully corrected for the specifics of the denis passbands .",
    "we have calculated the apparent bolometric magnitude ( @xmath6 ) for all the sources selected according to the criteria described in section  2.1 , and with @xmath35 .",
    "we have chosen to use only the @xmath2 and @xmath4 bands to derive @xmath6 ( see below ) .",
    "sources with @xmath36 do not influence the position of the trgb ( see fig .",
    "[ cm ] below ) , and have too low a percentage of flux in the near - infrared ( nir ) to give a reliable measure of @xmath6 with these criteria .",
    "we used two different bolometric corrections , depending on the @xmath37 colour . for sources with @xmath38",
    ", we simply use a blackbody fit on the @xmath37 colour ; such sources are mostly rgb or early agb ( e  agb ) stars in our sample .",
    "sources with larger values of @xmath37 are mostly thermally pulsing agb ( tp  agb ) stars , some of which are losing mass and are surrounded by a circumstellar envelope . for them we used the results of individual modelling of galactic carbon ( c ) stars by groenewegen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , combined with a series of models of increasing dust opacity where the central star has a spectral type @xmath39 and the dust grains are composed of silicates ( groenewegen , private communication ) .    in both cases ,",
    "blackbody fit and spectral models , our method to infer @xmath6 is different from what is usually performed in the literature .",
    "we do not make any attempt to transform a magnitude , i.e.  an integrated flux over the passband , into a flux density at a reference wavelength , in order to suppress one step which already makes an assumption on the spectral distribution of the source .",
    "we only use the integrated flux measured over the @xmath2 and @xmath4 denis passbands .",
    "theoretical spectral distributions , i.e.  blackbodies with temperatures ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 k and the models from groenewegen and collaborators , were multiplied with the denis passbands ( which includes a mean atmosphere at la silla observatory ) to derive the percentage of the total flux which is measured in each denis passband as a function of the denis colours .",
    "then , for each selected dcmc source , @xmath6 is calculated by interpolating in the theoretical grids the percentage of flux measured in the @xmath2 and @xmath4 bands from the observed @xmath37 colour .",
    "we have used here the same zero point as in montegriffo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "more details are provided in loup et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we have compared our results with the bolometric corrections @xmath42 inferred by montegriffo et al . as can be seen in their fig .  3 , their bolometric correction is valid only for sources with @xmath43 , with a typical spread around the fit of @xmath44 magnitude",
    ". for sources with @xmath45 our blackbody fit agrees with their bolometric corrections to within the errors . on the other hand , for some sources with @xmath46 ,",
    "they underestimate @xmath6 by @xmath47 to @xmath48 magnitudes compared to our calculations .",
    "this is not surprising and can be inferred already from their fig .",
    "3 ; it does not indicate a shortcoming in our approach .",
    "we also compared our results with what one obtains by making blackbody fits using both the ( @xmath49 ) and ( @xmath50 ) colours . for sources with @xmath51 it does not produce any systematic effect ; there is merely a spread of typically @xmath44 magnitude between both calculations , consistent with the formal errors .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath0 band would produce a systematic effect for bluer sources than those selected here , but those are not relevant for the trgb determination .",
    "we therefore decided to use only the @xmath2 and @xmath4 band data in our calculations of @xmath52 , to minimize the effects of the interstellar reddening which are much more pronounced in the @xmath0 band than in @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "there are both random and systematic errors in our estimates of @xmath52 .",
    "the random errors come from two sources , namely from the observational uncertainties in the observed @xmath2 and @xmath4 band magnitudes , and from the corresponding uncertainties in the @xmath37 color .",
    "we have calculated the resulting random errors in the @xmath53 estimates through propagation of these errors .",
    "there are also two sources of systematic error in the @xmath52 estimates .",
    "the first one derives from uncertainties in the dust extinction correction .",
    "our treatment of dust extinction is discussed in section  2.3 ; appendix a.3.4 discusses how the uncertainties in this correction introduce a small systematic error on the trgb magnitude determination .",
    "the second source of systematic error comes from the difference between the real spectral energy distribution of the star and the one we assume to estimate @xmath6 . for blackbody fits",
    ", we did not make any attempt to estimate this error because we lack information for that purpose ( we would need spectra and/or ubvrijhkl photometry on a sample of stars ) . for the agb star models from groenewegen and collaborators , we can estimate part of this error .",
    "the @xmath37 colour does not provide enough information to fully constrain the set of model parameters , i.e. @xmath37 does not give a unique solution , especially when the chemical type of the star is unknown . with the models available in this work ,",
    "we have estimated this systematic model error to be 5% on the interpolated percentage of flux .",
    "this is of course a lower limit as there can be some objects whose spectral energy distribution differs from all the ones produced in the models . on the other hand , for most stars near the trgb",
    "the blackbody fit is the relevant model , and for these the systematic errors could be smaller . in the end",
    "we have included in our final error budget a systematic error of @xmath54 mag in our @xmath52 estimates due to uncertainties in the underlying spectral model , but it should be noted that this estimate is not very rigorous .    in our analysis of the trgb magnitude",
    "we have propagated the random and systematic errors on @xmath6 separately . however , for illustrative purposes we show in fig .",
    "[ errs]d the combined error .",
    "the surprising shape of the error on @xmath55 as a function of @xmath52 should not be taken as real .",
    "it is an artifact coming from the fact that a systematic model error was included in the figure only for tp - agb stars .",
    "the great majority of the brightest stars are tp - agb stars for which we use agb models .",
    "going towards fainter stars , the @xmath37 colour decreases and we mostly use blackbody fits , for which we have not included a systematic model error in the figure .",
    "the error on @xmath6 thus seems to decrease around the trgb .",
    "the contribution of the internal reddening for the magellanic clouds is on average only @xmath56 while the foreground reddening can be very high in the outskirts of the clouds .",
    "we have not attempted to correct our sample for extinction on a star by star basis .",
    "instead we correct all data for one overall extinction .",
    "we adopt @xmath57 as the average of known measurements ( westerlund @xcite ) for both clouds . adopting the extinction law by glass ( @xcite ) for the denis pass bands [",
    "@xmath58:@xmath59:@xmath60:@xmath61 = @xmath62:@xmath63:@xmath64:@xmath65 and @xmath66 we obtain @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . our approach to correct for dust extinction is a simple approximation to what is in reality a very complicated issue ( e.g. , zaritsky  @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss the effect of uncertainties in the dust extinction on our results in sections  4.4 and  5 . while this is an important issue in the @xmath0 band , the bolometric magnitudes that we use to determine the distance modulus",
    "are impacted only at a very low level .",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of a stellar population is a powerful tool to probe evolutionary events and their time scales .",
    "major characteristics of a stellar population are associated to bumps , discontinuities and slope variations in the differential star counts as a function of magnitude . however , for a proper interpretation of observed luminosity functions several important issues should be taken into account .",
    "these include the completeness of the sample of data , the foreground contamination with respect to the analyzed population , the photometric accuracy and the size of the sampling bins .",
    "the total number of objects involved plays an important role to make the statistics significant .    in most previous studies of the luminosity functions of stellar populations in clusters or galaxies , in either the optical or the nir ,",
    "limited statistics have been the main problem .",
    "the denis ( cioni et al .",
    "@xcite ) and 2mass ( nikolaev & weinberg",
    "@xcite ) samples provide the first truly large statistical sample in the nir of the magellanic cloud system .",
    "this wavelength domain is the most suitable to study late evolutionary stages such as the rgb and the agb . in the present paper",
    "we restrict the discussion of the luminosity function mostly to the trgb ; a more general discussion is given elsewhere ( cioni , messineo & habing 2000 ) .",
    "for the removal of foreground contamination we considered two offset fields around each cloud .",
    "the range of right ascension ( ra ) is the same for both the cloud and the offset fields ; it is the same of the dcmc catalogue ( section 2.1 ) . for the lmc",
    "the north field has @xmath70 and the south field has @xmath71 ; for the smc the north field has @xmath72 and the south field has @xmath71 .",
    "the lmc region itself was limited to the declination range @xmath73 , and the smc region to @xmath74 .",
    "[ dec ] shows the distribution versus declination of the sources in the sample , using bins of @xmath44 degrees .",
    "the foreground contribution clearly decreases toward more negative declinations , due to the difference in galactic latitude . the difference in number between the foreground contribution around the lmc and around",
    "the smc is consistent with the fact that the lmc is observed closer to the galactic plane than the smc is .",
    "the structure of the lmc is clearly wider than the one of the smc and this may contribute to create the strong declination trend around the lmc .    for each field and photometric band",
    "we constructed a histogram of the observed magnitudes ( thin solid curves in the @xmath75 panels of fig .",
    "[ tip ] ) .",
    "for the two different offset fields at each right ascension range the data were combined into one histogram .",
    "this offset ",
    "field histogram ( thin dashed curves ) was then scaled to fit the corresponding lmc or smc field histogram at bright magnitudes , for which almost all the stars belong to the foreground .",
    "subtraction yields the foreground  subtracted magnitude distribution for each of the clouds ( heavy solid curves ) . for comparison we also extracted from the catalogue an extended sample consisting of those stars detected in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 bands ( irrespective of whether or not they were detected in @xmath4 ) .",
    "this sample ( heavy dashed curves ) is complete to fainter magnitudes than the main sample , and therefore illustrates the completeness limit of the main sample .",
    "the resulting statistics of the subtracted lf are impressive , despite the restricted source selection .",
    "we proceed with a description of the major characteristics of the lf .",
    "the maximum corresponds to giants that lie on the upper part of the rgb .",
    "the decrease at fainter magnitudes is due to the selections applied to the data and to the decrease in sensitivity of the observations ( cioni et al .",
    "features like the horizontal branch or the red clump are too faint to be detected by denis . towards brighter magnitudes we encounter a strong kink in the profile , which we associate with the position of the trgb discontinuity .",
    "brightward of the kink follows a bump of objects which we discuss below . at very bright magnitudes",
    "the lf has a weak tail which is composed of stars of luminosity type i and ii ( frogel & blanco  @xcite ) , but the lf at these bright magnitudes could be influenced by small residuals due to inaccurate foreground subtraction .    to explain the bump brightward of the trgb discontinuity we cross  identified ( loup  @xcite ) the dcmc sources with the sources in some of the blanco fields in the lmc ( blanco @xcite ) . in the @xmath76 diagram",
    "there are two regions populated only by oxygen rich agb stars ( o  rich ) and by carbon rich agb stars ( c  rich ) , respectively .",
    "o  rich stars are concentrated around @xmath77 and have a constant color @xmath78 , and c  rich stars are concentrated around @xmath79 and around @xmath80 ( see fig .  [",
    "these tp  agb stars cause the bump visible in the lf .",
    "this bump should not be confused with the agb bump caused by e  agb stars ( gallart @xcite ) .",
    "[ agb ] shows an enlargement of figs .",
    "[ tip]c and [ tip]k ( continuous line ) .",
    "the dashed line refers to o ",
    "rich agb stars and the dotted line to c  rich agb stars selected in the @xmath76 diagram . in the case of the smc we selected regions with slightly bluer color and fainter magnitude to match the two groups of agb stars in the @xmath76 diagram , cf .",
    "[ agb ] also plots the lf ( thick line ) that results when we cross  identify our sample with the spectroscopically confirmed carbon stars by rebeirot et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in the smc .",
    "we found @xmath81 sources out of @xmath82 and we attribute the missing cross  identifications to the selection criteria that we applied to the dcmc data to obtain the sample for the present paper .",
    "it is interesting to note that at higher luminosities the distribution of the confirmed c  rich stars matches the distribution of c  rich stars selected only on the basis of @xmath4 and @xmath37 . at the fainter luminosities",
    "c  rich agb stars can not be discriminated from o  rich agb stars only on the basis of @xmath37 and @xmath4 because they overlap with the rgb , principally constituted by o  rich stars .",
    "theoretically stars climb the rgb with an expanding convective envelope and an hydrogen burning shell , while increasing the core ",
    "helium content , the central temperature , the central density , and the luminosity .",

    "@xcite ) ; intermediate mass stars ( @xmath85 ) are not affected by degeneracy at this stage and initiate helium burning quietly , when a suitable temperature and density are reached . the rgb transition phase between the two behaviors occurs when the population is at least @xmath86 gyr old and lasts roughly for @xmath87 gyr , determining an abrupt event in the population life time ( sweigart et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the helium ",
    "flash is followed by a sudden decrease in the luminosity because of the expansion of the central region of the star and because of the extinction of the hydrogen ",
    "burning shell , the major nuclear energy supply .",
    "the star reaches its maximum luminosity and radius ( in the rgb phase ) at the trgb , which also marks the end of the phase itself ( iben @xcite ) .",
    "mass stars with the same metallicity accumulate along the rgb up to a trgb luminosity of about @xmath88 ( westerlund @xcite ) ; the resulting rgb is quite extended .",
    "stars with masses just above the transition mass ( which discriminates between low and intermediate masses ) have a trgb luminosity as low as @xmath89 ( sweigart et al .",

    "agb when both the hydrogen and the helium shells are active .",

    "the agb evolution is characterized by a strong mass loss process that ends the phase when the outer envelope is completely lost .",
    "the maximum agb luminosity defines the tip of the agb ( tagb ) , with core mass @xmath90 and magnitude @xmath91 mag ( paczynski @xcite ) .      in the observed diagrams @xmath92 and",

    "@xmath99      the algorithm that we have used for the determination of the position of the magnitude @xmath100 of the trgb is described in great detail in appendix  a. the trgb discontinuity causes a peak in both the first derivative @xmath101 and the second derivative @xmath102 of the observed stellar magnitude distribution @xmath75 .",

    "@xcite ) one of the major sources of contamination on the trgb determination is the presence of a relative strong agb population .",
    "the magellanic clouds also have a strong agb population , but in our case this does not confuse the determination of @xmath100 .",
    "this is due to the large statistics available , and above all to the fact that tp ",
    "agb stars are definitely more luminous than the trgb .",
    "e  agb stars overlap with the rgb stars but there is no reason to assume , according to models , that they accumulate at the trgb .",
    "probably they distribute rather constantly and due to the very short evolutionary time scale we do not expect them to exceed more than @xmath22% of the rgb population .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the trgb generally depends on the metallicity and the age of the stellar population and therefore need not to be the same for the lmc and the smc .",
    "nonetheless , if we assume that such differences in trgb absolute magnitude are small or negligible , and if we assume that the extinction towards the lmc and the smc have been correctly estimated , then one may subtract for each photometric band the inferred @xmath117(lmc ) from the inferred @xmath100(smc ) to obtain an estimate of the difference @xmath118 between the distance moduli of the smc and the lmc .",
    "this yields the following results : @xmath119 ( @xmath0 band ) , @xmath120 ( @xmath2 band ) , @xmath121 ( @xmath4 band ) and @xmath122 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the dispersion among these four numbers is @xmath123 , which is somewhat larger than the formal errors . averaging the four determinations yields @xmath124 , where the error is the formal error in the mean .",

    "the fact that @xmath128 is modestly sensitive to variations in metallicity and age for the @xmath2 and @xmath33 bands implies that the values of @xmath126 derived in these bands may not be unbiased estimates of the true difference in distance modulus between the smc and the lmc .",
    "the @xmath0 band value should be better in this respect , but on the other hand , that value is more sensitive to possible differences in the dust extinction between the clouds .",

    "( see fig .  [ mag ] ) this generally yields on overestimate of the actual trgb magnitude . since nikolaev & weinberg do not describe their analysis technique in detail , it is difficult to estimate the size of this bias in their result .",

    "[ mag]a for any particular application , the value of @xmath190 along the abscissa should therefore not be taken merely as the average photometric error for the data , but should include the effect of the additional smoothing that was applied to obtain the estimate of either @xmath224 or @xmath226 . while photometric errors of a few hundredths of a magnitude are often routinely achieved , the additional smoothing or binning applied during data processing is often as large as 0.1 to 0.2 magnitudes . according to fig .",

    "one may wonder whether this could have had a systematic influence on the @xmath100 determinations . to assess this we applied our algorithm also to a different ( extended ) sample consisting of those stars that were detected in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 bands ( irrespective of whether or not they were detected in @xmath4 ) , which is complete to much fainter magnitudes than the main sample ( heavy dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ tip ] ) .",
    "the rms difference between the @xmath117 estimates from the main and the extended sample ( for those cases where both are available ) was found to be @xmath113 , which can be attributed entirely to the formal errors in these estimates .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no evidence for systematic errors due to possible incompleteness .",
    "our method for foreground subtraction ( see section  3.1 ) is based on an empirical scaling of the magnitude histogram for an offset field . to assess the effect of possible uncertainties in the foreground subtraction we have , as a test , done our analysis also without any foreground subtraction ( i.e. , using the thin solid curves in the @xmath75 panels of fig .",
    "[ tip ] ) .",
    "even this very extreme assumption was found to change the inferred @xmath100 values only at the level of @xmath276 , which can be attributed entirely to the formal errors in the estimates .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no evidence for systematic errors due to uncertainties in the foreground subtraction .",
    "extinction enters into our analysis in various ways .",
    "for the i , j and @xmath4 data we have performed our analysis on data that were not corrected for extinction . instead",
    ", we apply an average extinction correction to the inferred @xmath100 values after the analysis .",
    "obviously , any error in the assumed average extinction for the sample translates directly into an error in @xmath100 .",
    "table [ value ] lists for each band the shift in @xmath100 that would be introduced by a shift of @xmath115 in the assumed @xmath114 ( a shift of @xmath116 in the assumed @xmath114 would produce the opposite shift in @xmath100 ) .",
    "it should be noted that our analysis does not assume that the extinction is constant over the region of sky under study .",
    "if there are variations in extinction then this causes an additional broadening of the convolution kernel @xmath186 beyond what is predicted by observational errors alone .",
    "the width of the convolution kernel is not assumed to be known in our analysis , but is calibrated indirectly through our determination of @xmath106 ( the dispersion of the @xmath221 peak ) .",
    "hence , any arbitrary amount of extinction variations within the clouds will neither invalidate our results , nor increase the formal errors .    in our calculation of the bolometric magnitudes @xmath52 of the individual stars in our sample from the observed @xmath2 and @xmath4 magnitudes we do correct for extinction .",
    "the effect of a change in the assumed @xmath114 affects the inferred @xmath100 values in a complicated way , because both the magnitudes and the colors of individual stars are affected .",
    "we therefore performed our entire analysis of the @xmath52 histograms for three separate assumed values of @xmath114 , namely @xmath229 , @xmath127 and @xmath230 . from these analyses",
    "we conclude that an increase in @xmath114 of @xmath115 decreases the inferred bolometric @xmath100 by @xmath277 ( a shift of @xmath116 in the assumed @xmath114 would produce the opposite shift in @xmath117 ) . as for the @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 data , extinction variations within the clouds will not invalidate the results or increase the formal errors .",
    "most authors have searched for the magnitude @xmath224 of the peak in the first derivative @xmath223 to estimate the magnitude @xmath100 of the trgb discontinuity .",
    "while this is a perfectly good approach , it is important to realize that this by itself does not yield an unbiased estimate of @xmath100 .",
    "this was pointed out previously by madore & freedman ( @xcite ; see their fig .",
    "however , they were not overly concerned with this , since their aim was to test the limitations on determining @xmath100 to better than @xmath278 mag . as a result",
    ", it has not been common practice to estimate the bias @xmath279 intrinsic to @xmath224 and correct for it .",
    "[ mag]a also shows that for small values of @xmath190 one has @xmath280 , so the application of a correction may seem less important for methods based on the first derivative than for those based on the second derivative . on the other hand , it has now become possible to determine @xmath224 with formal errors of order @xmath44 mag or less ( e.g. , sakai , zaritsky & kennicutt @xcite ; nikolaev & weinberg @xcite ) , so it is important to correct for systematic biases even if one uses the first derivative , as we will illustrate .    to estimate quantitatively the size of possible biases in the results of previous authors one must do monte - carlo simulations for their exact observational setup and analysis procedure , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , as an illustration it is useful to consider the result of nikolaev & weinberg ( @xcite ) , who find from 2mass data for the lmc that @xmath281 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath282 in the denis photometric system , which conflicts significantly with our result @xmath283 ( see section  4.4 ) .",
    "nikolaev & weinberg derived their result from an analysis of the derivative of the observed magnitude distribution ; the latter is shown and listed as a histogram with @xmath87 mag .",
    "bins in their fig .  9 and table  1 .",
    "if they used the sobel edge detection filter suggested by madore & freedman ( @xcite ) on this histogram , then monte - carlo simulations that we have done ( similar to those in section  a.2 ) indicate that their estimate of @xmath224 could overestimate @xmath100 by as much as @xmath157 .",
    "if we correct their result for this bias , then we obtain @xmath284 for their data , in good agreement with our result .",
    "romaniello et al .",
    "( @xcite ) use a bin size as large as @xmath285 mag in their analysis , and their estimate of the trgb magnitude is therefore likely to be biased upward even more .",
    "our method differs from that employed by sakai , madore & freedman ( @xcite ) in that they employ kernel smoothing and estimate @xmath223 as a continuous function , while we employ histograms .",
    "sakai et al .",
    "quote as an advantage of their technique that it avoids the arbitrary choice of bin size and histogram starting point .",
    "while this is true , we have not found any evidence that this makes a significant quantitative difference .",
    "our monte - carlo simulations indicate that our results obtained from histograms are unbiased to better than 0.01 mag . , and we have found this to be true for all histogram starting points and a large range of reasonable bin sizes . however , we should point out that for this to be the case it is important to apply appropriate corrections for systematic biases ( which applies equally to histograms estimates and kernel smoothing estimates ) .",
    "a final issue worth mentioning is the estimation of the formal error in @xmath100 .",
    "we have done this through monte - carlo simulations , which is probably the most robust way to do this . by contrast ,",
    "sakai , zaritsky & kennicutt ( @xcite ) quote as the formal error the fwhm of the observed peak in @xmath223 .",
    "it should be noted that this is not actually accurate ( it is probably conservative ) .",
    "recall from section  a.1 that for the simplified case in which @xmath286 in eq .",
    "( [ taylor ] ) , one has @xmath287 .",
    "hence , the dispersion of the peak in @xmath288 measures the random error in the individual stellar magnitude measurements ( plus whatever smoothing was applied to the data ) .",
    "this dispersion is independent of the number of stars in the sample ( @xmath32 ) , and therefore can not be a measure of the formal error in @xmath100 . the true formal error ( i.e.",
    ", the dispersion among the results obtained from different randomly drawn samples ) scales with the number of stars as @xmath31 .",
