    "the scattering of rashba electrons at impurities is a source of magneto - transport properties .",
    "in particular we expect contributions to the planar hall effect ( phe ) , the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) as well as the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) . both the phe and ahe are observed as a voltage transverse to the applied current@xcite in contrast to the amr , which is measured in the longitudinal geometry .",

    "if we consider an fe impurity , the local density of states plotted as function of the energy ( see fig .",
    "[ density_of_states](a ) ) is characterized by a resonance at the fermi level for the minority spin channel and is flat for the majority spin channel .",
    "the broadening of the states is induced by the hybridization of the electronic states of the adatom and those of the substrate .",
    "in such a configuration , the scattering of the rashba electrons is essentially due to the minority spin channel .",

    "also we notice that as soon as the so coupling is finite , the magnetic and non - magnetic impurities induce different residual resistivities with the largest values obtained in the magnetic case .    to explain the strong drop of the residual resistivity as function of the so strength , we refer to eq .  , where one notices that the resistivity is inversely proportional to the square of the electron density , @xmath107",
    "this simply indicates that the more electrons are available , the more conducting the system becomes . in fig .",

    "this is expected considering the analytical form of @xmath107 as given in eq .   and using eq .   which leads to a quadratic form of @xmath107 with respect to @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "this intriguing dependence of @xmath107 on the so coupling strength can be traced back to the particular behavior of the density of states of the rashba electron gas , which is characterized by two regimes induced by so and defined by the two regions of the energy dispersion curve that show a crossing at @xmath180 ( see eq .  ) . at energies below the crossing",
    ", the corresponding density of states follows a quasi one - dimensional behavior where a van hove singularity occurs at the bottom of the bands . above the crossing ,",
    "the density of states is a constant as expected for a 2d electron gas . by increasing the so coupling strength ,",

    "this explains the strong drop of the residual resistivity when increasing the so coupling strength .",
    "now , we address the dependence of the residual resistivity on the magnetism of the impurity by analyzing the different scattering processes allowed at the fermi surface .",
    "the possible scattering processes can be found by evaluating @xmath182 , where @xmath183 are given in eq .  .",
    "if the impurity is non - magnetic , the @xmath68-matrix can be rewritten as @xmath184 and one can show that only intra - band transitions conserving the spin are allowed ( see fig .",

    "we notice that all transitions are allowed see fig.[fermi_surface ] ( b ) even the ones that flip the spin .",

    "now we turn to the analysis of the angular dependence of the resistivity anisotropy . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no phenomenological functional form for such a general angular dependence is available in the literature contrary to the case , for example , where the magnetization is lying in - plane  @xcite .",
    "therefore to simplify our analysis , we focus first on the particular orientation of the magnetic moment along the @xmath38-direction . there , the @xmath68-matrix is expressed as @xmath209 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 are the upper and lower diagonal components of the @xmath68-matrix when the magnetic moment points along the @xmath32-direction .",
    "as we will discuss below , this gives rise to a non - zero off - diagonal contribution in the resistivity tensor and contributes to the phe even without spin - orbit contribution at the impurity site .",
    "when the magnetic moment is in the surface plane ( @xmath212 ) , fig .",
    "[ 3d_res](c ) and ( d ) show the behavior of the diagonal and off - diagonal components of the resistivity tensor , respectively , as function of the azimuthal angle @xmath198 .",
    "the trace of the resistivity tensor is conserved under these azimuthal rotations ( @xmath213 ) while the off - diagonal components are related by @xmath214 .",
    "the diagonal components of the resistivity tensor ( fig .  [ 3d_res](c ) ) can be fitted with the amr functional form given by thompson@xcite : @xmath215 , where @xmath216 and @xmath217 define the residual resistivities when the moment is respectively parallel and perpendicular to the current . in our particular case , the current is pointing along the @xmath38-direction , thus @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath220 , _",
    "i.e. _ the maximal value of the amr , is a positive quantity as expected for a rashba electron gas @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by analyzing the different scattering processes on the fermi surface when the impurity magnetic moment is in - plane ( see figs .",
    "[ fermi_surface](c ) and ( d ) ) . as done previously , the idea is to evaluate the following scattering matrix elements : @xmath182 . here",
    "the @xmath68-matrix is written as @xmath221 . when the magnetic moment points along the current direction the back - scattering is due to inter - band and intra - band scattering .",
    "however when the magnetic moment is perpendicular to the current direction then the back - scattering is only originating from inter - band transitions , which induces a smaller residual resistivity and therefore gives a positive maximal value of the amr , i.e. @xmath222 .    the off - diagonal components of the resistivity tensor ( fig .  [ 3d_res](d ) ) could be fitted with the phe functional form @xcite @xmath223 we notice that for the considered polar angles @xmath224 , @xmath225 changes sign when @xmath198 crosses @xmath226 ( fig .  [ 3d_res](d ) ) .",
    "this is accompanied by a change of direction for the hall like electric field originating from the phe . the change in the sign of @xmath225",
    "reduce the energy dissipation @xmath122 given by eq .  [",
    "dissipation ] since @xmath227 are always positive .",
    "let us go back to the general case , where the magnetic moment points in arbitrary orientations .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a phenomenological functional form for the residual resistivity has not been proposed up to now .",
    "we found that the longitudinal and transversal parts can be well described by : @xmath228 @xmath229 an example of a perfect fit can be seen in fig .",
    "[ 3d_res](c ) and ( d ) when the polar angle @xmath230 ( black curve ) and @xmath231 ( red curve ) .",
    "using linear response theory , we have derived a formulation of the tensor of the residual electrical resistivity for the particular case of a rashba electron gas scattering at an impurity that can be magnetic and whose magnetic moment can point in any arbitrary direction . while the obtained form is general , we applied it to the case of an fe impurity deposited at the au(111 ) surface .",
    "we performed different types of studies and investigated the non - trivial impact of the strength of spin - orbit interaction of the substrate , the role of the magnetism of the impurity and of the orientation of the magnetic moment on the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the resistivity tensor .",
    "for instance , we found that after scattering , the planar hall effect and an anisotropic magnetoresistance occur even without incorporating the spin - orbit interaction at the impurity site if the orientation of the magnetic moment is not perpendicular to the surface .",
    "also an increase of the strength of spin - orbit coupling induces a dramatic drop of the resistivity , which is related to a peculiar behavior of the electronic states of the rashba electrons .",
    "magnetism can increase the residual resistivity because of the opening of additional scattering channels , which were prohibited in the non - magnetic case .",
    "we generalize the usual phenomenological functional forms of the angular dependence of the resistivity tensor elements to the cases where the magnetization points in arbitrary directions .",
    "finally , by switching - off the spin - orbit interaction , we find a simple formulation of the residual resistivity very close to the one given by friedel for a 3 dimensional electron gas  @xcite .",
