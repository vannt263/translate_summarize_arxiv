    "magnetic quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) constitute an intense area of current condensed matter research.@xcite similar to classical phase transitions , the universal critical properties of continuous qpt are determined by the symmetry of the order parameter and the number of space dimensions , @xmath3 , but in addition the order - parameter dynamics plays a distinctive role . the criterion for mean - field behavior , being @xmath4 for classical magnetic transitions , changes to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "thus , realizing quantum critical behavior beyond mean - field often requires low - dimensional systems , with effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) or two - dimensional ( 2d ) behavior .",
    "such reduced dimensionality may be achieved in structured materials , consisting of chains or planes with a weak three - dimensional ( 3d ) coupling : then , there exists an energy scale @xmath7 where the behavior crosses over from 3d at low energies to 1d or 2d at higher energies .",
    "a number of recent experiments suggested a different route to reduced dimensionality near magnetic qpt , namely through geometric frustration .",
    "one group of experiments are those on heavy - fermion metals,@xcite like cecu@xmath8au@xmath9 and ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 , undergoing a transition towards an antiferromagnetic metallic state , with properties inconsistent with the standard theory of 3d magnetic qpt in metals.@xcite some of the proposed theoretical explanations @xcite are based on the assumption of the spin fluctuations being two - dimensional .",
    "remarkably , indications for 2d critical fluctuations have indeed been found in neutron scattering @xcite on cecu@xmath8au@xmath9 at the critical concentration @xmath10 .",
    "more recently , experiments on mott - insulating quantum paramagnets consisting of coupled dimers of spins 1/2 have been performed .",
    "magnetic qpt can be driven either by application of a magnetic field or of pressure.@xcite the field - driven zero - temperature transition , from a paramagnet to an antiferromagnet with xy order at a field @xmath11 , belongs to the universality class of the dilute bose gas , and the corresponding finite - temperature transition has been termed as `` bose - einstein condensation of magnons '' . in the material",
    "bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1,@xcite the finite - temperature transition line has been found @xcite to follow @xmath12 , with a shift exponent @xmath13 characteristic of a two - dimensional quantum critical point ( qcp ) , in a temperature range of @xmath14 . as bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1  consists of layers of cu dimers with a fully frustrated inter - layer coupling , i.e. a body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) structure of dimers , the results have been interpreted as dimensional reduction at a qcp arising from geometric frustration.@xcite we have recently shown@xcite that frustration , while in general not leading to 2d behavior at asymptotically low energies , can strongly suppress the 3d crossover scale @xmath7 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath7 is reduced to @xmath15 , compared to an unfrustrated situation with @xmath16 ; here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are characteristic in - plane and inter - plane coupling scales .",
    "( we note that , at very low energies , additional ingredients like magnetic anisotropies and coupling to nuclear spins will modify the critical behavior of a real material . )",
    "returning to the compound bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1 , detailed neutron scattering experiments@xcite have revealed the existence of at least two magnetic `` triplon '' modes in zero field , indicating the presence of an enlarged unit cell with inequivalent dimers .",
    "in fact , the material undergoes a structural phase transition at a temperature of 100k , below which the magnetic layers are no longer equivalent.@xcite in such a situation , the application of a field will close the gap of the lowest triplon mode at @xmath19 , but the condensate will be strongly inhomogeneous along the @xmath2 axis , and hence effectively two - dimensional . an inhomogeneous condensate for fields above @xmath19 has indeed been found in a recent nmr experiment@xcite on bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1  which shows the existence of ( at least ) two inequivalent cu sites with distinct magnetizations .",
    "this discussion suggests _ two distinct routes _ towards critical points with reduced dimensionality in layered quantum magnets : ( a ) equivalent layers with perfect inter - layer frustration  this is the scenario proposed in ref .   and investigated theoretically in refs .  ; and ( b ) inequivalent layers@xcite  in this situation perfect frustration may still be present , but is not a required ingredient .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : first , we give a detailed discussion of situation ( a ) , augmenting the report given in ref .  .",
    "second , we study a model with two sets of inequivalent layers , i.e. , two dimers per unit cell , aiming at a semi - quantitative understanding of situation ( b ) .",
    "we shall show that qualitative differences between the cases with and without perfect frustration arise , allowing for a clear - cut experimental distinction .",
    "as in ref .  , our general arguments are based on an analysis of order - parameter field theories , and quantitative calculations are performed using variants of the bond - operator approach , in both the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "we shall be primarily interested in the mechanisms which suppress the 3d crossover scale to small values .",
    "the physics below this scale shall not be addressed in detail , as e.g. material - dependent anisotropies ( not included in our analysis ) will become important .",
    "= 1.1 in = 1.1 in = 1.1 in      in the following , we summarize our main results which strictly apply to a bct system of dimers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ) , but apply with minor modifications in general to magnetic systems with frustrated inter - layer interaction :    \\(i ) at the magnetic quantum critical points , the asymptotic low - energy physics below a scale @xmath7 is in general three - dimensional .",
    "however , the crossover scale @xmath7 is strongly reduced compared to unfrustrated layered systems , due to either ( a ) frustration , or ( b ) a layer `` mismatch '' arising from inequivalent layers .",
    "( an exception is the high - field quantum phase transition between a canted and a fully polarized state at field @xmath20 , where perfect frustration renders the low - energy physics two - dimensional , due to the lack of scattering processes at @xmath21.@xcite )    \\(ii ) perfect frustration implies the absence of a linear coupling between two distinct magnetic condensates ( on the even and odd layers ) , leading to an additional z@xmath0 symmetry which is spontaneoulsy broken in the ordered phases . for inequivalent layers , the two magnetic condensates will be established at different critical points , i.e. , the magnetic transition is generically split due to the absence of a proximity effect .",
    "this feature persists to finite temperatures and allows a distinction between perfect and imperfect frustration  in the latter case , the secondary transition is smeared out .",
    "\\(iii ) applied to the field - driven qpt in bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1 , our results suggest that scenario ( b ) , with inequivalent layers and incomplete frustration , is closest to the experimental situation . to demonstrate the qualitative differences , we plot in fig .",

    "we note that a recent paper by batista _ et al._@xcite studied in detail a hard - core boson model on a bct lattice ",
    "this is the appropriate model at the @xmath20 transition , and approximately applies also in the vicinity of @xmath19 , however , there it does not capture the interaction - generated 3d dispersion .",

    ".    a rather general form of the inter - layer coupling reads @xmath36 @xmath18 is the frustrated coupling between adjacent layers , whereas @xmath37 represents an _ unfrustrated _ coupling between second - neighbor layers .",
    "the @xmath38 runs over four spatial diagonals ( @xmath39 ) such that the sites @xmath40 and @xmath41 are nearest neighbors in @xmath6 direction , i.e. , with distance @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath2 are the lattice constants ( which are set to unity in the following ) .",
    "note that @xmath44 has some specific inter - dimer structure given by the @xmath45 dependence , and frustration can be broken due to the @xmath46 dependence , see below .",
    "the @xmath45 dependence requires discussion , as different physical processes are determined by different combinations of @xmath47 : the `` bare dispersion '' of the triplet excitations is determined by @xmath48 , whereas the combination @xmath49 enters in the interaction vertex .",
    "if we label the lower ( upper ) spin in each dimer with 1 ( 2 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]a , the geometry suggests that @xmath50 is dominant and antiferromagnetic .",
    "hence , in what follows we shall assume @xmath51 unless otherwise noted .",
    "occasionally we will refer to a possible biquadratic inter - layer exchange term : @xmath52    as we have shown in ref .",
    ", an effective second - neighbor inter - layer coupling is always generated ( @xmath53 ) through interaction processes , even if a `` bare '' @xmath37 is absent in an idealized model hamiltonian .",
    "( the same applies to the biquadratic term @xmath54 , with @xmath55 . ) in the microscopic calculations to be presented in this paper , we set @xmath56 unless otherwise noted .",
    "for an ideal bct lattice structure , all layers are equivalent , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the inter - layer coupling is fully frustrated , i.e. , the four diagonal bonds are equal , @xmath59 .",
    "importantly , the second - neighbor coupling in @xmath6 direction is allowed by symmetry,@xcite @xmath60 in general .",
    "distortions of the ideal bct lattice may or may not enlarge the unit cell . in the latter case ,",
    "particularly interesting are distortions which break the perfect inter - layer frustration .",
    "those correspond to a @xmath46 dependence of @xmath44 which renders the four links between one site and its neighbors in @xmath6 direction inequivalent .",
    "the simplest symmetry breaking leads to different couplings along the two diagonals , see fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]b .",
    "various lattice distortions can occur which enlarge the unit cell .",
    "this is likely the case in the low - temperature phase of bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1 , which , however , to our knowledge , has not been fully characterized to date . for simplicity and",
    "motivated by the bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1  neutron scattering results,@xcite we will assume that the distortions preserve the tendency towards commensurate in - plane ordering at wavevector @xmath61 ) , but we allow for layer - dependent in - plane couplings @xmath17 , @xmath62 and possibly broken inter - layer frustration .",
    "importantly , _ within _ the two sets of `` even '' and `` odd '' layers ( i.e. layers with even and odd @xmath32 ) a unfrustrated ( albeit small ) coupling will be present through @xmath37 , irrespective of the presence or absence of inter - layer frustration .",
    "thus the simplest and physically most interesting scenario is one where all even planes are identical , as are the odd ones , i.e. , we have a lattice still consisting of two tetragonal subsystems , labeled @xmath63 ( @xmath32 even ) and @xmath64 ( @xmath32 odd ) .",
    "then the couplings take the form : @xmath65 this also implies two different second - neighbor vertical couplings , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the coupling between adjacent layers may still have the full symmetry , @xmath59 , implying perfect frustration .",
    "alternatively , the distortion can break the frustration .",

    "all scenarios included above lead to a unit cell containing no more than two dimers ( one from the even and one from the odd layers ) . a further enlarged unit cell , i.e. , multiple dimers within each family of layers , only lead to quantitative modifications of the overall physics , and will be discussed towards the end of the paper .      to set the stage , we sketch the phase diagram of the coupled - dimer model @xmath72 ( ignoring the complications arising from structural distortions of the ideal bct lattice ) . at zero temperature",
    "the phase diagram is similar to that of the well - studied bilayer heisenberg model,@xcite see e.g. fig . 1 of ref .  .    for @xmath73 ,",
    "the zero - field ground state of @xmath72 is a paramagnetic singlet , with elementary gapped triplet excitations .",

    "this degeneracy is lifted for quantum spins by a zero - temperature order - from - disorder mechanism , which establishes true 3d order ( sec .",

    "in contrast , for large @xmath75 the in - plane order is ferromagnetic , with the inter - plane order depending on the sign of @xmath18 .",

    "applied to bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1 , we believe that the rather small value of the unfrustrated 3d dispersion scale ( @xmath380 mk ) may well be compatible with the observed @xmath163 ( which is roughly twice as large as the expected @xmath322 ) , as the frustrated part of the inter - layer coupling is likely significantly larger ( @xmath381 k ) and enhances @xmath163 as well .",
