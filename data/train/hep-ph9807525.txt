    "one of the primary science goals of the superkamiokande  @xcite , sno  @xcite , and icarus  @xcite solar neutrino experiments is to determine the shape of the solar neutrino spectrum between @xmath3 mev and @xmath4 mev . in this energy range ,",
    "neutrinos from the @xmath5-decay of @xmath6b are expected , according to solar model calculations carried out using the best available nuclear physics data , to dominate the solar neutrino spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the neutrino energy spectrum from a single @xmath5-decaying source is independent of all solar physics to an accuracy of @xmath7 part in @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "hence , a measurement of the shape is a direct test of whether something happens to the solar neutrinos after they are created , of the minimal standard electroweak model .",
    "the superkamiokande collaboration has provided  @xcite preliminary data for the energy distribution of recoil electrons created by solar neutrinos scattering off electrons in their detector .",
    "the data are presented in @xmath9 bins between @xmath10 mev and @xmath4 mev and one higher - energy bin , @xmath4 to @xmath11 mev , for a total of @xmath12 bins .",
    "the three highest energy bins show a relatively large number of events , more than would have been expected from the most popular neutrino oscillation parameters discussed prior to the first detailed report of the energy spectrum by the superkamiokande collaboration  @xcite .",
    "could this excess of high energy events be caused by @xmath1 neutrinos , which have an endpoint well beyond the @xmath13 mev endpoint of the @xmath6b energy spectrum ?",
    "the @xmath1 reaction , first discussed in connection with solar neutrinos by kuzmin  @xcite ,    @xmath14    produces neutrinos with an endpoint energy of @xmath15 mev , the highest energy expected for solar neutrinos .",
    "it was pointed out about a decade ago  @xcite that solar neutrino detectors that measure individual recoil electron energies , like superkamiokande  @xcite , sno  @xcite , and icarus  @xcite , might be able to detect the @xmath1 neutrinos .",
    "the total rate is expected to be low , but the background is small in this energy range .    the goal of this paper is to demonstrate the sensitivity of inferences regarding the distortion of the solar neutrino energy spectrum to assumptions regarding the low energy cross section factor , @xmath16 , for the hep reaction ( eq .",
    "[ [ hepreaction ] ] ) , and to emphasize the importance of experimental and theoretical studies of the possible contribution of @xmath1 neutrinos .",
    "for a given solar model , the flux of @xmath1 neutrinos can be calculated accurately once the low - energy cross section factor for reaction  ( [ hepreaction ] ) is specified .",
    "the rate of the @xmath1 reaction is so slow that it does not affect solar model calculations . using the uncertainties given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the solar age , chemical composition , luminosity , radiative opacity , diffusion rate , and for all nuclear quantities except @xmath16 , we calculate a total uncertainty in the @xmath1 flux of only @xmath17% if the @xmath18factor is known exactly .",
    "the best - estimate @xmath1 flux is very small  @xcite :    @xmath19   \\times 10 ^ 3~{\\rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}}. \\label{eq : hepflux}\\ ] ]    the bracketed - factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hepflux ] ) is equal to unity for the currently - recommended value for @xmath16 ( see discussion in the following section ) .    the best - estimate @xmath6b neutrino flux is more than @xmath20 times larger than the flux of @xmath1 neutrinos given by eq .  (",
    "[ eq : hepflux ] ) if the bracketed factor is set equal to unity .",
    "this is the reason why all previous discussions of the measurement of the energy spectrum in the superkamiokande , sno , and icarus experiments have concentrated on the recoil electrons produced by @xmath6b neutrinos . even with the high event rate of superkamiokande(@xmath21 solar neutrino events observed in @xmath22 days ) , only a few @xmath1 interactions are expected for the standard estimate of @xmath16 .",
    "table  [ table : cross ] lists all the published values of the low - energy cross section factor , @xmath16 , with which we are familiar .",
    "since reaction  ( [ hepreaction ] ) occurs via the weak interaction , the cross section for @xmath1 neutrinos is too small ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : hepvalue ] below ) to be measured in the laboratory at low enough energies to be relevant to solar fusion and must therefore be calculated theoretically .",
    "we have also given in table  [ table : cross ] , in the column next to each cross section estimate , one or more characteristic features of the physics that was used to estimate the cross section .",
    "a review of the history of calculations of @xmath16 provides insight into the difficulty of obtaining an accurate value .    the first estimate of the cross section factor by salpeter  @xcite considered only the overlap of an incoming continuum wave function with that of a bound nucleon in @xmath23he , obtaining a large value for @xmath16 , @xmath24 times the current best - estimate . however , werntz and brennan  @xcite pointed out that if one approximates the final @xmath23he state by @xmath25 and the initial state by @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is a continuum initial state ) , and antisymmetrizes in space , spin , and isospin , then the matrix element of the usual allowed @xmath5-decay operator vanishes between the initial and final states .",
    "they obtained a cross section factor more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the single - particle salpeter estimate .",
    "werntz and brennan  @xcite derived and used in an exploratory way a suggested proportionality between the @xmath5-decay matrix element , @xmath28 ( which can not be measured ) , for the reaction @xmath29he(p,@xmath30he , and the neutron - capture matrix element ( which can be measured ) , @xmath31 , for the reaction @xmath29he(n,@xmath32he .",
    "their derivation , which was intended only to give a crude estimate of the cross section factor , neglected initial state interactions and the small @xmath33state contributions of the @xmath29he and @xmath23he ground states and also assumed the dominance of meson exchange currents .",
    "tegnr and bargholtz  @xcite stressed the importance of the @xmath34-state components of the @xmath29he and @xmath23he wave functions and argued that the matrix elements for nucleon capture on @xmath29he are dominated by one - body operators rather than the two particle meson exchange terms .",
    "they derived a new proportionality relation between @xmath28 and @xmath31 , which they used to estimate a rather large range of possible values for @xmath16 .",
    "wolfs et al .",
    "@xcite and wervelman et al .",
    "@xcite measured accurately the thermal neutron capture rate for @xmath29he(n,@xmath32he and used the proportionality relation of tegnr and bargholtz to estimate values of @xmath16 .",
    "carlson  @xcite revealed another layer of complexity by performing a detailed calculation with sophisticated wave functions , showing the presence in their model of strong destructive interference between the mesonic exchange currents and the one - body matrix elements connecting the small components of the wave functions . in the most comprehensive calculation to date ,",
    "schiavilla et al .",
    "@xcite included a more consistent treatment of the @xmath35-isobar current and investigated the sensitivity of @xmath16 to the assumed details of the nuclear physics .",
    "they found a range of values    @xmath36    which corresponds to a fusion cross section of @xmath37 at solar thermal energies .",
    "the central value of this range , @xmath38 , was adopted by adelberger et al .",
    "@xcite and bahcall and pinsonneault  @xcite as the best available estimate . a value of @xmath16 in the range @xmath39 times @xmath40 would be consistent ( see discussion in the following section ) with all the available evidence from solar neutrino experiments .",
    "is it possible to show from first - principle physics that @xmath16 can not exceed , e. g. , @xmath41 times @xmath42 ? we have been unable to find any such argument .",
    "therefore , for the last decade we have not quoted a total uncertainty in the calculated standard model predictions for the @xmath1 neutrino fluxes , although well - defined total uncertainties are given for all of the other fluxes  @xcite .    the reason it is difficult to place a firm upper limit is , as emphasized by carlson et al .",
    "@xcite and schiavilla et al .",
    "@xcite , that the calculated value of @xmath16 is sensitive to the model used to describe both the ground sate and the continuum wave functions and to the detailed form of the two - body electroweak interactions .",
    "the matrix element @xmath28 contains separate contributions from both the traditional single particle gamow - teller operator and the axial exchange - current operator . in the most detailed calculations  @xcite , there is a delicate cancellation between comparable contributions from the one - body and the two - body operators .",
    "for example , if one artificially changes the sign of the principal exchange current contribution relative to the sign of the one - body axial current in the calculation described in table  iii of ref .",
    "@xcite , the size of the calculated @xmath16 is increased by a factor of @xmath43 .    for non - experts",
    ", it is instructive to compare the calculations of the @xmath44 and @xmath1 reactions .",
    "the @xmath44 fusion reaction  @xcite occurs via the allowed gamow - teller @xmath5-decay matrix element whereas the @xmath1 transition is forbidden . for the @xmath44 reaction , the difficult - to - evaluate mesonic exchange corrections and matrix elements connecting small components of the wave functions are only small corrections ( @xmath45 a few percent ) to the total cross section . for the @xmath1 reaction , the exchange corrections and matrix elements involving small components of the wave function are the whole story . for the @xmath44 reaction , the effective range approximation allows one to use measured data to calculate to good accuracy the low energy fusion cross section .",
    "the somewhat analogous scaling laws relating @xmath1 fusion to the measured cross section for @xmath29he(n,@xmath32he reaction are not valid because low energy nucleon capture by @xmath29he occurs via competing and cancelling small effects and because of different initial state interactions .",
    "hence , the estimated uncertainty in the low energy @xmath44 fusion cross section is small(@xmath46%  @xcite ) , whereas the uncertainty in the @xmath1 cross section is much larger and is difficult to quantify .",

    "[ [ eq : hepvalue ] ] ) for the low - energy cross section factor for the @xmath1 reaction is used in the standard solar model calculations .",
    "we have been unable to find an argument from first - principle physics that rules out values of the cross section factor @xmath16 that are as large as required by our best - fit solutions that are described in table  [ table : higherenergy ] .    at first glance , these results seem discouraging .",
    "if one allows a large @xmath1 flux to account for the enhancement at higher energies of the measured electron recoil energy spectrum  @xcite , then it would seem to be very difficult to infer anything fundamental about neutrino physics from the measured recoil electron energy spectrum .",
    "after all , to a good approximation the distortion of the spectrum can be represented for small distortions by a single parameter  @xcite and we are suggesting that an additional ( unknown ) parameter be added to the fit , namely , the magnitude of the @xmath1 flux .    fortunately , the superkamiokande  @xcite , sno  @xcite , and icarus  @xcite experiments can all test for the possible existence of a large @xmath1 flux by measuring the energy spectrum beyond the energy corresponding to the endpoint of the @xmath6b neutrino spectrum .",
    "table  [ table : higherenergy ] shows that solutions with a large admixture of @xmath1 neutrinos are expected to produce appreciable numbers of events more energetic than @xmath4 mev in the @xmath22 days of observations studied so far in the superkamiokande detector .",
    "the region beyond the endpoint energy of the @xmath6b spectrum is an excellent region in which to search for rare events since the background is expected to be very small between @xmath12 to @xmath11 mev",
    ".    the sno detector should be even more sensitive than superkamiokande at the highest electron energies because the neutrino absorption cross section on deuterium rises more rapidly with energy than does the electron scattering cross section and because higher energy neutrinos absorbed by deuterium produce higher energy electrons , whereas for @xmath78 scattering the energy is divided almost equally between recoiling electrons and final state neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , we estimate that sno would have , depending on which neutrino oscillation parameters are chosen , two to three times the rate of production of electrons in the @xmath64 mev bin if the energy resolution were the same in the two detectors",
    ". moreover , the energy discrimination for sno may actually be better than for superkamiokande , further helping in determining the possible contribution of @xmath1 neutrinos .",
    "the ratio , @xmath79 , of the number of detected events in the @xmath64 mev bin to the number of detected events in the @xmath65 mev bin should be large if  as predicted by the standard solar model the only important neutrino sources contributing to events in this energy region are @xmath6b and @xmath1 . for the best global fits ( large @xmath52 ) ,",
    "we see from table  [ table : higherenergy ] , that @xmath79 satisfies for superkamiokande operating characteristics      and for the standard @xmath16 , @xmath81 equation  ( [ eq : r1518 ] ) is a prediction , valid with or without neutrino oscillations , of the standard solar model and can be tested with the available superkamiokande  @xcite data . basically , eq .  ( [ eq : r1518 ] ) is a statement that there are no other important sources of high energy solar neutrino neutrinos except @xmath6b and @xmath1 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ralpha1 ] ) is valid if the current best - estimate for @xmath16 is correct .    for @xmath22 days of superkamiokande operation ,",
    "the best global fits predict ( see table  [ table : higherenergy ] ) about @xmath82 events in the @xmath65 mev energy bin , whereas the standard standard fluxes with @xmath83 predict @xmath84 or @xmath66 high energy events .",
    "many more events may be required before superkamiokande can distinguish empirically between the small and large @xmath52 descriptions of the energy spectrum .",
    "measurements at energies below the current @xmath10 mev lower limit are also very important .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitstospectrum ] shows that the best - fit vacuum solution has a small upturn in the spectrum at the lowest available energies .",
    "the upturn is intrinsic to this vacuum solution ; @xmath1 neutrinos are unimportant at the lower energies .",
    "solar neutrino experiments may be able to determine , after several years of operation , both the contamination ( at higher energies ) by @xmath1 neutrinos of the energy spectrum and also a strong constraint ( from measurements at lower energies ) on the allowed range of distortion parameters due to neutrino oscillations .",
    "we hope that the discussion in this paper will stimulate further experimental and theoretical considerations of the possible effects of @xmath1 neutrinos .",
    "we are grateful to the superkamiokande collaboration for making available at neutrino 98 their crucially important data on the electron recoil energy spectrum .",
    "we are also indebted to many members of the superkamiokande collaboration for informative and stimulating conversations on the possible relevance of @xmath1 neutrinos for their measurements .",
