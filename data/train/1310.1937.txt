    "the standard model ( sm ) has been extremely successful in explaining all the measurements till date in particle - physics experiments .",
    "the higgs boson , the long awaited last missing piece of the sm , has also been discovered recently in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment @xcite . at this moment",
    "the main goal of lhc will be to look for signals of new physics ( np ) and establish experimentally the existence of physics beyond the sm .",
    "while direct search experiments are extremely important in this endeavor , the flavor physics and other low energy experiments will play complimentary roles to the direct search experiments in particular , if the np scale is rather high or do not couple significantly to the first two generation of quarks .",
    "in fact , deviations from the sm expectations at the level of @xmath1 have already been reported in recent years in a few observables involving decays and mixing of @xmath2 mesons @xcite . on the theoretical side also various np explanations of these deviations have been suggested @xcite .",
    "the decays involving @xmath3 transition are particularly interesting as they are extremely rare in the sm and many extensions of the sm are capable of producing measurable effects beyond the sm .",
    "in particular , the three body decay @xmath4 offers a large number of observables in the kinematic and angular distributions of the final state particles and some of these distributions have also been argued to be less prone to hadronic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has recently measured four angular observables ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the notation of @xcite ) which are largely free from form - factor uncertainties , in particular , in the large recoil limit ( i.e. , low invariant mass , @xmath9 , of the di - lepton system ) .",
    "for each of the four observables , the data were presented in six @xmath10-bins and quite interestingly , a significant deviation of @xmath11 from the sm expectation was observed only in one of the bins ( @xmath12 gev@xmath13 ) for only one observable , the @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that there is still considerable amount of theoretical uncertainty due to ( unknown ) power corrections to the factorization framework @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a possibility that the observed deviation will be resolved once deeper understanding of these corrections is achieved . in this paper",
    "we take the observed deviation at the face value and study its possible explanation from physics beyong the sm .",
    "note that the observable @xmath6 is related to the observable @xmath14 defined in @xcite , see table .  1 in @xcite for a precise comparison .",
    "we would like to mention here that the observable @xmath14 is exactly the same ( apart from an overall normalization factor of 4/3 ) to the longitudinal - transverse asymmetry @xmath15 which we defined in our earlier work @xcite in the following way , a_lt = where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two of the total three angles ( the other angle @xmath18 is integrated ) in the full angular distribution of @xmath19 ( see fig .  9 in @xcite for a diagrammatic illustration ) .    in the sm ,",
    "the @xmath20 flavor transition is governed by the effective hamiltonian , _",
    "eff^sm = - ( v_ts^v_tb ) _",
    "i=1 ^ 10 c_i o_i and the decay @xmath0 proceeds via the three operators namely , _ 7 & = & m_b ( |s _ p_r b ) f^ , + o_9 & = & ( |s _ p_l b ) ( |^ ) and + o_10 & = & ( |s _ p_l b ) ( |^_5 ) with the corresponding wilson coefficients @xmath21 @xmath22 \\{0.3,4.1 , 4.3 } at the scale @xmath23 gev . in models beyond the sm new chirally flipped ( @xmath24 )",
    "operators @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 may also be generated .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that @xmath15 is particularly sensitive to the operators @xmath28 , @xmath26 , @xmath29 and @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , a global fit to the np contribution ( @xmath30 ) to the above six wilson coefficients taking into account the recent lhcb data along with the existing data on some other rare and radiative @xmath20 modes was performed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) with the conclusion that the deviations seen in the lhcb experiment can be explained by just adding a large negative contribution to the wilson coefficient @xmath31 , c_9 -1.5 .",
    "[ sol1 ] a similar fit to the wilson coefficients was also performed in @xcite with a slightly different conclusion .",
    "they reported the best fit solution to be the one with the presence of np contributions to both @xmath31 and @xmath32 , c_9 -1.0 , c_9 ^ 1.0 .",
    "[ sol2 ] note that the solutions above are rather unusual as most np models would in general produce not only new contributions to @xmath31 and @xmath32 but also to other operators .",
    "in fact , the new @xmath33 boson considered in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the data indeed had rather non - standard couplings to the fermions .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the scalar or pseudo - scalar operators of the form @xmath34 and @xmath35 can not explain the data owing to their very little effect on @xmath15 @xcite in particular , once the consistency with the measured branching ratio of @xmath36 is taken into account .    in this work",
    "we instead consider new four - quark scalar interactions that couple the third generation quarks .",
    "possible mixing in the quark sector then lead to flavor changing @xmath20 transitions .",
    "note that there is no direct contribution to the decay @xmath3 in this case but it can arise at the one loop level . as we will show explicitly in the next sections , in this way we can generate new contributions to @xmath31 and @xmath32 with negligible effect on the other operators .",
    "in fact , such four - quark scalar operators involving third generation of quarks are rather motivated after the discovery of the higgs particle and can arise in many extensions of the sm e.g. , topcolor models @xcite , r - parity violating susy and multi - higgs models @xcite .    the precise definition of the np operators will be given in the next section . in sec .",
    "[ bsmixing ] we will compute the constraints on these operators from @xmath37 mixing .",
    "their effect on the @xmath0 decays will be discussed in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] after making some concluding remarks .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , in this work we consider effective four - quark scalar interactions of the form , _",

    ". [ operator ] which are assumed to be generated by unknown short - distance physics beyond the sm .",
    "here @xmath38 is the scale of np and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the wilson coefficients which parameterize our ignorance about the underlying microscopic theory .    in order to proceed with our calculations",
    "we will not need to work with specific models that can generate these operators and hence , we will take eq .",
    "[ operator ] as the starting point of our phenomenological analysis .",
    "however , as an existence proof we briefly mention here the topcolor model of ref .  @xcite . in such models",
    "the top quark participates in a new strong interaction which is assumed to be spontaneously broken at some high energy scale @xmath38 . the strong interaction , though not confining , leads to the formation of top condensate @xmath41 resulting in scalar bound states in the low energy spectrum of the theory which couple strongly to the @xmath42 quark @xcite . integrating out these scalar bound states generates , in the weak interaction basis ( denoted by @xmath43 below ) , effective four fermion operator of the form ( 1+_5 ) b^(1-_5 ) b^ , with possibly rather large couplings @xcite .",
    "the above operator then generates the operators in eq .  [ operator ] once the quark mass matrices are diagonalized making @xmath44 dependent also on the mixing matrices of the left and right chiral down type quarks .",
    "the four - quark operators in eq .  [ operator ] will clearly contribute to the @xmath37 mixing at the one loop level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "taking one operator at a time , the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] will generate the following operators , & = & k_1 [ ( 1-^5)b][(1-^5)b ] and + o_2 & = & k_2 [ ( 1+^5)b][(1+^5)b ] , where the effective couplings @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given by , _",
    "1(2 ) = - ( ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     comparing eq .",
    "[ bsll ] with eq .",
    "[ operator ] we can now calculate the np contribution to the wilson coefficient @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this reads , [ c9 ] & & c_9 = + & & ^1_0 dx x(1-x ) \\{ln()-ln ( 1 - x(1-x ) ) } & & = + & & \\ { ( ) - ^1_0 dx x(1-x ) ln ( 1 - x(1-x ) ) } .",
    "the expression for @xmath47 can be obtained from eq .",
    "[ c9 ] after replacing @xmath40 by @xmath39 .",
    "although @xmath48 is a function of the di - lepton invariant mass @xmath10 , the variation in @xmath48 in the whole @xmath10 range is less than 1% and thus , we will neglect this variation below .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the contours of @xmath48 in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "the green shaded region above the red ( dotted ) contour satisfies the constraint @xmath50 2.5 ps@xmath51 .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] clearly reveals that the value @xmath52 can indeed be achieved keeping the @xmath37 mixing completely under control and for reasonable choices of @xmath40 and @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , turning on both the couplings @xmath39 and @xmath40 with opposite sign can even reproduce the solution in eq .",
    "in this paper we have studied the possibility of explaining certain deviations from the sm expectations in the angular distribution of the decay @xmath0 observed recently by the lhcb collaboration .",
    "we have shown that new dimension-6 four - quark operators of scalar and pseudo - scalar type can naturally account for these deviations without conflicting with other experimental measurements .",
    "this is in contrast to generic scalar 4-fermion operators that would in general give rise to new contributions to other decays like @xmath53 , @xmath54 etc . and hence would be very tightly constrained .",
    "we have also briefly mentioned how well known extensions of the sm can generate these dimension-6 operators .",
    "detailed phenomenological analysis of these models in particular , in view of the large amount of available experimental data , should be carried out and will be presented elsewhere .",
