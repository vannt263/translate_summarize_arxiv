    "recently hartle @xcite has emphasized the increasing importance of general relativity on the frontiers of both the very largest and the very smallest distance scales , a fact reflected by the increasing number of undergraduate physics majors being introduced to the subject . of course , one can only learn physics by doing it , but many of the standard functions of general relativity , when taught through classical tensor methods , involve only partial differentiation and summation .",
    "i believe that little is to be gained by repetitive routine calculations of this nature . for this reason ,",
    "i would like to introduce here a tool that will be of use for all students starting their study of general relativity .",
    "the purpose of the tool is to turn all standard ( tensor based ) functions into  elementary functions \" - those immediately available with the click of a button - so that the inner beauty of general relativity shines through .",
    "the tool described here involves and update @xcite to the java @xcite interface grtensorj @xcite .",
    "the workings of the interface have been described in detail previously @xcite .",
    "the version of grtensorj described here can not be run over the internet but rather is a local application .",
    "the interface currently covers every spacetime ( referenced by equation number and in notation as close to the original as possible ) in the following texts :    * carroll , sean .",
