    "i.e. , at the chemical freeze - out_. the grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble is defined in the large volume limit , so the volume parameter @xmath2 is an extensive coefficient in the expressions for such quantities as mean particle numbers controlled by the chemical potentials .",
    "application of the gc ensemble also implies that the number of produced particles carrying a conserved charge is sufficiently large . in this description the net value of a given charge ( e.g. electric charge , baryon number , strangeness , charm _ etc . _ ) fluctuates from event to event .",
    "these multiplicity fluctuations with respect to mean particle multiplicity can be neglected only if the particles carrying the charges are abundant , _ i.e. _ , for the system of a large volume and/or high temperature . here",
    "the charge is conserved on the average and , therefore , the gc description is adequate .    in the opposite limit of low production rate , fluctuations of the particle number can be as large as its event averaged value . in this case",
    ", the charge conservation has to be implemented exactly in each event .",
    "so the ensemble to be chosen is the canonical one .",
    "then , the @xmath2-independent fugacities are replaced by nonlinearly @xmath2-dependent canonical chemical factors .",
    "the exact conservation of quantum numbers introduces certain constraints on the system considered . in the formulation of thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter one needs to implement these constraints that are originally governed by internal symmetry of the hamiltonian  @xcite",
    "consequently , the equilibrium distribution of particle multiplicities can differ from that expected in the gc limit .    in principle , for an equilibrium system all conserved charges",
    "should be treated canonically . however , in a good approximation , baryonic and electric charge conservation can be considered grand - canonically even for high - energy @xmath3 collisions .",
    "this treatment results only in a slight overestimation of the canonical effects  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the importance of exact strangeness conservation for hadron production in heavy ion collisions has been clearly demonstrated some time ago in refs .",
    "@xcite , where closed expressions for suppression of chemical factors were derived in terms of classical maxwell - boltzmann statistics for the global strangeness neutrality condition @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    ", we reconsider the derivation of the strangeness constraint for nuclear systems with non - vanishing net strangeness @xmath5 applying two different methods for evaluating the partition function and ensemble averages : the direct method and the method of recurrence relations  @xcite . in the line of refs .",
    "@xcite , the second method allows us first to generalize our canonical strangeness evaluation to the case of quantum statistics .",
    "two appendixes contain details on the calculation of canonical quantities by recurrence relations .",
    "the derived formulae will be used to analyze the kaon excitation function from heavy ion collisions and particular attention will be paid to the discussion of an anomalous maximum of excitation functions at the beam energy near 30 gev . a new possible scenario of its formation as a manifestation of the critical end - point is advanced .",

    "we get @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the modified bessel function and variables @xmath52 taking into account eq.([16a ] ) we see that @xmath53 while @xmath54 are independent of the system volume . in specific calculations the maximal hadron strangeness @xmath55 is not large , which simplifies essentially eq.([19a ] ) , since the number of infinite sums is @xmath56 . in particular , for @xmath57 the partition function ( [ 19a ] ) can be expressed as follows  : @xmath58 where the symmetry property of the modified bessel function @xmath59 has been used .",

    "has been derived earlier in  @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath62 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the case of full canonical treatment of both baryon and strangeness @xmath63 in a little bit different technique was given in  @xcite .",
    "however , the electric charge conservation is taken into account by neither canonically , nor grand canonically .",
    "it simplifies calculations but the final result differs from our eqs.([21a])-([23a ] ) .",

    "let us subdivide the set @xmath67 of particles of all species into three sub - sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 according to the value of individual strangeness charge @xmath13 of involved hadrons .",

    "this finding may be an evidence of the softest point effect at the passage of the phase boundary .",

    ", one can compare the @xmath167 excitation function to those calculated within the maxwell - boltzmann ensemble but for different values of net strangeness @xmath5 of the hadronic system .",
    "it is not of purely academic interest .",
    "as was first noted in  @xcite , in the gibbs phase coexistence of a baryon - rich quark - gluon plasma there is strangeness separation in phases , the so - called _ strangeness distillation _ effect : while the net strangeness of the system is zero , the strangeness of its each component can differ from zero . in particular , in the quark subsystem , being a small admixture to the hadronic one , a number of strange quarks can be larger than that of strange antiquarks ( _ i.e. _ @xmath170 ) which should be compensated by hadronic phase ( _ i.e. _ @xmath171 ) .",
    "a similar situation may occur below the critical temperature for systems with crossover deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the distillation effect is even stronger for lower colliding energies , as recently shown in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the first order phase transition , here a small quark admixture can survive during the expansion stage until freeze - out . this may give rise to an observable effect if particles from each phase get on shell at freeze - out preserving their strangeness .",
    "one should remember that recent lattice qcd calculations with physical quark masses  @xcite tell us that at @xmath172 mev and @xmath173 mev there is the critical end - point where the crossover changes to a phase transition of the first order .",
    "it means that proceeding from high to lower energies ( see fig.1 ) , the hadronic subsystem follows along the curve for @xmath0 with @xmath171 strangeness components , then stops near the end - point and jumps down on the curve with @xmath4 .",
    "the given parameters of the critical end - point roughly correspond to the bombarding energy  @xmath1 gev  @xcite and correlate with the position of the maximum for the relative strangeness yield in fig.1 .",
    "therefore , in this scenario the observed maximum is treated as a manifestation of the critical end - point rather than a jump due to the latent heat at the first order phase transition .",
    "a change of the nature of phase transition at the critical end - point may manifest itself in other observables as well . since at this change",
    "the dominating hadronic phase of the quark - hadron mixture is enriched with strange antiquarks , effects should be more noticeable in the @xmath138 component .",
    "the derivation of the maxwell - boltzmann partition function and ensemble averages with the exact strangeness conservation has been reconsidered in a general case of non - vanishing net strangeness .",
    "a new method of recurrence relations was applied to solve the partition function .",
    "this method has certain advantages as compared to the numerical method used in  @xcite for the canonical description of baryon charge conservation of systems with the total baryon charge up to about 100 .",
    "the recurrence relation technique can be successfully applied to larger systems , as it was earlier demonstrated by a canonical treatment of statistical multifragmentation of excited heavy nuclei  @xcite .    using the recurrence relations method we first generalize the calculation scheme for the strangeness canonical ensemble to the case of quantum ensemble .",
    "taking into account quantum statistics , the @xmath0 ratio turns out to be slightly lower at collision energies @xmath174 gev .    in the present approach the general behavior of the @xmath0 experimental excitation function",
    "is reproduced roughly to the same level of agreement as that in earlier statistical treatments .",
    "uncertainties related to a possible contribution of weak decays and energy dependence of dynamic correlation volume are pointed out .",
    "while the initial state of the equilibrium system is taken from the chemical freeze - out @xmath160 curve , an additional account of the baryonic and electric charge conservation does not change noticeably the particle ratio but provides the thermodynamic consistency of the strangeness canonical approach .",
    "the obtained unique system volume is energy dependent and exhibits clear minimum near @xmath175 gev , which deserves further investigations .",
    "nevertheless , the anomalous increase of this ratio near the bombarding energy of about 30 gev , having been interpreted as a sign of deconfinement phase transition , is not reproduced by this model .",
    "a new scenario based on the strangeness distillation idea has been proposed where this anomalous strangeness enhancement is considered as a sign of the evolving system passing in vicinity of the critical end - point .",
    "arguments in favor of this hypothesis are given . in this respect ,",
    "multiplicity fluctuations of rare strange particles can be a measure of chemical equilibrium  @xcite , and therefore are of special interest .",
