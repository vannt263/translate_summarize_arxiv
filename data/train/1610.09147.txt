    "the quest for closed geodesics in compact riemannian manifolds has been one of the main themes in the modern history of differential geometry .",
    "such problem , dating back at least to h. poincar @xcite , has been approached by a variety of methods , whose development turned out to be remarkably useful in the most diverse fields . among these",
    ", special importance is deserved by the curve - shortening scheme proposed by g. birkhoff @xcite in order to construct simple closed geodesics on manifolds whose fundamental group is trivial , so that minimization methods are not successfully applicable . the ideas behind this approach turned out to be crucial in the development of min - max methods for the area functional , which allowed almgren and",
    "pitts @xcite to show existence of at least one closed embedded minimal hypersurface in any compact manifold of dimension less than six ( which was later extended to higher dimensions by schoen and simon @xcite ) . in turn",
    ", these methods proved to be extremely powerful in tackling a number of fundamental questions in geometry , like the willmore conjecture @xcite , the freedman conjecture on the energy of links @xcite , the yau conjecture on minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds of positive ricci curvature @xcite and ( most recently ) the problem of constructing new classes of ( higher genus ) solitons for the mean curvature flow @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "we refer the reader to the beautiful icm lectures by f. marques @xcite and a. neves @xcite for a broader overview and contextualization of these methods .",
    "+ a somehow analogous question , also of global nature , is that of existence of geodesic lines : given a ( non - compact ) riemannian manifold @xmath0 we wonder about the existence of ( proper ) geodesic embeddings @xmath1 . in general , the answer to such a question depends , in a dramatic fashion , on the topology and on the asymptotic structure of @xmath0 .",
    "simple existence theorems are only at disposal when the problem is approachable by minimization methods , that is to say by taking limits of length - minimizing geodesic segments for endpoints escaping at infinity in some appropriate fashion .",
    "this approach does indeed work , for instance , if @xmath0 has suitable convexity properties at infinity .",
    "when these sorts of assumptions are not made , trying to construct geodesic lines by solving a sequence of minimization problems will not work as there are in general no geometric reasons for the sequence of geodesic segments one may construct not to escape from any given compact subset of the manifold in question .",
    "in fact , this is the typical behaviour on positively curved manifolds for in that case the second variation of the length functional ensures that no stable geodesic lines can actually exist .",
    "an important class of surfaces that exhibit this phenomenon is provided by asymptotically conical ones , which arise as asymptotically flat models in @xmath2 gravity ( see e. g. @xcite and @xcite ) . in that context",
    "non - negativity of the scalar curvature is just a reflex of the dominant energy condition ( dec ) and the non - existence of embedded , stable geodesic lines is the two - dimensional counterpart of a well - known obstruction disclosed by schoen - yau in their proof of the positive mass theorem @xcite and recently widely investigated in its connections to the large - scale structure of isolated gravitational systems @xcite .",
    "+ in spite of the fact that minimization methods are doomed to fail , we shall prove here that every asymptotically conical surface does in fact contain lots of ( properly ) embedded geodesic lines , whose morse index equals one under natural curvature conditions .",
    "[ thm : maingeod ] an asymptotically conical surface of non - negative scalar curvature contains infinitely many , geometrically distinct , properly embedded geodesic lines of morse index less or equal than one .",
    "if the scalar curvature is assumed to be positive equality holds .",
    "we refer the reader to subsection [ subs : acs ] for a precise definition of asymptotically conical surface and for recollection of a few basic facts .",
    "a brief discussion of the positive mass theorem in two spatial dimensions is provided in subsection [ subs : pmt2 ] , instead .",
    "+ in order to avoid dangerous misunderstandings , let us remark here that the geodesic lines we construct are _ never _ length - minimizing ( in other terms : they are not _ straight lines _ ) for otherwise the ambient manifold @xmath3 would of course split as a riemannian product ( by virtue of the well - known theorem by s. cohn - vossen @xcite , later exetended by cheeger - gromoll @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , our result ensures that complete , embedded geodesics that are not length - minimizing exist in abundance under very natural assumptions on the asymptotic behaviour of the ambient manifold .    in the statement of theorem [ thm : maingeod ] the assumption that the scalar curvature be non - negative forces the surface in question to be a complete plane ( namely : to have only one end and genus zero ) ,",
    "see theorem [ lem : pmt2 ] . however , this is not restrictive ( as far as one is concerned with the existence problem ) for in presence of at least two ends one can just obtain properly embedded geodesic lines by taking a limit of minimizing segments whose endpoints diverge on different ends of the surface in question . in fact , a similar strategy allows to deal with the case when the surface contains a non - separating closed curve and thus solves the problem when the genus is not zero ( see e. g. @xcite pg .",
    "it is important to contextualize our result with respect to the rich history concerning the quest for _ escaping rays_. for a broad overview , with several remarkable contributions , of the study of maximal geodesics on complete surfaces we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein .",
    "the question of existence of proper geodesic embeddings @xmath1 for @xmath4 a riemannian manifold homeomorphic to the plane was explicitly posed by s. cohn - vossen in 1936 .",
    "after various sorts of partial contributions , it was then finally solved by v. bangert in 1981 ( see @xcite , as well as @xcite and references therein for related and ancillary results ; see also proposition 6.1 in @xcite for a refined existence result for planes of finite positive total curvature ) .",
    "yet , the arguments employed to answer such question in full generality are rather indirect and provide little information on the geodesic line whose existence is proven and in particular do not provide any information at all about the morse index of the line itself .",
    "the author needs to distinguish various cases , depending on whether the surface does contain a closed geodesic or not . in this respect , bangert states",
    "( in @xcite , p. 59 ) : _ we have not been able to find a general method to conctruct escaping geodesics without self - intersection .",
    "_ in this paper , we present an effective geometric construction in the category of asymptotically conical surfaces , a category naturally arising in the physical setting described above . perhaps more importantly , bangert concluded his article with the following question :    _ are there infinitely many escaping geodesics on every complete plane @xmath5 ? _",
    "while very exhaustive results have been achieved in the case of _ negatively curved planes _",
    "( see @xcite ) , the problem is still far from being completely understood for what concerns positively curved metrics on @xmath6 .",
    "our work provides a novel contribution in this direction , since in fact the argument we describe in section [ sec : bangert ] shows that for every couple of opposite half - lines on our surface we can exhibit an embedded geodesic line whose two ends are asymptotic , in a suitable sense which we shall describe later , to those half - lines .",
    "+ the proof of theorem [ thm : maingeod ] naturally splits into two parts , the full conclusion following at once by combining proposition [ prop : existence ] ( for the _ existence _ part ) and proposition [ prop : multiplicity ] ( for the _ multiplicity _ part ) . in the next two paragraphs we shall briefly outline them . + the geodesic lines we construct are obtained by min - max methods .",
    "more precisely , we exploit the information on the asymptotic behaviour of our ambient surface to set - up a sequence of plateau min - max problems ( for geodesics ) and then check that the sequence of geodesics with boundary we obtain can not drift off to infinity together with their boundary points .",
    "let us now describe the structure of our proof in more detail .",
    "for the first step ( which is done in section [ sec : finscale ] ) , we prove that whenever one can join two points on a surface by means of two embedded geodesics that bound a disk _ and _ the standard mountain - pass condition holds then there is a third embedded geodesic joining the two points in question ( proposition [ prop : finscale ] ) .",
    "of course , such condition is automatically satisfied when the two geodesics that are given are strictly stable .",
    "this result , of independent interest and potentially wide applicability , relies on the combined use of the _ one - dimensional _ @xmath7-gradient flow and , perhaps more importantly , on the clever _ resolution of singularities _ procedure proposed by g. chambers and y. liokumovich @xcite in order to effectively convert homotopies into isotopies . for the scope of controlling the index ,",
    "we have found it convenient to work with the energy functional ( rather than the length functional ) , somehow in the spirit of the parametric approach to the min - max plateau problem proposed long time ago by shiffman @xcite and morse - tompkins @xcite .",
    "the fact that the embedded geodesic segments that we produce do not escape from any given compact set is proven by using the gauss - bonnet theorem and a blow - down procedure ( since _ all _ geodesics connecting two antipodal points at the same height on a cone are known ) .",
    "this _ no - drift _ argument , which lies at the core of this construction , is presented in section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "+ at that stage , we prove that this method does in fact produce _",
    "uncountably many _ distinct geodesic lines . roughly speaking , this is achieved as follows .",
    "the min - max geodesic segments we produce connect ( by construction ) couple of _ antipodal _ points in the asymptotic region , where one has coordinates @xmath8 and each geodesic line is obtained as a ( subsequential ) geometric limit as the first coordinate of such points goes to infinity , with the second coordinate fixed to values @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in principle",
    ", one expects that as we vary @xmath9 we should indeed obtain distinct geodesic lines , but this is not obvious as _ twisting phenomena _ may occur without leading to any contradiction by means of a direct blow - down procedure .",
    "the relevant argument , which proves proposition [ prop : multiplicity ] , is described in section [ sec : bangert ] .",
    "+ when considering our work in the context of min - max techniques , one direction we should mention is the development of methods for contructing closed ( or , more generally , finite area ) minimal hypersurfaces in non - compact riemannian manifolds , due to bangert @xcite and thorbergsson @xcite for the special case of finite length geodesics on certain non - compact surfaces ( of finite area ) and , much more recently , remarkably extended by montezuma @xcite ( resp .",
    "chambers - liokumovich @xcite ) to handle closed ( resp .",
    "finite area ) minimal hypersurfaces in classes of manifolds satisfying various types of asymptotic geometric conditions .",
    "our scope here is rather different : while our setting is also non - compact , we aim at constructing variational objects which are themselves non - compact and for which the relevant functional ( in our case : the energy functional ) attains infinite value , thereby providing an obstacle of new and peculiar nature .",
    "in fact , the next step in our programme is precisely the extension of the methods presented here in the special case of geodesics to the construction of complete ( non - compact ) minimal hypersurfaces in suitable classes of non - compact riemannian manifolds . + _",

    "now , it is a direct , straightforward check that in fact @xmath468 has also index less or equal than one as a critical point of the length functional @xmath328 ( for if not we could reparametrize two @xmath155-orthogonal variations that decrease the length into variations by constant speed in which category @xmath469 and so those would be two orthogonal variatons that decrease the energy , contradiction ) .",
    "hence , @xmath398 does also have morse index less or equal than one due to locally graphical , smooth ( geometric ) convergence of @xmath470 to @xmath398 with multiplicity one .",

    "we need a definition and a simple lemma .",
    "[ def : ray ] given a properly embedded line @xmath480 , we call _ ray _ a closed , unbounded connected component of @xmath77 .    in particular , it follows that a ray can be parametrized by means of a map @xmath481 .",

    "then , one can find an identification of @xmath5 minus a suitable compact set with the outer portion of a euclidean wedge of angle @xmath276 ( with pointwise identification of the sides , see remark [ ref : wedgecoor2 ] ) , a large constant @xmath483 and a defining function @xmath484 whose cartesian graph in question has natural euclidean coordinates @xmath485 , where of course @xmath486 , and so the cartesian graph of a function @xmath487 is meant to be the set @xmath488 .",

    "this assertion can be proved by observing that the geometric assumption of vanishing geodesic curvature , namely @xmath491 , implies @xmath492 and hence noticing that such decay rate ( by integrability of @xmath493 when @xmath57 ) ensures uniqueness of the tangent cone at infinity of @xmath494 and hence the indefinite extension of a local graphical description of such support , with the claimed expansion .",

    "now , the claimed non - twisting phenomenon can be phrased as follows :    [ prop : multiplicity ] let @xmath3 be an asymptotically conical surface ( in the sense of definition [ def : acon ] ) and let @xmath482 be a properly embedded geodesic ray , asymptotic to the half - line @xmath495 .",
