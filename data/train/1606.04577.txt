    "spiral waves have been studied now extensively for a few decades since the pioneering work of winfree @xcite .",
    "one of the most important reasons why they have been given so much attention is the mounting evidence that in electrophysiological tissue ( such as the myocardium , the visual cortex or the brain ) , spiral waves are typically symptomatic of pathological conditions such as fibrillation , hallucinations or epileptic seizures @xcite .    a large class of mathematical models in which spiral waves occur as solutions are reaction - diffusion partial differential equations ( rdpdes ) on planar domains @xmath1 where @xmath2 may represent for example electric potentials of different ions through cellular membranes , or concentrations of chemicals . the @xmath3 constant matrix @xmath4 determines diffusion coefficients , and @xmath5 is the laplacian .",
    "the smooth function @xmath6 describes the local reaction kinetics of the model , and @xmath7 are model parameters .",
    "when ( [ basicrdpde ] ) is posed on the whole plane , this equation admits an important symmetry property ) also admits reflectional symmetries , but these will not be relevant for the purposes of this paper . ] : whenever @xmath8 is a solution of ( [ basicrdpde ] ) , then so is @xmath9 for any angle @xmath10 in the circle group @xmath11 , and any @xmath12 . in the jargon of dynamical systems",
    "theory , we say that the right - hand side of ( [ basicrdpde ] ) is _",
    "@xmath0-equivariant _ , where @xmath0 designates the group of all planar translations and rotations .",
    "barkley @xcite was the first to recognize the importance of @xmath0 symmetry in describing the dynamics and bifurcations of spiral waves which were observed in numerical simulations of ( [ basicrdpde ] ) and in physical experiments @xcite .",
    "essentially , barkley argued that the continuous symmetries of @xmath0 should lead to low - dimensional ( finite ) ordinary differential equations models to describe the basic modes of propagation of spiral waves : uniform spatial rotation of the spiral wave around a fixed point in space , or two - frequency epicyclic meandering spiral waves , where the tip of the spiral wave rotates around a point which itself precesses ( see for example figures [ grideffects ] and [ fig2 ] below ) .",
    "later , sandstede , scheel and wulff @xcite proved mathematically how barkley s finite dimensional models are , in fact , center manifold reductions of ( [ basicrdpde ] ) in the context of infinite - dimensional @xmath0-equivariant dynamical systems .",
    "see also @xcite . in this context , rigidly rotating spiral waves are examples of _ relative equilibria _ , and two - frequency epicyclic meandering waves are examples of _ relative periodic solutions _",
    "( see @xcite for the precise mathematical definitions of these concepts ) .    in any real physical situation",
    ", it is clear that @xmath0 symmetry is , at most , an approximation .",
    "boundaries , non - planar geometry , inhomogeneities and anisotropy ( which are all important in the electrophysiological contexts alluded to earlier ) break translational and/or rotational symmetries .",
    "moreover , there are several experimental studies illustrating how broken translational and/or rotational symmetries may lead to dynamic states for spiral waves which are inconsistent with euclidean symmetry : anchoring of spiral waves around regions of inhomogeneities @xcite , drifting along boundaries @xcite , and phase - locking and/or drifting of two - frequency meandering waves in the bidomain model of cardiac electrophysiology @xcite .",
    "these experimental observations led to a program of research @xcite which sought to use the theoretical apparatus of the center - manifold theorems of @xcite to characterize generic effects of _ forced symmetry - breaking _ on relative equilibria and relative periodic solutions . as a basic paradigm",
    "to illustrate forced symmetry - breaking from @xmath0 , consider the following perturbation of ( [ basicrdpde ] ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a small parameter and @xmath15 is some bounded function which depends non - trivially and explicitly on the spatial coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 . whereas ( [ basicrdpdepert ] ) admits full @xmath0 symmetry when @xmath18",
    ", it typically only admits a subgroup @xmath19 when @xmath20 , however small @xmath14 may be .",
    "depending on the physical situation that one wants to describe , the subgroup @xmath21 is prescribed in advance . using this approach , it was shown in @xcite that spiral anchoring , boundary drifting , and phase - locking and/or drifting of meandering waves in anisotropic media are generic consequences of forced symmetry - breaking from @xmath0 to @xmath21 , for appropriate choices of @xmath21 . in some sense",
    ", we can view the dynamical system generated by ( [ basicrdpdepert ] ) with @xmath20 as being close to an @xmath0-equivariant dynamical system , so we expect solutions of ( [ basicrdpdepert ] ) to retain some of the features of the @xmath0 symmetry ( at least on a transient level ) , as well as features of a @xmath21-equivariant dynamical system .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we studied the case where @xmath21 in ( [ basicrdpdepert ] ) is the group of rotational and translational symmetries of a regular square lattice .",
    "specifically , we characterized the effects of this symmetry - breaking on relative equilibria ( i.e. uniformly rigidly rotating spiral waves , or linearly translating waves with retracting tip ) .",
    "the motivation was two - fold .",
    "first , whenever an rdpde model such as ( [ basicrdpde ] ) is used to describe electrophysiological waves , it is understood that this continuum model is obtained after some averaging and homogenization over the cellular structure of the tissue .",
    "however , if the size of the spiral wave ( e.g. spiral step size ) is comparable to the size of the cellular structure , then inhomogeneities generated by gap junctions between cells may have an influence on the dynamics of the spiral wave .",
    "see for example figure [ retina ] ( taken from @xcite ) which illustrates the spatial distribution of cones in a cross section of the human retina . as a first approximation",
    ", one may assume that the cells are arranged in a square grid , although one could argue that in certain regions of figure [ retina ] , perhaps a hexagonal grid is closer to reality . in any event ,",
    "our goal is to characterize the generic first order effects of a lattice structure on spiral dynamics , so the specific geometry of the lattice ( i.e. square vs hexagonal ) is secondary in light of this .",
    "we choose a square lattice to simplify the presentation , and for the second motivation described below .",
    "a second motivation to study square lattice symmetry - breaking from @xmath0 is to try to characterize effects of coarse spatial grids on the resolution of spiral wave dynamics in numerical simulations of ( [ basicrdpde ] ) .",
    "although the rdpde ( [ basicrdpde ] ) enjoys full @xmath0 symmetry , numerical integration schemes which involve finite difference spatial discretization possess only the symmetries of the lattice .",
    "so it is not unreasonable to expect that numerical integrations of ( [ basicrdpde ] ) may reflect features which are characteristic of this grid symmetry , while still being `` close '' to being fully @xmath0 symmetric @xcite .",
    "this is especially true if the grid is coarse in relation to the size of the spiral . as an illustration of this point , in figure [ grideffects ] below",
    ", we show the path of the tip of a meandering spiral wave for four different numerical integrations of the fitzhugh - nagumo system @xmath22 { \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}}&=&{\\displaystyle \\tau ( u+\\beta-\\gamma v ) } \\end{array } \\label{fnpdeup}\\ ] ] on the domain @xmath23 ^ 2 $ ] using a finite difference scheme ( explicit in time ) with varying grid sizes , and neumann boundary conditions . in particular , there is phase - locking of a four - petal closed meandering path for a coarse grid , and this is inconsistent with euclidean symmetry @xcite .    ) on the domain @xmath23 ^ 2 $ ] using a finite difference scheme ( explicit in time ) with varying grid sizes : @xmath24 ( top left ) , @xmath25 ( top right ) , @xmath26 ( bottom two figures ) .",

    "when @xmath18 , ( [ fnpde ] ) reduces to ( [ fnpdeup ] ) , and is symmetric under the planar group of rotations and translations , @xmath0 .",
    "we will consider functions @xmath38 of the form @xmath39 where the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 will vary from simulation to simulation .",
    "therefore , when @xmath20 , the @xmath0 symmetry of ( [ fnpde ] ) is broken , but the rotational and translational symmetries of a square lattice are preserved . simulations with more harmonic components and/or with sine components were also performed , but did not lead to any dynamics significantly different from that obtained using ( [ gspecif ] ) .    for the perturbation functions @xmath42 in ( [ gspecif ] ) , system ( [ fnpde ] ) is invariant under transformations which are combinations of translations along the @xmath16 or the @xmath17 directions by integer multiples of @xmath43 , and rotations around the origin by @xmath44 .",

    "vii.2 of @xcite and get the conclusion .",
    "* interpretation * : in fully @xmath0 symmetric dynamical systems ( such as ( [ fnpde ] ) with @xmath18 ) , modulated travelling waves are not structurally stable .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 of @xcite , where modulated travelling waves occur only on a line ( dashed curve ) in the @xmath369 parameter space of ( [ fnpde ] ) with @xmath18 and @xmath28 .",
    "ashwin , melbourne and nicol @xcite explain this as a codimension 1 drift bifurcation on group orbits of solutions to @xmath0-equivariant dynamical systems .",
    "theorem [ transverse ] implies that under certain conditions , it is possible for a lattice symmetry - breaking perturbation in ( [ fnpde ] ) to render modulated travelling waves structurally stable .",
    "figure [ linperts ] appears to illustrate this phenomenon . in this figure",
    ", we show the meander paths for three numerical simulations of ( [ fnpde ] ) using the same kinetic parameters as those of figure [ fig3 ] ( homogeneous case ) , but with inhomogeneity data ( [ gspecif ] ) given by @xmath370 and same initial condition for all three simulations . this figure should be compared and contrasted to figure [ fig3 ] .    ) with inhomogeneity data given by ( [ coefflin1 ] ) and same initial condition in all three cases .",

    "discrete spatial structures are arguably the fundamental building blocks of nature . in electrophysiological tissue , these structures are arrays of excitable cells coupled together through gap junctions . in many instances , treating these structures as a homogeneous continuum , and deriving partial differential equations based on this assumption ( using homogenization techniques ) is a reasonable low - order approximation , and leads to many successful predictions about the system being modelled . however , if the solutions we are interested in studying display features that are of a size comparable in order to the cellular structure , then the continuum assumption may not be of sufficient complexity to capture the dynamical properties of these solutions .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations of spiral waves in homogeneous rdpdes using coarse spatial discretization may introduce spurious dynamical properties , which are inconsistent with a homogeneous model .",
    "this paper is an attempt to characterize certain generic , qualitative phenomenological effects that a lattice structure may induce on meandering spiral waves in two - dimensional excitable media . as was the case in previous studies",
    "@xcite , we have shown that a weak lattice perturbation has stabilizing ( in physical space ) effects on the meandering motion , alters the spatio - temporal symmetry properties of the meander path , and can lead to phase - locked solutions .",
    "we also presented what we believe to be a previously undocumented case for spiral wave meandering : the so - called `` fattened '' @xmath262-petal flower which originates in a hopf bifurcation from a phase - locked @xmath262-petal epicyclic meandering wave .    as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", one could make a compelling case that perhaps different geometries of lattices would be more appropriate in certain arrangements of excitable cells ( e.g. hexagonal ) .",
    "however , the purpose of this paper was not to describe any one physical situation in particular , but to gain an understanding of how spatially organized discrete structures may affect spiral wave dynamics .",
    "certainly , one could repeat the analysis of this paper , replacing the square lattice by a hexagonal lattice .",
    "we expect that the number theoretical aspects of which meander paths get anchored at lattice points , as well as spatio - temporal symmetries would change , but we do nt expect any fundamentally new qualitative results .",
    "one could also adopt a purely discrete approach , for example studying spirals in lattice dynamical systems ( lds ) @xcite .",
    "but then one would lose the aspect that much of the observed spiral wave dynamics are driven by and originate in euclidean symmetry .",
    "this is one of the advantages of our forced symmetry - breaking approach : we are in a sense studying systems that interpolate the fully euclidean continuum rdpde , and completely discrete lds .",
    "we thus expect that the results presented herein will be important in the as of yet largely unexplored study of meandering spiral waves in two - dimensional lds .",
    "we also note that the reduction of the infinite - dimensional problem ( [ ade ] ) into the finite - dimensional center - bundle equations ( [ cb - sys ] ) requires a spectral gap condition in hypothesis [ hyp2 ] . while this hypothesis holds for a large variety of spirals ( such as decaying amplitude spirals )",
    ", there is also a large family of spirals for which they do nt , including archimedean spirals .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough discussion on these spectral issues .",
    "even if the spiral does not decay ( e.g. archimedean spirals ) , the center bundle odes apparently still describe remarkably well many of the experimentally observed dynamics of the wave .",
    "thus , the study of euclidean - equivariant odes on finite - dimensional non - compact manifolds , and their perturbations , is a central idea in the study of the dynamics and bifurcations of spiral waves , and it is the one we have adopted here .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that one of the strengths of our approach in this paper is also perhaps one of its weaknesses , depending on one s purpose . by adopting a model - independent approach as we have done here ( i.e. computations and analysis driven mostly by symmetry considerations )",
    ", we capture some robust generic features of the effects of lattice symmetry - breaking for a large class of mathematical models , without much consideration for the finer details of the models .",
    "the most important requirement is that we have a mathematical model where spiral waves are known to exist , and the model is weakly heterogeneous in space , with heterogeneities on a lattice . so in this sense , our results are potentially broad in applicability .",
    "however , one can imagine situations where it may be important , when studying a specific model ( e.g. rdpde such as ( [ fnpde ] ) ) , to know the explicit link between the model parameters ( e.g. @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath14 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and the quantities which arise in the center - bundle equations ( [ cb - sys ] ) . as mentioned earlier in this paper in remark [ remark24](a ) , although such a link theoretically exists , it is in practice usually unfeasible to explicitly compute this link , unless one has explicit knowledge of the mathematical representation ( e.g. algebraic formula ) for the spiral wave .",
