    "observations with the _ einstein _ , and missions have revealed several isolated , radio - quiet neutron star ( ns ) candidates in supernova remnants ( see brazier & johnston 1998 , for a recent review ) .",
    "these objects are characterized by a lack of observable radio emission , thermal - like x - ray spectra with typical ( blackbody ) temperatures of @xmath6  k , and very high ratios , @xmath7 , of the x - ray to optical fluxes .",
    "their x - ray radiation has been interpreted as thermal radiation from cooling nss .",
    "the reason for the lack of observable radio emission remains unclear .",
    "the simplest explanation is that these nss are ordinary radio pulsars whose rotational and magnetic axes are unfavorably oriented so that the pulsar beam can not be seen at earth .",
    "an alternative explanation is that these objects are not active radio pulsars due to , e.g. , too low magnetic fields or too slow rotation .",
    "another option is that these nss belong to the class of anomalous x - ray pulsars , also radio - quiet , slowly rotating nss which apparently have superstrong , @xmath8@xmath9  g , magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , vasisht & gotthelf 1997 ) . to choose among these hypotheses",
    ", one should know the rotation period and its derivative , which would allow one to estimate the object s age and magnetic field .",
    "however , many attempts to find periods in the x - ray radiation of these sources have been unsuccessful so far , which indicates that the pulsed fraction may be too low to distinguish between a signature of the true periodicity and a noise fluctuation in a relatively short observation with a small number of photons collected . on the other hand , increasing the observational time strongly increases the number of trial periods ( and period derivatives in the case of very long observations ) .",
    "this not only makes the search prohibitively expensive , but also increases the probability of obtaining large noise fluctuations , which hampers detecting the true periodicity .",
    "if two or more timing observations of a source have been carried out , well separated in time , with good time resolution and sufficient amounts of photons collected , one may use additional constraints to discriminate between true and false periodicity signatures in the separate timing data .",
    "we applied such an approach to searching for periodicity of the x - ray brightest , radio - quiet ns candidate rx  j08224300 in the supernova remnant ( snr ) puppis a , making use of pspc and hri observations .",
    "puppis a is one of three known oxygen - rich snrs in the galaxy .",
    "its kinematic age , @xmath10  kyr , was estimated from the proper motion of fast - moving filaments in the northeast quadrant of the snr ( winkler et al .",
    "its distance , @xmath11  kpc , was estimated from vla observations in the @xmath1221 cm hydrogen line in the direction of puppis a ( reynoso et al .",
    "the central compact source was seen in the _ einstein _ hri images , located @xmath13 from the kinematical center of snr expansion ( petre et al .",
    "petre , becker & winkler ( 1996 ; hereafter pbw96 ) analyzed hri and pspc observations ( exposure times 4  ks and 6  ks , respectively ) and suggested that this source is an isolated ns born in the supernova explosion .",
    "it has no optical counterpart to limiting magnitudes @xmath14 , @xmath15 , which implies an x - ray / optical flux ratio @xmath16 .",
    "no obvious radio counterpart was detected to a 3@xmath17 upper limit of 0.75  mjy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "fitting the pspc spectrum of the source with the blackbody model gives a temperature of @xmath18  kev , somewhat higher than @xmath19  kev expected from standard ns cooling models .",
    "the corresponding blackbody radius of @xmath20  km is smaller than the expected radius for a ns .",
    "no evidence for pulsations with a pulsed fraction larger than 20% was found .",
    "new observations of puppis a and its central source with the and have been performed recently .",
    "we used these data for further investigations of the spectrum and the light curve of the ns candidate .",
    "results of the spectral investigation will be published elsewhere ( zavlin , pavlov , & trmper 1998b ) .",
    "briefly , they show that the temperature and radius of the ns are compatible with standard models if to assume that the ns surface is covered with a hydrogen / helium atmosphere ( cf .",
    "zavlin , pavlov , & trmper 1998a ) . fitting",
    "the observed spectra with the ns atmosphere models indicates that the surface magnetic field may be rather high , @xmath21  g , so that one can expect that the ns magnetic poles are hotter than the equator ( greenstein & hartke 1983 ) , which may lead to observable modulation of the thermal x - ray flux .",
    "among several observations of puppis a in the public archive at heasarc / gsfc , two are suitable for searching for periodicity of the central source .",
    "the first one was carried out with the pspc on 1991 april 16 ( 6.0  ks useful exposure , 53  ks total time span between the beginning and the end of the observation ) . in that observation",
    "the ns was off - set by @xmath22 .",
    "the background - subtracted count rate is @xmath23  s@xmath2 ( @xmath24  s@xmath2 after applying the dead - time and vignetting corrections ) . for the period search",
    ", we used 1368 counts extracted in the 0.12.4  kev range from a @xmath25 radius aperture .",
    "another useful observation was carried out with the hri on 1995 november 28 ( 30.7  ks useful exposure , @xmath26  ks total time span ) .",
    "we evaluated the background - subtracted source count rate , @xmath27  s@xmath2 ( @xmath28 after the dead - time correction ) .",
    "an analysis of the radial distribution of the source counts does not show significant deviations from the hri point spread function for a point source . to reduce the background contamination , we used 1968 counts collected from a @xmath29 radius aperture centered at the point source ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the hri observations of 1991 and 1992 were too short ( 2.4 and 1.5  ks , respectively ) to collect enough point source photons .",
    "was also observed with the gis ( 1993 july ) , but a too low time resolution , 65.2  ms .    to search for periodicity of rx  j08224300",
    ", we converted the spacecraft clock ( scc ) arrival times of the hri and pspc photons to utc times , and then to barycentric dynamical times ( tdb ) .",
    "the scc - utc conversion was performed with a fourth order polynominal fit of the scc calibration points to utc .",
    "the fit residuals were within a 3  ms range ; this corresponds to a scatter in pulse phase @xmath32 for frequencies @xmath33  hz .    to perform a global periodicity search of sparse data , tests based on @xmath34 statistics ( @xmath35 is the number of harmonics included ) look most appropriate ( buccheri et  al .",
    "1983 ; de jager 1994 ) . since the point source spectrum is likely of a thermal origin ( pbw96 ; zavlin et al .",
    "1998b ) , the pulse profile is expected to be smooth , with main contributions coming from the first harmonic , as observed in thermal x - ray radiation from radio pulsars ( e.g. , anderson et al .",
    "1993 ) and predicted by ns atmosphere models ( shibanov et al .",
    "this means that the @xmath36 ( rayleigh ) test should be optimal for the periodicity search : the ephemeris parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are estimated as the values that give the largest value of @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 is the total number of events analyzed , @xmath41 is the phase , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the trial ephemeris parameters , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the event arrival time counted from an epoch of zero phase .",
    "if the arrival times are uniformly distributed ( periodic component is absent ) , then the probability density function of @xmath36 is equal to that of a @xmath44 with two degrees of freedom , with both the mean and the standard deviation equal to 2 .",
    "the expected ( mean ) number of peaks with @xmath45 in @xmath46 statistically independent trials is @xmath47 .",
    "this means that if a maximum value of @xmath36 in an @xmath48 domain is such that @xmath49 , periodicity at the corresponding @xmath37 and @xmath50 can be established at a confidence level of @xmath51 .    for a sinusoidal signal with frequency @xmath52 , frequency derivative @xmath53 , and pulsed fraction @xmath54 , the mean and the standard deviation of the peak value @xmath55 can be estimated as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , provided @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "this means that the periodicity can be established at a high confidence level @xmath60 only if @xmath40 and @xmath54 are so large , and/or @xmath46 so small , that @xmath61 .",
    "if the quantity in the left - hand side of this inequality is not small enough , the peak corresponding to the true ephemeris parameters may be comparable to , or even lower than statistical fluctuations of @xmath36 at other values of @xmath37 and @xmath50 .",
    "in this case , the true parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 can not be determined reliably from a single observation .",
    "the number @xmath46 of statistically independent trials is determined by the domain of @xmath37 , @xmath50 values chosen for the search , and by the time span @xmath62 of a given observation .",
    "if @xmath63 , then @xmath64 is almost independent of @xmath50 , and one can use a one - dimensional ( frequency ) grid at a fixed @xmath50 from the range chosen .",
    "the number of independent trials is @xmath65 , and the number of grid points should be greater by a factor of @xmath66 , in order not to miss the peak . in the opposite case ,",
    "@xmath67 , one has to use a two - dimensional @xmath48 grid , with @xmath68 and the number of the grid points of @xmath69 .    a reasonable @xmath48 domain for a young , isolated",
    "ns is @xmath70  hz , @xmath71  hz  s@xmath2 . the 3  ms accuracy of the scc - utc conversion hampers detection of high - frequency modulation , so that we choose a conservative upper limit , @xmath72  hz . for the @xmath48 domain chosen , @xmath36 is practically independent of @xmath50 for the pspc observation ( @xmath73 ) , contrary to the hri observation ( @xmath74 ) , and the numbers of independent trials are @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively . because of the enormous number of the two - dimensional grid points needed for the blind periodicity search in the hri data , we have to start from investigating @xmath36 for the pspc events , the first step of our timing analysis .",
    "we put @xmath77 and calculated @xmath78 at equally spaced @xmath79 frequencies in the range @xmath80@xmath81  hz .",
    "the result is not encouraging  the highest peak , @xmath82 , is not much higher than several other peaks ( @xmath83 , 29.8 , 29.1 , 27.8 ) , and the probability that @xmath84 for uniformly distributed arrival times is as large as 0.18 .",
    "although any one of these peaks could be caused by real pulsations , with an expected pulsed fraction @xmath85 for a sine - like pulse profile , the corresponding confidence level would be too low ( e.g. , 82% , or 1.3@xmath17 , for @xmath86 ) to claim the periodicity is detected .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that only an upper limit on the pulsed fraction , @xmath87 , can be established from the pspc data alone , in accordance with pbw96 .",
    "however , with one more set of timing data available , we can examine whether the separate pspc @xmath36 peaks correspond to hri @xmath36 peaks at reasonably shifted frequencies .",
    "if a pspc peak at @xmath88 is caused by a periodic signal , then @xmath36 calculated with the hri arrival times should have a peak at a frequency @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the time in the tdb scale between the epochs ( start times ) of the pspc and hri observations .",
    "if such a peak is not found for reasonable values of @xmath50 , we have to conclude that the pspc peak under examination is most likely a statistical fluctuation .",
    "thus , the second step of our analysis is a conditional search for periodicity in narrow strips of the @xmath91,@xmath50 plane .",
    "the width of the strip along the @xmath91 axis , @xmath92  hz , is determined by the uncertainty of @xmath93 due to the finiteness of the time span .",
    "the size of the strip along the @xmath50 axis is merely @xmath94  hz s@xmath2 .",
    "the number of statistically independent trials for each of the strips can be estimated as @xmath95 , which corresponds to confidence levels @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) . only for one pspc peak ,",
    "@xmath98 at @xmath99  hz , a highly significant ( @xmath100 , or @xmath101 ) hri counterpart was found , @xmath102 at @xmath103  hz and @xmath104  hz  s@xmath2 .",
    "the digits in parentheses indicate uncertainties , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , of the last digits of @xmath37 and @xmath50 , where @xmath107 is a phase resolution ( cf .",
    "mattox et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the values of the pspc and hri ephemeris parameters are for the ( tdb ) epochs @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively . the period and its derivative , for the latter epoch , are @xmath110  ms , @xmath111  s  s@xmath2 . to verify that the pspc and hri @xmath36 peaks are indeed associated with",
    ", we applied the @xmath36 test to comparable numbers of off - source events in the pspc and hri observations and obtained @xmath36 values close to the mean value expected for a nonpulsed signal .    -2truein",
    "1truein    -2truein    figure  1 shows the frequency dependences @xmath78 at fixed @xmath112 for the pspc and hri data .",
    "the main ( highest ) peaks at @xmath113 are accompanied by a few side peaks at @xmath114  hz ( @xmath115 ) , caused by exposure gaps associated with the revolution around earth with the period of 96.0  min .",
    "both the main and the side peaks have an additional fine structure with characteristic `` periods '' @xmath116  hz and @xmath117  hz .",
    "similar coherent structures can be also seen in the dependence of the hri @xmath36 on @xmath50 at a fixed @xmath37 , with a shortest `` period '' @xmath118  hz  s@xmath2 .",
    "figure  2 shows the pulse profiles extracted by folding the arrival times with the ephemeris parameters obtained for the pspc and hri data sets .",
    "each of the curves is drawn for the corresponding epoch , which causes the apparent phase shift .",
    "this shift could be eliminated by combining the pspc and hri events in one set and determining the ephemeris parameters with a much higher accuracy , but the total time span , @xmath119  s , is so long that this can not be done unequivocally .",
    "we verified that there is no statistically significant difference between the shapes of the pspc and hri pulses .",
    "the light curves binned in 12 phase bins have broad maxima consistent with a thermal origin of the x - ray flux .",
    "the powers of higher harmonics are small in comparison with @xmath36 ( 3.2 vs. 30.5 and 1.0 vs. 27.3 ) , which demonstrates the pulse profile shape is close to a sinusoid and justifies _ a posteriori _ our choice of @xmath36 as a test statistic . to estimate the pulsed fractions , we applied the bootstrap method proposed by swanepoel , de beer & loots ( 1996 ) and obtained @xmath120 and @xmath121 for the pspc and hri light curves , respectively .",
    "we also calculated the pspc pulse profiles at lower and higher photon energies ( 0.11.1 and 1.12.4 kev ) and found no statistically significant phase shift or difference of the pulse shapes .",
    "with the period and its derivative evaluated , it is straightforward to estimate the pulsar s age , magnetic field , and rotational energy loss . assuming a pulsar spin - down equation @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the braking index and @xmath124 , the characteristic ( dynamical ) pulsar s age equals @xmath125=16.0/(n-1)$ ]  kyr , provided that the rotational rate at the ns birth was much greater than its current value , @xmath126 . for @xmath127 , corresponding to a simple magnetic - dipole braking , we obtain @xmath128  kyr . if we accept that the true pulsar age coincides with the the kinematic age of the snr , @xmath10  kyr , then the braking index should be @xmath129 . to match the pulsar s age and the kinematic snr age at @xmath130 , observed for the youngest radio pulsars psr b0531 + 21 , b054069 , b150958",
    ", @xmath131 should be within a 16.818.9  hz range ( @xmath13259  ms ) . a remarkably similar situation with the snr / pulsar age and the braking index",
    "is found for psr j16175055 near the snr rcw  103 ( torii et al .",
    "1998 ; kaspi et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the conventional `` magnetic field '' of the pulsar , derived from the standard formula @xmath133  g ( e.  g. , manchester & taylor 1977 ) , equals @xmath134  g for a standard moment of inertia , @xmath135  g  @xmath136 , and a ns radius of 10  km . the rotational energy loss can be estimated as @xmath137  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "the parameters inferred for are close to those of the vela pulsar , @xmath138  ms , @xmath139 , @xmath140  kyr , @xmath4  g , @xmath141  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "these results indicate that rx  j08224300 may be a regular radio pulsar whose radio - quiet nature can be explained by an unfavorable orientation of the pulsar beam .",
    "contrary to the radio flux , the x - rays observed from rx  j08224300 originate from the whole ns surface ( zavlin et al .",
    "1998b ) , their pulsation with @xmath142 may be due to anisotropy of the surface temperature distribution and magnetized atmosphere radiation .",
    "however , it is expected that the lower is the frequency , the broader is the radio beam .",
    "therefore , deep radio observations at low frequencies could detect rx  j08224300 , as it has happened recently with geminga ( kuzmin & losovsky 1997 ; malofeev & malov 1997 ) .    such a young , energetic pulsar is expected to power a pulsar wind nebula , either in the form of a plerion or a bow shock .",
    "the images show two `` blobs '' , @xmath143 north and @xmath144 south of the ns , with luminosities @xmath145  erg  s@xmath2 in the range ; the blobs are apparently connected to the ns with strips of lower brightness .",
    "in addition , the  gis image at higher energies , @xmath146  kev , reveals a structure resembling a bow - shock nebula , about @xmath147 east of rx  j08224300 .",
    "although these structures might be manifestations of the pulsar activity , one still can not firmly exclude that they belong to the snr and are not physically associated with the pulsar .",
    "future x - ray and radio observations of and its environment are needed to elucidate the nature of these structures .",
    "it is our pleasure to thank rob petre , the referee , for very valuable comments .",
