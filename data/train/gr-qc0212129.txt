    "the first generation of kilometer - scale gravitational wave ( gw ) laser interferometric detectors with sensitivity in the frequency band 10 hz to few khz and ultra cryogenic bar detectors sensitive at frequencies around 1 khz will start collecting data soon .",
    "the tama 300 ( tsubona 1995 ) has already done the first large scale data acquisition ( tagoshi et al .",
    "2001 ) , while ligo ( abramovici et al . 1992 ) and geo600 ( danzmann 1995 ) have recently carried out their first science observations .",
    "virgo ( bradaschia et al . 1991 ) may become operational in couple of years . also , an eighty meter research interferometer aciga ( mccleland et al . 2000 ) near perth , australia is under construction , hoping that it may be possible to extend it to multi - kilometer scale in the future .    at present",
    ", majority of searches are focussed in the detection of _ chirp _ and burst signals .",
    "however interest for the search of continuous gravitational wave ( cgw ) signals from the output of detectors is growing ( jaranwoski , et .",
    "al 1998 , jaranowski & krlak 1999 , 2000 ; astone et al . 2002 ; brady et .",
    "1998 , brady & creighton 2000 ) due to the possibility of enhancing the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) by square root of observation time @xmath1 . an optimistic estimate suggests that the earth based laser interferometric detectors may detect such signals with an observation time of 1-yr .",
    "the strength of the cgw largely depend on the degree of long - lived asymmetry in the source .",
    "there are several mechanism for producing such an asymmetry ( pandharipande et al . 1976 ; bonazzola & gourgoulhon 1996 ; zimmermann & szedenits 1979 ; zimmermann 1980 ) .",
    "the estimates of the asymmetry in neutron stars shows that the amplitude of cgw may be @xmath2 .",
    "hence , long integration will be required to get the signature of signal .",
    "but this in turn induces several other problems viz .",
    "doppler modulation and non - stationarity of the detector noise .",
    "consequently data analysis becomes more harder .",
    "however , doppler modulation will provide the information of position of the source in the sky .",
    "it has been realized that with present computing power , coherent all - sky full frequency search in the bandwidth ( bw ) of the detector of a month long data is computationally prohibitive .",
    "some computationally efficient alternative approaches have been suggested viz .",
    "_ tracking _ and _ stacking _ ( brady and creighton 2000 ; schutz 1998 ) . _",
    "tracking _ involves the tracking of lines in the time - frequency plane built from the fourier transform ( ft ) of one day long stretches of data while _ stacking _ involves dividing the data into day long stretches , searching each stretch for signals , and enhancing the detectability by incoherently summing the ft of data stretches .",
    "also , accurate modeling of gw form , optimal data processing and efficient programming are an integral part of all sky - search .    the basic method to analyze the detector output to get the signature of gw signals rely on how efficiently one",
    "can fourier analyze the data .",
    "fourier analysis of the data has the advantage of incorporating the interferometers noise spectral density .",
    "the problem for the search of cgw largely depend on how accurately one can take into account the translatory motion of the detector acquired from the motions of the earth in solar system barycentre ( ssb ) frame .",
    "it has been shown ( srivastava and sahay 2002a , b ) that amplitude modulation will only redistribute the power of the frequency modulated ( fm ) signal in five frequency bands @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath4 and @xmath6 are the frequencies of the fm signal and the rotational frequency of the earth respectively .",
    "hence it is sufficient to consider only fm signal for the analysis of the matching of signals from different locations in the sky .",
    "the study of the matching of signals from locations in the sky that differ in their co - latitude and longitude by @xmath0 radians has been made for 1-d data set ( srivastava and sahay 2002c ) .",
    "they observed symmetries in the sky locations . in this paper",
    "we report that the observed symmetries are not generic .",
    "we study this problem for longer observation time and the other parameters which affect the symmetries . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the ft of fm signal . in section 3 , using the concept of fitting factor ( ff ) , we investigate the matching of signals in an all sky - search with reference to the earth based laser interferometric detector by considering the source location as the parameter of signal manifold and templates corresponding to different source locations for longer observation time .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the time dependence of the phase of a monochromatic cgw signal of frequency @xmath7 observed at detector location is given as ( srivastava and sahay 2002a ) @xmath8\\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2\\pi f_o t + { \\cal z}\\cos ( a\\xi_{rot } - \\phi ) +   { \\cal n}\\cos ( \\xi_{rot } - \\delta ) -",

    "@xmath16 represent the obliquity of the ecliptic and the velocity of light .",
    "@xmath17 is the colatitude of the detector .",
    "here @xmath18 represents the time in s elapsed from the instant the sun is at the vernal equinox and @xmath19 is the local sidereal time at that instant , expressed in radians .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the celestial colatitude and celestial longitude of the source .",
    "these coordinates are related to the right ascension , @xmath22 and the declination , @xmath23 of the source via @xmath24    the two polarisation states of the signal can be taken as @xmath25   \\label{eq : hpt}\\ ] ] @xmath26 \\label{eq : hct}\\ ] ]    @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the time independent amplitude of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 respectively . + for the analysis of the matching of signals from different locations in the sky , it is sufficient to consider either of the polarisation states of fm signal .",
    "we consider the @xmath31 polarisation of the signal of unit amplitude .",
    "therefore , the ft for a data of @xmath32 observation time may be expressed as ( srivastava and sahay 2002b ) @xmath33e^{-i2\\pi ft}dt   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\simeq   \\frac{\\nu}{2 w_{rot } } \\sum_{k   =   -   \\infty}^{k = \\infty } \\sum_{m = - \\infty}^{m =   \\infty } e^ { i { \\cal a}}{\\cal   b } [ \\tilde{{\\cal c } } - i\\tilde{{\\cal d } } ] \\ ; ; \\ ; \\label{eq : hf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34    j stands for the bessel function of first kind . the computational strain to compute @xmath35 from equation  ( [ eq : hf ] ) can be reduced by @xmath36 by using the symmetrical property of the bessel functions , given as @xmath37\\ ; + \\nonumber \\\\ & & j_o ( { \\cal z})\\sum_{m = 1}^{m = \\infty } { j_m({\\cal n})\\over   \\nu^2 - m^2 } \\left [ ( { \\cal y } { \\cal u } -   { \\cal x } { \\cal v } ) - i (   { \\cal x } { \\cal u } + { \\cal y } { \\cal v } ) \\right]\\ ; + \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\left.\\sum_{k = 1 } ^{k = \\infty}\\sum_{m = - \\infty}^{m = \\infty } e^ { i { \\cal a}}{\\cal b}\\left ( \\tilde{{\\cal c } } - i\\tilde{{\\cal d } } \\right)\\right]\\ ; ; \\label{eq : fm_code}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath38    equation  ( [ eq : fm_code ] ) contains double infinite series of bessel function .",
    "however , we know that the value of bessel function decreases rapidly as its order exceeds the argument . from equations  ( [ eq : pq ] ) , it can be shown that the order of bessel function required to compute @xmath35 in the infinite series are @xmath39 @xmath40",
    "matched filtering is the most suitable technique for the detection of signals whose wave form is known .",
    "the wave forms are used to construct a bank of templates , which represent the expected signal wave form with all possible ranges of its parameters ( source location , ellipticity , etc . ) . in an all sky search by match filtering ,",
    "srivastava and sahay 2002c observed symmetries under the following transformations @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43    the above observations are made by studying few cases for 1-d data set .",
    "hence , it will be important to understand and check the generic nature of the matching of signals under the above transformations . to study this problem we use the formula for ff ( apostolatos 1995 ) which quantitatively describes the closeness of two signals , given as @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent respectively the fts of the actual signal wave form and the templates .",
    "the inner product of two waveform @xmath47 and @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49    where @xmath50 denotes complex conjugation , @xmath51 denotes the ft of the quantity underneath @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the spectral density of the detector noise . in our analysis",
    "we assume the noise to be stationary and gaussian .",
    "it is remarked that to compute the inner product of the signals one would require the bw of the doppler modulated signal . from the doppler shift ( srivastava and sahay 2002a ) ,",
    "the bw of doppler modulated signal may be given as @xmath54      let us consider that geo600 detector ( the position and orientation of the detectors can be found in jaranowski et al .",
    "1998 ) receive a cgw signal of frequency @xmath55 hz ( unreasonably low frequency has been chosen for illustrative purposes limited by available computational power ) from a source located at @xmath56 . in order to evaluate the matching of the signals in colatitude , we first maximize ff over @xmath21 by choosing @xmath57 .",
    "now , we wish to check the symmetries in colatitude represented by equation  ( [ eq : sym_theta ] ) for the data set @xmath58 d. for the purpose we maximize the ff over @xmath20 by varying @xmath59 in discrete steps over entire range i.e. @xmath60 to @xmath61 . for the present case it is sufficient to take the ranges of @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath64 to @xmath65 and @xmath66 to @xmath67 respectively and @xmath68 .",
    "the results so obtained are shown in figure  ( [ fig : theta_var ] ) . to establish the observed symmetries ,",
    "we similarly compute the ff for @xmath69 d and observe that the matching of signals remains almost same . however ,",
    "due to obliquity of the ecliptic , the variation in the matching of signals will depend on source frequency , colatitude and detector position and orientation .",
    "we check the dependence of the ff on this parameters .",
    "the result so obtained for different earth based laser interferometric detectors are shown in the tables  ( [ table : theta_var_ff ] ) , &  ( [ table : coeff_theta ] ) and figures  ( [ fig : freq_beta0 ] ) &  ( [ fig : freq_beta90 ] ) .",
