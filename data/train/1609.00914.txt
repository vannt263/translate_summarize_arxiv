    "there are at least two different perspectives from which our subject can be viewed .",
    "we survey some recent developments in the emerging field of _ high - dimensional combinatorics_. however , these results can be viewed as well as part of an ongoing effort to apply _ the probabilistic method in topology_. the systematic study of random graphs was started by erds and rnyi in the early 1960 s and had a major impact on discrete mathematics , computer science and engineering . since graphs are one - dimensional simplicial complexes , why not develop an analogous theory of @xmath2-dimensional random simplicial complexes for all @xmath3 ? to this end ,",
    "an analog of erds and rnyi s @xmath0 model , called @xmath4 , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "such a simplicial complex @xmath5 is @xmath2-dimensional , it has @xmath6 vertices and has a full @xmath7-dimensional skeleton .",
    "each @xmath2-face is placed in @xmath5 independently with probability @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath9 is identical with @xmath0 .",
    "one of the most natural questions to ask in any model of random graphs concerns graph _ connectivity_. as erds and rnyi famously showed , the threshold for graph connectivity in @xmath0 is @xmath10 . to draw the analogy from a topological perspective",
    ", one should seek the threshold for the vanishing of the @xmath7-st homology .",
    "this indeed was the motivating problem in  @xcite .",
    "as that paper showed , and together with subsequent work  @xcite this threshold in @xmath4 is @xmath11 . here",
    "the coefficients can come from any fixed finite abelian group .",
    "the same question for _ integral _",
    "@xmath7-st homology has attracted considerable attention and the answer is believed to be the same .",
    "this was recently confirmed for @xmath12  @xcite , and is not yet fully resolved for higher dimensions ( but see  @xcite ) .",
    "the threshold for the vanishing of the fundamental group of @xmath13 is fairly well ( but still not perfectly ) understood  @xcite .",
    "since we tend to work by analogy with the @xmath0 theory , it is a very challenging problem to seek a high - dimensional counterpart to the _ phase transition _ that occurs at @xmath1 .",
    "it is here that the random graph asymptotically - almost - surely ( a.a.s . )",
    "acquires cycles .",
    "namely , for every @xmath14 there is a @xmath15 such that a graph in @xmath16 is a forest with probability @xmath17 , but for @xmath18 , a @xmath0 graph has , a.a.s .",
    ", at least one cycle .",
    "these notions have natural analogs in higher - dimensional complexes that suggest what is being sought .",
    "however , even more famously , a _ giant",
    "_ connected component with @xmath19 vertices emerges at @xmath1 .",
    "since there is no natural notion of connected components at dimensions @xmath20 , it is not even clear what to ask .",
    "finding the correct framework for asking this question and discovering the answer is indeed one of the main accomplishments of the research that we survey here .",
    "another reason that makes the high - dimensional scenario more complicated than the graph - theoretic picture is that there are several natural analogs for acyclicity .",
    "a @xmath7-face @xmath21 in a @xmath2-complex @xmath5 is _ free _ if it is contained in exactly one @xmath2-dimensional face @xmath22 of @xmath5 . in the corresponding _ elementary collapse _",
    "step , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are removed from @xmath5 .",
    "we say that @xmath5 is _",
    "@xmath2-collapsible _ if it is possible to eliminate all its @xmath2-faces by a series of elementary collapses .",
    "otherwise , the maximal subcomplex of @xmath5 in which all @xmath7-faces are contained in at least @xmath23 @xmath2-faces is called the _ core _ of @xmath5 .",
    "clearly a graph ( i.e. , a @xmath24-dimensional complex ) is @xmath24-collapsible if and only if it is acyclic , i.e. , a forest .",
    "a @xmath2-complex @xmath5 is said to be _",
    "@xmath2-acyclic _ if its @xmath2-th homology group vanishes .",
    "namely , if the @xmath2-dimensional boundary matrix @xmath25 has a trivial right kernel . unless otherwise stated , we consider this matrix over the reals .",
    "the real @xmath2-betti number of @xmath5 is @xmath26 .    whereas acyclicity and @xmath24-collapsibility are equivalent for graphs , this is no longer the case for @xmath2-dimensional complexes - dimensional complexes as a @xmath2-complex ]",
    "clearly , a @xmath2-collapsible simplicial complex has a trivial @xmath2-th homology , but the reverse implication does not hold in dimension @xmath27 .    in this view",
    ", there are now two potentially separate thresholds to determine in @xmath4 : for @xmath2-collapsibility and for the vanishing of the @xmath2-th homology .",
    "these questions were answered and the respective thresholds were determined in a series of four papers . a lower bound on the threshold for @xmath2-collapsibility was found in  @xcite and a matching upper bound",
    "was proved in  @xcite .",
    "an upper bound on the threshold for the vanishing of the @xmath2-th homology was found in  @xcite , with a recent matching lower bound for real homology  @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that the same bound holds for all coefficient rings , but this remains open at present .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to survey these results and present the main ingredients of the proofs . in particular , we highlight the key role of the local structure of random complexes in all these proofs .",
    "both thresholds are of the form @xmath28 .",
    "namely there is a constant @xmath29 corresponding to the @xmath2-collapsibility threshold and @xmath30 for acyclicity . as functions of the dimension @xmath2 ,",
    "the constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 differ substantially .",
    "our results allow us to numerically compute them to desirable accuracy ( see table [ tbl : thrvals ] ) .",
    ".the critical constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     before stating the theorems , a small technical remark is in order . an obvious obstacle for a @xmath2-complex @xmath5 to be either @xmath2-collapsible or @xmath2-acyclic is that it contains the boundary of a @xmath33-simplex @xmath34 , i.e. all the @xmath35 @xmath2-faces that are spanned by some @xmath35 vertices . in the random complex @xmath36 , these objects appear with probability bounded away from both zero and one , and it is easy to see that their number is poisson distributed with a constant expectation . in particular , @xmath36 is @xmath34-free with positive probability .",
    "there are several ways to go around this technical difficulty . in @xcite a model of random complexes conditioned on being @xmath34-free",
    "was considered , which allowed a cleaner form for the theorems .",
    "here we work with the simple binomial model , and consequently must mention these simplices .",
    "we turn to the main theorems .",
    "let @xmath27 be an integer , @xmath37 real and denote the core of @xmath38 by @xmath39 .",
    "we define @xmath31 as the minimum of the function @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , we let @xmath41 be the unique root in @xmath42 of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , for an integer @xmath45 and @xmath46 real , we let @xmath47 $ ] , and @xmath48 be the smallest positive root of @xmath49 , or equivalently @xmath50 .",

    "@xmath5 is not @xmath2-collapsible .",

    "here @xmath62 are the face numbers of @xmath39 and @xmath63 is the second betti number .",
    "the functions are normalized by @xmath64 , and @xmath65.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    it is not hard to determine the asymptotic behaviour ( in @xmath2 ) of these expressions , namely , @xmath66 and @xmath67 consequently , there is a wide range of the parameter @xmath68 for which almost all the complexes in @xmath4 are acyclic and non - collapsible . there are strong indications that complexes from this range have interesting and unexpected properties .",
    "note that @xmath69 implies that @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , this difference of the face numbers is a lower bound for the @xmath2-th betti number .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] shows that for all @xmath71 , and up to the appearance of @xmath34 s these two conditions are typically equivalent and the lower bound is asymptotically tight .",
    "this is clearly a probabilistic statement which does not hold in general .",
    "we turn to deal with the emergence of the giant component , a subject on which there exists an extensive body of literature .",
    "as mentioned above , there is no obvious high - dimensional counterpart to the notion of connected components , and we need a conceptual idea in order to even get started .",
    "the notion of _ shadows _ , introduced in @xcite , offers a way around this difficulty .",
    "the idea is to tie connected components with cycles , which do have natural high dimensional counterparts .",
    "the shadow of a graph @xmath72 is the set of those edges that are not in @xmath72 , whose addition to @xmath72 creates a new cycle .",
    "it turns out that the giant component emerges exactly when the shadow of the evolving random graph acquires positive density .",
    "in particular , for @xmath73 the shadow of @xmath16 has density @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the unique root in @xmath42 of @xmath76 ( see figure [ fig : shadowgraph ] ) .",
    "this suggests how we should define @xmath77 , the shadow of @xmath5 , a @xmath2-dimensional complex with full @xmath7-skeleton .",
    "namely , it is the following set of @xmath2-faces : @xmath78 in words , a @xmath2-face belongs to @xmath77 if it is not in @xmath5 and its addition to @xmath5 creates a new @xmath2-cycle .",
    "we are considering throughout the vanishing of the @xmath2-th homology and @xmath2-collapsibility .",
    "these two notions capture acyclicity from an algebraic resp .",
    "combinatorial perspective . for @xmath79",
    "the two coincide , but they differ widely for @xmath27 .",
    "this dual perspective carries over to two notions of shadows .",
    "a @xmath2-face @xmath22 that does not belong to a @xmath2-complex @xmath5 is in @xmath5 s @xmath80-shadow if its addition to @xmath5 increases the @xmath2-homology .",
    "it is in the _ c - shadow _ of @xmath5 if its addition to @xmath5 increases the core .",
    "again , these notions coincide for @xmath79 , and the @xmath80-shadow is always contained in the c - shadow , but for @xmath27 they may differ .",
    "the notion of shadows lets us compare the phase transitions of random graphs and random complexes of higher dimensions , and a substantial qualitative difference reveals itself . while the density of the shadow of @xmath0 undergoes a smooth transition around @xmath81 , when @xmath82 both the c - shadow and the @xmath80-shadow of @xmath36 undergo _ discontinuous _ first - order phase transitions at the critical points @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",

    "initially , this seemed as merely a useful tool in studying the threshold for @xmath2-collapsibility , and in establishing an upper bound on the threshold of the vanishing of the @xmath2-th homology .",
    "however , in obtaining a lower bound on this threshold , it became apparent that this idea should be viewed in the wider context of _ local weak limits_. this framework was introduced by benjamini and schramm @xcite and aldous and steele @xcite . in recent years , this approach was used in deriving new asymptotic results in various fields of mathematics ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the study of @xmath2-collapsibility in random complexes was significantly influenced by work on @xmath45-cores in random hypergraphs and specifically the works by molloy @xcite and riordan @xcite .",
