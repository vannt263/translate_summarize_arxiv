    "calculations in qcd can be performed numerically on a discrete space - time lattice , provided the lattice spacing is small enough to accommodate all of the revelant physical distance scales . in the presence of a heavy quark",
    "the lattice spacing must be small relative to the inverse quark mass , resulting in large computational requirements , unless an appropriate `` effective theory '' is used .",
    "in particular , for the case of a hadron containing exactly one heavy quark , the dynamics can be expanded in powers of the inverse heavy quark mass using the well - established technique of heavy quark effective theory@xcite or nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd)@xcite . with the heavy quark expansion , the lattice spacing can be much coarser and the computational requirements are correspondingly smaller .    in the present work , two issues will be addressed within quenched lattice nrqcd .",
    "firstly , is the charm quark sufficiently heavy to permit the use of lattice nrqcd for charmed meson spectroscopy ?",
    "secondly , what are the mass splittings ( magnitude and sign ) between p - wave mesons containing a single heavy quark ?",
    "the first issue is clearly of interest due to the computational efficiency of lattice nrqcd .",
    "the heavy quark expansion is known to work well for bottom mesons@xcite , but previous research has demonstrated that @xmath2 and @xmath3 contributions can be comparable in magnitude for the s - wave spin splitting of charmed mesons.@xcite the present work provides an extension of this investigation by considering new simulations that incorporate a number of changes in method .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite used the fourth root of an elementary plaquette to define the tadpole improvement factor , @xmath4 , whereas the present work uses the mean link in landau gauge .",
    "since the landau definition is advantageous in other contexts@xcite , including the velocity expansion for the charmonium spectrum of lattice nrqcd@xcite , it might be expected to improve the convergence of the heavy quark expansion for the charmed heavy - light spectrum as well .",
    "also , the light quark was described by the sheikholeslami - wohlert action in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the present work uses a d234 action@xcite which has smaller lattice spacing errors classically .",
    "the simulations in the present work differ from those of ref .",
    "@xcite in various other ways as well , including dirichlet versus periodic boundary conditions for light quark propagation , differing discretizations for heavy quark propagation , and the introduction of an anisotropic lattice with a smaller temporal lattice spacing than spatial spacing . despite these modifications ,",
    "the present simulations produce a conclusion similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite : the @xmath2 and @xmath3 contributions are comparable in magnitude for the s - wave charmed spin splitting ; in the present work , each is roughly 20% of the @xmath5 result for @xmath0 , though the @xmath3 contribution is closer to 10% for @xmath1 .",
    "the second issue under discussion relates to the spectrum of p - wave mesons containing a single heavy quark .",
    "the relative orderings of the p - wave bottom mesons have only recently come under direct experimental scrutiny@xcite , and the complete picture is not yet clear .",
    "meanwhile theoretical predictions differ from one another even at a qualitative level .",
    "the traditional expectation of a hydrogen - like spectrum that arises from a number of model calculations@xcite has been questioned long ago by schnitzer@xcite and very recently by isgur@xcite and by ebert , galkin and faustov@xcite .",
    "the calculation is difficult within lattice qcd because the p - wave splittings are not large in comparison to the typical scale of nonperturbative qcd , and because of operator mixing for the pair of p - wave states having @xmath6 .",
    "some previous attempts have been made@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties are often substantial , and results are not always as consistent with one another as might have been hoped .",
    "the present work represents a further comment on this situation .",
    "in particular , the @xmath7 mass splitting is found to be positive as in the traditional hydrogen - like ordering , and to be substantially less than 100 mev , while the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 splittings are even smaller .",
    "these splittings are consistent with a number of model calculations , but are somewhat smaller than the lattice nrqcd calculation of ref .",
    "the lattice action has three terms : gauge action , light quark action and heavy quark action .",
    "the entire action is classically and tadpole - improved with the tadpole factors , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , defined as the mean links in landau gauge in a spatial and temporal direction , respectively .",

    "plaquettes in the temporal - spatial planes are denoted by `` pt '' , while rectangles with the long side in a spatial(temporal ) direction are labeled by `` rst''(``rts '' ) .",
    "the leading classical errors of this action are quartic in lattice spacing .    for light quarks ,",
    "a d234 action@xcite is used with parameters set to their tadpole - improved classical values .",
    "its leading classical errors are cubic in lattice spacing .",
