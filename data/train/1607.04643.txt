    "the on going search for new physics ( np ) is mostly inspired by the shortcomings of the sm in addressing some of the fundamental questions in modern particle physics , such as the hierarchy problem , the flavor patterns in the fermionic sector and dark matter . some of these unresolved issues may be closely related and may have tev - scale origins , thus inspiring the search for tev - scale np , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "indeed , two seemingly unrelated interesting measurements of both the atlas @xcite and the cms @xcite collaborations at cern , have been recently reported :    1 .",
    "a possible @xmath23 ( local ) excess in the diphoton invariant mass distribution around 750 gev , corresponding to a signal cross - section roughly in the range @xmath24 fb @xmath25 , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this excess signal has a slight preference to a spin 0 resonance , produced via gluon - fusion and having a total width ranging from sub - gev to 45 gev , with a more significant signal obtained in the atlas analysis for a scalar with a total width @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "2 .   a possible @xmath27 excess in the measurement of the lfv decay @xmath22 of the 125 gev light higgs . in particular , the cms collaboration finds @xmath28 @xcite , while the atlas collaboration finds @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "whether or not these two measurements are confirmed , it emphasizes the importance of the current efforts in the search for np , since it provides an interesting manifestation / example of the exciting possibility that the building blocks of new tev - scale physics may have rather non - conventional properties , potentially with important repercussions for both flavor and the hierarchy problems .",
    "for example , the new heavy scalar particle , @xmath30 , responsible for the 750 gev @xmath8 excess , should have a rather narrow width and suppressed decay rates into  conventional \" channels such as @xmath31 , for which no excess signals has been observed within the currently available sensitivity of the corresponding lhc searches .",
    "in addition , such a heavy scalar @xmath30 is most likely related to the light 125 gev scalar state and , therefore , might also be involved in flavor changing ( fc ) transitions in the fermionic sector .",
    "such properties of the would be new 750 gev resonating particle are , therefore , very challenging to accommodate in models beyond the sm , in particular , in supersymmetric models or in models that involve extra space - time dimensions , which seem to have a more fundamental origin and , therefore , likely linked to physics at higher energy scales .",
    "nonetheless , we will show in this paper that a certain class of low - energy effective 2hdm frameworks with a 4th generation of heavy chiral fermions may be interesting candidates for such  exotic \" tev - scale np .",
    "in particular , since no evidence for such fundamentally structured theories has yet been seen , a frequently adopted phenomenological approach in studies of np , is to construct tev - scale models which require a uv completion and may , thus , be viewed as low energy effective frameworks for the underlying dynamics .",
    "such models are useful as a guide for the exploration and model building of more fundamental theories and they often include new heavy fermionic and scalar states with sub - tev masses .",
    "one of the simplest variants of an effective low - energy np candidate , which dates back to the 1980 s @xcite , is the sm with an additional 4th generation of fermions ; the so called sm4 ( for useful reviews see e.g. , @xcite ) . indeed , since three generations of chiral fermions have been observed in nature , it is natural to ask why not four generations of chiral fermions ?",
    "it is quite interesting that this simple extension of the sm may address some of the theoretical challenges in particle physics , such as : electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the hierarchy problem @xcite , the cp - violation and the strength of the first - order phase transition needed to explain the origin of matter - anti matter asymmetry in the universe @xcite , and flavor physics @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the sm4 ( i.e. , with four generations of fermions and one higgs doublet ) is now excluded , since it can not accommodate the measured sm - like properties of the 125 gev scalar , see e.g. , @xcite , primarily due to an @xmath32 enhancement in the gluon - fusion light higgs production mechanism from diagrams with @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the loops @xcite ; see , however , w .- s .",
    "hou in @xcite .",
    "this fact , along with the rather stringent direct limits on the masses of such heavy quarks ( to be discussed later ) , has led to a common belief that generic extensions to the sm with heavy chiral 4th generation fermions @xmath35 are excluded . however , as was suggested by us a few years ago @xcite and will be demonstrated again here , this is not the case when the heavy 4th generation chiral sector is embedded in frameworks with an extended higgs sector ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , an extended higgs sector in the context of 4th generation heavy fermions may come in handy for further addressing flavor problems @xcite and the strength of the ew phase transition required for baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will consider in this paper a version of a 2hdm introduced by us in @xcite - the so called 4g2hdm of type i , where a chiral 4th generation doublet of heavy fermions ( quark and lepton ) is added and is coupled _ only _ to one of the scalar doublets ( the  heavy \" doublet ) , while the sm 1st-3rd generations fermions are coupled only to the other doublet ( the  light \" doublet ) .",
    "we will show in this paper that this 4g2hdm is a well motivated and valid low - energy model , which is compatible with the 125 gev signals ( see also @xcite ) , with pewd and with the existing direct bounds on the heavy fermions , and at the same time can also accommodate the recent indications for a new 750 gev scalar resonance in the @xmath8 channel .    as was shown in @xcite , the price to pay when adding another heavy sm - like chiral fermion doublet is that such constructions posses a nearby threshold / cutoff at the several tev scale , which is manifest ( as landau poles ) in the evolution of the yukawa and higgs potential couplings @xcite .",
    "indeed , the large yukawa couplings of the heavy chiral fermions can be thought of as a reflection of an underlying tev - scale strong dynamics , so that the 4g2hdm framework should be viewed as a low energy ( i.e. , sub - tev ) effective model of an underlying strongly interacting sector .",
    "in particular , if the new heavy chiral fermions are viewed as the agents of ewsb ( and are , therefore , linked to strong dynamics at the nearby tev - scale , see e.g. , @xcite ) , then more higgs particles , which may be composites of these 4th generation fermions , are expected at the sub - tev regime.@xmath36}$ ] in such scenarios the resulting low - energy effective theory may contain more than a single composite higgs field @xcite and may thus resemble a two ( or more ) higgs doublet framework ( for other related studies of the phenomenology of multi - higgs 4th generation models see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to revisit the 4g2hdm of @xcite , studying its compatibility with the updated measurements of the 125 gev light higgs signals and with pewd .",
    "we will also confront our model with the 750 gev @xmath8 excess and study its compatibility with a sub - percent branching ratio of the light higgs in the fc decay channel @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , many interesting and exotic constructions beyond the sm have been suggested as possible explanations of the 750 gev @xmath8 excess ( too many to be cited here ) ; in most cases involving new degrees of freedom beyond just the 750 gev resonating particle .",
    "in particular , the relevance of 2hdm frameworks to the 750 gev @xmath8 excess has been intensively studied in the past several months , where it was shown that the simplest 2hdm extension to the sm , in which no additional heavy degrees of freedom are added ( i.e. , beyond the extended scalar sector ) , can not accommodate the necessary enhancement in @xmath37 , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "consequently , extended 2hdm models with tev scale vector - like ( vl ) fermions have been suggested for addressing the 750 gev resonance signal @xcite .",
    "the upshot of these studies is that , the needed enhancement in the 1-loop production and decay channels @xmath38 and @xmath39 , requires several copies of vl fermions and/or vl fermions with charges appreciably larger than those of the sm fermions , unless their yukawa couplings are much larger than one .",
    "the 4g2hdm considered in this work is , therefore , conceptually simpler , relying on new heavy fermionic degrees of freedom with properties similar to the sm fermions in a model that already exists in the literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the type i 4g2hdm and we layout the physical parameters that are used in the numerical analysis . in section 3 we show our results and in section 4 we discuss their phenomenological consequences .",
    "in section 5 we discuss our results and summarize .",
    "motivated by the idea that tev - scale scalar degrees of freedom may emerge as composites associated with heavy fermions , we assume that the low - energy ( sub - tev ) effective framework is parameterized by a 2hdm with a chiral sm - like 4th generation of heavy fermions . specifically , the model is constructed following @xcite , such that one of the higgs fields ( @xmath40 - the  heavier \" field ) couples only to the new heavy 4th generation fermionic fields , while the second higgs field ( @xmath41 - the  lighter \" field ) is responsible for the mass generation of all other ( lighter ) fermions ( i.e. , the 1st-3rd generation sm fermions ) . in this model ,",
    "named in @xcite the 4g2hdm of type",
    "i ( here we will refer to it simply as the 4g2hdm ) , the yukawa interaction lagrangian can be realized in terms of a @xmath0-symmetry under which the fields transform as follows : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the su(2 ) fermion ( quark or lepton ) doublets and singlets , respectively , and @xmath45 are the two higgs doublets @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the yukawa potential that respects the above @xmath0-symmetry is : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the up and down - type su(2 ) fermion singlets ( quark or lepton of all four generations ) , @xmath51 is the identity matrix and @xmath52 is the diagonal @xmath53 matrix @xmath54 .",
    "the scalar sector contains five massive states : a charged scalar @xmath55 , a cp - odd state @xmath56 and two cp - even scalars @xmath5 , so that @xmath1 is the lighter one , corresponding to the observed 125 gev higgs boson .",
    "these physical states are related to the components of the two su(2 ) scalar doublets via : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the higgs mixing angle in the cp - even sector and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the ratio between the vev s of the heavy and light higgs fields .",

    "also , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are new mixing matrices where all fcnc effects of the 4g2hdm are encoded .",
    "they are obtained after diagonalizing the quark mass matrices and , therefore , depend on the rotation ( unitary ) matrices of the right - handed down and up - quarks @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . in particular , for @xmath54 in eq .",

    "[ eq : ly4g]-[sigma ] is assumed to be copied to the leptonic sector , see @xcite . in the following sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , for illustrative purposes ( and without loss of generality )",
    ", we will set @xmath77 in both the quark and lepton sectors , so that fcnc effects ( in particular , between the 4th generation fermions and the sm fermions ) are  turned off \" .",
    "in fact , from the phenomenological point of view , it is sufficient to assume that @xmath78 ( i.e. , forbidding the decay @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 , thus forbidding the decays @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) in order to accommodate relatively light @xmath33 and @xmath34 with masses as low as 350 gev , since the existing stringent exclusion limits of @xmath86 gev , are based on searches that assume 100% branching ratios of the 4th generation quarks into one of the channels : @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "we will , therefore , assume that the dominant @xmath33 and @xmath34 decays are into one of the fc channels @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 and @xmath84 ) , due to small fcnc entries in @xmath92 ( which have no effect on the results presented in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] ) , in which case small off - diagonal ckm entries @xmath93 and/or @xmath94 are also allowed as long as @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "such flavor structures , may have interesting phenomenological implications , as will be discussed in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the 2hdm scalar sector is parameterized by seven free parameters ( after minimization of the potential ) , which , in the so called  physical basis \" , can be chosen as the four physical higgs masses ( @xmath96 ) , the two angles @xmath97 and @xmath59 and one parameter from the scalar potential , which is needed in order to specify the scalar couplings , in particular , @xmath98 ( which enters in the 1-loop @xmath99 decay ) , @xmath100 ( which enters the 1-loop @xmath101 decay ) and @xmath102 ( required for the decay @xmath103 ) . in the physical basis , these scalar couplings can be written at tree - level as ( see e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath104 \\label{lam1 } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath105 \\label{lam2 }   ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath106 \\label{lam3 }   ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is a mass - like term , @xmath108 , which softly breaks the above @xmath0-symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) , and which can be used to specify the above tree - level scalar couplings .    however , since the working assumption of the 4g2hdm is that the scalar sector may be strongly interacting at the near by few tev scale , the scalar potential is expected to be subject to significant renormalization and threshold effects .",
    "thus , the above scalar couplings are expected to deviate from their tree - level values , depending on the details of the uv completion and on the masses of the heavy degrees of freedom of this model , see e.g. , @xcite . as an example , consider the 1-loop corrections to the @xmath102 coupling @xmath110 , for @xmath111 , in which case there is no mixing between the light and heavy higgs fields ( see eq .",
    "[ higgsangles ] ) , as required in order to accommodate the 750 gev @xmath8 excess in the 4g2hdm ( see section [ sec4 ] ) . in this limit , the yukawa couplings of the 4th generation fermions to the light higgs state @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) vanish ( see eq .  [ sff1 ] and table [ tab4 ] ) and",
    "we find that the dominant effect arises from the 1-loop triangle diagram with the charged higgs exchange in the loop , giving a  renormalized \" @xmath102 coupling @xmath113 , with : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the charged higgs triangle loop integral , given by : @xmath116 in particular , one roughly finds @xmath117 when @xmath118 and with @xmath119 gev , @xmath120 gev and @xmath121 .",
    "for example , @xmath122 for @xmath123 gev and @xmath124 tev . in what follows we will",

    "note that while @xmath143 and @xmath144 are ratios of tree - level couplings , @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the normalized ( with respect to the sm ) 1-loop 4g2hdm couplings @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively , calculated using the formula in @xcite . also , in our 4g2hdm @xmath149 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in particular , if @xmath150 , then @xmath151 is open and typically dominates , having a branching ratio of @xmath152 ( see table [ tab4 ] ) . in that case",
    ", we find that within the 4g2hdm parameter space discussed here , the corresponding resonance cross - sections for @xmath13 production at the 13 tev lhc are typically @xmath153 [ pb ] and @xmath154 [ pb ] , ( both @xmath3 and @xmath56 produced through gluon - fusion @xmath155 ) , so that in the case of @xmath156 ( see table [ tab4 ] ) , this is about an order of magnitude larger than the qcd ( continuum ) @xmath13 production rate .",
    "therefore , if the 750 gev @xmath8 resonance persists , one should also expect an observable resonance signal at least in the @xmath157 channel .",
    "let us , therefore , briefly investigate the signal @xmath157 under more general grounds , i.e. , when @xmath158 but not necessarily @xmath159 gev .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath160 , the @xmath33 will further decay either via the fc channels @xmath14 ( @xmath161 or @xmath162 ) or via the 3-body decay @xmath163 ( @xmath17 ) , where @xmath164 are either off - shell or on - shell ( i.e. , when @xmath165 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if the former case ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) dominates , then the resulting resonance signal should be searched for in @xmath166 ( @xmath19 is a light jet ) , while if the 3-body @xmath33 decay dominates then @xmath167 . in either case , the sm - like light higgs ( @xmath1 ) further decays into @xmath168 or @xmath169 with sm rates , giving rise to resonance signatures of the form @xmath170 , with @xmath171 and with unique kinematic features that distinguishes them from more conventional signatures .",
    "similar signals are also expected for @xmath172 .",
    "we recognize that these type of signals are very challenging and may require new strategies , in particular , for reconstructing the parent @xmath9 s in such a high jet - multiplicity environment .",
    "the decay pattern of the charged higgs may also change in the 4g2hdm , in particular for the case when @xmath173 , for which the decay of @xmath55 into a pair of heavy 4th generation fermions can dominate ( see bmp1 in table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "in particular , taking @xmath174 and assuming that @xmath55 is sufficiently heavier than @xmath175 , so that we can ignore corrections of @xmath176 in the phase - space factors , we have in the 4g2hdm : @xmath177    thus , for @xmath178 , @xmath179 ( i.e. , @xmath180 ) , @xmath181 gev ( i.e. , values of the 4g2hdm parameter space that can accommodate the 750 gev @xmath8 signal ) and taking @xmath182 tev , we obtain : @xmath183 and @xmath184 , in which case @xmath185 ( e.g. , as in the case of bmp2 ) , leading to some interesting signatures of the heavy charged higgs at the lhc .",
    "in particular , the dominant production channels of @xmath55 at the lhc are @xmath186 , with a typical cross - section of @xmath187 fb when @xmath188 @xcite . the subsequent @xmath55 decay to a pair of 4th generation heavy fermions with @xmath189",
    "will , thus , lead to new @xmath55 signals , e.g. , @xmath190 , again with the typical 4g2hdm heavy fermion high jet - multiplicity signatures of the form @xmath191 .",
    "this is in contrast to  standard \" 2hdm frameworks where the heavy charged higgs will dominantly decay to @xmath192 and/or @xmath193 ( see bmp1 and bmp3 ) , leading to a lower multiplicity of jets in the final state .",
    "as noted earlier , a wider range of solutions exist ( which are not being discussed here ) to all data and filters mentioned above ( i.e. , including the 750 gev @xmath8 resonance ) , in which lighter pseudoscalar @xmath56 and charged higgs @xmath194 are allowed , with masses as low as @xmath195 gev . in such 4g2hdm scenarios , the heavy 4th generation quarks ( and leptons ) can have substantial decay rates in channels involving also the heavy higgs species , i.e. , @xmath196 ( @xmath17 and @xmath197 and @xmath198 ( @xmath17 and @xmath197 , followed by @xmath199 and @xmath200 . indeed , such decay patterns can also lead to some un - explored collider signatures of the 4g2hdm .",
    "we leave the discussion of the phenomenology of such wider range of 4g2hdm scenarios to a later work .",
    "finally , we wish to comment on the flavor violating structure of the 4g2hdm and its compatibility with the recently reported indications of the lfv decay of the 125 gev light higgs @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "we have revisited a class of models beyond the sm , suggested by us a few years ago in @xcite , which put together an additional higgs doublet with a heavy chiral 4th generation quark and lepton doublet and which have several important and attractive theoretical features . in particular , we focused on the so - called 4g2hdm of type i ( in @xcite ) , in which a discrete @xmath0 symmetry couples the  heavy \" scalar doublet only to the heavy 4th generation fermions and the  light \" one to the lighter sm fermions .",

    "<S> we revisit models where a heavy chiral 4th generation doublet of fermions is embedded in a class of two higgs doublets models ( 2hdm ) with a discrete @xmath0 symmetry , which couples the  heavy \" scalar doublet only to the 4th generation fermions and the  light \" one to the standard model ( sm ) fermions - the so - called 4g2hdm introduced by us several years ago . </S>",
    "<S> we study the constraints imposed on the 4g2hdm from direct searches of heavy fermions , from precision electroweak data ( pewd ) and from the measured production and decay signals of the 125 gev scalar , which in the 4g2hdm corresponds to the lightest cp - even scalar @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the recently reported excess in the @xmath2 spectrum around 750 gev can be accommodated by the heavy cp - even scalar of the 4g2hdm , @xmath3 , resulting in a unique choice of parameter space : negligible mixing ( @xmath4 ) between the two cp - even scalars @xmath5 and heavy 4th generation quark and lepton masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . whether or not the 750 gev @xmath8 resonance is confirmed , interesting phenomenology emerges in @xmath9 - higgs systems ( @xmath10 ) , that can be searched for at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the heavy scalar states of the model , @xmath11 , may have @xmath12 , giving rise to observable @xmath13 signals on resonance , followed by the flavor changing @xmath9 decays @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and/or @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to rather distinct signatures , with or without charged leptons , of the form @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 being light and b - quark jets , respectively ) , with @xmath21 and unique kinematic features . </S>",
    "<S> these high jet - multiplicity signals appear to be very challenging and may need new search strategies for detection of such heavy chiral quarks . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the flavor structure of the 4g2hdm can easily accommodate the interesting recent indications of a percent - level branching ratio in the lepton - flavor - violating ( lfv ) decay @xmath22 of the 125 gev higgs , if it is experimentally confirmed .    </S>",
