    "the discovery that the bh mass ( @xmath3 ) correlates with certain host galaxy properties has made obtaining accurate masses for these objects a high priority in extragalactic studies .",
    "kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) and magorrian et al . (",

    "( 2002 ) find that the correlation can be written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 for a reference dispersion of @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath4 is measured outside the radius of influence of the bh , defined to be @xmath9 , the @xmath3 - @xmath4 correlation demonstrates a fundamental relationship between the bh and its host spheroid .",
    "such a correlation has important implications for theories of bh and galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is thus important to confirm and strengthen the correlation by providing highly accurate bh masses for a large number of galaxies .",

    "the kinematic data must be resolved inside the region where keplerian motion dominates , however , to ensure that those stars fully contribute to the line of sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) , and not just in its tails .",

    "other than the milky way , m31 is the only nearby galaxy in the local group with a resolved @xmath15 at the resolution of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ; @xmath19 ) ; m33 is consistent with having a maximum bh mass of @xmath20 ( merritt et al .",

    "m31 offers a unique opportunity to obtain a secure bh mass from spatially resolved stellar kinematics inside @xmath15 .",
    "m31 is also the nearest galaxy with a normal bulge ( kormendy 1993 ) , and it has a nucleus ; that is , a small - scale stellar component which is photometrically and dynamically distinct from the bulge and the large - scale galactic disk ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , and references therein ) .",

    "we refer the reader forward to figures in section [ s.bestfits ] to see foc , stis , sis and oasis kinematic profiles .",
    "two hypotheses have been explored to account for the photometric and kinematic asymmetries observed in m31 s nucleus : first , that p1 represents a captured star cluster orbiting around a stellar disk and central bh ( emsellem & combes 1997 ) ; second , that p1 is produced by orbit crowding at apoapsis in an eccentric disk of stars on apse - aligned kepler orbits about a bh at p2 ( tremaine 1995 , hereafter t95 ) .",
    "of the two hypotheses , the evidence strongly points toward the second as correct .",
    "the eccentric disk picture naturally explains the nearly uniform colors of the nucleus , since p1 and p2 are the same stellar population .",
    "it is difficult to explain the colors with the orbiting cluster picture , since the colors of p1 are unlike any globular cluster or dwarf elliptical .",
    "a further strike against the cluster picture is demonstrated in self - consistent n - body simulations by emsellem & combes ( 1997 ) ; they find that the timescale for disruption is only @xmath79 years , so it is unlikely that such a configuration would be observed .",
    "t95 s original model for an eccentric nuclear disk in m31 consists of three nested and aligned keplerian ringlets with outwardly decreasing eccentricities .",
    "random velocities are roughly accounted for by convolution with a gaussian point spread function in the plane of the sky .",
    "the model fits the photometry of l93 and is broadly consistent with the ground - based kinematics of kormendy ( 1988 ) and bacon et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . though simple",
    ", the model predicts many of the asymmetries seen in the more recent kinematic profiles from sis , foc , stis , and oasis , including the displaced rotation center , the asymmetric rotation amplitudes , the low velocity dispersion at @xmath80 on the p1 side of the nucleus , and the presence of a dispersion spike near p2 .    in its original form , the t95 model is too limited to be used to constrain the mass of the central bh in m31 .",
    "the model ignores self - gravity , which is necessary to maintain apse - alignment in the disk against differential precession ( t95 ; statler 1999 , hereafter s99 ) .",
    "also , the model does not include a realistic treatment of velocity disperison , which is needed for an accurate prediction of the dispersion profile . both of these ingredients need to be included self - consistently .",
    "hints at how such a model can be constructed were first given by sridhar & touma ( 1999 ) .",
    "they compute orbits in nearly - keplerian potentials with lopsided perturbations and find a family of periodic loop orbits elongated in the same sense as the perturbation .",
    "they suggest that the nearly elliptical periodic parents of such orbits can be used as the backbone around which an eccentric disk with self - gravity and finite dispersion can be built .",
    "s99 computes periodic loop orbits for a continuous , uniformly precessing t95-like disk model , and shows that the requirement of uniform precession has important consequences for the disk structure .",
    "he finds that the periodic orbits follow a non - monotonic radial eccentricity distribution , in which a steep negative eccentricity gradient though the densest part of the disk is followed by a reversal of the arrangement of pericenter and apocenter with respect to the bh .",
    "s99 suggests that approximate self - consistent equilibria can be constructed around such a sequence of numerically integrated closed periodic orbits , by approximating a distribution of quasi - periodic orbits about a given periodic parent with a distribution of kepler orbits dispersed in eccentricity and orientation .",
    "salow & statler ( 2001 ) use this approximation to construct radially truncated models that reproduce many of the features seen in foc kinematics and one - dimensional hst photometry within @xmath61 of the uv peak ; the models are built by iteration with a phase space distribution function ( df ) written in terms of the integrals of motion in the kepler problem ( s99 ) .",
    "they find that the backbone orbits follow an eccentricity distribution similar to that in s99 , which gives rise to distinctive multi - peaked losvds near the uv peak .",
    "several authors have constructed self - consistent eccentric disk models by other methods .",
    "jalali & rafiee ( 2001 ) construct integrable models whose potentials are of the stckel form in elliptic coordinates .",
    "they show that models with double nuclei are sustained by four general types of regular orbits ( butterflies , nucleophilic bananas , horseshoes , and aligned loops ) .",
    "their models , however , require that both p1 and p2 have density cusps , which is not seen in the data .",
    "b01 and jacobs & sellwood ( 2001 ) perform n - body simulations of lopsided ( @xmath81 ) modes in a cold disk orbiting a central bh , and are able to find models that reproduce some of the observed features of the nucleus .",
    "more importantly , they demonstrate that lopsided stellar disks can be long - lived , giving further support to the eccentric disk picture .",
    "sambhus & sridhar ( 2002 , hereafter ss02 ) construct models using a schwarzschild - type method ( schwarzschild 1979 ) with an orbit library composed of both prograde and retrograde orbits .",
    "they find that the latter are needed to better fit the kinematics and photometry near p2 ; touma ( 2002 ) argues that a small percentage of retrograde orbits is all that is needed for a keplerian disk to grow an unstable lopsided mode . both ss02 and b01",
    "find an eccentricity distribution different than that found by s99 and salow & statler ( 2001 ) .",
    "orbits follow a steep negative eccentricity gradient through the dense part of the disk , but do not switch their apoapses to the anti - p1 side of the disk afterward .",
    "peiris & tremaine ( 2003 , hereafter pt03 ) have recently shown how a t95-like model can be extended to three - dimensions .",
    "they construct models comprised of non - interacting kepler orbits in the gravitational field of the bh .",
    "they draw orbital elements from a monte - carlo scheme , and populate the disk with a parametric df ; orbits are dispersed in eccentricity , orientation , and inclination , rather than just the first two , as in salow & statler ( 2001 ) .",
    "their models are able to reproduce most of the important features in hst photometry and sis and unpublished stis ( bender et al . 2003 ) kinematics within @xmath41 of the uv peak . however , their models are missing self - gravity and gravity - induced precession in the disk .    in this paper",
    "we extend the self - gravitating , finite dispersion models of salow & statler ( 2001 ) to include a greater radial extent , in order to rigorously model the double nucleus of m31 . along with an optimization routine",

    "secondarily , we present the properties of the disk that best fits the nucleus .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : chap2 ] , we give the details of model construction .",
    "we then provide a description of the necessary assumptions and instrument specifications needed to find models that best fit data from the nucleus of m31 in section [ sec : chap3 ] . in section [ sec : chap4 ] we present results from a grid of 24 best - fit models for m31 s nucleus , including the bh mass in m31 and disk parameters and properties .",
    "section [ sec : chap5 ] discusses the connection with other work .",
    "finally , section [ sec : chap6 ] presents some brief concluding remarks .",
    "following sridhar & touma ( 1999 ) and s99 , we construct realistic models from sets of quasi - periodic orbits whose parents are closed periodic loops elongated in the same sense as the lopsided perturbation .",
    "the parent loops form the `` backbone '' of the disk , around which quasi - periodic orbits will be populated .",
    "these backbone orbits will precess and deform under the influence of the disk s self - gravity .",
    "however , if the mass of the disk is small enough the backbone orbits will be nearly kepler ellipses in the rotating frame .",
    "this fact , together with results from simple orbit integrations in lopsided potentials , is suggestive of a way to approximate distributions of quasi - periodic orbits about a given backbone orbit .",
    "explorations of the orbital structure in a nearly keplerian potential perturbed by a slowly precessing eccentric disk show that quasi - periodic orbits fill bands surrounding the backbone orbits ( statler & salow 2000 ) ; alternatively , they can be thought of as librating about the backbone orbits in eccentricity and orientation . a natural approximation is then to describe a distribution of quasi - periodic orbits about a given backbone orbit by a distribution of kepler orbits dispersed in eccentricity and orientation . we follow this approximation , taking it as a postulate .",
    "to represent a distribution of kepler orbits about a given backbone orbit we use a phase space distribution function ( df ) written in terms of integrals of motion in the unperturbed kepler potential , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the semimajor axis , @xmath84 is the eccentricity , and @xmath85 is the argument of pericenter of a kepler orbit ; i.e. , @xmath85 is the direction of the runge - lenz vector .",

    "construction begins by expressing the df in terms of position and velocity using the standard keplerian relations :    @xmath126    @xmath127    @xmath128    where @xmath129 is the energy per unit mass , @xmath130 is the unperturbed potential , and @xmath131 is the angular momentum per unit mass ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the @xmath89 and @xmath134 components of the runge - lenz vector , respectively . to avoid discontinuities in the df , we allow @xmath84 to be negative and define @xmath85 to lie between @xmath135 .",
    "the disk density @xmath136 is found by integrating the df over velocity at each grid point , and then normalizing the grid to total disk mass @xmath137 .",
    "the potential of the disk is computed using fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) and the discrete fourier convolution theorem ( see section 2.8 of binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "zero padding is used to suppress fourier images .",
    "we use a softened point - mass kernel of one grid spacing for the green function .",
    "the disk potential is added to the potential of the black hole to form the total potential .",
    "the total potential is rotated at frequency @xmath87 about the center of mass to include inertial effects from the rotating frame ; only coriolis forces are included , since centrifugal terms are of order @xmath138 .",
    "numerical integration of the equations of motion in the rotating frame is performed to find the set of closed periodic orbits that circulate in the prograde direction and precess uniformly in the total potential .",
    "orbits are initially launched perpendicularly from the @xmath89-axis , and the velocities are varied until the next @xmath89-axis crossing occurs with @xmath139 ( s99 ) .",
    "these will be the backbone orbits for the next iteration . to ensure that only nearly - keplerian orbits are found , the total period and computed semiminor axis have to be within @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively , of those values for a kepler orbit with the same semimajor axis and eccentricity .",
    "these two conditions enable separation of higher - order resonant orbits from nearly - keplerian orbits for a wide range of tested parameter values .",
    "the backbone orbits are expressed as a new function @xmath97 .",
    "this is done by noting the positions where the orbit crosses the @xmath89-axis at positive ( @xmath142 ) and negative ( @xmath143 ) values of @xmath89 . following s99 , @xmath84 and @xmath83",
    "are determined using @xmath144 and @xmath145 . in some cases",
    "this is all that must be done ; however , for large values of @xmath87 the sequence of periodic orbits truncates inside @xmath118 .",
    "when this occurs , @xmath97 is extended out to @xmath120 using a function chosen to mimic the behavior of @xmath97 for models with no truncation .",
    "details of this are given in appendix [ app_2 ] .",
    "after extending @xmath97 , the quantity @xmath117 in equation [ e.fofao ] is updated to ensure that the disk extends out to @xmath118 , since the physical length scale can change at each iteration ( see section [ s.scalezero ] ) . a new density distribution is then found and the aforementioned sequence continues .",
    "iterations continue until the fractional change in the density per iteration is less than 5% everywhere and less than 1% on average .",
    "we project two - dimensional models onto the plane of the sky . along with inclination ( @xmath146 ) ,",
    "two position angles in the plane of the sky must be specified to fully determine a disk s orientation : the position angle of the major axis of the disk ( _ pa_@xmath147 ) and the position angle of the line of nodes ( _ pa_@xmath148 ) .",
    "we refer to three coordinate systems to describe how models are projected onto the sky .",

    "the third system , @xmath154 , is oriented such that @xmath155 lies along the line of nodes and @xmath156 is in the plane of the disk . figure [ f.coords ] shows the relationship between these three coordinate systems as seen on the plane of the sky .    for computational efficiency",
    "we perform kinematical modeling using velocity moments , rather than the full losvd .",
    "we do , however , find losvds for minimized models at specific locations , as described below in section [ s.losvds ] .    moments of the losvd are found on a @xmath90 grid with spacing @xmath157 in the @xmath149 system .",
    "the zeroth moment , @xmath158 , is found by projecting the density distribution onto the sky directly .",
    "the first and second moments , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , are found using the df for the converged model .",

    "( equations [ e.kra ] , [ e.kre ] , and [ e.krg ] ) are used to get the distribution of velocities @xmath161 on a @xmath162 velocity grid with spacing @xmath163 in units where @xmath92 and @xmath113 .",
    "the distribution @xmath161 is then transformed to the @xmath154 coordinate system to obtain the distribution @xmath164 on a similar velocity grid .",
    "this distribution is transformed to an inertial frame to include the @xmath165 contribution to the velocity , and integrated over @xmath166 to give @xmath167 , the unprojected disk - plane losvd .",

    "the moments @xmath159 and @xmath160 are obtained from this losvd by one - dimensional numerical integration .",
    "moments from the bulge ( see below ) are then added to those of the disk , giving the three projected moment distributions @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 on the sky grid .",
    "moment distributions are convolved with appropriate spatial point - spread functions ( psfs ) for the observing instruments .",
    "the convolved grids are then observed over a slit to obtain one - dimensional kinematics or photometry , or binned for two - dimensional observations .",
    "one - dimensional observations are made by averaging over a slit of width @xmath169 and pixel scale @xmath170 at a given position angle _ pa_. two - dimensional observations are obtained by averaging over a square pixel of scale @xmath170 . averaged moments yield line - of - sight rotation ( @xmath171 ) , velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) , and surface brightness ( @xmath172 ) profiles .",
    "we follow the usual convention that objects moving away from the observer have positive velocities .",
    "to ensure proper functioning of our code , we generated kinematic and photometric profiles using the distribution function for a keplerian disk with constant surface density and a rayleigh distribution of eccentricities ; a rayleigh distribution is equivalent to a schwarzschild distribution in velocity ( dones & tremaine 1993 ) .",
    "these profiles were compared with similar profiles generated from analytically determined velocity moments of the distribution .",
    "moments were projected onto the sky , convolved by numerical integration with a psf , and then observed over a slit for the comparison .",
    "close agreement was found for the foc , stis , and sis slits at numerous position angles ( see section [ sec : chap3 ] for instrument specifications ) .",

    "the bulge model is expressed in physical units by two additional parameters , @xmath176 and @xmath177 , which represent the total bulge mass and scale length , respectively .",
    "the bulge is always centered on the bh .",
    "scaling to physical units requires specification of the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath178 ) and the distance ( @xmath179 ) to the nuclear disk s host galaxy .",
    "losvds can change significantly over small spatial scales , so it is necessary to use a finer grid for their computation and convolution .",
    "we find the full losvd at any given point on the sky by constructing a @xmath180 data cube centered on that point .",
    "the first two dimensions represent the spatial coordinates , while the third represents the losvd at that point .",
    "we set the spatial length per pixel to @xmath181 and bin velocities to an instrument - specific resolution .",
    "the spatial scale extends beyond @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the width of the observing instrument s psf and @xmath169 is the width of the observing slit .",
    "the data cube is built following a procedure similar to that described previously for the moment distributions , with the exception that now the losvd is recorded into the data cube instead of having the velocity moments calculated .",
    "the contribution of the bulge to the total losvd is described by a gaussian with the projected dispersion of the appropriate @xmath93-model .",
    "convolution is performed by marching through the cube in velocity and convolving each two - dimensional cut with the psf .",

    "this results from the singular nature of the gaussian form of @xmath94 at @xmath100 ( see section [ s.df ] ) .",
    "the singularity causes there to be two orbit populations : first , a normal population of eccentric orbits around @xmath97 , and second , an extra population of circular orbits from the singularity .",

    "this value is more than @xmath341 larger than the upper limit for our measurement .",
    "understanding this discrepancy is difficult , due to fundamental differences in model approximations .",
    "pt03 ignore disk self - gravity and precession , but include the three - dimensional structure of the disk ; our disks include self - gravity and precession , but are assumed to be thin , and limited to two dimensions .",
    "pt03 suggest that ignoring the disk self - gravity is likely to cause the bh mass to be @xmath342 too large . however , it is unknown how including both self - gravity and precession together would further affect their mass value , especially if the precession rate is as large as we find in our models ( @xmath343 ) .",
    "similarly , it is difficult to ascertain how including a vertical structure to our disks would affect @xmath3 , @xmath87 , and possibly other parameters .",
    "results from pt03 suggest that some vertical structure is needed to match the photometry .",
    "their non - aligned model reproduces the well - defined double structure of m31 s nucleus , whereas our two - dimensional simulations produce crescent - shaped p1 structures .",
    "the dip in surface brightness between p1 and p2 is reproduced in their models , even with the disk at @xmath344 ; our models possess overly - strong central surface brightness minima , unless a strong bulge cusp is included in the model .",

    "using results from studies of disk heating by two - body relaxation in protoplanetary disks ( ohtsuki , stewart , & ida 2002 ) , they show that their non - aligned disk must have a vertical - to - radial axis ratio of @xmath345 in the radius range @xmath346 .",
    "this being said , pt03 point out that the effect on the kinematics is less dramatic than for the photometry . since weighting of the data is dominated by one and two - dimensional kinematics in our best fits ( table [ t.results2 ] ) , our value for the bh mass should suffer only minor modulation with the addition of the third dimension .",
    "vertical dispersion would increase the overall line of sight velocity dispersion , while minimally affecting the rotation curve ; this would improve the fit in models like model 2 ( figure [ f.1dkinbest1 ] ) , which has a small dispersion spike .",
    "pt03 present bulge - subtracted losvds from unpublished stis observations of m31 s nucleus ( bender et al .",
    "2003 ) at a few locations within @xmath347 of the uv peak , along with model losvds extending another @xmath348 , in their figure 15 .",
    "we show corresponding losvds for models 14 and 13 as solid and dotted lines in figure [ f.losvds1413 ] , respectively .",

    "are their losvds at @xmath349 and @xmath18 , both of which show a small bump near @xmath350 ; our losvds also show these bumps , which occur at supracircular velocities , as indicated by the arrows in our figure [ f.losvds1413 ] .",
    "supracircular peaks occur when the tangent point falls near the pericenters of orbits with substantial eccentricity .",
    "such features arise from the density and eccentricity structure of the disk , and can be used as sensitive discriminants of disk structure in m31 ( salow & statler 2001 ) .",
    "model losvds from pt03 do not have multiple maxima ; instead , they find asymmetric losvds with strong wings toward prograde velocities .",
    "however , their losvds between @xmath351 and @xmath352 have a shoulder that appears to move inward toward @xmath268 in the same manner as the bump at supracircular velocities does in our losvds .",
    "this may be a signature of the tangent point traversing the pericenters of eccentric orbits , with the gap between the maxima somehow filled in by the density structure of the disk .",
    "we show disk - only losvds at the resolution of stis along the kinematic axis ( _ pa_@xmath353 ) in figure [ f.losvdsprop ] for models 14 , 12 , and 10 from table [ t.results2 ] , which have bh masses of @xmath354 , @xmath355 , and @xmath356 , respectively .",
    "these are shown as predictions for upcoming stis observations , which should yield @xmath357 in the @xmath358 region , and allow detailed features in the losvd to be seen ( cycle 12 id-9859 , e. emsellem , pi ) .",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath256 , and @xmath87 all increase from model 10 to model 14 to model 12 .",
    "the most significant differences in losvds are seen between model 10 and the other two , mostly due to the @xmath359 inclination difference .",
    "losvds for models 14 and 12 are similar throughout much of the near - uv peak region , though there are measurable differences in the number of maxima and their strength and location , especially between @xmath360 and @xmath361 .",
    "thus , with high s / n , it should be possible to differentiate between models using losvds .    the bender et al .",
    "( 2003 ) velocity dispersion profiles presented in pt03 ( their figure 12 ) deserve special mention .",
    "the dispersion spike in their bulge - subtracted stis profile is offset from the uv peak by only @xmath362 , compared to the @xmath363 offset found by b01 in both stis ( their figure 11 ) and slit - averaged oasis ( their figure 8) dispersion profiles .",
    "the large offset can not be reproduced by our models .",
    "but the @xmath364 discrepancy suggests that there may be a problem with the positional registration of the data in either the bender et al .",
    "( 2003 ) or b01 results .",
    "the bender et al .",
    "results are bulge - subtracted , unlike in b01 , but the addition of a bulge component should move the dispersion spike slightly closer to the uv peak , not away from it , if the bh is centered in the bulge .",
    "bender et al.s profile is favored by our models , which typically have the dispersion spike only slightly offset toward p2 ; for example , the dispersion profile for model 10 ( figure [ f.1dkinbest2 ] ) has a dispersion spike offset of @xmath365 from the uv peak .",
    "if the dispersion spike really is offset from the uv peak by @xmath37 toward p2 , then either our models are essentially correct but missing a key ingredient , or the basic assumptions of the model incorrectly describe m31 s nucleus .",
    "this second possibility is unlikely , given that our models are able to reproduce many of the key features in both the kinematic and photometric data ; the same holds true for models presented in t95 , kb99 , b01 , salow & statler ( 2001 ) , ss02 , jacobs & sellwood ( 2001 ) , and pt03 . as for the first possibility ,",
    "one suggestion is the addition of retrograde orbits .",
    "our models include only prograde orbits .",
    "ss02 , who build their model using an orbit library with both prograde and retrograde orbits , find that the fit near p2 is improved greatly with the addition of retrograde orbits comprising only @xmath366 of the total disk mass .",
    "however , the dispersion spike in their model is located very close to the uv peak , even with retrograde orbits ( see their figure 4 ) . as a rough test , we added velocity moments from retrograde orbits comprising @xmath367 to a few models before convolution with the psf .",
    "a set of retrograde periodic orbits was found numerically in the same way as was done for the prograde orbits , and the moments were found using the df , as in section [ s.construction ] .",
    "we similarly found that the dispersion spike did not significantly move .",
    "it should be noted that these tests were performed using the same @xmath103 and other disk parameters , excepting @xmath256 , as the main eccentric disk itself , which may not realistically describe the hypothetical retrograde population .",
    "using a simple heuristic velocity model , b01 find that the best overall fit to foc , stis and slit - averaged oasis kinematics requires a high velocity component in the central @xmath368 aligned with the kinematic axis .",
    "this component is added to reproduce the abrupt jump in the foc rotation curve near @xmath369 ( see figure [ f.1dkinbest1 ] ) .",
    "b01 argue that , with the addition of this component , the dispersion spike is then just the result of the effect of velocity broadening .",
    "the high velocity component may be related to retrograde orbits .",
    "the question of whether or not retrograde orbits can affect the dispersion spike clearly needs further investigation .",
    "we find that disks with @xmath370 provide the best match to the two - dimensional kinematics and photometry .",
    "this inclination is consistent with that found by deprojecting the nucleus , assuming a thin disk ( b01 , ss02 , p02 ) , and with pt03 s fit for their non - aligned model .",
    "thus , the nuclear disk is most likely not aligned with the large - scale disk of m31 , which is at @xmath371 with the line - of - nodes at _ pa_@xmath372 ( t95 ) .",
    "m31 s bulge is thought to be triaxial , and possibly aligned with the large - scale disk ( lindblad 1956 , stark 1977 , stark & binney 1994 , berman 2001 , berman & loinard 2002 ) .",
    "the nuclear disk should then be subject to dynamical friction from the bulge , which acts to damp the inclination difference on the precession time ( @xmath373 yr ; pt03 and references therein ) . at that timescale ,",
    "the inclination difference should have been damped out long ago , since absorption - index radial profiles suggest that the age of the nuclear disk is roughly @xmath374 that of the bulge ( silchenko et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is on order of a hubble time .",
    "however , the recent photometric decomposition by p02 suggests that the inner bulge may be spherical , rather than triaxial .",
    "p02 finds that the overall bulge is fit best by two components ; an inner , nearly spherical component ( axis ratio @xmath375 ) described by a srsic ( 1968 ) light profile with effective radius @xmath376 and exponent @xmath377 , and a large - scale , more elliptical component ( @xmath378 ) described by a nuker law ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 ) of break radius @xmath379 and an asymptotic inner power law slope @xmath380 .",
    "the mass of the spherical component is @xmath381 , roughly half of the mass of the bh .",
    "if this is correct , then the bulge potential is spherical around the nucleus , which might allow the non - aligned orientation to survive , even if the outer bulge is triaxial .",
    "another possible way to avoid dynamical friction from the bulge is to have an axisymmetric bulge which is aligned with the nuclear disk ( pt03 ) .",
    "it is intriguing that ruiz ( 1976 ) finds that an axisymmetric bulge is consistent with kinematic and photometric data if @xmath382 .",
    "all of the models presented in this paper have a backbone orbit sequence , @xmath97 , similar to that shown for model 14 ( the solid line in figure [ f.densorbeofa]c ) , in which there is no tendency for the orbits to switch their apoapses to the p2 side of the disk following the large negative eccentricity gradient .",
    "this is contrary to the the findings of s99 and salow & statler ( 2001 ) .",
    "b01 and ss02 also find @xmath383s similar to that for model 14 , though with a larger maximum eccentricity ( @xmath384 ) .",
    "many of our models do , however , show such a switch at low semimajor axis , before the maximum in @xmath97 ( see the dotted line in figure [ f.densorbeofa]c ) , as in salow & statler ( 2001 ) .",
    "tremaine ( 2001 ) finds such a switch on both sides of a maximum in @xmath385 , where @xmath386 is the radius from the central massive object , for certain slow @xmath387-modes in nearly keplerian disks with softened gravity , using the wkb approximation ( see his figures 6 and 9 ) ; self - gravitating disks with significant velocity dispersion support prograde `` pressure '' modes , corresponding to tremaine s @xmath387-modes ( b01 ) . models like ours can , in principle , possess @xmath97s with an eccentricity sign switch after maximum , or on both sides of maximum , but only if @xmath87 is decreased by about @xmath388 from the values we find in our fits to m31 .",
    "for example , figure [ f.extendeofa]a in appendix [ app_2 ] shows @xmath97 for an arbitrary model with @xmath389 and @xmath390 .",
    "the small value for @xmath257 in our models ( @xmath391 ) is a consequence of the large precession rate ( @xmath392 ) .",
    "lagrange s planetary equations for the secular evolution orbital elements undergoing an external perturbation have @xmath393 , where @xmath394 is the mean motion and @xmath395 is the disturbing function , or perturbing potential ( murray & dermott 1999 ) ; thus , @xmath396 .",
    "models in b01 and ss02 have larger values for @xmath257 ( @xmath321 ) and lower precession rates ( @xmath309 and @xmath310 , respectively ) , in agreement with the rough trend @xmath397 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the precession rate measured using the tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) method gives @xmath398 and @xmath314 for a nuker and srsic fit to the bulge ( sambhus & sridhar 2000 ) , respectively , both of which are consistent with our value for @xmath87 .",
    "the question of how the eccentric disk formed in m31 is still an open question .",
    "currently , two formation scenarios are favored : first , that an initially axisymmetric disk becomes lopsided due to an external perturbation ( t95 , b01 , p02 , pt03 ) , or by a dynamical instability ( touma 2002 , ss02 ) ; second , that the disk is formed when an infalling star cluster is tidally stripped by the central bh ( bekki 2000 , quillen & hubbard 2003 ) .",
    "the external perturbation may come from a globular cluster or giant molecular cloud passing by the disk ( b01 , p02 ) , or by the influence of dynamical friction from the bulge ( t95 , pt03 ) , both of which may excite the mean eccentricity of the disk . using a softened analogue of the laplace - lagrange secular theory for interacting planar",
    "keplerian rings , touma ( 2002 ) showed that a small fraction of counter - rotating stars is sufficient to cause a pre - existing disk to develop a linear @xmath81 instability .",
    "the retrograde orbits may have originated from a tidally disrupted stellar cluster on a retrograde orbit ( ss02 ) ; tremaine et al . ( 1975 ) have shown that dynamical friction can cause globular clusters to spiral into the nucleus and be tidally disrupted .",
    "bekki ( 2000 ) performed n - body simulations in which a globular cluster is disrupted by a massive bh , and found that a long - lived eccentric disk can be produced .",
    "the progenitor cluster , however , was only about one - tenth as massive as the disk in m31 . from simple tidal disruption arguments in a single disruption - event scenario , quillen & hubbard ( 2003 )",
    "show that many galactic globular clusters satisfy core radius and density requirements necessary for the formation of an eccentric disk near the bh , supporting bekki s simulations .",
    "normal globular clusters are not massive enough , however , to be plausible progenitors , and their colors are unlike those in the nucleus . instead , quillen & hubbard suggest that a dense bulge core or nuclear star cluster might be the progenitor , since both can be massive and compact enough to satisfy requirements for m31 .",
    "they point out that if merging galaxy bulges can form eccentric disks , then such disks would be a natural consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "an interesting connection may exist between the disruption - event scenario and the spherical inner bulge found by p02 .",
    "milosavljevic & merritt ( 2001 ) perform n - body simulations of merging stellar systems with black holes , and find that the inward - spiraling binary black holes scatter stars from the center via gravitational slingshot .",
    "p02 suggests that these ejected stars could form a spherical distribution after redistribution in phase space .",
    "if this is true , then the presence of the spherical bulge component would lend support to the idea that the disk formed during a merger of galaxies with central bhs .",
    "our models of eccentric stellar disks around central black holes incorporate self - gravity , finite velocity dispersion , and gravity - induced precession , in a self - consistent way .",
    "we have used these models to perform the first detailed fit to the nucleus of m31 which includes both one and two - dimensional kinematics and photometry ; the data set includes foc , stis , and sis one - dimensional kinematics , oasis two - dimensional kinematics , and one and two - dimensional wfpc2 photometry .",
    "the primary result of this modeling effort is an accurate measurement of the mass of the central black hole in m31 .",
    "we find that @xmath1 .",
    "this value is consistent with the @xmath399 correlation ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , which gives a value of @xmath400 .",
    "we find eccentric disks with large precession rates ( @xmath401 ) and small maximum eccentricities ( @xmath402 ) for the backbone orbit sequence , @xmath97 .",
    "the backbone orbits possess a characteristic non - monotonic distribution with a steep negative eccentricity gradient ( @xmath403 ) through the densest part of the disk , which gives rise to distinctive multi - modal losvds for lines of sight near the central bh .",
    "such features may be used to further constrain model parameters when losvds from upcoming high s / n stis observations of m31 s nucleus become available .    although our models provide an accurate estimate for the bh mass , there is room for improvement .",
    "we have assumed that the disk in m31 is thin .",
    "the disk may have non - negligible vertical structure , however , which could slightly alter our bh estimate .",
    "vertical velocity dispersion can be added to our models by including dispersions in inclination , @xmath146 , and in the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath404 , in our prescription for populating quasi - periodic orbits about the backbone orbit sequence .",
    "we would then have a df which includes all five integrals of motion in the three - dimensional kepler problem ; that is , @xmath405 ; pt03 demonstrate how the third dimension can be included in this way .",
    "further improvement may require that new bulge models be considered , to better fit the behavior of the models within the central @xmath406 of the nucleus .",
    "more flexible versions of @xmath103 and a population of retrograde orbits can also help in this regard .",
    "retrograde orbits should be included self - consistently with their own df and parameters , to determine if the location of the dispersion spike can be adjusted by their presence .",
    "the eccentric disk picture for the nucleus of m31 is clearly the correct one , given the success that our models , along with those of other investigators , have at reproducing most of the asymmetric features in the kinematic and photometric data . a complete description of the available data should be possible with models like ours , which already include most of the key physical ingredients , once they are extended as mentioned above .",
    "such models should be flexible enough to probe the connection between the bh and nuclear stars in greater detail , and may yield new clues about the formation of eccentric disks around bhs . with the knowledge gained from detailed study of these models , other systems exhibiting features like those seen in m31 , which do not have resolved keplerian - dominated regions ( @xmath15 ) , can be investigated with confidence , as long as the sphere of influence of the bh ( @xmath407 ) is resolved .",
    "galaxies with central properties similar to those in m31 are already known to exist .",
    "ngc 4486b , a low - luminosity e1 companion of m87 , is already known to possess two brightness peaks ( lauer et al .",
    "this galaxy has no distinct nucleus , however , and its p1-p2 separation is @xmath408 - @xmath409 pc ( @xmath410 at @xmath411 mpc ) , which is about six times that in m31 ; also , its p1 and p2 have nearly the same brightess , unlike in m31 .",
    "models like ours may be applicable , with some modification to the density structure to account for lack of a distinct nucleus .",

    "( 2002 ) , who recently discovered six early - type galaxies with surface brightness profiles that decrease inward near their centers , reminiscent of the central dip in surface brightness found in m31 .",
