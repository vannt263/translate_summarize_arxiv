    "in recent years , compelling evidence for neutrino oscillations has been obtained in atmospheric  @xcite , solar  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and long - baseline accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments .",
    "they have measured with good accuracy the oscillation parameters : two mass squared differences , @xmath11 and , where @xmath12 , and two mixing angles , @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "the third mixing angle @xmath0 is small and strongly constrained .",
    "a combined analysis of all present data gives for the best fit values and the @xmath14 allowed ranges of the measured oscillation parameters  @xcite : @xmath15 the combined limit on the @xmath0 mixing angle reads  @xcite ^2_13 < 0.033  ( 0.050 ) 2 ( 3 )  .",
    "[ th13 ] despite the remarkable , recent progress in our understanding of neutrino physics , fundamental questions need to be addressed in the future in order to shed light on the theory beyond the standard model of particle interactions which is responsible for neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "we need to establish the nature of neutrinos ( whether dirac or majorana particles ) , the neutrino mass ordering ( normal or inverted ) , the absolute neutrino mass scale , the value of the unknown mixing angle @xmath0 , and if the cp - symmetry is violated in the leptonic sector .",
    "in addition , it will be important to determine with better precision the already known oscillation parameters .",
    "a wide , future programme of neutrino oscillation experiments , under discussion at present , addresses some of the issues mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "in particular , long baseline experiments will aim at providing information , first on the values of @xmath0 , and then on the type of neutrino mass ordering and on the value of the cp - violating phase @xmath1 , which enters in 3-neutrino oscillations .",
    "superbeams , neutrino factory and beta - beams are studied in detail .",
    "superbeams extend the present experimental concepts for conventional beams with an upgrade in intensity and in detector size .",
    "various proposals are under consideration or construction : t2k  @xcite in japan ,",
    "no@xmath16a  @xcite in the us , and the possibility of a wide - band beam if @xmath0 turns out to be large  @xcite .",
    "neutrino factories  @xcite and beta - beams  @xcite are novel concepts . in a neutrino factory , muons ( antimuons )",
    "are produced , cooled and accelerated to high lorentz factor before stored in a decay ring .",
    "muon neutrino ( antineutrino ) and electron antineutrino ( neutrino ) beams are produced and aimed at a magnetised detector at very far distance .",
    "magnetisation is necessary in order to separate the right muon disappearance signal from the wrong muon appearance signal , which is sensitive to matter effects and cp violation .",
    "beta - beams  @xcite exploit ions which are accelerated to high lorentz factors , stored and then @xmath17-decay , producing a collimated electron neutrino beam . the typical neutrino energies are in the 200  mev  gev range , requiring detectors with hundred - of - mev thresholds and good energy resolution . lower energies imply shorter baselines and , typically , baselines of few hundred of km are considered .",
    "the only requirement is good muon identification in order to detect the appearance of muon neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) from the initial electron neutrino ( or antineutrino ) beam .",
    "hence , in principle , no magnetisation is required and therefore water erenkov , totally active scintillator , liquid argon detectors and non - magnetised iron calorimeters could be used , depending on the peak energy .",
    "as it is well known , the determination of the mixing angle @xmath0 , the type of neutrino mass hierarchy , if the cp - symmetry is violated in the leptonic sector and the octant of the mixing angle @xmath10 , is severely affected by degeneracies  @xcite . for a fixed baseline and neutrino energy different sets of the unknown parameters @xmath18 provide an equally good fit to the probability for neutrino and antineutrino oscillations .",
    "therefore , a measurement of these probabilities in an experiment , even if very accurate , might not allow to discriminate between the various allowed solutions .",
    "various strategies have been envisaged in order to weaken or resolve this issue : from exploiting the energy dependence of the signal in the same experiment  @xcite , to the combination of different experiments  @xcite , to using more than one baseline for the same beam  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the mixing angle @xmath0 also controls the earth matter effects in multi - gev atmospheric  @xcite and in supernova  @xcite neutrino oscillations , and the magnitude of the t - violating and cp - violating terms in neutrino oscillation probabilities is directly proportional to @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the determination of @xmath0 is crucial for the future possibilities at neutrino oscillation experiments of pinning down the type of mass hierarchy , if the cp - symmetry is violated in the lepton sector and the octant of @xmath10 .    in beta - beam experiments , due to the energy dependence of the neutrino flux and of the relevant cross sections for the interactions in the detector , in general a better sensitivity to the type of hierarchy and cp violation",
    "can be reached for higher gammas and consequently longer baselines  @xcite .",
    "in particular , matter effects increase with distance and energy .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments with baselines of few hundred km , as the cern - frejus option or the t2k superbeam , turn out to have no sensitivity to the sign of , for the allowed values of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "higher energy setups for baselines @xmath20  km have also been studied in detail  @xcite .",
    "equipping the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) with a fast cycling superconducting magnet would provide a fast ramp which would avoid a significant loss of ions by decay in the accelerating phase and would allow to reach high gammas .",
    "the studies in ref .",
    "@xcite considered the reach of this setup using an iron magnetised detector located at gran sasso .",
    "they showed a very good physics reach , using both neutrinos from @xmath21ne and antineutrinos from @xmath22he .",
    "however , longer baselines can be considered in europe .",
    "in particular , it has been recently pointed out that the boulby mine on the north - east coast of england has excellent potential for expansions  @xcite .",
    "this would allow to excavate laboratories able to host detectors with mass of a few tens of ktons , as required in a long baseline experiment .",
    "therefore , boulby constitutes a very interesting option for a future long baseline experiment in europe , allowing for longer distances from cern than frejus , canfranc and gran sasso . in the present article",
    ", we exploit this new opportunity and consider a neutrino beta - beam sourced at cern and a detector located in the boulby mine .",
    "this choice of setup has a baseline of 1050  km that allows a superior sensitivity to matter effects , as well as to cp violation with respect to lower energy possibilities .",
    "as just mentioned , our choice is motivated on one side by the possibility of an upgrade of the accelerator complex at cern and on the other by the recent studies at the boulby mine which indicate the possibility to build large caverns in hard stable rock at this site  @xcite . differently from ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider a detector with low energy threshold and good energy resolution .",
    "this has important physics implications as it allows one to fully exploit the oscillatory pattern of the signal and in particular to be sensitive to both the first and the second oscillation maximum . as the dependence of the signal on cp violation and matter effects is very different at different energies , it is possible to resolve degeneracies and reach an excellent sensitivity with a neutrino run only .",
    "in fact , sufficient information can be extracted from the neutrino signal alone and the antineutrino run , suppressed by small cross sections , does not improve the physics reach and it has not been included in our study .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the beta - beam setup and the resulting neutrino flux . in section iii",
    "we discuss the strategy beyond the choice of experimental setup and in particular we discuss how a neutrino run can resolve degeneracies if the oscillatory pattern of the probability is fully exploited . in sections",
    "iv and v we give the details of the numerical analysis and its results for the physics reach of the setup . finally , in section",
    "vi we draw our conclusions .",
    "first introduced by zucchelli  @xcite , a beta - beam experiment exploits a well collimated neutrino beam produced by the acceleration and subsequent decay of stored @xmath17-emitting ions .",
    "the neutrino flux is very well known since the beta decay is well understood theoretically and all forward going neutrinos are collimated into a cone with opening angle @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the ion boost in the laboratory frame . the dominant factor in the choice of ion",
    "is the need for a high luminosity at the detector site .",
    "potential ions need to have a small proton number to minimise space charge , and half - lives @xmath6 1 second to reduce ion losses during the acceleration while still maintaining a large amount of useful decays per year .",
    "the most promising candidate ions are @xmath21ne and @xmath25b for neutrinos , and @xmath26he and @xmath25li for anti - neutrinos . in table",
    "[ t : distances ] we show , for each of these four isotopes , the energy at the peak of the beta - beam spectrum in the rest frame and the value of this energy in the boosted frame for the current sps and for the upgraded sps .",
    "we also show the baseline for which the peak energy would correspond to the first oscillation maximum of the probability of transition of @xmath27 into @xmath28 .",
    ".energy at the peak of the beta - beam spectrum in the rest frame ( @xmath29 ) and in the boosted frame for the current ( maximum proton energy of 450  gev ) and upgraded ( maximum proton energy of 1  tev ) sps .",
    "also shown the maximum achievable @xmath24 factor in both cases for each isotope .",
    "the maximum baseline , @xmath30 , represents the distance at which the first oscillation maximum of the probability of conversion of @xmath27 into @xmath28 is located .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     realistic background assumptions have been included when computing the simulated data .",
    "we have considered two types of backgrounds : an intrinsic beam - induced background ( taken as a constant fraction , @xmath31 , of the unoscillated events ) plus the atmospheric neutrino contribution . in the energy range of interest , there are about @xmath32 atmospheric neutrino interactions per kton - year which could mimic a muon coming from the oscillated @xmath33  @xcite . assuming a beam duty factor of @xmath34 , the number of muon background events induced by atmospheric muon neutrino interactions would be @xmath35 per kton - year , to be rescaled accordingly to the detector size and the exposure time .",

    "the `` true '' parameter values that we have chosen for these examples are depicted in the figures with a star : we have explored four different values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 and two possible values of @xmath45 ( left panel ) and @xmath46 ( right panel ) .",
    "the simulations are for the normal mass hierarchy and @xmath10 in the first octant ( @xmath47 which corresponds to @xmath48 ) .",
    "the statistics considered corresponds to the optimistic high - statistics scenario , with an exposure of @xmath4 ions - kton - years .",
    "the analysis depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : deg ] includes the study of the discrete degeneracies .",
    "that is , we have fitted the data assuming the wrong hierarchy ( i.e. , negative hierarchy ) and the additional clone solutions ( if present ) are shown in dashed red .",
    "we have also considered the impact of the wrong choice for the @xmath10 octant ( we fitted the data assuming @xmath49 , which corresponds to @xmath50 ) . notice that in fig .",
    "[ fig : deg ] the @xmath10-octant ambiguity is solved at the @xmath40 cl for the values of @xmath1 illustrated .",
    "the additional solutions associated to the wrong choice of the mass hierarchy are not present at the same cl if @xmath51 is small enough , i.e. , @xmath52 . for _ larger _ values of @xmath0 the sign degeneracy is present for some values of the cp - violating phase @xmath1 , but its location is very similar to the simulated true value and therefore the presence of these degeneracies will hardly interfere with the measurement of cp violation .",
    "this behaviour of the @xmath10 degenerate solutions is opposite to the normal case , in which the resolution of the degeneracies gets harder as the value of @xmath0 decreases .",
    "the reason for that is the enormous impact of the solar term at the lower energies and the long baseline exploited here .",

    "the analysis takes into account the impact of both the intrinsic and discrete degeneracies .",
    "[ fig : hier ] shows the region in the ( @xmath55 , `` fraction of @xmath1 '' ) plane for which the mass hierarchy can be resolved at the @xmath40 cl ( 2 d.o.f ) . note that , with a background level of @xmath31 and a beam duty cycle of @xmath34 , the hierarchy can still be determined in both scenarios if @xmath56 ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) for all values of the cp - violating phase @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : cp ] shows the region in the ( @xmath58 , @xmath1 ) plane for which a given ( non - zero ) value of the cp - violating phase @xmath1 can be distinguished at the @xmath40 cl ( 2 d.o.f . ) from the cp - conserving case , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "the results are given for both the low- and high - statistics scenarios .",
    "again , even in the presence of non negligible beam - induced plus atmospheric background levels , the cp - violating phase @xmath1 could be measured with a @xmath40 cl error smaller than @xmath60 if @xmath61 in the high - statistics scenario . finally , the white area in fig .",
    "[ fig : teta ] represents the region in the ( @xmath62 , @xmath1 ) plane for which the octant in which @xmath10 lies can be determined at the @xmath40 cl ( 2 d.o.f ) .",
    "the result is illustrated for the high - statistics scenario .",
    "in general , the resolution of the @xmath10 octant ambiguity is extremely difficult , and in order to eliminate this degeneracy , combining data from different experiments might be crucial  @xcite . here , we benefit from the solar term contribution in the lower energy bins and therefore , the octant ambiguity is resolved for relatively small values of @xmath0 , if the statistics is high enough . for the low luminosity scenario ,",
    "the degeneracy is harder to resolve and it is present ( at the @xmath40 cl ) in almost all the parameter space explored here .",
    "in the present article , we have studied the physics reach of a beta - beam with intermediate @xmath24 and long baseline .",
    "we have considered a neutrino beam sourced by @xmath21ne decays with @xmath63 and a baseline of 1050  km corresponding to the cern - boulby mine distance .",
    "this choice of setup is motivated by the recent studies about the possible upgrade of the sps at cern which would allow to obtain high boost factors for the ions and by the possibility of locating few - ten - kton size detectors at the boulby mine .    in a qualitative way",
    ", we have analytically studied the capability that a neutrino run alone could have to resolve the problem of degeneracies and we have shown that , by exploiting the oscillatory behaviour of the signal , it is possible to fully resolve such degeneracies in a large part of the allowed parameter space .",
    "we have performed a numerical analysis simulating the data for a future beta - beam experiment with an exposure of @xmath36 useful ion decays - kton - years .",
    "realistic backgrounds ( intrinsic plus atmospheric neutrino contamination ) and beam - duty factor ( @xmath34 ) have been considered when computing the @xmath64 function used for this analysis . by exploiting the neutrino data only",
    ", the beta - beam setup presented here can determine the type of neutrino mass hierarchy at the @xmath40  cl , regardless of the value of the cp - violating phase , for values of the mixing parameter @xmath65 larger than @xmath66 , and establish leptonic cp violation if @xmath67 .    if the mixing angle @xmath0 turns out to be very small , a quest for physics answers would evidently require an increase of the exposure quoted above .",
    "we illustrate the physics reach of this beta - beam setup assuming a factor of five improvement in the statistics , considering @xmath54 ions - kton - years . in this high - luminosity scenario",
    ", the value of the cp - violating phase @xmath1 can be measured with a @xmath40  cl error of @xmath60 if @xmath68 , with some sensitivity down to very small values of @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath0 turns out to be small , the octant degeneracy can be resolved through the solar mixing term contribution .    in summary ,",
    "we have analysed a beta - beam setup with a neutrino run and we have found that , by exploiting the oscillatory behaviour of the signal , this option provides a very good overall physics reach , competitive with other setups explored in the literature .",

    "<S> in order to address some fundamental questions in neutrino physics a wide , future programme of neutrino oscillation experiments is currently under discussion . among those , long baseline experiments will play a crucial role in providing information on the value of @xmath0 , the type of neutrino mass ordering and on the value of the cp - violating phase @xmath1 , which enters in 3-neutrino oscillations . here , we consider a beta - beam setup with an intermediate lorentz factor @xmath2 and a baseline of 1050  km . </S>",
    "<S> this could be achieved in europe with a beta - beam sourced at cern to a detector located at the boulby mine in the united kingdom . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the physics potential of this setup in detail and study two different exposures ( @xmath3 and @xmath4  ions - kton - years ) . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the type of neutrino mass hierarchy could be determined at 99% cl , for all values of @xmath1 , for @xmath5 . in the high - exposure scenario , we find that the value of the cp - violating phase @xmath1 could be measured with a 99% cl error of @xmath620@xmath7 if @xmath8 , with some sensitivity down to values of @xmath9 . </S>",
