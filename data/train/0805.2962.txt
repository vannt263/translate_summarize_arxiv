    "if the properties of the sun are consistent with the idea that the sun was randomly selected from all stars , this would indicate that life needs nothing special from its host star and would support the idea that life may be common in the universe .",
    "more particularly , if there is nothing special about the sun , we have little reason to limit our life - hunting efforts to planets orbiting sun - like stars . as an example of the type of anthropic reasoning we are using , consider the following situation .",
    "suppose uranium ( a low abundance element in the solar system and in the universe ) was central to the biochemistry of life on earth .",
    "further , suppose that a comparison of our sun to other stars showed that the sun had more uranium than any other star .",
    "how should we interpret this fact ?",
    "the most reasonable way to proceed would be to try to evaluate the probability that such a coincidence happened by chance and to determine whether we are justified in reading some importance into it .",
    "although a correlation does not necessarily imply cause , we think that a correlation between the sun s anomalous feature and life s fundamental chemistry would be giving us important clues about the conditions necessary for life .",
    "specifically , the search for life around other stars as envisioned by the nasa s terrestrial planet finder or esa s darwin project and as currently underway with seti would change the strategy to focus on the most uranium - rich stars .",
    "another example : suppose the sun had the highest [ fe / h ] of all the stars that had ever been observed .",
    "then high [ fe / h ] would be strongly implicated as a precondition for our existence , possibly by playing a crucial role in terrestrial planet formation .",
    "these are exaggerated examples of the more subtle correlations that a detailed and comprehensive comparison of the sun with other stars could reveal .    whether the sun is a typical or atypical star with respect to 1 or",
    "a few properties has been addressed in previous studies . using an approach similar to ours ( comparing solar to stellar properties from particular samples ) ,",
    "some studies have suggested that the sun is a typical star @xcite , while other studies have suggested that the sun is an atypical star @xcite .",
    "this apparent disagreement arises from three problems :    \\1 .",
    "language used to describe whether the sun is , or is not typical , is often confusingly qualitative .",
    "for example , reporting the sun as `` metal - rich '' , can mean that the sun is _ significantly _ more metal - rich than other stars ( e.g.  more metal - rich than @xmath7 of other stars ) or it can mean that the sun is _ insignificantly _ metal - rich ( e.g.  more metal - rich than @xmath8 of other stars ) .",
    "selection effects : stellar samples chosen for the comparison can be biased with respect to the property of interest .",
    "\\3 . inclusion ( or exclusion ) of stellar properties for which it is suspected or known that the sun is atypical , will make the sun appear more atypical ( or typical ) .    in this paper",
    "we address problem 1 by using only quantitative measures when comparing the sun s properties to other stars .",
    "our main interest is to move beyond the qualitative assessment of the sun as either typical or atypical , and obtain a more precise quantification of the degree of the sun s ( a)typicality .",
    "in other words , we want to answer the question ` how typical is the sun ? ' rather than ` is the sun typical or not ? '",
    "there are at least two ways to quantify how typical the sun is .",
    "this can be done for individual parameters by determining how many stars have values below or above the solar value ( table [ table : sum ] ) .",
    "this can also be done by a joint analysis of multiple parameters ( table [ table : chiimprovedp ] ) .",
    "if there are several subtle factors that have some influence over habitability , a quantitative joint analysis of the sun s properties may allow us to identify these factors without invoking largely speculative arguments linking specific properties to habitability .    with respect to problem 2 , most previous analyses have compared the sun to subsets of sun - like stars selected to be sun - like with respect to 1 or more parameters . in such analyses",
    ", the sun will appear typical with respect to any parameter(s ) correlated with 1 of the pre - selected sun - like parameters .",
    "for example , elemental abundances [ x / h ] are correlated with metallicity is the fractional abundance of fe relative to hydrogen , compared to the same ratio in the sun : ] [ fe / h ] .",
    "the sample of @xcite was selected to have a wide range of [ fe / h ] .",
    "this produced a metallicity distribution unrepresentative of stars in general . recognizing this , @xcite conditioned on solar metallicity , [ fe / h@xmath9 \\approx 0 $ ] and then compared solar abundances for 12 elements to the abundances in a group of nearby stars with solar iron abundance , solar age and solar galactocentric radius .",
    "they found the sun to be `` a quite typical star for its metallicity , age and galactic orbit '' .",
    "similarly , @xcite , after comparing various properties of the sun to solar - type stars ( stars of similar mass and age ) , concluded that the sun seems very normal for its mass and age ; `` the sun , to a remarkable degree , is solar type '' .",
    "the stellar samples we use for comparison with the sun are , in our judgement , the least - biased samples currently available for such a comparison .    to address problem 3 , in section [ sec : data ] we compare the sun to other stars using a large number ( 11 ) of maximally - independent properties with plausible correlations with habitability .",
    "these properties can be observed or derived for a sufficiently large , representative stellar sample ( table [ table : samples1 ] ) .",
    "any property of the sun or its environment which must be special to allow habitability would show up in our analysis .",
    "however , in contrast to previous analyses which have looked for solar anomalies with respect to individual properties , we perform a joint analysis that enables us to quantify how typical the solar values are , taken as a group . in section [ sec : jointa ] , the differences between the solar values and the stellar samples medians are used to perform first a simple and then an improved version of a @xmath3-analysis to estimate whether the solar values are characteristic of a star selected at random from the stellar samples .",
    "the results of our joint analysis are presented in figure [ fig : sum ] of section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we find that the solar values , taken as a group , are consistent with the sun being a random star . however , there are important caveats to this interpretation associated with the compromise between the number of properties analyzed , and their plausibility of being correlated with habitability . in sections",
