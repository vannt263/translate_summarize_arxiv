    "the _ water - wave problem _ concerns the gravity - driven flow of a perfect fluid of unit density ; the flow is bounded below by a rigid horizontal bottom @xmath0 and above by a free surface @xmath1 , where @xmath2 depends upon the horizontal spatial coordinate @xmath3 and time @xmath4 .",
    "_ steady waves _ are waves which propagate from left to right with constant speed @xmath5 and without change of shape , so that @xmath6 .",
    "_ solitary waves _ are steady waves which have the property that @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "we consider in this paper the particle trajectories in a fluid as a solitary wave propagates on the free surface , assuming that the flow admits a negative vorticity decreasing with depth .",
    "there have been a series of works concentrating on the study of solitary waves , in the setting of both irrotational flows @xcite etc . , and rotational flows which become active only in the last few years .",
    "one of the interests in the above works is the description of individual particle path in the fluid . in _ irrotational _",
    "flow , particle paths underneath a solitary wave are investigated in @xcite , both for the smooth solitary wave and the solitary wave of greatest height for which the crest is a stagnation point .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in an irrotational solitary water wave , each particle is transported in the wave direction but slower than the wave speed ; as the solitary wave propagates , all particles located ahead of the wave crest are lifted while those behind have a downward motion , with the particle trajectory having asymptotically the same height above the flat bed . for _ rotational _ flow ,",
    "some results on particle paths under _ periodic _ waves are obtained ( cf .",
    "@xcite for instance ) , following a series of works on the corresponding results in irrotational case ( see @xcite etc ) .",
    "recently , rigorous existence results on small - amplitude solitary waves with arbitrary vorticity distribution were obtained in @xcite and in @xcite , using generalized implicit function theorem of nash - moser type and spatial dynamics method , respectively .",
    "the solitary waves established in @xcite are of elevation and decays exponentially to a horizontal laminar flow far up- and downstream .",
    "the study of solitary waves of large - amplitude with an arbitrary distribution of vorticity remains open .",
    "so this arises the question of particle paths in a rotational small - amplitude solitary wave . following the pattern in @xcite for irrotational case , we prove in this work the corresponding results on particle paths in rotational solitary waves by using the properties of solutions obtained in @xcite .",
    "we consider in this work only solitary waves with negative vorticity , however with modifications our arguments can be applied also for positive vorticity .",
    "precisely we show that if the vorticity is negative and increasing from bottom to surface of the flow , and if the underlying current is favorable , i.e. , is moving throughout the fluid in the same direction as the wave , then as time goes on the particle moves similarly as in the irrotational case @xcite .",
    "we also show that if the underlying current is not favorable , then in solitary waves with sufficiently small amplitude , some particles above the flat bed move to the opposite direction of wave propagation along a path with a single loop or a single hump .",
    "note that this single - loop kind of path does not exist in the irrotational case . in @xcite , as in most of the works on waves with vorticity , the author considered only waves that are not near breaking or stagnation , i.e. , the speed of an individual fluid particle is far less than that of the wave itself throughout the fluid domain .",
    "we consider only such waves as well .",
    "we do not consider the case of wave with stagnation which is however studied in @xcite in the irrotational case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec p ]",
    "we present the mathematical formulation for the solitary waves and recall from @xcite some useful properties of the established solitary wave solutions .",
    "section [ sec v ] contains some conclusions on the vertical and horizontal velocity that are relevant for our purposes .",
    "the main result is presented and proved in section [ sec r ] . in the final section",
    "we give two examples which lie in our settings .",
    "we first describe the governing equations for rotational solitary water waves and then recall some properties available on their solitary wave solutions .      choose cartesian coordinates @xmath9 so that the horizontal @xmath3-axis is in the direction of wave propagation and the @xmath10-axis points upwards .",
    "consider steady waves traveling at constant speed @xmath11 . in the frame of reference moving with the wave , which is equivalent to the change of variables @xmath12",
    ", we use @xmath13 to denote the stationary fluid domain and @xmath14 to denote denote the velocity field , and define the _ stream function _ @xmath15 by @xmath16 and @xmath17 consider also only waves that are not near breaking or stagnation , so that @xmath18 in @xmath19 for some @xmath20 , which implies that the vorticity @xmath21 is globally a function of the stream function @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath23 ; see @xcite .",
    "the solitary - wave problem is then , for given @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; { \\mathbb{r}})$ ] , to find a real parameter @xmath26 , a domain @xmath27 and a function @xmath28 such that @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the gravitational constant of acceleration , @xmath31 is the relative mass flux ( independent of @xmath32 ) , and the boundary conditions ( [ eta to 0 ] ) and ( [ psi x to 0 ] ) express that the wave profile approaches a constant level of depth and the flow is almost horizontal in the far field , respectively .",
    "moreover we require that the nontrivial solitary wave is of positive elevation , i.e. , @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "it is therefore symmetric about its single crest and admits a strictly monotone wave profile on either side of this crest ( see @xcite ) . assuming the wave crest is located at @xmath35 , the solitary - wave problem ( [ psi y negative])-([psi x to 0 ] ) is thus supplemented with the symmetry and monotonicity conditions",
    "@xmath36 we refer to @xcite for more details on the derivation of the system ( [ psi y negative])-([psi x to 0 ] ) .",
