    "recent progress in @xmath7-ray spectroscopy has enabled us to study off - yrast levels and associated e2 transitions in rapidly rotating nuclei . the observed rotational bands lie near the yrast line and they are well described as quasi - particle or particle - hole excitations in a rotating mean field .",
    "excited states which lie at higher intrinsic excitation energy above the yrast line are hardly observed by means of discrete @xmath7-ray spectroscopy not only because individual levels are populated very weakly but also because they do not necessarily form the rotational band structure due to damping of collective rotational motion @xcite .",
    "the damping of collective rotational motion takes place in the energy region where density of many - particle many - hole states in the rotating mean field is high and the residual interaction causes configuration mixing among them . if the rotational damping sets in , e2 decay strength from an excited state spreads out over many final states .",
    "the number of rotational bands existing in a given nucleus is thus limited .",
    "the rotational damping has recently been studied experimentally through the statistical analyses of the quasi - continuum @xmath7-ray spectra emitted from high spin off - yrast states .",
    "the fluctuation analysis method(fam ) @xcite which extracts effective number of e2 decay paths revealed that in @xmath8 rare - earth normally deformed nuclei there are only about 30 rotational band structures at a given rotational frequency and the rotational damping sets in at around 0.8 mev above yrast line .",
    "the occurence of rotational damping is reproduced by a microscopic realistic calculation , which takes into account the configuration mixing in the rotating mean field by means of the shell model diagonalization method @xcite .",
    "it has been argued theoretically that a strong shell effect is expected on the rotational damping in superdeformed nuclei @xcite since the presence of the shell gap in the single particle spectrum decreases dramatically the level density of excited many - particle many - hole configurations .",
    "this shell effect influences the intrinsic excitation energy where the rotational damping sets in . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we performed a systematic analysis for superdeformed nuclei in @xmath4 region by means of the cranked shell model approach and predicted that the onset energy of damping and number of rotational bands are higher / larger than in @xmath8 normally deformed nuclei , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath9 mev and @xmath10 , and they vary significantly as functions of neutron and proton numbers due to the change in the shell gap . the continuum e2 @xmath7-ray spectra associated with superdeformed states are observed experimentally in @xmath11dy @xcite , @xmath12eu @xcite and @xmath2hg @xcite .",
    "so far the fam analysis has been applied to @xmath12eu @xcite for which the theoretical prediction gives a qualitatively consistent account of the number of rotational bands @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    "we will reveal that in addition to the level density effect there exists another kind of shell effect which affects significantly the rotational damping properties , especially the damping width , which is another fundamental quantity characterizing the rotational damping besides @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to demonstrate this",
    ", we investigate in detail off - yrast superdeformed states and associated rotational damping properties in a typical superdeformed nucleus @xmath2hg in the @xmath0 region , and make comparative study with @xmath4 superdeformed nuclei and a typical normally deformed rare - earth nucleus @xmath15yb .",
    "the shell effect discussed here is originated from a shell structure associated with the angular momentum alignment of the single - particle orbits in the cranked mean field . as was discussed previously @xcite",
    "highly aligned single - particle orbits affect the dispersion in rotational frequency of cranked many - particle many - hole states , which is a key quantity governing the rotational damping width . in this paper",
    ", we will show that because of the new shell effect the rotational damping width in superdeformed @xmath2hg becomes remarkably small . as a consequence ,",
    "the mechanism of onset of rotational damping in superdeformed @xmath2hg becomes slightly different from that in @xmath4 superdeformed and @xmath8 normally deformed nuclei .    to this end",
    ", we perform a fully microscopic description of the superdeformed states in the high spin off - yrast region of @xmath2hg by means of the shell model method based on the cranked mean field @xcite .",
    "since the formulation is essentially the same as the previous paper @xcite , it is described only briefly in sec.[sec : form ] . in sec.[sec : results ] we show results obtained by our numerical calculation and characterize the onset of rotational damping and rotational damping width for @xmath2hg . in sec.[sec : discuss ] we discuss the results in order to understand mechanism of striking features in rotational damping in @xmath2hg in terms of the shell effect associated with the single particle alignment structure . in sec.[sec : conclude ] we will make a summary on the shell effects on rotational damping in superdeformed nuclei clarified in the previous and present investigations .",
    "to describe excited superdeformed states in the off - yrast region in @xmath2hg , we first construct unperturbed basis wave functions which are defined as multi - particle multi - hole configurations generated upon diabatic single particle routhian orbits @xcite of cranked nilsson mean - field hamiltonian @xmath16 . here",
    "deformation parameters of the nilsson potential are determined by means of strutinsky minimization scheme @xcite with the pairing correlation energy included .",
    "we consider quadrupole and hexadecupole deformation parameters ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we determine equilibrium deformation at zero rotational frequency .",
    "the shell correction energy for the pairing correlation is included in a standard way @xcite , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is pairing correlation energy gain obtained by the bcs approximation and @xmath20 is the smoothed part obtained with equidistant single particle levels .",
    "single particle levels within @xmath21 mev from the fermi surface are considered .",
    "the pairing coupling constant @xmath22 is determined so that the pairing gap for the equidistant model gives @xmath23 mev .",
    "the total energy , including the liquid drop energy , shell correction energy and @xmath24 , evaluated at zero rotational frequency is minimized with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus we obtained the equilibrium deformation parameters @xmath27 for superdeformed state in @xmath2hg .",
    "the same deformation parameters are used to construct the basis states at high spins because the deformation is considered to change only slightly with increasing spin .",
    "total energy of a basis @xmath28p-@xmath28h configuration @xmath29 is expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is single particle routhian energy for the cranked nilsson hamiltonian . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are expectation value of the angular momentum operator @xmath34 and dynamic moment of inertia , respectively , for the many - body configuration @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the @xmath37 expectation value for the cranked nilsson single particle orbits .",
    "here reference rotational frequency @xmath38 is determined so that @xmath39 is satisfied for the yrast configuration . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the smooth part and the rotating liquid drop energy @xcite , respectively .    as the residual two - body interaction",
    "we adopt the delta interaction , @xmath42 , @xmath43 for like nucleons and @xmath44 for the neutron - proton interaction @xcite .",
    "a shell model hamiltonian matrix for the @xmath28p-@xmath28h basis states @xmath45 is constructed by including the residual two - body interaction and diagonalized numerically for each spin and parity .",
    "the obtained energy eigenstates are linear combinations of unperturbed basis , @xmath46 the e2 transition strength between an initial state @xmath47 at @xmath48 and a final state @xmath49 at @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 assuming that collective e2 transition takes place between the basis states having the same microscopic configuration and the static quadrupole moment @xmath52 is constant for all configurations .",
    "then @xmath53 represents normalized transition strength satisfying @xmath54 .",
    "the single particle levels located within 4.0 mev above / below the fermi surface are taken into account as active orbits in constructing the many - body basis states , and up to five - particle five -hole configurations are included . the energetically lowest 2000 basis states",
    "( for each @xmath55 ) are chosen to diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the model space of the diagonalization is not large enough to describe static pairing correlation which may be important for near - yrast states at low spins .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that the pairing correlation is weakened by the coriolis anti - pairing effect at very high spin and also by the blocking effect for the excited superdeformed states in the off - yrast region .    in the following section",
    "we also show results for superdeformed states in @xmath12eu and @xmath11dy , selected as representatives in the @xmath1 region , and also normally deformed high spin states in a typical rare - earth nucleus @xmath15yb .",
    "the calculational procedure for those nuclei were already described in the previous publications @xcite .",
    "the numerical results shown in this paper are obtained by using the same delta interaction as in @xmath2hg .",
    "it is known that the superdeformed states usually coexist with weakly deformed states in the same nucleus at the same spin and parity .",
    "they do not mix , however , very strongly at high spin regions where there is a potential barrier between the two kinds of states and the level density of weakly deformed states is relatively small . to make comparison with experimental data including low spin region where the mixing may be effective ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account the barrier penetration .",
    "the excited superdeformed states may decay not only via collective e2 but also via statistical e1 transition which becomes possible through the mixing of weakly deformed states @xcite .",
    "since our aim in this paper is to discuss mechanism of rotational damping we leave this effect for future investigation .",
    "in this subsection , we discuss onset property of rotational damping by analyzing onset energy of rotational damping and number of superdeformed rotational bands .    in fig.[flow ]",
    "we display obtained superdeformed levels for parity @xmath56 , signature @xmath57 in @xmath2hg .",
    "energy levels are shown by short horizontal bars .",
    "strong e2 transitions satisfying @xmath58 are plotted with solid lines , which are discrete transitions forming the rotational band structure .",
    "the rigid - body rotor energy @xmath59 mev is subtracted .",
    "the vertical axis indicates approximately the intrinsic excitation energy measured from the yrast line .    it is seen from fig.[flow ] that there are apparently more than 20 rotational bands with even spin and parity in @xmath2hg , which lie between the yrast line and up to @xmath60 mev above yrast .",
    "as the excitation energy increases , the rotational band structure gradually disappears and the rotational damping sets in . to describe this transition more quantitatively",
    ", we calculate an effective number of e2 branches decaying from a state @xmath47 , which is defined by @xmath61 calculating the average value of @xmath62 as a function of intrinsic excitation energy measured from the yrast line(by taking a energy bin of 0.1 mev interval ) , we define onset energy of damping @xmath14 by the condition that @xmath63 . in fig.[number](a ) , we show the obtained onset energy for @xmath2hg as a function of angular momentum together with the results for @xmath4 superdeformed nuclei and normally deformed @xmath15yb .",
    "the onset energy varies in superdeformed @xmath2hg from 1.8 to 1.3 mev with increasing spin .",
    "it is apparently smaller than those for @xmath4 superdeformed nuclei and larger than @xmath15yb .",
    "we define number of rotational bands denoted by @xmath13 by counting at a given spin the levels for which the condition @xmath64 is satisfied for two consecutive decay - in and decay - out e2 transitions .",
    "the numbers for four sets of signature and parity quantum numbers are summed up .",
    "this quantity corresponds to the experimental effective number of paths @xcite which is extracted from the spectral fluctuation at the first ridge of the @xmath65 spectra , which are formed by two consecutive e2 transitions along rotational bands .",
    "the calculated number of rotational bands is shown in fig.[number](b ) as a function of angular momentum .",
    "a noticeable feature is that the number of superdeformed rotational bands in @xmath2hg amounts up to about 150 on average , which is much larger than in the @xmath4 superdeformed nuclei ( see also fig.9 in ref.@xcite ) and typical value 30 of @xmath13 in normally deformed nuclei .",
    "dependence of the number of bands on spin is also distinct in @xmath2hg ; it is about 250 at @xmath66 and decreases as spin increases and takes 150 at @xmath67 and again begins to decrease at @xmath68 and reaches less than 100 at @xmath69 .",
    "the quasi - continuum e2 @xmath7 rays associated with superdeformed states are observed in @xmath2hg in the spin region @xmath70 @xcite , but there is no direct experimental information , such as @xmath13 , concerning the onset of rotational damping .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss in detail the damping width of collective rotational motion . as excitation energy exceeds the onset energy of damping , e2 strength decaying from an excited state",
    "is fragmented over several or more final states and distributed within a certain interval of @xmath7-ray energy @xmath71 , corresponding to the rotational damping width @xmath72 .",
    "the distribution is expressed by a single - step e2 strength function defined by @xmath73 where the summation of @xmath47 runs over the initial states at @xmath48 in an energy bin , whereas @xmath49 runs over all final states at @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ strfn1 ] shows the calculated e2 strength distribution @xmath74 associated with an ensemble in an energy bin composed of 201st to 300th levels at each @xmath75 and averaged over parities .",
    "this ensemble of levels corresponds to the energy region , @xmath76 3.8 , 3.6 and 2.4 mev above yrast for @xmath12eu , @xmath11dy and @xmath2hg , respectively , which is much higher than the onset energy by about 1 - 2 mev .",
    "the distribution for lower energy bins(_e.g .",
    "_ , those of 1st-100th and 101st-200th ) is not very different from that shown in fig.[strfn1 ] .",
    "the calculated strength distribution has the centroid corresponding to @xmath77(@xmath78 being the moment of inertia ) and the distribution width is broadened with increasing spin .",
    "the distributions in @xmath11dy and @xmath2hg are split into two peaks at very high spins .",
    "this splitting comes from high-@xmath79 intruder orbits coming down close to the fermi surface with increasing spin . since the configurations occupying the high-@xmath79 orbit @xmath80 for @xmath11dy or @xmath81 for @xmath2hg , have larger angular momentum alignment by sizable amount than the other ones , transitions associated with configurations occupying or excluding the high-@xmath79 orbits form peaks at different @xmath7-ray energies .",
    "it is useful to extract rotational damping width from the e2 distributions .",
    "however , it is difficult to define the fwhm because of the two - peak structure of the distribution at higher spins .",
    "an alternative definition may be given by the standard deviation @xmath82 of the strength distribution @xmath74 and we define the width @xmath83 by @xmath84 . the evaluated @xmath83 averaged over both signatures and parities is shown in fig.[width1 ] .",
    "it is noted that @xmath83 in @xmath2hg is quite small @xmath85 kev at lower spins and increases with increasing spin . on the other hand @xmath83 for @xmath12eu",
    "is @xmath86 kev , which is as large as for @xmath8 normally deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "that for @xmath11dy is @xmath87 kev , which is sizably smaller than @xmath12eu though it is twice as large as that for @xmath2hg .",
    "we remark that the quantity @xmath88 may overestimate the rotational damping width when the rotational damping is not well developed .",
    "for example , if it is calculated for energy bins of near - yrast levels below the onset energy of damping , @xmath88 represents statistical dispersion of undamped e2 @xmath7-ray energies which differ from band to band while the rotational damping width should be zero .    another way to extract the rotational damping width",
    "may be derived from correlation between two consecutive rotational e2 transitions since the correlation distinguishes the damped transitions and rotational band structure more clearly .",
    "this idea is adopted also in the analysis of the experimental @xmath89 spectra @xcite .",
    "the correlation can be represented by a function , @xmath90 which we call the two - step strength function . here",
    "the summation runs over two consecutive transitions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the decay - in transitions from @xmath47 at @xmath48 to @xmath91 at @xmath50 and decay - out transitions from @xmath91 to @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "an average is taken over levels @xmath91 in an energy bin .",
    "if we assume a simple lorentzian distribution for the first transition @xmath94 and the second one @xmath95 , @xmath96 become a convolution of the two lorentzian distributions and the fwhm of @xmath96 is equal to twice of the rotational damping width .",
    "thus it will be possible to define the rotational damping width as a half value of fwhm of @xmath96 .",
    "we use different notation @xmath97 for this quantity to distinguish it from @xmath88 .    the calculated two - step strength function @xmath96 shown in fig.[strfn2 ] does not necessarily show a simple lorentzian nor gaussian shape for the energy bin covering the onset region of damping .",
    "this is because there coexist undamped transitions which form rotational band structure , scars of rotational bands embedded in the damped region ( they contribute to the narrow distribution ) and fragmented damped transitions ( producing wide distribution with width of @xmath98 ) @xcite . as the excitation energy increases the wide component dominates as seen for the energy bin covering the 201st-300th levels . from this energy bin",
    "we extract the rotational damping width @xmath97 , which is plotted in fig.[width2 ] .",
    "it is noted that the two - step strength function @xmath96 has smooth profile in contrast to the two - peak behavior in the single - step strength function @xmath99 .",
    "for this reason and the possible overestimate in @xmath88 , we refer mainly to @xmath97 as the rotational damping width @xmath72 in the following discussion .",
    "it is seen from fig.[width2 ] that the rotational damping width @xmath97 is @xmath100 kev for @xmath2hg , @xmath101 kev for @xmath11dy and @xmath102 kev for @xmath12eu .",
    "noticeable features are that the rotational damping width in @xmath2hg is smaller by more than factor 4 than that in @xmath12eu , and that there is factor 2 difference between @xmath12eu and @xmath11dy in spite of similar mass number and deformation . these features are also seen in @xmath88 .",
    "so far there seems no experimental analysis that extracts directly rotational damping width associated with superdeformed states .",
    "in this section we discuss in detail the numerical results shown in the previous section with focuses on two distinctive features found in superdeformed @xmath2hg , _",
    "i.e. _ , ( i ) very small rotational damping width , @xmath103 kev and ( ii ) quite large number of rotational bands , @xmath104 .      in order to understand the small rotational damping width in @xmath2hg , it is instructive to recall the discussion by lauritzen et.al @xcite on the basic features of rotational damping width .",
    "the unperturbed basis rotational bands , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath28p-@xmath28h configurations in the cranked mean - field potential , have different rotational frequencies at a given spin value , depending on intrinsic particle and hole configurations .",
    "once the residual interaction is taken into account , it causes mixing among the unperturbed rotational bands and an energy eigenstate becomes a superposition of different basis states at the same spin . under these circumstances ,",
    "the rotational damping width is estimated to be @xmath105 in terms of the statistical dispersion of e2 transition energies @xmath106 associated with basis bands @xmath29 or dispersion @xmath107 of rotational frequencies @xmath108 if the spreading width of basis states ( due to the configuration mixing ) @xmath109 is relatively small compared with the dispersion of rotational frequencies @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) . in the other case ( @xmath112 ) ,",
    "the rotational damping width is estimated as @xmath113 which is smaller than the estimate eq.([ewidth ] ) ( _ i.e. _ , the motional narrowing ) . in any case",
    ", the damping width depends strongly ( linearly or quadruticly ) on the dispersion of rotational frequency @xmath110 .",
    "the dispersion of rotational frequency may be evaluated in two ways .",
    "a direct way is just to calculate numerically the variance of e2 transition energies @xmath114 associated with the basis states @xmath29 obtained in the microscopic calculation .",
    "namely , @xmath115 where the average is taken over an ensemble of states in an energy bin . in fig.[disp - spin](a ) we show the calculated dispersion(times factor four ) @xmath116 for the lowest 200 levels at each spin and parity as a function of spin for the three superdeformed nuclei and a normally deformed nucleus @xmath15yb .",
    "we plot @xmath116 since it corresponds to the simple analytic estimate of the rotational damping width ( see eq.([ewidth ] ) ) .",
    "the bin of lowest 200 levels has average excitation energy of @xmath117 , and 1.8 mev above the yrast line for @xmath15yb , @xmath12eu , @xmath11dy , and @xmath2hg , respectively .",
    "it covers the onset region of rotational damping .",
    "another approximate evaluation can be made by introducing a thermal grand canonical ensemble of excited configurations in terms of cranked nilsson orbits @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath118 where it is assumed that nuclear shape is stable and the moment of inertia @xmath78 does not depend very much on intrinsic configurations ( this can be justified in stably deformed nuclei ) . in this case dispersion in the rotational frequency @xmath108 of the @xmath28p-@xmath28h states",
    "is determined by the thermal fluctuation in the alignment @xmath119 which is expressed in terms of the single - particle alignments @xmath120 of the cranked nilsson routhian orbits and the fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 being the single particle routhian energy and the fermi energy .",
    "calculated dispersion @xmath124 is shown in fig.[disp - spin](b ) . here",
    "the temperature @xmath125 is chosen so that average excitation energy @xmath126 agrees with the average energy of the ensemble shown in fig.[disp - spin](a ) .",
    "characteristic features of @xmath127 seen in fig.[disp - spin](a ) are : 1 ) @xmath127 varies quite significantly for different nuclei .",
    "it becomes the smallest ( @xmath128 kev ) in @xmath2hg at not very large spins ( @xmath129 ) , which is about four times smaller than that in @xmath12eu and normally deformed @xmath15yb .",
    "it differs by about factor two between superdeformed @xmath12eu and @xmath11dy although the mass number and deformation is rather similar .",
    "2 ) @xmath127 increases as a function of spin ( as can be expected from an analytic estimate @xcite , see also eq.([harmonic ] ) ) , but it exhibits strong non - linear dependence on spin .",
    "it is noticed that @xmath130 shown in fig.[disp - spin](a ) agrees quite well with the `` rotational damping width '' @xmath83 , shown in fig.[width1 ] , which is estimated from the dispersion of the single - step e2 strength function @xmath74 .",
    "the rotational damping width @xmath131 extracted from the two - step correlation ( fig.[width2 ] ) also reflects the above characteristic features .",
    "the approximate estimate @xmath132 based on the grand canonical ensemble , shown in fig.[disp - spin](b ) , gives essentially the same results as @xmath127 , and the two characteristic features discussed above are also seen .",
    "these observations indicate that the characteristic behaviors of the dispersion @xmath133 of rotational frequency and the rotational damping width @xmath72 can be ascribed to properties of the single - particle orbits of the cranked nilsson mean field , _ i.e. _ , the routhian spectrum @xmath122 and single - particle alignments @xmath120 .    to clarify the relation of @xmath133 to the cranked nilsson single particle orbits , it is useful to introduce a quantity which represents density of the single - particle alignment as a function of routhian energy @xmath134 which is defined separately for neutrons(@xmath135 ) and protons(@xmath136 ) .",
    "here it is noted that the function @xmath137 in the r.h.s of eq.([thermal ] ) is a smooth function peaked at the fermi energy @xmath123 with width of order of temperature @xmath125 ( and normalized as @xmath138 ) .",
    "this allows us to regard the function @xmath139 as a smoothing function . introducing a smoothed density of the single - particle alignment by @xmath140 as a function of the fermi energy @xmath123",
    ", the dispersion @xmath132 of rotational frequency can be expressed in terms of the smoothed single - particle alignment , @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 represent the neutron and proton contributions to @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "they are plotted in fig.[smooth ] as functions of the fermi energy @xmath123 .",
    "the quantity @xmath145 ( and the alignment density @xmath146 ) shows oscillation as a function of the fermi energy with a typical period of 5 mev .",
    "maximum points of the oscillation are related to aligned high-@xmath79 or high-@xmath147 orbits .",
    "taking @xmath142 as an example , the maximum at @xmath148 mev is caused by the lowest and most aligned @xmath149 orbit ( @xmath150 ) and the second @xmath151 orbit ( which originate from @xmath152 ) , and the next peak at @xmath153 mev corresponds to @xmath154 ( and @xmath155 ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath142 takes locally minimum value at around @xmath156 mev , where there exist no highly aligned orbits , but instead present are the oblate orbits with high-@xmath157 value such as @xmath158\\frac{7}{2},[512]\\frac{5}{2},[505]\\frac{11}{2}$ ] which have little alignments ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the neutron fermi surface of superdeformed @xmath2hg(@xmath160 ) is located near the minimum point of the shell oscillation .",
    "the proton contribution @xmath143 also shows a similar shell oscillation , and the proton fermi surface of superdeformed @xmath2hg(@xmath161 ) is also situated near the minimum position of the shell oscillation . in fig.[smooth ] , the smoothed spectral density of single - particle routhians @xmath122 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath162 , is also plotted . from the comparison with @xmath163",
    ", it is seen that the shell oscillation of the alignment density is not directly related to the spectral density , but mainly reflects the single - particle alignments @xmath120 .",
    "one can easily expect that the maxima and minima of the alignment density ( dispersion of rotational frequency ) varies strongly as a function not only of the fermi energy but also of deformation and rotational frequency since the routhian energy of the strongly aligned orbits generally depends on these quantities .",
    "the non - linear spin dependence of @xmath133 seen in fig.[disp - spin ] is originated from the shell effect in the single - particle alignments .",
    "similar non - linear spin dependence due to aligned orbits was also recognized in the calculation of @xmath132 in normal deformed @xmath15yb @xcite .",
    "the dispersion @xmath144 of rotational frequency calculated as a function of quadrupole deformation parameter(fig.[disp - def ] ) also shows significant oscillation . in fig.[disp - def ] , we plot for comparison an analytic estimate @xcite of @xmath133 based on the harmonic potential model @xmath164,\\ ] ] which neglects the shell effects and therefore gives an average ( and smooth ) behavior .",
    "the comparison indicates that the shell effect of alignment is the same order of magnitude as the average value . in @xmath2hg",
    "the shell effect suppresses the dispersion of rotational frequency at the deformation ( and fermi surface ) of the superdeformed states .",
    "note that different situation is realized in superdeformed nuclei in @xmath165 region , where the fermi surface is located in the vicinity of the aligned high-@xmath147 orbits such as @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "this enhances @xmath133 in @xmath12eu as shown in fig.[disp - def ] .",
    "thus the shell structure in the single - particle alignment influences significantly the dispersion of rotational frequency @xmath133 , and consequently this causes very small rotational damping width @xmath72 in superdeformed @xmath2hg .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the mechanism for the very large number of rotational superdeformed bands(@xmath168 ) obtained in @xmath2hg .    in the preceding paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that the relatively large number of bands @xmath169 seen in the calculation for @xmath4 superdeformed nuclei(compared with the value @xmath170 for rare - earth normally deformed nuclei ) is due to the level density effect associated with the superdeformed shell gap in the single - particle routhian spectrum .",
    "this mechanism , however , does not account for the calculated results for @xmath2hg .    to show this ,",
    "let us repeat briefly the arguments for the level density effect @xcite . in that argument we assumed that the onset of rotational damping takes place",
    "as soon as the configuration mixing among basis @xmath28p-@xmath28h states becomes strong .",
    "the condition for configuration mixing may be expressed as @xmath171 in terms of the spreading width @xmath109 of the basis @xmath28p-@xmath28h states and the density @xmath172 of @xmath28p-@xmath28h states which can interact via the two - body interaction @xcite . assuming the fermi golden rule for the spreading width @xmath173 , the condition can be written also in terms of the average matrix element @xmath174 of the residual two - body interaction and the spacing @xmath175 between interactive states , @xmath176 if we assume the level density @xmath177 and two - body level density @xmath172 of @xmath28p-@xmath28h states follow the fermi gas formula @xcite",
    ", @xmath178 @xmath179 the onset energy of configuration mixing ( and rotational damping ) is expressed in terms of the level density parameter @xmath180 and the average matrix element @xmath174 as @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "similarly the number of rotational bands is expressed as @xmath182 , which is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath183 and hence of @xmath184 .",
    "the level density parameter @xmath180 is usually parameterized as @xmath185 where @xmath186 mev for normally deformed nuclei in the cranked nilsson model . for the superdeformed states , the level density is smaller than that of normally deformed states because of the shell gap in the single - particle routhian spectrum , and this can be represented by larger value of @xmath187 , which is estimated as @xmath188 mev for @xmath12eu and @xmath11dy , respectively @xcite . calculated level densities of superdeformed states for @xmath2hg is shown in fig.[density ] , from which @xmath189 mev is estimated .",
    "on the other hand , the average magnitude @xmath174 of the two - body elements @xmath190 is estimated as @xmath191 ( volume integral of the two - body force)/(nuclear volume ) @xmath192 .",
    "the r.m.s value of the calculated off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath193 is @xmath19420 , 18 , 12 and 16 kev for @xmath12eu , @xmath11dy , @xmath2hg , and normally deformed @xmath15yb .",
    "they approximately follow the expected @xmath195 dependence . using the above characterizations of the level density and the residual interaction , the dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath13 on the level density shell effect ( parameter @xmath187 ) and the mass number @xmath196",
    "is estimated as @xmath197 , and @xmath13 is an monotonically increasing function of @xmath187 and independent of @xmath196 .",
    "this argument predicts that @xmath13 in @xmath2hg would be smaller than those in @xmath11dy and @xmath12eu .",
    "it is noted , however , that microscopically calculated @xmath13 for superdeformed @xmath2hg is much larger than those for @xmath11dy and @xmath12eu ( fig.[number](a ) ) .",
    "this indicates that the excessively large number of superdeformed rotational bands in @xmath2hg can not be explained just by the shell effect in the level density .",
    "this is also demonstrated in fig.[reonset ] which    plots the microscopically calculated @xmath198 multiplied by a factor @xmath199 with which we intend to remove the level density shell effect .",
    "it is seen that the scaled onset energy in @xmath2hg is higher than that for @xmath12eu , @xmath11dy and @xmath15yb .",
    "if we assume the above argument the onset energy of configuration mixing is estimated as @xmath200 mev for @xmath2hg with use of the scaling property @xmath201 and @xmath202 kev and @xmath203 mev @xcite for normally deformed @xmath15yb whereas the microscopically calculated onset energy of rotational damping is about 1.6 mev .",
    "the above analysis indicates that the onset of rotational damping in @xmath2hg takes place at higher excitation energy ( @xmath204 mev ) than onset energy ( @xmath205 mev ) of configuration mixing of @xmath28p-@xmath28h states .",
    "namely , the onset of rotational damping is slightly `` retarded '' in comparison with the onset of mixing .",
    "this indicates that the mechanism of the onset of rotational damping is qualitatively different from those in the normal deformed rare - earth nuclei and @xmath206 superdeformed nuclei .    to understand the mechanism of onset of rotational damping in @xmath2hg , it is useful to recall the argument @xcite that discusses possible occurrence of ergodic rotational bands which means rotational band structures formed by compound intrinsic states ( the states whose wave functions have strong configuration mixing ) .",
    "the ergodic rotational bands are expected to realize when the rotational damping width is smaller than the level spacing @xmath207 of the all levels at fixed @xmath55 , @xmath208 while wave functions of the energy levels are compound mixture of basis many - particle many - hole states . in this situation",
    ", a compound state at spin @xmath48 decays by e2 transition to a single final compound state at @xmath50 , and hence sequence of such e2 transitions forms a band structure in spite of the strong mixing .    in the calculated situation for @xmath2hg ,",
    "many of the excessive number of rotational bands reside in the energy region between @xmath209 mev ( the estimated onset energy of mixing , see above ) and @xmath210 mev ( the onset energy of rotational damping ) .",
    "many of the energy levels in this energy region are some mixture of basis many - particle many - hole configurations although they are not fully ergodic since their excitation energy is just a few hundred kev above the onset energy of configuration mixing @xcite . the rotational damping width @xmath72 in @xmath2 hg is evaluated to be 20 - 30 kev for spins @xmath211(fig.[width2 ] ) .",
    "the total level spacing @xmath212 is @xmath213 kev at @xmath214 mev , and @xmath215 kev at @xmath216 mev ( estimated from fig.[density](a ) ) .",
    "namely , the rotational damping width is comparable with the level spacing , @xmath217 in the energy region under discussion .",
    "thus , the situation lies around the borderline of the condition eq.([ergodic2 ] ) for the ergodic rotational bands .",
    "this suggests that similar mechanism to that of the ergodic rotational bands is taking place in superdeformed @xmath2hg , and explains why the energy levels in the region of @xmath218 mev form rotational band structures and contribute to the large number of @xmath13 .",
    "the above argument explains also the observation that @xmath219 in @xmath2hg decreases as spin increases , especially for @xmath220 , since @xmath72 becomes as large as @xmath221 kev for @xmath222 , which tends to violate the relation eq.([rot - den ] ) .",
    "note that the above mechanism does not manifest itself in normally deformed @xmath15yb and superdeformed @xmath12eu where @xmath72 is much larger . for superdeformed @xmath11dy",
    ", the mechanism may be relevant to explain the small spin dependence of @xmath13 seen in fig.[number](b ) although the effect is not very significant ( cf ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it should be recalled here that the shell effect associated with the single - particle alignment plays an important role in causing such small @xmath72 particularly in superdeformed @xmath2hg , but not in other calculated nuclei , as we discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "we performed microscopic description of the rotational damping associated with superdeformed states in @xmath2hg .",
    "we obtained remarkably large number of superdeformed rotational bands , @xmath104 and very small rotational damping width @xmath223 kev , which are different by more than factor 2 from those in @xmath4 superdeformed nuclei and rare - earth normally deformed nuclei .",
    "it is also found that the rotational damping width varies in different nuclei in the @xmath4 region .",
    "the strong variation of the rotational damping width is attributed to the shell structure associated with the angular momentum alignment of the single - particle orbits in the cranked nilsson potential .",
    "the alignments of the excited many - particle many - hole configurations have different values for different states .",
    "their dispersion , which is strongly related to the rotational damping width , depends on the presence of highly aligned orbits in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "we pointed out that in superdeformed @xmath2hg the very small rotational damping width due to the shell effect causes slightly different mechanism for the onset of rotational damping . in the cases of the rare - earth",
    "normally deformed nuclei and @xmath4 superdeformed nuclei , the onset of rotational damping takes place at the same energy as the onset energy of configuration mixing among @xmath28p-@xmath28h states . in @xmath2hg , on the other hand , energy levels in the onset region of configuration mixing do not necessarily accompany damped rotational decay since the damping width is as small as the level spacing of the final states .",
    "this leads to the significantly large number of superdeformed rotational bands in @xmath2hg .    summarizing the present investigations together with those in the preceding paper @xcite , we revealed two kinds of shell effects which affect properties of the rotational damping associated with superdeformed states .",
    "firstly , because of the shell gap in the single - particle spectrum of the rotating superdeformed mean field , the level density of excited superdeformed states is relatively low and the configuration mixing is weak compared with normally deformed nuclei .",
    "this influences onset properties of the rotational damping as demonstrated by the calculations for @xmath4 region @xcite .",
    "the second one , which was discussed in the present paper , is originated from the shell structure in the angular momentum alignments of the single - particle orbits .",
    "it affects strongly the damping width of rotational damping , but also modifies the onset properties of the damping under certain conditions as seen in @xmath2hg .",
