    "recent cosmological observations from supernovae ia ( perlmutter et al . 1999 ; riess et al . , 1998 ) , cosmic microwave background radiation ( spergel et al . , 2003 ; komatsu et al . , 2009 ; komatsu et al . , 2010",
    ") , large scale structure ( tegmark et al . , 2004 ; seljak et al . ,",
    "2005 ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( eisenstein et al . , 2005 ) and weak lensing ( jain @xmath2 taylor , 2003 ) have revealed that our universe is in accelerated expansion phase and it began this acceleration at the near past . in order to explain the late time cosmic acceleration one can use dark energy or dark gravity approaches . in the dark gravity approach , one modifies the left - hand side of the einstein equation to obtain a modified gravity theory . the simplest model of this category is the well - known @xmath3 gravity in which the ricci scalar in the einstein - hilbert action replaces by a general function of the ricci scalar ( nojiri @xmath2 odintsov , 2006 ; de felice @xmath2 tsujikawa , 2010 ; sotiriou @xmath2 faraoni , 2010 ) . in the second approach",
    "we introduce an exotic energy component with negative pressure called dark energy in the right - hand side of the einstein equation in the frame work of general relativity ( for a review see ( copeland et al . , 2006 ) ) .",
    "+ the simplest candidate of dark energy is a tiny positive time - independent cosmological constant @xmath4 with the equation of state @xmath5 ( weinberg , 1989 ; sahi @xmath2 starobinsky , 2000 ; peebles @xmath2 ratra , 2003 ; padmanabhan , 2003 ) .",
    "however , it suffers from two serious theoretical problems , i.e. , the cosmological constant problem ( why @xmath4 is about 120 orders of magnitude smaller than its natural expectation value ? ) and the coincidence problem ( why are we living in an epoch in which the dark energy density and the dust matter energy are comparable ? ) . as a solution of these problems various dynamical dark energy models have been proposed .",
    "the dynamical nature of dark energy can originate from various scalar fields such as quintessence ( wetterich , 1988 ; ratra @xmath2 peebles , 1988 ; caldwell et al . , 1998 ) ,",
    "phantom ( a scalar field with negative kinetic energy ) and also tachyon scalar field ( alexander , 2002 ; mazumdar et al .",
    ", 2001 ; gibbons , 2002 ; garousi et al . , 2005 ; copeland et al . , 2005 ;",
    "sen , 1999 ; bergshoeff et al . , 2000 ; kluson , 2000 ) .",
    "holographic dark energy is another proposal for dynamical dark energy models ( setare , 2007a , b , c ) .",
    "+ for a single minimally coupled scalar field model , it has been shown that the effective equation of state can not cross the phantom divide line ( @xmath5 ) confirmed by cosmic observations ( zhao et al . , 2005 ; caldwell @xmath2 doran , 2005 ; hu , 2005 ; feng et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , it is shown in ( vikman , 2005 ) that the transition from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ( or vice versa ) of dark energy described by general scalar field lagrangian @xmath8 is impossible . thus in order to explain the transition under the minimal assumptions of the non - kinetic interaction of dark energy and other matter one should suppose that the dark energy was subdominating and described by a nonlinear in @xmath9 lagrangian .",
    "so , some nonlinear ( or probably quantum ) physics must be invoked to explain the value @xmath7 in models with one scalar field .",
    "also , the models with a combination of phantom and quintessence called quintom have been proposed ( feng et al . , 2005 ; elizalde et al . , 2004 ; guo et al . , 2005",

    ", 2009 ) ( for a detailed review , see ( padmanabhan , 2003 ) ) .",
    "+ furthermore , the teleparallel equivalent of the einstein general relativity ( einstein , 1928 ; hayashi @xmath2 shirafuji , 1979 ) is an equivalent formulation of classical gravity where one uses the weitzenbock connection , which has no curvature but torsion , rather than the torsionless levi - civita connection .",
    "the dynamical objects in this formulation are four linearly independent vierbeins .",
    "the advantage of this framework is that the torsion is formed solely from products of first derivative of the tetrad .",
    "+ recently , following the @xmath3 modified gravity , generalizations of teleparallel gravity have been proposed in refs .",

    "the interesting feature of @xmath10 theories is that their equations are second order in derivatives and therefore , they can use to account for the accelerated expansion of the universe and remain free of pathologies . + a number of attempts in studying @xmath10 gravity are as follows : finite - time future singularities in @xmath10 gravity models have been considered in ( setare @xmath2 houndjo , 2012 ) .",
    "the cosmological perturbations in such a theory have been investigated in ( dent et al .",
    ", 2010 ; zheng @xmath2 huang , 2010 ) and local lorentz invariance in this context has been examined in ( sotiriou et al . , 2010 ; li et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "+ very recently the teleparallel dark energy in which a usual scalar field in the action of teleparallel gravity is responsible for dark energy , has been proposed in ( geng et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "geng et al .",
    "have considered quintessence as dark energy component and showed that such a scenario is completely equivalent to the standard quintessence if scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "motivated by the similar one in the framework of general relativity , they have also investigated the case that the scalar field non - minimally coupled to the torsion scalar in the framework of teleparallel gravity .",
    "they have found that such a theory has a richer structure than the same one in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the richer structure of non - minimally coupled quintessence with torsion gravity is due to exhibiting quintessence - like or phantom - like behavior , or experiencing the phantom divide crossing in this theory .",
    "+ in this paper we are interested in teleparallel dark energy where instead of quintessence one uses the tachyon scalar field . the tachyon field in the world volume theory of the open string stretched between a d - brane and an anti - d - brane or a non - bps d - brane plays the role of scalar field in the context of string theory ( alexander , 2002 ; mazumdar et al . , 2001 ; gibbons , 2002 )",
    "what distinguishes the tachyon lagrangian from the standard klein - gordan form for scalar field is that the tachyon action has a non - standard type namely , dirac - born - infeld form ( garousi et al . , 2005 ; copeland et al . , 2005 ; sen , 1999 ; bergshoeff et al . , 2000 ; kluson , 2000 ) .",
    "+ an outline of the present work is as follows : in section 2 we introduce tachyonic teleparallel dark energy model in which tachyon field plays the role of scalar field and the non - minimal coupling between scalar field and torsion scalar is also present in the action .",
    "then , we derive the field equations as well as the energy density and pressure in order to study the cosmological behavior of the model . we obtain the conditions required for phantom divide crossing of our model in section 3 and then we show that such a crossing can be satisfied numerically .",
    "section 4 is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "in this section let us first briefly review the key ingredients of teleparallel gravity . to this end",
    "we follow the refs .",
    "( einstein , 1928 ; hayashi @xmath2 shirafuji , 1979 ; bengochea @xmath2 ferraro , 2009 ; wu @xmath2 yu , 2010a , b ; linder , 2010 ; wu @xmath2 yu , 2011 ) . in the teleparallelism ,",
    "orthonormal tetrad components @xmath12 are used , where an index @xmath13 runs over @xmath14 for the tangent space at each point @xmath15 of the manifold .",
    "their relation to the metric @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are coordinate indices on the manifold , also running over @xmath14 .",
    "instead of the ricci scalar @xmath0 for the lagrangian density in general relativity , the teleparallel lagrangian density is described by the torsion scalar @xmath1 , defined as @xmath20 where the torsion @xmath21 , contorsion @xmath22 and @xmath23 , defined as @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 in summary , the relevant action of teleparallel gravity is @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 while @xmath30 is a bare gravitational constant and @xmath31 is a reduced planck mass .",
    "since the above action can not lead to an accelerated universe , one has to generalize the action ( 6 ) by using the following two approaches : the first is to replace @xmath1 by a general function @xmath10 ( geng et al . , 2011 ; unzicker @xmath2 case , 2005 ; chattopadhyay @xmath2 debnath , 2011 ; sharif @xmath2 rani , 2011 ; wei et al . , 2011 ) in analogy to @xmath3 extension of general relativity .",
    "the second way is to add a scalar field responsible for dark energy in action ( 6 ) , allowing a non - minimal coupling between it and gravity .",
    "we focus on the second approach and utilize the tachyon scalar field as dark energy . +",
    "our starting action is as follows , @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is an arbitrary function of tachyon scalar field and it is responsible for non - minimal coupling between tachyon and gravity .",
    "the last term in the above action is the born - infeld type action for tachyon field , where @xmath34 is the tachyonic potential which is bounded and reaching its minimum asymptotically .",
    "similar to the standard non - minimal tachyon in general relativity where the scalar field couples to the ricci scalar , in here the non - minimal coupling will be between the torsion and the scalar field .",
    "+ in refs .",
    "( cai et al . , 2007b ; sadeghi et al . , 2008 ) the authors have been added an extra higher derivative term @xmath35 in the square root part of the tachyonic lagrangian and showed that crossing of the phantom divide occurs before reaching the tachyon potential asymptotically to its minimum .",
    "+ considering a spatially - flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , @xmath36 and a vierbein choice of the form @xmath37 and a homogeneous scalar field @xmath38 , the corresponding friedmann equations are given by , @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the hubble parameter , @xmath42 is the scale factor , a dot stands for the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the matter energy density and pressure respectively , satisfying the equation @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the matter equation of state parameter .",
    "the effective energy density and pressure of tachyonic teleparallel dark energy are given by , @xmath48 and @xmath49 where a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "note that for a frw universe it is easy to find @xmath50 .",
    "+ the equation of motion of the scalar field in frw background ( 8) reads @xmath51 in fact the above relation expresses the energy conservation equation @xmath52 from equation ( 13 ) one can obtain the following useful relation for the hubble parameter @xmath53 , @xmath54.\\ ] ] next , we are going to explore the effects of non - minimal teleparallel dark energy on the cosmological evolution of equation of state ( eos ) and see how the present model can be used to realize a crossing of phantom divide @xmath5 for two possible roots of @xmath53 .",
    "let us proceed in studying cosmological implications of the present model . for doing so",
    ", we begin with the eos of teleparallel dark energy @xmath55 and assume that the matter content of the univers to be dust matter @xmath56 .",
    "now one derives the following relation using ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , @xmath57 when @xmath58 goes to @xmath59 the above expression should be zero because we have @xmath60 .",
    "so , to fulfilled such a requirement , one leads to the condition , @xmath61 moreover , in order to @xmath58 crosses the phantom divide line , we have to check @xmath62 at the crossing point , @xmath63 @xmath64.\\ ] ] next , putting the condition ( 17 ) into ( 18 ) , yields to @xmath65\\ ] ] @xmath66.\\ ] ] now , the condition ( 17 ) tell us that a necessary condition to obtain phantom divide crossing is @xmath67 .",
    "we remark that the condition ( 17 ) is a necessary condition and not enough condition for crossing over @xmath59 , but one immediately concludes from ( 19 ) , if @xmath67 then ( 19 ) will be non - zero and the enough condition fulfilled . in order to show that non - minimal tachyonic teleparallel dark energy can indeed realized the phantom divide crossing more",
    "transparently we solve the cosmological system numerically using specific examples for coupling function @xmath33 and tachyonic potential @xmath34 .",
    "+ in figure 1 , we have plotted the evolution of equation of state parameter for two kinds of tachyonic potentials , i.e. exponential potential @xmath68 and inverse square potential @xmath69 , and for positive sign in expression ( 15 ) .",
    "we mention that in the numerical calculations we have considered the non - minimal coupling function to be @xmath70 .",
    "such a non - minimal coupling function is the same as that considered in ( geng et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "these plots clearly show that crossing of the phantom divide line can be realized from a non - phantom phase @xmath71 to a phantom phase @xmath72 in non - minimal tachyonic teleparallel dark energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that a crossing from @xmath71 to @xmath72 is consistent with the recent cosmological observational data ( alam et al . , 2004 ; nesseris @xmath2 perivolaropoulos , 2007 ; wu @xmath2 yu , 2006 ; alam et al . , 2007 ; jassal et al . , 2010 ) and",
    "also such a crossing is in agreement with that in the context of @xmath10 gravity models ( bamba et al . ,",
    "2011 ) but in contrast with the viable @xmath3 gravity models where the phantom divide line is crossed the other way around ( bamba et al .",
    ", 2010a , b ) . in figure 2",
    ", we have depicted the @xmath73-evolution for the same choices as in figure 1 but for minus sign in ( 15 ) .",
    "one can see that in this case the crossing of @xmath59 can not be happen for @xmath69 and for exponential potential such a crossing is from phantom phase to the non - phantom one .",
    "so , by considering the above discussion it seems that the exponential potential is a better choice in studying the phantom divide crossing cosmology in the context of non - minimal teleparallel tachyonic dark energy .",
    "the teleparallel dark energy scenario ( geng et al . , 2011 ) is based on the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity . in such a model one utilizes a scalar field , in which the dark energy sector is attributed , allowing also for a non - minimal coupling between the field and the torsion scalar .",
    "we have proposed thachyonic teleparallel dark energy model where tachyon field played the role of scalar field .",
    "a remarkable feature of the our model is that it realizes the phantom divide line crossing , a cosmologically observed phenomena ( alam et al . , 2004 ; nesseris @xmath2 perivolaropoulos , 2007 ; wu @xmath2 yu , 2006 ; alam et al . , 2007 ; jassal et al . , 2010 )",
    "by studying the evolutionary curves of @xmath58 for exponential and inverse square tachyonic potential , we found that @xmath58 can cross the @xmath59 line as it was shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "furthermore , we also found that at the crossing point the time derivative of tachyon field , @xmath74 should be non - zero in order to @xmath58 crosses over @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , considering the positive sign in equation ( 15 ) leads to a crossing from non - phantom phase to the phantom phase for both exponential and inverse square tachyonic potentials and such a behavior is consistent with the observational data ( alam et al . , 2004 ;",
    "nesseris @xmath2 perivolaropoulos , 2007 ; wu @xmath2 yu , 2006 ; alam et al .",
    ", 2007 ; jassal et al . , 2010 ) . in the other side",
    "taking the negative sign in ( 15 ) and exponential form for tachyon potential result in phantom divide crossing similar to that in viable @xmath3 models i.e from @xmath72 to @xmath75 , while for inverse square potential the @xmath76 crossing does not occur .",
    "+ in summary , the model ( 7 ) has the property of crossing the cosmological constant boundary , only with single tachyon field which is coupled non - minimally with torsion gravity .",
