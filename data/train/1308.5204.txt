    "there has been a renewed interest in perturbative quantum gravity in part due to recent developments illuminating a relationship between gravity and gauge theory amplitudes @xcite and also because of its relevance in high energy , small angle scattering @xcite .",
    "the long distance regime of this theory is particularly interesting as quantum gravity has a simpler infrared structure than gauge theories .",
    "for instance , there is a cancellation of collinear divergences in the former theory but not the latter @xcite and the logarithmically divergent soft amplitudes have a ladder like structure .    since the infrared behavior of perturbative quantum gravity is tractable , it is important to look for observables for which long distance effects are particularly important .",
    "a fundamentally infrared dominated physical quantity of note in perturbative quantum gravity is the eikonal phase that has been calculated for small - angle high - energy scattering processes .",
    "an eloquent overview of the eikonal regime for this type of scattering is given in a set of lectures by giddings @xcite .",
    "this process has been shown to be largely independent of short distance physics .",
    "giddings , gross and maharana @xcite argued that the scattering of strings may be replaced by graviton contributions alone with short distance physics playing no significant role . as reviewed in @xcite the leading eikonal approximation is justified for high energy , small angle scattering of equal - mass particles , because the impact parameter as determined from the saddle point of the loop integrations is larger than the typical gravitational radius @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "thus non - local string effects are actually subdominant to higher loop gravitational processes for a large range of impact parameters . in a slightly different kinematic regime , to be discussed later , we find the first subleading contributions coming from field theory corrections to the eikonal phase .",
    "the eikonal approximation provides the leading contribution , which exponentiates in impact parameter space .",
    "large impact parameters dominate the scattering in this regime .",
    "the next - to - eikonal contribution to small - angle high - energy gravitational scattering has to our knowledge not previously been calculated , although there has been much interesting progress on this topic for non - abelian gauge theories @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the effective vertices at the next - to - eikonal level for gravity are given .",
    "our specific calculations will also make contact with the extensive computations of ref .",
    "a number of our results will involve special limits of the diagrammatic calculations outlined there . in this paper , we consider the near forward scattering of unequal - mass scalar particles , and compute power corrections to the eikonal approximation in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the momentum transfer and @xmath4 the energy of a light projectile that undergoes small - angle scattering by a heavy target , nearly at rest .",
    "we will find potentially substantial corrections , linear in this ratio , associated with both the next - to - eikonal expansion and , at the same level , corrections due to the nonlinear gravitational interactions .    in section [ seceik ] we will review the calculation for the leading eikonal phase to establish our conventions .",
    "we proceed to calculating the next - to - eikonal phase in section [ noneik ] .",
    "this is done by expanding the scalar propagator to next - to - eikonal order as well as allowing seagull type vertices in the diagram .",
    "we find that part of this contribution exponentiates , and calculate the correction to the saddlepoint at this order .",
    "we conclude with a summary and brief discussion of our results .",
    "certain technical calculations are relegated to an appendix .",
    "it was shown by ",
    "t hooft @xcite that the scattering of ultrarelativistic particles could be reliably studied by considering graviton exchange in perturbative quantum gravity . in the rest frame of one of the particles , the gravitational field of the rapidly moving particle",
    "is that of a gravitational shock wave , which can be described by the aichelburg - sexl metric @xcite . the particle at rest is a quantum particle whose dynamics",
    "can be described by the solutions of klein - gordon equation in the aichelburg - sexl background . this was ",
    "t hooft s approach @xcite and the results can also be obtained by summing a class of feynman diagrams in the eikonal approximation @xcite . in this section",
    "we will demonstrate how this latter approach can be extended to the next - to - eikonal level .",
    "we will investigate the small - angle gravitational scattering of an ultra - relativistic light scalar particle of energy @xmath5 off of a very heavy scalar particle .",
    "the mass of the heavy particle , @xmath6 , is bigger than @xmath5 and both are much larger than the transferred momentum .",
    "this approximation is made not only because it simplifies the calculations needed to determine the next - to - eikonal corrections .",
    "it will also lead to power corrections of the form @xmath2 , which in terms of invariants is @xmath7 , much larger than the corrections that characterize the scattering of equal - mass particles .",
    "we first show the exponentiation of the amplitude in the leading eikonal approximation in the kinematic regime described above .",
    "then we consider the next - to - leading eikonal corrections . to make our kinematics explicit , throughout this paper we will be working in the large center of mass energy and small angle scattering regime for the scattering , @xmath8 so we will take the incoming and outgoing momentum @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the light scalar particle @xmath11 to be much larger than the momentum transfer between the two scalars , @xmath12",
    ". we will take @xmath13 and @xmath14 to be the incoming and outgoing momenta of the heavy scalar @xmath15 .",
    "we will also work in the frame where @xmath16 and in the de donder gauge .",
    "we will always work to leading power in @xmath17 , and seek the first power corrections in @xmath4 .",
    "let us first consider this process in the eikonal limit to establish our conventions .",
    "in this limit it is well known that only the ladder and crossed - ladder type diagrams contribute .",
    "it will be instructive to consider the cases where one and two gravitons are exchanged between the scalars before moving to the general @xmath18-graviton case .",
    "let us first work with the simplest case where only a single graviton is exchanged ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the matrix element corresponding to this diagram can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the numerator of the de donder gauge graviton propagator , @xmath21 is the scalar - scalar - graviton vertex , and @xmath22 .",
    "we will use the fact that in the large @xmath17 limit @xmath23 to leading power in @xmath17 , the right hand side of is independent of the momentum flowing through the vertex so we will always be free to use this identity for any vertex on a heavy line .    in the ultra - relativistic limit @xmath24 and @xmath25 so ,",
    "@xmath26 corrections are down by two powers of @xmath4 .",

    "we emphasize that the terms we have ignored at leading eikonal order in and are suppressed either by a factor of @xmath17 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "thus , when we consider the @xmath29 next - to - eikonal contribution in the following discussion , we will not need to consider corrections arising from such numerator factors .",

    "the inverse fourier transform back to momentum space is dominated by the stationary phase point at @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the schwarzschild radius of the heavy particle and @xmath65 .",
    "thus in the ultrarelativistic regime of small momentum transfer , this process is dominated by impact parameters larger than the schwarzschild radius of the target particle .",
    "we note , however , that because of the asymmetry between the masses of the two scalar particles , the point of stationary phase of the inverse transform occurs at a multiple of the schwarzschild radius that is set by the ratio of the momentum transfer to the energy , not to the heavy particle mass .",
    "therefore , at small but finite angles , the scattering is dominated by impact parameters of order @xmath64 divided by the scattering angle , rather than by the ratio of the momentum transfer divided by the total center of mass energy .",
    "in this situation , non - linear gravitational effects and corrections to the eikonal approximation are of comparable size .",
    "we will return the transformation to impact parameter below , when interpreting next - to - eikonal corrections , neglecting any contributions that are concentrated at @xmath66 .",

    "while the leading order term shows that the impact parameter differs from the schwarzschild radius of the heavy particle by a large factor of @xmath174 , no such enhancement is present for the correction .",
    "thus as expected , the leading order result suggests that the scattering process is dominated by large values of the impact parameter for near - forward scattering .",
    "nevertheless , the power correction to the leading eikonal result shifts by a finite factor times the schwarzschild radius .",
    "corrections are proportional to the ratio of momentum transfer to projectile energy , and are independent of the heavy particle mass .",
    "this suggests that for the system under study , small angle scattering is a transition region , where corrections to eikonal propagation and gravitational self - interactions are of comparable sizes . in this light",
    "it may be interesting to look at yet higher powers in the our expansion about the eikonal approximation .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the next - to - eikonal contribution to the gravitational scattering amplitude for the near - forward scattering of a light scalar by a much heavier scalar particle .",
    "working at leading power in the heavy particle mass , we expanded the light particle propagator to next - to - eikonal power and included gravitational interactions of comparable size , finding power corrections suppressed by a single power of @xmath175 with respect to the leading eikonal term .",
    "corrections are pure phases , leaving leading - power exponentiation unaffected , and are consistent with the exponentiation of the power corrections themselves .",
    "the next - to - eikonal and gravitational corrections cause the saddle point of the impact parameter to shift in magnitude by an amount comparable to the schwarzschild radius of the heavy particle .",
    "our calculations are of relevance for the small angle scattering of a light particle from a black hole .",
    "the power corrections we find are potentially bigger than in the case of scattering of equal mass particles .",
