    "to investigate the predictions of heat equation it is often necessary to approximate its solution numerically@xcite . discrete exterior calculus ( dec )",
    "constitutes a discrete realization of the exterior differential forms structure , and therefore , the right framework in which to develop a discretization of exterior differential system@xcite .",
    "the operators in this system such as hodge star , exterior derivative , and laplace operator can also be naturally discretized by dec .",
    "the techniques of dec can be used to construct a conditional stable scheme for heat equation@xcite .",
    "the stable condition is a very severe restriction , and implies that very many time steps will be necessary to follow the solution over a reasonably large time interval .    in this paper",
    "we shall propose two unconditional stable schemes for the numerical solution of heat equation in space manifold and the time , namely implicit and semi - implicit dec schemes .",
    "the analysis of their error is accomplished by the use of maximum principle .",
    "the methods proposed here can be extended to problems with general boundary condition as explicit scheme , then to general linear and nonlinear parabolic equations .",
    "for a function @xmath0 of three spatial variables @xmath1 and the time variable @xmath2 , the heat equation is @xmath3 with boundary conditions where @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath5 is the material density , @xmath6 is the material specific heat , @xmath7 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath8 is the internal heat source density .",
    "the dec method can approximate laplace operator as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the matrix of discrete exterior derivative , @xmath11 is the matrix of discrete hodge star operator .",
    "the explicit dec scheme for heat equation uses the forward time difference for the temporal derivative of eq.(1 ) , which is conditional stable@xcite .",
    "if we need to refine the space mesh to improve the accuracy of the solution the amount of work involved increases very rapidly , since we shall also reduce the length of time step .",
    "now , we show how the use of a backward time difference gives a difference scheme which avoids this restriction .    given @xmath12d or @xmath13d space manifold with a smooth boundary ,",
    "a simplicial mesh is a tessellation of it by triangular or tetrahedra , satisfies the condition that any two of them may intersect along a common face , edge or vertice .",
    "for some situations , a source having azimuthal symmetry about its axis is considered . in this case , we only need to consider 2d triangular discrete manifold as the space .",
    "the 3d case can also be done in the same way .    at first",
    ", we define some values on mesh . take fig.1 as an example for 2d mesh , in which @xmath14 , @xmath15 , ... , @xmath16 are vertices , @xmath17 , @xmath12, ... ,@xmath18 are the circumcenters of triangles , @xmath19 , @xmath20, ... ,@xmath21 are the circumcenters of edges .",
    "denote @xmath22 as the length of line segment @xmath23 and @xmath24 as the area of triangle @xmath25 .",

    ", the relation between @xmath31 and @xmath33 can be induced from scheme ( 2 ) as follows : @xmath34 if we introduce the maximum perturbation at @xmath35 time step by writing @xmath36 we can obtain @xmath37 inequality ( 3 ) holds for all vertices in grid , therefore @xmath38 that is to say scheme ( 2 ) is unconditional stability .",
    "longer time step can be used than in explicit dec scheme .    by the definition of truncation error",
    ", the solution @xmath39 of eq.(1 ) satisfies the same relation as scheme ( 2 ) except for an additional term @xmath40 on the right hand side .",
    "thus the error @xmath41 is determined from the relation @xmath42 define @xmath43 it follows that @xmath44 and hence that @xmath45 so that , since @xmath46 , @xmath47 and this tends to @xmath14 along the refinement path under the assumed hypotheses .",
    "so far we have assumed that numerical errors arise from the truncation errors of the finite difference approximations , but that the boundary values are used exactly .",
    "implicit dec scheme is not so easy to use as the explicit dec scheme .",
    "we must solve a system of equations to give the values simultaneously , which will cost a lot of time .",
    "now we propose a semi - implicit scheme , which combines the virtues of explicit scheme ( direct calculation ) and implicit scheme ( unconditional stability ) .",
    "this scheme is that the calculated element using next point of time whereas the other elements using current point of time .",
    "hence the semi - implicit scheme of eq.(1 ) is @xmath48 it can be rewritten as @xmath49    now , we consider the stability and convergence for scheme ( 4 ) .",
    "the relation between perturbation @xmath31 and @xmath33 can be induced from scheme ( 4 ) as follows : @xmath50 since the coefficients are positive , we can omit the modulus signs in the eq.(5 ) to give inequality @xmath51 inequality ( 6 ) holds for all vertices in mesh , therefore @xmath38 that is to say scheme(5 ) is unconditional stability .",
    "the relation of error @xmath52 can derived form scheme ( 4 ) as follows : @xmath53 because of the nonnegative coefficients , it follows that @xmath54 and hence that @xmath45 so that , since @xmath46 , @xmath47 and this tends to @xmath14 along the refinement path under the assumed hypotheses . that is to say scheme ( 5 ) is convergence .    in scheme",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , the derivative is approximated by first order difference .",
    "equivalently , @xmath4 is approximated by linear interpolation functions .",
    "consulting the definition about accuracy of finite volume method , we can also say that scheme ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) have first order temporal and spacial accuracy .",
    "the implementation of semi - implicit scheme ( 4 ) for heat equation is the same as the explicit scheme consisting of the following steps :    * set the simulation parameters .",
