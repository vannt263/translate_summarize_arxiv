    "the low - energy electric dipole strength in neutron - rich nuclei , commonly termed pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) , is currently a topic of great interest @xcite .",
    "it occurs at energies well below the isovector giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) and exhausts a considerable fraction ( up to about 10% ) of the total e1 strength in nuclei with a large neutron - to - proton ratio @xcite .",
    "the properties of the mode are claimed to provide insight into the formation of a neutron skin @xcite , although this is questioned @xcite .",
    "it may also constrain the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "thus , investigations of the pdr will be an important topic at future rare isotope beam facilities .",
    "furthermore , dipole strength in the vicinity of the neutron threshold may lead to significant changes of neutron - capture rates in the astrophysical @xmath7-process @xcite .",
    "originally considered to be a single - particle effect @xcite , many microscopic models nowadays favor an explanation of the pdr as an oscillation of a neutron skin - emerging with an increasing @xmath8 ratio - against an approximately isospin - saturated core .",
    "this conclusion is based on the analysis of theoretical transition densities which differ significantly from those in the gdr region .",
    "however , at least for stable nuclei with a moderate neutron excess this question is far from being settled , see e.g.  the recent work of ref .",
    "quantitative predictions of the centroid energy and strength of the pdr as well as the corresponding collectivity as a function of neutron excess differ considerably .",
    "this is due partly to the properties of the underlying mean - field description ( e.g. , skyrme - type or relativistic models ) but also results partly from the difficulty to separate clearly the location of pdr and gdr .",
    "e1 strength distributions at low excitation energies are also strongly modified when complex configurations beyond the 1 particle - 1 hole ( 1p1h ) level are included in the models ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "data on the low - energy e1 strength in very neutron - rich heavy nuclei are scarce @xcite .",
    "although the pdr strength is much weaker in stable nuclei , detailed spectroscopy with different isovector @xcite and isoscalar @xcite probes provides important insight into a possible interpretation of the mode as a neutron - skin oscillation , the interplay of collectivity and single - particle degrees of freedom and its isospin nature @xcite .",
    "extensive studies have been performed in stable even - mass nuclides utilizing the @xmath9 reaction , in particular at shell closures . however , the connection of these results to the pdr in nuclei with very large @xmath8 ratios is not clear @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 experiments are selective towards ground - state ( g.s . )",

    "possible branching ratios to excited states are often neglected , but statistical model calculations of the branching ratios suggest potentially large corrections of the deduced e1 strength @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty has an impact on the determination of the e1 polarizability , which has been established as a measure of the neutron skin and the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite .    in a benchmark experiment on the doubly magic nucleus @xmath16pb @xcite ,",
    "relativistic coulomb excitation in proton scattering at energies of a few hundred mev and very forward angles has been established as a new promising approach to study the complete e1 strength in nuclei @xcite .",

    "the new experimental results presented here show that the major part of the e1 strength distribution in @xmath0sn up to neutron threshold is missed in the @xmath9 experiment indepedent from possible corrections due to decays to excited states .",
    "the experiments were performed at the grand raiden spectrometer of the research center of nuclear physics in osaka using a 295  mev polarized proton beam at spectrometer angles @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the detector setup and the principles of the raw - data analysis are described in ref .",
