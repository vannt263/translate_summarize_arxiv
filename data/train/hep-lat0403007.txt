    "the first generation of qcd simulations using wilson fermions have provided useful information on the hadron spectrum but have been restricted to relatively heavy quark masses ( see for example the annual reviews by aoki  @xcite and kaneko  @xcite ) . using an improved staggered discretisation ,",
    "the milc collaboration  @xcite has probed the spectrum with significantly lighter quark masses and very promising results are now being obtained  @xcite from simulations with light quark masses down to @xmath2 , a physical strange quark mass @xmath3 and lattice spacings down to @xmath4  fm .",
    "there are theoretical and numerical complications associated with this action and the representation of lattice flavour symmetries and so simulations with wilson fermions remain an important tool in studying full qcd . in due course , simulations with chiral fermions should become feasible and provide a further cross - check on the results now being obtained .    in an earlier paper  @xcite the ukqcd collaboration",
    "has presented lattice qcd results based on two - flavour simulations conducted at fixed lattice spacing ( @xmath5 fm ) and fixed volume around @xmath6 .",
    "this work also contained results obtained at fixed gauge coupling ( @xmath7 ) also using the standard wilson gauge action and @xmath8improved wilson fermions .",
    "the lightest sea quark mass achieved in these simulations was around @xmath9 of the strange quark mass ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "there is evidence that some hadronic observables suffer finite size effects already on these lattice volumes  @xcite .",
    "working at lighter quark masses at fixed gauge coupling is expected to enhance further these effects and to provide an even greater challenge to the standard monte carlo simulation algorithms . in this paper",
    ", we report on the results of an attempt to push our analysis towards this lighter quark regime in order to ( a ) uncover any more obvious effects of dynamical fermions not hitherto seen with this action  @xcite and ( b ) determine the limits if any of the simulation algorithm in its simplest form .",
    "a previous study  @xcite had indicated a potential instability at light quark masses when using step sizes that were too large in the molecular dynamics trajectory part of the update .",
    "this paper should be seen as an addendum to our previous paper in which full details are given of the action , simulation methods and basic hadronic measurements .",
    "some preliminary results from this work were presented in  @xcite .",
    "recent related work using improved wilson fermions includes that of the jlqcd collaboration  @xcite which uses the same action and covers a similar range of quark masses to our earlier work but which also includes simulations in larger volumes ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the qcdsf collaboration has been conducting simulations complementary to those of ukqcd , most recently using an improved algorithm  @xcite .",
    "neither of these simulations sets has penetrated the lighter quark regime . in each case @xmath12 .",
    "the qq+q collaboration  @xcite has succeeded in simulating at one half ( or less ) of the strange quark mass but with rather coarse lattice spacing ( @xmath13 fm ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : simul ]",
    ", we describe the parameters and performance of the new simulations .",
    "the lattice spacing is determined from the static potential and decorrelation effects are studied using measurements of the topological susceptibility . in section  [ sec : spect ] , we present the additions to our previous collection of data for the hadron spectrum and meson decay constants and use them to search for first signs of chiral logs . results from new measurements of disconnected loops , including the @xmath14 mass , are presented in section  [ sec : discon ] .",
    "we present results on the topological susceptibility in section  [ sec : top ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the simulations were conducted using the standard hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm as described in  @xcite using lattice action parameters @xmath15 and a lattice volume @xmath16 .",
    "a total of @xmath17 trajectories were accumulated at the rate of about @xmath18 per hour on a machine sustaining @xmath19 gflops . in physical units ,",
    "the lattice volume was @xmath20 and @xmath21 before chiral or continuum extrapolation .",
    "the lattice spacing was estimated from the measured hadronic scale parameter @xcite : @xmath22 the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath23 of the mean plaquette was found to be @xmath24 trajectories .",
    "this follows the previously observed trend of a _ decrease _ of @xmath23 with decreasing quark mass . for comparison , @xmath25 at @xmath26 where @xmath27 . for",
    "the present ensemble , @xmath28 ( see later ) .",
    "although not expected , this trend can be accommodated in simple models  @xcite .",
    "the mean plaquette was @xmath29 these hmc runs are expected to be susceptible to instabilities ( occasional large @xmath30 values and zero acceptance ) when the fermion force term gets too large @xcite .",
    "we have observed this effect directly in the present simulations where we found it necessary to use a step size of @xmath31 .",
    "when the step size is this , or smaller , we found that @xmath32 bit arithmetic for field storage and matrix - vector manipulations was required so as to avoid a serious loss of acceptance due to rounding errors ( see below ) .",
    "this was true even though we always used full 64-bit arithmetic and careful summing techniques for the global summation in our @xmath30 ( energy difference ) calculations .",
    "fig.[fig : histldh ] shows a histogram of @xmath33 for all trajectories where @xmath34 . for comparison",
    "we also show the corresponding histogram for the well - behaved simulation at @xmath35 described in @xcite .",
    "the sample size in each case is the same .",
    "histogram of @xmath36 ( positive values of @xmath30 only ) for this ensemble ( darker bars ) and for a similar sized sample from simulations at @xmath26 . ]",
    "the anomalous trajectories leading to very large values of @xmath30 are clearly visible in the simulation at @xmath37 .",
    "the simulation was an experimental one and incorporated several changes of simulation parameters ( step size and solver accuracy _ etc .",
    "_ ) leading to large changes in acceptance .",
    "thus one should bear in mind the possible consequences of this on the discussion of autocorrelation times and error analysis .    in fig.[fig :",
    "history ] we show a time history of the mean plaquette along with the average acceptance ( integrated over 10 trajectories ) .",
    "the dramatic drop in acceptance associated with a change to 32-bit arithmetic is clearly visible .",
    "the location of the changes are indicated by the horizontal bars .",
    "the loss of acceptance was not significantly dependent on the size of the solver residual in the molecular dynamics steps ( using a running rather than absolute residual ) .",
    "as noted above , it was primarily dependent on the arithmetic used in the matrix - vector calculations .    despite the rather chequered history of the configurations we decided to subject them to physics analysis .",
    "this ensemble represented an expensive investment in computer time and promised to give access to relatively light quark masses ( by wilson lattice quark standards ) . in view of the above remarks ,",
    "one should bear in mind the deficiencies of the markov process that led to their generation .",
    "we may attempt , in due course , to repeat the simulations at this lattice spacing and quark mass using improved algorithms , faster machines and larger lattices .",
    "in this section we report on the light spectroscopy from this ensemble .",
    "we use a similar analysis to our original work on the spectroscopy of nonperturbatively - improved clover fermions at @xmath38 = 5.2  @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on the unitary sector of the theory  with valence quarks equal in mass to the sea quarks .",
    "we have previously reported  @xcite some evidence for chiral logs in a partially quenched analysis with @xmath39 = 0.1355 and @xmath40 = 0.1358 .",
    "we use fuzzed and local sources and sinks combined to make a variational fit . to determine the pion decay constant",
    ", we fit with two states an order 4 variational matrix with fuzzed and local sources using the @xmath41 and @xmath42 operators to create a pion .    to increase statistics , we use quark propagators with sources on the time planes 7 , 15 , and 23 in addition to the @xmath43 plane for @xmath44 values 0.1358 , 0.1355 , and 0.1350 . in our",
    "first published work we only used the quark propagators from time plane @xmath43 .",
    "thus we report new numbers at @xmath44 = 0.1350 and 0.1355 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 with reduced error bars .    in fig.[fg :",
    "meff ] we show the effective mass plot for the pseudoscalar channel ( ps ) at @xmath47 .",
    "the results from the fits are in tables  [ tab : condata ] , [ tab : fpidata ] .",
    "we investigated the stability of the fits in a number of ways .",
    "since the spectrum fits used two states , the ground state is expected ( and indeed found ) to be very stable while the excited state values should be regarded as indicative , although these values are consistent with the expected lightest multi - body states at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for pseudoscalar and vector , respectively .    .",
    "masses in lattice units from this calculation . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the fits to the @xmath50 data we could obtain a fit with three exponentials .",
    "we regard the last exponential as representing the truncation error , hence we have information on one excited state . the mass of the excited state at @xmath51 is 1.5(2 ) gev with unknown systematic errors from the lack of continuum extrapolation and chiral extrapolation .",
    "this is encouragingly close to the the mass of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 mesons .",
    "when the systematics in the lattice calculation are under control , the comparison with experiment will also require an understanding of the mixing .",

    "the curve is described in the text . ]    for the @xmath37 data , we are unable to obtain convincing and consistent fits .",
    "those shown illustrate the problem .",
    "we use a different method to show the impact of the data : namely a direct comparison between the sp correlators at the two kappa values , see fig.[fig_kratio ] . for the ll and ff correlators",
    "( with @xmath41 at source and sink ) the ratios are consistent with @xmath54 as shown , where we have relied more on the ff data since it has a larger contribution from the ground state .",
    "this mass difference can then be used to extract an estimate of the sp mass at @xmath37 of @xmath55 . note that although the sp mass is approximately constant as the quark mass is reduced , the pion mass ( in lattice units ) decreases by about 0.09 and thus the difference between the sp mass and the pion mass increases .",
    "this large mass splitting is consistent with the steep rise shown in fig.[fig_d_by_c ] .    because the signal to noise is so poor",
    ", we also explore singlet correlators with non - zero momentum .",
    "one has to be careful since , at non - zero momentum , the axial ( a@xmath56 ) pion operator ( @xmath57 ) has contamination from @xmath58  so factorising fits need additional care for the a@xmath56a@xmath56 term . for @xmath50 , we can fit for momentum @xmath59 ( in units of @xmath60 ) . for @xmath37",
    ", we find no useful additional constraint from the momentum non - zero correlators .",
    "the mass of the sp meson in two flavour qcd is not immediately available from experiment since the well known mixing between the @xmath14 and @xmath61 obscures this issue . by assuming some mixing scheme , we can obtain an estimate of the mass of the sp particle . in our previous analysis",
    "@xcite , the mass of the sp meson was @xmath62 . using values",
    "consistent with phenomenology and our previous lattice data ( @xmath63 = 0.695 gev , @xmath64 @xmath65 ) , we obtained 0.861 gev as the mass of the sp meson in @xmath66 qcd .",
    "another approach is to use the witten - veneziano expression .",
    "the sesam/@xmath67 collaboration  @xcite obtain 715 mev for mass of the sp in @xmath68 = 2 qcd .",
    "the chiral extrapolation formulae used in the lattice qcd literature  @xcite have either used the mass or square of the mass of the sp meson linear in the quark mass .",
    "it would be clearly better to have a more theoretical justification of the light quark mass dependence , although `` traditional '' chiral perturbation theory is not reliable at mass scales appropriate to the sp state  @xcite .    in fig.[worldeta",
    "] , the world data for the sp mass is plotted as a function of the pseudoscalar to vector mass ratio .",
    "our point at @xmath51 is consistent with the data from other groups .",
    "the mass at @xmath47 lies above the trend from larger quark mass , but we do expect the sp mass to go to a non - zero constant as the quark mass vanishes . indeed our semi - phenomenological estimate given above was that the sp mass in the chiral limit is @xmath69 mev .",
    "this value is very consistent with the flattening behaviour indicated by our data point .    for their final result ,",
    "cp - pacs  @xcite quoted the mass of the sp particle as @xmath70 gev .",
    "this high value arises from the continuum extrapolation .",
    "the central value for the mass was obtained by linearly extrapolated in lattice spacing with a @xmath71 of @xmath72 .",
    "a quadratic extrapolation in the lattice spacing had a @xmath71 of @xmath73 , with the resulting mass of @xmath74 gev .",
    "the use of a linear extrapolation with lattice spacing is consistent with the rest of the spectroscopy program of cp - pacs  @xcite .",
    "the large errors in the mass of the sp meson from cp - pacs represent the variation from the different continuum extrapolations .     and",
    "@xmath47 from this work and @xmath75 from ref .",

    " sized bins , and the gaussian curve derived from the central value of topological susceptibility ( and one standard deviation either side as outlying curves ) .",
    "[ fig_q ] ]    the topological charge , @xmath79 , and its associated susceptibility , @xmath80 are expected to be especially sensitive to the presence and properties of the sea quarks in qcd . as the mass of the sea quarks is reduced ( towards the chiral limit )",
    ", the topological susceptibility is suppressed below its quenched value . for sufficiently large volumes ,",
    "the leading order chiral behaviour is @xcite @xmath81 for two degenerate flavours ( and using a normalisation where @xmath82 ) . as @xmath83 , @xmath84 the quenched value which is around @xmath85 .",
    "the higher order corrections in eq.([eqn_chi_chi ] ) must therefore introduce a negative curvature at some intermediate quark mass @xcite .    on the lattice ,",
    "the topological susceptibility becomes renormalised relative to the continuum value , @xmath86 , both multiplicatively and additively @xcite : @xmath87 broadly speaking , @xmath88 arises from the presence of `` dislocations '' : short range fluctuations in the gauge field that masquerade as small instantons .",
    "@xmath89 reflects the breaking of scale invariance on the lattice , whereby small instantons have a topological charge less than unity . at large quark masses ( or in the quenched theory ) the first term in eq.([eqn_chi_renorm ] ) dominates , suppressing @xmath90 at non ",
    "zero @xmath91 . in the chiral limit , however , @xmath92 dominates and is non ",
    "zero even after smoothing .",
    "the topological susceptibility then shows strong discretisation effects that act to _ increase _ @xmath90 at finite lattice spacing .",
    "whilst comparing `` matched '' ensembles at fixed lattice spacing will control discretisation effects , these opposite trends imply that they will not cancel away entirely .",
    "the net effect is that is that any chiral suppression of the topological susceptibility at given @xmath91 relative to the quenched value at an equivalent lattice spacing will be less than in the continuum limit .",
    "we measure @xmath79 using the method of @xcite : @xmath93 cooling sweeps are applied using the wilson gauge action .",
    "ten cools strikes a good balance between adequate suppression of these ultraviolet dislocations and excessive destruction of the long range topological structure @xcite . a reflection  symmetrised `` twisted plaquette '' lattice topological charge operator is used @xcite .",
    "as discussed previously , good decorrelation of @xmath79 is seen in the simulation , and the histogram of the populations of the different topological sectors in fig.[fig_q ] has the expected gaussian form .",
    "we find @xmath94 , consistent with zero .",
    "the susceptibility is @xmath95 , or @xmath96 if we subtract terms in @xmath97 .",
    "we plot the latter result as the leftmost point in fig.[fig_khi ] , alongside previously published ukqcd results @xcite .",
    "we show also the equivalent quenched susceptibility as a bar whose length reflects both the statistical uncertainty in the quenched measurements and the small variation in lattice spacing across the ensembles depicted , despite the presence of discretisation effects .",

    "mass for two flavours of @xmath0improved fermions . quenched values for this range of lattice spacing are shown as a bar on the rhs of the plot .",
    "[ fig_khi ] ]    for eq.([eqn_chi_chi ] ) to hold , we require @xmath98 @xcite . using the continuum value of @xmath99 ( which is lower than the value at finite lattice spacing ) we find @xmath100 .",
    "finite volume effects appear to be less significant for @xmath90 than , for instance , the light hadron spectrum .",
    "studies for this action indicate that @xmath101 is sufficient for such finite size effects to be within the statistical uncertainty in @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , comparison of data at finite lattice spacings with continuum predictions must be made cautiously .",
    "that being said , fig .",
    "[ fig_khi ] is very encouraging and is evidence for the improved chiral properties of the @xmath8improved action . performing a leading order [ in @xmath102 fit , or an interpolating fit across the chiral range @xcite",
    ", we see that the slope near the origin of fig .",
    "[ fig_khi ] is slightly greater than that expected from the continuum value of @xmath99 .",
    "as discretisation effects are expected to increase the pseudoscalar decay constant , this is in agreement with theoretical expectations . in a forthcoming paper discretisation effects",
    "will be examined in more detail @xcite .    finally , it is interesting to compare these results with those obtained for three flavours of improved staggered sea quarks @xcite . for similar lattice spacings , @xmath103 ,",
    "the topological susceptibility was non  zero and roughly constant below @xmath104 , when @xmath90 presumably became dominated by @xmath92 .",
    "no statistically significant evidence for such a trend can yet be seen for the @xmath8improved action , however .",
    "although we are excited to have finally reached a region of parameter space where unquenched clover calculations are starting to see chiral logs and uncover interesting behaviour in the mass of the singlet pseudoscalar meson , it is not yet clear how to improve on these results .",
    "if we implemented some of the new updating algorithms  @xcite for clover fermions , in principle we could work at a larger volume with fewer of the problems reported in section  [ sec : simul ] .",
    "however , concerns have been raised about the interaction  @xcite of the wilson gauge action with the clover fermion action in unquenched calculations .",
    "once improved gauge actions have been incorporated into the non - perturbative clover improvement formalism for fermions , we could study the chiral log structure , at fixed lattice spacing  @xcite , this would allow important comparisons with the results from other unquenched lattice qcd calculations that use different fermion formalisms  @xcite .",
