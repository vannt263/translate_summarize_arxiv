    "the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in an ideal bose gas is by now a textbook material and has recently seen a huge revival of interest driven mostly by new experiments .",
    "consider an ideal gas of @xmath0 bosons in a @xmath1-dimensional hybercubic box of volume @xmath2 . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath3 , @xmath4 but with the density @xmath5 fixed , as one reduces the temperature below a certain critical value @xmath6 in @xmath7 , macroscopically large number of particles ( @xmath8 ) condense on to the ground state , i.e. , in the zero momentum quantum state .",
    "alternately , one encounters the same condensation transition upon fixing the temperature but increasing the density @xmath9 beyond a critical value @xmath10 .",
    "the traditional bec happens in the momentum ( or equivalently energy ) space .",
    "in contrast , over the last two decades it has been realized that a ` similar ' bose - einstein type condensation can also occur in _ real space _ in the steady state of a variety of nonequilibrium systems such as in cluster aggregation and fragmentation  @xcite , jamming in traffic and granular flow  @xcite and granular clustering  @xcite . the common characteristic feature that these systems share is the stochastic transport of some conserved scalar quantity which can simply be called mass .",
    "condensation transition in these systems occurs when above some critical mass density a single ` condensate ' captures a finite fraction of the total mass of the system .",
    "` condensate ' corresponds to a dominant cluster in the context of granular clustering , or a single large jam in the context of traffic models .",
    "another example of condensation is found in the phase separation dynamics in one dimensional driven systems where the condensation manifests itself in the emergence of a macroscopic domain of one phase  @xcite .",
    "other examples of such real - space condensation can be found in the socioeconomic contexts : for example , in wealth condensation in macroeconomics where a single individual or a company ( condensate ) owns a finite fraction of the total wealth  @xcite or in growing networks where a single node or hub ( such as ` google ' ) may capture a finite fraction of links in the network  @xcite .",
    "this real - space condensation mentioned above has been studied theoretically in very simple stochastic mass transport models defined on lattices .",
    "these are typically nonequilibrium models without any hamiltonian and are defined by their microscopic dynamical rules that specify how some scalar quantities such as masses or a certain number of particles get transported from site to site of the lattice .",
    "these rules typically violate detailed balance  @xcite . under these rules ,",
    "the system evolves into a _ stationary _ or _ steady _ state which are typically not gibbs - boltzmann state as the system lacks a hamiltonian  @xcite . for a class of transport rules ,",
    "the system can reach a steady state where upon increasing the density of mass or particles beyond a critical value , a macroscopically large mass ( or number of particles ) condenses onto a single site of the lattice , signalling the onset of ` real - space ' condensation .    in this article",
    "we will mostly focus on _ homogeneous _ systems where the transport rules are independent of sites , i.e. , the system is translationally invariant . in the condensed phase and in an infinite system , the condensate forms at a single site which thus breaks the translational invariance spontaneously . in a finite system",
    ", the condensate at a given site has a finite lifetime beyond which it dissolves and then gets relocated at a different site and the various time scales associated with the formation / relocation of the condensate diverge with the increasing system size ( see later ) . in _ heterogeneous _ systems where the transport rules may differ from site to site",
    ", the condensate may form at a site with the lowest outgoing mass transport rate  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the condensation transition in such heterogeneous systems is exactly analogus to the traditional bec in momentum space and the site with the lowest outgoing mass trasfer rate plays the role of the ground state in the quantum system of ideal bose gas .",
    "in contrast , the mechanism of condensation in homogeneous systems , the subject of focus here , is rather different : the onset and formation of a condensate in an infinite system is associated with the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance .",
    "also , unlike the traditional equilibrium bose gas in a box , this real - space condensation in nonequilibrium mass transport models can occur _ even in one dimension_.    the purpose of these lectures is to understand the phenomenon of real - space condensation in homogeneous systems within the context of simple one dimensional mass transport models .",
    "the main questions we will be addressing are threefold : ( i ) when does the condensation happen i.e. to find the criterion for condensation ( ii ) how does the condensation happen  i.e .",
    ", to unfold the mathematical mechanism behind such a transition if it happens and ( iii ) what is the nature of the condensate e.g. , to compute the distribution of mass or the number of particles in the condensate .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "in section ii we will discuss three simple and well studied lattice models of stochastic mass transport . in section iii , we will consider a generalized mass transport model that includes the previous three models as special cases and investigate its steady state .",
    "in particular , we will study in detail steady states that are factorisable .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for such factorisable property will be discussed .",
    "thanks to this factorisable property , a detailed analytical study of the condensation is possible for such steady states which will be illustrated in section iv . in section v we will illustrate how various results associated with the condensation transition in factorisable steady states can be simply understood in terms of sums and extremes of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) random variables .",
    "finally we will conclude in section vi with a summary and other possible generalizations / issues associated with the real - space condensation .",
    "the zero range process ( zrp ) , introduced by spitzer  @xcite , is perhaps one of the simplest analytically solvable model of mass / particle transport that exhibits a real - space condensation in certain range of its parameters  for a review see  @xcite .",
    "zrp is defined on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider a @xmath11-d lattice with @xmath12 sites , the generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward",
    ". on each site of the lattice at any instant of time rests a number of particles , say @xmath13 at site @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a nonnegative integer .",
    "we can also think of each particle carrying a unit mass , so that @xmath13 represents the total mass at site @xmath14 .",
    "a configuration of the system at any given instant is specified by the masses at all sites @xmath16 .",
    "one starts from an arbitrary initial condition with a total mass @xmath17 .",
    "the subsequent dynamics conserves this total mass or total particle number , or equivalently the density @xmath18 .",
    "the system evolves via continuous - time stochastic dynamics specified by the following rules :    @xmath19 in a small time interval @xmath20 , a single particle from site @xmath14 with @xmath13 number of particles is transported to its right neighbour @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 provided @xmath23 . in terms of mass , this means a single unit of mass is transferred from site @xmath14 to site @xmath21 with rate @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath19 nothing happens with probability @xmath25 .",
    "here @xmath26 is an arbitrary positive function , with the constraint that @xmath27 , since there can not be any transfer of unit mass if the site has no mass at all .",
    "thus in zrp , the particle or mass transfer rate @xmath26 depends only on the number of particles / mass @xmath28 at the departure site prior to the transfer .",
    "one can of course generalize easily the zrp to discrete - time dynamics , with symmetric transfer of particles to both neighbours etc  @xcite .",
    "but here we stick to the asymmetric continuous - time model for simplicity .",
    "as the system evolves under this dynamics , the probability of a configuration @xmath29 evolves in time and in the long time limit , @xmath30 , it approaches a time - independent stationary joint distribution of masses @xmath31 .",
    "this is the basic quantity of interest , since the statistics of all other physical observables in the steady state can , in principle , be computed from this joint distribution . in many such nonequilibrium systems ,",
    "computing the steady state @xmath32 is , indeed , the first big hurdle  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , in zrp , this can be computed explicitly and has a rather simple factorised form  @xcite @xmath33 where the weight function @xmath34 is related to the transfer rate @xmath26 via @xmath35 the delta function in eq .",
    "( [ zrp_jpm1 ] ) specifies the conserved total mass @xmath36 and @xmath37 is just a normalization factor that ensures that the total probability is unity and satisfies a simple recursion relation @xmath38 to prove the result in eq .",
    "( [ zrp_jpm1 ] ) one simply writes down the master equation for the evolution of the probability in the configuration space and then verifies  @xcite that the stationary solution of this master equation is indeed given by ( [ zrp_jpm1 ] ) .",
    "finally , the single site mass distribution @xmath39 , defined as the probability that any site has mass @xmath28 in the steady state , is just the marginal obtained from the joint distribution @xmath40 note that @xmath39 implicitly depends on @xmath12 but this @xmath12 dependence has been suppressed for notational simplicity . this single site mass distribution is important as any signature of the existence of a condensate will definitely show up in the explicit form of @xmath39 .",
    "evidently the steady state @xmath39 depends on the transfer rate @xmath26 through the weight function @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ zrp_weight1 ] ) .",
    "not all choices of @xmath26 lead to a steady state with a condensation transition .",
    "indeed , one may ask what choices of @xmath26 may lead to a condensation transition .",
    "an example of such a choice is given by @xmath41 for large @xmath28 , which leads to , using eq .",
    "( [ zrp_weight1 ] ) , a power law weight function , @xmath42 for large @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", it was shown  @xcite that for @xmath43 , the system undergoes a condensation transition as one increases the density @xmath9 through a critical value @xmath44 .",
    "the condensation transition shows up in @xmath39 in the thermodynamic limit , which has different forms for @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47  @xcite @xmath48\\quad { \\rm for } \\quad \\rho<\\rho_c",

    "( [ fig : dist ] ) ) . the term  condensate \" in eq .",
    "( [ zrp_spm2 ] ) refers to this additional bump .",
    "physically this means that a single condensate coexists with a background critical fluid for @xmath47 .",
    "this change of behavior of @xmath39 as one increases @xmath9 through @xmath52 is a prototype signature of the real - space condensation and one finds this behavior in various other stochastic mass transport models that will be discussed below .",
    "in addition , many details of the condensation phenomena in zrp also follow as special cases of the more general mass transport model defined in section iii .    before ending this subsection ,",
    "it is useful to point out that there have been several other issues and studies on zrp and related models that are not covered here .",
    "the interested readers may consult the reviews  @xcite .",
    "here we discuss another simple one dimensional mass transport model that also exhibits a condensation phase transition in its steady state . as in zrp , this model is also defined on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions where each site @xmath14 carries an integer mass @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "a non - lattice mean - field version of the model was studied in ref .",
    "the system evolves via the continuous - time dynamics defined by the following rules  @xcite :    @xmath19 _ diffusion and aggregation _ : in a small time interval @xmath20 , the entire mass @xmath13 from site @xmath14 moves either to its right neighbour @xmath53 with probability @xmath54 or to its left neighbour @xmath55 with probability @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath19 _ chipping _ : in the same interval @xmath20 , only one unit of mass chips off site @xmath14 with mass @xmath13 ( provided @xmath23 ) to either its right neighbour with probability @xmath56 or to its left neighbour with probability @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath19 with probability @xmath57 nothing happens .",
    "once again the total mass @xmath58 is conserved by the dynamics .",
    "the model thus has two parameters @xmath9 ( density)and @xmath59 ( the ratio of the chipping to the diffusion rate ) . at long times",

    "in fact , it is believed  @xcite that @xmath32 does not have a simple product measure ( factorisable ) form as in zrp in eq .",
    "( [ zrp_jpm1 ] ) .",
    "another important difference is that in zrp , the condensation transition happens both for asymmetric as well as symmetric transfer of masses to the neighbours , as long as one chooses the rate @xmath26 appropriately .",
    "in contrast , for the chipping model , a true condensation transition happens in the thermodynamic limit only for the symmetric transfer of masses . for the asymmetric transfer of masses ( say only to the right neighbour ) , the condensed phase disapears in the thermodynamic limit even though for finite @xmath12 one does see a vestige of condensation transition  @xcite .",
    "however , a generalization that includes both the chipping model and zrp as special cases does appear to have a condensation transition even with asymmetric hopping  @xcite .",
    "finally , when the diffusion rate depends on the mass of the departure site in the chipping model in a certain manner , the condensation transition disappears  @xcite .",
    "this simple chipping model with aggregation and fragmentation rules have been useful in various experimental contexts such as in the growth of palladium nanoparticles  @xcite . besides , the possibility of such a condensation phase transition driven by the aggregation mechanism has been discussed in a system of au sputtered by swift heavy ions  @xcite . finally , the chipping model and its various generalizations have also been studied in the context of traffic  @xcite , finance  @xcite and networks  @xcite .",
    "another simple mass transport model that has been studied extensively  @xcite is the asymmetric random average process ( arap ) . as in the previous two models",
    ", arap is defined on a one dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions . however , in contrast to zrp and the chipping model , here the mass @xmath13 at each site @xmath14 is assumed to be a continuous positive variable .",
    "the model has been studied for both continuous - time as well as discrete - time dynamics  @xcite . in the continuous - time version ,",
    "the microscopic evolution rules are  @xcite :    @xmath19 in a small time interval @xmath20 , a random fraction @xmath66 of the mass @xmath13 at site @xmath14 is transported to the right neighbour @xmath53 with probability @xmath20 , where @xmath67 $ ] is a random number chosen , independently for each site @xmath14 , from a uniform distribution over @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "@xmath19 with probability @xmath69 , nothing happens .",
    "the dynamics evidently conserves the total mass @xmath58 . at long times ,",
    "the system reaches a steady state .",
    "once again , the joint distribution of masses @xmath32 in the steady state does not have a factorised product measure form as in zrp .",
    "how does the single site mass distribution @xmath39 look like in the large @xmath12 limit ?",
    "first important point one notices here is that the density @xmath9 obviously sets the overall mass scale in this model . in other words , the mass distribution @xmath70 for any given @xmath9 must have an exact scaling form @xmath71 where the scaling function @xmath72 must satisfy conditions @xmath73 the first condition follows from normalization , @xmath74 and the second from the mass conservation , @xmath75 . since the dynamics involves transfering a uniform fraction of mass from one site to its neighbour , the scaling in eq .",
    "( [ arap_sc1 ] ) is preserved by the dynamics .",
    "this is in contrast to zrp or the chipping model , where one chips of a single unit of mass from one site to its neighbour and thereby the dynamics introduces a separate mass scale ( unit mass ) , in addition to the overall density @xmath9 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath72 for arap has been computed within the mean field theory  @xcite @xmath76 and this mean field result is remarkably close to the numerical results in one dimension , even though one can prove rigorously  @xcite that the joint distribution of masses do not factorise .",
    "in contrast , for arap defined with a parallel discrete - time dynamics ( where all sites are updated simultaneously ) , it has been proved  @xcite that the joint distribution of masses factorise as in zrp and the scaling function @xmath72 for the single site mass distribution can be computed exactly , @xmath77 .",
    "the steady state of the discrete - time arap is also related to the steady state of the so called @xmath78-model of force fluctuations in granular materials  @xcite    what about condensation ? in arap , one does not find a condensation transition .",
    "this is of course expected since the density @xmath9 just sets the mass scale and one does not expect to see a change of behavior in the mass distribution upon increasing @xmath9 , apart from a trivial rescaling of the mass at all sites by a constant factor @xmath9 .",
    "however , one can induce a condensation transition in arap by inducing an additional mass scale , e.g. , by imposing a maximum threshold on the amount of mass that may be transferred from a site to its neighbour  @xcite .",
    "let us reflect for a moment what we have learnt so far from the three models discussed above .",
    "it is clear that the dynamics of mass transport often , though not always , may lead to a steady state that exhibits real - space condensation .",
    "for example , the zrp and the symmetric chipping model exhibit real - space condensation , but not the arap . also , we note that some of these models such as zrp have a simple factorisable steady state .",
    "but _ factorisability of the steady state is clearly not a necessary condition for a system to exhibit real - space condensation _ , as we have learnt , e.g. , from the study of the symmetric chipping model where the steady state is not factorisable .",
    "the factorisability , if present , of course helps the mathematical analysis .",
    "so , a natural question is : given a set of microscopic mass transport rules , what are the necessary and sufficient conditions that they may lead to a steady state that exhibits real - space condensation ?",
    "for example , from the study of the three models above it seems that in order to have a condensation one needs to introduce via the dynamics a different mass scale , in addition to the density , such as the chipping of a single unit of mass in zrp and the symmetric chipping model , or via introducing a maximum cap on the mass to be transferred in arap .",
    "if there is only one overall mass scale ( density ) that is preserved by the dynamics as in the usual arap , one does not expect to see a phase transition in the mass distribution as one changes the density .",
    "this question about finding the conditions for real - space condensation in a generic mass transport model seems too general and is perhaps difficult to answer .",
    "instead , one useful strategy is to restrict ourselves to a special class of mass transport models that have a factorisable steady state and then ask for the criterion , mechanism and nature of the real - space condensation phenomenon within this restricted class of mass transport models , which includes zrp as a special class .",
    "this strategy has been demonstrated to work rather successfully in a recent series of papers  @xcite and a fairly good understanding of the real - space condensation phenonemon has been developed within this restricted class of mass transport models .",
    "this is what we will briefly discuss in this section .    * a generalized mass transport model :",
    "* one can include all the three models discussed in section ii in a more generalized mass transport model  @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we define the model here on a one dimensional ring of @xmath12 sites with asymmetric transfer rules , but it can be generalized in a straightforward manner on arbitrary graphs and arbitrary transfer rules .",
    "similar mass transport models with open boundaries as well as dissipation at each site have also been studied  @xcite , though here we restrict ourselves to periodic boundary conditions and non - dissipative dynamics that preserve the total mass .",
    "on each site of the ring there is a scalar continuous mass @xmath13 . at any given time",
    "@xmath79 one chooses a mass @xmath80 independently at each site from a probability distribution @xmath81 , normalized such that @xmath82 . in the time interval",
    "@xmath83 $ ] , the mass @xmath84 is transfered from site @xmath14 to site @xmath21 , simultaneously for all sites @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : transport ] ) ) . in a ring geometry",
    ", one identifies the site @xmath85 with the site @xmath11 .",
    "thus , after this transfer , the new masses at times @xmath86 are given by  @xcite @xmath87 where the second term on the right hand side denotes the mass that has left site @xmath14 and the third term denotes the mass that came to site @xmath14 from site @xmath55 .",

    "we take a homogeneous chipping kernel @xmath88 which does not depend on the site index .",
    "note that the model above has been defined with parallel dynamics where all sites are updated simultaneously .",
    "of course , by chossing @xmath89 , one can recover the continuous - time random sequential dynamics where the probability that two sites will be updated simultaneously is very small @xmath90 .",
    "thus the parallel dynamics includes the continuous - time ( random sequential ) dynamics as a special case .",
    "note that for random sequential dynamics @xmath88 must generically be of the form @xmath91 \\delta(\\mu ) \\label{rsd1}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 denotes the _ rate _ at which a mass @xmath93 leaves a site with mass @xmath28 and the second term denotes the probability that no mass leaves the site .",

    "this model with a general chipping kernel @xmath88 includes the previously discussed zrp , chipping model and arap as special cases  @xcite .",

    "<S> the phenomenon of real - space condensation is encountered in a variety of situations such as aggregation and fragmentation processes , granular clustering , phase separation , traffic and networks . unlike traditional bose - einstein condensation in the _ momentum space _ , a condensate in these systems forms in _ real space _ , e.g. , upon increasing the density beyond a critical value a macroscopically large mass / cluster may form at a single site on a lattice . in this brief review , </S>",
    "<S> i discuss some recent developments in understanding the physical and mathematical mechanism behind this real - space condensation in a class of simple stochastic mass transport models . </S>"
