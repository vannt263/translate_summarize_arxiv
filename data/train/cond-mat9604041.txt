    "the existence of persistent currents in a conducting mesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic flux was proposed for the first time by bttiker , imry and landauer @xcite and experimentally observed in an ensemble of rings and in semiconductor and metallic loops @xcite . in a ring",
    ", the magnetic flux can be introduced through a boundary condition for the electronic wave function . @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the radius of the ring , @xmath2 is a quantum of magnetic flux and @xmath3 is the real magnetic flux encircled by the loop .",
    "equation ( 1 ) introduces a periodicity to all the physical properties of the system as a function of @xmath3 with the period associated to @xmath4 . for a particular energy level",
    "the persistent current flowing along the system can be obtained by calculating the derivative of the energy with respect to the magnetic flux .",
    "the total current is obtained summing the contributions over all the occupied states below the fermi level .    since the original experiment @xcite",
    "there has been a considerable theoretical effort to understand currents and current fluctuations of non - interacting electrons in open and closed rings @xcite .",
    "many works was devoted to study the effect of electronic interaction upon the current in closed rings and the interplay between correlation and disorder has been reported in this systems using a number of different methods @xcite . from an experimental point of view , works emphasizing on different geometries in open and closed systems has been reported and transport through a quantum dot embbeded in the ring has been studied @xcite .",
    "we study the persistent currents flowing in a mesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic flux and connected to a stub of finite length .",
    "a change in the magnetic field produces level crossings and eventually an interchange of position between the ground state and the first excited level",
    ". this crossing gives rise to metastable situations .",
    "a metastable state corresponds to a local minimum of the energy in the parameter space separated by an energy barrier from the absolute minimum .",
    "so , if this particular state is obtained through an adiabatic variation of the magnetic flux , the system is unable to reach its ground state remaining in the relative local minimum .",
    "this multistability can occur in a interacting perfect ring and also in a inhomogeneous one , as it is the case of a perfect ring plus a stub of finite length . in this last case",
    "the stub acts as a reservoir of particles and the magnetic flux crossing the ring plays the role that the external applied potential fulfills in transport in standard mesoscopic heterostructures .",
    "this system has already been studied @xcite focusing other properties , within the context of the electrochemical capacity ideas .",
    "the structure is described by a tight - binding hamiltonian given by :    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    where @xmath8 corresponds to the ring , @xmath9 to the stub , which is a wire of finite length connected to the ring through the hamiltonian @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the numbers of atomic sites belonging to the ring and to the stub respectively . for the ring",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath13 , and the magnetic flux is incorporated as the boundary condition ( 1 ) .",
    "we model the gate potential which controls the state of charge of the stub through the diagonal elements of @xmath9 given by @xmath14 . for the case of ballistic transport in an isolated ring , we have verified that the properties of the system are weakly dependent upon the spatial range of the e - e interaction .",
    "the effects of non - locality in the coulomb interaction could be restricted to the first neighbor intersite electronic repulion @xmath15 that controls the effects that the charge accumulated in the stub has on the currents circulating along the ring .",
    "restricted to the intrasite and first neighbour intersite contributions , the coulomb interaction can be written as @xmath16 .",
    "the current is characterized by an energy scale that is given by the energy difference between two successive states below the fermi level ( @xmath17 ) . for small values of @xmath17",
    "it results to be : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the integer number that defines the state wave vector @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the lattice parameter .",
    "although due to numerical limitations we are obliged to take a ring with small number of atoms , it is possible to get an adequate physical representation of the system by scaling the coulomb parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 to the energy difference @xmath24 defined at the neighbourhood of the fermi level .",
    "the size of a disordered ring is an extremely important parameter to study the properties of persistent currents because the localization length of the states near the fermi energy defines a characteristic length in the system .",
    "the behaviour is different whether the size of the ring is bigger or smaller than this magnitude .",
    "however , for an ordered ring , the absence of this length permits to take an ideal small 1-d loop to study a real ring .",
    "also it is necessary to suppose that it is thin enough as to produce a sufficient energy separation of the different channels created by the lateral confinement .    to find the ground state we use a standard lanczos algorithm .",
    "the knowledge of it permits to calculate several quantities of interest for the problem : the current in the ring , the charge in the stub and the total spin of the ground state as function of the external magnetic flux and of the gate potential @xmath14 .",
    "the current is calculated as the mean value on the ground state of the operator @xmath25    @xmath26",
    "we study first an ordered ring just by assuming that @xmath27 .",
    "the persistent current of the non - interacting ring can be understood if we assume that the one particle energy levels move along the free particle dispersion relation as the magnetic field increases reducing the energy difference between the levels that correspond to the wave vector @xmath28 and @xmath29 for an arbitrary integer @xmath30 .    when the system possesses 2n particles there is an accidental degeneracy between the state with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the spin of the many body state .",
    "this occurs for a magnetic flux @xmath34 for the case in which @xmath19 is an odd integer or when @xmath35 if @xmath19 is even .",
    "it is important to notice that the state with @xmath32 is the ground state only for this particular value of flux ( @xmath36 ) . if @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an arbitrary small number , the ground state is in the @xmath31 subspace . in this case",
    "there is degeneracy but not level crossing .",
    "the coulomb forces between the electrons shift the accidental degeneracy to other values of @xmath39 ; @xmath40 for @xmath19 even and @xmath41 for @xmath19 odd as it is shown in fig .",
    "it is straightforward to realize that are the coulomb forces which originates the level crossing .",
    "when the number of particles is odd there is no accidental degener acy for the non - interacting case .",
    "however , for interacting electrons the states with @xmath42 and @xmath43 could coincide in energy for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , if the electronic repulsion were greater than the kinetic energy difference between the last two occupied levels .",
    "the two many body solutions mentioned above interchange their condition of being the ground state and the first excited state at @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 is small enough , a perturbative argument can be given as follows .",
    "let us suppose that the system has an even number of electrons and that its ground state has @xmath31 . increasing the magnetic flux , when @xmath48 the system could reduce its energy by occupying the state with total spin @xmath32 . here",
    "the two electrons next to the fermi level are unpaired : one has a positive wave vector @xmath49 and the other a negative one and both the same value of @xmath50 .",
    "however , for this process to take place during an adiabatic evolution , the system has to go through an intermediate state in which one of the electrons hops from the state with pos itive @xmath49 to another with negative value of @xmath49 without flipping its spin . due to the coulomb interaction , the energy of the intermediate state is greater than the energy of the flipped spin final state @xmath32 , and also is greater than the energy of the initial state s=0 due to its greater kinetic energy .",
    "so it defines the top of a potential barrier which separates both states . under the hypotesis of thermodynamic equilibrium , at @xmath46",
    "the system changes its current discontinuously from a positive to a negative value only if it is present an external spin flip mechanism capable of overcoming the potential barrier that exists separating both states in phase space .",
    "numerically this adiabatic process can be simulated as follows .",
    "it is necessary to obtain the ground state of the system threaded by a flux @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an arbitrary small flux .",
    "the wave function @xmath53 corresponding to the ground state of the system under the effect of the flux @xmath54 is taken as the starting state to begin the process .",
    "this state has a total spin @xmath55 and a total wave vector @xmath56 .",
    "it can be written as a linear combination of eigenstates of the hamiltonian with flux @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 note that a change in the magnetic flux produce an spread of the state over the quantum number @xmath60 but not in the s quantum number .",
    "let us call the state that provides the dominant contribution to equation ( 7 ) by @xmath61 , which possesses the total wave vector @xmath62 closest to the original @xmath56 , and the same total spin ( @xmath55 ) as the @xmath53 state ( within the numerical precision ) .",
    "it is fundamental to know if in this process the system will remain in a unstable or metastable situation or not . to clarify this point ,",
    "let us define the three dimensional space @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the total spin , the total wave vector and the energy respectively .",
    "the behavior of the system will depend on the topology of this space in the neighbourhood of the starting point defined by the state @xmath53 .",
    "suppose that the point corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath62 is an absolute minimum for the energy .",
    "then , the system evolving from a small region around this point will go always towards it . now",
    ", suppose that ther e is another minimum , which belongs to a different ( s , k ) subspace , and that it is the true absolute minimum .",
    "the existence of this minimum will modify the topology of the space around the starting point @xmath65 .",
    "however , if the energy difference between the two minima is not great enough , the topology around a small vecinity of the starting point will remain unchanged .",
    "then , the system evolving adiabatcally from this point will continue going toward the @xmath66 state .    an ideal tool to study this problem is the modified lanczos alghorithm used to find the ground state of the system .",
    "ths method requires the definition of a new state @xmath67 by applying the hamiltonian to the @xmath53 state and substracting the projection over it .",
    "the hamiltonian represented in the basis @xmath68 is diagonalized and the lowest energy state is taken as the starting new vector ( as it is always a better aproximation to the real ground state ) .",
    "this procedure is continued until convergence is reached . in the process of diagonalizing the 2x2 matrix at each step",
    "the lowest of the two diagonal elements ( @xmath69 ) determines the evolution of the initial state .",
    "the procedure follows a way in which the energy obtained at the @xmath19 step is lower than the energy at the step @xmath70 .",
    "if the state @xmath61 does correspond to a minimun in the parameter space the process goes toward it reducing the energy at each step . in the opposite situation , at an arbitrary step of the procedure",
    "the relation between @xmath71 and @xmath72 is inverted ( @xmath73 ) and the system evolves to the orthogonal state @xmath74 .",
    "the quantum numbers corresponding to this state are in general arbitrary far apart from the quantum numbers of the original state even for @xmath52 infinitesimally small .",
    "this is a procedure through which we are able to find numerically the frontiers of the bistable region",
    ".    then , when the magnetic flux is changed adiabatically in the neighborhood of @xmath75 , it is possible for the system to persist in a metastable state above and below @xmath36 , depending whether the flux is increasing or decreasing .",
    "this introduces a hysteresis loop that appears as a bistability in the i-@xmath3 characteristic curve as shown in fig .",
    "2 with a continuous line .    in standard double - barrier eterostructures ( dbh )",
    ", transport involves non linear phenomena reflected in the observation of multiple stabilities in the i - v characteristic curve in the region where the device exhibits a negative differential conduction @xcite .",
    "this property can be thought to be produced by an accumulation of electronic charge in the well at resonance and a rapid leakage of it when the applied voltage is just taken the device out of resonance .",
    "this non - linear effect is essentially a result of the interaction between the charges in the well and has been extensively studied theoretically assuming that the potential profile seen by the carriers , as they go along , depends in a self - consistent way upon the charge distribution @xcite .    for our system",
    ", a bistability very similar to the one described above for the dbh can be obtained in the @xmath76 characteristic curve .",
    "this is because there is a part of the system , the stub in our case , the well for the standard dbh , which is capable of acting as reservoirs of particles controlled by the external applied potential for the case of the dbh or by the external magnetic field or the gate potential in our case .",
    "let us focus our attention to the ring weakly coupled to the stub taking a small @xmath77 . in order to discuss conceptually the bistable behaviour",
    ", we define the energy per particle @xmath78 such that the total energy of the system is given by    @xmath79    where    @xmath80    and @xmath81 corresponds to the mean value on the ground state of the operators involved .",
    "@xmath82 refers to the energy of an electron without the coulomb interaction and @xmath83 is the number of electrons in the system .    in this case",
    "the phase space in which the bistability takes place is defined by the number of particles in the stub and the total spin .",
    "the starting state to initialize the numerical calculation is assumed to be the solution that corresponds to the previous smaller ( greater ) magnetic flux or @xmath84 .",
    "this procedure simulates the behaviour of the system when the flux or the gate potential is adiabatically increased ( decreased ) . in fig .",
    "3 we present the variation of the total energy and the @xmath85 levels of the ring and the stub as a function of the magnetic flux for the case with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 in units of the parameter @xmath90 .",
    "for such a small value of the coulomb parameters the pseudo single particle description is valid .",
    "also a small value of the @xmath91 parameter implies that one of the variables in the parameter space ( the charge into the stub ) becomes quasi discret .",
    "the pseudo single particle description exhibits a flux - nsensitive behaviour corresponding to a state localized at the stub , and a flux depending state that describes a mobile particle inside the ring . due to a change in the magnetic flux , when a charge goes from one part of the system to the other",
    ", a finit shift of the levels of each subsystem occurs due to the coulomb interaction together with a modification of the total spin of the ground state .",
    "it is the dependence of these levels with the state of charge , mainly in the stub but also in the ring , which drives the bistb ility .",
    "the system can reduce its onergy at @xmath46 changing its charge distribution , as shown in fig.3 .",
    "however , along an adiabatic path as analyzed above , these two states of charge are separated in phase space by a potential barrier which vanishes for a particular external magnetic flux @xmath92 when the transition occurs . at these values of the flux the energy of the total system changes discontinuously .    in this example",
    ", the bistability is unfavoured by the small value of the parameters @xmath93 . for greater values of @xmath22 , in order to obtain an interchange of charge between the ring and the stub , it is necessary to produce energy variations that go beyond the range allowed by the magnetic flux .",
    "so , in this case the gate potential is the relevant variable that controls the phenomenology of the system . in fig.4",
    "the dependence of the current on @xmath84 is presented for @xmath94 .",
    "for this value of @xmath91 the interchange of charge of the two subsystems permits the existence of regions where the current in the ring is caused by a fractional number of electrons.there are regions in which the charge is almost constant while in others it is highly dependent upon the gate potential .",
    "there , the behaviour the total spin of the ground state can change as it occurs at @xmath95 and @xmath96 in fig .",
    "4 . associated with it a bistability appears , as discussed above .    for a 1-d dbh the coulomb blockade effect reflects that , as soon as one electron enters the well region , the entrance of a second one is excluded simply because it has to overcome the coulomb repulsion produced by the first electron already inside it . here",
    "the coulomb blockade phenomenon is an intra - site effect .",
    "an electron can not flow because another one is already occupying the region through which it has to go to become an electrical carrier .",
    "in our case , there is an inter - site coulomb blockade effect produced by the repulsion that the charge inside the stub exercises over the flowing electrons within the ring in the nearby of the stub .",
    "this is reflected in a reduction of the current in the regions where the charge is stable , independent of @xmath84 , in comparison with the current that corresponds to a perfect ring with the same state of charge .",
    "in conclusion we have presented a study of the many body problem of an inhomogeneous closed ring enclosing a magnetic flux .",
    "we have shown that these systems have a bistable behaviour that can be associated to the physics of a non - linear system .",
    "we have also studied the effect that the imperfection has upon the persistent current flowing along the ring showing coulomb blockade effect between the stub and the ring .",
    "the development of sub - micrometer physics makes it possible to construct this sort of devices .",
    "we hope the predicted phenomenology could be a motivation for experimentalists to look for it in real systems .",
