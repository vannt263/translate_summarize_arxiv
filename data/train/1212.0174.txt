    "there are problems where the behavior of orbits in a compact phase space is determined by the dynamics of a system generated by the lift map on the universal cover .",
    "the classical one is a classification of rotation of the circle by using the poincar rotation number .",
    "such problems possess space - temporal features , where the universal cover serves as `` the space '' .",
    "one can study average speed of diffusion , transport properties , etc , and relate them to the dynamics on the original compact phase space . +",
    "this approach was profitable enough in the past and , as seems to us , is far from being completely exhausted .",
    "our article follows this way",
    ". we shall exploit notion of the @xmath1-separability introduced by kolmogorov and tikhomirov @xcite in the context of @xcite . a notion of space - time window introduced in @xcite for cellular automata and used in @xcite for lattice dynamical systems we apply here for maps on @xmath2 that are lifts for maps of the circle of degree @xmath0 .",
    "if such a map generates the dynamical system with non - zero topological entropy then , very often , it has a rotation interval different from a single point .",
    "it implies the existence of trajectories with different rotation numbers , i.e. with different spatio - temporal features .",
    "we suggest here to measure the amount of trajectories with a given rotation number using the notion of a directional entropy . roughly speaking",
    "if @xmath3 is a subset of a the circle such that the trajectories going through @xmath3 have the rotation number , say , @xmath4 , then the @xmath5-complexity of @xmath3 behaves asymptotically ( @xmath6 ) as @xmath7 .",
    "we call the number @xmath8 the directional entropy in the direction @xmath9 . the greater @xmath8 the greater the rate of instability manifested by trajectories with the rotation number @xmath4 .",
    "but one has to be careful",
    ". it can happen ( and occurs for mixing systems ) that for any fixed rotation number @xmath4 inside the rotation interval the set of initial points , say @xmath10 , corresponding to this rotation number is dense in the circle .",
    "so , the topological entropy on @xmath10 coincide with the topological entropy of the whole system . to avoid it we approximate @xmath10 by sets of initial points which",
    "trajectories stay in a space - time window , calculate the entropy on this window , and obtain @xmath8 as the limit of these entropies .    in this article",
    "we study mainly piecewise affine markov maps of the circle . for such maps it is possible to replace the calculation of the @xmath5-complexity by that of the symbolic complexity of some subsets of a corresponding topological markov chain ( tmc ) .",
    "the tmc is determined by the markov partition of the circle and the subsets  by the admissibility condition formulated according to the value of the rotation number .",
    "after that the problem becomes purely combinatorial .",
    "we use the approach of @xcite adjusted for our situation to obtain the explicit formulas for @xmath11 .",
    "the formulas depend only on the entries of the transition matrix of the tmc and on the weights of the edges of the corresponding oriented graph , where the weights are determined by the markov partition and the lift map .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_def ]",
    "we give the definitions of the directional complexity and the directional entropy @xmath11 . in section  [ sec_rot ]",
    "we show that @xmath12 only if @xmath4 belongs to the rotation interval . in section  [ sec_pie ] we define piecewise affine markov maps and show how to calculate the @xmath5-complexity in terms of symbolic dynamics .",
    "section  [ sec_com ] is devoted to the description of the combinatorial machinery . in section  [ sec_imp ]",
    "we describe a specific example where all can be explicitly seen . in section  [ sec_mea ]",
    "we construct some invariant probabilistic measures for which measure theoretical entropies coincide with the directional entropies . by using this",
    "we show that the topological entropy coincides with a directional entropy for some specific direction .",
    "we present a formula for this direction .",
    "section  [ sec_con ] contains some concluding remarks .",
