    "the statistical mechanics of systems with long - range interactions has recently attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "typical systems with long - range interactions include self - gravitating systems @xcite , two - dimensional vortices @xcite , non - neutral plasmas @xcite , free electrons lasers @xcite and toy models such as the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite . unusual properties of systems with long - range interaction such as negative specific heats or ensembles inequivalence have been evidenced and linked with lack of additivity @xcite .",
    "in addition , a striking property of these systems is the rapid formation of quasi stationary self - organized states ( coherent structures ) such as galaxies in the universe @xcite , large scale vortices in geophysical and astrophysical flows @xcite or quasi - stationary states in the hmf model @xcite .",
    "these qsss can be explained in terms of statistical mechanics using the theory developed by lynden - bell @xcite for the vlasov equation or by miller @xcite and robert & sommeria @xcite for the 2d euler equation .",
    "two - dimensional vortices interact via a logarithmic potential .",
    "interaction of vortices in 3d turbulence is weaker than in 2d turbulence , but still long - range . due to",
    "dissipative anomaly and vortex stretching , statistical mechanics of 3d turbulence has so far eluded theories .",
    "recent progress was recently made considering 3d inviscid axisymmetric flows @xcite that are intermediate between 2d and 3d flows : they are subject to vortex stretching like in 3d turbulence , but locally conserve a scalar quantity in the ideal limit , like in 2d turbulence .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study whether these systems obey the peculiarities observed in other systems with long - range interactions such as violent relaxation , existence of long - lived quasi - stationary states , negative specific heats and ensembles inequivalence .",
    "the general study of the stability of axisymmetric flows , and the possible occurrence of phase transitions , is difficult due to the presence of an infinite number of casimir invariants linked with the axisymmetry of the flow . in a previous paper @xcite , hereafter paper i ,",
    "we have considered a simplified axisymmetric euler system characterized by only three conserved quantities : the fine - grained energy @xmath0 , the helicity @xmath1 and the angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "we have developed the corresponding statistical mechanics and shown that equilibrium states of this system have the form of beltrami mean flows on which are superimposed gaussian fluctuations .",
    "we have shown that the maximization of entropy @xmath3 at fixed helicity @xmath1 , angular momentum @xmath2 and microscopic energy @xmath0 ( microcanonical ensemble ) is equivalent to the maximization of free energy @xmath4 at fixed helicity @xmath1 and angular momentum @xmath2 ( canonical ensemble ) .",
    "these variational principles are also equivalent to the minimization of macroscopic energy @xmath5 at fixed helicity @xmath1 and angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "this provides a justification of the minimum energy principle ( selective decay ) from statistical mechanics .",
    "we have furthermore discussed the analogy with the simplified thermodynamical approach of 2d turbulence developed in @xcite based on only three conserved quantities : the fine - grained enstrophy @xmath6 , the energy @xmath7 and the circulation @xmath8 .",
    "we have shown that equilibrium states of this system have the form of beltrami mean flows ( linear vorticity - stream function relationship ) on which are superimposed gaussian fluctuations .",
    "we have shown that the maximization of entropy @xmath3 at fixed energy @xmath7 , circulation @xmath8 and microscopic enstrophy @xmath6 ( microcanonical ensemble ) is equivalent to the maximization of grand potential @xmath9 at fixed energy @xmath7 and circulation @xmath8 ( grand microcanonical ensemble ) .",
    "these variational principles are also equivalent to the minimization of macroscopic enstrophy @xmath10 at fixed energy @xmath7 and circulation @xmath8 .",
    "this provides a justification of a minimum enstrophy principle ( selective decay ) from statistical mechanics . in the analogy between 2d turbulence and 3d axisymmetric turbulence",
    ", the energy plays the role of the enstrophy .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study more closely the equilibrium states of axisymmetric flows and explore their stability .",
    "we show that all critical points of macroscopic energy at fixed helicity and angular momentum are _ saddle points _ , so that they are unstable in a strict sense .",
    "indeed , there is no minimum ( macroscopic ) energy state at fixed helicity and angular momentum ( either globally or locally ) because we can always decrease the energy by considering a perturbation at smaller scales .",
    "this is reminiscent of the richardson energy cascade in 3d turbulence .",
    "inversely , in 2d turbulence , there exists minimum enstrophy states that develop at large scales ( inverse cascade ) .",
    "therefore , our system is intermediate between 2d and 3d turbulence : there exists equilibrium states in the form of coherent structures ( that are solutions of a mean field differential equation ) like in 2d turbulence , but they are saddle points of macroscopic energy and are expected to cascade towards smaller and smaller scales like in 3d turbulence .",
    "however , we give arguments showing that saddle points can be robust in practice and play a role in the dynamics . indeed , they are unstable only for some particular ( optimal ) perturbations and can persist for a long time if the system does not spontaneously generate these perturbations .",
    "therefore , these large - scale coherent structures can play a role in the dynamics and they have indeed been observed in experiments of von krmn flows @xcite . in order to make this idea more precise , we have explored their stability numerically using phenomenological relaxation equations derived in @xcite .",
    "we have found some domains of robustness in the parameter space .",
    "in particular , the one cell structure is highly robust for large values of the angular momentum @xmath11 and becomes weakly robust for low values of the angular momentum . in that case",
    ", we expect a phase transition ( bifurcation ) from the one - cell structure to the two - cells structure .",
    "we have also found that the value of the critical angular momentum @xmath12 changes depending whether we use relaxation equations associated with a canonical ( fixed temperature ) or microcanonical ( fixed microscopic energy ) description . at low temperatures",
    "@xmath13 , we have evidence a new kind of `` ensembles inequivalence '' characterizing the robustness of saddle points with respect to random perturbations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ computation ] .",

    "[ analytics ] where we show analytically that all states are unstable with respect to large wavenumber perturbations .",

    "we explore numerically the robustness of the equilibria in both canonical and microcanonical ensembles in sec .",

    "our numerical method is probabilistic and rather involved .",
    "a discussion of our results is done in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] where a bifurcation scenario relevant to the turbulent experimental von krmn flow is suggested .",
    "we consider a system with a cylindrical geometry enclosed in the volume delimited above and below by surfaces @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and radially by @xmath16 . like in paper",
    "i , we consider an axisymmetric euler - beltrami system characterized by a velocity field @xmath17 , with axisymmetric time averaged @xmath18 .",
    "we furthermore assume that the only relevant invariants of the axisymmetric euler equations for our problem are the averaged energy @xmath19 , the averaged helicity @xmath20 and the averaged angular momentum @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "we introduce the potential vorticity @xmath23 and the stream function @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they are related to each other by the generalized laplacian operator @xmath27 in actual turbulent von krmn experiments , we have been able to observe that the largest part of the kinetic energy is contained in the toroidal motions .",
    "it is therefore natural , as a first elementary step , to consider a model in which only toroidal fluctuations are considered , and suppose that the fluctuations in the other ( poloidal ) directions are simply frozen .",
    "with such an assumption , poloidal vorticity fluctuations are allowed , but toroidal vorticity fluctuations are excluded .",
    "we therefore only include a fraction of the vorticity fluctuations , that presumably become predominant at small scale , due to the existence of vortex stretching .",
    "as shown below and in the next paper @xcite , this simplification however still allows for vortex stretching and energy cascades towards smaller scales , and leads to predictions that are in good agreement with experiments .",
    "moreover , our hypotheses lead to a model that is self - contained and analytically tractable . according to our hypotheses ,",

    "@xmath35 the helicity and the angular momentum are _ robust constraints _ because they can be expressed in terms of coarse - grained quantities @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "by contrast , the energy is a _ fragile constraint _ because it can not be expressed in terms of coarse - grained quantities .",
    "indeed , it involves the fluctuations of angular momentum @xmath38 .",
    "to emphasize that point , we have introduced the notation @xmath39 to designate the fine - grained ( microscopic ) energy .",
    "splitting @xmath40 into a mean part @xmath37 and a fluctuating part @xmath41 , we define the coarse - grained ( macroscopic ) energy by @xmath42 then , the energy contained in the fluctuations is simply @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the local centered variance of angular momentum .",
