    "<S> we solve the yang - mills equations in the framework of the mclerran - venugopalan model for small times @xmath0 after a collision of two nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic expansion around @xmath1 leads to explicit results for the field strength and the energy momentum tensor of the gluon field at early times . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss constraints for the energy density , pressure and flow of the plasma phase that emerges after thermalization of the gluon field .    </S>",
    "<S> the color glass condensate ( cgc ) model @xcite has provided valuable tools to understand the interaction of hadrons and nuclei at very high energies . </S>",
    "<S> the idea that the rapid growth of the gluon distribution at high energy is tamed by gluon recombination leads to a saturated gluon density described by a saturation scale @xmath2 . due to the high occupation numbers the gluons can be approximated by a classical field @xcite . in high energy </S>",
    "<S> nuclear collisions the gluon density in each nucleus is enhanced by a factor @xmath3 and it has been argued that the cgc can describe the initial particle production at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .    here , we discuss what can be learned about the energy and momentum deposited in the space between the two receding nuclei immediately after the collision . this is an important question because there is convincing evidence that relativistic hydrodynamics governs the evolution of the fireball starting at rather early times @xmath4 fm/@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma phase , given by an energy momentum tensor @xmath6 emerges through a rather rapid and not yet completely understood thermalization process from the initial gluon field after overlap , described by an energy momentum tensor @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our goal here is to constrain the energy density @xmath8 , pressure @xmath9 and flow velocity @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) at the beginning of the plasma phase , using the cgc model in its version first conceived by mclerran and venugopalan ( mv ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have to solve the yang - mills equations @xmath12 = j^\\nu$ ] for a current @xmath13 created by infinitely thin color charge distributions @xmath14 and @xmath15 propagating on the plus and minus light cone , respectively , and overlapping at time @xmath16 . in light cone gauge the field of each nucleus before the collision , @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , ( @xmath19 ) , is transverse . in the forward light cone , i.e. after the collision , the field has light cone components @xmath20 and transverse components @xmath21 . @xmath22 and @xmath21 are functions of the proper time @xmath23 and the transverse position @xmath24 , but not of the space - time rapidity @xmath25 .    for small times </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 , immediately after the collision , the yang - mills equations in the forward light cone can be rewritten using an expansion in powers of @xmath0 , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting infinite tower of differential equations can be solved recursively to arbitrary order in @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> explicit solutions for @xmath27 and the field strength @xmath28 up to order @xmath29 have been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest order in @xmath0 ( @xmath30 ) coincides with the familiar boundary conditions for the field on the light cone . </S>",
    "<S> they imply that at the earliest time , for @xmath31 , strong longitudinal electric and magnetic fields between the nuclei , @xcite @xmath32 , \\qquad b_z = - ig \\epsilon^{ij } [ a_1^i , a_2^i],\\ ] ] dominate . </S>",
    "<S> this was also observed , e.g. , in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the next order in @xmath0 corresponds to a linear build - up of transverse fields .    </S>",
    "<S> one can now compute the energy momentum tensor of the gluon field . </S>",
    "<S> the leading terms @xmath30 at small time are the diagonal elements @xmath33 ( @xmath19 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 denotes the energy density at @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that @xmath36 in the mclerran - venugopalan model suffers from a ultraviolet divergence @xcite . in lattice calculations </S>",
    "<S> this divergence is regularized by the finite lattice spacing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can argue that this divergence comes from the fact that the ultraviolet sector of the initial particle production with large momenta @xmath37 is not perfectly described in the mv model which works best for @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we can choose a cutoff @xmath39 and replace the classical field above @xmath39 with a quantum but weak coupling description known to be well - behaved in this regime , i.e.  perturbative qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> at order @xmath40 the components describing transverse flow of energy receive their leading contributions @xmath41 with the transverse flow vector @xmath42 ( @xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will see below that this translates directly to the existence of transverse flow in the plasma phase immediately after thermalization .    </S>",
    "<S> further corrections to the components of @xmath43 up to order @xmath44 can be easily computed . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a rather accurate picture of the energy momentum tensor at times @xmath45 . at @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> the expansion might fail , however the asymptotic behavior for @xmath47 is known from a weak coupling expansion @xcite and an interpolation can be used for intermediate values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this reproduces the time dependence of numerical solutions of the yang - mills equations , see e.g.  @xcite .    in any case , the classical field approximation is not expected to hold for very large times anyway . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the field is expected to decay on a time scale @xmath48 , maybe through instabilities in the color fields @xcite or particle production in the background gluon field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is widely assumed , though not proved , to lead to a thermalized plasma within a rather short time .    </S>",
    "<S> one can , however , use energy and momentum conservation to estimate the energy momentum tensor of the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the thermalization is sufficiently rapid around a time @xmath49 so that the system can be approximately described by @xmath50 for @xmath51 , and by @xmath52 for @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> . then one can show that @xmath54 ( @xmath19 ) using the first two terms in the @xmath0 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> these four equations relate the five parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the plasma phase with components of the energy momentum tensor of the field . </S>",
    "<S> the system of equations can be closed by providing an additional constraint , e.g. an equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be used as an initial condition for a hydrodynamic evolution of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly discuss this result . </S>",
    "<S> first we notice that we recover boost - invariance for the longitudinal flow velocity @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , as mentioned before , there is initial radial flow @xmath56 in the plasma phase which is directly proportional to the energy flow @xmath57 of the field . for collisions with finite impact parameter </S>",
    "<S> this also implies the existence of elliptic flow .    </S>",
    "<S> the results presented so far are functions of the single nucleus fields @xmath58 and have to be evaluated by putting the correct expressions for those fields . </S>",
    "<S> they have been discussed in the literature , see e.g. @xcite . in @xcite estimates were presented in an abelianized approximation in which the non - abelian effects were mimicked by color screening at a typical distance @xmath59 . to be precise , </S>",
    "<S> the screening radius @xmath60 at a given point in the transverse plane was chosen to to be @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number density of color charges in the nucleus @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation reproduces the gluon two - point function @xmath63 @xcite quite well . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect this approximation to give a good estimate of the energy momentum tensor , since it has been shown that @xmath36 depends on @xmath58 solely through this two - point function @xcite . using this scheme one finds very simple formulae for the center of two very large nuclei colliding head - on , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a numerical constant and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 are the number densities of charges in the two nuclei , which lead to the @xmath68 color densities @xmath69 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the dependence of the results on the ( unphysical ) cutoff @xmath39 . the ( physical ) saturation scale @xmath70 is independent of @xmath39 as it should be , while the initial energy density @xmath36 ( @xmath71 in the plot ) grows with @xmath39 . for a rather reasonable value @xmath72 gev </S>",
    "<S> the estimated initial energy density is roughly @xmath73 gev/@xmath74 .    </S>",
