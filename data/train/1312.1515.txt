    "there is a lot of interest in the study of non - perturbative systems , which can not be solved by exploiting the existence of a small expansion parameter . in this paper",
    "we discuss two formalisms that have been proposed to address non - perturbative problems : @xmath0-particle irreducible ( @xmath0pi ) effective theories , and the exact renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "the @xmath0pi formalism has been used to study finite temperature systems and non - equilibrium dynamics ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "the exact rg has been applied to a variety of problems @xcite .",
    "we show that the 4pi effective action produces two bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equations that can be used to truncate the rg flow equations at the level of the second equation , and that the resulting flow equations for the 2- and 4-point functions are total derivatives whose integrals give the 4pi eom s .",
    "this result is surprising ( since the full hierarchy of rg flow equations are obtained using a single bi - local source term ) , and suggests that a bs truncation at arbitrary orders produces equations whose integrals give the @xmath0pi eom s .",
    "we work with a scalar field theory with quartic coupling and consider only the symmetric case where the expectation value of the field is zero .",
    "we use a compactified notation in which the space - time coordinates are represented by a single numerical subscript .",
    "we also use an einstein convention in which a repeated index implies an integration over space - time variables .",
    "the @xmath0pi effective action is obtained by taking the @xmath0th legendre transform of the generating functional which is constructed by coupling the field to @xmath0 source terms of the form @xmath1 .",
    "the effective action has the form @xmath2 +      \\frac{i}{2 } { \\rm tr } \\,{\\rm ln}g^{-1 }   + \\frac{i}{2 } { \\rm tr}\\left [ \\left(g^0\\right)^{-1 } g\\right ] -i\\phi_2 \\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 contains all contributions which have two or more loops .",
    "for example , @xmath3 for the 4-loop 4pi effective action in the symmetric theory @xcite is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : phiaandb-2 ] .     for the 4-loop 4pi",
    "effective action .",
    "[ fig : phiaandb-2],width=264 ]    the self consistent propagator and vertex are obtained through the variational principle by solving the equations produced by taking the functional derivative of the effective action and setting the result to zero .",
    "we define kernels : @xmath4 the factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 indicate the number of @xmath7 s and @xmath8 s with respect to which the functional derivative is taken .",
    "the inverse propagators truncate the legs that are left behind by the functional derivatives with respect to @xmath8 , and they are moved through the derivative in ( [ lam0nl ] ) only so that the equation is easier to write - functional derivatives do not act on legs by definition .",
    "the definition of the kernel @xmath9 also excludes a disconnected piece that contains only inverse propagators .",
    "it is well known that the 2pi effective action gives a bs equation for a diagonal 4-point function .",
    "writing the effective action as a functional of the form @xmath10 $ ] we obtain : @xmath11 calculating the derivative gives @xmath12 substituting ( [ gderr2 ] ) into ( [ side1 ] ) and using the kernel definition ( [ lam0nl ] ) produces : @xmath13    higher order bs equations are calculated the same way @xcite . using the 4pi effective action ( [ side1 ] ) becomes : @xmath14 the method used to obtain ( [ gderr2 ] ) gives : @xmath15\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and combining pieces we obtain the result in the first line of fig .",
    "[ fig : bs - combo ] .    , width=529 ]    similarly we obtain a bs equation for a 6-point function from @xmath16 : @xmath17 substituting the derivatives and kernels gives , after a long calculation , the second line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs - combo ] @xcite .",
    "the rg is constructed by building a family of theories indexed by a continuous parameter @xmath18 , with the dimension of a momentum , such that fluctuations are smoothly taken into account as @xmath18 is lowered from the microscopic scale @xmath19 ( at which the couplings are defined ) down to zero .",
    "we add to the original action a non - local term which is quadratic in the fields @xmath20 : @xmath21 the function @xmath22 approaches zero for @xmath23 , so that modes @xmath24 are unaffected , and @xmath25 for @xmath26 , which suppresses modes @xmath27 by giving them a mass @xmath28 . generating functionals are defined in the usual way but with the action @xmath29 replaced by @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 functionally differentiating ( [ gkappa - def ] ) with respect to @xmath34 produces the exact rg flow equations which form an infinite coupled hierarchy .",
    "the first two flow equations are ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : renormgroup ] ) : @xmath35 the factor ( 6 ) in eq .",
    "( [ flow2 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : renormgroup ] is a short - hand notation which means that there are 6 permutations of external legs .",
    "we use numerical factors in brackets in equations ( figures ) to represent additional terms that correspond to permutations of external indices that are not written ( drawn ) .    ) and ( [ flow2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig : renormgroup ] , width=377 ]    in order to do calculations , the infinite hierarchy of rg flow equations must be truncated .",
    "this is a common feature of non - perturbative methods , and often leads to difficulties ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the hierarchy of rg flow equations can be truncated at the level of the first equation using the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation derived from the 2pi effective action @xcite .",
    "we can perform the truncation at the 4pi level using the bs equations in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs - combo ] .",
    "we extend these equations to the deformed theory by using kernels obtained from functional derivatives of the 4pi effective action which are subsequently evaluated at @xmath36 .",
    "diagrammatically , we substitute the bs equations in fig . [",
    "fig : bs - combo ] into the tadpole diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : renormgroup ] . after a long calculation",
    "this produces the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig:22truncation-4pi ] and [ fig : bs24truncation - all ] @xcite .",
    "we represent the sum of terms @xmath37 by a small grey dot ( red on - line ) .",
    "is substituted into the tadpole diagram in the first part of fig .",
    "[ fig : renormgroup ] .",
    "[ fig:22truncation-4pi],width=226 ]     is substituted into the tadpole diagrams in the second part fig .",
    "[ fig : renormgroup ] .",
    "[ fig : bs24truncation - all],width=302 ]    we compare our results for @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the derivatives @xmath40 and @xmath41 using the 4pi equations of motion extended to the deformed theory .",
    "@xmath42 equation ( [ sigma-4pi - b ] ) is precisely the result that is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:22truncation-4pi ] if we identify @xmath43 , which means we have @xmath44 for the 4-point function a similar calculation gives @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 equations ( [ 2result ] ) and ( [ 4result ] ) show that the rg equations for the 2- and 4-point functions are total derivatives whose integrals can be written as the 4pi equations of motion .",
    "we have shown that the bs truncation produces flow equations that are total derivatives with respect to the flow parameter , and that the integrals of the flow equations give the equations of motion of the 4pi effective theory .",
    "this establishes a direct connection between two non - perturbative methods . for the @xmath0pi formalism",
    ", there could be a practical advantage in reformulating the integral equations as flow equations , because initial value problems are usually easier to solve than non linear integral equations .",
    "furthermore , regarding the vertices from the @xmath0pi effective theory as flow equations gives new insight into the problem of how to renormalize the @xmath0pi effective theory for @xmath46 .",
