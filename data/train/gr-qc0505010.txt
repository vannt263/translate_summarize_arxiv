    "the question of symmetry inheritance is concerned with determining when the symmetries of geometry ( defined through the existence of symmetry vectors ) are inherited by the source terms or individual physical components of the energy - stress tensor ( related to the geometry via einstein field equations ) .",

    "m generated by a conformal killing vector ( ckv ) @xmath2 if @xmath3 where @xmath4 signifies the lie derivative along @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the conformal factor .",

    "the study of the groups of motions in spacetime is interesting because it can lead to the discovery of conservation laws . on the other hand , from a geometrical point of view studies like these",
    "can be used to device spacetime classification schemes .",
    "thus , the study of inheritance symmetries with ckv s and sckv in fluid spacetimes ( perfect , anisotropic , viscous and heat - conducting ) has recently attracted some interest .",
    "herrera @xcite have studied ckv s , with particular reference to perfect and anisotropic fluids ; maartens @xcite have made a study of ckv s in anisotropic fluids , in which they are particularly concerned with special conformal killing vector ( sckv ) ; coley and tupper @xcite have discussed spacetimes admitting sckv and symmetry inheritance .",
    "carot @xcite have discussed spacetimes with conformal killing vectors .",
    "also , duggal @xcite have discussed curvature inheritance symmetry and timelike ricci inheritance symmetry in fluid spacetimes .    the study of cosmic strings has aroused considerable interest as they are believed to give rise to density perturbations leading to the formation of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the existence of a large scale network of strings in the early universe is not contradiction with present day observations of the universe @xcite .",
    "also , the present of strings in the early universe can be explained using grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study the symmetry features of strings .",
    "recently , work on symmetries of the string has been taken yavuz and yilmaz @xcite , and yilmaz @xcite who have considered inheriting conformal and special conformal killing vectors , and also curvature inheritance symmetry in the string cosmology ( string cloud and string fluids ) , respectively .",

    "a subcase of ci is the well - known symmetry `` curvature collineation '' ( cc ) when @xmath16 . in the sequel",
    ", we say that ci is proper if @xmath17 .",
    "the metric and curvature symmetries play important roles in mathematics and physics .",
    "for example , in general relativity , the einstein field equations being highly non - linear , most explicit solutions are obtained by assuming killing vectors .",
    "curvature collineations are important as their existence leads to the existence of a cubic first integral of a mass particle with geodesic trajectories and moreover , the fundamental identity of komar ( which serves as a covariant generator of field conservation laws in general relativity ) appears as an essential necessary condition for a cc @xcite .",
    "if a @xmath1 admits a ci , then the following identity holds ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 i.e. , @xmath2 defines ricci inheritance symmetry .    identity ( [ eq3 ] ) implies that every civ @xmath20 is also riv .",

    "equation ( [ eq6 ] ) serves as the basis for generating solutions for a variety of fluid spacetimes .",
    "as the ricci tensor has important role in spacetimes , we assume that spacetimes with string cloud and string fluid admit a spacelike riv @xmath25 satisfying equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
