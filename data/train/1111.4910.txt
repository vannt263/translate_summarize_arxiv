    "plasmonics and polaritonics @xcite may be the most promising candidates in the race of novel ultrafast technologies which have the potential to reach the application border @xcite .",
    "meta - materials or plasmonic systems @xcite are on the border to be engineered for ultrafast electronic switches @xcite , and ultrashort laser science opens the door to their exploration @xcite .",
    "however discussing picosecond , femto or attosecond time scales the framework of equilibrium physics reaches it s limits .",
    "when we talk about ultrafast nonlinear processes in commercially fabricated metallic or organic structures , impurities naturally play a key role for the efficiency and the proper operation of such devices .",
    "they may either disturb the process or may play the key role of access to new technologies .",
    "another fascinating track of physics in the context of ultrafast switches are beyond doubt quantum - optical functional elements @xcite .",
    "yet the combination of both , highly nonlinear nonequilibium physics and quantum optics is an ansatz which has not been felt out in a broad range up to now .",
    "solid - state - based elements , provide a number of advantages such as scalability , tunable light - matter interactions and comparably easy handling . besides its immense technological importance , the theoretical description of externally driven quantum systems is a challenge itself , and vividly discussed @xcite . while the basic underlying equilibrium physics for a system with discrete levels coupled to a continuum of states is well established @xcite , the profound description of light - matter interaction far away from thermodynamical equilibrium is an active and fascinating area of research .",
    "in this article the electronic properties of gold ( au ) nano - grains exposed to an external field are investigated and they are coupled to a single mode photonic silicon - on - insulator hollow core waveguide ( soi ) . in this non - equilibrium system , the external time - periodic field generates photo - induced electronic side - bands which can be attributed to the franz - keldysh effect , the ac analogon to the well known wannier - stark effect .",
    "intraband transitions occuring in every metal within the conduction band feature a more or less small absorbtion rate , whereas the governing processes are the interband transitions . in au a significantly different behavior has been found , which has been attributed to the electronic specific structure of closed packed au , namely to the high polarizability of the @xmath0 cores . the collective resonance exhibits a large red shift to approximately @xmath1 which leads to the fact that the corresponding intensity is governed by the interband processes but its existence results from the occurence of intraband transitions which can be recognized as step like strutures in the spectrum .",
    "these transitions , which result from a non fermi alike distribution of states , have been observed by whetten _",
    "et al._@xcite , for au nano - spheres of diameters below @xmath2 .",
    "their occurence has been interpreted as the border from bulk like characteristics to the quantum regime of nano particles .",
    "the transitions within this single plasmon band provide the basis for the switching effect .",
    "we show that the bandstructure of the coupled system of au nano - grains and soi is strongly modified by intense external laser radiation ( fig.[fig_4 ] ) , which can be tested experimentally e.g. by two photon photoemission ( 2ppe ) .",
    "frequency and amplitude of the external field can be seperately used to modulate the position in energy of the floquet - side - bands and , therefore sensitively control the generation of a fano - resonance with the photonic soi mode .",
    "the calculated lifetimes of the coupled states prove the extremely fast switching .",
    "as theoretical setup the frhlich hamiltonian @xcite for fermion - boson interaction is chosen which is solved by applying the keldysh formalism with respect to the non - equilibrium character of the considered processes on the femto - second time scale .",
    "the full hamiltonian reads @xmath3    this article is organized as follows , we consider ( i ) the waveguide in contact with nano - grains , ( ii ) the nano - grain in the external field and finally ( iii ) discuss the non - equilibrium solution of the complete system in terms of electronic keldysh - green s function and waveguide transmission .",
    "the overall switching is measured as the difference between density of electronic states of the totally unaffected system compared to the setup including all effects due to the external laser light and as a consequence the coupling to the waveguide mode .",
    "we start with the single electron band with nearest - neighbor hopping , characterized by the hopping amplitude @xmath4 , with the dispersion for a cubic lattice for the ion cores @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the lattice constant and @xmath7 are the components of the wave - vector .",
    "we assume a soi waveguide supporting a single mode @xmath8 .",
    "the waveguide itself is coated and therefore not exposed to the external laser field .",
    "the electrons couple with strength @xmath9 weakly to waveguide photons with frequency @xmath10 .",
    "a possible setup is depicted in fig.[fig_00 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian without the external laser field reads , @xmath11 we assume the spatial extension of the au nano - grains to be smaller than @xmath12 , and consequentially small compared to the wavelength of the photonic mode inside the waveguide .",
    "therefore , the momentum of the photons is much smaller than the electron s momentum and we can set @xmath13 whenever we consider the electronic subsystem .",
    "thus , @xmath14 ( @xmath6 ) does not carry an index in the hamiltonian . in eq .",

    "@xmath20 is the photon energy eigen - state , where @xmath14 ( @xmath6 ) creates ( annihilates ) a photon inside the waveguide with energy @xmath21 .",
    "the last ( coupling ) term on the r.h.s . is the standard coupling term between the electronic and the photonic subspaces @xcite . due to the weak interaction of waveguide photons and electrons inside the nano - grains we treat this interaction perturbatively . in second order",
    "a self - energy contribution is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ hamilton_we ] ) .",
    "the coupling of the electronic system with a continuous energy spectrum to the photons with a discrete one leads to a so - called fano resonance @xcite .",
    "this is observed in the electronic density of states ( see fig.[full ] ) .",
    "here we show the electron s spectral function for various frequencies of the waveguide mode for coupling strength @xmath22 at zero temperature for a spectral width @xmath23 of the waveguide mode ( measured in units of the hopping @xmath4 ) at half filling , yielding a suppression of the spectral function around the fermi - level ( half width @xmath24 ) where electrons are transferred to the high ( low ) energy tails of the spectral function .",
    "we note , that if the energy of the waveguide mode @xmath25 is distinctly different from the energy @xmath26 of the band - electrons , the electronic density of states remains approximately unchanged .",
    "now we discuss the subsystem of a nano - grain exposed to a semiclassical electromagnetic laser field .",
    "this is described by the hamiltonian ( lb = laser + band - electrons )    @xmath27    where @xmath28 implies summation over nearest neighbores .",

    "it is given by @xmath33    [ 0.5 ]    the hamiltonian specifically describres the excitation of a plasmon - polariton , which correspond to spatially delocalized intraband electronic motion caused by an external electromagnetic wave . the accelerating energy is immediately transferred into the motion of electrons by means of single - band nearest neighbor hopping without interaction between the electrons . due to the time dependence of the external field , green s functions truly depend on two separate time arguments .",
    "therefore , we use a double fourier transform from time- to frequency space introducing relative and center - of - mass frequency  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 label the floquet modes @xcite and @xmath36 specify on which branch of the keldysh contour ( @xmath37 ) the respective time argument resides .",
    "floquet states are the fouriertransformed analog to bloch states : the first ones result from a time - periodic potential whereas the latter are the result of a space - periodic potential and both induce a band - structure . the special case of non - interacting electrons allows an analytical solution for @xmath38 by solving the equation of motion .",
    "including photo - induced hopping , the exact retarded green s function for this sub - system has also been discussed in different context e.g. @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 represents the dispersion relation induced by the external field eq .",
