    "recently the bes collaboration in the radiative decay @xmath8 observed a sharp enhancement at threshold in the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum@xcite .",
    "they , further based on a multi - quark bound state conjecture , tried to fit the enhancement by means of an s - wave breit - wigner resonance function , and obtained the resultant mass peak at @xmath10(stat)@xmath11(sys ) mev and width @xmath12 less than 30 mev . in the meanwhile ,",
    "belle also reported their observations that in the decays @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite , an enhancement in the @xmath15 invariant mass distribution near the threshold was also seen clearly .",
    "theoretical investigations of baryon - antibaryon bound states date back to the proposal of fermi and yang@xcite to make the pion with a nucleon - antinucleon pair .",
    "the extensive and excellent reviews are given in ref @xcite .",
    "in traditional nuclear interaction theories within the potential framework which are based on the single meson exchange mainly , it is shown that @xmath16-system is more attractive than @xmath17-system due to the fact that in the theories there is a strong @xmath18-exchange .",
    "therefore possible bound states or resonances of a nucleon - antinucleon system ( the so - called nuclear baryonia ) have been proposed for many years .",
    "recently being encouraged by the observations and with intuition , several interpretations on the observations near and below the baryon - antibaryon threshold were suggested : ( i ) based on the fact that the radiative @xmath5 decay may be a gluon - rich process , l. rosner@xcite explained the enhancement is due to the iso - scalar state with @xmath19 being coupled to a pair of gluons ; ( ii ) b.s .",
    "zou et al with a k - matrix approach @xcite summed up the one - pion - exchange final state interaction and showed an important contribution to make the enhancement behavior near the threshold ; ( iii ) many phenomenological models were used to explain this anomalous ( sharp ) enhancement as a bound state or a resonance , e.g. , a. datta et al @xcite accounted it for a new bound state in a simple potential model with a @xmath20 confining interactions ; x .- g . he et al@xcite also gave their explanation by using linear @xmath21 model .",
    "the traditional interaction theories to study @xmath22 system , such as boundary condition model , absorptive potential model , optical model and coupled - channel models etc , specially put forward their own method to handle the short - range part of @xmath23 , although in comparatively long range they are quite similar . for instance , the optical model @xcite provides a realistic picture of the scattering process by introducing an imaginary part of the potential to reproduce the effect of other excitation channels , and the spin - isospin dependence of meson - exchange and channel dependence in the annihilation potential as well are also taken into account .",
    "the coupled - channel model either describes annihilation in terms of baryon exchange with the same baryon - meson coupling as in the yukawa potential @xcite or uses semi - phenomenological potential adding partial - wave - analysis to study @xmath24 interaction@xcite .",
    "although the agreement with collision experiments is obtained , from the qcd point of view each of them has shortcoming respectively .",
    "for example , it is hard to imagine that a baryon - exchange picture can be applied to such a short - range where quarks are ` overlapped ' and the color octet configuration must be considered .",
    "in fact , the early studies within the traditional meson exchange ( mesons exchange between the nucleons as whole ) framework found that , if neglecting annihilation channels i.e. taking the real part of the effective potential only , many bound states might be formed , while annihilation effects i.e. the imaginary part of the potential , were included , the binding force decreased and some bound states were washed out @xcite . moreover , in the earlier days experimentally the data there was no clear evidence to imply the existence of strongly bound states .",
    "therefore , we suspect that the bound state should be tight i.e. the two components have great overlapping , if a pair of @xmath24 really form a bound state as indicated by bes and belle experiments , i.e. , the picture with meson - exchanges between the ` whole ' nucleons to describe the interaction may not contain all of the key effects , at least , the behavior of @xmath24 interaction in short - range should be re - considered carefully with a novel way .",
    "a possible way out for the tight bound state problem is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental strong interaction physics .",
    "namely we should start with the quark level , rather than that of the baryon level .",
    "qcd has been already proved to be the right approach at high energy . at low energy , because of the non - perturbative nature of qcd , one has to rely on effective theories underlining qcd and/or qcd - inspired models to get some insight into the phenomena of the hadronic world .",
    "the constituent quark model is one of them .",
    "it has achieved a lot of successes in describing spectrum for single baryon , the baryon - baryon interactions and the binding of two baryons such as the nucleus deuteron , even having found possible strong binding of @xmath25 systems @xcite etc .",
    "therefore , expanding the constituent quark model into @xmath23 system is an interesting tentative .",
    "in fact , in order to fitting all of the data from single baryon spectrum to interactions between two baryons , in literature the constituent quark model has variety versions . in this paper",
    ", to study of the possibility of @xmath26 bound states as indicated in @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 decays within the framework of resonating group method , we take a variety chiral quark model , which may fit the data of single baryon and deuteron etc . besides including @xmath30 , @xmath21 and one - gluon exchange , in the concerned model ,",
    "we take into account the contributions from the annihilations of a pair quarks into a meson accordingly and into one gluon as well . in order to keep the model well - described for baryon spectrum and @xmath17 scattering data ,",
    "all of the model parameters have been fixed as possible as those related to @xmath17 interaction and baryon spectrum etc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derived the formalism , then gave the hamiltonian and wave function , after that , gave a brief summary about resonating group method , which is used to do dynamical calculation .",
    "in section iii , we show the results and gave discussion .",
    "we think the basis of the constituent quark model for light flavor systems would be better to set on effective chiral quark model ( with necessary extensions ) of qcd .",
    "namely the dynamics should be described by the effective chiral quark lagrangian ( pseud - goldstone particles and light quarks as active degrees of freedom in the theory ) @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33\\,.\\ ] ]    since at present we consider the @xmath0 system , so for the lagrangien we restrict ourselves to consider two flavors only . as mentioned in introduction , in order to fit nuclear data some ` modification ' on the quark chiral model is needed , such as to add a scalar @xmath21 ` meson ' @xcite and a ` survived ' effective gluon into the model etc .",
    "thus with the modification the relevant quark - gluon - meson lagrangian can be re - written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes quark field , and @xmath36 are the constituent quark masses .",
    "current masses turns to constituent masses accordingly is a consequence of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "@xmath37 is the vertex coupling ( quarks to mesons ) constant and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is an index of color space and @xmath40 is gell - mann matrix for @xmath41 color ) @xmath42 is gluon field . to study the baryon structure and baryon - baryon interaction , the survived gluon field @xmath42 is introduced so as to take care of the necessary non - perturbative contributions in the model .",
    "in addition , to provide the non - perturbative qcd effects at long distance , an effective confinement in potential is needed .",
    "we will discuss them later .",
    "the effective potential derived from the ` exchange ' between quarks has been considered by many authors such as those of refs.@xcite , now we should consider those derived from the exchange and annihilation between quark and antiquark .      according feynman rule ,",
    "the t - matrix of @xmath21-exchange between quark and anti - quark can be written as @xmath43 here , we have inserted a form factor @xmath44 to cut off the contributions from the short - distance region where the chiral symmetry has not broken . generally , it takes the form @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 are the four - vector momenta and spin @xmath47-projections of initial quark and final quark , respectively .",
    "@xmath48 are the four - vector momenta and spin @xmath47-projections of initial antiquark and final antiquark , respectively . @xmath49 and @xmath50 are assumed to be free dirac spinors for quarks and antiquarks , respectively , but soon in the paper we will replace them by two component pauli spinors for convenience because of the non - relativistic nature for the problem .    when we take the non - relativistic limit to turn the dirac spinors to pauli ones , there is an additional minus sign from the interchange of the effective interaction @xmath51 to the @xmath52 so it cancels the extra fermion minus sign .",
    "therefore the @xmath21-exchange potential is universally attractive , no matter between a pair of fermions or between a pair of antifermions ( or a pair of each ) .",
    "the @xmath21-exchange potential between quarks or quark - antiquark in the nonrelativistic problem in coordinate space can been written as @xmath53\\ , .",
    "\\label{(eq8)}\\ ] ]    as for the @xmath30-exchange , since it has a different sign when taking non - relativistic limit from dirac spinors to pauli ones for the effective interactions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so there is an additional minus sign from fermion - fermion into fermion - antifermion in taking the limit .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2-m_\\pi^2 } ( \\overrightarrow{\\sigma_i } \\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\sigma_j } ) ( \\overrightarrow{\\tau_i } \\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\tau_j})\\ , ; \\nonumber\\\\ v^{\\pi}_{qq}&=&\\frac{1}{12}\\frac{g^2_{ch}}{4\\pi } \\frac{m^2_\\pi}{m_{q_i}m_{q_j}}[\\frac{e^{-m_\\pi r}}{r}-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{m^2_\\pi } \\frac{e^{-\\lambda r}}{r } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2-m_\\pi^2 } ( \\overline{\\sigma_i } \\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\sigma_j})(\\overrightarrow{\\tau_i } \\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\tau_j})\\ , . \\label{(eq9)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that the additional minus may be understood by the g - parity rule easily .",
    "here @xmath57 is a pauli matrix for spin and @xmath58 is a pauli matrix for isospin .",
    "since it is not allowed any quark - antiquark exchange between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , so the interaction from one - gluon - exchange for @xmath2 and @xmath3 is very different that for the @xmath59 system that one - gluon - exchange between @xmath2 and @xmath3 does not contribute to the effective potential at all .",
    "here we only write down the potential due to one - gluon exchange between two quarks ( antiquark ) in one baryon ( antibaryon)@xcite , @xmath60\\,.\\label{(eq10)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]              since we are taking into account the contributions of the lowest order to the ` full ' @xmath1-wave at this step , i.e. , we consider the ` full ' @xmath1 wave cases ( all of the quarks and antiquarks are in @xmath1-wave ) , so under static approximation the contributions from @xmath21-meson ( @xmath63 ) annihilation ( @xmath64-wave annihilation ) to the potential in the present case ( for @xmath1-wave states ) are tiny .",
    "thus we omit them here .",
    "the contributions from one - gluon annihilation to the potential between quark and anti - quark in momentum representation can be written as @xmath65 here @xmath66 ( in 4-dimension ) in the propagator .",
    "we follow the chiral quark model for multi - quark systems @xcite , which essentially is an effective theory on exchanges of goldstone mesons , scalar meson @xmath21 and gluons as well between quarks , but we extend it to antiquarks involved , so as to study the nucleon - antinucleon system with definite isospin ( i ) and spin ( s ) .    as the first step and to the conjecture of bes collaboration @xcite , here only s - wave states of the nucleon pair are considered , i.e. , the total orbital angular momentum @xmath72 , and we have @xmath73 ( the total angular momentum comes from quark spin only ) .",
    "the most parameters are fixed by fitting baryon spectrum of the model@xcite : the coupling constant @xmath74 is fixed by @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath74 is related to @xmath76 directly by @xmath77 , ( @xmath78 are the masses of pion and nucleon , respectively ) , the one - gluon - exchange coupling constant @xmath79 is determined by mass splitting of @xmath80 and @xmath2 , the confinement strength @xmath81 is fixed by the stability conditions of @xmath2 , @xmath82 is fixed by the masses of @xmath2 . in summary , the parameters in the model are listed in table i. the units for @xmath83 and @xmath81 are mev , fm and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "if the attraction of the effective potential is deep enough for forming bound states , we further do dynamical calculations in the framework of resonating group method exactly , and finally obtain corresponding relative motion wave functions and the mean square roots of the radius as well for the states .",
    "from fig.5 we may see that @xmath21 exchange gives a universally attractive interaction for a nucleon and antinucleon system as it does for a nucleon - nucleon system . as stated before , the contributions from @xmath21 annihilation to the @xmath1-wave nucleon and antinucleon system is small , so we omit it .",
    "@xmath30 annihilation gives repulsion interaction for all concerned cases with different strength , the contribution to @xmath85 is the largest , while the contribution to @xmath86 is the smallest .",
    "one - gluon annihilation also provides rather repulsion for these four considered states , especially , for the states @xmath87 .",
    "( it seems that the contribution from the gluon annihilation should not be omitted when studying nucleon - antinucleon interaction , unless coupling constant of gluon annihilation is much smaller than that of gluon exchange . )",
    "@xmath30 exchange is the main factor to cause the differences for these four states .",
    "it provides repulsion for the state @xmath88 ( and a minor attraction in the long range ) but attraction for states @xmath89 , that is opposite to the case for nucleon - nucleon systems .     and @xmath21-exchange , @xmath30-annihilation and one - gluon annihilation for the states @xmath90 .",
    "square points denote the contribution from gluon annihilation , circle ones for pion annihilation , up - triangle ones for pion exchange and down - triangle ones for @xmath21 exchange.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   and @xmath21-exchange , @xmath30-annihilation and one - gluon annihilation for the states @xmath90 .",

    "the observation by bes collaboration presents a strong enhancement in the decay @xmath94 , that imply the quantum numbers of the @xmath95 state , if it is in s - wave , are @xmath96 or @xmath97 but not @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "when dropping the annihilation contributions , it is clear in table iii that the state with quantum numbers @xmath85 has a larger attractive interaction than that with @xmath100 , that is consist with the bes collaboration observation . with the increasing of annihilation coupling constant ,",
    "the difference of theses two cases will emerge .    in summary , in this paper",
    "we extend to apply the chiral constituent quark model with quark - meson - gluon - degrees of the freedom to the nucleon - antinucleon systems with quantum numbers @xmath101 ; @xmath102 ; @xmath103 ; @xmath104 . our results with the original model parameters as we can show the facts as below :",
    "\\(a ) for the @xmath86 ( @xmath1-wave ) system , the repulsion from @xmath30-exchange is so strong that it can cancel the attraction from @xmath21-exchange .",
    "no matter we adopt the annihilation coupling constant for the model in a reasonable range , there is no bound state at all .",
    "\\(c ) by dynamical calculations we show that the bound states with @xmath106 for an @xmath1-wave nucleon and antinucleon system may be exist if the annihilation coupling constant @xmath93 is suppressed for certain reason appropriately . for instance , if letting @xmath107 for @xmath108 , one may obtain a ` tightly bound state ' at e=1877.80 mev and @xmath109 ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "if we had dropped the annihilation contributions at all , except @xmath110 , in the other three cases ( @xmath111 ) the nucleon and antinucleon system might be bound tightly within a size not greater than @xmath112 fm .",
    "moreover , the binding energy of the @xmath113 and @xmath114 states would be several tens of mev greater than that of the state @xmath115 and the mean squared root of the radius of the @xmath100 would be a little larger than that of @xmath116 etc .    in the early 1990s ,",
    "dover et al@xcite constructed @xmath117 potential model from the @xmath59 effective potential by g - parity transformation accordingly , and predicted lower - lying isospin i=0 natural - parity @xmath118 bound states and a few isospin i=1 states , such as @xmath119 , also .",
    "their predictions are consistent with our results , if one compare those of an @xmath1-wave nucleon and antinucleon system only .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are so many similarities qualitatively , although dover s model and ours are based on very different level , especially , to deal with the short - range behavior of @xmath120 in a very different way in the two approaches ( in dover approach , an arbitrary square - well cutoff is applied for the unknown short - range behavior of @xmath120 potential ) .",
    "finally , we should note here that this work is very preliminary in studying the nucleon - antinucleon interaction in the framework of constituent quark model .",
    "there are quite a lot of factors for the nucleon - antinucleon interaction which should be investigated carefully , especially , as a very strong assumption , we ignore the couple channel ( such as the multi - pion and other mesons being involved etc ) effects at all , although there are a lot of channels which should be considered @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the adopted resonating group method also should be tested thoroughly .",
    "even though , we still would like to emphasize that searching for the @xmath0 bound state with the quantum number @xmath121 through various multi - meson decay channels is crucial to confirm the multi - quark conjecture . even though considering our results and the bes observation , we would like to say that , if there is really an @xmath1-wave @xmath122 bound state , then its quantum number is likely to be @xmath85 . as a consequence , similar enhancements in the decays , such as @xmath123 and @xmath124 etc in belle and babar at b - factories , and such as @xmath125 etc in bes at bepc should be observed , although there are technical difficulties for the observations .      99 j.z .",
