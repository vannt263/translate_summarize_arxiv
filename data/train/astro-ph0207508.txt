    "rapid periodic oscillations are observed in the optical flux of high accretion rate ( `` high-@xmath8 '' ) cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ( nova - like variables and dwarf novae in outburst ) @xcite .",
    "these oscillations have high coherence ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) , short periods ( @xmath1140 s ) , low amplitudes ( @xmath12% ) , and are sinusoidal to within the limits of measurement .",
    "they are referred to as `` dwarf nova oscillations '' ( dnos ) to distinguish them from the longer period , low coherence ( @xmath1310 ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of high-@xmath8 cvs , and the longer period , high coherence ( @xmath14@xmath15 ) oscillations of dq  her stars .",
    "dnos appear on the rising branch of the light curve of dwarf nova outbursts , typically persist through maximum , and disappear on the declining branch of the light curve .",
    "the period of the oscillation decreases on the rising branch and increases on the declining branch , but because the period reaches minimum about one day after maximum optical flux , dwarf novae describe loops in plots of oscillation period versus optical flux .",
    "rapid periodic oscillations have been detected in the flux of numerous high-@xmath8 cvs , but the dwarf nova ss  cyg in outburst is one of the best studied .",
    "oscillations in the optical flux have been detected with periods ranging from 7.3 s to 11 s @xcite , and oscillations in the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) and soft x - ray flux have been detected with periods ranging from 2.8 s to 11 s in data from _ heao 1 _ , _ exosat _ , the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) , and _ rosat _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the euv oscillation period is a single - valued function of the euv flux , explained the loops observed in plots of oscillation period versus optical flux as the result of the delay between the rise of the optical and euv flux at the beginning of dwarf nova outbursts",
    "@xcite , and so provided strong evidence for the proposal , first mooted by @xcite , that the oscillation period depends solely on the mass - accretion rate onto the white dwarf .",
    "@xcite observed `` frequency doubling '' of the euv oscillation of ss  cyg during the rising branch of its 1996 october outburst , demonstrated that the optical and euv oscillation periods are equal , and that their relative phase delay is consistent with zero .    in this communication , we present an analysis of observations of ss  cyg in outburst obtained in 1994 june / july with the _ euve _ deep survey ( ds ) photometer and in 2001 january with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ low energy transmission grating spectrograph ( letgs ) . in ",
    "2 we present the observations and data analysis , finding that the euv flux was oscillating at frequencies @xmath0 hz and @xmath16 hz , while the soft x - ray flux was oscillating at frequencies @xmath2 hz , @xmath3 hz , and possibly @xmath17 hz . in  3 we discuss these results in the context of similar results from optical observations of the dwarf nova vw  hyi in outburst and x - ray observations of neutron star and black hole low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "as first pointed out by @xcite , white dwarf , neutron star , and black hole binaries share a common correlation in the frequencies of their qpos , extending over nearly five orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "the implications of this result for qpo models are discussed , we discuss how additional observations of cvs can provide unique and quantitative tests of qpo models , and close in  4 with a summary .",
    "our pre - approved target - of - opportunity _ chandra _ low energy transmission grating ( letg ) and high resolution camera ( hrc ) observation of ss  cyg was performed between 2001 january 16 @xmath18 and january 17 @xmath19 ut during the plateau phase of a wide normal ( asymmetric ) dwarf nova outburst that began on january 12 .",
    "when the observation began , ss  cyg had been at maximum optical light ( @xmath20 ) for approximately 3 days ; long enough , given the delay of 1.5 days between the rise of the optical and euv light curves of ss  cyg @xcite , for the euv / soft x - ray flux to have reached maximum and for the system to have reached a quasi - steady - state .",
    "indeed , the zero- and @xmath21 first - order letg / hrc count rates were observed to be roughly constant throughout the 47.3 ks observation at 1.5 and 4.9 @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the files used for this analysis were created on 2002 january 7 by the pipeline data reduction software using ciao 2.0 with asdcs version 6.5.1 .",
    "events were extracted from the level 2 evt file , and the mean spectrum and source and background region masks were extracted from the level 2 pha file .",
    "the mean letg spectrum contains two distinct components : ( 1 ) a hard component shortward of 40   consisting of a bremsstrahlung continuum and emission lines of h- and he - like c , n , o , ne , mg , and si and l - shell fe ( most prominently ) and ( 2 ) a soft component extending from 42   to 120   that appears to consist of a continuum significantly modified by a forest of emission and absorption features ( possibly even p  cygni profiles ) . in the 72120   wave band , the letg spectrum is essentially identical to that measured by the _ euve",
    "_ short wavelength ( sw ) spectrometer during the 1993 august @xcite and 1996 october @xcite outbursts of ss  cyg .",
    "these hard and soft components of the x - ray spectrum of ss  cyg are understood to be due to the optically thin and optically thick portions of the boundary layer between the disk and the surface of the white dwarf .    to investigate the temporal properties of the hard and soft x - ray flux of ss  cyg , we processed the @xmath23 first - order letg events as follows .",
    "first , we created a list of source and background events by filtering the events with the source and background region masks .",
    "second , we applied a wavelength filter that excluded events near the hrc chip gaps : for the positive order , events with wavelengths @xmath2467.5   were excluded , while for the negative order , events with wavelengths @xmath2557.2   were excluded . without this filter , a portion of the soft component of the spectrum moves on and off the hrc chips , and so produces signals in the power spectra at the spacecraft dither periods of 707 s and 1000 s. third , various wavelength cuts were applied to isolate the hard ( @xmath2642  ) component of the spectrum , the soft ( @xmath27120  ) component of the spectrum , and various subsets thereof ( see below ) .",
    "events passing these filters were used to create background - subtracted light curves with 1 s time resolution , and power spectra of these light curves were examined for evidence of periodic flux modulations .",
    "consistent with more sensitive searches by _ heao-1 _",
    "@xcite , _ asca _",
    "@xcite , _ ginga _",
    "@xcite , and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) @xcite , no periodic signal was detected in the hard x - ray light curves .",
    "in contrast , strong periodic signals were detected in the soft x - ray light curves : as shown in the upper panel of figure 1 , the power spectrum of the soft x - ray light curve shows excess power at frequencies @xmath28 hz and @xmath3 hz , indicating the presence of oscillations at periods @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s. to investigate these oscillations more closely , we divided the soft x - ray light curve into 47 consecutive 1 ks intervals and calculated their power spectra .",
    "although the individual power spectra are rather noisy , the @xmath31 hz oscillation typically appears as a single @xmath32 hz peak with a frequency in the range @xmath330.112 hz .",
    "the mean of these 47 consecutive 1 ks power spectra is shown in the middle panel of figure 1 .",
    "in addition to the peaks at @xmath2 hz and @xmath3 hz , there appears to be a shoulder on the higher - frequency peak extending to @xmath34 hz . to account for the observed frequency evolution , we scaled the frequency vectors of the 47 power spectra by the instantaneous frequency of the dominant @xmath35 oscillation .",
    "the mean of these scaled power spectra is shown in the lower panel of figure 1 .",
    "note that most of the power of the @xmath35 oscillation now lies in a single frequency bin , there is no excess power in the first harmonic @xmath36 or subharmonic @xmath37 ( i.e. , the dominant @xmath35 oscillation is sinusoidal to high degree ) , and the lower - frequency peak lies at @xmath38 .",
    "this is not the first time that multiple periodicities have been seen in the short wavelength flux of ss  cyg . in the power spectrum of the _ euve _ ds count rate light curve of the 1994 june / july outburst of ss  cyg , @xcite noted the presence of oscillations at @xmath39 hz , @xmath1 hz , and its first harmonic @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , he noted that the harmonic peak was present in data from only the first part of the observation , and suggested that the low - frequency peak is due to the spin of the white dwarf . to revisit these issues",
    ", we reexamined the ds data from the second part of the _ euve _ observation ( between 1994 june 29 @xmath40 and july 3 @xmath41 ut ) .",
    "background - subtracted light curves were derived from 37 15 ks orbits , 37 power spectra were calculated , and the mean power spectrum derived . as shown in the upper panel of figure 2 ,",
    "peaks in this power spectrum occur at frequencies @xmath0 hz and @xmath42 hz , indicating the presence of oscillations in the euv flux of ss  cyg at periods @xmath43 s and @xmath44 s. as before , we accounted for the observed frequency evolution from @xmath45 hz to 0.132 hz @xcite by scaling the frequency vectors of the 37 power spectra by the instantaneous frequency of the dominant @xmath35 oscillation .",
    "the mean of these scaled power spectra is shown in the lower panel of figure 2 .",
    "note that most of the power of the @xmath35 oscillation again lies in a single frequency bin , there is no excess power in the first harmonic @xmath46 or subharmonic @xmath37 ( i.e. , the dominant @xmath35 oscillation is sinusoidal to high degree ) , and the lower - frequency peak lies at @xmath47 .      before leaving this section",
    ", we note that it is possible to use the _ chandra _ letg data to investigate the energy dependence of the euv / soft x - ray oscillations of ss  cyg . while an  - by - investigation of the spectrum of the oscillations is beyond the scope of this paper , it is a simple matter to divide the letg soft x - ray bandpass in two .",
    "a division at @xmath48   would halve the counts from the soft component of the x - ray spectrum of ss  cyg , but instead we divided the counts at @xmath49   to approximate the bandpass of the _ euve _ ds .",
    "as before , we constructed background - subtracted light curves with 1 s time resolution , divided the light curves into 47 consecutive 1 ks intervals , calculated power spectra , and derived mean power spectra .",
    "the resulting mean power spectra for the @xmath5070   and @xmath49120   bandpasses are shown respectively in the upper and lower panels of figure 3 .",
    "this figure shows that in the softer @xmath49120   bandpass the @xmath51 hz and @xmath3 hz oscillations are slightly stronger , while in the harder @xmath2770   bandpass the shoulder on the @xmath3 hz oscillation appears to resolve into a distinct peak at @xmath52 hz .",
    "summarizing the results from the previous section , we have found that during the 1994 june / july _ euve _ observation of ss  cyg in outburst the euv flux was oscillating at frequencies @xmath0 hz and @xmath1 hz , while during the 2001 january _ chandra _ letg observation the soft x - ray flux was oscillating at frequencies @xmath2 hz , @xmath3 hz , and possibly @xmath53 hz .",
    "we note that because the frequency of the @xmath54 oscillation is not constant from 1994 to 2001 , it can not be due to the spin of the white dwarf , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "instead , the near - constancy of the ratio @xmath55 suggests that the @xmath54 oscillation is related to the dominant @xmath35 oscillation .    to place these results in a broader context",
    ", we note that other high-@xmath8 cvs have been observed to display multiple periodicities in their power spectra .",
    "first , @xcite list a number of instances in the literature when pairs of dnos have been detected in the optical flux of nova - like variables and dwarf novae in outburst .",
    "second , @xcite detected a pair of dnos at @xmath56 hz and @xmath57 hz in the optical continuum and balmer emission line flux of v2051 oph during its 1998 july outburst .",
    "although it was not possible to detect the difference frequency @xmath58 hz directly in the power spectrum ( d.  steeghs 2002 , personal communication ) , the amplitude of the oscillation varied considerably on a timescale equal to the inverse of the difference frequency ( 8 min ) . third , @xcite discuss a number of instances when multiple periodicities have been detected in the optical flux of vw  hyi in outburst . during the decline of the 2000 february outburst , dnos with periods @xmath5937 s and qpos with periods @xmath60580 s were detected simultaneously . the ratio @xmath610.071 , which is similar to the ratio observed in the euv and soft x - ray oscillations of ss  cyg .",
    "furthermore , in data from the 1972 november outburst of vw  hyi , three oscillations were detected simultaneously : a pair of dnos with periods @xmath62 s and @xmath63 s , and a qpo with a period @xmath64 s. the ratio @xmath65 and the difference frequency @xmath66 hz , which is close , but not equal , to the qpo frequency @xmath67 hz .",
    "having established these properties of the qpos of cvs , it is interesting to investigate their possible connection to the qpos of lmxbs .",
    "@xcite provides a comprehensive review of lmxb qpos , so it is sufficient to note here that among neutron star binaries , the luminous z sources have pairs of 2001200 hz `` kilohertz qpos , ''",
    "1560 hz `` horizontal branch oscillations '' ( hbos ) , and 520 hz `` normal branch oscillations , '' while the less luminous atoll sources have 5001250 hz kilohertz qpos , as well as 2060 hz qpos and broad noise components with properties that are similar to hbos .",
    "* hereafter pbk99 ) showed that in five z sources a tight correlation exists between the hbo frequency @xmath68 and the frequency @xmath69 of the lower - frequency member of the pair of khz qpos ( the `` lower khz qpo '' ) .",
    "specifically , when @xmath70 hz , @xmath71 furthermore , by identifying with @xmath68 and @xmath72 the frequencies of various types of peaked noise components in atoll sources , other neutron star binaries , and black hole binaries , pbk99 and subsequently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bpk02 ) extended this correlation over nearly three orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the optical data for vw  hyi in outburst lie on an extrapolation of this correlation , extending it an additional two orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "figure  4 shows that our euv and soft x - ray data for ss  cyg in outburst also lie on an extrapolation of this correlation , further establishing the connection between the cv and lmxb qpos .",
    "this connection identifies the dnos of cvs with the khz qpos of lmxbs , and the qpos of cvs with the hbos ( or the broad noise component identified as such ) of lmxbs .",
    "we note that the frequencies of the dnos of cvs and the khz qpos of neutron star binaries are similar in that they are comparable to the keplerian frequency @xmath73 at the inner edge of the accretion disk of , respectively , a white dwarf and neutron star : @xmath74 hz for a @xmath75 white dwarf with @xmath76 cm , while @xmath77 hz for a @xmath78 neutron star with @xmath79 km , as required by general relativity .",
    "in addition to their frequencies , the dnos of cvs and the khz qpos of neutron star binaries are similar in that they have relatively high coherence and high amplitudes , their frequency scales with the inferred mass - accretion rate , and they sometimes occur in pairs .      given the apparent connection between the qpos of white dwarf , neutron star , and black hole binaries , it is appropriate that we investigate the implications for the theories of qpo formation .",
    "in the beat - frequency models , qpos occur at the keplerian frequency @xmath80 at a special radius in the accretion disk , and the beat of this frequency with the stellar rotation frequency @xmath81 . in the magnetospheric beat - frequency model @xcite , the hbo frequency",
    "is identified with the beat frequency between the keplerian frequency at the magnetospheric radius @xmath82 and the stellar rotation frequency : @xmath83 . in the sonic - point beat - frequency model @xcite",
    ", some of the disk plasma makes its way past the magnetospheric radius to the `` sonic point '' radius @xmath84 where the disk is effectively terminated because of either radiation drag or general relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity . in this model , the upper khz qpo frequency is identified with the keplerian frequency at the sonic point radius : @xmath85 , and the lower khz qpo frequency is identified with ( one or two times ) the beat frequency between the keplerian frequency at the sonic point radius and the stellar rotation frequency : @xmath86 $ ] , where @xmath87 or",
    "2 . note that in this model , the stellar rotation frequency @xmath88 . in the relativistic precession model @xcite , the qpo signals are due to the fundamental frequencies of disk plasma orbiting a rapidly rotating compact star in slightly eccentric and tilted orbits . in this model , the upper khz qpo frequency is identified with the keplerian frequency : @xmath89 , the lower khz qpo frequency is identified with the periastron precession frequency : @xmath90 , and the hbo frequency is identified with the nodal precession frequency : @xmath91 .    how does the existence of qpos in white dwarf , neutron star , and black hole binaries constrain the theories of qpo formation ?",
    "first , as has been pointed out by other authors , the existence of qpos in both neutron star and black hole binaries excludes both flavors of the beat - frequency models ( as well as _",
    "any _ model requiring the presence or absence of a stellar surface or magnetic field ) .",
    "second , the dnos of cvs exclude the sonic - point beat - frequency model .",
    "first , there is no reason to expect a sonic point in the inner disk of a cv : @xmath92 and radiation drag is unimportant because the luminosity is a small fraction of the eddington rate ( @xmath93 ) and because the flow is only mildly relativistic ( @xmath94 ^{1/2}{{\\lower0.75ex\\hbox { $ < $ } \\atop\\raise0.5ex\\hbox { $ \\sim$ } } } 0.02\\ , c$ ] ) .",
    "second , in vw  hyi at least , the dno frequency separation is not equal to one or two times the white dwarf spin frequency . using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) goddard high resolution spectrograph , @xcite measured the projected rotation velocity of the white dwarf in vw  hyi in quiescence to be @xmath95 . with a binary inclination @xmath96 and a white dwarf mass @xmath97 ( hence @xmath98 ) , @xmath99 hz , whereas the dno separation frequency @xmath100 hz .",
    "third , the qpos and dnos of cvs exclude the relativistic precession model .",
    "first consider the nodal precession frequency , which is the sum of the relativistic ( lense - thirring ) precession frequency @xmath101 due to frame dragging around a rapidly rotating compact star and the classical precession frequency @xmath102 due to the quadrupole term in the gravitational potential of an oblate star . because @xmath102 is negative for prograde orbits , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the moment of inertia of the star . for a @xmath105 white dwarf , @xmath74 hz and @xmath106 , and since stability requires @xmath107 @xmath108 hz , whereas the observed cv qpo frequencies @xmath109 hz . next consider the periastron precession frequency , which is the difference between the keplerian and epicyclic frequencies .",
    "the latter term is @xmath110 to sufficient accuracy for a white dwarf accretor , so @xmath111{{\\lower0.75ex\\hbox { $ < $ } \\atop\\raise0.5ex\\hbox { $ \\sim$ } } } 10^{-3}$ ] hz , whereas the observed cv dno frequencies @xmath112 hz .    in summary , assuming that the same mechanisms produce the qpos in white dwarf , neutron star , and black hole binaries , we find that the data exclude the relativistic precession model and the magnetospheric and sonic - point beat - frequency models ( as well as _",
    "any _ model requiring the presence or absence of a stellar surface or magnetic field ) .",
    "more promising are models , such as the transition layer model of titarchuk and collaborators @xcite , that interpret qpos as manifestations of disk accretion onto any low - magnetic field compact object .",
    "the results from the previous sections suggest that there is a close relationship between the qpos of cvs and lmxbs , with the dnos of cvs being the analogues of the khz qpos of lmxbs and the qpos of cvs being the analogues of the hbos ( or the broad noise component identified as such ) of lmxbs .",
    "the proposed equivalence of cv dnos and lmxb khz qpos strengthens the commonly - held belief that the frequency of the khz qpos is equal to the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disk because ( 1 ) the frequency ratio @xmath113 and ( 2 ) in every case the dno frequencies are consistent with the requirement that @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "the proposed equivalence of cv dnos and lmxb khz qpos on one hand and cv qpos and lmxb hbos on the other hand can be strengthened by finding more cvs with pairs of dnos and more cvs in which dnos and qpos are observed simultaneously .",
    "conversely , systems known to show only qpos could be searched more carefully for dnos .",
    "a interesting candidate is the dwarf nova u  gem in outburst , whose @xmath115  hz qpo @xcite implies the existence of @xmath116  hz ( 2 s ) dnos ( an oscillation period shorter than the integration times typically employed to search for optical oscillations ) . for the keplerian frequency to be this high",
    ", the mass of the white dwarf in u  gem must be quite high : @xmath117 , assuming the @xcite white dwarf mass - radius relation .",
    "this requirement is consistent with the white dwarf mass derived by @xcite ( @xmath118 ) , but is inconsistent with the values derived by @xcite ( @xmath119 ) and @xcite ( @xmath120 ) .    aside from filling in the lower - left corner of figure 4 ,",
    "additional observations of cvs are warranted because they provide unique and quantitative tests of qpo models .",
    "data can be obtained from the ground in the optical and from space in the ultraviolet , euv , and soft x - rays ; the system parameters ( binary inclination , white dwarf mass , radius , and rotation velocity ) can be measured ; eclipse mapping in edge - on systems allows the sites of flux modulations to be located and dissected ; dwarf nova outbursts provide a dramatic and systematic variation in the mass - accretion rate ; diagnostic emission lines are available from the optical through soft x - rays , and general relativistic affects are minimal .",
    "furthermore , technological improvements now allow _ spectroscopic _ observations of the flux oscillations of cvs .",
    "@xcite used the keck low resolution imaging spectrograph ( @xmath1219200   ) in continuous readout mode to study the dnos in the optical continuum and balmer line flux of the eclipsing dwarf nova v2051 oph in outburst .",
    "@xcite used the _ hst _ faint object spectrograph with the g160l ( @xmath1222510   ) grating to study the wavelength dependence of the ultraviolet dnos of the eclipsing dwarf nova oy  car in outburst . @xcite used the _ hst _ space telescope imaging spectrograph in time - tag mode with the e140h ( @xmath1231690   ) echelle grating to study the ultraviolet dnos of ss  cyg in outburst , while @xcite used the _ euve _ sw spectrometer to study the wavelength dependence of the euv dnos of ss  cyg in outburst .",
    "such observations shed new light on the qpos of cvs and lmxbs .",
    "we have shown that during the 1994 june / july _ euve _ observation of ss  cyg in outburst the euv flux was oscillating at frequencies @xmath124 hz and @xmath1 hz , while during the 2001 january _ chandra _ letg observation the soft x - ray flux was oscillating at frequencies @xmath2 hz , @xmath3 hz , and possibly @xmath125 hz .",
    "these data , combined with the optical data of @xcite for vw  hyi , extend the pbk99 and bpk02 @xmath5@xmath126 correlation for neutron star and black hole lmxbs nearly two orders of magnitude in frequency , with @xmath127 .",
    "this correlation identifies the dnos of cvs with the khz qpos of lmxbs , and the qpos of cvs with the hbos ( or the broad noise component identified as such ) of lmxbs . assuming that the same mechanisms produce the qpos in white dwarf , neutron star , and black hole binaries",

    "<S> using data obtained in 1994 june / july with the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ deep survey photometer and in 2001 january with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ low energy transmission grating spectrograph , we investigate the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) and soft x - ray oscillations of the dwarf nova ss  cyg in outburst . </S>",
    "<S> we find quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at @xmath0 hz and @xmath1 hz in the euv flux and at @xmath2 hz , @xmath3 hz , and possibly @xmath4 hz in the soft x - ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> these data , combined with the optical data of woudt & warner for vw  hyi , extend the psaltis , belloni , & van der klis @xmath5@xmath6 correlation for neutron star and black hole low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) nearly two orders of magnitude in frequency , with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation identifies the high - frequency quasi - coherent oscillations ( so - called `` dwarf nova oscillations '' ) of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) with the kilohertz qpos of lmxbs , and the low - frequency qpos of cvs with the horizontal branch oscillations ( or the broad noise component identified as such ) of lmxbs . assuming that the same mechanisms produce the qpos in white dwarf , neutron star , and black hole binaries </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the data exclude the relativistic precession model and the magnetospheric and sonic - point beat - frequency models ( as well as _ </S>",
    "<S> any _ model requiring the presence or absence of a stellar surface or magnetic field ) ; more promising are models that interpret qpos as manifestations of disk accretion onto any low - magnetic field compact object . </S>"
