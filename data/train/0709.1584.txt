    "a qcd sum - rule calculation of hadron parameters @xcite involves two steps : ( i ) one calculates the operator product expansion ( ope ) series for a relevant correlator and obtains the sum rule which relates this ope to the sum over hadronic states , and ( ii ) one extracts the parameters of the ground state by a numerical procedure .",
    "each of these steps leads to uncertainties in the final result .",
    "the first step lies fully within qcd and allows a rigorous treatment of the uncertainties : the correlator in qcd is not known precisely ( because of uncertainties in quark masses , condensates , @xmath0 , radiative corrections , etc . ) , but the corresponding errors in the correlator may be systematically controlled ( at least in principle ) .",
    "the second step lies beyond qcd and is more cumbersome : even if several terms of the ope for the correlator were known precisely , the hadronic parameters might be extracted by a sum rule only within some error , which may be treated as a systematic error of the method .",
    "it is useful to recall that a successful extraction of the hadronic parameters by a sum rule is not guaranteed : as noticed already in the classical papers @xcite , the method may work in some cases and fail in others ; moreover , error estimates ( in the mathematical sense ) for the numbers obtained by sum rules may not be easily provided  e.g. , according to @xcite , any value obtained by varying the parameters in the sum - rule stability region has equal probability . however , for many applications of sum rules , especially in flavor physics",
    ", one needs rigorous error estimates of the theoretical results for comparing theoretical predictions with the experimental data .",
    "systematic errors of the sum - rule results are usually estimated by varying the borel parameter and the continuum threshold within some ranges and are believed to be under control .",
    "in this letter we concentrate on the systematic errors of hadron parameters obtained by a typical svz sum rule . to this end , a quantum - mechanical harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential model is a perfect tool : in this model both the spectrum of bound states ( masses and wave functions ) and the exact correlator ( and hence its ope to any order ) are known precisely .",
    "therefore , one may apply the standard sum - rule machinery for extracting parameters of the ground state and test the accuracy of the extracted values by comparing with the known exact results . in this way the accuracy of the method may be probed . for a detailed discussion of many aspects of sum rules in quantum mechanics",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the essential features of the qcd calculation , let us consider a non - relativistic model with a potential containing both a coulomb and a confining part , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath1 the polarization operator @xmath2 is defined by the full green function @xmath3 as follows : @xmath4 the full green function satisfies the lippmann ",
    "schwinger operator equation @xmath5 which may be solved by constructing the expansion in powers of the interaction @xmath6 : @xmath7 respectively , for the polarization operator @xmath2 one may construct the expansion shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] .",
    "if the confining potential is known , one can calculate each term of the expansion . if one does not know the confining potential precisely , an explicit calculation is not possible . in this case",
    "one can explicitly calculate the contribution @xmath8 of those diagrams which do not contain the confining potential ( first line in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] ) and parametrize other diagrams , in which the confining potential appears , taking into account the symmetries of the theory . in qcd",
    "such diagrams are parametrized in terms of condensates and radiative corrections to them .    in what follows",
    "we make a further simplification of the model and switch off the coulomb potential , which we , in principle , know how to deal with .",
    "we shall retain only the confining potential , choose it as the ho potential @xmath9 and study @xmath10 [ the borel transform of the polarization operator @xmath2 ] , which gives the evolution operator in the imaginary time @xmath12 : @xmath13 for the ho potential ( [ 1.1 ] ) , the exact analytic expression for @xmath10 is known @xcite : @xmath14    the expansion of the polarization operator @xmath2 in powers of the interaction : wavy lines ( green ) represent the coulomb - part exchange , dashed lines ( red ) represent the confining - part exchange.,width=377 ]    expanding this expression in inverse powers of @xmath15 , we get the ope series for @xmath10 : @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and higher coefficients may be obtained from ( [ piexact ] ) .",
    "each term of this expansion may be also calculated from ( [ pie ] ) and ( [ ls ] ) , with @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath18 .    the `` phenomenological '' representation for @xmath10 is obtained by using the basis of hadron eigenstates of the model , namely , @xmath19 with @xmath20 the energy of the @xmath21th bound state and @xmath22 ( the square of the leptonic decay constant of the @xmath21-th bound state ) given by @xmath23 for the lowest states , one finds from ( [ piexact ] ) @xmath24    now , imagine we know @xmath10 numerically and want to extract the parameters of the ground state @xmath25 and @xmath26 . at large values of the euclidean time @xmath12 the polarization operator is dominated by the ground state .",
    "therefore , one has a plateau in @xmath27 and in the product @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] ) . in practice ,",
    "working at sufficiently large values of @xmath12 , one constructs @xmath27 and , after verifying that the plateau has already been reached , determines @xmath25 .",
    "then one studies @xmath29 and reads  off  @xmath26 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      strictly speaking , a constant effective continuum threshold @xmath30 is incompatible with the sum rule .",
    "nevertheless , this ansatz may work well , especially in our model : as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , the exact @xmath31 is almost flat in the fiducial interval .",
    "therefore , the ho model represents a very favorable situation for applying the qcd sum - rule machinery .",
    "now , one needs to impose a criterion for fixing @xmath32 .",
    "a widely used procedure is the following @xcite : one calculates @xmath33 which now depends on @xmath15 due to approximating @xmath31 by some constant .",
    "then , one determines @xmath34 and @xmath32 as the solution to the system of equations @xmath35 yielding @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) , and a good central - value estimate @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being extremely stable in the fiducial range .",
    "note , however , a dangerous point : ( i ) a perfect description of @xmath10 with better than 1% accuracy , ( ii ) the deviation of @xmath40 from @xmath25 at the level of only 1% , and ( iii ) extreme stability of @xmath41 in the full fiducial range leads to a 4% error in the extracted value of @xmath39 ! clearly , this error could not be guessed on the basis of the other numbers obtained , and it would be wrong to estimate the error , e.g. , from the range covered by @xmath39 when varying the borel parameter @xmath15 within the fiducial interval .",
    "let us summarize the lessons we have learnt :    \\1 .",
    "the knowledge of the correlator in a limited range of the borel parameter @xmath15 is not sufficient for an extraction of the ground - state parameters with a controlled accuracy : rather different models for the correlator in the form of a ground state plus an effective continuum lead to the same correlator .",
    "the procedure of fixing the effective continuum threshold by requiring the average mass calculated with the cut correlator to reproduce the known ground - state mass @xcite is not restrictive : a @xmath15-dependent effective continuum threshold @xmath31 , obtained as a solution of the sum rule ( [ fit ] ) , leads to the cut correlator ( [ cut ] ) which automatically ( i ) reproduces exactly @xmath42 for all values of the borel parameter @xmath15 , and ( ii ) yields a @xmath15-independent value of @xmath39 which , however , may be rather far from the true value .    \\3 . modeling the hadron continuum by a _",
    "constant _ effective continuum threshold allows one to determine its value @xmath32 by , e.g. , requiring the average energy @xmath43 to be close to @xmath25 in the stability region . in the model under discussion ( where the exact effective continuum threshold is , in fact , almost constant ) one obtains in this way a good estimate @xmath38 , with practically @xmath15-independent @xmath39 .",
    "the unpleasant feature is that the deviation of @xmath39 from @xmath26 turns out to be much larger than the variations of @xmath43 and @xmath39 over the fiducial range .",
    "therefore , the systematic errors can not be estimated by looking at the variation of @xmath39 within the fiducial domain of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we conclude that in those cases where the continuum contribution is not known ( which is a typical situation encountered , e.g. , in analyses of heavy - meson observables ) the standard procedures adopted in a qcd sum - rule extraction of hadron parameters do not allow to control the systematic uncertainties .",
    "consequently , no systematic errors for hadron parameters obtained with sum rules can be provided .",
    "let us emphasize that the independence of the extracted values of hadron parameters from the borel mass does  not guarantee the extraction of their true values .",
    "nevertheless , in the model under consideration the sum rules give good estimates for the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "this may be due to the following specific features of the model : ( i ) a large gap between the ground state and the first excitation that contributes to the sum rule ; ( ii ) an almost constant exact effective continuum threshold in a wide range of @xmath15 . whether or not the same good accuracy may be achieved in qcd , where the features mentioned above are absent , is not obvious and requires more detailed investigations .",
    "one of the possible ways could be the application of different versions of sum rules to the same observable ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "presently , this shortcoming  the impossibility to control the systematic errors  remains the weak feature of the method of sum rules and an obstacle for using the results from qcd sum rules for precision physics , such as electroweak physics .",
    "decays and provided many predictions for form factors of weak decays of @xmath44 mesons @xcite . however , assigning rigorous errors to these predictions could not be done so far . ]",
