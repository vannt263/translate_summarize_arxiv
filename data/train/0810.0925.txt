    "the knowledge of nucleon distribution in finite nuclear systems is a relevant topic in nuclear physics since it is not only important in characterizing the spatial extent of the nucleus but it is related to other issues like , for example , the location of the nucleon drip - lines  @xcite or the determination of nuclear masses in the r - process nucleosynthesis in the astrophysical context  @xcite .",
    "a variety of approaches have provided with nuclear mass formulae that allow testing properties of currently available nuclei from experiment  @xcite .",
    "both non relativistic density - dependent skyrme  @xcite and gogny interactions  @xcite and relativistic mean field ( rmf ) calculations  @xcite have been largely used as they provide a successful reproduction of charge distribution and size of nuclei .",
    "other many - body techniques like monte carlo , classical molecular dynamics , antisymmetrized molecular dynamics or even more elaborate as the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo have the potentiality of being applied to this type of calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of direct simulation of clusterized matter in systems such as the outer crust of neutron stars or supernova matter these techniques are not suitable . due to the nature of these intensive calculations",
    "it is usual to construct nuclear interaction models in a way so that they will retain the essential physics involved , yet they keep as simple as possible for saving cpu time .    in exploratory works",
    "@xcite we used monte carlo techniques to study nuclear binding energies and nuclear density distributions for iso - symmetric spin saturated medium mass nuclei with nucleon number up to @xmath1 using semiclassical simulations via monte carlo many - body techniques . in @xcite the purpose was to study the role of an effective pauli potential dependent on density parameterized by one nuclear variable , the fermi momentum of the constituent nucleons for nuclei with a up to @xmath2 . in this semiclassical simulation of a finite nucleon system",
    "it was demonstrated that the empirical binding energies for these nuclei can be reproduced satisfactorily even if one uses a simplified nn interaction provided a density dependent pauli potential is included . in that case",
    "a delicate counterbalance of kinetic and potential energy contributions arises allowing for the nuclear saturation mechanism .",
    "in particular , only isospin and additionally spin dependence in the nn interaction sector was included to size the impact on binding of ( anti ) alignement of nucleon spins .",
    "obtained results show that this latter improvement in the description of the interaction weakly impacts the reproduction of experimental nuclear binding energies .",
    "in @xcite we considered a wider range of nuclei with @xmath3 for spin - isospin saturated @xmath4 ( even z and n ) nuclei .",
    "we showed that as the nucleon fermi momentum is no longer a good parameter due to the fact that the average fermi momenta in nuclei with @xmath5 saturate to a value @xmath6 mev / c ( e.g. , @xmath7 mev / c for a @xmath8pb nucleus )  @xcite , and additional dependence must be considered in order to parametrize fermionic correlations .",
    "this result , then , generalizes the previous conclusion that the density dependence of the pauli potential is crucial to reproduce the empirical nuclear binding energies  @xcite .",
    "if heavier systems are explored , one obtains that for systems with nucleon number @xmath9 larger than @xmath10 the binding energies per particle and pauli potential strength contribution stabilizes and the corresponding binding energy per particle for symmetric nuclear matter at low temperatures of @xmath11 mev is obtained .",
    "as mentioned , in this type of semiclassical simulations one considers effective degrees of freedom under the form of nucleons . in this sense",
    "this treatment is appropriate to the interaction range of @xmath12 ( or energies of the order of the pion mass @xmath13 mev ) in an analogous way to the very successful effective field theories ( eft ) used in hadronic physics  @xcite .",
    "other type of nuclear systems of interest in fields such as nuclear astrophysics can be considered in this simulation scenario . clustered configurations arising in low density neutron star matter , below densities @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and known as _ pasta phase _",
    "@xcite can be studied using this approach , beyond the usually adopted wigner - seitz cell approximation that lacks the inclusion of higher order correlations  @xcite . in simulations of heavy - ion collisions",
    "the fragmentation yields at late times show that the final mass distribution of clusters is a relevant topic that largely depends on higher order correlations in the simulations  @xcite .    from the experimental point of view",
    "there is an increasing effort in the experimentation with radioactive beams such as , among others , isolde  @xcite , those at riken  @xcite or the proposed ria  @xcite and fair  @xcite .",
    "special attention is devoted to the new available ( proton ) neutron rich nuclei where observables such as the ( proton ) neutron skin radius can be measured .",
    "experiments , like _ e. g. _ p - rex at hall a in jlab , will measure the neutron radius in @xmath16 using parity violating electron scattering  @xcite .",
    "additional phenomenology such as halo nuclei  @xcite has also been observed .",
    "the structure of the manuscript is as follows . in section  [ nuc ]",
    "we present the effective nuclear model used in our simulations . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present the results for the observables obtained from the calculations of the different nuclear isotopic chains considered in this work and finally we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in the present approach we describe matter in nuclear astrophysical scenarios treating nucleons as classical , structureless particles .",
    "the model hamiltonian consists of nucleon kinetic energy , nuclear interaction ( @xmath17 ) , coulomb ( @xmath18 ) and pauli ( @xmath19 ) potentials .",
    "the pauli potential depends not only on relative positions but on momenta of the interacting nucleons .",
    "it simulates nucleon fermionic nature using a gaussian functional form introduced by dorso _",
    "et al . _",

    "we will label this interaction potential as gm model .",
    "let us emphasize that this model has a functional dependence that , although simple , can be used to model extended nuclear systems at high densities ( several times nuclear saturation )  @xcite .",
    "it includes an isospin dependent part to ensure that while pure neutron matter is unbound , symmetric nuclear matter is appropriately bound @xcite . however , in this work we are mainly interested in studying the low density limit of nuclear systems retaining the same functional form in the nn interaction . in this way a consistent check can be performed using the same treatment for nuclear systems in the whole density range where the nucleon picture holds .",
    "it has been shown , for example , that the lack of consistency between results for matter response to a weakly interacting probe , as obtained with fine tuned models for a limited range of systems , can lead to , for example , overpredict neutrino opacities in the astrophysical context  @xcite . for accurate nuclear shell calculations one should relay , however , on more elaborate treatments including the before mentioned richer nn models with additional two and three - body forces as in quantum monte carlo  @xcite or _ ab initio _",

    "the parameter values used in this work are given in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "proton and charge radius can currently be measured with high relative precision using electromagnetic probes by the cross section measurement of elastic scattering of electrons  @xcite or muonic atoms  @xcite . however , for matter and neutron radii the accuracy is not so good due to the fact that there is uncertainty in the nuclear regions probed by the various processes and due to the effective nuclear interactions between nucleons .",
    "antiprotonic atoms  @xcite provide information on neutron distribution in a nucleus .    since protons are electrically charged particles we introduce the coulomb potential , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the proton electric charge .",
    "the antisymmetrization is obtained in an effective way by using a pauli potential under the gaussian form given by , @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the kronecker s delta for the isospin ( spin ) third - component .",
    "it prevents nucleons from occupying the same phase space volume when they have the same quantum numbers",
    ". we will allow a density dependence for this pauli potential in the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 as in  @xcite .",
    "although this effective treatment using a pauli potential is a way of providing antisymmetrization it has some well known shortcomings  @xcite .    in our simulation",

    "in this work we will consider different charge ( matter , neutron , proton ) density operators that will be designated as @xmath48 with @xmath49 and charge @xmath50 with @xmath51 respectively and @xmath52 .",

    "having explicited the different rms radii above we can proceed for neutron rich ( deficient ) clusters and define the difference of rms radii of the neutron and proton distribution @xcite , @xmath60 , as @xmath61 in a similar way we define @xmath62 for the proton rich clusters . there are estimates of this observable in the literature such as in  @xcite where they quote the droplet model based value @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the neutron skin thickness or the shell model potential extimates @xcite .",
    "note that diffuseness of the surface and non - uniformity of densities add corrections to this last expression .",
    "this observable is also closely related  @xcite to the shift in the surface to volume ratio of symmetry energy , @xmath65 as derived in skyrme - hartree - fock models  @xcite and other works  @xcite .    in @xcite a linear fit",
    "is given using a set of experimental data measured in antiprotonic atoms as the isospin asymmetry parameter @xmath66 variates .",
    "they give an expression for the fit of the neutron skin @xmath67 notice however that this is just a fit to medium size nuclei . for smaller",
    "a there are also some calculations such as  @xcite where they consider the light nuclear sector .",
    "additional information using this data can be derived for the symmetry energy  @xcite .",

    "computer simulations are performed by monte carlo techniques where using the metropolis algorithm  @xcite the ground state configuration is searched by thermal relaxation at a fixed temperature @xmath71 mev .",
    "note that the role played by temperature in this semiclassical approach is just that of a parameter to somewhat simulate the effect of zero - point motion in a phenomenological way .",
    "once the thermalized stable clustered configuration is obtained , a nucleus , we statistically sample the system for the averaged magnitudes , namely , binding energies and rms radii .    in fig .",

    "[ fig - n1 ] we show the shift in binding energy per nucleon ( @xmath73 ) from the spin saturated iso - symmetric species ( @xmath74 ) versus nucleon number @xmath9 for carbon ( c ) , oxygen ( o ) , neon ( ne ) and magnesium ( mg ) isotopes as obtained by our simulation .",
    "we can see that for ne and mg the minimum is shifted to the neutron rich side in agreement with experimental binding energy data @xcite .    in fig .",

    "as @xmath9 increases this neutron skin grows since the charge radius remains approximately constant . for the proton rich isotopes a proton skin develops while for nuclei on the neutron rich side a neutron skin forms in agreement with more elaborated relativistic mean field  @xcite or relativistic hartree - bogoliuvov @xcite descriptions including nuclear deformations .",
    "we can see more in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig - n3 ] matter ( boxes ) rms radii for the carbon isotopes along with experimentally deduced values from ref .",
    "data are extracted from hadronic reactions involving break up of nuclei .",
    "for example , in the reaction @xmath77 the width of the momentum distribution , @xmath78 , depends on the mass number of the projectile ( @xmath79 ) and of the fragment ( @xmath80 ) but it is found to be essentially independent of the target mass and beam energy . it can be expressed using the goldhaber model  @xcite as @xmath81 with this prescription and in the approximation where each isotopic component is considered as a fermi gas with fermi momentum @xmath46 , then the nucleon density is @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the reduced width of the momentum distribution and it is associated with the fermi momentum of the nucleons , @xmath84 .",
    "the interaction cross section , @xmath85 , can be experimentally measured with @xmath86 accuracy and functionally can be parameterized as @xmath87 @xmath88 is the interaction radius for the selected projectile on the target nucleus .",

    "[ fig - n4 ] and  [ fig - n5 ] we plot charge and neutron rms radii , respectively , for the carbon isotopes along with experimental data .",
    "we can see that while the neutron rms radius is a rising function of @xmath9 the nuclear charge radius stabilizes from the iso - symmetric isotope ( @xmath90 ) up to values @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the third - component of the isospin .",
    "note that in our analysis we do not consider deformated nuclei since a many - body @xmath93-dependent potential used in nuclear pasta calculations is used .",

    "@xcite and compared to our semiclassical simulation with the gm model .",
    "we can see that the divergence of both models is bigger as the isospin asymmetry grows .",

    "( [ wes ] ) at the highest isospin asymmetry considered in this chain , at a=30 , the discrepancy is about @xmath97 .",

    "neutron excess ( fault ) in the isotope chain results in a developing neutron ( proton ) skin thinner than in the case of carbon and oxygen isotopes .",

    "pasta _ models . in this regime densities in the range of tenths to several times nuclear saturation density are considered .",
    "we obtain some observable properties of finite nuclei regarding charge distribution and different ( matter , neutron , proton , charge ) rms radii for spin saturated nuclei in the mass range with @xmath0 .",
    "we use many - body semiclassical simulations with monte carlo techniques to compare the results provided by such a nuclear interaction , designed to be used in many - body systems to experimental data or more elaborated nuclear models .",
    "we use a hamiltonian model where apart from the kinetic term , the nn interaction consists of a hadronic , coulomb and pauli effective potential terms .",
    "we have shown that for a set of nuclear isotopic chains ( c , o , ne , mg ) experimental binding energies can be well reproduced if a density dependence for the pauli potential is allowed .",
    "we have also analyzed other nuclear structure properties such as matter , neutron and charge radii .",
    "we have found , besides , that our obtained radii agree reasonably well with those deduced from experiment .",
    "as the isospin asymmetry parameter @xmath98 grows , the departure from this trend , as obtained with our simplified model , is larger remaining below @xmath97 however .    for non iso - symmetric clusters we find that a neutron ( proton ) excess results in a neutron ( proton ) skin developing in the exterior shell of the nuclei and computed as the difference of neutron and proton rms radii . for iso - symmetric nuclei in our model",
    "there is a vanishing skin , in accordance with the liquid drop formula .",
    "charge radii are computed in our simulation from point - like particles by folding the proton rms radius with the proton finite size @xmath57 fm .",
    "our computed values agree with measured values within experimental error bars .",
    "charge radii stabilizes as a increases giving the possibility of neutron skin formation on the neutron rich sector .",
    "however , in particular , the neon isotope anomaly  @xcite can not be reproduced within our simplified spherical configuration . for this type of phenomenology nuclear deformations play an important role .",
    "additional enrichment of the model using two and three - body terms could provide better agreement .",
    "using these techniques of semiclassical simulations on effective degrees of freedom allows a consistent procedure to further testing asymmetric systems by studying the formation of clusters in these environments and how their structure affects the opacity of this type of matter .    *",

    "<S> we focus on non iso - symmetric light clusters with nucleon number @xmath0 and use monte carlo many - body techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate isotopic chains for a set of selected nuclei using a model hamiltonian consisting of the usual kinetic term , hadronic nucleon nucleon ( nn ) , coulomb and an effective density dependent pauli potential . it is shown that for neutron rich ( deficient ) clusters neutron ( proton ) skins develop . </S>",
    "<S> different ( matter , neutron , proton , electric charge ) radii are computed for this set of non iso - symmetric nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear binding energies are also analyzed in the isotopic chains . </S>"
