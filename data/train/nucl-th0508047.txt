    "it is well known that the conventional thermal bcs approach produces not very precise results when applied to finite many - particle systems like atomic nuclei , principally due to particle number fluctuations . in order to overcome , at least partially , the shortcomings of the bcs approach a new model , named the modified bcs ( mbcs ) , was suggested and explored in papers @xcite . according to the mbcs calculations a sharp `` superfluid  normal '' phase transition , which is a distinct feature of the conventional thermal bcs theory , appears at much higher temperatures and may be smeared out completely . in this paper",
    "we analyze the performance of the mbcs .",
    "the conventional bcs theory is based on the bogoliubov transformation from particle creation @xmath0 and annihilation @xmath1 operators to quasiparticle operators @xmath2 : @xmath3 where the index @xmath4 corresponds to the level of a mean field with quantum numbers @xmath5 $ ] , projection @xmath6 ( we consider the spherical case ) and energy @xmath7 .",

    "let us consider the simplest case of a constant pairing matrix element @xmath12 .",
    "then the bcs equations have the form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a quasiparticle energy . in these equations",
    "@xmath17 is a pairing gap and @xmath18 is a chemical potential or the energy of a fermi level .",

    "point the behavior of physical observables is smooth ( see fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) ) , the discontinuities at the s - ss point in excitation energy , pairing gap and chemical potential take place . thus , there is no phase transition from the superfluid to normal phase within the mbcs but instead a phase transition of a new type is predicted at finite temperatures .",
    "the absence of the normal phase in all mbcs calculations has motivated us to apply this model to a magic - number system of nucleons in which the existence of this phase at @xmath9 is expected .",
    "the nucleus @xmath53sn has been taken as an example . the mbcs neutron pairing gap ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ f3](a ) ) in this nucleus shows the same behavior as already discussed for @xmath55ni even though a rather complete single particle basis has been employed in @xmath53sn .",

    "[ f3](a ) . to obtain it",
    ", it has been suggested that closed - shell systems should be treated differently from open - shell ones , namely , all summations in the mbcs equations ( [ mbcs2 ] ) should be carried over hole levels only .    in our opinion",
    ", the last recipe contradicts the previous recipe of `` entire spectrum '' in the same publication .",
    "it is also evident that this artificial constraint can not be justified for a heated system .",
    "indeed , both subsystems , the former hole ( fully occupied ) and particle ( empty ) levels , become partially occupied due to the heating and there are no physical reasons to ignore the particle part of a single - particle spectrum . moreover , to keep the number of nucleons @xmath11 constant under the above constraint , forces the mbcs equations to abnormally renormalize the corresponding chemical potential . in the above cs - calculations the @xmath69 quantity runs away from @xmath70  mev to @xmath71  mev ( following the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ f3](b ) ) .",
    "in addition , the capacity of the system is zero in the cs - approximation , i.e. the system is artificially frozen .",
    "the above mbcs results are natural consequences of eqs .",
    "( [ mbcs2 ] ) .",
    "for example , these equations do not have the trivial solution @xmath72 . indeed , from eqs .",
    "( [ uv ] ) it would correspond to +    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      + and contradict the positive definition of @xmath33 .    one may also notice from eqs .",
    "( [ uv ] ) that @xmath73 coefficients become negative for particle levels above a certain temperature , with @xmath31 increasing , since @xmath74 . in which case the mbcs pairing gap @xmath75 receives a positive contribution from hole levels and a negative contribution from particle levels .",
    "thus , the contribution of single - particle and single - hole states to a pairing phenomenon appears to be essentially different .",
    "numeric calculations ( see fig .  [ f1](b ) ) show that two terms in the second expression of eqs .",
    "( [ mbcs2 ] ) compensate each other around the critical temperature of the conventional bcs @xmath76 for particle levels and @xmath77 become negative at higher temperatures .",
    "the gap @xmath78 may vanish at some temperature but only when a negative contribution from particles and positive contribution from holes cancel each other ( notice the difference with the conventional bcs @xmath79 ) .",
    "however if this happens , at higher @xmath52 the balance appears to be broken and @xmath78 becomes finite again .",
    "it also means that @xmath64 has nothing in common with the normal phase and that one can not conclude from the absolute value of the pairing gap how strong the pairing is in the system .",
    "the temperature behavior of the pairing gap depends on a delicate balance between particle- and hole - parts of the single - particle basis used which makes the mbcs predictions very doubtful .",
    "in this section we compare mbcs predictions with exact solutions of the pairing hamiltonian employing the picket fence model ( pfm ) @xcite which is widely used as a test model for the pairing problem ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for numeric calculations",
    "we have selected @xmath80 levels , each of two - fold degenerate ( for spin up and spin down ) , with the energy difference of 1  mev and 10 particles distributed over the levels .",
    "this configuration thus represents 5 levels for holes with energies @xmath81  mev , @xmath82  mev , etc and 5 levels for particles with energies @xmath83  mev , @xmath84  mev , etc .",
    "the mbcs predictions for the pairing gap , excitation energy , and specific heat given by @xmath85 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] by the solid lines . here ,",
    "also shown are the ft - bcs results as dashed lines ( explicit expressions for the quantity @xmath86 in both approaches are given below ) .",
    "both the mbcs and ft - bcs can be compared to the exact solutions of the pairing hamiltonian ( dotted lines ) .",
    "it should be noted that the mbcs - pfm pairing gap behavior is qualitatively very similar to the one in @xmath56ni reported in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) and that the `` superfluid  super - superfluid '' phase transition takes place at @xmath87  mev .",
    "one concludes from fig .",
    "[ f4 ] that the mbcs does not achieve its main goal of improving upon the description of heated nuclei in the conventional ft - bcs .",
    "indeed , except for a narrow region around @xmath88 , the deviation from the exact results is worse in the mbcs case compared to the conventional ft - bcs , which persists even at a very low temperature .",
    "it is also obvious that the `` superfluid  super - superfluid '' phase transition as well as the overall behavior at higher temperatures are artificial effects of the mbcs .",
    "in addition , a more detailed analysis shows that the situation with the mbcs is much worse than the disagreement apparent in fig .",
    "we further present in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] the spectroscopic factors for two particle and two hole levels closest to the fermi surface , within the mbcs ( solid lines ) and ft - bcs ( dashed lines ) for a comparison with the exact results ( dotted lines ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the pairing hamiltonian in the pfm possesses particle - hole symmetry .",
    "for this reason , dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] for hole @xmath89 and particle @xmath90 levels are ideally symmetric about the @xmath91 line .",
    "the same is true for the ft - bcs results .",
    "nothing of this symmetry remains after the secondary bogoliubov transformation of eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) is applied in the mbcs ( see solid lines in the same figure ) .",
    "in addition , the description of this physical observable in the mbcs is very poor compared to the ft - bcs results .",
    "breaking of the particle - hole symmetry in the mbcs calculations is even more clearly seen from an analysis of the mbcs quasiparticle spectrum presented in fig .",
    "[ f6](b ) . in the pfm",
    "it should be two - fold degenerate ( i.e. @xmath92 ) as , e.g. , in the ft - bcs calculation in fig .",
    "[ f6](a ) because of this symmetry .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath69 in the mbcs calculations does not stay at zero energy ( as it should be ) but runs away to positive values as temperature increases .",
    "this explains why the level @xmath93 appears at a lower energy than the @xmath94 level above @xmath95  mev .",
    "it is also the origin of the @xmath96 splitting in these calculations .",
    "we have repeated the mbcs - pfm calculations with different values of the pairing strength @xmath97 . as @xmath24 increases",
    ", the mbcs `` superfluid  super - superfluid '' phase transition takes place at a lower temperature and the splitting of @xmath90 and @xmath89 levels becomes stronger .",
    "another consequence of the particle - hole symmetry is that under any conditions it should be true that @xmath98 and @xmath99 or alternatively @xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we demonstrate what happens to this analytical identity in the mbcs .",
    "the calculations have been performed for a different number of levels @xmath11 of the pfm and the strength parameter g has been adjusted to keep @xmath101  mev in each calculation .",
    "the convergence of the results in this @xmath52-range ( also for @xmath75 , @xmath69 , and @xmath102 ) is reached at @xmath103 .",
    "the conclusion from fig .",
    "[ f7 ] is that the analytical identity of eq .",
    "( [ exa ] ) is completely broken in mbcs calculations even from very low temperatures .",
    "thus , one can see that the mbcs severely violates the symmetry between particles and holes which is an essential feature of the pairing problem solved for the pfm .",
    "accordingly , the mbcs can be applied to this problem only at temperatures much lower than @xmath88 .",
    "in this section the evaluation of the mbcs equations is analyzed to verify consistency . to start with we agree that the pairing hamiltonian @xmath104 expressed via the mbcs variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 has the same form as the bcs hamiltonian @xmath105 of eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) at @xmath106 .",
    "it is also true that the expectation value of the pairing hamiltonian @xmath107 at @xmath46 looks similar to @xmath108 in the case of the bcs at @xmath106 .",
    "but then the formal similarity is broken and the corresponding energies @xmath109 are attributed to the conventional bogoliubov quasiparticles and not to the `` bar''-quasiparticles . these energies @xmath110 enter through new thermal occupation numbers @xmath31 and new @xmath111-coefficients @xmath112 ( see remarks on page 8 in ref .",
    "@xcite just after eq .",
    "( 86 ) ) .    in another words ,",
    "the mbcs procedure yields new eigen energies of bogoliubov quasiparticles while new eigen states are now modified quasiparticles .",
    "the point here is that if one would take the mean of the modified quasiparticle energies under @xmath109 , they should coincide with the bcs @xmath35 at @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , the secondary bogoliubov transformation of eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) is a unitary one and as such , can not change the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian .",
    "there are several possibilities to derive analytically the bcs equations from the expectation value @xmath108 at @xmath106 .",
