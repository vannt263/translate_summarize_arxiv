    "<S> while ion heating by elastic electron - ion collisions may be neglected for a description of the evolution of freely expanding ultracold neutral plasmas , the situation is different in scenarios where the ions are laser - cooled during the system evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we show that electron - ion collisions in laser - cooled plasmas influence the ionic temperature , decreasing the degree of correlation obtainable in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , taking into account the collisions increases the ion temperature much less than what would be estimated based on static plasma clouds neglecting the plasma expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the latter leads to both adiabatic cooling of the ions as well as , more importantly , a rapid decrease of the collisional heating rate .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the field of ultracold ( @xmath0k ) neutral plasmas and rydberg gases has attracted attention both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the motivations of the experiments @xcite is the creation of a so - called strongly coupled plasma , where the _ coulomb coupling parameter _ @xmath1 is much larger than unity ( where @xmath2 is the wigner - seitz radius and @xmath3 is the temperature of the ions ) . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , interesting ordering effects such as coulomb crystallization into cubic or shell - structure lattices can be observed . in the experiments @xcite strongly coupled ions </S>",
    "<S> can not be observed since the temperature of the initially cold ions rises quickly on the timescale of the inverse ionic plasma frequency @xmath4 due to disorder - induced heating @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different ways to overcome this heating effect have been proposed @xcite . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , it has been suggested that continuous laser cooling during the plasma expansion may considerably increase the achievable coulomb coupling parameter of the ions .    using a hybrid molecular dynamics approach @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we have predicted that coulomb crystallization in an unconfined ultracold neutral plasma can indeed be obtained if the plasma ions are laser - cooled during the evolution of the system @xcite . in this theoretical approach , </S>",
    "<S> the electronic component of the plasma is treated as a fluid while ions and recombined atoms are described on a full molecular dynamics level . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , an adiabatic approximation is made for the electrons , which are assumed to be distributed according to the mean - field potential generated by ions and electrons , calculated in a self - consistent way . </S>",
    "<S> their velocity distribution is assumed to be of michie - king - type @xcite which takes into account deviations of the quasi - equilibrium state from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution due to the finite depth of the potential well generated by the ions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter leads to an evaporation of a fraction of the electrons in the initial stage immediately after the plasma formation , which is taken into account using the results of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ions , on the other hand , are propagated under the influence of all other ions and the electronic mean - field . </S>",
    "<S> finally , inelastic collisions , i.e.three-body recombination , electron - impact ionization and electron - impact ( de)excitation , are included on the basis of a monte carlo treatment . </S>",
    "<S> _ elastic _ electron - ion collisions , however , are neglected in this approach , as in other approaches for the description of ultracold plasmas @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this neglect of elastic electron - ion collisions in the dynamics is well justified for the description of freely expanding ultracold plasmas as created in @xcite because of a clear separation of timescales . due to the large mass ratio between ions and electrons , </S>",
    "<S> the time necessary for equilibration of the electron and ion temperature is typically of the order of a few milliseconds , while the plasma expansion takes place on a microsecond timescale . </S>",
    "<S> hence , elastic electron - ion collisions only increase the ion temperature by some milli - kelvin during the experimental observation time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this amount of heating is negligible compared to the initial temperature increase due to disorder - induced heating , which rises the ion temperature to about one kelvin . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the time evolution of the ion temperature which enters @xmath5 and determines the degree of coupling of the ions is mainly determined by this disorder - induced heating .    </S>",
    "<S> however , this situation changes in the scenario of @xcite , where additional laser cooling of the ions compensates the disorder - induced heating and keeps the ionic temperature on a milli - kelvin level . in this case , the ion temperature is not only increased by electron - ion collisions , but is also driven to the doppler temperature , i.e.  the limiting temperature @xmath6 for laser cooling , due to the coupling to the radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> the final ion temperature is now determined by the balance between the collisional heating rate and the laser - cooling rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath6 is typically of the order of one milli - kelvin , i.e.  of the same order of magnitude as the amount of collisional heating , the ion temperature may considerably increase through electron - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , electron - ion collisions could significantly decrease the coulomb coupling parameter achievable by laser - cooling of expanding ultracold neutral plasmas . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , the influence of such collisions on the onset of coulomb crystallization during the plasma expansion is critically reassessed .    </S>",
    "<S> the system under study is the same as that of @xcite , namely an unconfined , ultracold neutral plasma under the additional influence of a cooling laser . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma is treated on the basis of the hybrid - md method outlined above and described in detail in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> laser cooling is modelled by adding a langevin force , @xmath7 , to the ion equation of motion , where @xmath8 is the ion velocity , @xmath9 is a stochastic variable with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the cooling rate @xmath12 and the corresponding doppler temperature @xmath13 are determined by the properties of the cooling laser @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the weak electron coupling , which justifies our hybrid treatment of the plasma dynamics , also allows us to describe electron - ion collisions with a boltzmann - type collision operator , as we shall discuss below . </S>",
    "<S> the implementation of electron - ion collisions is very similiar to the treatment of electron - electron collisions used in @xcite and has been introduced before in @xcite . for an ion at position @xmath14 with velocity @xmath15 , </S>",
    "<S> the rate of electron - ion collisions is @xmath16 hence , @xmath17 is the probability that a collision will occur during a timestep @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , the integration over the electronic velocity distribution in equation ( [ rate ] ) is done via a monte carlo procedure . at each timestep , </S>",
    "<S> an electronic velocity @xmath19 is chosen randomly according to a maxwell - boltzmann distribution with temperature @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability for an electron - ion collision is then given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 the so - called coulomb logarithm and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rutherford cross section for coulomb scattering @xcite and @xmath25 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the derivation of equation ( [ coprob ] ) , the approximation @xmath26 has been made ( see below ) .    in the monte carlo treatment outlined above </S>",
    "<S> , an electron - ion collision takes place with a probability @xmath27 . in this case , a scattering angle @xmath28 is determined according to the probability measure @xmath29 , leading to the prescription @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a random number distributed uniformly in @xmath32 $ ] . with this , </S>",
    "<S> the change of ionic momentum is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a vector denoting the random direction of the momentum transfer chosen uniformly on the unit sphere . </S>",
    "<S> finally , energy conservation is restored by adjusting the electronic temperature @xmath20 .    as mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , the derivation of equation ( [ coprob ] ) implies the limit @xmath35 . in this case , individual collision events satisfy momentum conservation , but energy conservation is violated and has to be corrected manually by adjusting the electron temperature . the error introduced by this approximation </S>",
    "<S> can be shown to be of the order of the temperature ratio @xmath36 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , as long as the ionic temperature is small compared to the electronic temperature , which is the case over the whole time of the experiments under consideration , the corresponding corrections can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the method described above thus allows for an efficient simulation of electron - ion collisions without the need for time - consuming transformations between laboratory and center - of - mass coordinate systems .    in order to check the influence of elastic electron - ion collisions on the plasma dynamics , we have simulated the expansion of a plasma with an initial electronic coulomb coupling parameter of @xmath37 , consisting of @xmath38 be ions at a density of @xmath39 @xmath40 , cooled with a damping rate of @xmath41 and a doppler temperature of @xmath42mk . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen in figure [ fig1 ] ,    the inclusion of elastic electron - ion collisions significantly reduces the ionic coupling parameter which can be achieved in this case . </S>",
    "<S> however , the value @xmath43 obtained after several @xmath44s is still considerably larger than the critical value @xmath45 @xcite for crystallization . the good agreement found between the distribution of interionic distances , calculated as described in @xcite , and the pair - correlation function of a one - component plasma at @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also confirms that the system evolves well into the strongly coupled regime ( figure [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that debye shielding of the ion - ion interaction , which is not included in the present considerations , tends to increase the crystallization limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown in @xcite , even for a comparably large electron coupling of @xmath47 the crystallization limit is increased to @xmath48 only , hence the inclusion of debye screening does not significantly alter the results obtained with the present model .    in fact </S>",
    "<S> , the simulation results show that the final @xmath43 is much larger than what one would expect from a static estimate by equating the heating @xmath49 resulting from electron - ion collisions to the cooling @xmath50 of the laser cooling as done in @xcite . from the procedure described above , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 is obtained as which is well fulfilled over the whole timescale of the experiments as described above . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 leading to the landau - spitzer expression for the average heating rate @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the electronic plasma frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the validity and extensions of the landau - spitzer formula , which was originally derived for weakly coupled plasmas , have been discussed in several publications @xcite . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> ion heating by binary collisions has been studied without employing the cutoff - procedure equation ( [ cs ] ) . for @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> their numerical results are reproduced by equation ( [ geic ] ) to within @xmath56 . moreover , collective effects , which largely decrease the relaxation rate at strong coupling @xcite , were found to be negligible even for arbitrarily strong ion - ion coupling , as long as the electron - ion coupling is weak and the resonance of the ion excitation spectrum lies far below that of the electrons @xcite . therefore , under the present conditions , which correspond to the parameter regime studied in @xcite , the monte carlo treatment described above yields an adequate description of the electron - ion temperature relaxation process .    </S>",
    "<S> balancing collisional heating with the laser cooling one might expect a quasi - equilibrium state with a final ion temperature of @xmath57 leading to a coulomb coupling parameter @xmath58 in the optimal limit that @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> for the parameters used in figure [ fig1 ] , equation ( [ static ] ) predicts a final @xmath60 , which is much smaller than what is observed in the simulation .    in order to trace the origin of this discrepancy </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed a second set of simulations .    in one simulation </S>",
    "<S> , we have set the doppler temperature @xmath6 equal to zero and have turned off the initial correlation - induced heating of the ions by propagating them in the framework of a particle - in - cell method @xcite , i.e.  on a mean - field level , rather than by a full md simulation . by doing this , only the competition between the laser cooling , the heating by electron - ion collisions , and the adiabatic expansion determines the evolution of the ion temperature . in the second type of simulation , @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> is also set to zero and all particle interactions except the binary electron - ion collisions causing the ion heating are neglected , which results in a basically static ionic density .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting time evolution of the ionic temperature for a plasma of @xmath61 ions with @xmath62@xmath40 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 is shown in figure [ fig3 ] . in the static case ( dashed line in figure [ fig3 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the temperature shows an initial linear rise with a slope corresponding to the collisional heating rate @xmath65 and then quickly saturates to a value which is well described by equation ( [ statictemp ] ) ( marked by the arrow in the figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of an expanding plasma ( solid line in figure [ fig3 ] ) the temperature is drastically reduced . </S>",
    "<S> while the initial rise of the ion temperature stays the same , the temperature starts to drop down already at a relatively early time , which at this stage is mainly caused by adiabatic cooling of the ions due to the plasma expansion . at later times </S>",
    "<S> , the ion temperature is driven to its steady - state value given by the balance between the collisional heating and the laser cooling ( equation ( [ statictemp ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the long - time behaviour of the ionic temperature can be estimated from the plasma dynamics discussed in @xcite , where it was found that laser cooling strongly alters the expansion behaviour , leading to an increase of the plasma width @xmath66 according to @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> it was also shown there that the adiabatic law for the selfsimilar plasma expansion , @xmath68 , still holds , which gives together with equation ( [ statictemp ] ) for @xmath69 @xmath70 while the ionic coulomb coupling parameter increases according to @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen in the inset of figure [ fig3 ] , equation ( [ selfs ] ) is well reproduced by the numerical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is indeed this adiabatic cooling of the expanding plasma together with a decreasing collisional heating rate @xmath72 which leads to much lower temperatures and consequently to much larger coulomb coupling parameters than those predicted by a static estimate .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulations described above demonstrate that electron - ion collisions do not prohibit achieving ionic coulomb coupling parameters above the crystallization limit . however , for a given set of initial - state parameters , @xmath43 can be significantly reduced by collisional heating during the plasma evolution , leading to an additional restriction of the initial - state parameters for which strongly coupled states can be achieved . since it was found that the degree of spatial order in the system sensitively depends on initial conditions such as number of ions , electron temperature etc . </S>",
    "<S> , one may wonder whether the long - range ordering into shell structures described in @xcite is still observable in simulations taking into account the electron - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in figure [ fig4 ] for a plasma of @xmath73 ions with a density of @xmath74@xmath40 and @xmath63 , cooled with a damping rate of @xmath75 and a limiting temperature of @xmath76mk . </S>",
    "<S> the ordering into concentric shells is clearly visible in the radial density after a time of @xmath77s .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented simulations for laser - cooled ultracold neutral plasmas including elastic electron - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that these collisions can have a significant influence on the final ionic temperature , and hence the degree of correlation , achievable under given experimental conditions . yet , with a proper choice of initial conditions rather large coulomb coupling parameters can still be achieved . as we have shown , this is due to the fact that the expansion of the plasma drastically reduces the ion temperature , due to adiabatic cooling of the ions as well as a decreasing heating rate during the course of the plasma evolution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the resulting coulomb coupling parameters are much larger than one would expect from static estimates as in @xcite . we thus conclude that our predictions made in @xcite about the possibility to observe coulomb crystallization in such a system remain valid . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have shown here that the electron - ion collisions do not preclude the build - up of long - range order and the formation of the shell structures predicted in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental realizability of the discussed scheme has been demonstrated recently in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there , the ion temperature of an ultracold strontium plasma has been measured by driving the core transition of the plasma ions during the gas expansion . </S>",
    "<S> since the same transition which allowed for doppler imaging can be used to cool the ions , these experiments provide the first step towards a realization of strongly coupled ultracold plasmas in the laboratory .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to thank t.c .  </S>",
