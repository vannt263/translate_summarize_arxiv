    "the detection of cosmic radiation from space in the early 20th century was the first step of the today established idea that particles can be accelerated to ultra - high energies by cosmic accelerators  @xcite .",
    "today , the cosmic ray energy spectrum ranges from below @xmath0  ev up to energies larger than a joule , @xmath1  ev , see fig .",
    "[ crs_and_nus : fig ] ( left ) .",
    "still , the origin of those cosmic rays could not be identified unambiguously yet due to the scrambling of their original directions by galactic magnetic fields .",
    "high - energy neutrinos play an important role in identifying cosmic ray accelerators .",
    "undeflected and unabsorbed , they traverse the universe and are therefore perfect messengers from the acceleration region of baryonic particles .",
    "this advantage poses a disadvantage for the detection of neutrinos , which is one of the reasons why only two neutrino source predictions could be confirmed until today : solar neutrinos and the supernova 1987a .",
    "figure  [ crs_and_nus : fig ] shows the expected astrophysical neutrino spectrum , ranging from @xmath2  ev energies ( cosmic background neutrinos , decoupled after @xmath3  s after the big bang ) , up to @xmath4  ev - those high - energy neutrinos connected to the highest energy cosmic rays . in this contribution",
    ", the possible production sites in astrophysical source classes are the topic of this paper .",
    "section  [ nu_emitters : sec ] discusses candidate sources for high - energy production . in section  [",
    "nu_models : sec ] , neutrino flux models are presented in the context of current experimental limits .",
    "section  [ outlook : sec ] gives an outlook on future neutrino astronomy .",
    "neutrinos are dominantly produced in interactions of protons with ambient photon or proton fields : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the charged pions subsequently decay to produce neutrinos , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the neutrino flavors are produced at the source in ratios @xmath9 .",
    "due to neutrino oscillations , the ratio at earth becomes @xmath10 . in order to produce a significant neutrino flux ,",
    "two criteria need to be fulfilled :    1 .",
    "the kinematics must allow for the production of the delta - resonance in the case of @xmath11 interactions , and for the production of the three pions in case of proton - proton interactions .",
    "the environment of the source needs to provide sufficient photon or proton targets , i.e.  the optical depth for proton - proton or proton - photon interactions , @xmath12 or @xmath13 , needs to be close to or above unity , @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the mean free path is given as @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the extension of the source .    in any case",
    ", the sources need to contain high - energy protons in order to have the above collisions .",
    "this means the proposed sources for cosmic ray acceleration corresponds to the predicted sources of neutrino emission . here",
    ", two criteria have to be met to have a source class responsible for a particle flux as high as observed in the cosmic ray spectrum :    1 .   the maximum energy of",
    "the particle must be high enough .",
    "a single particle s energy is mainly determined by the product of the extension of the source , @xmath17 , and the source s magnetic field , @xmath18 , see  @xcite : @xmath19 . here , @xmath20 is the charge of the particle in units of the electron s charge .",
    "further , @xmath21 is the velocity of the shock region , in which the particle is accelerated , in units of the speed of light .",
    "the non - thermal , electromagnetic luminosity of the sources is directly connected to the acceleration : it is mainly produced by accelerated electrons , emitting synchrotron radiation .",
    "if protons are present in the source , they are accelerated in the same way .",
    "thus , the electromagnetic energy , @xmath22 , must correspond to or exceed the total energy observed in cosmic rays , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . here , the total electromagnetic energy release of a source class can be determined by multiplying the characteristic luminosity with the life time of the sources . to determine the total energy in cosmic rays , the total energy density measured at earth needs to be multiplied with the expected volume of the sources producing the cosmic rays . for a detailed discussion , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a list of proposed sources of cosmic rays contributing at different energies in the spectrum is given in table  [ sources_cr_spect : tab ] .",
    "lllll source class & @xmath25 [ erg / s]&life time [ yr]&energy range&ref + snr & @xmath26&1000&@xmath27  ev@xmath28  ev&@xcite + snr - wind&@xmath29&1000&@xmath27  ev@xmath30  ev&@xcite + x - ray binaries&@xmath31&@xmath32&@xmath33  ev@xmath30  ev&@xcite + pulsars&@xmath34&@xmath35&@xmath33  ev@xmath30  ev&@xcite + galaxy clusters&@xmath36&@xmath37&@xmath38  ev@xmath39  ev&@xcite + agn&@xmath40&@xmath37&@xmath38  ev@xmath39  ev&@xcite + grbs&@xmath41&@xmath42&@xmath38  ev@xmath39  ev&@xcite +    supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the galaxy are the best candidates for cosmic ray production below the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum , i.e.  @xmath43  ev . if a supernova does not explode into the interstellar medium , but into a dense environment ( snr - wind ) , energies up to @xmath44  ev can be achieved .",
    "x - ray binaries and pulsars in the galaxy to not provide enough total energy of the cosmic ray flux below the knee .",
    "however , their maximum energy and their energy output is enough to contribute in the energy range between knee and ankle , i.e.  @xmath45  ev  @xmath46  ev . above the ankle ,",
    "the sources can not be of galactic origin  ev , the energy of the emitted charged particles is high enough to let the particles travel on straight lines despite galactic magnetic field deflections . since no such anisotropy was observed for cosmic rays above the ankle , they have to come from larger distances , i.e.  they must be extragalactic . ] .",
    "extragalactic candidates providing sufficient maximum energies and total energy release are galaxy clusters , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "alternative neutrino production scenarios are usually connected with _ hidden _ cosmic ray sources .",
    "if an accelerator of cosmic rays lies behind dense molecular clouds , the high - energy protons interact with the hydrogen atoms in the clouds .",
    "while the protons are absorbed this way , neutrinos are produced in high numbers as described above .",
    "this process can happen on galactic scales , when a supernova remnant or a pulsar sits behind molecular clouds , or on extragalactic scales , when an agn jet is absorbed by dense matter .",
    "the neutrino flux of a single emitting source follows the protons in their spectral behavior .",
    "the energy spectrum , @xmath47 , is thus represented by a power law with a spectral index around @xmath48 and a cutoff depending on the maximum proton energy , @xmath49 : @xmath50 the signal strength , @xmath51 , can be determined by assuming the production of neutrinos in correlation with either high - energy cosmic rays or photon emission .",
    "depending on the model , neutrinos can for instance be connected to radio emission , because it reflects the acceleration of electrons , which in turn mirrors the protons acceleration .",
    "alternatively , high - energy photon emission can be accompanied by a neutrino signal : neutral pions , originating from the same process as charged pions as described above , decay into photons at mev - tev energies .    the neutrino flux from a class of objects , @xmath52 , can then be determined by folding the single source flux with the source distribution function , @xmath53 , giving the number of sources per luminosity @xmath17 and per comoving volume @xmath54 : @xmath55 the factor @xmath56 takes into account the decrease of the flux with the luminosity distance @xmath57 . here",
    ", the status of neutrino flux modeling in the context of observational astronomy is reviewed .",
    "the modeling of neutrino fluxes constantly improved throughout the years , using new pieces of information provided by cosmic ray experiments , kev - tev photon astronomy and in particular from large volume neutrino detectors which have improved limits by several orders of magnitude over the years . despite the lack of detected sources so far , those strict experimental limits start to exclude certain classes of sources , leaving other source classes in favor of producing high - energy neutrinos .",
    "one of the most important examples is that the correlation between x - rays and neutrinos from agn can be excluded : the possible contribution of x - ray emitting agn to the neutrino background was calculated by different authors  @xcite .",
    "each of the predictions exceeds current neutrino flux limits by at least one order of magnitude , see  @xcite .",
    "the progress of neutrino astronomy within the past 10 years is shown in fig .",
    "[ mpr_wb_procs : fig ] .",
    "experimental limits were at a level @xmath58 in the late 1990s and have improved by more than 2 orders of magnitude in the past 10 years .",
    "this is an important step , given the theoretical upper bounds derived in the late 1990s as well , see  @xcite , implying that sources optically thin for neutron - photon interactions can not provide more than @xmath59 and optically thick sources are restricted to @xmath60 , depending on the energy . today",
    ", neutrino flux models below those two bounds can easily be explored by experiments like amanda , anita , auger and many more .",
    "next generation neutrino telescopes like icecube and km3net will improve the sensitivities by a further factor @xmath61 within the first year of operation .",
    "many of the source classes are still unexplored due to limited experimental sensitivities .",
    "the two most interesting classes of extragalactic objects , grbs and agn , providing intensities in excess of icecube s sensitivity within the first years of operation , are presented here .    *",
    "_ gamma ray bursts _",
    "+ grbs were proposed as the sources of cosmic rays above the ankle  @xcite . due to the high synchrotron field in those sources",
    ", they are good neutrino candidates as well  @xcite .",
    "the stacking of identified grbs for neutrino data provides the best limit so far , see  @xcite , reaching within a factor of a few above the classical grb neutrino flux prediction given in @xcite .",
    "a single , bright grb can be identified with a fully operational @xmath3  km@xmath62-detector like icecube .",
    "the bright burst grb080319b was observed by icecube while under construction , with @xmath63  km@xmath62 operational volume , and @xmath64 expected events at a much lower background level  @xcite . with a full icecube detector , between @xmath65 events",
    "are expected . * _ active galactic nuclei _ + a variety of agn sub - classes are proposed as potential neutrino emitters . among the most prominent ones",
    "are tev photon emitters , under the assumption that the tev emission originates from @xmath66decays rather than from inverse compton scattering , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "another option is that those agn responsible for the cosmic ray flux above the ankle also produce neutrinos .",
    "this implies that the cosmic ray emitters need to provide a target that absorbs part of the cosmic rays before they can escape the source , i.e.  either sufficiently high photon or proton fields .",
    "possible targets are the accretion disk s radiation field , the synchrotron field in the jet , or the torus as a baryonic target",
    ". a first hint of a correlation between the highest energy cosmic rays and a catalog of close agn was announced by auger  @xcite .",
    "this correlation can be used to estimate the neutrino flux from the same sources .",
    "different predictions , many of them based on the assumption that the close agn centaurus a is one of the dominant sources , are presented in fig .",
    "[ auger_neutrinos : fig ] .",
    "previous high - energy neutrino detectors turned helped excluding different scenarios of neutrino production so far .",
    "future detectors like icecube and km3net will provide large enough effective volumes to explore further orders of magnitude in the neutrino energy density of different single sources or source classes .    in order to identify the sources of cosmic rays and the mechanisms producing them ,",
    "multiwavelength astronomy is crucial .",
    "each of the messengers , i.e.  charged cosmic rays , radio to tev photons , neutrinos and also gravitational waves , provide us with pieces of information . we need to have all those pieces in order to see the whole picture .",
    "the role of neutrino astronomy in this puzzle is to identify the birth place of cosmic rays .",
