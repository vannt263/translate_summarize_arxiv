    "it is commonly believed that the early universe has experienced a stage of accelerated expansion which is known as inflation @xcite . during inflation one of the tiny patches of the very early universe",
    "was superluminally stretched to become our observable universe today .",
    "the theory of inflation can naturally explain why the universe is flat , homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "inflation is driven by the potential energy of a scalar field called inflaton and its quantum fluctuations turn out to be the primordial density fluctuations which seed the observed large - scale structures ( lss ) and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "inflation typically ends with a period of reheating when the inflaton starts rapid oscillations and it decays into standard particles .",
    "then the universe starts the standard hot big bang evolution .    over the past decade",
    ", the theory of inflation has successfully passed several nontrivial tests .",
    "in particular , the first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap ) @xcite has detected a large - angle anti - correlation in the temperature - polarization cross - power spectrum , which is the signature of adiabatic superhorizon fluctuations at the time of decoupling @xcite .",
    "the recently released three year wmap ( wmap3 ) @xcite has marked another milestone on the precision cosmology of cmb radiation .",
    "the simplest six - parameter power - law @xmath4cdm cosmology , namely with matter density @xmath5 , baryon density @xmath15 , hubble constant @xmath7 , optical depth @xmath8 , the spectral index and amplitude of the scalar perturbation spectrum , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , turn out to be in good agreement with wmap3 together with the small - scale cmb observations such as boomerang @xcite , the arcminute cosmology bolometer array receiver ( acbar @xcite ) , the cosmic background imager ( cbi @xcite ) and the very small array(vsa @xcite ) , lss as measured by two degree field ( 2df ) @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and with the type ia supernova ( snia ) as measured by the riess `` gold '' sample @xcite and the first year supernova legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite .",
    "this agreement between the above `` canonical '' cosmological model and observations can be used to test a number of possible new physics , such as the equation of state of dark energy , neutrino masses , cosmic cpt violation , etc .",
    "although the temperature - temperature correlation power ( tt ) of wmap3 is now cosmic - variance limited up to @xmath16 and the third peak is now detected , the features discovered by the first year wmap @xcite are still present : the low tt quadrupole and localized oscillating features on tt for @xmath17 @xcite . although the signatures of glitches on the first peak discovered by the first year wmap have now become weaker , they do exceed the limit of cosmic variance @xcite .",
    "in fact , even before the release of the first year wmap ref .",
    "@xcite claimed oscillating primordial spectrum could lead to oscillations around the first peak of cmb tt power .",
    "these data have hence revealed many interesting detailed features which can not be explained in the simplest version of the inflation model , and we are making much effort to construct a realistic particle physics model of inflation .    as for the shape of the primordial power spectrum , it is also noteworthy that a significant deviation has been observed by wmap3 from the simplest harrison - zeldovich - peebles scale - invariant spectrum ( @xmath11 and no tensor contributions ) , and that this feature is more eminent with the combination of all the currently available cmb , lss and snia ( dubbed the case of `` all '' in @xcite ) . on the other hand , a nontrivial negative running of the scalar spectral index @xmath18 ,",
    "whose existence was studied even before wmap epoch @xcite(for relevant study see also @xcite ) , was favored by the first - year wmap papers @xcite . but its preference was somehow diminished as corrections to the likelihood functions were made @xcite .",
    "dramatically , the new wmap3 data prefers again a negative running in the `` all '' combination @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , a nonvanishing running of @xmath18 would not only constrain inflationary cosmology significantly @xcite , but also affect the cosmological constraint on the neutrino mass @xcite .    in the present paper , using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method , we aim to probe the scale dependence of the primordial spectrum in the light of wmap3 alone and that in combination with the other cosmological observations from galaxy clustering and snia .",
    "we pay particular attention to the combination with the lyman @xmath0 ( ly@xmath0 ) forest .",
    "we will show that , different from the first - year wmap ( wmap1 ) , wmap3 s preference on the running of the scalar spectral index on the large scales is now fairly independent of the low cmb multipoles @xmath1 .",
    "we also find that a combination of wmap3 with the galaxy power spectrum from sdss prefers a negative running with more than 2@xmath2 , regardless of the presence of low @xmath1 cmb ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we focus on the power law @xmath4cdm cosmology with only six parameters , we find that when one drops the low @xmath1 cmb contributions wmap3 would be consistent with the harrison - zeldovich - peebles scale - invariant spectrum at @xmath12 . assuming a simple power - law primordial spectral index or a constant running , in cases one drops the low @xmath1 contributions ( @xmath3 ) wmap3 is consistent with the other observations better , such as the value of @xmath13 . on the other hand , using a spectral shape with a minimal extension of the running spectral index model , we find luqas@xmath14 croft ly@xmath0 @xcite and sdss ly@xmath0 @xcite exhibit somewhat different preference on the spectral shape , although it is difficult to draw any definite conclusion because the result depends on how we model the spectral shape .",

    "iii we analyze the effects of low cmb multipoles on the determination of cosmological parameters using wmap3 @xcite , snia @xcite , 2df @xcite and sloan digital sky survey 3-d power spectrum ( sdss p(k ) ) @xcite , luqas+croft sample of lyman @xmath0 @xcite and sdss lyman @xmath0 sample @xcite by global fittings using the mcmc technique . in section iv scale dependence of fluctuations is analyzed with priors on the hubble parameter , @xmath19 , and the cosmic age .",

    "regarding the first - year wmap data the e mode polarization not being directly measured , there have been simultaneously low tt multipoles and high te multipoles @xcite . to be conservative ref .",
    "@xcite used only tt data to probe the possible new physics during inflation and ref .",
    "@xcite showed that if assuming without significant contaminations , in the general framework the observed te amplitude on the largest scales would be in very large discrepancy with the observed tt for the concordance @xmath4cdm model .",
    "moreover bridle et al .",
    "@xcite found that the claimed preference of a negative @xmath18 was merely due to the lowest wmap1 multipoles . in order to probe the sensitivity of the running to the lower multipoles we analyze the running properties using the cmb data with and without the contributions of lower multipoles which suffer from large cosmic variance @xcite .    for wmap3 the large scale cmb data",
    "not only include the temperature power spectrum tt , but also the measurements of the polarization spectrum ee , bb and the temperature polarization spectrum te .",
    "given the distinctive feature of low @xmath1 cmb @xcite , for wmap3 the pixel - based method has been applied to @xmath42 for @xmath43 and to polarization for @xmath3 in refs .",
    "these large - scale components suffer from larger cosmic variance , possibly uncleaned foreground contaminations and their statistical nature is somewhat different from gaussian .",
    "for these reasons we have tentatively prepared two different data - sets of wmap3 , one being the `` normal '' one with the full range tt , te and other polarization data , the other being the truncated one where all of the components with @xmath44 have been dropped .",
    "we analyze these two data - sets separately in various models and compare with each other . also for a clear comparison and for the fact that wmap1 should exhibit similar properties on low @xmath1 to wmap3",
    ", we also truncate the tt and te likelihood of wmap1 at @xmath45 .",
    "thus for the truncated data - set essentially for both wmap1 and wmap3 we will use only the tt and te cmb spectra on the truncated smaller scales .",
    "the truncated data - set , although with less amount of information , may be more conservative but more robust compared with the normal one .",
    "while the simplest single field inflation generically predicts nearly scale - invariant primordial spectrum on the cmb relevant large scales , the inflaton would run faster in its later epoch and for the scales probed by wmap@xmath14 ly@xmath0 , an appreciable deviation from scale invariance is possibly present even in the framework of simple single - field inflation models . on the other hand , even for the simplest inflaton potentials known for a long time , the resulting primordial spectrum can be certainly more complicated than usually expected @xcite .    motivated by these we mainly focus on our fittings to the power law @xmath4cdm ( plcdm ) model with a constant primordial spectral index @xmath9 and running spectral index @xmath4cdm ( rlcdm ) model with a constant running @xmath0 . in order to see",
    "if models with more drastic scale - dependence are observationally more plausible , we also consider a running spectral index @xmath4cdm model with a step - like @xmath9 divided at @xmath46 mpc@xmath26 ( srlcdm ) as an example . in this model , we assume there is a constant primordial spectral index @xmath47 with no running for @xmath48 mpc@xmath26 . while the amplitudes of @xmath9 and @xmath47 are not continuous , we naturally assure the continuity of the primordial scalar spectrum @xmath49 at 0.1 mpc@xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 , being defined as the amplitude of density fluctuations at 8 @xmath50mpc , can not be determined by wmap3 alone , which can probe the the shape of the primordial spectrum only up to @xmath51 mpc@xmath26 @xcite , without extrapolating the information of the primordial spectrum to much smaller scales , except for an exotic case that the hubble constant is anomalously small , which is certainly impossible at the first glance in the concordance cosmology . on the other hand if we assume no prior on the shape of the primordial spectrum and reconstruct the shape of the primordial spectrum in a model independent way like cosmic inversion @xcite , even the extremely exotic values of @xmath29 still remain possible , at least in cases we use only the cmb tt observations . in the present work",
    "we do not pursue the shape of the primordial spectrum in a model independent way and will study the cosmological implications on the shape of the primordial spectrum and the amplitude of @xmath13 with the forementioned method .",
    "it is believed that the secondary effects on cmb like the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effects and cmb lensing effects are typically very small and their effects are comparable with each other .",
    "one would take the risk of getting biased if considering only one of them @xcite . neglecting",
    "both of them is a plausible way in the determination of the cosmological parameters for the interest of the current paper @xcite .",
    "hence in the present study we have neglected both of the secondary effects .",
    "for each regular calculation of mcmc , we run 6 independent chains comprising of 150,000 - 300,000 chain elements and spend thousands of cpu hours to calculate on a supercomputer .",
    "the average acceptance rate is about 40% . to get the converged results ,",
    "we test the convergence of the chains by gelman and rubin @xcite criteria and typically get @xmath52 to be less than 0.05 , which is more conservative than the recommended value @xmath530.1cdm model with step - like @xmath9 truncated at @xmath54 mpc@xmath26 , which will be shown in the later part of this paper , we have @xmath55 . ] .",

    "this may be somewhat problematic because these low multipoles suffer from relatively large cosmic variance .",
    "on the other hand , if we incorporate low @xmath1 polarization components , the optical depth @xmath8 can be determined with a smaller ambiguity because the degeneracy between @xmath9 and @xmath8 is partially removed , which in turn result in a better determination of the spectral index .",

    "we obtain different values of cosmological parameters with different datasets .",
    "for example , we find a very low @xmath7 in the combination of wmap3 ( without @xmath56 ) and sdss is rather interesting , even though we have adopted the hst prior in table 6 .",

    "@xcite    while our results as a whole support the concordance cosmology , they also indicate we are still far from being able to determine all of the six cosmological parameters with two digits accuracy in the context of this simple power - law @xmath4cdm model",
