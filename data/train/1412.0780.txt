    "the effectiveness of practically all chemotherapeutic compounds that are used in the clinical treatment of solid tumors reduces during the course of therapy @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , termed drug resistance , can arise due to a number of different intracellular and microenvironmental causes .",
    "drug resistance is not cancer - specific ; it is a common cause of treatment failure in hiv infection @xcite , and of antibiotic failure in bacterial communities @xcite .",
    "it is often impossible to determine whether the drug resistant cells existed prior to the start of treatment , or if they arose as a result of anti - cancer therapy .",
    "pre - existing ( primary ) drug resistance occurs when the tumor contains a subpopulation of drug resistant cells at the initiation of treatment , and these cells become selected for during the course of therapy .",
    "acquired resistance involves the adaptation of a tumor cell subpopulation so that the cells gradually develop drug resistance due to drug exposure and other factors , such as microenvironmental or metabolic conditions @xcite .",
    "mechanisms of drug resistance are being studied in cell culture @xcite .",
    "drug resistant cell lines are produced by incubating cells with a particular drug , collecting the surviving cell subpopulation , and repeating this process through several passages until the remaining subpopulation of cells no longer responds to the treatment . while this is an effective way to generate a resistant cell population , this _ in vitro _",
    "process does not reveal whether the surviving cells become less responsive to chemotherapeutic treatment with each cell passage ( acquired drug resistance ) , or if a small population of resistant cells was present from the beginning and simply overgrew the other cells during the course of the experiment ( pre - existing drug resistance ) .",
    "many different mechanisms can be adopted by cancer cells to resist treatment @xcite .",
    "these can broadly be divided into intrinsic ( intracellular ) causes and extrinsic ( microenvironmental ) causes .",
    "as an example of intrinsic resistance , a cancer cell arrested in a quiescent state will not respond to the killing effects of an anti - mitotic drug .",
    "other intrinsic causes of drug resistance include enhanced dna repair mechanisms , increased tolerance to dna damage , high levels of drug transporters that eliminate drug from the cell , over - expression of drug target receptor , or accumulation of cancer stem cells . among the extrinsic causes of drug resistance are factors that synergistically limit cancer cell exposure to drug .",
    "these include irregular tumor vasculature that causes chaotic drug delivery and interstitial fluid pressure that hinders drug transport .",
    "metabolic gradients inside tissue , such as regions of hypoxia or acidity , can also influence cell sensitivity to a drug @xcite .",
    "while these factors could be pre - existing , exposure to drug has also been found to affect these different factors @xcite .    to narrow down the focus of this paper ,",
    "we only consider a chemotherapeutic agent that chemically reacts with and damages cell dna . among these are drugs routinely used in the clinic , including alkylating agents ( _ cisplatin _ , _ mephalan _ ) , antimetabolites ( _ 5-fluorouracil _ , _ gemcitabine _ ) , anthracyclines ( _ doxorubicin _ ) or topoisomerase poisons ( _ etoposide _ ) .",
    "dna integrity is essential for a cell to properly function , and when increased levels of dna damage are detected at cell - cycle checkpoints , the cell can be arrested in its cell - cycle to give time for dna repair . however , in cancer cells the mechanisms of dna damage sensing can be loosened , and some cells are capable of ignoring cell - cycle checkpoints .",
    "we consider cancer cells with one or more of these features to be _ resistant _ to dna damaging drugs .",
    "these resistant cells can result in the increased proliferation and replication of the damaged dna .",
    "cancer cells can also develop resistance through increased dna repair capabilities and increased dna damage tolerance @xcite .",
    "clinically , it is generally not possible to determine which of these mechanisms result in resistance to dna damaging drugs , though all of these mechanisms have been observed experimentally .    our goal is to simulate how resistance to dna damaging drugs ( administered continuously by intravenous injection ) can emerge in individual cells and in a growing population of tumor cells . we were interested in comparing tumor dynamics in two cases : when a small subpopulation of tumor cells is already resistant to the drug ( pre - existing resistance ) and when the cells can become resistant upon exposure to the drug ( acquired resistance ) .",
    "theoretical analysis of the temporal components of the model , along with numerical simulations of the full spatial model have been performed .",
    "these analyses revealed multiple biologically - distinct parameter regimes for both pre - existing and acquired resistance . in either case",
    ", we found a parameter regime for which the effectiveness of drug is reduced during the course of treatment ( drug resistance ) .",
    "focusing on the case of pre - existing resistant cells , we quantified how their location in tissue space influences therapeutic response .",
    "when drug resistance emerges in response to treatment , we explored which clonal populations survived treatment and how this depended on their location in tissue space .",
    "moreover , we present evidence that two different microenvironmental niches , low drug / low oxygen and low drug / sufficient oxygen , have different transient and long - term impacts on cancer cell survival .",
    "we have developed a hybrid discrete - continuous model of a two - dimensional tissue slice in which a tumor grows , interacts with the microenvironment and is treated with a dna damaging drug .",
    "the pivotal role of the microenvironment in drug efficacy and resistance is strongly suggested through the observation that drugs with potent _ in vitro _",
    "activity are often significantly less effective in the clinic .",
    "we incorporate the microenvironment by considering a small patch of tissue with imposed positions of non - evolving blood vessels that serve as a source of both nutrients and drug .",
    "we track the features and behaviors of individual cells ; this includes their clonal evolution and their interactions with other cells and the surrounding microenvironment . for simplicity",
    ", we do not include any stromal cells or other extracellular components .",

    "the corresponding cell configurations are shown in fig.[fig : figcolor]c(ii ) and fig.[fig : figcolor]d(ii ) , respectively . during this time",
    "the majority of cells steadily accumulate dna damage ( fig.[fig : noresistance]b , d ) and subsequently die when the damage level exceeds the death threshold ( fig.[fig : noresistance]a(iii ) and fig.[fig : noresistance]c(iii ) ) .",
    "the exception to this is a small cell cluster located in the low drug niche ( fig.[fig : figcolor]c(iii ) and fig.[fig : figcolor]d(iii ) ) .",
    "these small subpopulations are able to briefly recover and temporarily increase tumor size ( fig.[fig : noresistance]a(iv ) , fig.[fig : figcolor]c(iv ) and fig.[fig : noresistance]c(iv ) , fig.[fig : figcolor]d(iv ) ) , although both tumors eventually die out .",
    "tumor eradication in both cases took place within several cell cycles , although the tumor initiated within the low drug niche survived slightly longer than the dispersed configuration : 9 cell cycles versus 11 cell cycles , with an average cell cycle counting 720 iterations .",
    "the main difference between these two cases is in the number of persistent clones ( one in fig.[fig : figcolor]c(iv ) and several in fig.[fig : figcolor]d(iv ) ) , which suggests that certain cell clones may be selected by microenvironmental conditions and thus survive longer .",
    "this may have implications for the development of tumor resistance since subpopulations that confer a certain advantage within the tissue may give rise to distinct resistance capabilities or indeed to a resistant phenotype .      in this section ,",
    "we theoretically analyze the damage incurred in cancer cells during treatment .",
    "we are interested in predicting the parameter regimes for which the damage accumulated by cancer cells @xmath40 exceeds their death threshold @xmath41 , as this is the situation that results in cancer cell death .    to facilitate our analysis",
    ", we first assume that each cell incurs the same amount of dna damage .",

    "a clonally heterogeneous tumor begins to grow in tissue space while , simultaneously , the average cellular dna damage level is increasing .",

    "this is what we consider to be a drug resistant tumor , and what is often observed clinically when treating patients with a chemotherapeutic agent .    in this parameter regime , the early tumor dynamics are comparable to the successful treatment case : after an initial period of time during which cancer cells build up drug levels , there is a transient period of tumor shrinkage ( fig.[fig : figpreexist]b ) .",
    "fig.[fig : figcolor]e(ii ) reveals that only three clones are selected for during this period of time : the two resistant clones ( red and blue ) , and the one sensitive clone located in a low - drug niche ( yellow ) .",

    "the drug can not eliminate the resistant cells , though it can eliminate the sensitive cell in the low drug niche .",

    "the case of @xmath193 is illustrated in fig.[fig : figacquired]a , e . within this parameter regime ,",
    "the tumor is not monotonically decreasing in size , as observed in the no resistance case and in the successful treatment of a tumor with pre - existing resistant cells case ( fig.[fig : noresistance]a ) .",
    "there is a transient period of time ( approximately five cell cycles in length ) during which the cancer cells accumulate drug but do not respond to the drug .",
    "once drug levels have caused enough dna damage , a transient period of tumor shrinkage occurs .",
    "the cancer cells that are eliminated during this period are the ones with adequate access to the drug .",
    "this period of tumor shrinkage is always followed by a period of regrowth , during which cells in the low - drug microenvironmental niche temporarily repopulate tissue space .",
    "however , this period of drug - induced resistance is transient , and the tumor is eventually eradicated by the dna damaging drug .    therefore , the model reveals that a cancer can be successfully eliminated by a dna damaging drug that induces resistance after prolonged exposure .",
    "in other words , just because the cells have the ability to acquire resistance to the drug , this does not mean a drug resistant tumor will develop .      simulations also revealed a parameter regime that was not found in the pre - existing resistance case . when @xmath58 satisfies @xmath194 , the drug shrinks the tumor to a very small number of cancer cells ( fig.[fig : figacquired]b where @xmath195 ) .",
    "the reason the tumor is not fully eradicated by treatment is because the surviving cells are all stuck in hypoxic microenvironmental niches ( not shown ) .",
    "evidence that the few cancer cells found in the hypoxic niche will survive treatment is seen in fig.[fig : figacquired]f .",
    "the average death threshold of the surviving cells is increasing ( cells are continuing to acquire resistance ) while the average damage level is decreasing ( cells are repairing more damage than they are accumulating ) .",
    "other than the persistence of a small number of hypoxic cancer cells , the dynamics observed in this parameter regime are qualitatively the same as the successful treatment parameter regime .",
    "further , since the vasculature is not evolving in our model and since the cells are not actively motile , there is no mechanism for the surviving hypoxic cells to re - enter the cell cycle and trigger tumor expansion .",
    "therefore , this is another parameter regime for which cells have the ability to acquire resistance to a dna damaging drug , but a drug resistant tumor does not develop .      computational analysis revealed that for @xmath196 , the effectiveness of the dna damaging drug is reduced over time . just as in the pre - existing case , this is what we consider a drug resistant tumor .",
    "the precise trajectory of the tumor , and its clonal composition , depends sensitively on the selected value of @xmath58 within this parameter range .",
    "for instance , when @xmath197 , there are two transient periods of tumor shrinkage before a clonally homogeneous tumor overtakes tissue space ( fig.[fig : figcolor]g ) . the one surviving tumor clone is initially located in low - drug niche in tissue space , and eventually emerges from these lower - drug regions to overtake space",
    ". this will be discussed further in section [ sec : locationacqu ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath198 , there is only one transient period of tumor shrinkage ( fig.[fig : figacquired]c ) preceding the formation of a drug resistant tumor .",
    "the spatial dynamics and clonal history of the tumor are interesting to track in this case .",
    "the growth curve in fig.[fig : figacquired]c shows a local maximum around 4000 iterations . at this point a clonally heterogeneous tumor has practically overtaken tissue space ( fig.[fig : figcolor]f(i ) ) .",
    "however , fig.[fig : figacquired]g shows that around this local maximum , the average damage level of the cancer cells catches up to the average death threshold , and this leads to a period of time during which the drug effectively reduces the tumor size . at the local minimum",
    ", some clonal diversity has been lost .",
    "most cells are found in either hypoxic or low - drug niches , although there are some cells found in normoxic zones where drug is readily accessible ( fig.[fig : figcolor]f(ii ) ) .",
    "after the tumor escapes its local minimum , the average death level of the surviving cancer cells diverges from the average damage level , and a more clonally heterogeneous tumor overtakes tissue space ( fig.[fig : figcolor]f(iii ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare this to the case of pre - existing resistance .",
    "the number of clones that survive in pre - existing drug resistant tumors is precisely the number of resistant clones present in the tumor before any treatment . in the acquired case ,",
    "the number of clones in the resistant tumor sensitively depends on the value of @xmath58 within the drug resistant parameter range .",
    "we observed that when @xmath197 only one clone survives , which is less clonally diverse than our pre - existing resistance case .",
    "@xmath198 corresponds to nine different clones surviving treatment , which is more clonally diverse than the pre - existing case ( fig.[fig : figcolor]e(iii ) ) .",
    "computational analysis reveals that when @xmath199 , the dna damaging drug fails to cause any reduction in the number of cancer cells .",
    "treatment failure occurs because the drug induces resistance in the cancer cells quicker than it damages the dna . in this parameter regime , a clonally diverse tumor overtakes tissue space , and the tumor never shrinks in response to treatment ( fig.[fig : figacquired]d , h where @xmath200 ) .",
    "the clonal composition of the tumor after 25,000 iterations of growth is comparable to the composition of a tumor grown with no treatment ( fig.[fig : figcolor]b ) .",
    "microenvironmental conditions such as the position of vasculature can influence tumor growth and heterogeneity .",
    "cells require oxygen to survive and replicate , but proximity to blood vessels also means higher exposure to drug .",
    "regions of the tissue landscape where blood vessels are far enough away to minimize drug exposure while still close enough to maintain adequate oxygen levels will facilitate tumor growth .",
    "this can already be seen in the non - resistant tumor cases ( section [ sec : nores ] ) .",
    "while both discussed tumors died out , it took longer to eradicate the tumor initiated near the microenvironmental niche of low drug concentration .",
    "moreover , this niche also gave rise to a subpopulation of cells able to recover from drug insult , although only temporarily .",
    "our tissue landscape contains a cluster of three blood vessels and an additional solitary blood vessel near the boundary of the tissue space ( fig.[fig:5_1]a ) .",
    "this leads to a low - drug / normoxic niche near the center of the tissue sample , and a low - drug / hypoxic region at much of the boundary of the region .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]      as discussed in section [ sec : preexistressimul ] , the initial condition for our pre - existing resistance simulations was a large population of sensitive cells with a subpopulation of two resistant cells ( approximately 3% of the population ) . to study how the microenvironment influences the survival and heterogeneity of tumors under this condition , we varied which two cells were chosen to be resistant .",
    "in particular , we tested three different configurations : 1 ) resistant cells chosen to be the two cells closest to blood vessels ; 2 ) resistant cells chosen at an intermediate distance from the blood vessels ; and 3 ) resistant cells chosen to be the two cells furthest from the vessels .",
    "consistent with our theoretical analysis of pre - existing resistance in section [ sec : preexistrestheory ] , we found that long - term tumor behavior was controlled by the relationship between the value of @xmath53 ( the fraction of damage repaired ) and the pre - exiting resistance parameter @xmath118 .",
    "it was only minimally influenced in the short term by the positioning of the two resistant cells in space .",
    "our simulations showed that the same three parameter regimes discussed in section [ sec : preexistressimul ] led to tumor eradication , a transient period of tumor shrinkage followed by treatment failure , and monotonic tumor growth respectively , regardless of the proximity of the two resistant cells to the vasculature ( fig.[fig:5_2 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that in the case of pre - existing resistance , just the presence of the resistant cells combined with the dna repair parameter value drives the overall tumor dynamics .",
    "the position of resistant cells , on the other hand , only serves to adjust the time scale of tumor growth or death .",
    "this suggests that pre - existing resistance is a stronger promoter of tumor growth than is a preferential microenvironment .",

    "further , the maximum value of @xmath220 we consider is @xmath120 , which also satisfies the constraint imposed by this proposition .",
    "therefore the proposition implies that for all the simulations presented in section [ sec : acquiredres ] , treatment should successfully eradicate all tumor cells . yet , this is only consistent with two of the four numerical simulations presented .",
    "the other two cases correspond to a drug resistant tumor and complete treatment failure .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the one assumption made during the theoretical analysis : we assumed that all cancer cells incur constant levels of damage at each time point during treatment ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "however , the damage incurred by a cell is actually a function of both space and time .",
    "so , if we consider the statement from the proposition that @xmath246 guarantees tumor eradication , and if we insert the fact that we use @xmath247 in our simulations , this implies that @xmath248 is needed to guarantee the tumor eradication .",
    "however , cells located at sufficient distances from the vasculature accumulate less drug than cells closer to the vasculature , and therefore incur less damage . for these cells ,",
    "the condition @xmath248 is not necessarily met , as @xmath133 will be small when drug levels are low .",
    "this phenomenon can result in the theoretical prediction ( which ignores the spatial component ) failing to match up with the numerical simulations ( which include the spatial component ) .",
    "thus , space is clearly playing a very important role in treatment response when resistance to a dna damaging drug is acquired during the course of treatment .",
    "to further understand the importance of the microenvironmental niche in the case of acquired resistance , we tracked the clonal evolution of the tumor .",
    "we found that the microenvironmental niche plays a bigger role in determining the growth and heterogeneity of the tumor when @xmath58 is not high .",
    "when @xmath58 is sufficiently small , the microenvironmental niche influences which cells survive the longest , though all cells will eventually die .",
    "cells originally located near the low - drug / normoxic niche initially accumulate damage at a much slower rate than their neighbors while still increasing their death threshold .",
    "the rest of the less favorably placed population die out first as damage exceeds the death threshold , but the benefit of the low - drug / normoxic niche enables the few remaining cells to survive longer and even experience a second short period of growth before damage overwhelms them ( section [ sec : acquiredres_success ] ) .    for mid - range values of @xmath58 , we observed the case of _ almost successful treatment _ discussed in section [ sec : acquiredres_almostsuccess ] .",
    "this behavior is driven by the microenvironmental niche .",
    "cells initially placed near the low - drug / normoxic niche are selected for , and the increase in @xmath58 lends them the time needed to reproduce enough to move the tumor mass toward the hypoxic region . the result is a colony of a few surviving hypoxic cells descended from the parent cells initially placed in the low drug niches .",
    "when @xmath58 is at a higher value , the microenvironmental niche also determines which cells survive . in this case , however , the surviving cells actually result in treatment failure .",
    "the tumor that eventually takes over tissue space lacks clonal diversity .",
    "the selective powers of the microenvironmental niche are highlighted in fig.[fig : figcolor]g .",
    "the first period of selection occurs after a clonally heterogeneous tumor starts to overtake tissue space .",
    "essentially all cells , with the exception of those in low - drug niches , accumulate high enough damage levels to be killed by the drug ( fig.[fig : figcolor]g(iii ) ) .",
    "the tumor temporarily repopulates some of space from these low - drug regions , but again experiences a period of die - off when cells enter higher - drug regions .",
    "the cells that survive this selection process are mostly found in a low - drug / hypoxic niche , and it is these cells that eventually result in a clonally homogeneous tumor repopulating tissue space ( fig.[fig : figcolor]g(v , vi ) ) .    for large values of @xmath58 ,",
    "however , the role of the microenvironmental niche is reduced .",
    "the cancer cells develop resistance to the drug very quickly for sufficiently large @xmath58 .",
    "as few clones die out , this results in a monotonically growing tumor ( fig.[fig : figacquired]d ) composed of clones from all over the tissue landscape , similar to what is observed in the case of no treatment ( fig.[fig : figcolor]b ) .    in conclusion , the microenvironmental",
    "niche plays different roles for different values of @xmath58 , the rate at which cells build up tolerance to the dna damaging drug .",
    "when it is small , the microenvironment selects which cells will survive the longest before ultimately dying . as @xmath58 increases to mid - range values ,",
    "cells located near the low - drug / normoxic niche are able to develop resistance and propagate , eventually leading to the formation of a resistant tumor . for large values of @xmath58",
    ", location becomes less important and cell survival is guaranteed by the increase of the death threshold alone .",
    "in this paper we addressed the emergence of a resistant tumor when a dna damaging drug is continuously administered by an intravenous injection .",
    "we have developed a spatial agent - based model that can examine tumor response to the drug in a heterogeneous microenvironment .",
    "this environment is comprised of non - uniformly spaced vasculature that results in an irregular gradient of oxygen and drug .",
    "we specifically focused on the difference between pre - existing and acquired drug resistance . by using identical initial microenvironmental conditions we were able to compare the dynamics and clonal evolution of the developing tumor in these two cases .",
    "we have also conducted a theoretical analysis of the temporal components of the model for both types of resistance .",
    "the model produced several interesting results . in both cases considered ,",
    "the pre - existing or acquired drug resistance is initiated independently in individual cells ( cellular level ) .",
    "however , during the course of treatment three types of population behaviors ( tissue level ) are observed : 1 ) tumor eradication ; 2 ) emergence of a drug resistant tumor ; and 3 ) a non - responsive tumor . in order to observe these three parameter regimes in the case of pre - existing resistance , dna damage repair",
    "must be included in the model ( @xmath249 ) .",
    "varying the pre - existing resistance parameter ( @xmath118 ) without including dna damage repair can only give rise to the case of tumor eradication ( proposition [ proposition1].1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of acquired resistance all three parameter regimes are achievable without the inclusion of dna damage repair .",
    "final tumor behavior in this case depends on the speed with which the cells build tolerance to dna damage ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "in particular , in the cases with pre - existing resistance , both the theoretical analysis and the agent - based simulations produced the same conclusions : a ) with a low dna damage repair term , both the resistant and sensitive clones died ; b ) with a medium dna damage repair term , resistant clones survived but sensitive clones died ; and c ) for high levels of the dna damage repair term , all clones survived regardless of their phenotype .",
    "the reason for this correlation between computational simulations and theoretical analysis is that in the pre - existing resistance case , the spatial component has no significant effect on the long - term outcome .",
    "similarly , in the acquired resistance case : a ) with a slow increase in the cell death threshold , all of the cells eventually died out ; b ) with an intermediate increase in the death threshold , some of the clones die but the tumor eventually develops resistance to the drug ; and c ) with a high increase in the cell death threshold , all clones are able to survive resulting in treatment failure .    in the cases where",
    "a drug resistant tumor forms ( fig.[fig : figcolor]g , h ) , some common spatial dynamics are observed .",
    "the cells located near vasculature are first affected by the drug and often die .",
    "the least affected are the cells that occupy low drug / normoxia niches , and these cells are often able to repopulate the tumor .",
    "final clonal configurations can vary from mono - clonal ( acquired case ) to bi - clonal ( pre - existing case ) , to multi - clonal ( acquired case ) .",
    "however , in the case of acquired resistance , we have also observed a case when only a small number of cells remained quiescent in the hypoxic areas for a prolonged time .",
    "these cells have not accumulated enough damage to die , and since they are located in the area of both low drug and oxygen , they have time for dna repair .",
    "thus , the existence of microenvironmental niches of either low drug or low oxygen concentrations are the driving forces in both transient and long - term tumor cell survival .",
    "further , in the case of acquired resistance , the spatial location of certain clones makes them more fit than the other cells and allows them to overtake the available space . in conclusion , when the cell has a pre - existing resistance the genetic fitness advantage seems to be more important than any spatial fitness advantage , whereas the spatial position of tumor clones plays a more important role when drug resistance is acquired .    when studying the case of acquired resistance we assumed that all cells react to drug exposure in the same way and are thus all equally capable of acquiring resistance .",
    "this choice allowed us to focus on how microenvironmental differences select which cells acquire resistance , but our model could also be extended to take into account intrinsic cellular differences . in particular , it is possible that acquired drug resistance occurs when only a single cell , rather than the whole population , possesses the ability to acquire resistance .",
    "investigating the interaction of cellular and microenvironmental differences is an interesting problem , especially because our simulations show that varying how strongly cells respond to drug exposure ( @xmath58 ) can lead to clonally heterogeneous or homogenous tumors . since we framed acquired resistance broadly as a reaction of cells to increased and prolonged exposure to drug , it is possible to use this general framework to account for a variety of the mechanisms of acquired resistance .",
    "for example , resistance may be due to increased drug efflux pumps or a simple lack of any drug dosage effect . both of these mechanisms could be studied with our model by changing how we think about the damage level and death threshold .",
    "the damage level is related to how much drug the cell has encountered , and the death threshold at its most general level describes how the cell reacts to damage .",
    "thus , it is possible that the cell reacts to damage less ( and hence has a higher death threshold ) because of enhanced drug efflux pumps or a less effective drug .",
    "our model can also be extended to address other important aspects of tumor resistance . in this paper",
    ", we limited our investigation to a continuously administered drug . in the future",
    "we will investigate different drug scheduling schemes including typical clinical protocols , as well as metronomic and adaptive schedules . beyond the drug schedule",
    ", we can expand the model from considering dna damaging drugs to considering other drugs with different killing mechanisms , including anti - mitotic drugs or drugs activated in specific microenvironmental conditions ( low oxygen or high acidosis ) .",
    "this allow us to further extend our model to study drug combinations .",
    "this is especially important , because in clinical practice , when the tumor cells become resistant to a given drug , the treatment is often changed to another therapeutic agent .",
    "however , it has been observed that resistance to one drug is accompanied by resistance to other drugs whose structures and mechanisms of action may be completely different ( multiple drug resistance ) . thus , this poses interesting questions for future research . if the hypothesis of a pre - existing population of resistant cells is true , what mechanisms enable those cells to resist the drug action of the often multiple chemotherapeutic treatments that may be given to a patient sequentially or in parallel ? if the hypothesis of gradual emergence of drug resistance is true , what factors contribute to the development of acquired drug resistance ?",
    "the mathematical framework developed here has the potential to address multiple aspects of drug resistance in solid tumors and test methods for increasing efficacy of drug combinations .",
    "our model belongs to a category of spatial hybrid discrete - continuous models of anti - cancer drug resistance .",
    "while mathematical modeling of tumor growth and therapy ( mathematical oncology ) dates back now over half a century @xcite , the modeling of anti - cancer drug resistance have gained its momentum in the last couple of years @xcite . however , most of the mathematical models to date addressed the problem of drug resistance on a level of the whole cell population using a variety of mathematical approaches : stochastic models @xcite , evolutionary dynamics @xcite , game theory @xcite , lamarckian induction @xcite , compartmental pharmacokinetic models @xcite , or continuous pde models @xcite .",

    "this work showed that administration of the chemotherapy with the goal of stabilization of tumor size instead of eradication would yield better results than use of maximum tolerated doses , thus preventing or at least delaying tumor relapse .",
    "the authors demonstrated that fast growing sensitive cells can serve as a shield keeping the resistant cells trapped inside the tumor .",
    "et al _ used a continuous model of anti - cancer therapy resistance under the assumption that resistance is induced by adaptation to drug environmental pressures @xcite .",

    "the same group has also considered how the spatial structure plays a role in resistance development under combined therapy protocols . by including spatial structure into the model ,",
    "the authors were able to suggest that adaptation to local conditions ( microenvironment ) is directly linked to resistance development @xcite .",
    "et al _ used another continuous model of multi - drug resistance with a variable cell resistance level that takes the form of a structure population model .",
    "this allowed the authors to explore how cells evolve ( and may be selected for ) under stress imposed by cytotoxic drugs @xcite .",

    "the authors suggested that cell - cycle - mediated drug resistance emerges because the chemotherapeutic treatment gives rise to a dominant , slow - cycling subpopulation of tumor cells , causing the drug failing to target all cancer cells .",
    "our model differs significantly from the models discussed above .",
    "we not only consider and compare two types of resistance , but also identify two microenvironmental niches that have an impact on emergence of resistant cells .",
    "while other hybrid models use similar approach to model tumor cell interactions with oxygen and drugs , they treat tumor microenvironment as a homogeneous medium @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our model incorporates a more realistic configuration of tumor vasculature that produces gradients of metabolites that are of irregular shapes and can change dynamically in time .",
    "thus we can directly observe the emergence of microenvironmental niches ( fig.[fig : figcolor]g(iii),(iv ) ) that protect cells from killing by drugs , and enable some of them to develop resistance .",
    "we also investigated the interplay between tumor clonal development within the spatially and temporally variable distributions of both drug and oxygen , that has not been addressed by any of the previous hybrid models of drug resistance .",
    "the presented model is quite general and the self - calibration methods have been used for it parameterization ( see the appendix ) .",
    "our model reproduces a broad range of tumor behaviors observed in clinical practice .",
    "however , our chosen parameters have not been tuned to represent a particular drug and a particular tumor type .",
    "therefore the model constitutes a good starting point for more precise calibration to both tumor morphology and drug pharmacokinetic properties . in particular , in the future",
    "we plan to use more realistic tumor tissue morphologies based on patients histology samples .",
    "this will include both more realistic vasculature that may vary between tumors of different origins , various stromal components such as stromal cells ( fibroblasts or adipocytes ) and immune cells ( macrophages , t cells , lymphocytes ) , extracellular matrix fibril structure , and various distributions of metabolites ( oxygen , glucose , acids , mmps ) .",
    "in particular , the role of the tumor microenvironment in the development of drug resistance is becoming a key consideration in the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents .",
    "the interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding physical environment can influence cell signaling , survival , proliferative capacities and cell sensitivity to drugs .",
    "thus extracellular factors including tumor hypoxia and acidity , as well as tumor cell density and the extracellular matrix composition that limit drug penetration , should be investigated in a quantitative way via combination of laboratory experimentaion and mathematical modeling .",
    "we thank drs .",
    "ami radunskaya and trachette jackson for organizing the wham ! research collaboration workshop for women in applied mathematics , dynamical systems and applications to biology and medicine , that allowed us to initiate this research project , and the institute for mathematics and its applications ( i m a ) for a generous support during the wham ! workshop and reunion meetings .",
    "we also acknowledge the german research foundation ( deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft , dfg ) for the travel grant ( ce 243/1 - 1 ) .    before testing various mechanism of tumor resistance ,",
    "our model has been calibrated to 1 ) achieve a stable gradient of oxygen when no cancer cells are present , as would be the case in healthy tissue ; 2 ) generate a tumor cluster that completely fills the available space when no drug is applied as would take place in non - treated tumors ; this will result in another stable gradient of oxygen with hypoxic areas located far from the vasculature ; and 3 ) completely eliminate the tumor when the cells do not acquire resistance .",
    "these three self - calibration steps are discussed in this section .      first , the influence of oxygen and drug are normalized so that @xmath4=@xmath28=@xmath250",
    ". then we determine the oxygen diffusion coefficient @xmath5 and oxygen boundary conditions that lead to a ( numerically ) stable gradient of oxygen when no cancer cells are present ; that is with no cellular uptake .",
    "several boundary conditions were considered , however , the best results in terms of irregular gradient stabilization and the extent of hypoxic areas were achieved for the sink - like conditions with @xmath251=0.45 ( see section [ sec : oxyequ ] ) .",
    "the resulting stable oxygen gradient is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figappendix]a and the relative 2-norm error between two oxygen concentrations generated in two consecutive time steps is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figappendix]c .",
    "the obtained oxygen gradient served as an initial condition for the reaction - diffusion equation for oxygen .",
    "next , a tumor cell oxygen uptake rate @xmath252 and a hypoxia threshold @xmath52 were selected to allow for tumor growth with a small subpopulation of hypoxic cells , and for generation of a ( numerically ) stable gradient of oxygen when the tumor reaches its stable configuration .",
    "this population of tumor cells , including the hypoxic cell fraction and tumor clonal composition , serves as a control case ( with no treatment ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figcolor]b . for the stable tumor population the ( numerically ) stable oxygen gradient",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figappendix]b , and the relative @xmath253-norm error of the oxygen changes over @xmath254 iterations is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : figappendix]d .",
    "finally , the drug diffusion coefficient @xmath23 , drug uptake rate @xmath255 , and death threshold @xmath56 were determined so that the cluster of tumor cells with no resistance is eradicated .",
    "this ensures that for the chosen drug parameters , the drug is effective when there are no resistant tumor cells .",
