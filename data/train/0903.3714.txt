    "9 , the dust temperature decreases monotonically from @xmath51000 k at the inner radius to @xmath550 k at the outer radius of the dust envelope , even though there is a jump in mass loss rate between the inner hot dust shell and the outer cooler dust shell at a radial distance of 1.8 10@xmath21 cm .    from the flux @xmath58 of the radiation field at each point in the envelope",
    "we can define the flux average extinction coefficient @xmath45 , which characterizes the transfer of angular momentum from radiation photons to dust particles during the absorption and reemission processes of the continuum radiation . because in our case we do not consider the scattering of radiation , the extinction coefficient @xmath59 is simply the opacity @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "@xmath62 the flux average extinction coefficient @xmath45 changes significantly in the inner part of the dust envelope but reaches a constant value in the outer part .",
    "because the molecular shells are located in the outer part of the dust envelope , at radii larger than a few times 10@xmath21 cm , for simplicity , we will adopt a constant value @xmath45=0.025 ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "the temperature of the molecular gas at any point in the envelope is determined by the balance between cooling due to adiabatic expansion and molecular emissions , and the heating , which is mainly due to collisions of molecules with dust grains ( goldreich & scoville 1976 ) . as the dust grains stream through the gas under radiation pressure , the grains transfer angular momentum to the gas by collisions .",
    "the heating term is therefore directly related to the drift velocity : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number density of dust particles .",
    "the drift velocity is determined by the relation : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath67 is the expansion velocity , @xmath27 is the mass loss rate , and @xmath68 is the speed of light , @xmath45 is the flux average extinction coefficient of dust particles estimated in previous section .",
    "the same dust to gas ratio of @xmath52 = 5 10@xmath53 is used to calculate the heating rate .",
    "generally , in oxygen - rich envelopes the main coolants are h@xmath12o and co molecules .",
    "the contribution of h@xmath12o molecules to the cooling process in irc+10420 is quite uncertain .",
    "we note that far - ir emission lines of h@xmath12o are not detected in the iso data ( molster et al .",
    "in addition , oh masers are seen in a shell of radius 1 to 1.5 arcsec ( nedoluha & bowers 1992 ) .",
    "because oh radical is the photodissociation product of h@xmath12o , it is likely that h@xmath12o molecules can only exist at even smaller radii , i.e. inside the central cavity disccused previously .",
    "therefore , we do not expect the h@xmath12o molecules to be present in significant quantity in the part of the molecular envelope traced in co emission as a result , we do not include the cooling due to the h@xmath12o molecule in our model and calculate the cooling solely due to co molecule and its isotopomer @xmath1co .",
    "we use the thermal balance and radiative transfer model published by dinh - v - trung & nguyen - q - rieu ( 2000 ) to derive the temperature profile of the molecular gas and to calculate the excitation of co molecules and predict the strength of co rotational transitions .",
    "we take into account all rotational levels of co molecules up to j=20 .",
    "the collisional cross sections with h@xmath12 are taken from flower ( 2001 ) , assuming an ortho to para ratio of 3 for molecular hydrogen .",
    "the local linewidth is determined by the turbulence velocity and the local thermal linewidth .",
    "because the expansion velocity of the gas in the envelope of irc+10420 is large and the observed co line profiles have smooth slopes at both blueshifted and redshifted edges ( see figure 11 ) , we need to assume a constant turbulence velocity of 3 . we note that this is higher than normally used ( about 1 ) for the envelope around agb stars where the expansion velocity is lower ( justtanont et al .",
    "1994 ) . in our model , the spherical envelope is covered with a grid of 90 radial points . for each rotational transition ,",
    "the radiative transfer equation is integrated accurately through the envelope to determine the average radiation field at each radial mesh point .",
    "we use the approximate lambda operator method together with ng - acceleration to update the populations of co molecules of different energy levels .",

    "the size and location of each molecular shell are determined from fits to the interferometric data . in our model",
    "we adjust both the mass loss rates and the relative abundance of co molecules in the two molecular shells to match both the single dish and interferometric data .",
    "we find that a relatively low mass loss rate similar to that derived by castro - carrizo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) would result in a too high gas temperature in the envelope as the heating term becomes more dominant in comparison to the cooling term .",
    "we also find that a high abundance of co of a few times 10@xmath6 as usually used for oxygen rich envelopes ( kemper et al .",
    "2003 , castro - carrizo et al .",
    "2007 ) would result in co lines that are too strong .",
    "instead , a relative abundance of 10@xmath6 for co molecules with respect to h@xmath12 for the co molecules provides reasonable fit to all the available data .",
    "the radial profile of the gas temperature is shown in figure 10 .",
    "the sudden jump in gas temperature at the inner radius of the second shell ( @xmath51.85 10@xmath13 cm ) is due to the change in the mass loss rate .",
    "we can see that the gas temperature in the envelope of irc+10420 , although lower than assumed in castro - carrizo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , is higher than that typically found in circumstellar envelopes . even at the outermost radius of the envelope ,",
    "the gas temperature is still around 50 k. for comparison , in the envelope around oh / ir stars , the gas temperature at similar radial distances from the central star is predicted to be much lower , 10 k or even less ( justtanont et al .",
    "1994 , groenewegen 1994 ) .",
    "the main reason for the elevated gas temperature in the envelope of irc+10420 is the strong heating due to the enormous luminosity of the central yellow hypergiant .",
    "the cooling due to molecular emissions is also affected by the lower abundance of co , that we find neccessary to match the data .",
    "a summary of the parameters used in our model is presented in table 3 .",
    "as shown in figures 1114 , the results of our model are in reasonable agreement with both the strengths of co lines measured by single dish telescopes and the radial distribution of brightness temperature of j=10 and j=21 lines observed with interferometers .",
    "we note that except for the extra emission in the blue part of the line profile between 65 and 75 , the shape of the j=21 and j=32 is in close agreement with observation .",
    "higher transitions j=43 and 65 show some evidence of narrower linewidth than predicted by the model .",
    "one possible explanation is that the expansion velocity in the inner region traced by these high lying transitions has slightly lower expansion velocity than in the outer part of the envelope .    by comparing the model predictions with the strengths of @xmath1co j=10 and j=21 lines observed with the iram 30 m telescope ( bujarrabal et al . 2001 )",
    ", we derive a relative abundance for @xmath1co / h@xmath12 of 1.5 10@xmath54 , or an isotopic ratio @xmath0c/@xmath1c @xmath5 6 .",
    "this ratio is very similar to the values @xmath0c/@xmath1c = 6 and 12 , respectively , found in the red supergiants @xmath10 ori and @xmath10 sco ( harris & lambert 1984 , hinkle et al .",
    "such a low isotopic ratio suggests that irc+10420 has experienced significant mixing of h burning products to its surface prior to the ejection of the material in the envelope .",
    "the difference between the mass - loss rates and gas temperature profile derived from our modelling and that obtained by castro - carrizo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) can be understood as the consequence of the higher gas temperature and higher co abundance adopted in their work .",
    "for the same strength of the co rotational lines , the higher co abundance can be almost exactly compensated by a corresponding decrease in the mass loss rate .",
    "our results indicate the presence of two separate shells ( shell i and shell ii , see table 3 ) with slightly different mass loss rates . with an expansion velocity of 38 ,",
    "the time interval between the two shells is @xmath5 200 yrs . the cavity inside shell i also implies a dramatic decrease in mass loss from irc+10420 over the last @xmath5300 yrs .",
    "thus irc+10420 loses mass in intense bursts , separated by relatively quiet periods of a few hundreds years in duration .",
    "lll + parameters & shell i & shell ii + inner radius & 3.5 10@xmath21 cm & 1.85 10@xmath13 cm + outer radius & 1.5 10@xmath13 cm & 5 10@xmath13 cm + mass loss rate m & 9 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 & 7 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 + expansion velocity v@xmath26 & 38 kms@xmath8 & 38 kms@xmath8 + dust to gas ratio @xmath52 & 5 10@xmath53 & 5 10@xmath53 + momentum transfer coefficient @xmath45 & 0.025 & 0.025 + @xmath0co / h@xmath12 & 10@xmath6 & 10@xmath6 + @xmath1co / h@xmath12 & 1.5 10@xmath54 & 1.5 10@xmath54 + turbulent velocity & 3 kms@xmath8 & 3 kms@xmath8 +      in our model we consider separately the dust and gas component in the envelope of irc+10420 . the dust continuum emission model is used as a simple way to estimate the @xmath45 parameter of dust particles , which is needed for the thermal balance calculation in the molecular shells .",
    "it turned out that the mass loss rates of the molecular shells between 9 10@xmath6 m@xmath7/yr for shell i and 7 10@xmath6 m@xmath7/yr for shell ii are lower but quite close to the mass loss rate of 1.2 10@xmath53 m@xmath7/yr of the cool outer dust shell inferred from the modelling the sed of the envelope .",
    "our approach , although less ad hoc than simply assuming a value of the @xmath45 parameter for dust particles , is not fully self - consistent in the treatment of the dust and gas component .",
    "it would be desirable in the future to treat both the dust and gas component together when high angular resolution data on the dust continuum emission and higher j lines of co become available .",
    "another caveat of our model is the assumption that the heating of molecular gas is mainly due to collision between dust particles and gas molecules .",
    "the high luminosity of the central star of irc+10420 suggests that radiation pressure on dust particles is a possible mechanism for driving the wind as assumed in our mode .",
    "however , given the high expansion velocity and the presence of many small scale features in high angular resolution optical images of the envelope ( humphreys et al .",
    "1997 ) , which has been interpreted as jets or condensations , other mechanisms such as shocks produced by interaction between higher velocity ejecta and the envelope should be considered .",
    "the heating due shocks within the envelope might contribute to the thermal balance of the molecular gas in irc+10420 .",
    "the circumstellar envelope around irc+10420 is known to be very complex , with a number of peculiar structures ( humphreys et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the outer part of the envelope at radial distance of @xmath53",
    "to 6 , several arc - like features can be seen .",
    "these features have been interpreted as representing different mass loss episodes of irc+10420 .",
    "in addition , condensations or blobs are seen closer ( about 1 to 2 in radius ) to the central star .",
    "that might represent a more recent mass loss episode .",
    "these features correspond spatially to the two molecular shells ( shell i and ii ) identified in our observations . in addition , humphreys et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also identified several broad fan - shaped features to the south - west side of the central star , between radius of 0``.5 to 2 '' . from their higher surface brightness in comparison with other parts of the envelope , humphrey et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that these features are ejecta moving obliquely toward the observer .",
    "as discussed in previous section , the channel maps of @xmath1co j=21 and so j@xmath2=6@xmath35@xmath4 ( figures 5 and 6 ) reveal enhanced emissions in blueshifted velocity channels together with a positional shift of the emission centroid also to the south - west quadrant of the envelope .",
    "therefore , the spatial kinematics obtained from our observations and the properties of these fan - shaped features are consistent with the presence of an ejecta in the south - west side of the envelope around irc+10420 .",
    "we have used the sub - millimeter array to image and study the structure of the molecular envelope around irc+10420 .",
    "our observations reveal a large expanding envelope with a clumpy and very complex structure .",
    "the envelope shows clear asymmetry in @xmath0co j=21 emission in the south - west direction at position angle pa@xmath570@xmath38 .",
    "the elongation of the envelope is found even more pronounced in the emission of @xmath1co j=21 and so j@xmath2=6@xmath35@xmath4 .",
    "a positional shift with velocity is seen in the above emission lines , suggesting the presence of a weak bipolar outflow in the envelope of irc+10420 .    in the higher resolution data of @xmath0co j=21 , we find that the envelope has two components : ( 1 ) a inner shell ( shell i ) located between radius of about 1``-2 '' ; ( 2 ) an outer shell ( shell ii ) between radius 3 `` to 6 '' .",
    "these shells represernt two previous mass loss episodes from irc+10420 .",
    "we constrain the physical conditions inside the envelope by modelling the dust properties , the heating and cooling of molecular gas . from comparison with observations",
    "we derive the size and the location of each molecular shell .",
    "we estimate a mass loss rate of @xmath5 9 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 for shell i and 7 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 for shell ii . the gas temperature is found to be an usually high in irc+10420 in comparison with other oxygen rich envelopes , mainly due to the large heating induced by the large luminosity of the central star .",
