    "the 3.2-ms pulsar was discovered as part of the green bank north celestial cap ( gbncc ) survey ( stovall et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . )",
    " a survey of the sky north of declination @xmath6 at 350mhz with the 100-m robert c.  byrd green bank telescope  in a pointing selected for being coincident with an unclassified _ fermi _",
    "@xmath1-ray source ( a successful search strategy , as shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others ) . shortly after discovery",
    ", it was realized that the radio data showed evidence for acceleration in an @xmath7hr circular orbit with eclipses lasting up to 10% of the orbit at 350mhz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timephot ] ) .",
    "eclipsing millisecond pulsars , especially those with @xmath1-ray counterparts , are often associated with `` black - widow '' or `` redback '' systems .",
    "these systems harbor low - mass companions ( @xmath8 for black - widows and @xmath9 for redbacks ; @xcite ) and have been discovered with increasing frequency in recent years ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , often in globular clusters .",
    "the eclipses are typically long ( they can cover most of the orbit ; @xcite ) , implying eclipsing regions larger than the roche lobes of the companions , and there are regions of the orbit where the pulsar is seen through ionized plasma that delays the pulses compared to the expected ephemeris .",
    "the basic model for these sources is one in which the energetic wind from the pulsar irradiates and ablates the companion , leading to long eclipses from ionized material in the systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the companions are usually tidally distorted , filling a significant fraction of their roche lobes @xcite , which along with heating from the pulsar s wind leads to significant ( often @xmath10mag at wavelengths of around 5000 ) optical modulation .",
    "such systems are interesting both because they provide a probe of the interaction between the pulsar s wind and the companion and , ultimately , because such systems allow measurement of neutron star masses through binary modeling @xcite .    here",
    "we report on new and archival optical and ultraviolet data on the counterpart of psr  j1816 + 4510 .",
    "we use these data , along with archival @xmath1-ray data from the _ fermi _  spacecraft , to constrain the nature of the psr  j1816 + 4510  system .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we first describe the archival optical and ultraviolet data that we used to identify the counterpart to psr  j1816 + 4510  (   [ sec : arch ] ) , and then we discuss new optical data from the wisconsin indiana yale noao telescope (   [ sec : new ] ) .",
    "we fit the optical / ultraviolet spectral energy distribution in   [ sec : sed ] .",
    "we then discuss the _ fermi _",
    "@xmath1-ray data (   [ sec : fermi ] ) and the _ swift _  x - ray upper limits (   [ sec : swift ] ) . finally , we discuss the implications of our data in   [ sec : disc ] , and conclude in ",

    "we make use of the radio ephemeris for psr  j1816 + 4510  determined by stovall et al .",
    "( 2012 ) : position @xmath11 @xmath12 ( j2000 ) , binary period @xmath13hr , and minimum companion mass @xmath14 ( assuming a neutron star mass of @xmath15 , although a somewhat more massive neutron star may be likely given likely accretion histories ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a companion mass would put it among the `` redback '' class @xcite , although if the companion is more degenerate it might instead contain a he - core white dwarf such as that in the system @xcite . if the orbit is edge - on , then the full semi - major axis is @xmath16 with a roche - lobe radius @xmath17 ( based on @xcite ) .",
    "the dispersion - measure ( dm ) distance is 2.4kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a dm of @xmath18 ) , although given the high galactic latitude ( @xmath19 ) the uncertainties are large and this could be an underestimate @xcite .",
    "therefore we approximate the distance as 2kpc and parameterize it as @xmath20kpc , with a nominal value of @xmath21 . in what follows , other fundamental parameters for psr  j1816",
    "+ 4510  that are not explicitly cited are based on stovall et al .",
    "we initially identified a potential counterpart to psr  j1816 + 4510  in the usno - b1.0 survey @xcite : the star 1351 - 0294859 is at @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "this is @xmath24 from the radio position , reasonably consistent with typical astrometric accuracy from the usno catalog .",
    "however , the mean epoch of those data is 1974 , so a small proper motion could also account for some of the difference .",
    "the photometry for this source is presented in table  [ tab : phot ] , where we have assumed uncertainties of 0.2mag for the digitized sky survey ( dss ) photometry .",
    "the same source is identified in the catalina surveys data release 1 ( csdr1 ; @xcite ) catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ) .",
    "the automated software actually identified _ two _ sources that make up the counterpart : css  j181635.9 + 451033 and css  j181635.9 + 451036 .",
    "these sources are quite close ( @xmath25 apart , which is comparable to the plate - scale of the instrument ) and they both have the same average magnitude of @xmath26mag , measured with an unfiltered detector .",
    "there were no images where both sources were seen at the same time , and comparing the positions of individual detections ( rather than the average positions in the catalog ) it seems they are the same source that was split by the photometric pipeline into two .",
    "the photometry of the combined source ( 106 measurements over 6.5yr ,",
    "from 2005  may to 2011  november ) is largely consistent with being constant , except for 8 points .",
    "three of those are clearly when the software mis - identified a slightly brighter ( @xmath27mag ) star about @xmath28 to the south east ( visible in figure  [ fig : image ] ) as being part of this object .",
    "the others are not as easy to reject , but since they also have @xmath27mag we think it likely that it was another mis - identification or a photometric artifact ; without the images we can not be certain . excluding those 8 points we have data consistent with a constant @xmath29mag with root - mean - square variations of @xmath30mag .",
    "the @xmath31 relative to a constant model is slightly high ( 156.1 for 97 degrees of freedom ) , but is similar to that for a star of similar brightness @xmath32 away .",
    "there is no evidence for any secular trends in the photometry .",
    "the uncertainty on the mean magnitude is about 2mmag , but for absolute photometry we transform from the unfiltered instrumental magnitude to cousins @xmath33 by @xmath34 with a scatter of 0.06mag .",
    "since this object has very nearly @xmath35 ( this assumes that the colors are constant over time and orbital phase ) , we find @xmath36 , although this uncertainty may be somewhat underestimated .",
    "we then identified the same source in the _ galex _  all - sky imaging survey ( ais ; @xcite ) database . here , the source is  and its position is offset by @xmath24 relative to the radio position , which is consistent with the median offset of @xmath37 found for _",
    "galex_. again , photometry is presented in table  [ tab : phot ] .    in the usno source catalog ,",
    "the average density of sources brighter than @xmath38mag is @xmath39 , so the false association rate given the measured source offset is @xmath40 , making it very likely that we have the correct counterpart .",
    "moreover , the presence of a _ galex _  source at the same position with a significant far - uv ( fuv ; 152 nm ) detection makes it essentially certain : there are only 4 fuv detections with magnitudes brighter than 19.9mag within a @xmath41 radius , so the false association rate is @xmath42 . as we will see below ,",
    "this source is so bright and blue that it is rather unusual , making the chance of finding one within @xmath43 of the radio position by chance extremely low .",
    "we then identified an observation with the _ swift _  satellite ( observation i d 00041440003 ) .",
    "we see a bright source at the radio position in the data from the ultraviolet and optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observation was on 2010  august  04 , and consisted of 8 separate integrations in the @xmath44 filter ( central wavelength of 3450 ) spread over 11hours with a total integration of 3173s and @xmath45pixel binning .",
    "we determined both time - resolved and summed photometry from these data using _ swift _  data - reduction tools .",
    "first , we ran the task ` uvotsource ` on each separate observation ( along with respective exposure maps ) to measure how bright the object was in each individual integration ( with the 2011  october  31 calibration database ) .",
    "we then summed the integrations using ` uvotimsum ` and measured the summed magnitude using ` uvotsource ` , where in both cases the source region was a circle with @xmath46 radius centered on the radio position and the background region is @xmath47 in radius centered near the pulsar but not including any visible sources .",
    "the best - fit position of the source is @xmath48 , @xmath49 , or @xmath50 away from the radio position .",
    "this is without any additional boresight correction beyond that applied by the _ swift",
    "_  processing .",
    "the final detection significance in the summed image was 72.8@xmath51 , but our photometry includes the suggested systematic uncertainty of 0.02mag in addition to the statistical uncertainty .    in figure",
    "[ fig : timephot ] we show the measured _ swift _  and crts photometry as a function of orbital phase , where the _ swift _  observation times have been corrected to the solar system barycenter using the ` barycorr ` task , and the crts observation times have been corrected to the heliocenter using the ` rvcorr ` task in ` iraf ` ( for an 8-hr orbit , the differences between helio- and bary - center are negligible ) .",
    "the _ swift _  data are consistent with no variations , with @xmath52 for 7 degrees - of - freedom .",
    "each individual measurement can largely be considered instantaneous , as the exposure times are at most 800s compared to an observation duration of 11h and an orbital period of 8.7h .",
    "the rms scatter of the data about the mean is 0.05mag .",
    "the crts data have been binned , with between 2 and 16 individual observations averaged into each point .",
    "there may be a trend with orbital phase , such that the data are slightly ( 15% ) fainter near phases of 0.75 , but while formally significant ( @xmath53 for 14 degrees - of - freedom ) we do not know the level of systematic uncertainties due to artifacts and mis - identifications .",
    "there were no measurements in the bin just before the apparent flux minimum , but without the raw data we can not say whether there were no observations or just no detections .",
    "the rms scatter of the data about the mean is 0.08mag .",
    "the possible trend in the crts data is not necessarily seen in the _ swift _  data , although it is difficult to be certain .",
    "we observed psr  j1816 + 4510  using the mini - mosaic imager ( minimo ) on the 3.5-m wisconsin indiana yale noao ( wiyn ) telescope @xcite .",
    "the data were a 300s exposure in the harris-@xmath54 filter on 2011  march  24 taken shortly before sunrise .",
    "seeing was @xmath55 , with a plate - scale of @xmath56 .",
    "the data were corrected for bias level and flatfielded using standard procedures in ` midas ` .",
    "the image was registered to the international coordinate reference frame ( icrf ) using 130 two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) stars , giving fits with rms residuals of @xmath57 in each coordinate .",
    "we did photometric calibration using an observation of the landolt 98 field @xcite earlier in the night , determining a zero - point using 22 stars ; we estimate a zero - point uncertainty of 0.03mag . as in the other data , there was a bright source at the position of the pulsar , but here the position offset was only @xmath58 .",
    "we measured the object using ` sextractor ` @xcite , with the same settings that we used for the standard stars .",
    "in addition to the potential counterpart , we see some faint structure to the north - east and south - west , at distances of @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "this may just be some faint stars near the detection limit of the image , but they are also somewhat suggestive of an h@xmath61 bowshock nebula such as that seen around the black - widow system @xcite or around the non - interacting pulsar / white dwarf binary @xcite .",
    "images of both the wiyn and _ swift _  data are shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the potential counterpart of psr  j1816 + 4510  is very blue compared to nearby sources . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd ] we show a color - magnitude diagram using the @xmath54-band and @xmath44-band data , where the counterpart is roughly 1 magnitude bluer than the field sources . just the @xmath44 and @xmath54 data indicate a rather hot blackbody , although since the reddening vector is roughly parallel to the track of a blackbody the temperature and reddening are degenerate .",
    "however , some temperature above 10,000k is required .",
    "we fit all of the optical / uv photometry to determine the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this source . for the data in the vega system",
    ", we used zero - point fluxes from @xcite .",
    "we then convolved various model seds with filter transmission curves and compared the resulting fluxes with those derived from the data . for the dss and css data we assumed standard johnson @xmath62 filters , and",
    "this is clearly a simplification , but the large uncertainties for dss mean that those data have modest weight .",
    "for the wiyn data we used a filter curve from @xcite ; for the _ swift _  data we used a response file from the _ swift _  web site ; the _ galex _  filters were from the cosmos web site . ] .",
    "we used a nominal extinction curve from @xcite and @xcite , with a reddening ratio @xmath63 .",
    "our first model was a reddened blackbody .",
    "we got a good fit , with @xmath64 for 5 degrees of freedom ( and this includes the poorly calibrated dss data ) .",
    "the best - fit model had @xmath65,000k , @xmath66mag , and size @xmath67 at a nominal distance of 2kpc , but a wide range of solutions had similarly good fits ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ) with larger temperature requiring larger extinctions and smaller radii ; as in figure  [ fig : cmd ] this is largely the result of the blackbody model between the @xmath44 and @xmath54 data being parallel to the reddening vector .",
    "the size is largely determined from the wiyn observation , with @xmath68   \\approx   -0.54 - 0.35 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{t_{\\rm eff}}{10 ^ 3\\,{\\rm k}}\\right)\\ ] ] @xmath69 along the best - fit locus .",
    "we then fit model stellar atmospheres from @xcite .",
    "we used models with gravity @xmath70 , although the results were not sensitive to this .",
    "the best - fit model was slightly hotter than the best - fit blackbody ( 21,000k , with @xmath71mag and @xmath72 at a distance of 2kpc ) , and had a slightly worse @xmath31 ( 11.5 ) , but uncertainties in the extinction law below 250 nm @xcite could change the result ; the most discrepant point was the _ galex _  fuv observation .",
    "the best - fit region in the ( @xmath73 ) plane is very similar to that of the blackbody ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "we also tried a 15,000k white dwarf atmosphere model ( a da white dwarf with hydrogen on the surface , which is expected for such a hot star ; @xcite ) , kindly supplied by d.  koester .",
    "the fit was similar to that of a 15,000k main - sequence star since the main differences ( the stronger balmer absorption sequence in the white dwarf ) are not easily distinguished with the available dss @xmath74-band photometry ; the white dwarf model also had trouble fitting the _ galex _  fuv point .",
    "an absorbed power - law spectrum such as that of an active galactic nucleus does not fit ( @xmath75 for 5 degrees of freedom ) . while the spin - down and radio emission of psr  j1816 + 4510  indicate that no accretion disk is likely present ( cf .",
    "* ) , given the unusual nature of the optical / uv emission it may be worth considering whether the high temperature that we measure is from an accretion disk around the pulsar , where ultraviolet emission is common ( although this would tend to also have bright x - ray emission which we do not see , the x - rays could be variable ) .",
    "the sed that we measure is consistent with a single - temperature blackbody , not a multi - temperature model as is usually used to model accretion disks @xcite . therefore , while we can not rule out such a model using photometry alone , we consider it unlikely .",
    "spectroscopy should be definitive .",
    "we note that the faint , diffuse emission seen in the @xmath54-band image could have contaminated some of the lower - resolution data ( in particular _ swift _  and _ galex _ ) .",
    "however , at least at @xmath54-band the brighter spot ( to the south - west ) is about 100 times fainter than the star , so assuming a similar spectrum ( which is conservative for the bluer bands , as the emission is probably either balmer dominated or stellar ) it is unlikely to be important at the @xmath76% level .",
    "we tried subtracting the stellar point - spread - function ( psf ) at the position of the counterpart , but do not see any significant residual emission beyond that visible in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "in the 2.8ks photon - counting observation with x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) 0 counts were detected in a circle with radius @xmath77 around the radio position .",
    "millisecond pulsars typically have a combination of x - rays from thermal ( from hot polar caps ) and non - thermal ( either magnetospheric , or from a shocked pulsar wind ) spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the thermal components have blackbody temperatures with @xmath780.2kev and luminosities of @xmath79 @xcite . for more energetic pulsars the non - thermal components dominate , and these are typically fit as power - laws with photon indices @xmath80 and again luminosities of @xmath79 .",
    "based on a power - law with photon index of 1.5 , we set a 2@xmath51 limit of @xmath81 for the unabsorbed 0.510kev flux from psr  j1816 + 4510  for absorption column densities @xmath82 in the range of @xmath83@xmath84 ( corresponding to @xmath85mag , based on @xcite ) . for a measured spin - down luminosity of @xmath86 (",
    "although see below for possible corrections to this ) , our limit then corresponds to @xmath87 .",
    "we can do the same computation for a thermal spectrum , with unabsorbed flux limits of @xmath88 ( 0.52kev ) for a blackbody with @xmath89kev and @xmath90 .",
    "this then gives a similar limit of @xmath91 .",
    "both of these efficiencies are low but not outside the observed range @xcite , and suggest that the x - ray flux may only be slightly below the _ swift _  limit .",
    "the radio position of psr  j1816 + 4510  matches almost exactly with a source from the _ fermi _  large area telescope second source catalog ( 2fgl ; @xcite ) .",
    "the source ( 1fgl  j1816.7 + 4509 from the first year catalog ) is @xmath92 away from psr  j1816 + 4510 , with a position uncertainty of @xmath93 in radius .",
    "it is listed as having a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , and 0.1100gev flux of @xmath96 .",
    "however , there is another year of data available in the _ fermi _  archive , and we wished to do further spectral analysis and look for pulsations .",
    "therefore we analyzed data from the _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat ; @xcite ) , including events from 2008  august  05 to 2012  january  19 .",
    "we followed standard procedures in filtering events , selecting those with event class 2 within a @xmath97 radius around psr  j1816 + 4510 , with energies between 0.210gev ( to avoid the poor point - spread function at the lowest energies ; the pulsar did not appear to be detected there anyway ) and zenith angles @xmath98 .",
    "we computed the spectrum using an unbinned likelihood analysis , including the contributions of sources out to a radius of @xmath99 from the 2fgl catalog as well as isotropic and galactic background models appropriate for pass 7 data ( models ` iso_p7v6source.txt ` and ` gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits ` ) with the ` p7source_v6 ` instrument response , although we held most of the source parameters fixed at their catalog values with the exceptions of those sources within @xmath100 of psr  j1816 + 4510  and the diffuse background normalizations .",
    "photons are significantly detected between 0.5gev and 5gev . for 2fgl  j1816.5 + 4511",
    "we find a good fit with a power - law model with photon index @xmath101 and normalization @xmath102 at 1.15gev giving an integrated 0.1100gev flux of @xmath103 , with a test statistic of 404 ( i.e. , roughly a @xmath104 detection ) ; this is similar to the result from the 2fgl catalog .",
    "we do not incorporate any systematic uncertainties related to calibration errors .",
    "we repeated the spectral fit with a power - law modified by an exponential cutoff , @xmath105 .",
    "the meager energy range with significant detections meant that the cutoff could not be strongly constrained , but we find @xmath106 , normalization @xmath107 at 0.55gev , and cutoff energy @xmath108gev ; the integrated flux was @xmath109 .",
    "formally this fit was statistically equivalent to the pure power - law fit , and other local minima were also possible depending on where the fit was started .",
    "we note that the parameters we find are outside the range of most millisecond pulsars , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 both higher than are typical .",
    "much of this comes from the highest energies we included in our fit ( 46gev ; fig .",
    "[ fig : fullsed ] ) . without this bin ,",
    "a fit with more typical values ( @xmath80 , @xmath112gev ) is acceptable .",
    "we show the fits in figure  [ fig : fullsed ] , where @xmath1-ray fluxes were determined from modeling the flux in each energy bin as a single power - law using the contributed task ` likesed ` .",
    "we therefore urge caution in interpreting the @xmath1-ray spectrum .    for the pulsation search , after the initial event filtering , we assigned phases to all of the events using the best - fit radio ephemeris using the _ fermi _  plugin for `",
    "tempo2 ` @xcite . we detected pulsations using the initial radio ephemeris , but given the longer time span of the _ fermi _  data compared to the radio data ( 1262days vs.  320days ) we were able to refine the radio ephemeris ( in particular the spin - down ) , as discussed in stovall et al .",
    "we then used the refined ephemeris to update the event phases . selecting the 632 events @xmath113 from the radio position and with energies between 0.3gev and 10gev ( optimizing those parameters for the pulse amplitude , as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we see very significant pulsations , with a @xmath114-test statistic @xcite of 64.4 for 11 harmonics",
    "( false alarm probability of @xmath115 ) . with this solution",
    "we see clear pulsations in the binned light curve with @xmath116 for 19 degrees - of - freedom .",
    "the pulsations have two sharp peaks separated by slightly less than one half of a cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] ) similar to the radio pulse . selecting events from phases 0.320.52 ( where the pulse is at a minimum ) ,",
    "we see a radial profile that is consistent with being flat in terms of counts per unit area out to @xmath117 , with an implied background rate over all phases of @xmath118 ( the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] ) .",
    "this would mean that our lightcurve is consistent with being 100% pulsed .",
    "averaging over pulse phase , the count - rate was roughly constant as a function of orbital phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timephot ] ) , with @xmath119 for 15 degrees - of - freedom . over the two years of the 2fgl catalog the lightcurve was likewise consistent with being constant on month timescales ( @xmath120 for 23 degrees - of - freedom , based on the 2fgl variability index ) .",
    "based on the _ fermi _  flux of @xmath121 ( 0.1100gev ) we find a @xmath1-ray luminosity of @xmath122 .",
    "we determine the @xmath1-ray efficiency by comparing this with @xmath123 and find @xmath124 assuming no geometric beaming correction ; this is comparable with that found for purely magnetospheric emission from millisecond pulsars with _ fermi _",
    "we can set a weak upper limit to the distance by requiring @xmath125 , which gives @xmath126 ( @xmath127kpc ) .",
    "given the highly pulsed @xmath1-ray lightcurve , it is possible that all of the emission could be magnetospheric in origin like for most millisecond pulsars , but some might still be related to intra - binary shocks such as in the system ( * ? ? ?",
    "* which is not a millisecond pulsar but has a hot companion like that seen here ) , especially if there are contributions from inverse compton scattering off the uv photons present in both cases .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fullsed ] we plot the spectral energy distribution from optical to @xmath1-rays .",
    "energetically , the optical / uv are almost as important as the @xmath1-rays , which would make it difficult for them to both ultimately come from @xmath123 ( as the @xmath1-rays already require a substantial fraction of @xmath123 ) , supporting a hot companion which radiates on its own .",
    "changing the extinction to a lower value such as @xmath128mag ( see below ) reduces the total optical luminosity somewhat , but it is still substantial .",
    "the simple power - law fit to the @xmath1-rays exceeds the x - ray upper limit ( much as in @xcite ) , but the cutoff power - law does as well , so with either model we might need a spectral break between 1kev and 100mev .",
    "however , our spectral fitting only had a limited number of counts , and we did not include systematic uncertainties related to instrumental calibration . the apparent discrepancy between the @xmath1-ray emission and the x - ray upper limit may only be a consequence of the spectral fit ; the ratio of @xmath129 between the @xmath1-ray and x - ray luminosities is reasonable for other millisecond pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in what follows",
    ", we primarily assume that the optical / uv emission come from a single photosphere that is the companion of the pulsar in a binary system .",
    "however , without a spectrum we can not exclude contributions from shocked plasma  this might help explain some of the slightly discrepant uv data - points or the somewhat high extinction ( see below ) .    given our extremely likely detection of the optical / uv companion of psr  j1816 + 4510 , and the identification of the pulsar at @xmath1-ray energies , we consider how this system fits among the known recycled pulsars with low - mass companions .",
    "some of the implications of this system are common to a wide range of similar systems , but the uniquely hot temperature may point to either a fortuitous detection of a short - lived evolutionary state or a different evolutionary path .    at the nominal distance , our optical photometry implies @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "if the optical companion filled its roche lobe , it would be at a distance of 10kpc , which is not impossible given the radio and @xmath1-ray properties but is unlikely ( it would require @xmath132 , but this constraint is based on isotropic emission ) . if the optical source is an unrelated object , it would either be a nearby white dwarf at @xmath133pc ( @xcite . ] ; we take it as a @xmath134 carbon / oxygen white dwarf ) or a main sequence star ( b35 ) at a distance of 70100kpc @xcite ; while the former is possible , main sequence stars with @xmath135 would not be expected at such distances .",
    "our best - fit value for the extinction @xmath136 is 0.51.0mag . this is larger than the largest value in this direction ( @xmath137mag ) determined by @xcite , and @xcite",
    "give a similar result .",
    "given the limitations of our fit , values of @xmath138mag are not excluded but would imply effective temperatures of @xmath139,000k ( @xmath128mag increases @xmath31 by 2.2 over the best - fit value for the blackbody fit ) , and we plot the best - fit @xmath128mag blackbody for comparison in figure  [ fig : sed ] . to evaluate the likely extinction , we determined our own run of extinction with distance by examining all of the 2mass stars within @xmath140 and finding the red clump @xcite . while we can not determine the extinction as close as 2kpc ( there are not enough stars ) , we measure extinctions of @xmath141mag for distances @xmath142kpc , which is reasonably consistent with our sed fitting . at this galactic latitude ( @xmath143 )",
    "much of the extinction will be close to the sun , so the value measured at 5kpc should be applicable to closer objects .",
    "we note that our value of @xmath144mag is actually consistent with the measured dm , assuming an ionized fraction of 10% and the usual @xcite conversion between extinction and hydrogen column density , but the hydrogen column density interpolated from maps is lower , @xmath145 .",
    "optical and x - ray spectroscopy can hopefully narrow down the possible range of the extinction . with an minimum eclipse duration of 7% of the orbit at 820mhz ( stovall et al .",
    "2012 ) , the eclipsing radius is @xmath146 .",
    "this is similar to the roche lobe radius , suggesting that some of the eclipsing material may be gravitationally bound to the companion star , although the tail of delayed times - of - arrival ( toas ) extends to larger radii .",
    "the maximum delay observed at 820mhz ( about 400@xmath147s ) implies an excess dispersion measure of @xmath148 , or an electron column density of @xmath149 .",
    "if this material is distributed over @xmath150 , we would have an electron density @xmath151 .",
    "assuming that the material is moving at the escape velocity , we estimate a mass - loss rate of @xmath152 , so the companion would not be substantially diminished over a hubble time ( similar to @xcite ) .",
    "such mass - loss rate is actually comparable with expectations for radiative winds from more massive sdb stars with ( presumably ) similar surface gravities @xcite .",
    "if this and not ablation ( which would only require 0.1% of @xmath123 ) is the origin of the mass loss , then the low gravity and high temperature of the companion seem to be necessary components for the ionized gas eclipses as winds cease for gravities @xmath153 and temperatures @xmath154000k @xcite .",
    "while minor in terms of mass loss the winds might be nonetheless important evolutionarily in altering the diffusive equilibrium @xcite and hence the atmospheric appearance and onset of shell burning .",
    "the measured effective temperature of @xmath5,000k is far hotter than the companion to any known black - widow or redback system ( typically @xmath155k ; @xcite ; breton et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ;",
    "c.  bassa 2011 , pers .",
    "comm . ) by a factor of almost 3 .",
    "pulsars with hot white - dwarf companions are known ( e.g. , 8,550k for , 10,090k for psr  j1911@xmath1565958a , and 15,000k for ; @xcite and references therein ) , but they do not have broad eclipses like those we see here .",
    "we can then address the peculiarity of this system in two ways : ( 1 ) if this is an interacting binary system , what would be the consequences of it being so hot , and ( 2 ) why is it so hot .",
    "for the first question , if we treat psr  j1816 + 4510  as an interacting binary regardless of origin , it is not surprising that we do not see any modulation of the @xmath44-band lightcurve : the additional energy deposited by the pulsar has an equilibrium temperature @xmath157k ( for an efficiency of 100% , while typical efficiencies are closer to 10% ; breton et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) .",
    "note that this ascribes all of the observed spindown @xmath158 to magnetic dipole radiation and not to secular ( i.e. , @xcite ) acceleration ; with a typical millisecond pulsar velocity of @xmath159 the secular @xmath160 would be @xmath161 or 4% of the measured value , so it is likely that the @xmath123 value we use above is close to correct ( corrections due to differential galactic acceleration are even smaller ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the implied temperature is so low compared to the observed temperature , we would expect the illuminated side to be @xmath162 brighter than the dark side ( for an effective temperature of 15,000k ) , which is the level of the observed scatter in the _ swift _  photometry ; if the orbital modulation of the crts data is real , then it is difficult to understand its amplitude .",
    "we note that our sed fitting assumes that the data are constant with time and are defined by only a single model , and these are not necessarily valid assumptions .",
    "even aside from the lack of strong orbital modulation , there could also be secular / state changes such as those seen in @xcite .",
    "however , the limit on secular evolution from the csdr1 data ( which span the times of the _ galex _ , _ swift _ , and wiyn photometry ) suggests that most of the data are consistent with a single model . in the future",
    ", single - epoch photometry should be able to resolve this question .",
    "the nominal radius of the companion is well within the typical range for black - widow / redback companions in the field ( sources in globular clusters often are considerably @xmath163 ; @xcite ) , which may be some clue to the formation mechanism .",
    "however , unlike some of those systems , it is likely a factor of several smaller than the roche lobe , so the companion may not be significantly distorted .",
    "it may be that the @xmath150 eclipse duration is set not by the roche lobe radius but by the intrabinary shock radius between the @xmath123-driven wind and the companion @xcite , where the shock represents the equilibrium between the relativistic wind of the pulsar and the presumed radiation - driven wind from the companion .",
    "assuming an electron density of @xmath164 and pure hydrogen composition at a radius of @xmath165 , the ram pressure @xmath166 is @xmath167 for a wind at the escape velocity , which is a factor of @xmath168 less than @xmath169 ; if this model is valid , then we must consider that the wind might be moving faster than the escape speed @xcite , our density might be too low ( in particular the material might be clumpy ) , or possible only a fraction of @xmath123 participates in the shock @xcite .    for the second question , we can ask why the companion would be so hot .",
    "first , it is possible that psr  j1816 + 4510  has a normal cool companion , but that the optical / uv flux comes from another source .",
    "this could be a star , either as part of a triple system or an unrelated object .",
    "having an unrelated object seems highly unlikely given the positional coincidence , and an association between the radio , @xmath1-ray , and optical sources is the most likely explanation , but without optical modulation to confirm we can not be certain .",
    "a triple system can largely be ruled out by the 3-yr span of the _ fermi _  timing , as those data are consistent with only the 8-hr binary . as mentioned before ,",
    "emission from shocked plasma is also possible .    without knowing the surface gravity ( and hence having some idea of how degenerate the companion is ) , any inferences about why the companion is so hot are difficult . for helium - core white dwarfs in the mass range considered here ( @xmath170 ) burning of a thick shell of hydrogen @xcite can keep the sources hotter for considerably longer ( gyr ; @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) than standard cooling would allow ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the temperatures tend to be @xmath171,000k ; more massive white dwarfs can stay at @xmath172k for longer , and unstable hydrogen flashes can also push the temperature above @xmath173k for more massive white dwarfs temporarily .",
    "we note , though , that the recently discovered binary @xcite has a helium - core white dwarf at a similar temperature to what we find , and this source is somewhat more massive ( @xmath174 ) than the expected burning limit , although the limit is metallicity - dependent and the contribution of tidal heating in this system is unknown . if the companion of psr  j1816 + 4510  were a normal white dwarf we would expect psr  j1816 + 4510  to be on the low side of the possible distances ( radii of @xmath175 are typical at these masses ; @xcite ) with an age of @xmath176gyr . in this scenario ,",
    "psr  j1816 + 4510  would be the first pulsar / white dwarf system with ionized - gas eclipses . however , it could also be that the companion is still hotter and younger still if it has not yet equilibrated from a common - envelope evolutionary phase @xcite or roche - lobe overflow that stripped away the outer layers of the companion , leaving it hot , large , and in a circular orbit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for low - mass ( @xmath177 ) white dwarfs , the residual hydrogen burning typically results in luminosities of @xmath178 @xcite , and therefore it might be that the luminosity we see is dominated by gravitational contraction ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "if that is true , we estimate a thermal timescale of @xmath179myr for an effective temperature of 18,000k and considering the whole star  the timescale would be @xmath179kyr if we only are concerned with a typical envelope of @xmath180 @xcite  so if the companion is larger than a typical low - mass white dwarf then it is likely extremely young , and we might be seeing a newly - born millisecond pulsar slightly after the transitional phase found by @xcite . the hot / large state could also be a result of a recent hydrogen flash .",
    "this source then resembles the rather young wd / sdb stars ( @xmath18121,500k , @xmath182 , @xmath183 ; @xcite ) or ( @xmath18114,900k , @xmath184 , @xmath183 ; @xcite ) which are thought to be progenitors of more typical helium - core white dwarfs .",
    "both of these scenarios ( mass stripping or hydrogen flash ) are possibilities for the hot , bloated white dwarfs seen by _ kepler _",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which the companion to psr  j1816 + 4510  also resembles , although the presence of a neutron star instead of a main sequence primary would require a different evolution .",
    "again , spectroscopy to determine surface gravity and elemental abundances should be definitive . finally , it is possible that , despite the eclipses the system is closer to face - on than edge on , as for inclinations @xmath185 the companion mass is @xmath186 like other hot white dwarf companions .",
    "this would be contrary to the theoretical companion mass vs.  orbital period relation @xcite and would make the radius even stranger , but there is at least one known outlier from the companion mass vs.  orbital period relation with a substantially higher mass than expected @xcite .",
    "the bright counterpart makes optical astrometry within the reach of ground - based telescopes , at least for determining a proper motion .",
    "while we see no definitive proper motion comparing the _ swift _  and wiyn data ( taken 0.6yr apart ) , individual ground - based images can determine the relative position of the pulsar to @xmath187mas in only a few minutes .",
    "we expect a proper motion @xmath188 , so assuming adequate calibration this can be measured in a year or two .",
    "we could then compare this against any radio proper motion determined from timing , which would further establish whether or not the optical source is indeed the companion of the pulsar .",
    "we have discovered the almost certain optical / uv counterpart of the newly - discovered millisecond radio/@xmath1-ray pulsar psr  j1816 + 4510 .",
    "the radio/@xmath1-ray properties of psr  j1816 + 4510  appear much like most energetic eclipsing pulsars discovered recently @xcite , which supports the use of _ fermi _  and low - frequency radio observations to find energetic recycled pulsars .",
    "some aspects of psr  j1816 + 4510 s radio properties appear unique , in that the plausible size of the eclipsing region seems to be contained in its companion s roche lobe , but such inferences depend on the inclination as well as the observing frequency of the radio data .    while we still can not constrain all of its parameters uniquely , the optical / uv properties of psr  j1816 + 4510  appear more robustly unique , with an effective temperature likely at least 3 times higher than any other black - widow or redback system .",
    "in fact , the companion may be the brightest low - mass ( i.e. , not a b star ) optical4715 in the near - infrared @xcite , consistent with its non - detection in 2mass .",
    "] companion to any pulsar @xcite .",
    "this is largely because of the high temperature rather than a small distance or large size .",
    "the high temperature presents a number of puzzles and opportunities . depending on the radius",
    ", it may be that the companion is rather young , and that we are seeing the sources only shortly after its envelope was stripped away .",
    "phase - resolved photometry and spectroscopy will be important to determine the orientation and mass function of the system @xcite , and radio astrometry can help constrain the radius of the companion .",
    "long - term optical monitoring may be able to detect cooling after a recent stripping or burning episode . given how bright it is , modulation of the companion may be detectable from a number of mechanisms .",
    "orbital motion may be visible through doppler boosting @xcite , which is expected to produce modulation of @xmath189% , while ellipsoidal modulations ( @xmath190% ) could help constrain the mass ratio and/or the degree of roche - lobe filling ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at the same time , the high temperature and small size compared to the roche lobe mean that the photocenter may be much closer to the geometric center of the star ( cf .",
