    "in the semi - classical limit chaotic quantum systems very often exhibit universal behavior , in the sense that several of their characteristic quantities agree with the respective quantities found for certain ensembles of random matrices . via trace formulae ,",
    "such quantities can be expressed as suitable sums over the periodic orbits of the underlying classical dynamical system .",
    "for instance , the two - point correlator function is @xmath0 where @xmath1 abbreviates the average over the energy and over a small time window , @xmath2 denotes the heisenberg time and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the amplitude , the action , and the period of the orbit @xmath6 , respectively .    the contribution of the terms @xmath7 to ( [ formfactor ] )",
    "is called the ` diagonal approximation ' and was studied by hannay / ozorio de almeida @xcite and berry @xcite in the 1980 s ; a mathematical rigorous treatment is still missing . also see @xcite for other work on the diagonal approximation .    to next order , as @xmath8 , the main term from ( [ formfactor ] ) arises owing to those orbit pairs @xmath9 for which the action difference @xmath10 is ` small ' .",
    "this was first considered by sieber and richter @xcite , who argued that a given periodic orbit with a self - crossing in configuration space at a small angle @xmath11 ( see figure [ existence ] ) will admit a neighboring periodic orbit with almost the same action .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 was obtained for the action difference .",
    "the neighboring orbit is called a _ partner _ of the given orbit and one calls the two orbits a _ sieber - richter pair_.        in phase space , a sieber - richter pair contains a region where two stretches of the same orbit are almost mutually time - reversed and one addresses this region as a _ @xmath13-encounter _ or , more strictly , a _ @xmath13-antiparallel encounter _ ; the ` 2 ' stands for two orbit stretches which are close in configuration space , and ` antiparallel ' means that the two stretches have opposite directions ; see figure [ existence ] .",
    "the two orbits noticeably differ from each other only by their connections inside the encounter region .",
    "the smaller is the crossing angle , the closer will be the stretches , and the longer the stretches remain close , the smaller will be the resulting action difference . outside the encounter region ,",
    "the two orbits are almost indistinguishable .",
    "in contrast to that , they practically coincide in one loop and appear as time - reversed in the other loop .",
    "this explains why sieber - richter pairs may only exist in systems which are invariant under time - reversal .",
    "taking into account those contributions to ( [ formfactor ] ) , sieber and richter were able to calculate the first two terms in the expansion of ( [ formfactor ] ) for small @xmath14 ( the first term comes from the diagonal approximation ) , and it turned out that the result agreed with what is obtained using random matrix theory @xcite , for certain symmetry classes .",
    "this discovery prompted an increased research activity on the subject matter in the following years and finally led to an expansion @xmath15 for the orthogonal ensemble ( the symmetry class relevant for time - reversal invariant systems ) to all orders in @xmath14 , by including the higher - order encounters also ; see @xcite , and in addition @xcite , which provide much more background and many further references .    to establish a more detailed mathematical understanding ,",
    "it is natural to start , more modestly , on the classical side and try to prove the existence of partner orbits and derive good estimates for the action differences of the partners . for @xmath13-encounters",
    "this is done in the present work , where we consider the geodesic flow on factors of the hyperbolic plane ; in this case the action of a periodic orbit is proportional to its length .",
    "the companion paper @xcite then deals with the technically more involved higher - order encounters .    in the physics community",
    "this system is often called the hadamard - gutzwiller model , and it has frequently been studied @xcite ; further related work includes @xcite . in braun et al .",
    "@xcite symbolic dynamics was used to obtain an approximation for the length difference @xmath16 , where @xmath11 denotes the crossing - angle ; see also @xcite . in both papers",
    "there was no estimate on the error term given . for certain systems ,",
    "including some with two degrees of freedom , turek / richter @xcite and spehner @xcite provided another approximation for the action difference of a sieber - richter pair by introducing suitable coordinates on the poincar section ; also see mller et al .",
    "@xcite for related work . however , these coordinates were not calculated and once again there was no bound given for the error term of the action differences .",
    "this approach was also used for systems with higher degrees of freedom by turek et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ prel_sect ]",
    "we introduce the necessary background material which is well - known in principle @xcite .",
    "since the field requires a substantial amount of notation and identifications , we nevertheless provide some details .",
    "then in section [ srp_sect ] we turn to sieber - richter pairs .",
    "first we give a quantitative version of the shadowing lemma and the anosov closing lemma ; the latter may be of independent interest .",
    "next we consider orbit self - crossings ( in configuration space ) .",
    "theorem [ existthm ] contains a first main result about the existence of a partner orbit and an estimate for the action difference .",
    "if the crossing angle is small enough and the space is compact , then the partner is even unique ; see theorem [ uniq_thm ] .",
    "finally we include a brief discussion of pseudo - orbits , i.e. , of periodic orbits which decompose into smaller pieces .",

    "<S> physicists have argued that periodic orbit bunching leads to universal spectral fluctuations for chaotic quantum systems . to establish a more detailed mathematical understanding of this fact , it is first necessary to look more closely at the classical side of the problem and determine orbit pairs consisting of orbits which have similar actions . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we specialize to the geodesic flow on compact factors of the hyperbolic plane as a classical chaotic system . </S>",
    "<S> we prove the existence of a periodic partner orbit for a given periodic orbit which has a small - angle self - crossing in configuration space which is a ` 2-encounter ' ; such configurations are called ` sieber - richter pairs ' in the physics literature . furthermore , we derive an estimate for the action difference of the partners . in the second part of this paper @xcite , an inductive argument is provided to deal with higher - order encounters . </S>"
