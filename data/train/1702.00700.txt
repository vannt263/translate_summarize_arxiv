    "nowadays , natural language processing ( nlp ) may help professionals to access high quality , structured knowledge extracted from large amounts of unstructured , noisy , and multilingual textual sources @xcite . as the knowledge required usually amounts to reconstructing a chain of previous events ,",
    "building timelines constitutes an efficient and convenient manner of structuring the extracted knowledge .",
    "however , yielding timelines is a high level task that involves information extraction at multiple tiers , including named entities , events or time expressions .",
    "furthermore , it should also be considered that the information required to construct the timeline must be gathered from different parts of a document , or even from different documents .",
    "thus , coreferential mentions of entities and events must be properly identified .",
    "for example , a named entity can be mentioned using a great variety of surface forms ( barack obama , president obama , mr .",
    "obama , obama , etc . ) and the same surface form can refer to a variety of named entities . furthermore , it is possible to refer to a named entity by means of anaphoric pronouns and co - referent nominal expressions such as ` he ' , ` her ' , ` their ' , ` i ' , ` the 35 year old ' , etc . the same applies to event mentions , which can be verbal predicates or verbal nominalizations .",
    "thus , the following two sentences contain different mentions of the same event , namely , that a gas pipe exploded , via the two different predicates ` exploded ' and ` blast ' .",
    "furthermore , while example ( 1 ) allows us to explicitly time - anchor the event via the temporal expression ` yesterday ' , that does not occur in the second example . in this context , building a timeline amounts to detecting and temporal ordering and anchoring the events in which a target named entity participates .",
    "* a leak was the apparent cause of yesterday s gas _ blast _ in central london . * a gas pipe accidentally",
    "_ exploded _ in central london .",
    "only material damage was reported .",
    "temporal relation extraction has been the topic of different semeval tasks @xcite and other challenges as the 6th i2b2 nlp challenge @xcite .",
    "these tasks have focused mainly on the temporal relations of events with respect to other events or time expressions , and their goal is to discover which of them occur before , after or simultaneously with respect to others .",
    "recently , semeval 2015 included a novel task regarding temporal information extraction @xcite .",
    "the aim of semeval 2015 task 4 was to order in a timeline the events in which a target entity is involved .",
    "the task presents some significant differences with respect to previous evaluation settings .",
    "first , temporal information must be recovered from different sources across documents .",
    "second , timelines are focused on the events pertaining just to a single given target entity . finally , unlike previous challenges , semeval 2015 task 4 requires a complete time anchoring .    in this work",
    "we build on the semeval 2015 timeline extraction task to present a system and framework to perform multilingual and cross - lingual timeline extraction .",
    "this is based on the assumption that timelines and events can be recovered from a variety of data sources across documents and across languages . in doing so",
    ", this paper presents a number of novel contributions .",
    "[ [ contributions ] ] contributions + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the original cross - document event ordering task defined for semeval 2015 ( main track a ) is extended to present two novel tasks for two languages ( english and spanish ) on multilingual and cross - lingual timeline extraction , respectively .",
    "the tasks also generated publicly available annotated datasets for trial and evaluation .",
    "additionally , two new evaluation metrics improve the evaluation methodology of the semeval 2015 task to address both the multilingual and cross - lingual settings .",
    "interestingly , we also show that the temporal relations that explicitly connect events and time expressions are not enough to obtain a full time - anchoring annotation and , consequently , produce incomplete timelines .",
    "we propose that for a complete time - anchoring the temporal analysis must be performed at a document level in order to discover implicit temporal relations .",
    "furthermore , we show how to effectively leverage multilingual resources such as the predicatematrix @xcite and dbpedia to improve the performance in a more realistic setting of building cross - lingual timelines when no parallel data as input is available .",
    "we present a deterministic approach that obtains , by far , the best results on the main track a of semeval 2015 task 4 .",
    "our deterministic approach is fledged out via three different timeline extraction systems which extend an initial version presented in @xcite .",
    "to guarantee reproducibility of results we also make publicly available the systems , datasets and scripts used to perform the evaluations .",
    "next section reviews related work , focusing on the semeval 2015 timeline extraction task .",
    "next , section [ sec : mult - crossl - timel ] describes the two new cross - lingual and multilingual timeline extraction tasks .",
    "the construction of the datasets for the new tasks occupies section [ sec : annotation ] and section [ sec : scorer ] formulates the evaluation methodology employed in this work . in section [ sec :",
    "evaluation ] we report the evaluation results obtained by the systems previously presented in section [ sec : system ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : error ] provides an error analysis to discuss the results and contributions of our approach while section [ sec : concluding - remarks ] highlights the main aspects of our work and future directions .",
    "the present work is directly related to the semeval 2015 task 4 , timeline : cross - document event ordering @xcite . its aim is to combine temporal processing and event coreference resolution to extract from a collection of documents a set of timelines of events pertaining to a specific target entity .",
    "the notion of event is based on the timeml definition , namely , an event is considered to be a term that describes a situation or a state or circumstance that can be held as true @xcite .",
    "in fact , the timeline extraction task is in turn quite close to the tempeval campaigns @xcite .",
    "briefly , the problem is formulated as a classification task to decide the type of temporal link that connects two different events or an event and a temporal expression .",
    "for that reason , the task has been mainly addressed using supervised techniques .",
    "for example , @xcite trained a maxent classifier using training data which was bootstrapped by applying temporal closure .",
    "@xcite focused on event - event relations using previously learned event attributes .",
    "more recently , @xcite combined hand - coded rules with some semantic and discourse features . @xcite obtained the best results in tempeval 2013 annotating sentences with predicate - role structures , while @xcite state that using a simple feature set results in better performances .",
    "other recent works such as @xcite have pointed out that these tasks cover just a part of all the temporal relations that can be inferred from the documents .",
    "the semeval 2015 timeline extraction task proposed two tracks , depending on the type of data used as input .",
    "the main track a for which only raw text sources were provided , and track b , where gold event mentions were also annotated . for each of the two tracks a sub - track",
    "was also proposed in which the assignment of time anchoring was not taken into account for the evaluation .",
    "no training data was provided for any of the tracks .",
    "track a received three runs from two participants : the whunlp and spinozavu teams .",
    "both approaches were based on applying a pipeline of linguistic processors including named entity recognition , event and nominal coreference resolution , named entity disambiguation , and temporal processing @xcite .",
    "the spinozavu system was further developed in @xcite .",
    "the track b approaches , represented by the two participants heideltoul and gplsiua , substantially differ from those of track a because the event mentions pertaining to the target entity are already provided as gold annotations .",
    "therefore , those systems focused on event coreference resolution and temporal processing @xcite .",
    "two recent works have been recently published on track b : an extension of the gplsiua system @xcite , and a distant supervision approach using joint inference @xcite .",
    "track a is , in our opinion , the most realistic scenario as systems are provided a collection of raw text documents and their task is to extract the timeline of events for each of the target entities . more specifically , the input provided is a set of documents and a set of target entities ( organization , people , product or financial entity ) while the output should consist of one timeline ( events , time anchors and event order ) for each target entity .",
    "compared to previous works on track a of the semeval 2015 timeline extraction task , our approach differs in several important ways .",
    "firstly , it addresses the extraction of implicit information to provide a better time - anchoring @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we are inspired by recent works on implicit semantic role labelling ( isrl ) @xcite and , specially , on @xcite who adapted isrl to focus on modifiers , including temporal arguments , instead of core arguments or roles . given",
    "that not training data is provided , we developed a deterministic algorithm for timeline extraction loosely inspired by @xcite .",
    "secondly , we extend the monolingual approach to make it multi- and cross - lingual , which constitutes a novel system on its own .",
    "finally , our approach outperforms every other previous approach on the task , almost doubling the score of the next best system .",
    "the timeline extraction definition was formulated as follows : `` given a set of documents and a target entity , the task is to build an event timeline related to that entity , i.e. to detect , anchor in time and order the events involving the target entity '' @xcite . as we have already mentioned in the previous section , in this work we will focus on track a ( main track ) , which is the most demanding and realistic setting of the two : systems are given a set of raw text documents and the task is to extract the timelines . furthermore , we contribute two novel extensions to the original task :    * * multilingual timeline extraction * : this task straightforwardly extends the semeval 2015 task to cover new languages .",
    "thus , a parallel set of documents and a set of target entities , common to all languages , are provided .",
    "the goal is to obtain a timeline for each target entity in each language independently . * * cross - lingual timeline extraction * : for this task , the timelines are built from source data in different languages identifying those event mentions that are coreferent across languages .",
    "however , unlike in the multilingual setting , every document in every language is considered together so that _ a single cross - lingual timeline _ is expected for each of the target entities .",
    "these two new tasks are presented here for two languages , namely , english and spanish .",
    "figure [ fig : timeline ] shows an example of both multilingual and cross - lingual timelines for the target entity _ boeing_. the left - hand side column corresponds to an english timeline extracted from four sentences in two different english documents . on the right - hand side is shown an spanish timeline obtained from two sentences contained in two different documents .",
    "words in bold refer to the event mentions that compose the timeline .",
    "finally , the box in the bottom depicts a cross - lingual timeline built from sources in both english and spanish .",
    "coreferent events across languages , such as _ unveils _ and _ revelado _ , are annotated in the same row , while events that are simultaneous but are no coreferent appear in different rows .",
    "the events _ relationship _ and _ acuerdo _ ( in the last two rows ) provide such an example .",
    "the following section describes in more detail the procedure used to build the datasets for both the multilingual and cross - lingual timeline extraction tasks .",
    "in the original timeline extraction task at semeval 2015 @xcite , the dataset was extracted from the raw text of the english side of the meantime corpus @xcite . given",
    "that meantime is a parallel corpus that includes manual translations from english to spanish , italian and dutch , it is straightforward to use its spanish part for the multilingual and cross - lingual timeline extraction tasks .      in order to better understand the procedure to create the datasets for the multilingual and cross - lingual settings , a brief overview of the original annotation to create the",
    "gold standard timelines for english is provided . for full details of the original annotation",
    ", please check the semeval 2015 task description @xcite . as already mentioned , the input to the task consisted of the target entities , the event mentions and the time anchors . in the following ,",
    "each of these three aspects are described .",
    "[ [ target - entities ] ] target entities + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a set of target entities were selected that belong to type person ( _ e.g .",
    "steve jobs _ ) , organisation ( _ e.g . apple inc .",
    "_ ) , product ( _ e.g .",
    "airbus a380 _ ) , and financial ( _ e.g .",
    "nasdaq _ ) .",
    "the target entities must appear in at least two different documents and be involved in more than two events .",
    "[ [ events ] ] events + + + + + +    the annotation of events was restricted by limiting the annotation to events that could be placed on a timeline .",
    "adjectival events , cognitive events , counter - factual events , uncertain events and grammatical events were not annotated .",
    "furthermore , timelines only contain events in which target entities explicitly participate as _ agent _ or _",
    "patient_.    [ [ time - anchors ] ] time anchors + + + + + + + + + + + +    a time anchor corresponds to a timex3 of type date @xcite .",
    "its format follows the iso-8601 standard : yyyy - mm - dd ( i.e. year , month , and day ) .",
    "the finest granularity for time anchor values is day ; other granularities admitted are month and year ( references to months are specified as yyyy - mm and references to years are expressed as yyyy ) .",
    "[ [ creation - of - multilingual - timelines ] ] creation of multilingual timelines + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the process described above was followed to create timelines in spanish . in both cases ,",
    "english and spanish , timelines are represented in tabulated format .",
    "each row contains one event representing an instance of an event occurring at a specific time .",
    "the first column of each row indicates the position of the event in the timeline .",
    "the second column specifies the time - anchor of the event .",
    "additional columns in the row , if any , refer to the different mentions of that event in the dataset .",
    "each event mention is identified with the document identifier , the sentence number and the textual extent of the mention .",
    "the document identifier is in turn composed of a prefix specifying the language in which the document is written and its numerical identifier .",
    "if two events have the same time - anchor but they are not coreferent , they are placed on different rows .",
    "an example of multilingual annotations for english and spanish is provided by figure [ fig : timeline ] .",
    "[ [ creation - of - cross - lingual - timelines ] ] creation of cross - lingual timelines + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we automatically cross the annotations from the english and spanish parallel corpora .",
    "the resulting timelines have the same format as the original ones .",
    "more specifically , when two mentions of the same event in two different languages refer to the same event then they are included in the same row .",
    "the automatic mapping of annotations to construct the cross - lingual timelines was manually revised .",
    "a brief example of a cross - lingual dataset is illustrated by the box at the bottom of figure [ fig : timeline ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "in this work we present a system to perform multilingual and cross - lingual timeline extraction ( or cross - document event ordering ) . in doing so",
    ", this paper presents a number of novel contributions .",
    "firstly , the original cross - document event ordering task defined for semeval 2015 ( main track a ) has been extended to present two novel tasks for two languages ( english and spanish ) on multilingual and cross - lingual timeline extraction respectively .",
    "the annotated datasets for trial and evaluation are publicly available .",
    "secondly , two new evaluation metrics improve the evaluation methodology of the semeval 2015 task in two ways : ( i ) a new _ strict _ metric allows to evaluate timelines containing coreferent event mentions across both documents and languages ; and ( ii ) a _ relaxed _ evaluation metric where event types ( instead of mentions ) can be considered , somewhat diminishing the importance of recall when evaluating the timelines .",
    "thirdly , three deterministic timeline extraction systems have been developed to address the three tasks .",
    "in fact , we have empirically demonstrated that addressing implicit time - anchors at document level ( dlt system ) crucially improves the performance in the three tasks , clearly outperforming previously presented systems in the ( main ) track a of the original timeline extraction task at semeval 2015 .",
    "furthermore , we have shown how to effectively use cross - lingual resources such as the predicatematrix and dbpedia along with time normalization to improve the performance of the dlt system in the most realistic setting of building cross - lingual timelines without parallel data as input ( see figure [ fig : results50 ] ) .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the cascading errors produced by the nlp pipeline used to identify the entities , events and time - anchors .",
    "the results allow to conclude that the most difficult obstacles reside in detecting and resolving every mention of entities related to the relevant mention events and the identification of time - anchors when they are not explicitly conveyed .",
    "these two aspects shall point out future work towards improving timeline extraction .",
