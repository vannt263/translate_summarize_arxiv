    "the general boundary formulation ( gbf ) of quantum field theory ( qft ) , developed extensively in @xcite , is an axiomatic framework for qft that allows one to formulate quantum field theory on general spacetime regions with general boundaries .",
    "it was originally inspired by , and can be seen as a geometric version of , topological quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the set of axioms assigns algebraic structures to geometrical structures and ensures the consistency of these assignments .    like atiyahs axiomatization of tqfts , which captures the consistency conditions required for a background independent quantum field theory to be sensible",
    ", gbf captures the consistency conditions for a quantum field theory on a background metric , but without presuming a 3 + 1 split , or asymptotic states .",
    "the central subject of the axioms are state spaces associated to boundaries of space time regions and amplitudes for the processes inside them .",
    "the question of how states evolve from a cauchy surface is replaced by the question of whether a state on an arbitrary boundary is extensible ( not necessarily uniquely ) throughout a space time region .",
    "the gbf amplitudes are a generalization of the standard notion of transition amplitude . as in the standard formulation ,",
    "probabilities for physical processes can be derived from this amplitude , generalizing the born rule @xcite .",
    "using the gbf in principle allows the investigation of quantum field theories on compact spacetime regions as well as on regions with purely timelike boundaries .",
    "the latter are the subject of this article .",
    "we would like to emphasize that neither compact spacetime regions nor those with timelike boundaries can be treated in the standard formulation of qft .",
    "state spaces and amplitudes for the gbf can be constructed rigorously in different ways , in analogy to different quantization methods developed for ordinary qft , leading to different representations of the quantum theory .",
    "the first construction given in the literature follows a path integral picture and leads to the so - called schrdinger - feynman representation .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite .",
    "another quantization based on geometric and holomorphic quantization for scalar fields leads to the holomorphic representation .",
    "this is the representation we will use throughout this paper .",
    "it was established for linear field theories in @xcite and affine field theories in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", oeckl showed that there is a one - to - one relation between the two representations , and thus the decision to use one or the other depends only on their respective technical advantages for particular applications .",
    "furthermore , three different quantization prescriptions for observables in the gbf have been explored so far : one is the feynman quantization prescription which is a mathematical rigorous version of the path integral quantization of observables @xcite , the second is the berezin - toeplitz quantization prescription and the third is the normal ordering prescription @xcite . among them , the feynman quantization prescription is preferred as it is used in standard quantum field theory , leading to results that agree with experimental observations .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the other quantization prescriptions , the feynman quantization prescription fulfills natural identities when several spacetime regions are combined @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study in detail physical conditions one can impose to determine the remaining ambiguities in the quantization , that is , the choice of vacuum state , or in the language of holomorphic quantization , the complex structure .",
    "this condition is based on coupling an unruh - dewitt detector moving along a specified world line in minkowski space and studying the transition rates given certain boundary states .",
    "we find that , if a notion of outgoing and ingoing modes is specified in advance , the condition that a detector at rest does not click for outgoing modes can fix the complex structure for the ordinary field modes , i.e. propagating waves .    for field modes that behave exponentially in space , i.e. evanescent waves",
    ", it is less clear how to select the states for the no - click condition .",
    "thus we also study the actual transition rates in a concrete experimental set up capable of producing modes that are exponentially decaying in space @xcite .",
    "this is done by putting a dielectric boundary outside of the timelike region we consider .",
    "we find that we can reproduce the result for the response of the detector derived from canonical quantization in the gbf only if we take the physics outside the spacetime region into account .",
    "then , the corresponding complex structure agrees with the one obtained from asymptotic consideration . this can be seen as a gbf manifestation of the non - locality of the vacuum state .      to introduce the reader to the general boundary formulation of quantum theory",
    "we consider the quantum harmonic oscillator formulated in the language of the gbf in the following section",
    ". then we consider holomorphic boundary states and amplitudes .",
    "we call this the boundary formulation of the quantum harmonic oscillator skipping the word  general  since in the corresponding set up there is only one possible choice of boundary",
    ".    we then briefly review the case of a scalar general boundary quantum field theory in section [ sec - quant - complexstruct ] in the holomorphic quantization scheme , discussing in particular the notion of unitarity in the theory , and the construction of one - particle - states and the one point function .",
    "the latter allows us to give the gbf formulation of the unruh - dewitt detector by using the text book formulas for the detector coupling .",
    "an independent derivation that happens fully in the gbf framework is given in appendix [ sec : detector ] , using coherent states which are reviewed in appendix [ sec - costat ] .",
    "in section [ sec : noclick ] , we show that , using symmetry arguments and an appropriate choice of boundary states , we can determine the complex structure for propagating modes by requiring a detector at rest to not click . in section [ sec : experimsituation ] , we then consider an actual physical example in which evanescent waves appear as the appropriate choice of boundary state is unclear for evanescent waves using the general boundary formulation .",
    "this example is a toy model of a free electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric boundary .",
    "the excitation rates induced by evanescent waves in this case have been studied theoretically and experimentally in @xcite .",
    "we show that in order to reproduce the transition rates while maintaining the ability to model the two situations of particle emission and particle absorption as orthogonal subsets in the boundary hilbert space , which is the situation one has in canonical quantization , the complex structure has to depend on the physical situation at the dielectric boundary , even if this boundary is outside of the spacetime region considered .",
    "we conclude that a complex structure for evanescent waves can not be chosen by general physical arguments pertaining only to the spacetime region under consideration .",
    "we further show that the correct result for the transition rate of the detector is reproduced if a particular non - unitary complex structure is considered that reproduces the right asymptotic behavior .",
    "such a non - unitary complex structure is used for the first time in interacting gbqft in this article .",
    "in order to introduce the ideas underlying the general boundary formalism as well as those of holomorphic quantization we will begin by discussing these ideas using the harmonic oscillator as a concrete example for a system with one degree of freedom . here we interpret the harmonic oscillator as a 0-dimensional quantum field theory , that is , a quantum system on a world line .",
    "the boundaries of a segment of a world line are simply its start point , at parameter @xmath0 and end point at parameter @xmath1 . in the following section we will then introduce the more general constructions used for the scalar field .",
    "the harmonic oscillator itself will also reappear as an unruh - dewitt type detector in section [ sec : detector ] .",
    "while the standard formulation of quantum mechanics is concerned with the evolution of a system in the hilbert space as it changes through time @xmath2 , the general boundary formulation of quantum mechanics considers amplitudes between initial and final states . for 0-dimensional systems",
    "this is not more general , merely a rewriting that suggests an obvious generalization for the higher dimensional case .    to make this concrete for the 0-dimensional case we introduce a copy of the hilbert space of the harmonic oscillator at each time",
    "these spaces are all canonically identified with the space at some fiducial time @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "we have the standard unitary evolution from @xmath5 to @xmath6 given by @xmath7 .",
    "the usual statements we want to make in the theory concern probabilities to observe the system in a subspace @xmath8 given that it was prepared in a subspace @xmath9 .",
    "we will denote the projectors on the subspace @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "we introduce an orthonormal basis of @xmath10 as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we model this situation in the text book way by taking the system at time @xmath0 to be given by the density matrix @xmath14 , then at time @xmath1 it will be in the state @xmath15 the text book probability to observe the proposition @xmath16 is then given by @xmath17 or more explicitly    @xmath18",
    "the general boundary formalism takes this as its starting point .",
    "we take the boundary hilbert space @xmath19 of a segment @xmath20 $ ] to be the space @xmath21 , where @xmath22 indicates the hermitian dual .",
    "then @xmath23 is the subspace of events we are interested in , relative to the preparation subspace @xmath24 , which only encodes the information on how the system was prepared .",
    "note that here we have @xmath25 .",
    "we want to express the above formula given the spaces @xmath26 and @xmath27 directly . to do so it is convenient to consider the unitary evolution @xmath28 as a map from the boundary space to @xmath29 , that is , we introduce @xmath30 as the linear map defined by    @xmath31    @xmath32 is simply @xmath33 seen as an element of @xmath34 .",
    "the map @xmath32 can then also be read as the inner product in @xmath19 , of the normalized state @xmath35 with the state @xmath36 .",
    "that is ,    @xmath37    viewed this way the norm square of the map @xmath32 can be seen as the length of the projection of @xmath38 on the subspace spanned by @xmath39 , that is , writing the projector onto that subspace @xmath40 we have that @xmath41    this allows for an immediate generalization to arbitrary subspaces @xmath42 .",
    "given a projector @xmath43 onto @xmath42 and an arbitrary orthonormal basis @xmath44 of @xmath42 , the amplitude can thus be written as @xmath45    it is then straightforward to see that equation can be written as    @xmath46    the central assumption of the general boundary formalism is that the above formula remains valid for wide classes of boundaries , subspaces and amplitude maps @xmath32 in higher dimensions .      for the harmonic oscillator with classical variables @xmath47 , @xmath48 we have the usual hilbert space @xmath49 .",
    "we write @xmath50 .",
    "the usual operators are @xmath51 and , using the shorthand @xmath52 @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and the evolution map @xmath55 .",
    "from this we immediately have the general boundary construction above with @xmath56      for us it will be interesting to see an alternative construction of the general boundary formulation ingredients though , given by holomorphic quantization .",
    "this can be seen as a special case of geometric quantization @xcite and was introduced for affine and linear general boundary field theory in @xcite .    in the usual description of the harmonic oscillator",
    "above , we represent the algebra of observables by acting on the space of functions on just one of the canonical variables , @xmath47 .",
    "these can be seen as functions on phase space satisfying @xmath57 .",
    "we can instead work with a different set of functions on phase space that instead satisfy @xmath58 . introducing @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and the variable @xmath61 ,",
    "these are exactly the holomorphic functions of @xmath62 .",
    "these are the functions that satisfy @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the wirtinger derivative @xmath65 .",
    "this space of holomorphic functions on the complex line , @xmath66 with inner product @xmath67 is particularly well suited for the harmonic oscillator and the bosonic scalar field .    the representation of the algebra of observables is easily given in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "on vectors @xmath70 these are defined simply as multiplication and derivative operators respectively ,    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is again a wirtinger derivative @xmath73 .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath69 and @xmath68 satisfy the commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators . to check whether this is indeed a representation , we need to check that the hermitian dual of @xmath69 with respect to the gaussian inner product above is indeed @xmath68 , which follows from partial integration , and the fact that the wirtinger derivative of the antiholomorphic function @xmath74 vanishes .",
    "we can now also see how the holomorphic picture is well suited to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the constant function @xmath75 is annihilated by @xmath69 and thus gives the ground state .",
    "general states generated by @xmath68 and @xmath69 are simply polynomials of @xmath62 .",
    "coherent states take the simple form , @xmath76 they are of particular interest because they fulfill the reproducing kernel property @xmath77 this can be seen by expressing @xmath78 in a taylor series , expressing the powers of @xmath62 with powers of the creation operator @xmath79 and the vacuum state , using the duality of @xmath80 and @xmath79 , shifting the integration variable @xmath62 to @xmath81 and using that @xmath82 .",
    "the space of holomorphic functions on phase space that is used depends on the choice of complex structure on phase space which provides an identification of phase space with the complex numbers .",
    "different complex structures will lead to different function spaces .",
    "this ambiguity is of no big consequence in finite systems .",
    "the stone - von neumann theorem ensures that all representations of the canonical commutation relations are unitarily equivalent , even though this might not be obvious in practice .",
    "this will change in the case of the scalar field that we will consider later in this paper , where the choice of complex structure can be shown to correspond to a choice of vacuum state .",
    "for this reason we will here discuss several different ways in which this choice of complex structure can be encoded .",
    "the classical data which we have to start with is @xmath83 , the phase space of our system , parametrized by canonically conjugate coordinates @xmath48,@xmath47 , and equipped with an antisymmetric bilinear form @xmath84 , the poisson bracket .",
    "we call the complexification of this phase space , @xmath85 .",
    "the identification with the complex numbers can be encoded by specifying how the multiplication with the imaginary unit acts on phase space .",
    "that is , if @xmath86 is the real - linear map from @xmath29 to @xmath83 , we are interested in the operator @xmath87 defined by    @xmath88    this operator is called a complex structure and has the property the @xmath89 .",
    "thus it has eigenvalues @xmath90 .",
    "we can diagonalize it by lifting it to the complexified phase space @xmath85 .",
    "its eigenspaces @xmath91 are complex linear subspaces of @xmath85 of complex dimension one , as @xmath92 .",
    "the projection on its @xmath93 eigenspace @xmath94 , @xmath95 provides us with an immediate identification of the real subspace @xmath83 and @xmath96 .",
    "its inverse is always just given by @xmath97 .",
    "thus a complex structure does indeed provide us with an identification of phase space with @xmath29 , as claimed .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : projection ] .",
    "from @xmath94 to the real subspace @xmath98 . ]",
    "if the complex structure satisfies @xmath99 , and the symmetric linear form @xmath100 is positive , we call @xmath87 compatible with @xmath84 .",
    "the triple @xmath101 is called a khler structure on phase space .",
    "we will always require that @xmath84 and @xmath87 define such a khler structure .",
    "this ensures that the inner product on @xmath102 , defined in terms of @xmath103 and @xmath84 as @xmath104 , is hermitian .",
    "a more thorough and precise introduction to these structures in the general case will be given in section [ sec - quant - complexstruct ] .",
    "we will now continue looking at the example of the holomorphic harmonic oscillator from section [ sec : harmosci1 ] and write down the above structures in this case .",
    "we have @xmath105 so , introducing the shorthand notation @xmath106 , the map @xmath86 from @xmath83 to @xmath29 is explicitly given by @xmath107 .",
    "then @xmath87 is the matrix    @xmath108    the standard symplectic structure inherited by the dynamics is in these coordinates    @xmath109    it is straightforward to see that @xmath110 , and that the bilinear form @xmath111 is positive and symmetric and thus defines a natural metric on phase space .",
    "thus @xmath112 and @xmath103 form a khler structure as required .",
    "as noted above they define a complex inner product @xmath113 via    @xmath114    this complex inner product is sesquilinear in the sense that @xmath115 . in this case",
    "it is    @xmath116    the familiar sesquilinear form on @xmath29 .",
    "the eigenspaces of @xmath87 in @xmath117 are given by    @xmath118    more generally , the most general linear map on @xmath83 which satisfies @xmath119 can be written as @xmath120 it can be shown that @xmath87 and @xmath84 are compatible , or equivalently that @xmath121 is symmetric , and that @xmath103 is positive , iff we have @xmath122 .",
    "the choice we made at the beginning of this section corresponds to @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the eigenspace @xmath94 for the complex structure ( [ j_gen ] ) can be written as @xmath125 where @xmath126 , in other words @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "different complex structures lead to different identifications of phase space with the complex numbers . thus the spaces of holomorphic functions for different complex structures , when viewed as functions on phase space , differ .",
    "however , it is still possible to compare functions in theses different function spaces , by considering them as square integrable functions on phase space and taking an inner product there .",
    "this inner product is called a pairing @xcite .",
    "concretely , given two different identifications , @xmath128 , and states @xmath78 , @xmath129 in @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively , we can construct functions @xmath132 , and @xmath133 that are square integrable on phase space .",
    "that is , @xmath134 .",
    "is given by the symplectic form .",
    "]    we denote the pairing between @xmath39 and @xmath135 by @xmath136 .",
    "explicitly it is given by    @xmath137    this pairing has different physical interpretations that need to be established on a case by case basis .",
    "note that as any classical time evolution @xmath138 generated by a hamiltonian vector field leaves the symplectic form @xmath84 invariant , the operator @xmath139 is also a compatible complex structure . in this case",
    "the classical time evolution operator @xmath138 , considered as a map between the complex spaces arising from @xmath87 and @xmath140 , is unitary . as the hermitian inner product on these complex spaces",
    "is defined in terms of @xmath84 and @xmath87 , this will always be the case if we have @xmath141 .    remarkably , for the harmonic oscillator the pairing between the holomorphic hilbert spaces at different times",
    "provides us with the full quantum dynamics . to see this",
    "we can view phase space as the space of solutions @xmath142 to the equations of motion ,    @xmath143    with @xmath144 given in terms of our previous phase space coordinates .",
    "we then have an entire family of phase space coordinates , @xmath145 and @xmath146 provides a whole family of complex structures on phase space .",
    "note that the operators @xmath87 can be written in very compact form as    @xmath147    expressing this operator in the various coordinates @xmath148 and @xmath149 provides the complex structures @xmath150 .",
    "these complex structures are related quite simply by @xmath151 .",
    "as anticipated it is a unitary transformation .",
    "the pairing is now of the form    @xmath152    which , noting that @xmath153 are real and thus equal to @xmath154 , we can simplify to    @xmath155    we can now check that we actually have    @xmath156    where @xmath157 is the inner product in @xmath158 , with @xmath159 .",
    "thus , remarkably , the pairing between the hilbert spaces associated to the different complex structures is related by the classical time translation and provides us with the full quantum dynamics .",
    "in general the pairing can be identified with semi - classical transition amplitudes .",
    "it is only for the harmonic oscillator and linear field theory , where it provides us with the bogoliubov transformation , that the pairing provides the full quantum mechanical amplitudes .",
    "the pairing can be evaluated very simply on coherent states , using the reproducing kernel property in equation ( [ eq : harmoscrepkern ] ) and the unitarity relation in equation ( [ eq : harmoscunitary ] ) to obtain @xmath160    this ability to solve the dynamics in a straightforward way which makes the dependence on the underlying choices of complex structure obvious will also be true for the case of the field theory .",
    "this is what motivates our use of holomorphic quantization .",
    "note that the operator ordering in the quantum hamiltonian is not the standard one for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "it differs by the ground state energy of @xmath161 .",
    "this is the standard ordering for the free field theory , and the discrepancy for the harmonic oscillator will not matter for our application .",
    "the correct ordering can be obtained at the cost of significant technical complications , and we refer the interested reader to the literature , in particular the book @xcite , on this point .      with the help of the pairing we can now give a very simple prescription for constructing the holomorphic general boundary harmonic oscillator for an interval @xmath20 $ ] from the classical data .",
    "the space of solutions for the harmonic oscillator is parametrized by the position and momentum at a certain time @xmath2 , which , without adding any extra structure , we call @xmath162 . given two copies of this phase space , one given by the parametrization @xmath163 at time @xmath0 and one by the parametrization @xmath164 at time @xmath1 we can form the direct sum of these spaces @xmath165 to obtain the boundary phase space .",
    "the physical phase space @xmath166 is then simply a 2-dimensional subspace of this boundary phase space with elements @xmath167 such that @xmath168 parametrizes the same solution as @xmath169 .",
    "we can now directly quantize this setup using holomorphic quantization to obtain the general boundary formulation of the harmonic oscillator in this language .",
    "we put a complex structure on @xmath170 , take the time translation related one at @xmath171 , identify them with @xmath29 and use the holomorphic hilbert space construction to define the boundary hilbert space for the region @xmath20 $ ] , that is , @xmath172 with @xmath173 .",
    "we then use the pairing to define an amplitude map @xmath32    @xmath174    where @xmath154 .",
    "the structure we considered above was for the @xmath175-dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "the prescription of general boundary field theory for higher dimensions is to consider as classical boundary spaces , the space of solutions in the neighborhood of the boundary .",
    "the question of dynamics is then coded in the question if a particular solution near the boundary can be extended to the bulk .",
    "this immediately generalizes our discussion above , as our boundary consists of two parts , which each individually corresponds to solutions near the boundary that are extensible throughout time .",
    "thus the question of dynamics is simply if the extension from both parts of the boundary defines the same solution .",
    "this is another way to describe the subspace @xmath176 given above .",
    "in what follows we will always have a boundary with two components .",
    "we will always take the space of classical solutions near each of these components to be the space of solutions near them that can be extended throughout space time , that is , phase space .",
    "thus the space of solutions near the entire boundary is the direct sum of two copies of phase space .    to then move on to construct a quantum theory based on this classical data we will need to again specify complex structures and construct hilbert spaces on the spaces @xmath83 .",
    "we will now do so for the special case of the klein - gordon field .",
    "in this section we give the analogues structures to the holomorphic boundary formulation of the harmonic oscillator for the klein - gordon field , and give the unruh - dewitt detector coupling in this formulation .",
    "the key new element is the ambiguity in the choice of khler manifolds and khler polarizations .",
    "the holomorphic quantization scheme for this case was given in detail in @xcite for linear and affine field theories .",
    "it is a special case of geometric quantization that can be found in detail in @xcite . in section [ sec : ladder ]",
    "we give the one particle sector and the one point function . in [ sec : timeev ] we will define the general notion of unitarity we already found for the harmonic oscillator above . in section [ sec : symmred ] , we will show how to impose spacetime symmetries on the complex structure , this is what usually singles out a preferred complex structure / vacuum state in minkowski space , and leads to reduction of the problem of defining the complex structure to energy eigenspaces in our case . finally in section",
    "[ sec : udw ] we give the unruh - dewitt detector response rates .",
    "holomorphic general boundary quantization in general spacetime regions with general boundaries is a difficult , and unsolved mathematical problem . in order to make it tractable for us",
    ", we will always make the following assumptions throughout the rest of the paper :    1 .",
    "we consider piecewise flat spacetimes @xmath177 which are differentiable manifolds of dimension 2 and 4 equipped with a lorentzian metric @xmath103 with signature @xmath178 and @xmath179 respectively .",
    "regions @xmath180 are assumed to be orientable submanifolds with a two - component and flat boundary @xmath181 with orientation inherited from @xmath182 and such that @xmath183 .",
    "we choose the unit normal vector field @xmath184 on @xmath185 to be outward pointing .",
    "@xmath185 is either everywhere spacelike or everywhere timelike .",
    "thus in particular @xmath186 and @xmath187 are parallel . 3 .",
    "we only consider solutions to the field equations which have the following global extension property : if a solution is specified in a neighbourhood of @xmath188 , it can be uniquely extended to all of @xmath182 .",
    "in particular , in section 4 we will consider a two - dimensional minkowski strip for explicit calculations .      to give the klein - gordon fuel in the holomorphic gbf",
    "we need to classical phase space structure first . for any region @xmath189",
    "we have the action integral    @xmath190    where @xmath191 is the usual lagrangian density for the klein - gordon field on a lorentzian spacetime @xmath192    as noted before , the gbf uses the real vector space @xmath193 of solutions to the euler - lagrange - equations in a neighborhood of @xmath185 .",
    "the dynamics can than be phrased as the problem of extending the solutions from a neighborhood of @xmath185 to @xmath182 .",
    "the symplectic form can be derived from the action and is given by    @xmath194    where @xmath184 is the outward unit normal vector field to the hypersurface @xmath185 . if @xmath181 as in ( a2 ) , we have @xmath195 , and @xmath196 .",
    "note that for @xmath197 , that is @xmath185 with the opposite orientation we have @xmath198 . for details of this construction , and proofs of the preceding statements ,",
    "we refer again to the literature @xcite .    in general the symplectic form does not need to be non - degenerate . per @xcite this degeneracy",
    "is related to the presence of gauge orbits , or equivalently , the non uniqueness of the extension of solutions from the neighbourhood of a surface to the entire space time . due to our assumption",
    "a3 this is not the case here , and we will assume non - degeneracy from here on .    by ( a3 ) , we obtain from @xmath199 a symplectic structure @xmath200 on the space @xmath201 of global solutions on @xmath182 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath202 and @xmath203 coincide and just call both @xmath204 .",
    "this means that @xmath205 , and @xmath206 where @xmath207 .",
    "this is of course just the case we described for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "note that if we have an element @xmath208 that extends to a solution on the interior of @xmath182 we have that @xmath209 and @xmath210 denote the same element of @xmath201 , and thus elements @xmath211 , @xmath212 that extend to the interior of @xmath182 have @xmath213 .",
    "therefore @xmath201 forms a lagrangian subspace of @xmath193 .",
    "this property is actually not specific to our case , but true more generally , we refer the interested reader to the literature @xcite .",
    "we now pick a _ polarization _",

    "the main difference between the case of timelike hypersurfaces and spacelike hypersurfaces is the appearance of exponentially increasing and decreasing solutions to the euler - lagrange equations called evanescent waves in contrast to the usual propagating waves .",

    "we will investigate the case of propagating waves in section [ sec : noclick ] and evanescent waves in section [ sec : experimsituation ] .",
    "it is there that we will arrive at the main result of this article which is that the choice of complex structure for evanescent waves depends on the physical setup outside of the region of interest , and thus no general arguments can determine a unique complex structure for these modes .      in this section",
    "we show how the detector response can be used to formulate a condition that determines the complex structure for propagating waves when we claim that the complex structure may possess all the symmetries of the spacetime region .",
    "the idea is to require that all one particle states with outgoing energy flux have no probability of exciting the detector at rest .",
    "we are dealing with @xmath299 dimensional minkowski space and a region @xmath346 $ ] bounded by parallel timelike hyperplanes @xmath303 and @xmath304 where @xmath303 is oriented as @xmath185 pointing outside of the region @xmath182 and @xmath304 has opposite orientation . hence , the symmetries in the global coordinates in which the time direction is tangential to the timelike hyperplanes and in which the metric takes the form @xmath301 at every point of @xmath182 are time translation and time reversal .",
    "we use exactly this coordinate system in the following .",
    "the symplectic form is then given as @xmath347 we assume the unruh - dewitt detector to be at rest , i.e. @xmath348 inside the region @xmath182 throughout this whole section ( see figure [ fig : detectorm ] ) .",
    "containing the worldline @xmath319 of the detector at rest .",
    "the horizontal axis represents space and the vertical axis time .",
    "[ fig : detectorm ] ]    the additional ingredient for determining the complex structure is the no - click condition for propagating waves which is the following requirement : we introduce the set of positive flux modes @xmath349 consisting of solutions @xmath350 fulfilling @xmath351 at every point @xmath352 with @xmath353 the energy momentum tensor of the field and @xmath184 the unit normal covector field to @xmath354 pointing out of the region @xmath182 .",
    "now , to determine the complex structure we require that the set of states corresponding to positive flux modes should give a vanishing transition rate of the detector . +",
    "* comparison to the case of spacelike hypersurfaces * + let us briefly consider the condition that all one particle states with outgoing energy flux have no probability of exciting the detector at rest , which we formalized above , for the case of two spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "in that case we have a priori 4 modes per energy subspace of the complexified state space at each spacelike hypersurface , two future pointing , and two past pointing .    out of these",
    "the complex structure picks two per surface as @xmath93 eigenvalues , or , physically speaking , `` positive '' energy modes .",
    "the condition that we consider the modes that flow out of the space time then choses the past pointing modes for the past hypersurface and the future - pointing modes for the future hypersurface . on the other hand , the usual complex structure choses the future pointing modes in both cases .",
    "thus the intersection between the two are the positive frequency modes on the future hyperplane , and we are considering vacuum to one particle transitions , which , with the detector in the ground state , can not happen .",
    "any other choice of modes for the complex structure would lead to the presence of modes on the past hypersurface , and thus allow for the excitation of the detector . thus turning the above on its head",
    ", we can use the condition that the detector should not click for outward pointing modes to uniquely fix the complex structure in the case of spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "note again that we have two separate notions of positivity here , one determined by the complex structure , and the other , independently of it , by the energy flux of a certain mode .",
    "the condition that energy should be flowing out of the region can be seen simply as a generalized version of the condition that the past hypersurface should be in the vacuum state . in particular it is a notion that survives complexification and thus can be used , in combination with the detector response , to pick the vacuum state .",
    "+ to make the no - click condition mathematically clear we first assume that we are dealing with a unitary complex structure as defined in section [ sec : timeev ] . since the complex structure respects the symmetries of the classical configuration we can deal with all the energy subspaces of @xmath355 separately . to determine the complex structure we look at the space @xmath356 with @xmath357 where @xmath358 . using this split",
    "we investigate the no - click condition for elements of @xmath359 with @xmath360 introduced above .",
    "we find that on @xmath303 the condition in equation ( [ eq : posflux ] ) becomes @xmath361 and with the opposite sign on @xmath304 .",

    "then , we have @xmath371 the no - click condition is required to hold for every element of @xmath360 , that is for every set of coefficients @xmath372 and @xmath373 . considering the special case of @xmath374 and @xmath375 we obtain that @xmath376 which means that for the detector not to click we need @xmath377 which leads to @xmath378 and with complex conjugation @xmath379 . together with the time reversal invariance which tells us that @xmath380 and @xmath381 this already determines the complex structure to be @xmath382 putting this back into equation ( [ eq : xi_+ ] ) we find @xmath383 with ( [ eq : probposflux ] ) we obtain that the no - click condition is fulfilled independently of the choice of the coefficients @xmath372 and @xmath373 as it was required .",
    "in particular , this includes states that can be seen as consisting of a one particle state on the right and the vacuum state on the left hypersurface and vice versa .",
    "but the above considerations were much more general as we also considered general one particle states on the whole boundary @xmath354 .",
    "+ for evanescent wave solutions the property to be in the set of positive flux modes fulfilling condition ( [ eq : posflux ] ) depends on the position of the hypersurface , i.e. for two hypersurfaces @xmath343 and @xmath384 at @xmath344 and @xmath385 respectively the set of positive flux modes is a different subset of @xmath386 . in the derivation of the complex structure via the no - click condition we used explicitly",

    "this was done by fixing the initial state on the initial hypersurface to be the vacuum state .",
    "this is more complicated in the case of a timelike hypersurface .",
    "however , we can use the transition probability of the detector itself to decide which states correspond to ingoing and outgoing particles by comparing the result to the canonical case : the transition probability from the ground state to the excited state of the detector was zero in the canonical case . from equation ( [ eq : detprob1 ] ) with @xmath436 , we obtain that the one particle states @xmath449 in @xmath450 that are given such that @xmath451 with @xmath452 and @xmath336 derived from @xmath253 as defined in equation ( [ eq : hatxi ] ) lead to a vanishing transition probability . hence , they are the outgoing states .",
    "conversely , the ingoing one particle states are linear combinations of the states @xmath449 given such that @xmath451 with @xmath453 .",
    "we obtain that for two one particle states we have @xmath454 where the symmetric , bilinear map @xmath455 is extended to @xmath386 as @xmath456 for real @xmath457 .",
    "hence , two one particle states corresponding to @xmath253 and @xmath458 are orthogonal if and only if the corresponding @xmath336 and @xmath459 are orthogonal with respect to @xmath455 .",
    "the complex structure @xmath432 defined in equations ( [ eq : jldef ] ) and ( [ eq : jrdef ] ) leaves the energy eigenspaces @xmath460 invariant .",
    "hence , @xmath432 maps ingoing states to ingoing states and outgoing states to outgoing states , and we find from the definition of @xmath455 from @xmath461 and @xmath432 that ingoing and outgoing states are orthogonal .",
    "let us now consider just the ingoing states to show that we recover the canonical result in equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) for the transition of the detector from its excited state to its ground state : since the complex structure defined by equations ( [ eq : jldef ] ) and ( [ eq : jrdef ] ) leaves the energy eigenspaces @xmath462 invariant , we see from equation ( [ eq : stateprod ] ) that two ingoing states @xmath463 and @xmath464 are orthogonal if @xmath451 and @xmath465 with @xmath466 . hence , we obtain an orthonormal set of ingoing one particle states by specifying a set of orthonormal one particle states @xmath467 and @xmath468 corresponding to solutions @xmath469 in @xmath462 for every @xmath470 .    from equation ( [ eq : stateprod ] ) we know that the orthonormality of the one particle states @xmath471 and @xmath472 is equivalent to the orthonormality of @xmath473 and @xmath474 with respect to the sesquilinear map @xmath475 which is anti - linear in the second entry .",
    "we start with the two linearly independent eigenfunctions of @xmath309 defining @xmath476 and @xmath477 .",
    "we define the normalization constant @xmath478 such that @xmath479 .",
    "an orthonormal basis in the one particle sector is then given by the set @xmath471 and @xmath472 , where @xmath480 with @xmath481 such that @xmath482 . from equation ( [ eq : detprob2 ] )",
    "we find the corresponding response of the detector as @xmath483 now , we insert the eigenfunctions of the complex structure defined in equations ( [ eq : jldef ] ) and ( [ eq : jrdef ] ) and recover the expression in equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) as it is shown in appendix [ sec : canres ] .    while this is not the only possible complex structure here , it is very instructive to see what happens if we use the equations of motion to unitarily propagate the hypersurface @xmath303 and @xmath304 and the corresponding complex structures to the regions @xmath389 and @xmath390 respectively by considering only the global solution defined in ( [ eq : solutions ] ) which are in one - to - one correspondence with field configurations on @xmath303 and @xmath304 , respectively - dimensional minkowski space and a region bounded by a timelike hyper - cylinder in @xcite . ] .    employing the boundary conditions in equation ( [ eq : boundcond ] ) ,",
    "we obtain for the global solutions @xmath484 and @xmath485 note also that , as in the canonical theory , the extensions to the regions @xmath389 and @xmath390 of @xmath486 and @xmath487 respectively are only continuous , but not analytic at @xmath488 since the spacetime metric @xmath103 has a discontinuity at @xmath394 respectively @xmath395 .",
    "thus in particular an arbitrarily small region in spacetime will no longer automatically contain the complete information on all spacetime without recurse to the equations of motion .",
    "mathematically it is this fact that allows us to study the dependence of the complex structure on the physics outside of the spacetime region .    through equation ( [ eq : unitpropl ] ) , , ( [ eq : unitpropr ] ) and",
    "respectively we see that the corresponding unitarily propagated complex structure in region @xmath389 and @xmath390 coincides with the complex structure given in equation ( [ eq : jtimelike ] ) ,    @xmath489    this is just the complex structure that we found to be the natural one for propagating waves in section [ sec : noclick ] .",
    "thus the complex structure we gave above for evanescent waves is directly related to a natural complex structure for the propagating waves that they turn into asymptotically .",
    "this further confirms our interpretation of the complex structure , as the correct one for these evanescent modes , and thus that the complex structure , and therefore the vacuum state , on timelike boundaries can depend on the physics outside of the space time region they bound .",
    "in this article we introduced an unruh - dewitt detector model in the framework of the general boundary formulation ( gbf ) of quantum field theory .",
    "the unruh - dewitt detector is frequently used in quantum optics and quantum field theory as a toy model for the interaction of fields with matter systems like atoms . in particular , the unruh - dewitt detector is used to model situations of accelerated observers moving in flat spacetimes or general inertial or non - inertial observers moving in curved spacetimes . usually , this is done to gain a better understanding of effects that predict the particle creation in the vacuum like the unruh effect or the hawking effect .",
    "the introduction of an unruh - dewitt detector in the gbf allows for the investigation of such questions employing the advantages of the gbf framework : there is no restriction of the spacetime region that can be considered .",
    "especially , regions with timelike hypersurfaces can be considered , e.g. in the case of a region with timelike boundary completely outside of the horizon of an eternal black hole could be considered .    beside this , the unruh - dewitt detector we introduced could be used to investigate the general boundary quantum field theory in desitter space and anti - desitter space for which unique vacuum states and s - matrices were introduced in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we used the unruh - dewitt detector model to show that the transition rates of a detector when coupled to a scalar field are an appropriate tool to determine the complex structure for propagating wave modes of the scalar field . in order to study this physical situation we had to re - express the condition that we have a transition from the vacuum to the one particle sector in gbf language .",
    "we saw that considering energy fluxes was a viable method in our case .",
    "however , we only studied these for the highly symmetric and simple case of a region in minkowski space bounded by parallel timelike hyperplanes .",
    "an interesting open problem then is to understand the fully quantized energy momentum tensor and its detailed dependence on the complex structure .",
    "this would allow us to handle a much richer class of physical phenomena .",
    "we considered evanescent modes of a scalar field in a particular spacetime configuration representing a toy model for the physical situation of the electromagnetic field in the vacuum between two dielectric slabs .",
    "we found that even if the spacetime region under consideration is isometric to a region in minkowski space the complex structure depends on the physics outside the spacetime region , where the metric might differ from the minkowskian . in this sense",
    "we can not describe the physics in a spacetime region purely locally without considering the embedding of the region into a spacetime .",
    "this result should be contrasted with the classic result of reeh and schlieder @xcite in algebraic quantum field theory .",
    "they showed that the vacuum state of minkowski space is a highly non - local structure . to compare to the language of algebraic quantum field theory we could describe the physical situation considered above as such : consider two different static spacetimes , which coincide in a certain region .",
    "if we model the vacuum state of the second spacetime in the first one by applying operators localized outside of the region where the spacetimes coincide , we will generically change the vacuum state inside the coinciding region , too .",
    "the restrictions of the vacuum states to the coinciding spacetime region do not coincide , which is exactly what we found . as the response of the detector to evanescent modes is exponentially decaying away from the dielectric boundary , we have in some sense that , as in aqft , the non - locality is exponentially small .",
    "note further that though it may seem at first sight that this example violates the generally covariant locality principle @xcite , it is only the vacuum state that exhibits this non - locality , not the observables .",

    ", it satisfies all vacuum axioms posed in @xcite . note that while the vacuum state is uniquely determined here , its actual functional form depends on the complex structure .",
