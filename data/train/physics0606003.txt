    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are spectacular eruptions in the solar corona .",
    "in addition to 10@xmath3 g of plasma , cmes carry a huge amount of magnetic flux and helicity into the heliosphere .",
    "their interplanetary manifestations ( icmes ) often show a regular magnetic pattern ; icmes with this pattern have been classified as magnetic clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "mcs are characterized by a strong magnetic field , a smooth and coherent rotation of the magnetic field vector , and a depressed proton temperature compared to the ambient solar wind [ burlaga et al . , 1981 ] .",
    "mcs drive many space weather events and affect the solar wind throughout the heliosphere , so it is important to understand their spatial structure .",

    "indirect evidence , both from observations and numerical simulations , suggests that mcs are highly flattened and distorted due to their interaction with the ambient solar wind .",

    "the axis - centered distance @xmath9 and polar angle @xmath10 in the flux - rope cross section translate to the heliographic distance ( @xmath11 ) and latitude ( @xmath12 ) assuming kinematic evolution [ riley and crooker , 2004 ; owens et al .",
    ", 2006 ] @xmath13 and @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the solar wind speed and @xmath16 is the ratio of the expansion speed at the rope edge ( relative to the rope center ) to the solar wind speed .",
    "the left flux rope is propagating into a uniform solar wind with a speed of @xmath17 km s@xmath18 , while the right one is propagating into a solar wind with a latitudinal speed gradient @xmath19 km s@xmath18 . after 4 days",
    "these flux ropes arrive at 1 au . due to the expansion of the solar wind ,",
    "plasmas on different stream lines move apart while the magnetic tension in the flux rope tries to keep them together .",
    "since the flow momentum overwhelms the magnetic force after a few solar radii , the flux rope is stretched azimuthally but its angular extent is conserved , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "the left case is representative of solar maximum , when the solar wind speed is roughly uniform in the meridianal plane .",
    "the right panel represents solar minimum , when fast solar wind originates from large polar coronal holes and slow wind is confined to low latitudes associated with helmet streamers [ e.g. , mccomas et al . ,",
    "the flux rope is bent convexly outward by a spherical expansion of the solar wind ( left panel ) or concavely outward by a structured wind ( right panel ) .        from figure  1",
    ", we obtain a simple relationship between the latitude @xmath12 of an observing spacecraft and the normal elevation angle @xmath20 of the flux rope at the spacecraft @xmath21 the radius of curvature , @xmath22 , is defined such that it is positive when the flux rope is curved away from the sun ( left panel ) and negative when curved toward the sun ( right panel ) . in the left case , @xmath23 ,",
    "so equation  1 is reduced to @xmath24 . since mcs",
    "are highly flattened as discussed above , the normal would be along the minimum variance direction of the flux - rope magnetic field .",
    "the radius of curvature of mcs can be extracted from equation  1 by examining the latitudinal distribution of the normal elevation angles .",
    "lower limits for the transverse size of mcs can be derived from pairs of spacecraft widely separated in latitude .",
    "ulysses , complemented with a near - earth spacecraft , is particularly useful for this research since it covers latitudes up to 80@xmath0 [ e.g. , hammond et al .",
    ", 1995 ; gosling et al . , 1995 ] .",
    "this paper applies the above methodology to give the first direct observational evidence for the large - scale transverse size and curvature of mcs .",
    "the data and analysis methods are described in section  2 .",
    "sections  3 and 4 give lower limits for the transverse size of mcs and study how they are curved in different solar wind states , respectively .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results in section  5 .",
    "to give a meaningful measure of the transverse size , we need at least two spacecraft separated as widely as possible in the solar meridianal plane . launched in 1991 , ulysses explores the solar wind conditions at distances from 1 to 5.4 au and up to 80@xmath0 in latitude .",
    "wind and ace have provided near - earth measurements ( within 7@xmath0 of the solar equatorial plane ) since 1994 and 1998 , respectively .",
    "we first look for mcs in ulysses data when it is more than 30@xmath0 away from the solar equator .",
    "if we see the same mc at the near - earth spacecraft , then its transverse width is at least the spacecraft separation . to determine if the spacecraft observe the same mc , we look at the timing and data similarities ( similar transient signatures , the same chirality , etc . ) , and use a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) mhd model to do data alignment .",
    "we require that the mc axis lie close to the solar equatorial plane .",
    "otherwise , the width we invert is the length of the flux rope other than the transverse size of the cross section ; this requirement also minimizes the effect of axial curvature .",
    "in addition , our curvature study needs mcs not to be aligned with the radial direction .",
    "wind observations in 1995 - 1997 are used to investigate the mc curvature near solar minimum , while ulysses as well as the near - earth spacecraft provides observations from 1999 to 2003 for the curvature study near solar maximum .",
    "single - point observations can only sample mcs at a specific distance .",
    "as mcs propagate in the solar wind , they may change appreciably .",
    "models are needed to connect observations at different spacecraft .",
    "studies to compare icme observations at various locations have been performed , using icme signatures and an mhd simulation to trace their evolution [ e.g. , wang et al . , 2001 ; richardson et al . , 2002 ; riley et al . ,",
    "we follow the same approach and use a 1-d mhd model developed by wang et al . [ 2000 ] to propagate the solar wind from 1 au to ulysses .",
    "momentum and energy source terms resulting from the interaction between solar wind ions and interstellar neutrals can be included in this model , but we drop them since they have a negligible effect on the solar wind propagation within ulysses distance .",
    "all physical quantities at the inner boundary ( 1 au ) are set to the average near - earth solar wind conditions ; the mhd equations are then solved by a piecewise parabolic scheme to give a steady state solar wind solution .",
    "observations at 1 au ( typically 60 days long ) containing the icme data are introduced into the model as perturbations .",
    "the numerical calculation stops when the perturbation has traveled to ulysses .",
    "the model output is compared with ulysses observations .",
    "note that the 1-d model assumes spherical symmetry , so we do not expect the model output to exactly match the ulysses data .",
    "nevertheless , large stream structures should be similar and allow us to align these data sets .",
    "the axis orientation of mcs is needed to specify their global structure .",
    "minimum variance analysis ( mva ) of the measured magnetic field yields useful principle axes [ e.g. , sonnerup and cahill , 1967 ; sonnerup and scheible , 1998 ] . a normal direction , @xmath25 , can be identified by minimizing the deviation of the field component @xmath26 from @xmath27 for a series of measurements of @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the average magnetic field vector .",

    "eigenvectors of the matrix , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , corresponding to the eigenvalues in order of decreasing magnitude , denote the the maximum , intermediate and minimum variance directions .",
    "the normal of an elongated flux rope should be along the minimum variance direction ( see figure  1 ) ; the maximum variance would occur azimuthally since the azimuthal component changes its sign across the flux rope ; the intermediate variance direction is identified as the axis orientation due to the non - uniform distribution of the axial field over the flux - rope cross section .",
    "the mva method also gives the chirality of the flux - rope fields as shown in the bottom panels of figures  2 , 3 and 4 .",

    "the key idea in reconstructing the flux rope is that the thermal pressure @xmath51 and the axial field @xmath52 are functions of @xmath53 alone .",
    "the flux - rope orientation is determined by the single - valued behavior of the transverse pressure @xmath54 over the vector potential @xmath53 , which essentially requires that the same field line be crossed twice by an observing spacecraft .",

    "smooth rotations of about 180@xmath0 in the magnetic field ( bottom panels ) indicate a left - handed chirality .",

    "the model outputs at ulysses agree qualitatively well with the observed speed profiles .",
    "note that the model - predicted and observed speeds were not shifted to produce this agreement . for case  3 ( right panel )",
    ", the model predicts a slower solar wind than observed at ulysses , which is reasonable given the large latitudinal separation ( 72@xmath0 ) between ace and ulysses and possible differences in the ambient solar wind .",
    "based on the good stream alignment and data similarities shown in figures  2 , 3 and 4 , we conclude that the two spacecraft see the same events .",
    "the mcs listed in table  1 offer observational evidence for the large transverse size of icmes . in order to quantify the transverse size",
    ", we examine the latitudinal separation between ace and ulysses for these mcs . the latitudinal separation ( @xmath77 )",
    "serves as a measure of the transverse size , @xmath78 , expressed as @xmath79 where @xmath11 is the heliocentric distance of the mcs at ulysses .",
    "this equation explicitly assumes that the latitudinal extent of the mcs is constant during their propagation through the solar wind .",
    "the results for the present mcs are plotted in figure  6 .",
    "the transverse size given by the above equation is much larger than the mcs radial width obtained from their average speed multiplied by the time duration .",
    "as can seen from figure  6 , the largest aspect ratio is @xmath80 .",
    "the pr event has a ratio of @xmath81 since @xmath77 is only 15.3@xmath0 for this case .",
    "figure  6 reveals that the mcs have a cross section greatly elongated in the latitudinal direction .",
    "the large transverse size can also be inferred from the shock standoff distance @xmath82 ahead of fast mcs written as [ russell and mulligan , 2002 ] @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the mach number of the preceding shock , and @xmath86 is the characteristic scale of mcs , presumably a measure of @xmath78 . from the superposed epoch data of 18 near - earth mcs with preceding shocks in liu et al . [ 2006b , figure  8 ] , we have @xmath87 and @xmath88 au on average .",
    "substitution of these values into the above equation gives @xmath89 au , which corresponds to a latitudinal extent of @xmath2 69@xmath0 obtained from equation  7 .",
    "consistent with our direct evidence , the transverse size of mcs ( or icmes in general ) could be very large .",
    "a direct consequence of the large transverse size is that mcs encounter different solar wind flows in the meridianal plane .",
    "mcs can thus be highly distorted depending on the ambient solar wind conditions .",
    "the simplified scenario described in section  1 indicates that mcs should be ideally concave outward at solar minimum and convex outward during solar maximum .",
    "this curvature effect results in an inverse correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath12 at solar minimum and a positive correlation near solar maximum as shown by equation  1 .",
    "note , however , that this is a greatly simplified picture . in reality",
    ", the shape of mcs will be determined by the speed at which they travel with respect to the background solar wind , ambient magnetic fields , the presence of other icmes or obstacles nearby , and other features that are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "as discussed in section  2 , the distortion effect by solar wind flows would be most prominent if mcs have axes close to the solar equator and perpendicular to the radial direction . in order to have enough events for our curvature analysis",
    ", we include all the mcs whose axes lie within 30@xmath0 of the solar equatorial plane and more than 30@xmath0 away from the radial direction .      close to solar minimum",
    ", the solar wind is well ordered with fast wind originating from polar coronal holes and slow wind near the solar equatorial plane .",
    "wind observations from 1995 - 1997 are used to assess the distortion effect of the latitudinal flow gradient on mcs .",
    "figure  7 shows the normal elevation angles for the 14 events observed at wind .",
    "the error bars are obtained from equation  5 .",
    "an inverse correlation is observed between @xmath20 and @xmath12 , except for three events .",
    "the mcs are expected to be concave outward during solar minimum , which is largely observed , made evident by the inverse relationship plotted as a solid line .",
    "the three events where @xmath20 and @xmath12 have the same sign indicate a convex outward curvature , contrary to the solar minimum prediction",
    ". a closer look at the 1997 may 15 event reveals an increasing speed profile indicative of a high - speed stream interacting with the sunward edge of the mc . as a result , the mc is bent to be convex outward . note that the simplified picture described in section  1 assumes a minimum solar wind speed at the solar equator .",
    "it is conceivable that @xmath20 and @xmath12 may have the same sign if the minimum speed shifts away from the zero latitude .",
    "although the breakdown of the assumption is a possible explanation for the other two exceptions , this effect may be negligible since most of the events in figure  7 have the inverse correlation .",
    "the best fit to the data that show the inverse correlation , obtained with a least squares analysis of equation  1 , gives a radius of curvature of @xmath90 au . compared with the convex - outward representation ( dashed line )",
    ", the data clearly show the trend pictured by the right panel of figure  1 .      at solar maximum",
    ", the solar wind speed tends to be more uniform over heliographic latitude .",
    "we use ulysses observations between 1999 and 2003 to quantify the curvature effect of solar wind spherical expansion on mcs .",
    "our prescription yields 13 events shown in figure  8 . in a uniform solar wind the mcs would have a radius of curvature equal to their distance from the sun , which results in a proportional relationship , i.e. , @xmath91 from equation  1 .",
    "only two events do not have a positive correlation .",
    "more specifically , @xmath20 and @xmath12 have opposite signs for the two events .",
    "they are the first and last ones in the time series of the mcs ; as indicated by the dates , they may not truly come from the solar maximum environment .",
    "the data nearby the @xmath91 curve ( dashed line ) manifest a convex - outward structure at solar maximum as illustrated by the left panel of figure  1 .",
    "we have investigated the transverse size and curvature of the mc cross section , based on ace , wind and ulysses observations .",
    "the results provide compelling evidence that mcs are highly stretched in the latitudinal direction and curved in a fashion depending on the background solar wind .",
    "three mcs , whose axes are close to the solar equator and roughly perpendicular to the radial direction , are shown to pass ace and ulysses ( widely separated in latitude ) successively . the mva method combined with the gs reconstruction technique",
    "is used to determine the axis orientation and the observations at ace and ulysses are linked using a 1-d mhd model . the latitudinal separation between ace and ulysses",
    "gives a lower limit to the mcs transverse size .",
    "varying from 40@xmath0 to 70@xmath0 , it reveals that the transverse size can be very large .",
    "the flattened cross section is a natural result of a flux rope subtending a constant angle as it propagates from the sun through the heliosphere ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the radius of curvature is obtained from a simple relationship between the mc normal elevation angle and the latitude of an observing spacecraft .",
    "the curvature of mcs in the solar wind with a latitudinal speed gradient at solar minimum differs from that in the uniform - speed solar wind near solar maximum . at solar minimum , mcs",
    "are bent concave - outward by the structured solar wind with a radius of curvature of about 0.3 au ; at solar maximum , they tend to be convex outward with the radius of curvature proportional to their heliographic distance .",
    "the distortion of mcs , resulting from the interaction with the ambient solar wind , is mainly a kinematic effect since magnetic forces are dominated by the flow momentum [ riley and crooker , 2004 ] .",
    "improvement of our knowledge of the global structure of mcs ( or generic icmes ) is of critical importance for heliosphere physics and space weather prediction .",
    "proper estimates of the magnetic flux and helicity of icmes require knowledge of the structure to quantify their connection with the coronal origin and to assess the modulation of heliospheric flux by cmes .",
    "the large transverse size and curvature can alter the global configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field as icmes sweep through the heliosphere .",
    "numerical simulations show that the ambient magnetic field extending from the sun to high latitudes may bend poleward to warp around the flattened flux rope [ e.g. , manchester et al . ,",
    "2004 ] , as initially proposed by gosling and mccomas [ 1987 ] and mccomas et al .",
    "the field line draping leads to favorable conditions for the formation of plasma depletion layers and mirror mode instabilities in the sheath region of fast icmes [ liu et al . , 2006b ] .",
    "a magnetic field bent southward would also allow for strong coupling between the solar wind and the magnetosphere via field line merging [ dungey , 1961 ] .",
    "the curvature of icmes could modify the shape of preceding shock fronts , affecting plasma flows and particle acceleration at the shocks .",
    "how general icmes are distorted remains unaddressed .",
    "since their magnetic field is not well organized , the difficulty resides in how to best estimate their axis orientation .",
    "future stereo observations will provide perspectives for their geometry and also quantitatively test our results for mcs .",

    "<S> we present direct evidence that magnetic clouds ( mcs ) have highly flattened and curved cross section resulting from their interaction with the ambient solar wind . </S>",

    "<S> application of the model to wind observations from 1995 - 1997 ( close to solar minimum ) shows that the cross section is bent concavely outward by a structured solar wind with a radius of curvature of @xmath2 0.3 au . near solar maximum </S>",
    "<S> , mcs tend to be convex outward in the solar wind with a uniform speed ; the radius of curvature is proportional to the heliographic distance of mcs , as demonstrated by ulysses observations between 1999 and 2003 . </S>",
