    "the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking has been searched for decades in past accelerators and on - going experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in the standard model(sm ) ,",
    "a scalar @xmath4 doublet is responsible for the symmetry breaking .",
    "the intrinsic problems associated the sm has intrigued the expectation of new physics at tev scale . however , no evidence of new physics has been found so far at the lhc with @xmath5 tev . at the same time , both the atlas and cms collaborations@xcite have reported on the search of sm higgs with @xmath65 fb@xmath7 data and the results show a first hint of sm higgs with @xmath8 gev .",
    "this motivates us to study its implications in vacuum stability and perturbativity bounds within the extension of the sm including neutrino physics and dark matter ( dm ) . in the sm",
    ", the stability of the vacuum is tightly related with the mass of physical higgs since the quartic self - coupling @xmath1 is connected with @xmath9 , @xmath10(@xmath11 gev ) .",
    "if @xmath9 is too small , the radiative corrections , mainly from the top quark s contribution , can drive @xmath1 negative , induce a false and deep minimum at large field values and destabilize the electroweak vacuum . in terms of no clue to new physics beyond the sm at the lhc , the analysis of the stability for @xmath12 gev can give useful hints on the structure of ultraviolet scale where the new physics may come in .    on the other hand ,",
    "non - collider experimental results confront the sm with two major puzzles : neutrino masses and dark matter .",
    "the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations show that at least two neutrinos have nonzero but small masses located around sub - ev scale .",
    "evidences from astrophysics and cosmology have pointed out that the ordinary baryonic matter is not the dominant form of material in the universe .",
    "rather , about @xmath13 of energy density of the universe is non - luminous and non - absorbing matter , called dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "enclosing dark matter and the massiveness of neutrino into sm may have effects on the higgs sector for the analysis of stability of vacuum .",
    "although the exact nature of dark matter and neutrino mass is still unknown and their interactions with sm particle vary for different models , there exist several guidelines for our purpose to analyze the vacuum stability . based on sm gauge structure and changing the sm higgs potential in a controllable way",
    ", the model should introduce new particles as less as possible to make the analysis of stability possible and necessary .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce two scenarios of the neutrino and the dm respectively , and explain why the our studied frameworks change minimally the scalar potential of the sm . then we analyze the vacuum stability and perturbativity bounds in these frameworks . in section",
    "iv we give a summary and conclude our results .",
    "within the context of the sm , no dirac mass term of neutrino can be written due to the absence of right - handed neutrino fields . if the neutrinos are majorana fermions , that is , the lepton number is no longer a conserved quantity , one can write a dimension - five operator which is relevant to the neutrino masses  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the @xmath2 leptonic doublets with the flavor indices @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the higgs field .",
    "this operator violates lepton number by two units ( @xmath18 ) , and hence m corresponds to the lepton number breaking scale .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs field develops vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath19 with @xmath20 gev , and the neutrino masses @xmath21 are generated . in order to obtain the neutrino masses at sub - ev scale one either assume @xmath22 with a sizable couplings @xmath23 or assume @xmath24 is achievable in the collider experiments with highly suppressed couplings @xmath23 .",
    "one of the most popular approaches to generate the neutrino masses corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ numass ] ) at tree level is the so - called `` seesaw mechanism '' . in this kind of models",
    "the neutrino masses are suppressed by a large factor due to the masses of heavy sectors .",
    "the heavy fields are either fermions or scalars , therefore , three variations of seesaw mechanisms are introduced . in the so - called type",
    "- i  @xcite and type - iii  @xcite seesaw mechanism models , the leptonic @xmath2 singlet and triplet fermions are introduced respectively . instead of introducing new fermions to the sm , the type - ii seesaw model  @xcite uses a @xmath2 triplet scalar carrying a hypercharge @xmath25 to give neutrino masses through the new yukawa interactions between the new triplet scalar and the sm leptonic doublet fields .",
    "this triplet scalar brings additional six parameters to the scalar potential which makes the analysis of vacuum stability unclear and complicated .",
    "so for the purpose of this paper , we concentrate on type - i and type - iii seesaw mechanisms and discuss their effects on the vacuum stability bounds .",
    "_ type - i seesaw mechanism _ : one adds @xmath26 @xmath2 singlet fermions to the sm particle content , usually these particles are treated as the right - handed neutrinos @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath28 fields do not carry any sm quantum numbers , one can write the relevant lagrangian in the neutrino sector as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the dirac yukawa couplings , @xmath32 is the charge conjugation , and @xmath33 are the majorana masses in the diagonal basis of right - handed neutrinos . after block diagonalizing",
    "the mass matrix of left and right handed neutrinos , one obtained the standard seesaw formula for the effective light neutrino mass matrix , @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the dirac mass matrix of neutrinos .",
    "radiative corrections from @xmath36 can contribute the higgs effective potential and have an effect on the vacuum stability .",
    "_ type - iii seesaw mechanism _ : instead of the exchange of heavy fermion singlet fields in the type - i seesaw model , type - iii seesaw mechanism is mediated by heavy fermions @xmath37 which have zero hypercharge and are transformed as a triplet in the adjoint representation under the @xmath2 gauge group .",
    "the triplet can be written in the tensor form , @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the pauli matrices and @xmath40 .",
    "one can also write the charge conjugated form of @xmath37 , @xmath41 note that @xmath42 are left - handed fields . with the definition @xmath43 ,",
    "one find the diagonal neutral fields of @xmath44 are majorana fermions while off - diagonal charged fields are dirac fermions .",
    "the general lagrangian involving @xmath44 fields is given by @xmath45 - \\frac{1}{2}tr[\\bar{\\sigma}m_{\\sigma}\\sigma ] - \\overline{l_{l\\alpha}}\\sqrt{2}y^{\\dag}_{\\sigma_{\\alpha i}}\\sigma_{i}\\tilde{h } - h^{t}\\epsilon^{t}\\bar{\\sigma}_{i}\\sqrt{2}y_{\\sigma_{\\alpha i}}l_{l_{\\alpha } } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the anti - symmetric tensor , @xmath47 is the dirac - neutrino yukawa coupling matrix , and @xmath48 is the majorana mass matrix of heavy fermion triplets . after the higgs develops vev , the neutral lepton mass matrix in the basis of @xmath49 can be written as @xmath50 in analogous to the type - i seesaw mechanism , the effective light neutrino mass matrix @xmath51 is obtained with the substitutions @xmath52 and @xmath53 . besides the yukawa interaction , the triplets in type - iii seesaw model have gauge interactions and will contribute to the running of gauge coupling , additionally , changing the running of @xmath1 indirectly .",
    "there are convincing evidences from cosmology and astrophysics that @xmath13 of the energy density of the universe is provided by dark matter  @xcite .",

    "one of the popular dm candidates is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) which is stable on cosmological time scale and a thermal relic of the big bang . typically , one of the simplest way to justify the stability of dm is to impose a @xmath54 parity symmetry , for example the r - parity in supersymmetry . in order to study the vacuum stability bounds of higgs sector in the extension of sm including neutrino and dm sectors , we choose two models of dm which minimally change the sm higgs potential and keep the direct relation between higgs quartic - coupling @xmath1 and the electroweak vacuum @xmath55 .    _",

    "<S> motivated by the discovery hint of the standard model ( sm ) higgs mass around 125  gev at the lhc , we study the vacuum stability and perturbativity bounds on higgs scalar of the sm extensions including neutrinos and dark matter ( dm ) . guided by the sm gauge symmetry and the minimal changes in the sm higgs potential we consider two extensions of neutrino sector ( type - i and type - iii seesaw mechanisms ) and dm sector ( a real scalar singlet ( darkon ) and minimal dark matter ( mdm ) ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the darkon contributes positively to the @xmath0 function of the higgs quartic coupling @xmath1 and can stabilize the sm vacuum up to high scale . </S>",
