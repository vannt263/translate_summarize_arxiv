    "single - polarized experiments , making use of the polarized proton and deuteron beams of the cooler storage ring cosy - jlich and unpolarized targets , are extended to double - polarized studies  @xcite by the installation of an internal polarized hydrogen or deuterium storage - cell gas target .",
    "utilizing pure gas of polarized hydrogen or deuterium , these targets circumvent the problem of dilution by unpolarized nucleons and they permit fast change of the polarization direction . in order to compensate for the relatively low areal density",
    ", these targets are placed inside storage rings , where they are traversed by the orbiting beam typically a million times per second . as conceived already some forty years ago  @xcite , a substantial enhancement of the areal target - gas density ( or luminosity ) compared to gas - jet targets by about two orders of magnitude is achieved , when the polarized atoms are injected into an open - ended , t - shaped storage cell . a review describing the capabilities of polarized gas - jet and storage - cell gas targets",
    "is found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the polarized internal target ( pit ) , developed for the magnet spectrometer anke  @xcite in cosy jlich  @xcite , consists of the polarized atomic beam source ( abs ) , the storage cell  @xcite , and the lamb - shift polarimeter ( lsp )  @xcite . in the development of the pit for anke the experience of other groups in the operation of polarized gas targets",
    "could be used .",
    "essentially these are the madison source  @xcite , used by the pintex collaboration at iucf  @xcite , and the filtex source  @xcite used by the hermes collaboration at desy / hamburg  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : ii ] presents the general layout of the abs and it describes the major elements , the pumping system , the layout of the baffles , the dissociator , the nozzle - skimmer setup , the system of sextupole magnets , the high - frequency transition units , and the slow control system .",
    "section  [ sec : iii ] contains studies with the free hydrogen jet from the nozzle . in secs .",
    "iv to vii measurements and results are presented concerning the properties of the beam behind the last magnet , the hydrogen and deuterium beam intensities ( [ sec : iv ] ) , hydrogen beam profiles ( [ sec : v ] ) , the degree of dissociation of the hydrogen beam ( [ sec : vi ] ) , and the polarization values for the hydrogen and deuterium beam ( [ sec : vii ] ) . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : viii ] , the conclusions and an outlook to the future efforts are given .",
    "the procedure of discharge - tube and nozzle conditioning is described in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "the limited space at the target position between the first beam - bending dipole magnet d1 and the central spectrometer dipole magnet d2 of the anke facility  @xcite on the one hand enforces the abs to be mounted in a vertical position contrary to the layout of the earlier sources . on the other hand",
    ", this position allows less complicated supports of the components and easier alignment .",
    "furthermore , the height of the cosy tunnel restricts the vertical dimension of the abs , which requires a very compact layout of the source .",
    "initially , a slight inclination from the vertical abs orientation had been foreseen to avoid drizzling of powder , created during operation of the dissociator , down into the storage cell .",
    "production of such a powder had been observed earlier ( @xmath9  @xcite ,  green powder ",
    "no such powder , however , was found on a glass window at the exit of the abs in vertical position after weeks of dissociator operation .",
    "thus , the inclination could be regarded as unnecessary .",
    "the layout of the abs is presented in fig .",
    "the two main cylindrical vacuum vessels are fixed above and below a central support plate .",
    "the inner diameter of the upper vessel  @xcite is about 390 mm .",

    "the dissociator tube and the coldhead  @xcite with the heat bridge for nozzle cooling are mounted on a three - legged plate .",
    "three screws allow one to adjust the radial nozzle position and the distance to the skimmer .",
    "the upper baffle between chamber i and ii with the beam skimmer is rigidly connected to the upper flange of the vessel . the lower baffle with the diaphragm in front of the first sextupole magnet , separating the chambers ii and iii , can be moved axially from outside to optimize the pumping conditions on the one hand between the skimmer and the diaphragm , and on the other in the narrow region between the diaphragm and the front face of the first magnet .",
    "the first set of three sextupole magnets and the medium field rf transition ( mft ) unit in chamber iii are carried by two rods attached to the central support plate .",
    "the lower vacuum vessel , chamber iv , has a smaller inner diameter of 200 mm .",
    "it houses the second set of three sextupole magnets and a cylindrical beam chopper rotating around a horizontal axis .",
    "the separate chamber v provides space for the weak and strong field rf transition units ( wft and sft units , respectively ) .",
    "the abs can be separated from the anke target chamber and the cosy vacuum system by        a gate valve  @xcite embedded by a dedicated construction into the end flange of chamber v.    two strong turbomolecular pumps are installed at opposite flanges of chamber i perpendicular to the beam direction , one on the beam - up side of chamber ii .",
    "the chambers iii , iv , and v are evacuated by cryopumps . due to space limitation around the abs",

    "the mechanical design took into account that at anke the source has to be mounted vertically and transversely movable together with the transverse motion of the spectrometer magnet d2 .",

    "dedicated tools and methods were developed to determine and to optimize the source parameters , i.e. , intensity , degree of dissociation , and polarization .",
    "special emphasis was put on the measurements of the spatial distributions of the atomic and molecular beam near the focus , where the feeding tube of the storage cell is located .",
