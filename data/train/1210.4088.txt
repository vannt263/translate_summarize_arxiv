    "in recent years there have been several papers studying the effect that flattening a domain has on the eigenvalues of the laplace operator  @xcite ; see also the books  @xcite and the references therein for similar problems with boundary conditions other than dirichlet . in these papers the main objective has been the derivation of the asymptotics of these eigenvalues in terms of a scalar parameter measuring how thin the domain becomes in one direction , as this parameter approaches zero .",
    "as far as we are aware , almost if not all such existing examples in the literature are concerned with domains in euclidean space where the limiting problem degenerates to a domain of zero measure and therefore eigenvalues approach infinity .",
    "a slightly different set of problems which has been considered consists of domains which are perturbations of singular sets such as thin tubular neighbourhoods of graphs , i.e. , domains which locally are like thin tubes ",
    "see  @xcite , for instance , and also  @xcite for a review . as in the papers cited above , again the limiting domains have zero measure and the spectrum behaves in quite a different way from the model considered here .",
    "in this paper we study a situation which , although different from that described in the first paragraph , has in common with it the process by which the limiting domain is approached .",
    "more precisely , consider the case of a given domain @xmath3 in @xmath0 satisfying certain restrictions which for the purpose here may be stated roughly as being bounded from above and below by the graphs of two functions  see section  [ formulation ] for a precise formulation .",
    "the domain @xmath3 is then flattened towards a domain @xmath4 in @xmath5 via a ( continuous ) one - parameter family of domains @xmath6 .",
    "these domains are obtained as the functions mentioned above are multiplied by the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the problem that shall concern us here is the study of the evolution of the eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator on the one - parameter family of compact hypersurfaces @xmath8 which are the boundaries of the domains @xmath6 described above , as @xmath7 approaches zero .",
    "one of the differences in this instance is that while the domain @xmath9 has zero @xmath10measure as stated above , @xmath11 retains positive @xmath12measure , developing instead a singularity on the boundary of the domain @xmath4 ( when considered as a domain in @xmath5 ) .",
    "we thus expect these eigenvalues to remain finite as the parameter @xmath7 approaches zero , and to converge to a limiting spectral problem on the double  sided flat hypersurface .",
    "this is indeed the case , and the relevant spectral problems turn out to be the dirichlet and neumann problems on the domain @xmath4 , with the two next asymptotic terms after that being of orders @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these results have been announced in  @xcite .     with a cross - section at the edge ]    in order to understand the origin of the @xmath1 term in the expansion , it turns out that it is sufficient to consider the case where @xmath15 equals one , that is when the boundary is basically @xmath16 . because of this , it is not necessary to take into consideration the geometric intrincacies of the problem which appear in higher dimensions and it is possible to obtain the full description of eigenvalues in terms of elliptic integrals .",
    "more precisely , for an ellipse of radii @xmath17 and @xmath7 we have that the eigenvalues are given by @xmath18 for @xmath19 and where @xmath20 is the complete elliptic integral of the second type yielding one quarter of the perimeter of the ellipse for @xmath21 .    combining the above with the asymptotic expansion for @xmath22 yields @xmath23    in some sense ,",
    "the purpose of the analysis that we shall carry out in what follows is to show that the above result may actually be extended to higher dimensions .",
    "it should be noted here that this expansion depends on the relation between the different variables at the endpoints of the segment , which in this case is of the form @xmath24 .",
    "clearly different relations between the leading powers will lead to different expansions .    more generally , the issue is that the points of the boundary of @xmath3 where there is a tangent in the direction along which the domain is being flattened will play a special role . throughout the paper",
    "we assume this set of points to be contained in a hyperplane orthogonal to the scaling direction , and that this tangency is simple . in the vicinity of these points",
    "we take the cross - section of our surface as indicated in fig .",
    "[ crosssect ] which , with the assumptions made , will be similar to the one - dimensional ellipse described above .",
    "our results then state that in the higher - dimensional case the asymptotics for the eigenvalues still behave in a similar fashion and thus the logarithmic terms appearing above persist in this more general setting .    apart from the intrinsic interest of the behaviour of the spectrum close to double  sided flat domains , we point out that such manifolds have appeared in the literature in connection with eigenvalues as maximizers of the invariant eigenvalues among all surfaces isometric to surfaces of revolution in @xmath25  @xcite and for hypersurfaces of revolution diffeomorphic to a sphere and isometrically embedded in @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is shown in those papers that these optimal singular _ double flat disks _ maximize the whole invariant spectrum and not just a specific eigenvalue .",
    "another source of interest for such asymptotic expansions lies with the fact that , in some cases , they turn out to be fairly good approximations for low eigenvalues also for values of the parameter @xmath7 away from zero  see  @xcite .",
    "we remark in passing that another problem for which it is conjectured that the optimal shape is given by a double  sided flat disk is alexandrov s conjecture relating the area and diameter of surfaces of non  negative curvature .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a precise formulation of the problem under consideration and state our main results , namely , the nature of the limiting problem and the relation of the limit and approximating operators .",
    "this includes the form of the asymptotic expansion and the expressions for the first three coefficients and an application to the case of the surface of an ellipsoid .",
    "section  [ prelim ] is then devoted to several preliminaries and auxiliary material used in sections  [ unifresconv ] and  [ sec4 ] , where the proofs of the main results are presented .",

    "let us describe briefly the main ideas employed in the proof of the main results .",
    "the proof of the uniform resolvent convergence in theorem  [ th1.1 ] is based on the analysis of the quadratic forms associated with the perturbed and the limiting operators and on the accurate estimates of the functions in certain weighted sobolev spaces .",
    "the proof of the first theorem uses essentially the method of matching asymptotic expansions @xcite for formal construction of the asymptotics for the eigenfunctions associated with @xmath151 .",
    "these asymptotics are constructed as a combination of outer and inner expansions .",
    "the former depends on @xmath55 and its coefficients have singularities at @xmath38 . in the vicinity of @xmath38",

    "after rewriting the eigenvalue equation in the variables @xmath165 , where @xmath63 are local coordinates on @xmath38 , its leading term is in fact the laplace - beltrami operator on the ellipse giving rise to the logarithmic terms in the asymptotics for both the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions .    despite the fact that we are only presenting the leading terms of the asymptotics for @xmath151 and for the associated total projector in theorems  [ th2.3 ] and  [ th4.7 ] , respectively , our approach also allows us to construct the complete asymptotic expansions if required .",
    "although this would need to be checked in a way similar to what was done here for the first few terms , the ansatzes ( [ 4.1 ] ) and ( [ 4.116 ] ) suggest that the complete asymptotic expansion for the eigenvalues should be @xmath166 where @xmath167 are functions holomorphic in @xmath158 .",
    "these higher - order terms would then still reflect the behaviour observed in the ellipse example given in the introduction .",
    "although the above formulas for @xmath168 and ( specially ) @xmath169 may look quite cumbersome at a first glance , they will actually simplify when computed for particular cases as some of the terms involved will vanish depending on whether we are considering dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions on @xmath170 .",
    "we note that a similar effect was already present when computing the coefficients in the expansions obtained in  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly clear in the second of these papers dealing with dimensions higher than two , where the general expression is quite complicated and needs to be computed specifically in each case .",
    "when this is done for general ellipsoids in any dimension , for instance , it yields a much simpler one - line expression .",
    "we shall illustrate this by considering a thin ellipsoidal surface . to this end",
    "take @xmath30 to be the unit disk centred at the origin with @xmath171 in this instance the limiting eigenvalues may be found via separation of variables and they will be of the form @xmath172 , where @xmath173 are the zeroes of the bessel function @xmath174 and its derivative @xmath175 , corresponding to eigenfunctions satisfying dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the following examples illustrating both cases are taken from  @xcite , where the details may be found .",
    "we consider the case of dirichlet boundary conditions first , i.e. , @xmath176 substituting these formulas and ( [ ex2 ] ) into ( [ 2.11a ] ) and ( [ 2.11b ] ) , we then obtain @xmath177 and @xmath178 the asymptotics  ( [ 2.16 ] ) thus become @xmath179 and , for a particular eigenvalue , the remaining integral may be computed numerically .",
    "we illustrate this by considering the case corresponding to the first dirichlet eigenvalue on the disk which yields @xmath180    as an example of limiting multiple eigenvalue we consider the first nontrivial neumann eigenvalue of the disk . in two dimensions",

    "in this section we discuss two parameterizations of the surface @xmath33 and prove three auxiliary lemmas which will be used in the next sections for proving theorems  [ th1.1 ] ,  [ th2.3 ] .",
