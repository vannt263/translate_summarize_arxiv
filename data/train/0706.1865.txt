    "young , massive star clusters ( ymcs ) are the hallmarks of violent star - forming episodes triggered by galaxy collisions and close encounters .",
    "this field has seen major progress and a flurry of renewed interest ever since such ymcs were first reported in the starburst galaxy ngc 1275 by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1992 ) using pre - costar _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images .",
    "the question remains , however , whether or not at least a fraction of the compact ymcs seen in abundance in extragalactic starbursts , are potentially the progenitors of ( @xmath0 gyr ) old globular cluster ( gc)-type objects  although of higher metallicity than the present - day gcs .",
    "if we could settle this issue convincingly , one way or the other , such a result would have far - reaching implications for a wide range of astrophysical questions , including our understanding of the process of galaxy formation and assembly , and the process and conditions required for star ( cluster ) formation .",
    "because of the lack of a statistically significant sample of ymcs in the local group , however , we need to resort to either statistical arguments or to the painstaking approach of case - by - case studies of individual objects in more distant galaxies .",
    "the evolution to old age of young clusters depends crucially on their stellar initial mass function ( imf ) . if the imf slope is too shallow , i.e. , if the clusters are significantly deficient in low - mass stars compared to , e.g. , the solar neighbourhood , they will likely disperse within about a gyr of their formation ( e.g. , chernoff & shapiro 1987 ; chernoff & weinberg 1990 ; goodwin 1997b ; smith & gallagher 2001 ; mengel et al .",
    "2002 ) . as a case in point ,",
    "goodwin ( 1997b ) simulated the evolution of @xmath1 ymcs similar to those observed in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , with imf slopes @xmath2 ( salpeter 1955 ; where the imf is characterised as @xmath3 , as a function of stellar mass , @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 , i.e. , roughly covering the range of ( present - day ) mass function slopes observed in lmc clusters at the time he performed his _ n_-body simulations . following chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) , and based on a detailed comparison between the initial conditions for the lmc",
    "ymcs derived in goodwin ( 1997b ) and the survival chances of massive star clusters in a milky way - type gravitational potential ( goodwin 1997a ) , goodwin ( 1997b ) concluded that  for galactocentric distances @xmath6 kpc  some of his simulated lmc ymcs should be capable of surviving for a hubble time if @xmath7 ( or even @xmath8 ; mengel et al .",
    "2002 ) , but not for shallower imf slopes for any reasonable initial conditions ( cf .",
    "chernoff & shapiro 1987 ; chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) .",
    "more specifically , chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) and takahashi & portegies zwart ( 2000 ) , based on numerical cluster simulations employing the fokker - planck approximation , suggest that the most likely survivors to old age are , additionally , characterised by king model concentrations , @xmath9 .",
    "mengel et al . ( 2002 ; their fig .",
    "9 ) use these considerations to argue that their sample of ymcs observed in the antennae interacting system might survive for at least a few gyr , but see de grijs et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , and bastian & goodwin ( 2006 ) and goodwin & bastian ( 2006 ) , for counterarguments related to environmental effects and to variations in the clusters star - formation efficiencies , respectively .",
    "in addition , ymcs are subject to a variety of internal and external drivers of cluster disruption .",
    "these include internal two - body relaxation effects , the nature of the stellar velocity distribution function , the effects of stellar mass segregation , disk and bulge shocking , and tidal truncation ( e.g. , chernoff & shapiro 1987 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "all of these act in tandem to accelerate cluster expansion , thus leading to cluster dissolution  since expansion will lead to greater vulnerability to tidally - induced mass loss .    with the ever increasing number of large - aperture ground - based telescopes equipped with state - of - the - art high - resolution spectrographs and the wealth of observational data provided by the _ hst _ , we may now finally be getting close to resolving the issue of potential ymc longevity conclusively .",
    "to do so , one needs to obtain ( i ) high - resolution spectroscopy , in order to obtain dynamical mass estimates , and ( ii ) high - resolution imaging to measure their sizes ( and luminosities ) .",
    "one could then construct diagnostic diagrams of ymc mass - to - light ( @xmath10 ) ratio versus age , and compare the ymc loci in this diagram with simple stellar population models using a variety of imf descriptions . in de grijs & parmentier ( 2007 ; their fig .",
    "2 ) we present an updated version of the @xmath10 ratio versus age diagram , including all of the ymcs for which the required observables are presently available .    despite some outstanding issues ( particularly for the youngest clusters )",
    ", it appears that most of the ymcs for which high - resolution spectroscopy is available are characterised by `` standard '' salpeter ( 1955 ) or kroupa ( 2001 ) imfs . as such , a fraction of the ymcs seen today may potentially evolve to become old gcs , depending on their environmental conditions .",
    "following the violent relaxation induced by the supernova - driven expulsion of the left - over star - forming gas , star clusters  at least those that survive the `` infant mortality '' phase ( i.e. , roughly the first 1030 myr of their lives )  settle back into virial equilibrium by the time they reach an age of about 4050 myr ( bastian & goodwin 2006 ; goodwin & bastian 2006 ) .",
    "subsequently , the initial conditions characterising these gas - free bound star clusters are modified as secular evolution proceeds . internal ( two - body relaxation ) and external effects ( due to interactions with the tidal field associated with the underlying galactic gravitational potential ) lead to tidal stripping and the evaporation of a fraction of the low - mass cluster stars , thus resulting in the gradual dissolution of star clusters .",
    "one of the most important diagnostics used to infer the formation history , and to follow the evolution of a star cluster population is the cmf ( i.e. , the number of clusters per constant logarithmic cluster mass interval , @xmath11 ) . of particular importance is the _ initial _ cluster mass function ( icmf ) , since this holds clues to the star and cluster formation processes .",
    "the debate regarding the shape of the icmf , and of the cmf in general , is presently very much alive , both observationally and theoretically .",
    "this is so because it bears on the very essence of the star - forming process , as well as on the formation , assembly history and evolution of the clusters host galaxies over cosmic time . yet , the observable property one has access to is the clf ( i.e. , the number of objects per unit magnitude , @xmath12 ) .    in this respect ,",
    "a remaining contentious issue is whether the observed cmf of ymcs will eventually evolve into that of the ubiquitous old gcs .",
    "the gcmf is a gaussian with a mean @xmath13 ) \\rangle \\sim 5.2 - 5.3 $ ] and a standard deviation of @xmath14 dex .",
    "it seems to be almost universal , both _ among _ and _ within _ galaxies . on the other hand , many cmfs of ymcs appear to be featureless power laws with a spectral index @xmath15 down to a few @xmath16 ( e.g. , de grijs & anders 2006 ; hunter et al . 2003 , for the lmc ) .",
    "some cluster systems exhibit differently shaped icmfs , however ( m82 b , de grijs et al . 2005b , but see smith et al .",
    ", in prep . ;",
    "ngc 1316 , goudfrooij et al . 2004 ; ngc 5253 , cresci et al .",
    "evolving such an initial power - law cmf into the near - invariant gaussian gcmf regardless both of the host galaxy properties and of the details of the cluster loci turns out to be most challenging and requires significant fine - tuning of the models , which is not necessarily compatible with the available observational constraints ( see , e.g. , fall & zhang 2001 vs. vesperini et al .",
    "2003 ; see also vesperini & zepf 2003 ) .    in order to settle the issues of cluster evolution and icmf shape more conclusively ,",
    "major improvements are required in the near future , both observationally and theoretically .",
    "observations reaching low - mass clusters , and with sufficiently accurate photometry , in order to derive reliable cluster ages , are required to follow the temporal evolution of the cmf . from a modeling point of view , a better treatment of the initially loosely bound clusters ( i.e. , the low - concentration clusters ) is required , since these may account for the missing link between the gaussian gcmf and the power laws seen for ymc systems ( vesperini & zepf 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of a time - dependent host galaxy gravitational potential will enable us to better follow the early evolution of both old gcs and ymcs formed in interacting and merging galaxies .",
