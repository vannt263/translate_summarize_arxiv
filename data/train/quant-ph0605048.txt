    "multi - partite entangled states play an important role in quantum information .",
    "they are useful in various quantum information applications , such as in heinsenberg - limited spectroscopy  @xcite , secure communication @xcite , and various schemes related to `` one - way '' quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "fresh theoretical developments on the generation of multipartite entangled states show that sequential techniques may prove to be general and practical for building arbitrary multi - qubit states  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a recent experiment  @xcite has realized a @xmath0 state of eight qubits , encoded in the internal ionic levels , by performing a sequence of two - qubit gates on different ion pairs .",
    "however , given a set of available interactions in a physical system , there are particular families of entangled states that could be built globally and in fewer steps  @xcite . in the context of cavity qed ( cqed ) , for example , the coupling of a single cavity mode with a two - level atom , the jaynes - cummings model ( jc ) , can be extended to the @xmath1 atom case , leading to the tavis - cummings model , with different dynamics and entanglement features  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we study methods of generating specific classes of multi - qubit entangled states in trapped ions with collective interactions , which are potentially faster and more efficient than individual techniques .",
    "they consist of two key ingredients : firstly , the use of global rather than individual addressing of ions and , secondly , the presence of _ invariant subspaces _ , i.e. , combined ( vibronic ) internal and motional finite subspaces that are _ closed _ with respect to certain dynamical operations .    in sec .",
    "[ collmaps ] , we describe realistic collective vibronic interactions coupling the internal degrees of freedom of @xmath1 ions with a collective motional mode . specifically , we consider the blue and red excitation versions of the tavis - cummings model , taking distance from usual predictions in the dicke model . in sec .  [ invsub ]",
    ", we study the invariant subspaces , associated with the proposed interactions , in the search of classes of multipartite entangled states that may be efficiently generated .",
    "it will turn out that one of them is the family of symmetric dicke states  @xcite , from which the @xmath0 state is just a one - excitation particular case . in sec .",
    "[ deterministic ] , we consider the family of entangled states that could be generated by means of purely unitary global operations and , in sec .",
    "[ postselected ] , the ones that could be generated by using postselection .",
    "let us consider @xmath1 ions in a linear paul trap , cooled down to their collective motional ground state .",
    "we will not concentrate on a specific experimental setup  @xcite , and our derivations could be applied to any ion - trap device .",
    "the free - energy hamiltonian , @xmath2 , describing the @xmath1 two - level ions and their motion around their equilibrium positions is @xmath3 here , @xmath4 are @xmath5-components of pauli spin vectors describing the two - levels with energy gap @xmath6 , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the annihilation and creation operators for the normal modes with frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the interaction between the internal degrees of freedom of each ion and a collective motional mode can be induced by laser light of frequency @xmath10 , yielding  @xcite @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the coupling strength between the laser and the @xmath13-th ion , @xmath14 are @xmath15-components of pauli vectors , @xmath16 is the laser wave vector , @xmath17 is the displacement operator with respect to the equilibrium position , and @xmath18 is the phase of the laser at the location of the @xmath13-th ion",
    ".    we will study the case of homogeneous laser excitation , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and of near resonant coupling , @xmath21 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will also consider all @xmath22 , although this may play an important role when making experimental considerations . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian in the interaction picture , after a rotating - wave - approximation rwa ) with respect to the two internal levels , reads  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 denote the amplitudes of the @xmath25-th normal mode of the ion chain in the position expansions , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the ion mass . in the lamb - dicke limit , where all lamb - dicke parameters @xmath28 are small ,",
    "the exponential can be expanded and set for a rwa with respect to the phonon field . in that case , when the laser frequency is tuned to a particular collective motional sideband frequency , @xmath29 , we obtain blue and red sideband transition hamiltonians @xmath30 where @xmath31 . the interaction of eq .  ( [ falsered ] ) appears naturally in the context of cqed , where a bunch of atoms interact inhomogeneously with a cavity mode and the counter - rotating terms are neglected in the rwa .",
    "the dynamics in eq .",
    "( [ falseblue ] ) is not usual in cqed but can be easily engineered in trapped ions .",
    "only when @xmath9 corresponds to the center - of - mass ( com ) mode frequency @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 , and we can define the collective angular momentum operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in that case , we could rewrite the hamiltonians of eqs .",
    "( [ falseblue ] ) and ( [ falsered ] ) as @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the dynamics associated with the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ red ] ) is named after tavis and cummings  @xcite , who developed the first analytical solutions for this model . when we consider a motional mode different from the center - of - mass one",
    ", we could always define @xmath38 and @xmath39 , but these operators do not satisfy the usual angular momentum algebra .",
    "if we define @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , we get @xmath43 in fact , @xmath44 can still be used to lower and raise the quantum numbers of @xmath45 , but they do not commute with @xmath46 . for the case of the center - of - mass mode , where all commutations relations are satisfied , we shall denote the eigenstates of @xmath47 and @xmath45 by @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "states @xmath48 are known as the dicke states  @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath52 conserves the total number of spin and phonon excitations , and commutes with the excitation number operator @xmath53 , while hamiltonian @xmath54 conserves the difference between the spin and phonon excitations , hence , it commutes with @xmath55 .",
    "it is therefore possible to consider vibronic subspaces with a fixed number of excitations associated with @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "if we concentrate on the case @xmath58 , we have the eigenstates @xmath59 of @xmath56 , where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 denotes other degeneracy lifting quantum numbers .",
    "we then obtain the block diagonal structure @xmath62 .",
    "the dynamical evolution that is generated by @xmath52 leaves the subspaces invariant .",
    "we proceed to discuss certain examples of such invariant subspaces , for example , the one associated with the case @xmath63 .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath56 , @xmath64 , corresponds to the state @xmath65 , i.e. , all atoms in their ground state and no phonons in the system . for the case @xmath66",
    ", we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 the quantum number @xmath70 , lifts the @xmath71-fold degeneracy of the states with @xmath72 .",
    "hence , values of @xmath61 enumerate the different angular momentum multiplets .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath73 does not mix the different multiplets and , since @xmath74 , there are no further transitions .",
    "this does not follow merely from the conservation of @xmath56 , which does not forbid transition between the state @xmath75 , which has terms with one excited atom , and a state with one excited phonon .",
    "this non - mixing property of the multiplets reflects the effect of quantum _ irradiance _",
    "the construction of higher r - number subspaces is straightforward .",
    "for instance , for @xmath76 we shall have @xmath77 , etc .",
    "a key point in the present work is the use of subspaces which are bidimensional . in this simple case",
    ", the evolution of the system resembles that of the well known rabi oscillations .",
    "for example , let us consider the @xmath66 invariant subspace @xmath78 .",
    "we can start with the non - entangled state containing one phonon and with all the internal spins in their ground states .",
    "when we turn on the hamiltonian @xmath73 we obtain an oscillation between the states @xmath79 state @xmath80 is a symmetric combination of @xmath1 terms , @xmath81 , known as the w state .",
    "similarly , we could make use of the invariant space @xmath82 and , in that case , we would have the following oscillation @xmath83 in the general case , the invariant subspaces can be of higher dimension , for instance if we start with @xmath13 phonons in the multiplet @xmath84 , the relevant states for @xmath85 becomes , up to rotations induced by @xmath86 , @xmath87    so far , we have discussed invariant subspaces which are connected with the dicke states and the collective angular momentum operators with @xmath63 . by tuning the laser to couple other motional collective modes , we can access other @xmath25 subspaces . as we discuss in the next section ,",
    "it is sometimes helpful to combine several steps , and in each step to couple a different phonon normal mode .",
    "for instance , we can start with the state that contains two different phonon excitations @xmath88 couple first the internal levels with the phonon in mode @xmath89 and later with the phonon in mode @xmath25 .",
    "this process connects us with the state @xmath90 .",
    "it is useful to see that in this type of transitions we have @xmath91 where in the last step we used the orthogonality of the normal modes .",
    "with the use of @xmath86 , many relevant states can be created .",
    "we start with the state @xmath92 where the @xmath25-th mode is occupied by a single phonon , and the internal state is not entangled .",
    "a w - state @xmath93-pulse on the state of eq .",
    "( [ state ] ) . this can be easily understood by recalling that the above initial state belongs to the bidimensional hilbert space , latexmath:[${\\cal h}_{r=1,l = n/2}=\\lbrace    principle , by precise control of the duration and intensity of the laser pulse , a @xmath0 state can be created between a large number of ions .",
    "in fact , a @xmath0-state shared by eight ions has been created recently using a multi - step sequential procedure based on individual ionic addressing  @xcite . in the present proposal",
    ", we would require the previous preparation of a single phonon in the com mode and the application of a single homogeneous global laser pulse .",
    "a related scheme in the context of quantum dots was discussed recently by taylor _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to generate deterministically higher - excitation dicke states using other bidimensional invariant subspaces .",
    "the @xmath76 subspace @xmath95 is a two - dimensional space that is spanned by the states @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the first state above is equivalent , up to local operations , to the @xmath98 , while the second state , contains terms with two excited atoms and is equivalent , up to local transformations , to the second dicke state @xmath99 .",
    "the construction of @xmath100 can therefore proceed as follows .",
    "we first obtain as described above @xmath101 , using a single pulse . in the second step ,",
    "we transform @xmath102 by changing locally the phases of each ion .",
    "this step requires local addressing implementing local rotations . in the final step ,",
    "we add a single phonon and apply again @xmath73 to obtain @xmath100 , the second member of the subspace @xmath76 .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that for higher - excitation dicke states ,",
    "e.g. @xmath103 , this `` climbing the ladder '' method requires also some interaction between the qubits . to overcome this difficulty we shall discuss other methods .",
    "we consider next extended examples of coupling to other modes and show that they can be used for generating _ irradiant states _  @xcite .",
    "we start with the state @xmath104 involving one phonon in the @xmath25-th mode and all the internal levels in their ground state , then , we apply the hamiltonian @xmath105 .",
    "the conservation of @xmath56 restricts the possible evolution to the subspace of states with @xmath66 , i.e. , to the states @xmath106 and @xmath107 , with @xmath108 .",
    "however , we notice from eq .",
    "( [ lplm ] ) that only terms with @xmath109 do not vanish , hence , the evolution leads to rabi oscillations in the bidimensional hilbert space @xmath110 . in this way",
    ", we can generate the family of entangled irradiant states of the form @xmath111 irradiant states are states that do not emit photons and are thus more robust to decoherence than radiant states . in our case , this property is due to the relation in eq .",
    "( [ lplm ] ) .",
    "since the coupling to the electromagnetic field is through the @xmath112 operators , as it is for the phonon field , the resultant states are irradiant @xcite .",
    "for the the case of two spins , the resulting state is the epr state .",
    "the experimental feasibility of irradiance and superradiance in ion traps was discussed and demonstrated by de voe and brewer  @xcite .",
    "having produced certain irradiant states , we can use them as a starting point for the deterministic generation of an additional class of states .",
    "irradiant states introduce other bidimensional invariant subspaces .",
    "since @xmath113 , the subspace @xmath114 is an invariant subspace of hamiltonian @xmath86 and , therefore , the second state can be produced by rabi flipping .",
    "this is a new kind of entangled state which is a superposition of states with two spins in the upper state , @xmath115 for the case of four spins the outcome of this process is a ghz state .",
    "first , we apply @xmath116 , which couples the internal states with the higher collective mode , @xmath117 , and create the irradiant state @xmath118 in the next stage , we apply the @xmath119 red hamiltonian and get @xmath120 which is , up to a local operation , a ghz state .",
    "in the previous section , we have discussed deterministic schemes for producing irradiant states as well as the lowest dicke states ( including the @xmath0 state ) .",
    "however , the full family of dicke states could not be generated using only collective unitary transformations . in the present section ,",
    "we present another approach which is useful for producing the full set of dicke states @xmath121 the properties of the dicke states may be of considerable interest in quantum information , and have been discussed recently by different authors  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the von neumann entanglement entropy , with respect to a bi - partite split of @xmath1 qubits in a dicke state , increases with @xmath16 and saturates gradually for large @xmath16 values .",
    "the behavior of the ( mixed state ) entanglement between two qubits @xcite can be evaluated by considering , for example , the negativity which increases , almost linearly with @xmath16 .",
    "the basic idea behind our approach is that while a collective unitary transformation can not be used to create any dicke state , a suitable choice of the initial phonon state can bring us very close to our goal . in this scheme ,",
    "however , there will be always a small error due to mixing with other states .",
    "therefore , unlike the previous examples , we propose to postselect the phonon state in order to be certain that the desired dicke state was produced .    in order to create the dicke state @xmath122 ,",
    "we begin by preparing the initial state @xmath123 .",
    "we then apply the time evolution of the hamiltonian @xmath52 , which takes this state into the @xmath124 invariant subspace .",
    "it turns out that at a certain time the probability distribution will be sharply peaked around a state with zero phonons and @xmath122 for the internal levels . by measuring the number of the phonons it is then possible to remove the admixture of @xmath125 with other states",
    "a procedure to create and measure the number operator in an ion trap was introduced by different authors  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , motional fock states were already produced in the lab  @xcite , although those techniques required a series of consecutive rabi flips .",
    "the crucial ingredient in our proposed mechanism is that the purity of the state , prior to postselection , is high .",
    "the fact that the state containing zero phonons in eq .",
    "( 10 ) is produced with high probability is shown numerically below .",
    "the intuition behind this is that there is an analogy between these subspaces and the angular momentum subspaces of @xmath126 , though the commutation relations are different .",
    "the @xmath127 operator rotates the spin about the @xmath15 axis , producing states with @xmath128 with a probability one . in order to model this dynamics an analogy",
    "could be made between this dynamics in hilbert space and the dynamics of a particle travelling between sites with different coupling strength .",
    "since the couplings are higher at the middle and lower at the edges , the probabilities are maximal at the edges , see figs .",
    "[ pop ] and  [ entropy ] .",
    "we therefore expect the hamiltonian @xmath86 to rotate the state between the first and last state in eq .",
    "( [ sub ] ) with a probability close to unity .",
    "we make now some further considerations concerning our scheme based on postselection .",
    "the only states which are created with high probability are @xmath129 , where @xmath27 is the number of phonons .",
    "this is due to the fact that the last state is created with high probability , therefore , the number of phonons in the first state determines the final state .",
    "the population of states in the subspace of eq .",
    "( [ sub ] ) starting with @xmath130 are shown in fig .",
    "[ pop22 ] , where we observe that for specific times the desired state is obtained with high probability . a similar thing",
    "is observed in fig .",
    "[ pop55 ] starting with @xmath131 . in spite of the fact that the number of excitations is not negligible compared to the number of spins , the purity of the final state is considerably high .",
    "this observation may prove very useful for generating @xmath125 states .    ,",
    "@xmath132 , @xmath133 as a function of time.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to increase the purity of the final state the number of phonons has to be measured and the vacuum state postselected . to achieve that goal",
    ", we consider a recently proposed technique  @xcite for sorting a desired motional fock state @xmath134 out of any motional distribution .",
    "this technique is based on a suitably designed vibronic scheme in a single ion , allowing for a restricted dynamics inside a chosen selected jc subspace @xmath135 . to adapt it to our present work",
    ", we would need an additional idle ion inside the chain , coupled to the motional mode of interest and specifically assigned to postselection purposes . together with the additional necessity of individual ion addressing for the sake of manipulation and measurement , these requirements for the idle ion are at reach by the state - of - the - art present technology in trapped ions  @xcite .    .",
    "the first state is a state with 10 spins down and 5 phonons , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the proposed scheme described hitherto can also be applied to create motional number states via the hamiltonian @xmath136 , which will rotate the state in the proper subspace . postselecting",
    "the spin state will yield the fock state state @xmath134 and the number of spins measured up would indicate the number of motional excitations @xmath1 .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented methods of producing entangled states using homogenous global laser coupling in trapped ion systems . we have considered two schemes , one based on purely ( deterministic ) unitary operations and the other one based on an ulterior ( probabilistic ) postselection .",
    "both schemes use the fact that the tavis - cummings model , in its blue- and red - excitation versions , possesses invariant subspaces . in the deterministic case ,",
    "the global laser pulses produce the desired entangled states after rotations in the associated bidimensional invariant subspaces .",
    "in the probabilistic case , the allowed rotations produce edge states that are very close to the desired entangled states , requiring a highly efficient postselection technique .",
    "we believe that all proposed schemes are realistic and at within reach using present state - of - the - art technology in trapped ions .",
