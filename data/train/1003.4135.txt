    "this paper is one of a series aimed at finding and characterizing luminous asymptotic giant branch variables within local group galaxies ; it follows similar work on phoenix and fornax ( menzies et al .",

    "menzies et al .",
    "( 2002 hereafter paper  i ) reported the discovery of several dust - enshrouded agb stars in leo  i. here we discuss multi - epoch @xmath3 photometry of those stars which enables us to characterise them .",
    "the large - amplitude , or mira , variables are of particular interest , first , because they tell us about the intermediate age population of which they are the most luminous representatives , secondly because they provide an independent distance calibration , via the period - luminosity ( pl ) relation ( whitelock et al .",
    "2008 ) , and thirdly because they will be major contributors to the processed material currently entering the interstellar medium of leo  i and are therefore an important source of enrichment .",
    "leo  i is one of the most distant of the local group galaxies associated with the milky way .",
    "it has a complex star formation history ( gallart et al .",
    "1999 ; hernandez et al .",
    "2000 ; dolphin 2002 ) with evidence for star formation over much of its lifetime .",
    "the most recent episode occurred about 1gyr ago and may have been the result of leo  i s interaction with the milky way ( mateo , olszewski & walker 2008 ) .",
    "most published work indicates little evidence for population gradients ( e.g. koch et al .",
    ". however , mateo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find that the agb stars are almost exclusively located within a radius of 400 arcsec whereas giant branch ( gb ) stars have a more extended distribution .",
    "the analysis of infrared photometry by held et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also indicates a strong radial gradient in the intermediate - age populations and supports the findings by mateo et al .",

    "note , however , salaris & girardi ( 2005 ) have urged caution in using the trgb as a distance indicator in the presence of a significant intermediate mass population  a situation that obviously applies to leo  i.    each method of distance determination has its own uncertainties , and although touched upon here the details of these are beyond the scope of this paper . within those uncertainties",

    "2008 ) and we would therefore suggest that the longest period mira in leo  i , l1064 with p=523 days , is of similar age .",
    "the other miras must be older ; how much older is difficult to quantify . in view of the fact that two of the stars with @xmath46 days are found in the outer part of leo  i ( section 4.4 )",
    "it is tempting to suggest that they may be much older , possibly comparable to the 10 gyr or more that is thought to be characteristic of the rgb stars .",
    "note that in the galaxy oxygen - rich miras with @xmath46 days are found in relatively metal - rich ( @xmath47>-1 $ ] ) globular clusters , which have ages greater than 10gyr . within these clusters , their periods and therefore of course their magnitudes are proportional to the metallicity of the parent cluster ( feast , whitelock & menzies 2002 ) .",
    "miras are not found in the more metal - deficient clusters .",
    "although we have yet to confirm spectroscopically that these two miras are carbon - rich , their colours certainly suggest it .",
    "most models do not produce carbon stars or high - mass - loss objects at ages of 10 gyr , although recent work suggests it might happen .",
    "karakas ( 2010 ) modelled a @xmath48 star with z=0.0001 and found that it experienced 26 thermal pulses and a small amount of third - dredge - up . in an envelope with such a low metallicity ,",
    "even a small amount of dredge - up was enough to make @xmath49 and produce a carbon star .",
    "this is clearly an area where more work is needed and these stars are worth a more detailed investigation .    for the future , with the next generation of large telescopes working in the infrared",
    ", mira variables will prove vital distance indicators for studying populations of old and intermediate age stars , where they will be amongst the most luminous objects , easily identified via their large amplitude variations .",
