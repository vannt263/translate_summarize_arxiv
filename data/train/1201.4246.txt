    "the kolmogorov - johnson - mehl - avrami ( kjma ) model finds application in a vast ambit of scientific fields which ranges from thin film growth to materials science to biology and pharmacology , let alone the applied probability theory . in the majority of these studies",
    "the authors made use of a simplified version of the kjma formula : the stretched exponential @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fraction of the transformed phase , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( the latter known as avrami s exponent ) being constants .",
    "the model , in principle , is simple because it rests on a poissonian stochastic process of points in space , to which a growth law is attached .",
    "in fact , owing to the poissonian process , the nucleation takes place everywhere in the space i.e. also in the already transformed phase . this partially fictitious nucleation rate ( @xmath4 ) , for we are dealing with a poissonian process , is linked to the actual ( real ) nucleation rate ( @xmath5 ) according to : @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 is the transformed fraction .",
    "the growth law transforms each point in a nucleus of radius @xmath8 , @xmath9 stands for time .",
    "the pair , `` points generation '' and `` growth law '' , is a key quantity of the theory .",
    "it happens that the kjma model fails for time - dependent points generation rate ( i.e. nucleation rate ) associated with diffusional - type growth laws @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in particular , let us define two classes of growth laws : i ) @xmath10 and ii ) @xmath11 .",
    "the kjma model is suitable for describing the first class of growths and for this reason we named it kjma - compliant as opposite to the second to which we attach the adjective kjma - non - compliant .",
    "the reason for that is due to the particular stochastic process taken into account . as a matter of fact",
    ", the poissonian process requires that points can be generated everywhere throughout the space independently of whether the space is , because of growth , already transformed or not .",
    "points generated in the already transformed space are named phantoms after avrami .",
    "it goes without saying that , in the case of kjma - compliant growths , phantoms do not contribute to the true transformed fraction , i.e. they are just virtual points whose only role is to simplify the mathematics @xcite . on the other hand , in the kjma - non - compliant growths phantoms",
    "may contribute to the phase transition through the non - physical `` overgrowth '' events @xcite .",
    "incidentally , it is worth noticing that the kjma - non - compliant growths and kjma - compliant growths are indistinguishable if associated with simultaneous nucleation @xcite .    according to what has been said ,",
    "one can summarize saying that the concept of phantom implies the existence of the two classes of growths .",
    "one has to bring in mind that the above stretched exponential expression ( @xmath0 ) is the exact solution of the kinetics only in the case @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the nucleation rate and @xmath15 dirac s delta function , provided the growth is according to a power law . in general , the term @xmath16 is a simple way to approximate the convolution product between the nucleation rate ( phantom included ) and the nucleus volume .",
    "this convolution is the `` extended '' transformed fraction and takes into account the contribution of phantoms , @xmath17 . in view of the large use of the kjma theory for dealing with experimental data",
    ", it should be desirable to make use of an extended transformed fraction deprived of phantom contribution , @xmath18 .",
    "a pictorial view of the geometrical meaning of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath1 is reported in fig.1 .    ) and actual ( @xmath18 ) extended fractions are also reported .",
    "the ( extended ) volume of the i - th nucleus is denoted as @xmath19 and the transformed fraction as @xmath1 . ]",
    "the aim of this contribution is twofold : i ) to model the phase transformation kinetics in terms of actual quantities such as the nucleation rate ; ii ) to provide an expression for the transformed fraction as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "in this section we discuss the stochastic theory that has to be employed in order to get rid of phantoms in modeling the kinetics of phase transformations ruled by nucleation and growth . to this end , let us define the phantom included nucleation rate @xmath4 , and the `` actual '' nucleation rate , @xmath5 , namely the rate of birth of the `` real '' nuclei ; @xmath5 is the quantity experimentally accessible .",
    "it goes without saying that a mathematical formulation of the phase transition kinetics which employs the `` actual '' nucleation rate holds true for both kjma - compliant and kjma - non - compliant growth laws .",
    "this automatically overcomes the limit of the kjma approach . however , actual nuclei imply a severe complication of the stochastic - nature of the process under study , for we shift from a poissonian to a non - poissonian process : in fact actual nuclei are spatially correlated",
    ". let us address this point in more detail by denoting with @xmath20 the radius of a nucleus , at running time @xmath9 , which starts growing at time @xmath21 . to be an actual nucleus it has to lie at a distance @xmath22 from any other `` older '' nucleus with @xmath23 .",
    "in other words , in the spirit of the statistical mechanics of hard spheres , this condition is formalized ( at the lowest order ) through the pair distribution function for the `` pair of nuclei ( @xmath24 ) '' at relative distance @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the heavyside function . throughout the paper",
    "we employ the notation by van kampen @xcite according to which @xmath28dots distribution and correlation functions are denoted as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .    in previous papers ,",
    "we have presented a theory for describing phase transitions in the case of spatially correlated nuclei and for time dependent nucleation rate .",
    "the untransformed fraction can be expressed in terms of either the distribution functions , ( @xmath29-functions ) , or the correlation functions , ( @xmath30-functions ) , where the @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s are linked by cluster expansion @xcite .",
    "given a generic point of space we have computed the probability that this point is not covered ( transformed ) by any nucleus up to time @xmath9 .",
    "this probability is the fraction of untransformed phase i.e. @xmath31 . by denoting with @xmath32 the volume of a nucleus , which starts growing at time @xmath21 , at running time @xmath9 , and in the case of symmetric @xmath29 and @xmath30 functions ,",
    "the uncovered fraction is given by    @xmath33    or , @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is worth pointing out that the nucleation rates entering these equations are in fact subjected to the condition imposed by the correlation among nuclei .",
    "this quantity may or may not imply phantoms depending on the specific form of the @xmath29 functions .",
    "for this reason we introduce the new symbol @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , for the hard core correlation ( eqn.[f1 ] ) @xmath35 coincides with the actual nucleation rate , @xmath36 , which leads to the solution of the phase transition kinetics in terms of the actual nucleation rate .    since eqn.[uncov1],[uncov2 ] are the exact solutions of the stochastic process linked to the phase transition",
    ", they also coincide with the kjma formula provided the above mentioned preconditions are met i.e. random nucleation and kjma - compliant growth .    as far as the hard - core correlation ( eqn.[f1 ] ) and the kinetics eqns.[uncov1],[uncov2 ] are concerned , we note that the number of nuclei of size @xmath37 is @xmath38 . as a consequence and in the framework of the statistical mechanics of hard sphere fluid , we are dealing with an extremely dilute solution of pairs of components @xmath39 .",
    "accordingly , the number density of @xmath40 spheres being of the order of @xmath41 , higher order terms in the cluster expansion of the @xmath42 function can be neglected , thus @xmath43 in eqn.[uncov1 ] .      in this section",
    "we show that eqn.[uncov1 ] is compatible with the kjma kinetics only in the case of kjma - compliant function . on the other hand , such a comparison will give a deeper insight into the reasons why the kjma kinetics does not work in the case of `` kjma - non - compliant '' functions .",
    "in the following , we discuss the linear growth law for 2d case .",
    "also , to simplify the complexity of the computation the `` actual '' nucleation rate , @xmath44 , is taken as constant ; as a consequence the phantom included nucleation rate reads @xmath45 and the kjma kinetics becomes    @xmath46,\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a constant .",
    "we consider the series expansion of @xmath49 around @xmath50 .",
    "one gets ,    @xmath51    where @xmath52 .    moreover ,",
    "since @xmath53 , being @xmath54 and @xmath55 , from eqn.[serie1 ] it is found that only the terms @xmath56 are different from zero , i.e. @xmath57 . in particular ,",
    "the first coefficients are : @xmath58 .",
    "next we derive the series expansion of the untransformed fraction @xmath59 , by exploiting the condition @xmath60 . even in this case",
    "the @xmath61 coefficients are different from zero for @xmath62 ( with integer @xmath63 ) .",
    "the first four coefficients are    @xmath64    by using the expression of @xmath65 s the series of the untransformed fraction up to @xmath66 is given as    @xmath67    since @xmath68 the series eqn.[serie2 ] can be rewritten as    @xmath69    the two last coefficients being @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we emphasize that the coefficients of this series only depend upon growth law , for constant @xmath44 ( see also the last section ) .",
    "the next step is to show that the untransformed fraction , given by the series eqn.[uncov1 ] is equal to eqn.[serie2 ] or eqn.[serie3 ] .",
    "we have carried out the first two terms , exactly , while , owing to the tremendous computational complexity , for the third term an approximation has been employed .",
    "it is worth reminding that the distribution functions are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the relative distance .",
