    "since the turn of the century , the field of complex networks has been one of the most active areas of statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "one of the central questions is to find quantities for measuring network structure ( how a network differs from a random graph ) .",
    "the basic assumption is that the network structure is related to the function of the network .",
    "thus , by measuring network structural quantities , one can say something both about the forces that created the network , and about how dynamic systems on the network behave .",
    "one important concept in many areas of physics ( particle physics , condensed matter physics and more  @xcite ) is symmetry  invariance to particular operators . our approach is to presuppose that symmetry can be useful to study complex networks , then we try to construct a sensible and general framework for measuring symmetry in networks .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we define a measure for degree - symmetries in networks  a degree - symmetry coefficient .",
    "this is a local , vertex - specific measure , i.e.  it includes only information from a bounded surrounding of the vertex .",
    "the fundamental operator in this definition of degree - symmetry is permutations of paths of length @xmath0 leading out from a vertex @xmath1 .",
    "if the degree sequences of paths of length @xmath0 from @xmath1 overlap to a great extent , then we say @xmath1 is a center of degree - symmetry .",
    "in other words ; if , regardless of which path we take out from @xmath1 , we see the same sequence of degrees , then @xmath1 is highly degree - symmetric .",
    "if one replaces degree , in this definition , by some other vertex - specific quantity , one gets a general framework for analyzing local symmetry  instead of degree symmetries , one can talk about clustering symmetries , betweenness symmetries or symmetries with respect to any other ( network related or external ) vertex specific quantity .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ill ] . ) in this paper we will discuss such extensions of degree - symmetry coefficient .",
    "as one example we study functional symmetries in networks of proteins .",
    "we consider a network modeled by an unweighted and undirected graph of @xmath2 vertices , @xmath3 ; and @xmath4 edges , @xmath5 .",
    "we assume the graph have no multiple edges or self - edges .",
    "let @xmath6 be a vertex trait or structural quantity  for example : degree , betweenness centrality  @xcite or a protein function .",
    "consider a vertex @xmath1 and the paths of length @xmath0 leading out from this vertex .",
    "these paths can be thought of as the look of the network from the vantage point @xmath1 .",
    "the cut - off length @xmath0 reflects that the influence of the network @xmath1 on @xmath1 s function decreases with distance . in principle",
    "one can use any decaying function to lower the weight of distant vertices .",
    "we chose the simplest functional form ( at least the easiest to implement)a step function weighing vertices at a distance @xmath0 , or less , from @xmath1 equal ( while yet more distant vertices are not considered at all ) . in the numerical examples",
    ", we will choose the shortest non - trivial value , @xmath7 .",
    "the sequences of @xmath6-values along these paths are the input to the symmetry measure .",
    "we denote such sequences : @xmath8,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\vdots\\\\   & & , [ x(v^1_{p , i , l}),\\cdots , x(v^l_{p , i , l})]\\big\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the @xmath10th vertex along the @xmath11th path of length @xmath0 leading out from @xmath1",
    ". then let @xmath12 be a function measuring the similarity of two @xmath13-values ( for integer valued @xmath13-functions , one example of an @xmath14-function is kronecker s delta ) .",
    "a first attempt to construct a symmetry measure is to sum @xmath15 for vertex pairs at the same distance from @xmath1 in @xmath16 , i.e.@xmath17 where @xmath18 this measure has many statistical discrepancies .",
    "for example , all paths that go via a particular neighbor of @xmath1 contribute to the sum . in practice",
    "this means that vertices with a high degree vertex @xmath19 at a distance close to @xmath0 will ( by virtue of the many paths that overlap up to @xmath19 ) trivially have a high @xmath20 . to get around this problem",
    "we omit path segments at indices lower than @xmath19 in @xmath16 ( for details , see ref .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the number of such terms ( a way to calculate @xmath21 is given in ref .",
    "then a measure compensating for terms from path with the same beginnings is given by : @xmath22 the degree sequence is often considered an inherent property of the system .",
    "structure should , in such cases , be defined relative to a null - model of random graphs conditioned to the same degree distribution as the network . a measure where zero denotes neutrality",
    "can be constructed as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes average over an ensemble of random graphs with the same set of degrees as the original network .",
    "a way to sample such null - model graphs is to randomly rewire the edges of the original network ( at every time step keeping the vertices degrees are conserved ) .",
    "note that , for such rewiring procedures , there are many sample - technical considerations needed to achieve ergodicity and statistical independence .",
    "we use the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and 1000 sample averages .",
    "if the @xmath13-function only depends on the network , one can recalculate it for each individual realization of the null - model .",
    "if the information behind @xmath6 is external , then one has to let the trait be associated with @xmath1 throughout the randomization process , or randomly distribute the traits among the vertices .",
    "the former situation is suitable if the trait has some connection to the degree , the latter ( that we use in this paper ) is more appropriate if there are no such connections .    to apply the framework described above one has to specify a function @xmath13 mapping @xmath3 to integer or real numbers .",
    "furthermore one has to chose an @xmath14-function indicating if two vertices are considered similar or not . in this paper",
    "we discuss binary valued @xmath14-functions ( @xmath25 if @xmath1 and @xmath10 are considered similar , @xmath26 otherwise ) , but one can also think of real valued @xmath14-functions where a high value means a high similarity between the two arguments .",
    "one of the most successful applications of complex network analysis is studies of large - scale microbiological networks .",
    "such studies can be performed at different levels of the cellular organization  from genetic regulation  @xcite , via protein interactions  @xcite , to biochemical networks  @xcite .",
    "we will use protein interaction networks as our example . in protein interaction networks",
    "the vertices are typically an entire proteome ( i.e.  all proteins in an organism ) .",
    "the edges represent pairs of proteins than can bind physically to each other .",
    "it is important to note that at only a small fraction of the protein interactions is in effect at particular location in a particular cell . the biological information one can hope to get out from studying the protein interaction network is thus rather limited .",
    "dynamic properties of the cellular activity , i.e.  the functions of a particular cell , are beyond the reach of static network theory .",
    "the study of the protein interaction network , in this paper , serves more as an example of symmetry analyzes , than an advance in proteomics .",
    "if symmetry has some relation to the protein functions , like degree is correlated with lethality  @xcite , one can use the symmetry coefficient for functional classification or prediction .",
    "the particular protein interaction data we use ( from the yeast _ s.  cerevisiae _ ) was taken from mips  @xcite january 23 , 2005 ( the same data set as used in ref .",
    "the network has @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "mips also provide functional classification of the proteins  @xcite .",
    "this is a hierarchical classification where , for example , the top - level category `` metabolism '' is subdivided into e.g.  `` amino acid metabolism , '' and so on .",
    "one protein can be assigned none , one or many functional categories ; so , to make a symmetry measure out of this information , let @xmath6 be the set of top - level functions of @xmath1 , and let @xmath29 we choose this @xmath14-function because it is the simplest .",
    "for a more thorough investigation of protein interaction symmetries one might consider other functions , like the real valued jaccard - index .",
    "apart from the functional symmetry coefficient we will also measure the degree - symmetry coefficient as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath6 is the degree , or number of neighbors , of @xmath1 . for highly skewed degree distributions , as protein interaction networks",
    "are known to have  @xcite , it is appropriate to use : @xmath30 we use @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ykr010c](a ) we give an example of a protein with high degree symmetry , ykr010c . since its neighbors are all equal ( i.e.  all pairs of neighbors @xmath33 have @xmath34 ) this is not surprising .",
    "even many second - neighbors are equivalent in this respect ( such as ylr377c , ynl113w and ynl099c ) .",
    "[ fig : ykr010c](b ) shows the functional overlap in the same subgraph .",
    "although the overlapping vertex pairs are rather few , ykr010c has a positive functional symmetry coefficient ( rather weak , however , with a p - value of around five percent ) .",
    "the main reason for this is that similar vertices are very rare due to the quite strict definition of similarity ( eq .  [ eq : proteinf ] ) .",
    "[ fig : ygl250w](a ) shows a protein , ygl250w , with a negative degree - symmetry coefficient .",
    "the visual impression of skewness of ygl250w s two - neighborhood is , we believe , another aspect of this degree - asymmetry .",
    "in contrast , the functional symmetry coefficient of ygl250w vertex is large .",
    "as noted above , due to the many possible sets of functions ( 675 in total ) functionally overlapping pairs are quite rare ; yet in this example there are seven sets of overlapping pairs , or triplets at the same distance from ygl250w which explains the high functional symmetry .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a general framework for measuring symmetries of the surrounding of a vertex .",
    "the basic idea is that observational processes often take the form of walks ; in other words , that the symmetry means that the network looks the same along many paths leading out from a vertex .",
    "this leads us to the principle that if the set of paths of a limited length @xmath0 out from a vertex @xmath1 is invariant to permutations , then @xmath1 is a local center of symmetry .",
    "we exemplify this framework , and the derived symmetry coefficient , by studying the protein interaction network of _",
    "s. cerevisiae_. for this network databases catalog traits of the vertices , which allow two fundamentally different symmetries to be measured : the degree symmetry ( where the similarity is related to the network structure ) and functional symmetry ( where the similarity stems from external information ) .",
    "these two coefficients are exemplified by two proteins in very different symmetry configurations ( one with high degree symmetry and weakly positive functional symmetry , another with degree asymmetry and very high functional symmetry ) .",
    "we do not attempt to deduce the biological meaning of the symmetry coefficients .",
    "but we can conceive that symmetry and biological function are related from the presence of `` network - motifs ''  @xcite in biological networks .",
    "network motifs are small , statistically overrepresented subgraphs with , presumably , specific functions .",
    "if one vertex controls , or is controlled by , several such motifs , then it would have high ( degree , functional or other ) symmetry coefficient . to conclude , we believe symmetries can be a useful concept for analyzing complex networks .",
    "there are , furthermore , many ways to extend this work to other measures and applications .",
