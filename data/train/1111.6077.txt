    "understanding and controlling the structure - size dependence of the chemical activity in materials with reduced dimensionality is a longstanding target of surface science , whose practical significance stems from potential applications in catalysis , gas sensing , and anticorrosion .",
    "a recent exciting development in this area is the observation , in metal films a few atomic layers thick , of a correlation between quantum - size effects and properties such as chemisorption@xcite and surface oxidation.@xcite    danese _ et al._,@xcite in particular , have observed experimentally systematic oscillations in the desorption temperature of co adsorbates on ultrathin epitaxial cu(001 ) films on fcc - fe(001 ) , as a function of film thickness .",
    "such fe - supported films give rise experimentally to well resolved series of quantum - well states ( qwss).@xcite the largest co desorption temperatures were found to coincide with cu film thicknesses at which a qws crosses the fermi energy , @xmath1 , in inverse photo - emission ( ipe ) spectra taken at normal incidence.@xcite    typically , modifications in chemisorption properties of metal surfaces are achieved by monolayer or submonolayer deposition of a second metal , forming a surface alloy , and exploiting related local surface mechanisms such as site blocking or charge exchanges.@xcite using thin - film qws s instead is an interesting new approach to tailor surface chemisorption properties . in spite of its interest ,",
    "however , the precise mechanism and key parameter behind the qws - related modifications of the chemisorption properties are not yet fully understood .",
    "very recently , quantum - size effects have also been reported in the initial oxidation rate of ultrathin mg , al , and pb supported films.@xcite the effect was initially suggested to be due to periodic oscillations , with film thickness , in the magnitude of the density of states ( dos ) of the films at the fermi energy.@xcite the dos per atom of the film is a parameter which is often invoked in model reactivity theories,@xcite and which may account for the observed reactivity trends of the pb films@xcite  although other parameters have also been invoked.@xcite in the case of the mg films , however , it was observed later on that the actual variation in the dos per atom of the film at @xmath1 could not simply account for the order - of - magnitude change in the initial oxidation rate of the films.@xcite moreover , for the al films , significant differences were observed between the dos and reactivity trends as a function of film thickness.@xcite    in the cases of the mg and al films , for which the precursor adsorption mode of the o@xmath2 molecule on the surface should be physisorption , the key parameter responsible for the changes in the initial oxidation rate was then proposed to be the decay length in vacuum , @xmath3 , of the electronic local density of states of the film at the fermi energy.@xcite modifications in @xmath3 can be expected to have a direct exponential influence on the electron transfer rate by resonant tunneling , which is believed to control the initial sticking of the o@xmath2 molecules on such surfaces.@xcite the same argument , however , based on tunneling processes , does not hold in the case of co on cu(001 ) , where the molecule is clearly chemisorbed and the modulated value is the chemisorption energy . in this case , the key factor responsible for the observed changes is still an open issue .    in this work , we investigate by means of _ ab initio _ calculations , the correlation between the chemisorption energy of co molecules on cu(001 ) films and quantum - size effects . the observed systematic oscillations in the chemisorption energy can be understood in terms of periodic modifications , with film thickness , in the decay length of the qws s at the fermi level . the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",

    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",

    "we also elected to use the same frozen cu ( cu / fe ) slab geometry for the co covered and uncovered cu films , as our main purpose here is to understand the correlation between the co - cu(001 ) chemisorption energy and quantum - size effects , which are of electronic origin .",

[ dosef ] , we display the calculated dos per atom at @xmath1 of the free - standing cu(001 ) films , as a function of film thickness .",
    "the dos clearly displays short - period ( 2 to 3 ml ) oscillations , which neither follow the periodic crossing between the qws at @xmath43 and @xmath1 ( in fig .",

    "[ wfctus ] ) and of the chemisorption energy of the supported films ( fig.[ads1 ] ) , one observes that the local maxima in the chemisorption energy ( at 4 and 10 ml ) are shifted by -1 ml with respect to the minima in the work function ( at 5 and 11 ml ) , and that the local minimum of the chemisorption energy ( at 6 ml ) also does not correspond to the local maximum of the work function ( at 8 ml ) .",

    "[ lbda ] .    the effect of @xmath3 on the chemisorption energy may be understood in terms of an increased / decreased overlap , with increased / decreased @xmath3 , between the most extended qws s of the film ( on the vacuum side ) at @xmath1 and the frontier orbitals of the molecule,@xcite namely the co @xmath67 highest - occupied molecular orbitals ( homo ) and @xmath68 lowest - unoccupied molecular orbitals ( lumo ) .",

    "the latter interaction is expected to be the dominant one.@xcite    hence , for cu thicknesses larger than 4 ml , the trends we obtain in the chemisorption energy can be understood in terms of systematic changes in the decay length of the qws s at @xmath1 , which influence the interaction between filled / empty qws s of the film at @xmath71 and the lumo / homo of the molecule .",
    "we note that the calculated and experimental chemisorption energy display the same trend as a function of film thickness in the range 5 - 12 ml .",
    "the main differences occurs at 4 ml : while the experimental chemisorption energy decreases with decreasing thickness from 5 to 3 ml , the calculated value has a maximum at 4 ml . such a difference , however , can be expected for the thinnest films considered , namely 3 and 4 ml , as the behavior of their chemisorption energy sensitively depends on the substrate ( see fig .",
    "one may therefore also expect the details of the experimental interface ( e.g. , atomic intermixing at the interface ) to affect the chemisorption energy of these films .",
    "we note that in our calculations the maximum in the chemisorption energy does not occur exactly when a qws at @xmath43 crosses @xmath1 , but 1 ml before .",
    "we believe this is related to the fact that , in the calculations , the quantum - well subband with energy closest to @xmath1 at @xmath43 ( see fig . [ band10 ] ) barely touches the fermi level at 5 ml ( and 11 ml ) .",
    "in this situation , although the unoccupied qws s just above @xmath1 may interact with the @xmath67 of the molecule , the occupied qws at @xmath0 can not interact , by symmetry , with the co @xmath56 states .",
    "in fact , based on projections on the atomic states , we find that the qws s near @xmath1 at @xmath43 are composed mainly of cu 4@xmath72 states , with a small component of cu @xmath73 states ( about @xmath74 % for the @xmath43 qws s within 0.2 ev of the fermi level).@xcite in the region near the brillouin - zone center , a @xmath75 component , which can mix with the co(@xmath56 ) orbitals , appears in the qws s , near @xmath1 , when going outside @xmath45 , e.g. , along the @xmath76 direction .",

    "this corresponds to an optimal situation in which the highest occupied qws at @xmath45 is closest to , but not yet crossing @xmath1 . in our calculations",
    ", this situation corresponds to the 4- and 10- ml cases , which in fact yield maxima in the calculated chemisorption energy .",
    "we have performed first - principles calculations , based on dft , to study the modulations with film thickness in the chemisorption energy of co molecules on cu(001 ) films .",
    "we have examined fe - supported and free - standing cu(001 ) films with thicknesses in the range 3 - 12 ml .",
    "the presence of the substrate has an important influence on the chemsiorption energy for thicknesses of 4 ml and below .",
    "the calculated co chemisorption energy of the supported films displays systematic oscillations , as a function of film thickness , with a periodicity corresponding to that of quantum - well states at @xmath0 crossing the fermi energy .",
    "these oscillations in the chemisorption energy are understood in terms of periodic modulations of the decay length in vacuum of the quantum - well states at the fermi energy .",
    "these modulations of the decay length are expected to influence the interaction of the quantum - well states with the frontier orbitals of the molecule .",
    "contrary to previous suggestions , we find that the actual oscillations with film thickness of the density of states per atom of the films at the fermi energy can not account for the observed modulations of the chemisorption properties",

    "in addition to displaying the correct trend ( i.e. , a correlation with the chemisorption energy ) in the range 5 - 12 ml , the decay length is a much more robust parameter than the dos in terms of its energy dependence around the fermi energy . for a given film",
