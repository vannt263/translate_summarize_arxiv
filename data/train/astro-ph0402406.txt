    "the infrared space observatory was the second infrared space mission , providing a great improvement in sensitivity over the iras mission . the european large - area iso survey ( _ elais _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was the largest open time programme on iso .",
    "this project surveyed 12 square degrees , divided into four main fields , three in the north ( n1 , n2 , n3 ) and one in the south ( s1 ) .",
    "the main survey bands used were 6.7 , 15 , 90 and 170@xmath0 m .",
    "the isocam camera was used for the shorter wavelengths while the isophot camera was used for the longer ones .",
    "optical imaging is essential to study the properties of the sources detected . due to the large errors ellipses of the mid - ir detections , typically several seconds of arc ,",
    "it is necessary to carry out a detailed process of identification . since more than one optical source can be inside those ellipses , a method which provides the likelihood of each counterpart to be the true association",
    "is needed .",
    "the identification does not only provides us the optical properties of the mid - ir sources but also allows us to further proceed with followup observations of interesting sources .",
    "this paper presents the optical identification of the mid - ir and radio sources in the n1 and n2 areas .",
    "section  [ sec : wfs ] presents a summary of the optical observations carried out in these areas as well as the reduction steps and products .",
    "section  [ sec : elaiscat ] describes the mid - ir and radio catalogues used .",
    "section  [ sec : id ] discusses the actual procedure to determine the optical counterparts of the sources , while sections  [ sec : properties ] and  [ sec : properties2 ] describe the optical properties of the sources .",
    "in order to identify the mid - ir sources with optical objects we use the data from the wide field survey ( wfs , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this survey has been carried out using the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) on the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma ) .",
    "the wfc is formed by 4 4k@xmath52k ccds .",
    "the arrays have 13.5@xmath0mpixels corresponding to 0.33/pixel at the telescope prime focus and each one covers an area on sky of 22.8@xmath511.4arcmin . the total sky coverage per exposure for the array",
    "is therefore 0.29 square degrees .",
    "figure  [ fig : wfc_ccd ] shows an schematic layout of the ccd detectors in the wfc .",
    "gaps between detectors are typically 20 .",
    "chip 3 is slightly vignetted in one corner .",
    "optical observations described below are carried out considering the wfc as a 3-ccd camera , allowing for a 10% overlap between adjacent pointings for photometric purposes .",
    "therefore the area not observed in each pointing due to the chip gaps is about 12 square arcmin .",
    "however , the spatial source density of _ elais_and radio sources is not high enough to make this effect important for the process of identification .",
    "the wfs surveyed @xmath3200 square degrees in different well known regions of sky with data at other wavelengths .",
    "the _ elais_regions n1 and n2 were also included .",
    "the survey consists of single 600s exposures in five bands : u , g , r , i and z ( see figure  [ fig : filters ] ) to magnitude limits of : 23.4 , 24.9 , 24.0 , 23.2 , 21.9 respectively ( vega , 5@xmath6 for a point - like object ) , i.e. , about 1 magnitude deeper than the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "a total of 108 pointings were done in n1 and n2 , covering a total area of 18 square degrees .",
    "typical seeing is about 1.0 - 1.2 .",
    "the data are processed by the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) as described in irwin & lewis ( 2000 ) and we provide here a short description of the reduction steps .",
    "the data are first debiassed ( full 2d bias removal is necessary ) .",
    "bad pixels and columns are then flagged and recorded in confidence maps , which are used during catalogue generation .",
    "the ccds are found to have significant non linearities so a correction using look - up - tables is then applied to all data .",
    "flatfield images in each band are constructed by combining several sky flats obtained in bright sky conditions during the twilight .",
    "exposures obtained in the i and z bands show a significant level of fringing ( @xmath72% and @xmath76% of sky respectively ) . in order to remove this effect ,",
    "master fringe frames are created by combining all the science exposures for each band .",
    "these fringe frames are then subtracted from the object exposures .",
    "after this removal , the fringing level is reduced to @xmath70.2% and @xmath70.4% of sky in the i and z bands respectively .",
    "finally an astrometric solution starts with a rough wcs based on the known telescope and camera geometry and is the progressively refined using the guide star catalogue for a first pass and the apm or pmm catalogues for a final pass .",
    "the wfc field distortion is modelled using a zenithal equidistant projection ( zpn ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting internal astrometric precision is better than 100 mas over the whole wfc array ( based on intercomparison of overlap regions ) .",
    "global systematics are limited by the precision of the apm and pmm astrometric catalogue systems and are at the level of 300 mas .",
    "the object detection is performed in each band separately using a standard apm - style object detection and parametrisation algorithm .",
    "standard aperture fluxes are measured in a set of apertures of radius @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 pixels and an automatic aperture correction ( based on the average curve - of - growth for stellar images ) is applied to all detected objects .",
    "photometric calibration is done using series of landoldt standard stars ( landoldt 1992 ) with photometry in the sdss system . for each night a zero point in each filter is derived . for photometric nights",
    "the calibration over the whole mosaic has an accuracy of 1 - 2% . during non - photometric nights , in otherwise acceptable observing conditions , we find that the derived zeropoint systematic errors can be up to 10% or more .",
    "although the pipeline usually successfully flags such nights as non - photometric it still leaves open the problem of what to do about tracking the varying extinction during these nights .",
    "all calibration is by default corrected for the mean atmospheric extinction at la palma during pipeline processing ( 0.46 in u , 0.19 in g@xmath14 , 0.09 in r@xmath14 and 0.05 in i@xmath14 and z ) .",
    "since adjacent camera pointings overlap by several square arcminutes sources in these overlapping regions can be used as magnitude comparison points .",
    "however , to use overlapping and hence in general , different ccds , requires that any repeatable systematics due to , for example , slight differences in the colour equations for each ccd , are first corrected for .",
    "correcting for these is a three stage process .",
    "first the twilight flatfields are used to gain - correct each ccd onto a common system . however , since the twilight sky is significantly bluer than most astronomical objects , a secondary correction is made using the measured dark sky levels in each ccd for each filter to provide a correction more appropriate for the majority astronomical object .",
    "these corrections , unsurprisingly , are negligible for passbands on the flat part of the generic ccd response curves such as g and r , and amount to 1 - 2% for the i and z passbands .",
    "the measured dark sky values for the u - band were also consistent with zero correction though with less accuracy due to the low sky levels in the u - band images .",
    "finally any residual offsets between the ccds are checked for each survey filter using the mean offset between adjacent pointings on photometric survey nights .",
    "the only filters requiring significant adjustments to the individual ccd zero points at this stage are ccd3 for u ( -3% ) and ccd1 for z ( + 3% ) .",
    "data from non - photometric nights can now be calibrated in one of two ways : the overlap regions between pointings can be used to directly tie in all the frames onto a common system , with extra weighting given to data taken from photometric nights ; the stellar locus in various 2-colour diagrams ( in regions of low unchanging extinction like these ) can be used to compare colours from all the passbands by cross - correlating the loci between any of the pointings .",
    "the colour - colour loci cross - correlations ( actually made from a smoothed hess - like version of the diagrams ) give results accurate to better than + /-3% and can be used in conjunction with the overlap results to give overall photometry for the survey to the level of @xmath152% .",
    "the final products include astrometrically calibrated images as well as morphologically classified merged multicolour catalogues , publically available from the wfs web page ( ` http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~wfcsur/index.php ` ) .    for the purpose of this work , we have also carried out the object detection in the r band images using sextractor  @xcite . as well as",
    "providing a independent check for the extraction method used above , it gives us an extense set of parameters .",
    "aperture magnitudes from sextractor are found to be in agreement with the ones obtained from the wfs pipeline .",
    "therefore , together with the wfs aperture magnitudes we use ` mag_best ` as a measurement of the total magnitude in the r-band .",
    "the galaxy - star classification given by ` class_star ` is also used to select point - like objects ( defined to be ` class_star ` @xmath16 0.8 ) .    as an additional test of our photometric calibration",
    "we have correlated the wfs catalogues with those from the sloan digital sky survey first data release @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : wfs_sdss_r ] shows the result of this correlation for the r band magnitude .",
    "once accounted for the small correction between both filters ( @xmath17 ) the agreement is within 0.04 magnitudes ( note also that a second order correction due to different object spectral energy distributions is not removed , so the accuracy is better than the quoted 0.04 ) .     has been applied to account for the slight filter and system differences.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the final analysis of the 15@xmath0 m data using the lari method @xcite for the _ elais_northern fields has recently been completed ( maccari et  al .",
    "2004 , in prep ) .",
    "the two main northern fields n1 and",
    "n2 are centred at @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 respectively .",
    "we have obtained a sample of 1056 sources ( 490 in n1 and 566 in n2 ) to a @xmath22 flux limit of 0.45mjy .",
    "this catalogue includes sources detected in deeper observations ( in particular , the central 40@xmath540n2 area has been observed three times ) so this flux limit is not homogenous over the whole survey area . as part of the multiwavelenth follow - up observations carried out in these regions",

    "deg . in the n1 ,",
    "n2 and n3 areas .",
    "they detect a total of 867 sources ( 362 in n1 , 329 in n2 and 176 in n3 ) above a flux limit 0.135 mjy in the deeper observations or 1.15 mjy over the shallower ones .",
    "we have selected sources for which we have optical data from the wfs ( i.e. , sources in n1 and n2 ) .",
    "multi - component sources ( flagged in the catalogue as a , b or c components ) have been removed and only the calculated central position considered ( t in the catalogue ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the positional errors in ra and dec for the _ elais_sources result from the combination of three quantities : the finite spatial sampling ( @xmath23 ) , the reduction method ( @xmath24 ) and the pointing accuracy ( @xmath25 ) . the simulation work carried out in the _ elais_fields yield next relations : @xmath26    these equations have been used to estimate the positional errors due to mapping and reduction method as a function of each source s signal - to - noise ratio , s / n .    the errors introduced by uncertainties in the _ isocam_pointing have been estimated by correlating the _ iso_sources with the usno catalogue of optical objects @xcite . for each raster , both catalogues have been correlated using a maximum search distance of 12 .",
