    "<S> either a lower bound or an exact critical probability can be obtained with this method and the correlation - length critical exponent is approximately estimated as @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the percolation problem is a question about how a global connection can be made possible by randomly filling local components by a certain probability @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> while it can be explained in purely geometric terms without any interaction , when a global connection actually appears , the macroscopic behavior of the system exhibits all the characteristic features of a continuous phase transition with a diverging correlation length , just as we observe in other interacting spin systems such as the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this analogy is given a precise meaning by the fortuin - kasteleyn representation of the @xmath2-state potts model  @xcite , where the percolation turns out to be equivalent to the limit of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> since the percolation transition at a critical probability @xmath4 has a diverging correlation length , every microscopic length scale becomes irrelevant with respect to the critical phenomena , and the system behaves as if it does not have any specific length scale . </S>",
    "<S> this is a qualitative explanation of the reason why a percolating cluster connecting two opposite sides of a 2d plane has a fractal dimension at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of a specific length scale implies that the system remains statistically invariant even if we zoom the system up or down , and this scale invariance readily lends itself to a renormalization - group ( rg ) study of the percolation problem  @xcite .    in certain cases where the underlying structure itself is fractal , it is possible to carry out the rg calculation to a good approximation or exactly , exploiting this fractal property  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such fractal structures usually contain groups of bonds which connect longer and longer distances in a regular fashion . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , one can sometimes arrange the groups of bonds in a hierarchical way according to their connection lengths . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) is an example of a hierarchical structure called the enhanced binary tree , which is obtained by adding horizontal bonds to the simple binary tree . </S>",
    "<S> it is hierarchical in the sense that filling a horizontal bond is comparable to a very long connection along the bottom layer and the connection length is dependent on the level of the horizontal bond  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , a horizontal bond in the highest level can connect two points at distance 7 along the bottom layer at maximum . </S>",
    "<S> for a horizontal bond at the next highest level , this maximum connection distance is only as large as 3 lattice spacings . </S>",
    "<S> an rg scheme for the enhanced binary tree is described in @xcite as shown in ( b ) : we calculate the probability for any of the leftmost points to connect to any of the rightmost points within the cell as a function of the bare coupling @xmath1 and a coarse - grained effective coupling @xmath6 , and then replace this probability by a new effective bond with strength @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expression for @xmath7 is written as @xmath8.\\ ] ] by asking when @xmath9 becomes 1 , we obtained a lower bound of the percolation threshold as @xmath10  @xcite , which is consistent with the conclusion in @xcite that @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> note that we get a lower bound since in iterating @xmath6 to @xmath7 , there is a small chance to regard a layer as percolated when it is actually not [ see , e.g. , ( c ) ] , whereas the opposite is not possible .    . </S>",

    "<S> , we present a variation of the rg scheme shown above . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity is obvious : we have taken away only one bond out of those in ( b ) , and this is meant to describe the triangular lattice . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , we find @xmath31 once again , but this value is identical to the exact value for the bond - percolation problem in the square lattice  @xcite . since this method is supposed to give a lower bound , it should not be possible to improve this result further , so it will be worth checking whether this value really remains unchanged for a larger cell . from a larger cell depicted in ( f ) , we obtain a recursion @xmath43 and find its limiting value as @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . </S>",

    "<S> the fact that @xmath48 does not change with @xmath18 could be an evidence that the bond - percolation threshold is located exactly at @xmath49 for the square lattice .    </S>",

    "<S> in other words , the correlation length would be written as @xmath52 . </S>",

    "<S> it is worth noting that this rg scheme does not make use of any explicit scaling transformation : we do not zoom up or zoom down the system at criticality as usually found in rg studies  @xcite . in arguing the value of @xmath62 , therefore , we evaluate it directly in units of the given lattice spacing instead of any zooming ratio . by setting @xmath63 , in a sense , </S>",

    "<S> we have also approximately estimated @xmath0 . </S>",
