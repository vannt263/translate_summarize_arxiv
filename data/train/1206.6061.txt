    "the nee to understand the evolution of a wave - packet ( for instance , one particle in a one dimensional lattice ) has been motivated by many problems in solid state physics @xcite , quantum information @xcite , quantum open systems @xcite and quantum optics qn , zahringer , among others . in solid state physics in particular , the spread of a wave - packet from a highly localized initial state in the tight - binding lattice approximation @xcite has drawn the attention of many authors @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the concept of quantum walk ( qw ) , borrowed from classical statistics aharanov , vk95,kempe , katsanos , has the same properties as a tight - binding free particle @xcite .",
    "two kinds of qw are considered in the literature : discrete - time quantum coined walk zahringer , schreiber , aharanov , kempe , konno , chandrashekar , romanelli , broome , shapira , dur , joye , schmitz and continuous - time qw yue , katsanos , esposito , manuel - karina , blumen2,perets , peruzzo . in the former ( proposed by aharonov et al.@xcite ) , a two - level state , the so - called `` coin '' , rules the unitary discrete - time evolution of a particle moving in a lattice . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of the particle in the continuous - time qw is determined by a tight - binding like hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to see , by simple comparison , that a mapping between the _ tight - binding _ hamiltonian and the qw model can be established ( see appendix a ) .",
    "there are some important differences between a classical random walk ( crw ) and a qw and these differences are well known in the literature yue , schreiber , kampen , libro .",
    "the most important of these differences is the fact that for a tight - binding free particle the deviation @xmath0 of the wave - packet becomes linear in time @xmath1 ( qw ) , in contrast to the crw result that becomes similar to @xmath2 .",
    "this issue can be resolved straightforwardly , by analyzing , in the heisenberg picture , the time evolution of the second moment of the position of the free particle @xcite .",
    "qws have been studied for possible applications in quantum information and quantum computation algorithms kempe , nielsen .",
    "discrete - time evolution in random media has recently been used to study entanglement and quantum correlations in order to understand the role of noise and the mechanism of decoherence between the internal and spatial degrees of freedom in a qw @xcite .",
    "the study of a qw subjected to different sources of decoherence is an active topic that has been considered by several authors , in particular , due to their interest in understanding laser cooling experiments @xcite , modeling blinking statistics @xcite , and carrying out quantum simulations @xcite .",
    "experimental study of quantum decoherence in discrete - time qw using single photons in the space was performed in broome .",
    "these authors considered pure dephasing as a decoherence mechanism and they could explore the quantum to classical transition by means of tunable decoherence .",
    "in other theoretical studies yue , shapira , dur , konno , joye , the authors analyzed discrete - time and continuous - time qw in a random environment , and they could also study the quantum - classical transition . in @xcite",
    "the authors study qw with decoherence by analyzing a non - unitary evolution in qw .",
    "experimental analysis of qw in a random environment led to the study of quantum optical devices @xcite ; interestingly , these experiments also show the non - classical behavior in dqw .    in classical statistics and via the central limit theorem",
    ", the gaussian distribution plays a fundamental role in all random walks with finite mean square displacement per step @xcite . in quantum statistics , however , this analysis is much more complex because quantum thermal average must be taken using the reduced density matrix . on the other hand , in the markov approximation , the time - evolution for the reduced density matrix requires a much more complex infinitesimal generator , and in fact this generator has been studied extensively , for many years , and is nowadays called the kossakoski - lindblad generator @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting facts that distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical mechanics is the coherent superposition of distinct physical states .",
    "many of the non - intuitive aspects of the quantum theory of matter can be traced to the coherent superposition feature .",
    "related to this issue , an interesting question arises : how does coherent superposition operate in the presence of dissipation ?",
    "these subjects have been important issues of research since the pioneer works of feynman and vernon @xcite and , caldeira and leggett @xcite , among others , see for example the references cited in : @xcite .    an important fact in modeling a realistic qw",
    "is the inclusion of the quantum thermal bath @xmath3 from the very beginning in order to get a dissipative open system @xcite . to emphasize this fact we call this continuous - time model a dissipative quantum walk ( dqw ) , and",
    "this may be a mechanism of decoherence in a qw .",
    "nevertheless there are many other mechanism of decoherence , see for example @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "this pioneer problem was well posed in van kampen s paper @xcite , but many other related approaches have also been presented in the literature @xcite . the propagation of photons in waveguide lattices have been studied in recent years @xcite , and they are possible scenarios where our present results can be applied .    in the present paper",
    "we study an open system in the markov approximation to continuous - time @xcite , i.e. , a quantum mechanical particle that moves along a lattice by hopping while interacting with a thermal phonon bath @xmath3 .",
    "we have chosen an interaction hamiltonian with the bath in such a way that this interaction produces the hopping in the tight - binding particle .",
    "therefore , we highlight some of the issues of interpretation of the coherent superposition by tackling a soluble hopping model",
    ". the asymptotic long - time regime of the quantum probability , wigner 's function , quantum entropy , quantum purity , etc . , are characterized as a function of the dissipation . the long - time decoherent behavior is also explained in terms of the present dissipative hopping model .",
    "this model analytically reproduces the ( non - equilibrium ) continuous transition from dqw to crw when the diffusion coefficient goes to infinity ( i.e. : when the temperature of the bath @xmath4 ) .",
    "we have considered a free particle model ( tight - binding approximation , for example see @xcite ) constrained to a one - dimensional regular and infinity lattice ( in one band side ) in interaction with a thermal bath of phonon @xmath3 .",
    "the total hamiltonian for this problem can be written in the form @xcite:@xmath5    the first term corresponds to the _ tight - binding _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are translational operators in the wannier bases @xmath9 ( it is easy to write these operators in second quantization , for more details see appendix [ ap1:sec - quan ] ) and @xmath10 is the identity operator .",
    "the second term is the interaction hamiltonian and corresponds to a linear coupling between phonon operators @xmath11 and system operators @xmath12 , here @xmath13 is the coupling parameter .",
    "the third term is the phonon hamiltonian written in terms of boson operators @xmath14 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath15 is the _ tight - binding _ energy of site and @xmath16 the associated next neighbor hopping energy .",
    "the quantum master equation ( qme ) for our dqw model can be obtained by eliminating the variables of the quantum thermal bath and assuming for the initial condition of the total density matrix @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the equilibrium density matrix of the quantum bath @xmath3 .",

    "we can add an additive constant to the _ tight - binding _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath25 .",
    "this assumption does not change the general results and finally we can write : @xmath26as was presented in previous references @xcite .",
    "it can be noted from eq.([qme ] ) that as @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , the von neumann equation is recovered ( unitary evolution ) .      from the qme eq.([qme ] ) , we can obtain the dynamics of any operator , in particular here we are interested in the evolution of the dispersion of the position operator @xmath29 , which in the wannier basis has the matrix elements ( @xmath30 is an eigenvalue of @xmath29):@xmath31note that @xmath29 is defined as a dimensionless position operator with lattice parameter @xmath32",

    "the quantum thermal statistical average -of any operator- in the heisenberg picture can be written as @xmath42 $ ] . then for the variance of the dqw",
    "we get : @xmath43which is the expected dissipative result vk95,manuel - karina , manuel , kampen . from the eqs .",
    "( [ 1mom ] ) and ( 2mom ) , it is possible to see that von neumann s term gives a contribution of the form @xmath44 for the time - evolution of the second moment , this is a well known quantum result .",
    "in fact for the null dissipation case ,   @xmath45  we get that anderson s boundaries ( ballistic peak ) movement is controlled by the linear law of the deviation of the wave - packet:@xmath46therefore , we can associate the quantity @xmath47 with the velocity of anderson s boundaries in a one - dimensional regular lattice .",
    "in the appendix [ ap2:momen ] we have calculated the second moment of the position operator by using the characteristic function , which is useful for calculating all quantum thermal moments .    in the next section we will present , in detail , results concerning the probability profile of our quantum open model ( @xmath48 ) ,",
    "i.e. , _ a dissipative tight - binding free particle_. we will study the time - evolution of the reduced density matrix @xcite , characterize its decoherence , and solve , analytically , some correlation functions associated with the coherent superposition feature .",
    "in order to consider the evolution of our free particle in interaction with the quantum thermal bath @xmath3 , we have to solve the qme , eq.(qme ) , for any time .",
    "this can be done in the fourier representation .",
