    "letter _ we investigate the possibility that stellar wind shocks in the galactic center also efficiently accelerate electrons and protons to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "this claim is motivated by the analogy between the strong collisionless shocks expected in the galactic center and similar shocks in supernovae remnants and @xmath1-ray bursts that are inferred to be efficient sites of particle acceleration ( e.g. , drury 1983 ; blandford & eichler 1987 ) .",
    "we show that a population of relativistic particles in the central parsec of the galaxy produces detectable emission from the radio to the @xmath1-rays (  2 ) .",
    "we then compare the predictions of our model with current observations and discuss its further implications (  3 ) .",
    "we focus primarily on emission by relativistic electrons because it has fewer uncertainties , but we also briefly consider pion production by relativistic protons .",
    "the total kinetic energy thermalized by shocks in the galactic center is @xmath17 ergs s@xmath5 , where @xmath18 is the total stellar mass loss rate , @xmath19 is the average wind speed , and @xmath20 accounts for geometric uncertainties such as the fraction of the stellar wind material that undergoes strong shocks ( the normalization for @xmath21 is taken from the 3d simulations of rockefeller et al .",

    "we assume that a fraction @xmath22 of the shock energy goes into accelerating relativistic electrons , where the normalization of @xmath23 is motivated by observations of supernova remnants ( see , e.g. ,  2.2.2 of keshet et al .",

    "equipartition field strength could in principle also be generated by the shocks themselves ( e.g. , medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",

    ", we find a very low gev @xmath1-ray luminosity from pion production on the ambient hot plasma , @xmath64 .",
    "a more promising source of @xmath1-rays from pion decay in the central few parsecs is the interaction between the shock accelerated protons and the circum - nuclear disk ( cnd ) .",

    "the normalization for @xmath71 is based on the solid angle subtended by the inner edge of the cnd , but in principle @xmath71 could be much smaller if relativistic particles are magnetically shielded out of the cnd .",
    "the cooling time for relativistic protons due to pion production in the cnd is @xmath72 years .",
    "by contrast , the timescale for relativistic protons to escape from the cnd is uncertain , and depends sensitively on the magnetic field geometry and cross - field diffusion .",
    "unless the effective diffusion velocity is @xmath73 , however , the protons will lose all of their energy in the cnd because the cooling time is shorter the escape time . under this assumption ,",

    "[ pion ] equation ( [ pion ] ) predicts the maximum @xmath1-ray luminosity not far below that produced by relativistic electrons ( eq . [ [ spect ] ] ) , but the estimate is much less certain because the relativistic protons might quickly leak out of the cnd along open magnetic field lines .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath1-rays from pion decay would extend from @xmath74 mev to many tev , with the maximum photon energy determined by the maximum energy of the accelerated protons .",
    "figure 1 summarizes our estimates of the ic and synchrotron radiation expected from shock accelerated electrons in the central parsec .",
    "we do not include the predicted radiation from pion decay estimated in  2.3 because it is much less certain , though we reiterate that the @xmath1-ray flux from pion decay in the cnd could be non - negligible .",
    "figure 1 also summarizes some of the data relevant to our predictions .",
    "in particular , ic radiation of the ambient fir radiation field can account for the tev source seen by hess ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005 ) and cangaroo ( tsuchiya et al . 2004 ) towards the galactic center . in figure 1",
    "we have adjusted the normalization of the ic component to account for the hess luminosity by setting @xmath75 in equation ( [ spect ] ) .",
    "our model naturally accounts for the hess spectrum and makes the strong prediction that the _ gamma - ray large area space telescope _ ( _ glast _ ) should observe a cooling break at @xmath6 gev .",
    "the energy of the cooling break is very well determined in our model ( eq . [ [ emin ] ] ) since it is set by the uv radiation energy density and the expansion time of the thermal plasma , both of which are observationally well constrained .",
    "atoyan & dermer ( 2004 ) also explain the tev emission from the galactic center as ic scattering of fir photons by relativistic electrons ( see pohl 1997 and melia et al .",
    "1998 for related ideas in the context of the _ egret _ source 3eg j1746 - 2851 , which is now believed to be well - offset from the central parsec ; pohl 2005 ) . in their model , however , the electrons are produced in the termination shock of an outflow from sgr a*. on energetic grounds , the shocked stellar winds investigated in this _",
    "letter _ may be a more important source of particle acceleration : the accretion rate onto sgr a * is believed to be @xmath76 ( e.g. , agol 2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) , implying a total accretion power @xmath77 , somewhat smaller than the energy thermalized by shocked stellar winds in the central parsec .",
    "in addition , the presence of stellar wind shocks in the central parsec is observationally well established , while the properties of an outflow from sgr a * ( its mass loss rate , collimation , etc . )",
    "are significantly less well understood .",
    "in addition to ic emission at high energies , we also predict that synchrotron radiation from shock accelerated electrons in the central parsec leads to a diffuse background of radiation from @xmath2 thz to @xmath2 kev ( fig .",
    "1 ) , with a surface brightness given by equation ( [ synchsb ] ) .",
    "this emission would be extended on the scale of the central stellar cluster , @xmath78 .",
    "the magnitude of the diffuse synchrotron emission is sensitive to the magnetic field strength in the central parsec , which is poorly constrained observationally . )",
    "scales , larosa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argue that the field strength is @xmath79 g , while the prevalence of nonthermal radio filaments has been used to argue for @xmath80 g ( e.g. , morris & serabyn 1996 ) . ]",
    "the most stringent observationally limits to date on diffuse emission at the relevant wavelengths are probably from deep _ chandra _ observations which find extended thermal emission with a surface brightness of @xmath81 in the central few parsecs ( baganoff et al .",
    "2003 ) . using equation ( [ synchsb ] ) with @xmath82 appropriate for the fir radiation field scattered by electrons with @xmath83 , we find that the _ chandra _ observations require that the magnetic field strength in the central parsec be @xmath84 in order to not overproduce the extended x - ray emission .",
    "it is worth highlighting that future probes of the nonthermal diffuse emission could directly constrain the magnetic field in the central parsec . in particular ,",
    "the ratio of the luminosity of the diffuse emission to the luminosity of the hess tev source is determined by @xmath85 and thus can be used to measure @xmath86 .",
    "such a measurement would provide a very useful outer boundary condition for models of accretion onto sgr a * , which are sensitive to the geometry and magnitude of the magnetic field at large radii ( e.g. , igumenshchev & narayan 2002 ) .",
    "lastly , we note that some fraction of the shock accelerated electrons and protons in the central parsec should be gravitationally captured by sgr a * along with the thermal plasma , providing a seed population of relativistic particles to the accretion flow .",
    "the lorentz factor of such particles will , at a minimum , increase via adiabatic compression as @xmath87 .",
    "the density contrast between the bondi accretion radius ( @xmath88 ) and the event horizon is believed to be a factor of @xmath89 ( see quataert 2003 for a review ) , implying that mildly relativistic electrons at @xmath90 have @xmath91 close to the black hole .",
    "such electrons would emit in the mm - mir and could contribute significantly to the observed emission from sgr a*. this possibility will be explored in more detail in a future paper .",
