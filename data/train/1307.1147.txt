    "cold atom physics is constantly progressing at a rapid pace .",
    "fermi and bose systems have been under consideration extensively .",
    "bose - fermi ( bf ) mixtures have been studied so far a little less . in early attempts to create a degenerate fermi gas , bosonic @xmath1li @xcite or @xmath2na atoms @xcite were added to the fermionic @xmath3li in order to allow for sympathetic cooling . the first bf mixture with",
    "an attractive bf interaction was that of @xmath4k and @xmath5rb @xcite .",
    "in present - day experiments with @xmath3li , a small fraction of @xmath1li atoms is kept to serve as a thermometer @xcite . in @xcite a mixture of @xmath4k , @xmath6k , and @xmath3li was created with the main goal to produce a mass - imbalanced fermi gas of @xmath4k and @xmath3li , the boson @xmath6k acting again as a coolant . the possibility to produce",
    "a dipolar fermi gas of polar fermionic molecules has triggered many experiments with different bf mixtures such as @xmath5rb-@xmath4k @xcite , @xmath2na-@xmath4k @xcite , and @xmath2na-@xmath3li @xcite .",
    "experiments with bf mixtures are not restricted to alkaline atoms .",
    "for instance , also @xmath7sr-@xmath5sr @xcite mixtures were created .    from the theory perspective ,",
    "bf mixtures are interesting in their own right , e.g. , to study the interplay between different quantum statistics in various fields of physics .",
    "they also may serve to simulate definite physical systems .",
    "for example , bf mixtures have been considered as an analogy to what might happen in the quark - hadron phase transition @xcite within the scenario that first two quarks form a tightly bound diquark ( boson ) which then combines with a third quark ( fermion ) to form a nucleon .",
    "it , thus , is important to further develop the theory of bf correlations in bf mixtures .",
    "a particularly interesting question concerns the structure and behavior of bf pairs . in @xcite we have shown that similar to the formation of cooper pairs in two component fermi systems , also in bf mixtures stable bf pairs can exist with very weak attraction for which a bound state can not be formed in free space .    in this work",
    ", we shall be concerned with bosons and fermions interacting via a broad feshbach resonance . under this condition ,",
    "the system can be described by a hamiltonian of bosons and ( spinless ) fermions interacting via an attractive ( or repulsive ) contact potential . there",
    "exist several monte carlo investigations in 1d @xcite and 3d @xcite bf systems .",
    "however , also approximate many body approches have been applied . among",
    "those several works using the so - called @xmath0-matrix approximation have appeared @xcite and this shall also be our framework in this paper .",
    "the bf @xmath0-matrix describes bf scattering states but also eventuel formation of bound states .",
    "bound states in the medium are especially interesting .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix also can serve to study single particle properties . in this respect , folding the @xmath0-matrix with either a fermion or a boson propagator yields the boson or fermion self - energy of the dyson equation .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix approximation has become particularly popular since nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) showed that for attractive fermi systems this approach interpolates beween the weak coupling ( bcs ) situation and the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of strongly bound fermion pairs @xcite .",
    "this approach has also been generalized to study the pairing properties of polarized fermi systems where there exist more fermions with , e.g. , spin @xmath8 than those with spin @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , these studies have revealed that in this case the standard nsr approach may lead , in some regions of the parameter space , to pathological results .",
    "a special case of particular interest is that of an extremely imbalanced mixture , which can be treated by considering a single atom of the minority species , the so - called polaron limit .",
    "the case of fermi polarons , i.e. , a single fermion of spin @xmath9 in a system of fermions with spin @xmath8 , has been intensively studied using a variational ansatz @xcite and , equivalently , a @xmath0-matrix approach @xcite , as well as using a diagrammatic monte - carlo technique @xcite .",
    "all these results can be directly applied to bf mixtures with a very small number of bosons , because if one considers only a single impurity it does not matter whether it is a fermion or a boson .    in the present paper",
    ", we will pay special attention to an aspect that so far has not been considered , namely the luttinger theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that the volume of the fermi sphere is not changed by interactions , or in other words , that the reduction of the occupation numbers @xmath10 inside the fermi sphere is exactly compensated by the non - vanishing occupation numbers @xmath11 outside the fermi sphere .",
    "it is highly non - trivial to respect this theorem within a non - perturbative approximation scheme . here",
    ", we will use a variant of the nsr approach adapted to bf systems .",
    "a particularity of the nsr approach is that it treats the self - energy in the single - particle dyson equation only to first order .",
    "this , for instance , means that the nsr approach , if suitably adapted , is strictly equivalent to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , here in the so - called particle - particle ( pp ) channel which sums pp and hh ( hole - hole ) ladders simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the fact that pp - rpa satisfies , among other things , the analog of the luttinger theorem in a system with a discrete level structure such as atomic nuclei has been known for many years @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated for a bf system on a lattice @xcite .",
    "but to the best of our knowledge , this has never been explicitly shown in a continuum case .",
    "it will be one of the results of the present work to show this for an attractively interacting infinite bf system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2p ]",
    "we discuss the bf scattering in a bf mixture within the pp - rpa framework . in section [ sec:1p ]",
    "we discuss the correlation effects on the ground - state properties . finally , in section [ sec : summary ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "the starting point of our study is the following bf hamiltonian : @xmath12\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the fermion and boson field operators , @xmath15 are the fermion and boson masses , and @xmath16 is the coupling constant .",
    "the field operator @xmath14 has been shifted by a c - number @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the density of condensed bosons @xcite .",
    "the field operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be written in terms of fermion and boson annihilation operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 as @xmath21 analogously , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be written in terms of fermion and boson creation operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is suitable for the case of a broad feshbach resonance in the bf interaction @xcite .",
    "we neglect the boson - boson ( bb ) interaction .",
    "a repulsive bb interaction would essentially result in a mean - field shift that can be absorbed in a redefinition of the boson chemical potential and does not change the results very much @xcite .",
    "since we assume that the fermions are present in only one spin state ( `` spinless fermions '' ) , there can not be an @xmath26-wave fermion - fermion ( ff ) interaction and higher partial waves are usually negligible in ultracold trapped atoms .",
    "as mentioned before , we want to apply a suitably adapted nsr approach to the present bf problem .",
    "we will work at zero temperature and with chronological green s functions ( gfs ) .",
    "in standard notation @xcite we have for the single - particle fermion and non - condensed boson gfs @xmath27 where @xmath0 means time - ordering .",
    "the corresponding free boson and fermion propagators in frequency space are given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the non - interacting boson and fermion energies and @xmath31 is the fermi momentum , related to the fermion density @xmath32 by @xmath33 .",
    "we use these free gfs to construct the bf @xmath0-matrix in ladder approximation .",
    "the result can be written as @xcite @xmath34 the regularized bf scattering matrix @xmath35 with no boson in the condensate is a standard expression which can be found in the literature @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the reduced mass , @xmath38 is the bf scattering length , and @xmath39 denotes the uncorrelated bf propagator that is given by @xmath40\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath41 .",
    "the feynman diagrams corresponding to the @xmath35 and @xmath0-matrices are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - feynmandiagram](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "feynman diagrams corresponding to the formulas in the text.,width=302 ]    for the following calculations it is important to study the analytical properties of the @xmath0-matrix . the continuum threshold ,",
    "i.e. , the energy above which the @xmath0-matrix has an imaginary part , lies at @xmath42 where @xmath43 . for not too high momenta @xmath44",
    ", @xmath45 has a pole at @xmath46 below this threshold . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath0-matrix has one or two poles below threshold : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the continuum part and @xmath49 is the residue of the pole at @xmath50 ( if there is only one pole , we set @xmath51 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - dispersion ]      +        we show the dispersion of the two poles of @xmath0 for some cases .",
    "the poles are physically of very different nature .",
    "@xmath52 is a collective pole created by bf scattering with the boson always out of the condensate .",
    "@xmath53 stems from the elastic scattering of the fermion off the bose condensate and , thus , it is essentially given by the free fermion dispersion .",
    "this is also the reason why @xmath53 lies in the upper half of the complex plane for @xmath54 , as it is in the case of the free fermion gf ( [ gfermifree ] ) .",
    "of course , in @xmath0 both branches interact and depending on the system parameters they can be more or less repelled from one another .",
    "an interesting aspect , already revealed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the @xmath52 branch corresponds to a stable bf pair that exists even for very weak attraction so that there is no bound state in free space .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to the existence of the cooper pole in a pure two species fermi gas , since the stability of the bf pair in weak coupling is due to the fact that there is still a sharp fermi edge in the problem .    at this point",
    "it is worth discussing a subtle point of the theory related to a possible crossing or inversion of the two branches shown as the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - dispersion ] . in an unpolarized spin-1/2 fermi system , it is known from the thouless criterion that once the @xmath0-matrix has a pole at @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is the fermion chemical potential ) , an instability towards the superfluid ( superconducting ) state appears , and that for lower temperatures and in particular for zero temperature the ground state of the system has to be changed from the hartree - fock ( hf ) to the bcs one @xcite . in our bf case , one would think that there should be also some criterion that tells us when our description of a single bf pair in an uncorrelated ground state becomes invalid and the ground state has to be changed into a state consisting of many interacting bf pairs .",
    "we are not aware that such a criterion has been given in the literature .",
    "however , we will see in section  [ sec:1p ] that as soon as @xmath57 drops below @xmath58 for @xmath54 , the correlation energy does no longer vanish in the limit @xmath59 , as it should .",
    "we therefore suspect that in this case our theory is not valid any more and we discard in the present work cases in the parameter space where this happens ( e.g. , lower panels of fig . [ fig - dispersion ] ) .    contrary to the case of spin-1/2 fermions , where the new ground state of bose condensed cooper pairs can be described within bcs theory , it is unclear how this new ground state of correlated bf pairs should look like . in any case",
    ", as it was pointed out in @xcite , it is obvious that since the bf pairs are fermions , this can not be treated as in bcs theory as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this problem shall be a very interesting subject for future studies .",
    "in order to obtain the occupation numbers in the correlated ground state , let us get back to the single - particle gfs .",
    "as in the standard nsr approach @xcite , where the particle number is obtained from a gf in which the self - energy in the dyson equation is treated only to lowest order [ diagrams fig .",
    "[ fig - feynmandiagram](d ) and ( e ) ] , we will write for the boson and fermion gfs @xmath60 the self - energies in ladder approximation are defined by @xmath61 and @xmath62 see feynman diagrams in fig .",

    "( [ gfirst ] ) , we treat the correlation effects only to leading order . to be consistent",
    ", we should therefore not include the condensate depletion into the calculation of the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "in other words , for the condensate density @xmath18 that enters the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath64 , we put @xmath65 @xmath66 being the total boson density , since in an uncorrelated system at zero temperature all bosons are condensed .",
    "although one might be tempted to use the `` final '' condensate density as a better approximation for @xmath18 , one should remember that standard rpa @xcite is always built on top of the uncorrelated ground state , and only in this way one can be sure that it respects all theorems ( see discussion below ) .",
    "notice that the first term of @xmath67 contains one - particle reducible diagrams ( i.e. , diagrams that can be separated by cutting a single fermion line ) , because in the @xmath0 matrix the boson can disappear in the condensate .",
    "nevertheless , this term has to be retained within rpa , and as long as @xmath67 is kept only to first order in eq .  ( [ gfirst ] ) this is not a problem .    using the above equations , the fermion and boson occupation numbers can be calculated from @xmath68 the upper ( lower ) sign being valid for bosons ( fermions ) . inserting the explicit expressions for the self - energies , one obtains    @xmath69 ^ 2}\\ , ,    \\label{fermiocc}\\\\ \\rho_b(k ) = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3}s_1(k)(\\omega_1(k)-\\varepsilon_f(k ) ) \\frac{\\theta(k_f - k)\\theta(|{\\bf k}-{\\bf k}|-k_f ) } { [ \\omega_1(k)-\\varepsilon_f({\\bf k}-{\\bf k})-\\varepsilon_b(k)]^2}\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the results for the occupation numbers",

    "note that , as a consequence of the perturbative treatment of the self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ gfirst ] ) , the @xmath73 factor determining the jump of @xmath74 at the fermi surface can become negative , or the number of bosons out of the condensate can become larger than the total number of bosons .",
    "we discard such cases and restrict ourselves to parameters in which the correlations are not too strong .",
    "the luttinger theorem states that in the fermion distribution the momentum integral over what is missing with respect to the free case below @xmath31 is exactly compensated by the part above @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath75 from general properties of rpa theory ( see below ) one expects that the luttinger theorem should be exactly fulfilled in our scheme , although from the final expression ( [ fermiocc ] ) for the occupation numbers this is hard to see . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "( [ luttingertheorem ] ) is fulfilled to a relative accuracy of better than @xmath76 .",
    "this is the advantage of treating the self - energy perturbatively in eq .",

    "8(a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite it seems that the number of fermions above the fermi surface because @xmath31 has a different meaning in that paper . ] is larger than the number of fermions missing below .",
    "in addition to the luttinger theorem ( [ luttingertheorem ] ) for the fermions , our formulation satisfies the following relation : @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the density of non - condensed bosons .",
    "the relation has a very intuitive interpretation : each time a boson is scattered out of the condensate , also a fermion is scattered out of the fermi sea .",
    "therefore the total number of fermions above @xmath31 must be equal to the number of bosons out of the condensate .",
    "the condensate depletion as a function of the interaction strength is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - depletion ] for different mass and density ratios .",

    "one recognizes the similarity with the nsr approach for the treatment of interacting two - component fermi gases close to the transition temperature to the superfluid state @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that the nsr formalism is transcribed here to an interacting bf system at zero temperature .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix , which sums in the case of a pure fermi system simultaneously the particle - particle ( pp ) and hole - hole ( hh ) ladders , is sometimes also called the pp - rpa @xcite .",
    "it is well known that rpa theory has appreciable properties as the fullfillment of conservation laws and sumrules .",
    "( the latter statements are , strictu - senso , only valid if the rpa is solved in the hf basis @xcite . however ,",
    "in our case the hf shifts are unimportant because they disappear in the regularization procedure when the coupling constant @xmath16 tends to zero while the cut - off tends to infinity , keeping the scattering length @xmath38 constant @xcite . )",
    "it is , in principle , straight forward to prove that the luttinger theorem is fulfilled in strict application of rpa .",
    "the proof is straight - forward and well known in the case of particle - hole ( ph ) rpa in a system with discrete single particle states as it is often considered in , e.g. , nuclear or atomic and chemical physics @xcite , i.e. , for finite fermi systems . in the case of pp - rpa",
    ", things are less well known but corresponding expressions can also be found in the literature @xcite . in the bf case , the fulfillment of the luttinger theorem , i.e. , the fact that the occupation numbers of levels above the fermi surface exactly cancel the reduction of the occupation numbers of levels below the fermi surface , has also been demonstrated for finite size cases with the hubbard model @xcite . to our knowledge , it has never been shown with rpa in continuum cases where things are , of course , a little more tricky , for instance from the numerical point of view .",
    "it is , however , very important to notice a subtle difference between this strict rpa approach and the nsr scheme .",
    "the latter is generally formulated in finite - temperature formalism , and the zero - temperature case is obtained as a limiting procedure as , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "however , the two formalisms do not become equivalent in this limit ( see , e.g. , chapter 3.3 of @xcite ) , even if the self energy is only treated to first order and not summed as in @xcite .",
    "we will elaborate in a forthcoming paper on this point .    in our scheme ,",
    "the particle numbers @xmath83 are fixed from the beginning and they are not modified by the inclusion of correlations ( because the luttinger theorem is satisfied ) .",
    "therefore we can not determine the chemical potentials in the way this is usual done in the nsr scheme by inverting the @xmath84 relation obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ occgeneral ] ) over @xmath44 .",
    "but of course , also in our scheme the correlations change the equation of state , i.e. , the relation between @xmath85 and @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , we have free chemical potentials , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and modified ones @xmath88 that include the correlation effects . but here the corrections to the chemical potentials are calculated perturbatively to first order in the correlations",
    ". they are obtained from the correlated ground state energy density , i.e. , @xmath89 the energy density @xmath90 is calculated within rpa in the usual way from the coupling constant integration @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the self - energy calculated with coupling constant @xmath93 instead of @xmath16 . considering a finite value of the coupling constant @xmath16 and a cutoff and taking the cutoff to infinity only in the end of the calculation , one obtains the following simple formula for the ground - state energy : @xmath94\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "this expression for the energy density agrees with that given in @xcite besides the fact that here the extra term of the fermion - hole boson - condensate matrix element is missing , since it has been absorbed by the regularization procedure . from this formula",

    "the boson and fermion chemical potentials calculated in this way are shown in fig .",

    ", it is often supposed that the luttinger theorem is satisfied ( see , e.g. , eq .",
    "( 6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) but it is rarely checked whether the approximations that are used preserve this property .",
    "the problems found in studies of polarized fermi systems @xcite might also be related to this problem .    as in the original nsr approach ,",
    "we keep the self - energies only to first order in the dyson equation .",
    "besides the nice properties mentioned before , this has of course also some drawbacks .",
    "for instance , the @xmath73 factor of the fermion gf ( i.e. , the jump of the occupation numbers at @xmath31 ) may become negative if the correlations are too strong . a possible way to avoid this over - estimation of the correlation effects , without violating the luttinger theorem , would be to use in the @xmath0 matrix the self - consistently determined correlated occupation numbers instead of the uncorrelated ones . in nuclear physics",
    "this approximation is known as `` renormalized rpa '' , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we also investigated the polaron limit and found that the boson chemical potential agrees well with the results by combescot et al .",
    "@xcite in the weak - coupling region .",
    "close to unitarity the results start to diverge , which is again a consequence of our perturbative treatment of the self - energy .",
    "if one goes in the molecular regime beyond the polaron limit , one expects the system to have a completely different ground state , namely a fermi sea of composite molecules .",
    "actually this transition might already happen before the molecular limit , since there is , as in the cooper pair problem , always a stable bf branch in the in - medium @xmath0 matrix , even if in free space there is no bound state .",
    "how this transition happens is still unclear @xcite and needs further investigation .",

    "<S> boson - fermion pair correlations in a mixture are considered at zero temperature in the @xmath0-matrix approximation . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is paid to the luttinger theorem . in a strict rpa variant of the nozires - schmitt - rink approach </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that this theorem is respected also in the homogeneous infinite matter case . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the corresponding occupation numbers of fermions and bosons and the condensate depletion . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that in the limit of very small boson density , our results are in good agreement with the results found in the literature for the fermi polaron in strongly imbalanced fermi - fermi mixtures . </S>"
