    "the parity - violating asymmetries of slac e158 and sld experiments have been interpreted as the asymmetries between opposite helicities for the standard model  @xcite using the chiral projection , approximated from the spin projection operator .",
    "helicity @xmath0 is defined by the momentum of a fermion and its spin orientation ; if the spin orientation is in the same direction as its momentum , it is called right - handed helicity(@xmath1 ) . and",
    "helicity can be observed to be opposite depending on the reference frame and is especially indefinite in the rest frame where momentum is zero .",
    "for example , a right - handed helicity massive fermion @xmath2 in one reference frame can be observed at the same time as @xmath3 with left - handed helicity by observers in other reference frames .",
    "chirality ( l , r ) is defined to indicate either of the two - component objects in a massive fermion field , and no physical measurement is available for the chirality of massive fermions and only when fermions are massless chirality becomes helicity .",
    "after a review of spin polarization , we investigate the validity of the chiral projection as an approximation of the spin polarization operator in the practical calculation of matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "spin polarization is defined by the direction of the spin relative to a given coordinate system , whereas helicity is relative to the momentum direction of the particle .",
