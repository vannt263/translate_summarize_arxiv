    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows the detection regions for the a and b components of a2218-flanking .",

    "we also measure the flux densities in the a and b components separately . for the a component , we find the f275w band flux density of @xmath48jy and the f606w band flux density of @xmath51jy , which leads to the ratio of @xmath52 . for the b component , we find a f606 band flux density of @xmath53jy , which is about 10 times fainter than that in the a component .",

    "these well - detected lyc fluxes suggest that a2217-flanking has a high lyc escape fraction .",
    "we estimate the relative lyc escape fraction @xmath59 by the following equation : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the intrinsic luminosity density ratio between 1700 and 800 , and @xmath9 is the observed flux density ratio between 1700 and 800 .",

    "it is difficult to measure the lyc escape fraction based on one galaxy at @xmath63 accurately due to the uncertainties of the intrinsic luminosity ratio , @xmath61 and igm opacity , @xmath62 .",
    "first , the intrinsic @xmath61 ratio is very sensitive to galaxy star formation history and galaxy age @xcite .",
    "we find the intrinsic @xmath68 based on the galaxy star formation history and galaxy age derived in section  [ stellar_population ] . to study how the intrinsic @xmath61 ratio changes with star formation history , we also fit the broadband sed with the stellar synthesis models with the exponential declined sfr history ( @xmath69 ) by changing @xmath70 from 0.1  gyr to 1  gyr .",
    "we find that the exponential declined sfr history usually results in a younger galaxy age ( e.g. , @xmath71  myr for @xmath72  gyr ) , and the intrinsic @xmath61 ratio can be as low as 3.5 .",
    "second , it is impossible to determine the igm opacity for a given random light of sight .",
    "we carry out a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of igm absorption . we simulate absorption systems in 10,000 lines of sight .",
    "these absorption systems follow the distributions of neutral hydrogen column density , redshift , and doppler velocity in @xcite .",

    "the a2218-flanking a component is well detected in the f275w image .",
    "we find that the a2218-flanking a in the f275w image elongates to the same direction of that in the f606w image .",
    "this similarity of the morphology in the f275w and f606w images indicates that the f275w flux is not from the foreground interlopers .",
    "unfortunately , the f275w image is not deep enough to carry out a detailed morphology analysis for the diffuse part of the galaxy .",

    "we study a bright knot on the right ( west ) side of the a component ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) , which is well detected in both f275w and f606w images .",
    "we measure the f275w and f606w flux density from the bright knot and find that @xmath78jy , @xmath79jy , which leads to @xmath80 .",
    "this @xmath9 ratio is significantly lower than those found in the total of the lensed galaxy and a component , which suggests that the region with higher sfr surface density has a higher escape fraction .",
    "it is essential to establish the relation between the lyc escape fraction and galaxy properties .",
    "this relation is crucial to predicting the lyc escape fraction of galaxies at the epoch of reionization , which can not be directly measured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on the confirmed lyc leaking galaxies at both low and high redshifts , studies try to connect the lyc escape fraction to varieties of galaxy properties , including dust extinction ( reddening ) , interstellar absorption lines , ly@xmath45 emission lines , the flux ratios between [ ] @xmath814959,5007 and [ ] @xmath823727 , specific sfr ( ssfr@xmath83 ) , sfr surface density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "actually , the above galaxy properties are highly correlated .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the ionization parameter ( i.e. , [ ] @xmath814959,5007/[]@xmath823727 ) increases significantly with increasing ssfrs and decreasing galaxy sizes in star - forming galaxies , and this trend may become stronger for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to understand the physical process behind these galaxy physical properties that regulates the lyc escape process in galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggested that the extreme feedback caused by the high sfr surface density plays an important role in creating channels in the interstellar medium and enabling ionizing photons to escape from galaxies .",
    "@xcite did find a strong correlation between the lyc escape fraction and sfr surface density in low - redshift lyc emitters .",
    "this trend is consistent with our finding that a higher escape fraction is associated with the region with a higher sfr surface density in a2218-flanking .",
    "we compare the sfr surface density in a2218-flanking with those in the other six lensed galaxies in this hst program .",
    "we find that the sfr surface densities are comparable in these seven galaxies ( @xmath84  @xmath85  yr@xmath4  kpc@xmath86 ) .",
    "however , only a2218-flanking has a high lyc escape fraction , and we do not detect significant lyc flux in the remaining six galaxies , suggesting that the lyc escape is less than 5% , assuming an average igm optical depth for a given redshift .",
    "it is quite unlikely that the igm transmission is an order of magnitude lower than average in all six galaxies .",
    "this piece of evidence suggests that , besides sfr surface density , there are also other properties regulating the lyc escape fraction .",
    "one unique property of a2218-flanking is that it has an order of magnitude lower stellar mass compared to the rest of six galaxies @xcite .",
    "as it is suggested in the cosmological zoom - in simulations , the lyc escape fraction is higher in lower - mass dark matter halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which presumably host galaxies with lower stellar mass .",
    "it is worth noting that we can not draw exclusive conclusions based on this small sample of galaxies because of the large systematic uncertainties of the @xmath87 ratio and the unknown igm optical depth for a random line of sight .",
    "furthermore , the escape fraction may also depend on viewing angles , i.e. , the ionizing radiation may be able to escape from galaxies only in some preferential directions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , a large sample ( @xmath88 ) of the galaxies is required to study how the lyc escape fraction changes with galaxy properties .",
    "in this letter , we report a large lyman continuum escape fraction ( @xmath89 ) in a compact dwarf galaxy , a2218-flanking .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we carried out deep hst / wfc3 f275w uv imaging observations on a2218-flanking .",
    "the f275w band covers the lyman continuum emission at @xmath6 .",

    "3 .   we find that the region with a higher sfr surface density has a significantly lower @xmath9 ratio , suggesting a higher lyc escape in this region .",
    "this suggests that sfr surface density plays an important role in regulating the lyc escape fraction .",
    "4 .   by comparing a2218-flanking with other galaxies in this hst program without lyc flux detections ,",
