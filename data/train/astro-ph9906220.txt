    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have recently assumed an elite status at the top rung of the cosmic distance ladder .",
    "comprehensive studies of sne ia have established their general spectroscopic and photometric homogeneity , along with quantifiable diversity .",
    "sne ia make reasonably good standard candles ( kowal 1968 ; sandage & tammann 1993 ; branch & miller 1993 ) and excellent calibrated candles ( phillips 1993 ; hamuy et al .",

    "the downside is that sne ia are rare and fleeting , making them more challenging to study than other astronomical distance indicators .",
    "nevertheless , recent applications of these `` standard bombs '' have been numerous . within a few hundred mpc",
    ", they have been used to measure the expansion of the universe : with recession velocities of their host galaxies and distances to individual sne ia , the hubble law has been tested to redshifts @xmath7 at high precision ( hamuy et al . 1996b ; riess , press , & kirshner 1996a ; tammann 1998 ) .",
    "sne ia have also been used to measure peculiar motions of galaxies and large scale flows ( tammann & leibundgut 1990 ; miller & branch 1992 ; jerjen & tammann 1993 ; riess , press , & kirshner 1995b ; riess et al .",

    "sne ia serve as standard clocks : cosmological time dilation has been demonstrated by comparing light curves of distant supernovae with light curves from those nearby ( leibundgut et al .",
    "1996 ; goldhaber et al .",
    "1997 ) , as well as from the relative rates of spectral evolution ( riess et al .",
    "most recently , sne ia have been used to measure luminosity distances at high redshift ( @xmath8 ) , from which the geometry and expansion history of the universe can be determined ( n@xmath9rgaard - nielsen et al . 1989 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1995 ; schmidt et al .",
    "these measurements have likely tolled the death knell of standard ( @xmath10 ) cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology , strongly disfavoring the possibility of enough gravitating matter to flatten the universe ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ; garnavich et al .",
    "even more surprisingly , preliminary indications show that the expansion is accelerating at the current epoch ( riess et al .",
    "1998a ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) , inconsistent with the idea that ordinary matter is the dominant component of the universe s energy density .",
    "alternatives such as a cosmological constant , or other forms of energy density similar to it , seem to be favored ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998b ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) . combined with constraints from the cosmic microwave background anisotropy power spectrum ,",
    "the supernovae have also given preliminary indications for a universe with zero global curvature ( garnavich et al .",

    "these studies rely on sne ia only as bright , precise , _ relative _ distance indicators . however , the determination of the expansion rate of the universe , the hubble constant , and the age of the universe require an accurate _ absolute _ distance scale . measuring absolute distances to sne ia requires calibrating them through objects on lower rungs of the distance ladder .",
    "the best distance indicator for this remains what it has been since the days of hubble himself : @xmath11 cephei variable stars .",
    "cepheids are bright enough to be studied in nearby galaxies , including those which have hosted sne ia .",
    "in addition they can be found in significant numbers , which allows for a precise mean period - luminosity ( pl ) relation to be constructed and compared to nearby samples . in general cepheids in external galaxies",
    "are compared to cepheids in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , whose distance is calibrated through a variety of means ( not always with the same result , cf .",
    "section [ sectlmcdist ] ) .",
    "the importance of cepheids to calibrate secondary distance indicators ( including sne ia ) prompted the creation of the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "1997 , and references therein ) . at present the use of sne ia to measure the hubble constant",
    "is limited by the paucity of local calibrators , not by the number or precision of distances to objects in the hubble flow .",
    "nature has been kind by providing us with sn 1998bu in the leo i group galaxy m96 ( ngc 3368 ) , for which a cepheid distance had already been obtained with _ hst _ by a third group , tanvir et al .",

    "4 we combine the properties of sn 1998bu with other cepheid - calibrated sne ia and sne ia in the hubble flow to determine the hubble constant ( @xmath12 ) and its statistical uncertainty . we discuss our results , sources of systematic error , and implications for the age of the universe , @xmath13 , in  5 . finally , we conclude and summarize in  6 .",
    "independent observations and analysis of sn 1998bu have been performed by suntzeff et al .",

    "well - measured light curves are the key to sn ia distances , so we undertook extensive photometric observations in the @xmath17 passbands .",
    "the plurality of our optical photometric observations ( 29 nights ) was obtained with the flwo 1.2-m telescope + `` 4shooter '' ccd mosaic camera ( szentgyorgyi et al .",
    "the 4shooter consists of a 2x2 array of thinned , back - side illuminated , anti - reflective coated loral @xmath18 ccd detectors , situated at the f/8 cassegrain focus .",
    "the pixel size is 15 , yielding a scale of @xmath19 per pixel at the focal plane and a field of view of approximately @xmath20 on a side for each chip , with total sky coverage of 0.15 deg@xmath21 .",
    "our observations were taken in a 2x2 binned mode , so that the resulting images were sampled at @xmath22 per pixel , well matched to the typical seeing ( 15-@xmath23 fwhm ) achieved at this telescope .",
    "all observations of sn 1998bu with the mosaic were made on the same ccd ( chip 1 ) , which has the best combination of cosmetic characteristics and quantum efficiency .",
    "two nights of observations were obtained on this telescope with the `` andycam '' instrument , a ccd camera with a single ccd , very similar to those that make up the 4shooter .",
    "both instruments have good ultraviolet and near - infrared response , which enabled us to make observations in the johnson @xmath24 and kron - cousins @xmath25 bandpasses .",
    "our optical filters are constructed from schott glass components , as recommended by bessell ( 1990 ) for coated ccds .",
    "the flwo @xmath26 filter prescriptions are described by riess et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; in general they match well the prescriptions of bessell ( 1990 ) , though the flwo @xmath27 filter extends to somewhat longer wavelengths .",
    "the flwo @xmath28 filter transmission is also a good match to the bessell ( 1990 ) ux specification .",
    "our flwo 1.2-m observations of sn 1998bu are part of an ongoing supernova monitoring program at cfa .",
    "supernova observations are not well suited to the scheduled time allocation procedure that is typical at most telescopes .",
    "to follow supernovae , the time allocation committee authorizes us to enlist the generous aid of the scheduled observers , asking them to devote a small fraction of observing time ( usually limited to @xmath29 minutes per night ) to the sn program .",
    "we complement the monitoring observations with scheduled nights ( usually one night per month ) to measure fainter objects and perform photometric calibrations .",
    "we have been quite successful observing in this mode ; a set of 22 sne ia light curves garnered as a result of this program has been presented by riess et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "the flwo 1.2-m is equipped with an infrared instrument during bright time , which provides useful ir supernova data ( obtained in a similar observing mode ) , at the price of bright - time gaps in our optical light curves .",
    "for this object we made a special effort to minimize these gaps by inviting observers at other institutions to participate .",

    "the detectors used in these observations were not as blue - sensitive as the others , so only @xmath26 images were taken .",
    "our observations of sn 1998bu continued until july 2 when it was too close to the setting sun to provide good photometric data . in total our optical photometric data set",
    "consists of 327 measurements of sn 1998bu .",
    "all ccd observations were reduced ( uniformly , beginning with the raw data ) in the standard fashion , with bias subtraction , dark current subtraction ( not necessary in most cases ) and flat - field correction using the iraf ccdproc package .",

    "this procedure was quite effective in the majority of cases .",
    "however , supernova photometry requires special care .",
    "where the color terms are large ( due to a mismatch between the filter / detector response and a standard landolt response ) , the use of a linear color correction can be insufficient .",
    "this problem is especially acute in supernova photometry because of deep , wide features in the spectra of supernovae .",
    "even when a large color correction works well when applied to stars ( i.e. , yields very small differences with standard magnitudes ) , such large corrections may not be appropriate to supernovae . in most cases ,",
    "filters were well - matched and the derived color corrections were small , so nothing more complicated was required . however , in two data sets ( the gettysburg and wellesley @xmath0 filters ) , the color - corrected supernova magnitudes were significantly discrepant with other data . in both of these cases the color terms were quite large . to combat this problem , we determined a correction based on the @xmath0 filter transmission and detector sensitivity functions from these two sites .",
    "we used these response functions with spectrophotometric observations of a number of sne ia at varying ages , and determined magnitude corrections relative to the standard passband defined by bessell ( 1990 ) .",
    "this procedure mirrors the use of k - corrections for high - redshift supernovae ( kim , goobar , & perlmutter 1996 ; schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) . combining these corrections ( usually @xmath41 to @xmath42 mag ) with zero points determined from",
    "the comparison stars brought these two data sets into good accord with the others , though the photometry has signficantly higher uncertainty ( typically @xmath43 mag ) .",
    "in addition , we encountered a puzzle in the mdm @xmath44-band data , which was discrepantly bright ( by @xmath41 mag ) compared to data from four other telescopes at nearly the same epoch .",
    "however , in this case , the derived @xmath44 color term was not very large .",
    "we were unable to procure the filter and detector characteristics for this data set .",
    "thus we can not provide an adequate explanation for this anomaly ; it is possible that the filter transmission is mismatched just such that a color term derived from stellar observations ( which were somewhat limited in color ) would be small ( e.g. , high transmission at some wavelengths compensated by low transmission at others ) , while the supernova spectrum at the epoch of the observations led to a discrepant magnitude . since four other telescopes provided mutually consistent observations at the same epoch , we have disregarded the mdm @xmath44 data .",
    "we were fortunate to possess contemporaneous observations so that we could discover this discrepancy , and it illustrates the need for a careful investigation of filter and detector characteristics when combining observations of supernovae made at various sites ( suntzeff et al .",
    "1999 ; wells et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "a futher complication in supernova photometry is proper discrimination between light from the supernova and light from the underlying galaxy ( boisseau & wheeler 1991 ) .",
    "accurate subtraction of the galaxy background is essential to measure correct magnitudes , and even more important in measuring light curves , as a constant unremoved galaxy background will cause a supernova light curve to look more shallow ( i.e. , mimic a slower decline rate ) .",
    "though sn 1998bu is projected on a spiral arm of m96 , the background from the galaxy is relatively faint . we were fortunate to possess @xmath30 images of m96 prior to the appearance of sn 1998bu , taken with the flwo 1.2-m for another program .",

    "sample differences between the hubble - flow and calibrating sne ia are one potential source of systematic uncertainty at this level .",
    "the present sample is necessarily imperfect ; one difference occurs due to the host - galaxy type : our hubble - flow sample includes supernovae in both early - type and late - type hosts , while hosts of the local calibrators have cepheid distances , and thus are of late - type only .",

    "we only consider sne ia which have photoelectrically measured multicolor light curves .",
    "as our observations of sn 1998bu have shown , even ccd data measured and calibrated similarly can yield discrepant photometry depending on the details of the telescope , detector , and filters .",
    "such calibration problems , as well as problems of galaxy background subtraction and transformation to the landolt system , make photographic photometry of supernovae subject to systematic differences in the peak brightness , colors , and the light curve shape .",
    "the last point is crucial ; we must be certain that the observed light curve shape is an intrinsic property of the supernova , and not an artifact of systematic errors resulting from photographic photometry ( boisseau & wheeler 1991 ; pierce & jacoby 1995 ) . while heroic efforts ( e.g. , schaefer 1998 and references therein ) have been made in compiling and reanalyzing older photographic ( and even visual ) light curves , the best path to the hubble constant lies along another route : precise distances to well - observed objects .",
    "the drawback to a high standard for the data is that our calibrating sample is small , consisting of four sne ia : sn 1998bu , sn 1990n , sn 1981b and sn 1972e .",
    "we pay in random error what we avoid in systematic bias and we believe this to be a good bargain .",
    "the cepheid distances to the host galaxies of these four supernovae have been measured by two _ hst _ programs , but the general approach among all the _ hst _ cepheid programs is the same . from the derived mean magnitudes of the cepheids and a @xmath175 relation ( madore & freedman 1991 ) , distance moduli ( relative to the lmc ) can be determined .",
    "the two - color photometry allows for an estimate of the extinction , either on a cepheid - by - cepheid basis or in the mean , yielding an extinction - corrected distance modulus for the host galaxy .",
    "it is important to use distance moduli for the host galaxies which are derived consistently ( e.g. , always using the same @xmath175 relation , the same lmc distance modulus , the same extinction prescription , etc . ) so that each supernova is on an equal footing .",
    "thus we have not simply used the final distance modulus quoted in the cepheid papers , but rather have tried to extract as uniform a set of distance moduli as we can with limited information .",
    "this approach also allows us to more easily consider systematic effects in the cepheid distances .",
    "for instance , in this section we use distance moduli with the lmc distance fixed at @xmath176 mag ( hereafter , all distance moduli will have implied units of magnitudes ) .",
    "we _ do not _ yet include the uncertainty in this value because that uncertainty is implicit in each host galaxy distance , and moreover it is perfectly correlated , such that the derived mean absolute magnitudes will suffer the same uncertainty .",

    ", they use seven sne ia in six galaxies with five cepheid distances ( the distance to sn 1989b was estimated by association to other leo group galaxies with measured cepheid distances ; see their table 6 ) .",
    "their local calibrator sample is _ not _ selected by the same criteria as their fiducial sample , as no color constraint was applied to the local calibrators .",
    "so sn 1895b was used with an estimated @xmath228 but no color information , and sn 1989b was used though it was too red , with @xmath229 mag ( wells et al .",
    "( sn 1998bu would also be too red to meet the color requirement of their fiducial sample . ) nevertheless , excluding sn 1895b and 1989b from their analysis would only have a small effect and would increase their derived @xmath12 by about 1 @xmath230 .",
    "though we have not used sn 1895b and sn 1989b in our local sample for reasons adduced earlier , there are additional differences between the two analyses .",
    "saha et al .",
    "( 1997 ) include no correction for variation in intrinsic sn ia luminosity based on light curve shape .",
    "this is particularly significant for the calibrator sample where 3 out of the 4 objects are slow decliners ; including this correction makes the estimated fiducial absolute peak magnitude slightly fainter and explains about half our disagreement in @xmath12 .",
    "most of the balance of the difference likely arises from the treatment of extinction . while saha et al .",
    "( 1997 ) correct some of their local calibrator peak magnitudes for extinction individually , they do not apply an extinction correction to their fiducial sample sne . if the mean color excess of their fiducial sample were as little as @xmath231 mag , correcting for extinction would increase the mean @xmath232 by @xmath41 mag , and raise @xmath143 by @xmath40 , which is the other half of the difference in @xmath12 .",
    "saha et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argue that selection effects against the discovery of extinguished distant supernovae preclude a significant amount of extinction in the fiducial sample .",
    "while this _ could be _ true , there is no demonstration that it _ is _ true for the sample they use .",
    "the selection effects in the several searches that led to the sne ia of their fiducial sample are quite complicated ( see , e.g. hamuy & pinto 1999 ) , and _",
    "a priori _ statements about the possible extinction distribution of the distant supernovae are not , by themselves , evidence .",
    "in particular , discovery of sne ia with @xmath233 mag does not seem to be strongly suppressed . in figure [ figav ]",
    "we show the extinction distribution for our hubble - flow and calibrating samples and it is clear that a some of the supernovae found this way are , in fact , signifcantly extinguished .",
    "the mlcs analysis was designed to address these concerns ; the supernova peak magnitude , extinction and luminosity correction are quantitatively estimated for each object , with a careful attention to correlations and the final distance modulus uncertainty .",
    "this obviates the need to make arbitrary sample cuts .",
    "we have taken particular care to analyze the local calibrators and the hubble - flow sne ia by the same methods .",
    "while these technical differences are significant , the difference in the derived hubble constant between our approach and others is small .",
    "uncertainty in the true hubble constant still arises principally from the small size of the calibrator sample and from uncertainties in the lower rungs of the distance ladder .",
    "we examine three sources of systematic uncertainty in the distances of the galaxies that host the calibrating sne ia : the effect of metallicity on _ hst _ cepheid distance moduli , recalibration of the cepheid @xmath175 relation , and the distance to the lmc , which are likely to be the most important sources of systematic error .",
    "the remarkably tight @xmath175 relation of cepheids in the lmc is quite a boon to distance measurement , but also calls for understanding variation in the @xmath175 ( and therefore derived distance moduli ) with environment .",
    "metallicity , in particular , may play an important role .",
    "theoretical studies of cepheid pulsation ( e.g. , chiosi , wood , & capitanio 1993 ) indicate metallicity can have an effect on the brightness and colors of cepheids , though the size of this effect is uncertain .",
    "if the brightness and colors of cepheids vary with metallicity , their distances will be misestimated , both because of an incorrect estimate of their intrinsic brightness as well as an incorrect estimate of the extinction based on the color excess .",
    "systematic errors in distances would occur in cepheid populations with significantly different mean abundances than the lmc .    while it is important to understand the effects of metallicity on cepheid luminosities and colors in many wavebands ( see , e.g.",
    ", freedman & madore 1990 ; gould 1994 ; stift 1995 ) , our particular concern is the effect on the _ hst _ cepheid distances .",
    "recently great efforts have been made to determine empirically the relation between metallicity and distance moduli measured in @xmath59 and @xmath27 with the standard procedure of extinction correction .",

    "a global analysis of many galactic and extragalactic cepheids by kochanek ( 1997 ) yielded a similar metallicity dependence ; we consider this analysis in more detail in the next section .    to assess the possible impact of metal abundance on the hubble constant from sne ia , we have recalculated the distance moduli to the calibrating galaxies with these empirically determined metallicity corrections .",

    "low @xmath12 values from sne ia are not due to metallicity effects on the cepheid distances to this sample of galaxies .",
    "this is primarily due to our inclusion of sn 1998bu in ngc 3368 , which is the only metal - rich calibrator , by a factor of 0.7 dex compared to the lmc .",

    "( 1995 ) and our observations do not require a faint value .",
    "more strikingly , comparing sn 1998bu and sn 1972e we see that the estimates of @xmath152 are almost exactly the same without a metallicity correction , even though the metal abundance is higher in ngc 3368 than in ngc 5253 by more than a factor 10 .    as a result , including a metallicity correction increases the dispersion in the estimates of @xmath152 from the four calibrating sne ia , from @xmath260 mag with no metallicity correction , to @xmath261 mag for the kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) value , to @xmath262 mag for the sasselov et al .",

    "the sample size of four is probably too small to place much confidence in this result , but if it were borne out by a larger sample , it would have interesting implications . assuming that the intrinsic dispersion in the mlcs - corrected luminosity for the calibrating supernovae is the same as that for the hubble - flow sne ia ( @xmath263 mag ) ,",
    "any increase in the dispersion would arise from the cepheid distance moduli .",
    "a significant increase in dispersion with a metallicity correction would imply either that the association between region metallicity and cepheid metallicity is not straightforward , that the metallicity correction was incorrect , or that some other systematic uncertainty ( perhaps in the properties of sne in regions of different metallicity ) was colluding with the metallicity to counter its effect in the uncorrected distance moduli . increasing the sample of sne ia in galaxies with cepheid distances ( particularly covering a wide range of metallicity ) would be a very desirable path to understanding this important uncertainty in the distance scale .",
    "we note that nevalainen & roos ( 1998 ) used this idea of `` statistical consistency '' between cepheid - calibrated distance indicators ( including sne ia ) to derive a metallicity dependence which brought the estimates of @xmath12 into the best concordance , @xmath264 . because of the high metallicity of ngc 3368 , including sn 1998bu in their analysis would likely affect this result .    in principle",
    "the supernovae themselves can provide an estimate of the metallicity correction , but minimizing the dispersion in our four calibrating supernovae yields @xmath265 , which is only a weak constraint given the very small sample size .",
    "in addition , such a procedure ignores a possibly significant metallicity dependence in the brightness of the supernovae themselves .",
    "thus the current supernova data do not provide strong evidence either for or against the incorporation of a metallicity dependence in the cepheid distance moduli .",
    "we take the results at face value , and combined with the current best estimates of @xmath266 we conclude that the systematic @xmath267 error in @xmath12 from metallicity considerations for this sample is small , @xmath268 .      we ( and most authors ) have adopted the @xmath59-band and @xmath27-band @xmath175 relations derived from lmc cepheids by madore & freedman ( 1991 ) .",
    "the relations are consistent with earlier estimates ( e.g. , sandage & tammann 1968 ; feast & walker 1987 ) , but are based on a relatively small sample of objects compared to the number now known in more distant galaxies .",
    "an error in the @xmath175 slope or zero - point could be an important source of systematic uncertainty . in this section , by the zero - point we do not mean to include the uncertainty in the distance to the lmc ( still adopted as @xmath269 , and discussed extensively in the next section ) , but only uncertainty in the zero - point that arises from a small sample of lmc cepheids , even after assuming the lmc distance is perfectly known .",
    "the madore & freedman ( 1991 ) @xmath175 relations have statistical zero - point uncertainties of 0.05 and 0.03 mag in @xmath59 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "unfortunately , residuals for the fit to the @xmath175 relations are correlated , and the @xmath175 slope is also slightly correlated to the zero point , so that the real uncertainty in the application of the @xmath175 relations is not just a straightforward quadrature combination of these uncertainties .",
    "tanvir ( 1996 ) analyzed an augmented sample of lmc cepheids with particular attention to correlated residuals and found a slightly tighter relation .",
    "however , his result indicated bias in the madore & freedman ( 1991 ) calibration such that for typical period distributions , _ hst _ cepheid distance moduli are overestimated by @xmath41 mag , which would imply an increase in our estimate of @xmath152 ( to fainter intrinsic luminosity ) by the same amount and a @xmath270 increase in @xmath12 for any given lmc distance .",
    "the global analysis of kochanek ( 1997 ) carefully and consistently treats the cepheid data to allow for distance estimates including the systematic uncertainties we have discussed so far .",
    "again , the distance to the lmc is fixed at @xmath271 . in table [ tabkoch ] we present our estimates of @xmath152 given the distance moduli derived by kochanek ( 1997 ) and presented in his table 3 .",
    "we have added 0.05 mag to the ngc 3368 distance modului presented there to correct for the wfpc2 `` long / short '' exposure effect , which was not included in his analysis of the cepheids in that galaxy ( this is just a first approximation ; the correct method would be to repeat his analysis with the fainter ngc 3368 cepheid magnitudes ) . with that caveat ,",
    "we have considered two of his models , the first being model 0 which derives distances in the `` standard '' method , with a global solution for the @xmath175 relation and correct treatment of correlated errors .",
    "as table [ tabkoch ] shows , the @xmath152 estimates are generally fainter in this model , in line with the suggestion of tanvir ( 1996 ) , leading to a modest increase in @xmath12 .",
    "the second model we consider is model 3 - 15 , which also derives a global solution , but further allows for effects of metallicity and positive extinction .",
    "the result is again generally to decrease the host galaxy distances , and lead to a fainter @xmath152 and higher @xmath12 .",
    "however , we note that the estimates of @xmath152 are not consistent with their uncertainties ( which are derived from the quadrature sum of the uncertainty in @xmath272 from mlcs and the uncertainty in the cepheid distance modulus ) .",
    "furthermore , the dispersion is much larger than the @xmath273 mag expected from the sne ia alone ; this implies that either the local calibrating sne ia are very different from the hubble - flow sne ia ( a possibility we feel is unlikely based on their spectra and light curves ) , or that systematic errors remain in the cepheid distances derived from this particular model .",
    "further analysis is required .",

    "( the resulting uncertainty in @xmath152 is in the opposite sense , @xmath287 mag . )",
    "since definitive results regarding the exact magnitude of these effects are lacking , we just include these effects in our uncertainty , with @xmath288 .",
    "our estimate of the hubble constant then becomes @xmath289      the final source of systematic error in the hubble constant that we consider is the distance to the lmc .",
    "all methods to measure @xmath12 which are based on _ hst _ cepheid distances share this systematic uncertainty , so that comparisons in the resulting @xmath12 values between these methods should not include an error component from the lmc distance ( i.e. , comparisons of _ hst _ cepheid - calibrated @xmath12 measurements should be to the analog of equation [ eqnh0sys ] ; if two such measurements disagree , they will disagree regardless of the lmc distance ) .",

    "measurement of quantities derived from the `` true '' hubble constant , such as the dynamical age of the universe , also requires such an estimate .",

    "if we modify the analysis so that each distance method only gets one `` vote '' to reduce correlated errors , the pdf becomes quite asymmetric with @xmath298 , where the stated value is the peak of the pdf and the upper and lower uncertainties are derived from the points at which the cumulative probability is 0.841 and 0.159 .",
    "this analysis does not provide a reason for the discrepant values , and is subject to additional correlated errors that may still be lurking .",

    "we have used mlcs to analyze the photoelectric light curve of sn 1967c ( de vaucouleurs 1968 ) , and conclude that ngc 3389 is at @xmath313 , placing it significantly farther away than the other leo i group galaxies .",
