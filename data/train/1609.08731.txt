    "synchronization phenomena have been intensely studied for decades , in part because of the roles such phenomena play in chemical systems , laser arrays , cellular biology models , and neural networks to name just a few ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for extensive reviews ) .",
    "one of the most extensively studied models is that proposed by kuramoto in 1975  @xcite , a model that has become paradigmatic for the description of many synchronization phenomena .",
    "originally the model was applied to an interacting population of oscillators with randomly distributed frequencies .",
    "when the interaction is sufficiently strong , most of the units in the array synchronize their dynamics to a single frequency which may differ from the natural frequency of any one of the synchronized oscillators , and also to equal phases .",
    "many variants of the original model have been introduced over the years to study different effects in different physical and biological systems , too many to list here ( for an extensive review , see ref .",
    "we specifically mention the inclusion of fluctuations , because of their central role in our studies .",
    "noise leads to disorder , so in the presence of noise the interactions that in its absence may be strong enough to lead to frequency or to phase synchronization must in general be stronger for synchronization to occur . in all of these models ,",
    "the form and range of the interactions has varied greatly in the literature .    beyond the kuramoto model ,",
    "many different models for synchronization have been proposed , ranging from arrays of continuous oscillatory and excitable units to discrete models .",
    "for instance , over the past decade coupled maps have attracted a great deal of attention  @xcite .",
    "recently , arrays of coupled stochastic units each with a discrete set of states but , in contrast with maps , with continuous time have increased in popularity as a simpler paradigm for synchronization  @xcite .",
    "even though these discrete - state oscillator models may be motivated by discrete processes ( for example , protein degradation  @xcite ) , it has been claimed that they can also be used to model a coarse - grained phase space of continuous noisy oscillators .",
    "for instance , prager et al .",
    "@xcite established a link between a globally coupled ensemble of excitable units described by the fitzhugh - nagumo equations with additive white noise , and a coupled array of 3-state non - markovian stochastic oscillators .",
    "our own work has focused on arrays of 2-state and of 3-state stochastic oscillators .",
    "the transitions between the states of individual units are governed by a rate process .",
    "this rate process might be markovian  @xcite or might involve distributed delays ( such as , for instance , a refractory period )  @xcite .",
    "interactions among units in our model appear as a dependence of the transition rates of a particular unit on the states of the other units to which it is coupled .",
    "the goal of the work presented herein is to address the following two questions : ( 1 ) under what conditions can we describe the dynamics of kuramoto - like coupled noisy oscillators as periodic continuous - time markov chains ?",
    "in other words , when can we model continuous - phase stochastic dynamics as discrete - phase models in which the transitions between the discrete states are governed by memoryless rate processes ? ( 2 ) is there a lower limit to the discretization of the continous noisy oscillators ?",
    "in other words , how many discrete states are necessary to capture the essential synchronization features of the continuous system ?",
    "the popularity of three - state models leads us to explore whether the synchronization properties of coupled three - state markovian units in any way capture those of the continuous oscillator system .",
    "to arrive at some answers to these questions , in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] we present the continuous phase model that is the starting point of our analysis .",
    "it is an array of kuramato - like oscillators with additive noise and a generalized nonlinear interaction .",
    "we start with the full amplitude equations , but will always work in the limit where the phase equations alone provide a valid description of the important dynamics . for",
    "the sake of simplicity we consider a globally coupled ensemble of identical oscillators ( all with the same natural frequency ) , and thus focus on the phase synchronization phenomenon . in sec .",
    "[ sec : coarsegraining ] we perform the coarse - graining of the phase space and discuss the conditions under which the dynamics can be modeled as a periodic markov chain .",
    "here we also discuss the questions associated with the three - state systems . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we present our concluding remarks .",
    "we also include two appendices with technical details of our calculations .",
    "our starting point is an ensemble of @xmath0 identical noisy oscillators described by the complex time - dependent dimensionless amplitudes @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "these amplitudes are governed by the equations of motion @xmath3 the overdot indicates a derivative with respect to time .",
    "@xmath4 is a real positive parameter that governs the internal dynamics of each oscillator . for the function @xmath5 , which describes this internal dynamics ,",
    "we take the normal form of a supercritical hopf bifurcation , @xmath6 for simplicity , we take all parameters to be real and have scaled out irrelevant constants .",
    "the oscillators are identical , and we have removed the natural frequency of oscillation of each unit , that is , we are working in a moving framework . in the usual language of the kuramoto model ,",
    "the frequency distribution of the oscillators is @xmath7 , where the @xmath8-function is appropriate for the continuous variable @xmath9 ( and below also for the continuous time @xmath10 ) .",
    "therefore , the internal dynamics of each oscillator tends to set @xmath11 , with an arbitrary phase .    the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ amplitudeosc ] ) accounts for the interaction between the oscillators .",
    "the coupling strength is quantified by @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction is assumed to be global ( all - to - all interaction ) , with the customary kuramoto order parameter given by the average amplitude as a function of time , @xmath13 the original kuramoto model @xcite is recovered if we set @xmath14 equal to @xmath15 , so that the global interaction is given by @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath17 accounts for a nonlinear interaction between the oscillators via @xmath18 .",
    "the advantage of including a general nonlinear function @xmath17 in the interaction will be clear when we subsequently perform the coarse - graining operations .    the third term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ amplitudeosc ] ) is a complex additive noise of intensity @xmath19 .",
    "this term models the fluctuations .",
    "the noise is of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent real gaussian white noises of zero mean and correlation functions @xmath23 @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the kronecker delta appropriate for the discrete variable @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the form of eq .",
    "( [ amplitudeosc ] ) respects the phase invariance , that is , the equation is invariant under the transformation @xmath27 with @xmath28 constant , but the equation is otherwise quite general .",
    "we consider the parameter range @xmath29 and @xmath30 , so that the time scale of the internal dynamics of each oscillator dominates over ( i.e. is shorter than ) that of the interactions between the oscillators .",
    "then , after a fast transient defined by the internal dynamics , we have that @xmath31 .",
    "after that , the phase of each oscillator varies as a function of time on a slower time scale defined by the interactions ( albeit with very rapid fluctuations ) . on this longer time scale",
    "we can write @xmath32 .",
    "the dynamics specified by eq .",

    "the stochastic phase equation ( [ phaseosc ] ) ( which is an equation of the langevin form ) can be replaced by a nonlinear fokker - planck equation ( see ref .",

    "the desynchronized state corresponds to a uniform distribution of phases , @xmath53 this choice obeys the normalization condition @xmath54 the dynamics described by the phase equation ( [ phaseosc ] ) contains two competing trends : the fluctuations , which tend to desynchronize the system and stabilize the state described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : desync ] ) , and the attractive interactions that tend to synchronize the system . when the coupling strength is weaker than a critical value ( @xmath55 ) , the desynchronized state is stable , while an interaction stronger than this critical value ( @xmath56 ) destabilizes the desynchronized state , leading to a phase transition to synchronization",
    ". calculations of the critical point have been widely documented in the literature  @xcite , and we see no point in repeating them here .",
    "instead , here we consider the continuous limit of the coarse - graining procedure presented in sec .",

    "the occurrence of self - organization is characterized by a non - vanishing order parameter .",
    "near the critical point ( [ criticalk-1 ] ) , the mean - field evolution of the order parameter can be approached via the normal form ( see refs.@xcite and appendix b ) @xmath59 with @xmath60 where @xmath61 . for the original kuramoto model @xcite , @xmath62 ,",
    "the transition to synchronization is always supercritical because @xmath63 .",

    "the function @xmath64 affects the critical coupling strength in eq .",
    "( [ criticalk-1 ] ) simply as a renormalization of this critical value .",
    "the main role of @xmath64 is to increase or decrease the dispersion of the phases around a common value in the synchronized regime .",
    "the qualitative effect of including the function @xmath17 can be seen in the interaction term in the phase equation ( [ phaseosc ] ) . in the synchronized phase a function @xmath64 that increases with increasing @xmath66 increases the attractive interactions among the oscillators , leading to a decrease of the dispersion of phases around a common value .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath64 decreases with increasing @xmath66 , this tendency will be weakened and , since fluctuations lead to a greater dispersion of the phases , the synchronization will be coarser . a decreasing function might thus be a better candidate for a successful increasingly coarse coarse - graining procedure .",
    "+    for numerical simulations we must choose a particular form for the function @xmath64 . as stated above , our goal of coarse - graining the phase space is better achieved if we choose a decreasing function of @xmath66 .",
    "we have tested a number of different functions and have determined that the particular form and parameters in it are not as important as is simply the choice of almost any decreasing function of @xmath66 .",

    "we have chosen a coupling strength @xmath73 ( see caption ) so that the array of oscillators is in the synchronized regime .",
    "the system exhibits coarse phase clustering , that is , the synchronization is not perfect .",
    "this is attributed to the fluctuations that tend to disperse the phases , and to the rapid decrease of the function ( [ fmodel-1 ] ) .",
