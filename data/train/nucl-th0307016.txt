    "the study of properties of exotic nuclei , in particular the structure of nuclei far from the @xmath0-stability line , has recently attracted wide interest both experimentally and theoretically . in those nuclei ,",
    "the presence of nucleons , which have separation energies appreciably smaller than those in @xmath1-stable nuclei and have a far extending nucleon distribution , leads to various interesting physical phenomena . due to the closeness of the fermi surface to the particle continuum in exotic nuclei the coupling between bound states and the continuum become important .",
    "the description of exotic nuclei has to explicitly include the coupling between bound states and the continuum .",
    "there exist several extensive studies of exotic nuclei in relativistic and non - relativistic microscopic approaches@xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of those models is how to properly treat the pairing correlations which have an important influence on physical properties in exotic nuclei . in general , pairing correlations in open shell nuclei can be treated by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory or through the bogoliubov transformation@xcite .",
    "the main feature of the bogoliubov transformation , compared with the simple bcs theory , is that the hartree - fock equation or dirac equation and the gap equations are solved simultaneously with self - consistent fields .",
    "both of them could give a good description of the pairing correlation if the nucleus is not too far away from the @xmath0-stable line@xcite .",
    "the simple bcs method may not be reliable near the drip line because the continuous states were not correctly treated@xcite .",
    "the contribution of the coupling to the continuum would be prominent when the nucleus close to the drip line , therefore a proper treatment of the continuum becomes more important .",
    "single particle resonant states in the continuum , which differ from bound states , are metastable states with life times due to a sufficiently high centrifugal barrier ( for neutrons and protons ) and coulomb barrier ( for protons ) .",
    "the effect of the widths of resonant states on pairing correlations was not estimated by the usual non - relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb)@xcite or the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb)@xcite .",
    "the effect of a proper treatment of the resonant continuum on the pairing in the non - relativistic approach has been investigated@xcite .",
    "the investigation in the relativistic approach is reported very recently@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at the investigation on the effect of the resonant continuum on pairing correlations of neutron rich nuclei in the relativistic mean field theory plus bcs ( rmf+bcs ) approximation .",
    "particularly we shall focus our attention on the effect of widths of single particle resonant states in the description of neutron rich nuclei .",
    "it has been pointed out that pairing correlations could be well described by the simple bcs theory if single particle states in the continuum are properly treated@xcite .",
    "it is known that narrow resonant states in the continuum are well localized inside the nucleus due to a sufficiently high centrifugal barrier and coulomb barrier ( for proton only ) . in our previous work@xcite",
    ", we have shown that the nuclear dynamical processes can also be well described by the simple method where the continuum was replaced by only a few single particle resonant states . therefore",
    ", we may expect that using a few single particle resonant states instead of the discretized continuum , the pairing space would be large enough in order to give a good description on the ground state properties of neutron rich nuclei in the rmf , even within the bcs approximation .",
    "usually pairing correlations in the bcs approximation are treated in a phenomenological way based on empirical pairing gaps deduced from odd - even mass differences .",
    "this procedure works well in the valley of @xmath0-stability , where experimental masses are known .",
    "the predictive power for pairing gaps for nuclei far from the @xmath0-stability line is thus limited due to the unknown masses of such nuclei .",
    "therefore , a constant pairing strength is usually employed in the bcs calculation@xcite .",
    "we shall investigate the pairing effect in the rmf with the parameter set nl3@xcite , which give a good description of not only the ground state properties@xcite but also the collective giant resonance@xcite . to investigate the width effect of single particle resonant states on pairing correlations , we compare the results in three types of calculations : ( a ) the rmf+bcs approach where quasi - particle wave functions are obtained by a box boundary condition ; ( b ) the extended rmf+bcs approximation where wave functions of resonant states are calculated by imposing a proper scattering boundary condition for the continuous spectrum but the width of resonant states is not considered , which is denoted as rmf+bcsr ; ( c ) the full rmf+bcs ( rmf+bcsrw ) calculation where widths of single particle resonant states are taken into account explicitly .",
    "the paper is arranged as the follows . in sec.ii and",
    "sec.iii the relativistic mean field theory and the bcs approximation with explicitly considering the widths of the resonant continuum are presented .",
    "the effect of the resonant continuum on pairing correlations is formulated by introducing a continuum level density into the gap equations .",
    "the results calculated by different models mentioned above for neutron rich even - even ni isotopes are given and discussed in sec.iv .",
    "finally we give a brief summary in sec.v .",
    "the rmf theory @xcite is based on the effective lagrangian density which includes the nucleon field ( @xmath2 ) , the isoscalar scalar meson field ( @xmath3 ) , the isoscalar vector meson field ( @xmath4 ) , the isovector vector meson field ( @xmath5 ) , and electromagnetic field ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the lagrangian density is expressed as the following : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 denote the nucleon , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath12 mesons masses , respectively , while @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the corresponding coupling constants for the mesons , respectively .",
    "the vectors in isospin space are denoted by bold - faced symbols .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the field tensors of the vector fields @xmath19 , @xmath20 and of the photon , respectively , they are defined as : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23    in the eq.(1 ) , a non - linear scalar self - interaction term@xcite @xmath24 of the @xmath25 meson has been taken into account :    @xmath26    the dirac equation of a single - particle state in the rmf approximation can be expressed as following : @xmath27 \\psi _ { \\alpha}=e_{\\alpha}\\psi _ { \\alpha}~ ,   \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the single - particle energy and wave function , respectively . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are an attractive scalar and repulsive vector potential , respectively . in the rmf approximation ,",
    "scalar and vector potentials are produced by the classical meson fields : isoscalar @xmath3 , @xmath4 and isovector @xmath12 mesons as well as the photon , which are obtained in a self - consistent calculation for the nuclear ground state@xcite .",
    "the nucleon spinor @xmath32 in the dirac equation is expressed as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are upper and lower components of nucleon wave function , @xmath36 is the isospinor and @xmath37 is a spherical harmonics function .",
    "@xmath38 is a set of quantum numbers @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the dirac quantum number given by : @xmath41    for spherical nuclei , the dirac equation can be reduced to coupled equations of the radial part for @xmath42 and @xmath43 :    @xmath44    where @xmath30 is the scalar potential : @xmath45 and @xmath31 denotes the vector potential : @xmath46    the meson and electromagnetic fields obey the radial laplace equations : @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 with @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54    the sums @xmath55 run over all occupied states .",
    "the dirac equation eq.(9 ) and the corresponding meson field functions eq.(12 - 14 ) as well as the photon field function eq.(15 ) with expressions for source terms ( 16 - 19 ) can be solved self - consistently .",
    "more details on the relativistic mean - field theory can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the pairing correlation plays an important role in describing the ground state properties of open shell nuclei .",
    "the non - relativistic hfb@xcite or rhb@xcite theory can provide a unified description on the mean field and pairing correlations , but they require much more numerical effort than the simple bcs theory .",
    "however , the width effect of resonant states in the gap equation is missing in most previous works of the bcs theory or the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "recently , properly treating the contribution of resonant continuum to pairing correlations has been investigated in the non - relativistic hf+bcs as well as hfb in refs.@xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out@xcite that the resonant continuum hf+bcs approximation with a proper treatment of resonant continuum can reproduce the pairing correlation energies predicted by the continuum hfb approach up to the drip line . in this paper , we investigate the width effect of single particle resonant states on the pairing correlations in the relativistic approach .",
    "the pairing correlations of open shell nuclei are treated based on the rmf within the bcs approximation .",
    "a constant pairing strength is adopted in the bcs theory .",
    "although the extended rmf+bcs theory formulated with correct boundary conditions for the continuous spectrum is available in the literature@xcite , in the following we briefly summarize the essential points together with our model . from ref.@xcite , assuming constant pairing matrix elements in the vicinity of fermi level , one can obtain the so - called gap equations : @xmath56 @xmath57 = n ~ , \\label{eq21}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 represent the fermi energy , pairing gap , and the pairing force constant , respectively .",
    "@xmath61 is the number of neutrons or protons involved in the pairing correlations .",
    "the solution of those two coupled equations , eq.(20 ) and ( 21 ) allows one to find @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the contribution of the pairing interaction to the total energy can be expressed as following : @xmath62^{2 } ~ , \\label{eq22}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the occupation probability of a state with quantum numbers @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "for spherical nuclei , the eigenvalues of dirac equations are of degeneracy for magnetic quantum numbers @xmath66 within the same @xmath67 .",
    "one has : @xmath68      in order to take into account the width effect of resonant states in the continuum we introduce a level density of the continuum@xcite into the gap equations .",
    "when we introduce single particle resonant states with widths into the pairing correlations , the gap equations can be expressed as :    @xmath79    @xmath80 + \\sum_{\\nu } \\left(j_{\\nu}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right ) \\int_{i_{\\nu}}g_{\\nu}(\\varepsilon_{\\nu})\\left[1 - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\nu}-\\lambda}{\\sqrt{(\\varepsilon_{\\nu}-\\lambda)^{2}+\\delta^{2}}}\\right ] d\\varepsilon_{\\nu } = n ~. \\label{eq27}\\ ] ]    the sums @xmath55 and @xmath81 run over the bound states and resonant states involved in the pairing calculation , respectively , and @xmath82 is an energy interval associated with each partial wave @xmath73 .",
    "the factor @xmath83 is defined as : @xmath84 which is the so - called continuum level density and @xmath72 is the phase shift of the scattering state with angular momentum @xmath85 .",
    "the factor @xmath83 represents the variation of the localization of scattering states in the energy region of a resonance , in other words , it reflects the widths effect of the resonant states . for a very narrow resonant state ,",
    "the factor @xmath83 becomes a delta function .",
    "taking account of those resonant continuum in the gap equations , the expressions of various densities in eq.(16 - 19 ) have to be modified .",
    "they can be expressed as :    @xmath86    @xmath87    @xmath88    @xmath89    the dirac equation eq.(9 ) and meson field functions ( 12 - 14 ) as well as the photon field function ( 15 ) with corresponding densities ( 29 - 32 ) are solved self - consistently in an iterative way .",
    "therefore , the total binding energy can be written as : @xmath90^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot41\\cdot a^{-1/3 }   ~,\\label{eq33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last two terms are the pairing energy and the correction for the spurious center of mass motion , respectively .",
    "in this work we investigate the ground state properties of neutron rich even - even ni isotopes in the rmf+bcs model and explicitly take account of the continuum .",
    "particularly we shall focus our attention on the effect of single particle resonant states on the pairing correlation in those neutron rich nuclei .",
    "calculations are carried out in the rmf with the parameter set nl3 .",
    "three types of calculations : rmf+bcs , rmf+bcsr and rmf+bcsrw are performed .",
    "the effect of single particle states in the continuum on the ground state properties is investigated .    in our investigation ,",
    "the proton number of ni isotopes is @xmath91 , which is a closed shell .",
    "therefore , the proton pairing gap is taken to be zero . for the neutron case",
    ", we use a state - independent pairing strength @xmath92 , where the constant @xmath93 mev is adopted from ref.@xcite .",
    "it could also provide a best fit to reproduce experimental binding energies of known ni - isotopes . in practical calculations ,",
    "we restrict the pairing space to about one harmonic oscillator shell above and below the fermi surface in the rmf+bcs model .",
    "the levels include @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96,@xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , some of them , such as @xmath104 , and @xmath102 are single particle resonant states , depending on the isotopes .",
    "highly excited resonant states with large widths , such as @xmath105 and @xmath106 , are ignored in our calculations .",
    "obviously , an enlarged pairing space in the normal bcs calculation would change the pairing contribution due to a constant pairing interaction .",
    "therefore the results in cases of rmf+bcs and rmf+bcsr in fig.1 and fig.2 would be different if one includes more states in the pairing active space .",
    "it is found that the pairing properties are not affected too much if one includes the resonant states @xmath105 and @xmath106 with wide widths in the rmf+bcsrw calculation .",
    "the single particle energies and wave functions are first carried out by solving the dirac equation eq.(9 ) self - consistently . using those single particle states we can solve the bcs gap equations in the three approaches .",
    "the fermi energy and gap as well as the occupation probabilities of quasi - particle states are obtained simultaneously .",
    "the nuclear densities composed of quasi - particle states and potentials are recalculated",
    ". then we solve dirac equation again by an iterative way until the convergence is reached .",
    "the pairing correlation energies can be obtained in the eq.(22 ) in the three approaches , which are shown in fig.1 for neutron rich even - even ni isotopes of @xmath107 to 70 .",
    "pronounced differences of the pairing energies performed in various rmf+bcs approaches are observed for open shell nuclei , where the behavior of pairing energies is similar to those obtained by the rhb in refs.@xcite .",
    "the usual rmf+bcs approach produces the largest pairing energies , due to some non - resonant scattering states in the continuum are included .",
    "it can be seen in fig.1 that the pairing energies are reduced largely when the widths of single particle resonant states are taken into account in the rmf+bcsrw calculation .    in order to understand the difference presented by different treatments on pairing correlations , we plot the results of pairing gaps and fermi energies for neutron rich even - even ni isotopes with masses from 68 to 98 in fig.2(a ) and fig.2(b ) .",
    "the curve in fig.2 ( a ) is the empirical pairing gap given by @xmath108 .",
    "it is observed that pairing gaps are largely decreased when the width effect of single particle resonant states is taken in account in pairing correlation calculations , while the fermi energies remain unchanged for three approaches .",
    "this feature agrees with the case in the non - relativistic hf+bcs calculations@xcite .",
    "it is found that the pairing gaps in the rmf+bcsr calculation are close to those obtained in the box rmf+bcs approximation . as an example , for the neutron rich nucleus @xmath109ni , the pairing gap and fermi energy are @xmath110 = 1.558 mev and @xmath111=-1.278 mev in the rmf+bcsr approach , whereas , they are reduced to 1.223 mev and -1.256 mev , respectively when we perform the pairing correlation calculations by considering the width effect of resonances explicitly . the reduced pairing gap and fermi energy could change the occupation probability of neutrons at each single particle orbit near the fermi surface . in fig.3",
    "we show the occupation probabilities of neutron single particle levels in @xmath109ni as a function of corresponding energies .",
    "the arrow is the position of the neutron fermi surface . in @xmath109ni",
    "the fermi energy is very close to the continuum , therefore the continuum becomes important in the pairing correlations .",
    "some scattering states in the continuum , such as states 3@xmath112 and 3@xmath113 , which are not resonance states due to the low centrifugal barrier , are included in the rmf+bcs calculation",
    ". therefore the rmf+bcs approach overestimates the pairing correlation and produces large pairing energies and pairing gaps .",
    "it is found that the width effect on the pairing is to reduce the pairing correlations , therefore occupation probabilities of low - lying states below the fermi surface in the case of rmf+bcsrw are slightly larger than those without the width effect , and vice versa for states above fermi surface .",
    "in fig.4 we display the two - neutron separation energy @xmath114 : @xmath115 we calculate two - neutron separation energies for ni isotopes till the neutron drip line in three approaches , rmf+bcs , rmf+bcsr and rmf+bcsrw .",
    "the two - neutron separation energies calculated in the rmf without pairings are also plotted in fig.4 , which are denoted by crosses .",
    "the empirical data of @xmath114 are obtained by eq.(34 ) , where the experimental binding energies of the ni isotopes for @xmath11650 are taken from the ref.@xcite .",
    "the theoretical binding energies for ni isotopes are listed in table i. the position of the neutron drip line may be determined by the signature where the two - neutron separation energy changes its sign or the fermi energy becomes positive .",
    "it is found that the position of the neutron drip line predicted by various rmf+bcs models is located between @xmath117ni and @xmath118ni , the same result is also obtained in rhb calculations@xcite .",
    "it is found that the two - neutron separation energies calculated in various rmf+bcs approaches are very close to each other , which can well reproduce the experimental data in the region of @xmath119 to @xmath120 .",
    "in contrast , the results without pairing considerably deviate from the others .",
    "it indicates that the pairing is responsible to a reasonable description of the two - neutron separation energy .",
    "some disagreements with experimental data are found for @xmath121 and @xmath107 isotopes , which were also observed in the rhb calculation with the parameter set nl3@xcite .",
    "although pairing energies obtained in these three approaches with different treatment of pairings differ significantly , two - neutron separation energies are consistent with each other .",
    "this is because that differences , which appear in the pairing correlation energy are largely cancelled in the @xmath114 .    in table",
    "i , it is shown that the binding energies produced in the three rmf+bcs approaches scatter when nuclei are far away from the @xmath0 stable line . to clearly illustrate the width effect of the resonant states on the pairings we define a new quantity , which characterizes the pairing correlations energy : @xmath122 the @xmath123 of ni isotopes calculated in various approaches",
    "are plotted in fig.5 .",
    "it is shown that the results produced in the three approaches are very close to each other for those isotopes not far away from the @xmath0 stable - line .",
    "it implies that the width of the resonance in the pairing correlation could be neglected at @xmath124 .",
    "the rmf+bcs and rmf+bcsr give more or less similar values of @xmath123 , even near the drip line .",
    "the width effect gets more and more pronounced as the neutron number increases , especially near the drip line .",
    "therefore a proper treatment of the resonant continuum including its width might be necessary for the nuclei near the drip line .",
    "neutron rms radii of neutron rich even - even ni isotopes are further calculated in the three approaches , which are plotted in fig.6 .",
    "the rms radii calculated in the rmf are also shown in fig.6 and displayed by cross .",
    "it is seen that neutron rms radii of ni isotopes at @xmath125 calculated in all approaches are very close to each other , which is similar to what was observed in the binding energy .",
    "the neutron rms radii calculated in the rmf+bcs with a box become larger at @xmath126 in comparison with those produced in other approaches .",
    "this is due to the fact that the contribution of the pairing correlation from the scattering states @xmath127 and @xmath128 is included in the rmf+bcs calculations .",
    "they are not resonant states and their wave functions are not well localized inside the nucleus .",
    "the neutron rms radius for @xmath129ni given in the rmf is slightly smaller than that obtained in the other approaches .",
    "actually this is a natural result when the pairing correlation is switched on .",
    "the neutron rms radius in the rmf+bcs is increased because the pairing interaction scatters some neutrons from @xmath98 to the loosely bound state @xmath99 which is a state less localized .",
    "in contrast , in the case of @xmath109ni the states @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which are completely occupied in the rmf approximation are scattered to states @xmath101 and @xmath102 due to the pairing interaction .",
    "although the states @xmath101 and @xmath102 are close to or buried in the continuum , their wave functions are more localized inside the nucleus than those for the @xmath99 and @xmath100 states due to a high centrifugal barrier . therefore the rms radius of @xmath109ni calculated in the rmf is larger than that produced in calculations including the pairing correlation .",
    "we plot the neutron density of @xmath129ni in fig.7 , where the dash - dotted curve is obtained in the rmf , the short - dotted , dashed and solid curves are produced in the rmf+bcs , rmf+bcsr and rmf+bcsrw approaches , respectively .",
    "the tail of the density distribution gets larger when the pairing correlation is considered .",
    "the width effect on the density distribution is very small , which is consistent to the calculated neutron rms radii . in order to show the effect of the box size on the density in the box rmf+bcs approximation",
    "we also plot the neutron density with various values of the box size r@xmath130 = 15 , 20 , 25 fm in fig.7 .",
    "it is observed that the tail of the density strongly depends on the box size , where unphysical particle gas may appear in the exotic nucleus . in the rmf+bcs calculation",
    "non - resonant discretized states in the continuum are included in pairing correlation , such as @xmath127 and @xmath128 states .",
    "their wave functions have a long tail strongly depending on the box size .",
    "it is found that this problem is well overcome when one performs the pairing correlation calculation with only a few narrow resonant states in stead of those discretized states in the continuum .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the pairing correlation for neutron - rich ni isotopes in the relativistic mean field theory and bardeen - cooper - schrieffer approximation with a constant pairing strength .",
    "a proper treatment of the single particle resonant state in the continuum on pairing correlations has to include not only its energy , but also its width .",
    "the inclusion of the width of the resonant state in the pairings can be performed by introducing a level density in the continuum into the pairing gap equation .",
    "the resonant continuum is solved by imposing a proper scattering boundary condition .",
    "the investigation is performed in three approaches : rmf+bcs , rmf+bcsr and rmf+bcsrw with the effective lagrangian parameter set nl3 .",
    "a special attention is paid on the width effect of resonant states in the continuum on the pairing correlation for nuclei close to the drip line .",
    "we have studied the width effect of the resonant continuum on pairings : pairing gap , fermi energy and occupation probability , as well as nuclear ground state properties , such as binding energy , two - neutron separation energy , neutron rms radius and neutron density .",
    "the results show that a proper treatment of the resonant continuum in pairing correlations , which explicitly includes the width of the single particle resonant state is important for nuclei close to neutron drip line . they could affect the pairing gaps , fermi energies , pairing energies , and binding energies considerably",
    ". various rmf+bcs approaches could give a similar description on the ground state properties for nuclei not far away from the @xmath0 stable line .",
