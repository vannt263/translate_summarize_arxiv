    "the study of the dynamics of self  gravitating fluids is of extreme importance in the study of the formation of structures in the universe for from primordial perturbations via the gravitational instability .",
    "the solutions of the relevant dynamical equations are obtained by different techniques depending on the specific application .",
    "a newtonian approach is usually applied for perturbations on scales much smaller than the horizon distance , but much larger than the schwarzschild radii of collapsing objects @xcite .",
    "analytical methods are then used to follow the evolution of small perturbations and useful approximate solutions are also available to describe the system up to the mildly non  linear regime , such as the celebrated zeldovich approximation , while the general non  linear dynamics can only be followed numerically , e.g. by n  body codes .",
    "a relativistic treatment in cosmology is instead applied to study linear perturbations on large scales and/or at early times , and to the analysis of those few symmetric solutions of einstein s equations which are relevant in a cosmological context ( e.g. the spherically symmetric tolman ",
    "bondi metric ) .",
    "having a unified treatment of the problem , able to describe both the large  scale properties of the universe and the non  linear collapse of structures by gravitational instability on small scales would be highly desirable .",
    "building up such a theory is however hampered by the absence of symmetries in the system , which implies that all the matter and geometric degrees of freedom are possibly switched on during the non  linear evolution of self  gravitating matter .    a possible picture of the problem is represented by the fluid  flow approach , in which the dynamics is followed directly in terms of observable fluid variables ( such as density , shear , vorticity , etc . ) and other tensor quantities which describe the space  time curvature ( instead of the metric tensor ) .",
    "a complete description of the method can be found in the classical review by ellis ( 1971 ) . following this line of thought , matarrese , pantano & saez ( 1993 )",
    "have recently proposed a lagrangian , general relativistic approach to the fully non  linear dynamics of a collisionless fluid .",
    "the approach is based on two relevant simplifying assumptions : vanishing vorticity ( i.e. irrotational flow ) and negligible signal exchange by the gravitational field , as it is obtained by dropping the terms containing the so  called magnetic part @xmath0 of the weyl tensor in the non  linear evolution of the tide ( or electric part of the weyl tensor , @xmath1 ) . while the former assumption is a widely accepted one in the standard gravitational instability scenario of structure formation , the latter is certainly more problematic .",
    "the meaning of @xmath0 in linear theory is well known : it only contains vector and tensor modes ( e.g. bruni , dunsby & ellis 1992 ) ; if the vorticity vanishes , as in our case , no physical vector modes are present and @xmath0 at most contains gravitational waves . beyond linear theory , however , the physical content of @xmath0 is less clear .",
    "one can reasonably assume that in the absence of @xmath0 no gravitational waves occur : this is evident in a lagrangian approach , where , the absence of pressure gradients and the vanishing of @xmath0 imply that no spatial gradients appear in the evolution equations ( apart from those possibly contained in convective time derivatives , which can be dropped by going to the comoving matter frame ) .",
    "it is then clear that no actual wave propagation can occur when spatial derivatives are absent in the fluid and gravitational evolution equations .",
    "the method proposed by matarrese , pantano & saez ( 1993 ) takes advantage of the absence of spatial gradients to construct a lagrangian algorithm in which the dynamics of fluid elements is completely determined by local initial conditions ; each fluid element can be therefore independently followed up to the time when it enters a multi  stream region . in this sense",
    "the method is quite similar to the well  known zeldovich approximation in the newtonian context , to which it actually reduces to first order in a perturbation expansion .    while neglecting the fluid pressure ( i.e. taking @xmath2 ) and considering zero initial vorticity @xmath3 are reasonable assumptions in a cosmological framework , the condition @xmath4 has to be taken with more caution .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the only solutions of einstein equations , with @xmath5 are either of petrov type i , or conformally flat , or homogeneous and anisotropic of bianchi type i , or with two degenerate shear eigenvalues and described by a szekeres line  element .",
    "all of these cases require some restrictions on the initial data , which means that the exact conditions above are not suitable for studying cosmological structure formation with enough generality ; requiring @xmath6 and @xmath7 appears more feasible . in a recent work matarrese , pantano & saez ( 1994 )",
    "have clarified the dynamical role of the magnetic tensor , by calculating the behaviour of fluctuations around robertson  walker ( rw ) at second order in perturbation theory : whatever initially scalar perturbations are given , @xmath0 vanishes at first order , but not beyond .",
    "the important consequence of this result is that the non ",
    "vanishing @xmath0 allows for the influence of the surrounding matter on the evolution of fluid elements , through the presence of spatial gradients in the evolution equations .",
    "the magnetic tensor appears therefore responsible for the environmental influence of the matter on the non  linear evolution of fluid elements . as we shall see below ,",
    "although the signal carrying such a non  local information travels at finite speed , for perturbations on scales much smaller than the horizon distance it appears as an instantaneous newtonian effect .    in this paper",
    "we give a detailed derivation of the perturbative solutions at second order of the fluid and gravitational field equations , expressed in lagrangian form .",
    "we pay particular attention to the occurrence of non  local effects in the evolution of fluid elements away from the linear regime .",
    "this work complements and extends the results previously reported in ( matarrese , pantano & saez 1994 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the general fluid ",
    "flow method used to study the relativistic dynamics of a self  gravitating pressureless fluid , which we then specialize to the case of irrotational motions represented in a comoving frame , i.e. in lagrangian form ; to this aim we introduce suitably rescaled variables which describe deviations out of a homogeneous and isotropic universe expansion . in section 3",
    "we present our second order expansion and discuss its properties on scales larger and smaller than the horizon distance .",
    "some cosmological consequences of our work are discussed in section 4 .",
    "two appendices are added to help the comparison with the newtonian approximation and to provide some technical details on the derivation of the second order expressions .",
    "we use the signature @xmath8 ; latin indices refer to space ",
    "time coordinates , @xmath9 , greek indices to spatial ones , @xmath10 ; semicolons are used for covariant derivatives , commas for partial ones .",
    "units are such that the speed of light @xmath11 is one .",
    "in this section we shall introduce the equations which govern the dynamics of a collisionless perfect fluid in general relativity .",
    "the dynamical equations are written in terms of observable fluid quantities and other tensor quantities which directly describe the space  time curvature .",
    "a complete description and a full derivation of the equations presented here can be found in @xcite .",
    "the relativistic dynamics of a collisionless ( i.e. with vanishing pressure ) self  gravitating perfect fluid is determined by einstein s field equations and by the continuity equations for the matter stress  energy tensor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the energy density ( or matter density , in this case ) and @xmath14 the four  velocity of the fluid , normalized to @xmath15 .",
    "the local projection tensor into the rest frame of an observer moving with four  velocity @xmath14 is defined as @xmath16 , for which @xmath17 . by differentiating the velocity field",
    "one obtains the space  like tensor @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the acceleration vector @xmath20 , which is also space  like , @xmath21 , as it follows from the @xmath14 normalization .",
    "an overdot denotes convective differentiation with respect to the proper time @xmath22 of fluid elements ( for a general @xmath23index tensor , @xmath24 ) .",
    "being flow ",
    "orthogonal , the tensor @xmath25 can only have nine independent components : its skewsymmetric is the vorticity tensor @xmath26}$ ] ( the symbol @xmath27}$ ] stands for skewsymmetrization , @xmath28 for symmetrization ) , which describes rigid rotations of fluid elements with respect to a locally inertial rest frame . due to its antisymmetric character , @xmath3 has only three independent components which correspond to the vorticity vector @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the four  index levi ",
    "civita tensor .",
    "equivalently , @xmath31 .",
    "the symmetric part of @xmath25 can be further split into its trace @xmath32 , called the volume expansion scalar and its traceless part , @xmath33 , called the shear tensor .",
    "the volume expansion scalar , giving the local rate of isotropic expansion ( or contraction ) , defines a length ",
    "scale @xmath34 , through the equation @xmath35 .",
    "this length ",
    "scale is just the generalization of the scale ",
    "factor @xmath36 of homogeneous and isotropic rw models ; in that particular case @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is hubble s constant .",
    "the shear , on the other hand , describes a pure straining in which a spherical fluid volume is distorted into an ellipsoid with axis lengths changing at rates determined by the three @xmath39 eigenvalues , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the vanishing trace condition implies that this deformation leaves the fluid volume invariant , while , in the absence of vorticity , the principal axes of the shear keep their direction fixed during the evolution , in a local inertial rest frame .    for a collisionless perfect fluid the energy ",
    "momentum local conservation equations reduce to @xmath43 @xmath44 eq.(1 ) tells us that in absence of pressure gradients each fluid element moves along a geodesic , while eq.(2 ) is equivalent to the continuity equation for the particle number density , since the matter and energy density are directly proportional in our case .",
    "the expansion scalar satisfies the raychaudhuri equation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is newton s constant and we have introduced a possible cosmological constant @xmath47 and the two scalars @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "note that in the homogeneous and isotropic rw case , @xmath50 and the latter equation reduces to the familiar friedmann equation , @xmath51 .",
    "the vorticity vector evolves according to @xmath52 while the shear is determined by the equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the electric part of the weyl tensor @xmath55 .",
    "the tensor @xmath1 is also called tidal tensor , since it contains that component of the gravitational field which describes tidal interactions ; it is symmetric , traceless and flow  orthogonal , @xmath56 .    from the weyl tensor one can define another quantity : its magnetic part @xmath57 which is also symmetric , traceless and flow  orthogonal .",
    "while the tidal field has a straightforward newtonian analogue , which can be written in terms of derivatives of the gravitational potential , the magnetic tensor @xmath0 has no straightforward interpretation in the newtonian equations .",
    "the important point is that , while in newtonian theory , in its standard formulation , the gravitational potential is determined through a constraint , namely poisson s equation , in general relativity both @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be calculated by solving suitable evolution equations .    from the bianchi identities one can derive the following evolution equations for @xmath1 and @xmath0 @xmath58 @xmath59    in a collisionless fluid ,",
    "the velocity field satisfies the following constraint equations @xmath60 @xmath61 further constraints need to be satisfied by the electric and the magnetic tensor , namely @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64    finally , another useful quantity is the ( infinitesimal ) relative position vector @xmath65 between two neighbouring particles defined in the rest frame of the observer moving with four  velocity @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the vector components @xmath65 evolves according to the  generalized hubble law \" @xmath68      in a cosmological context one can safely assume zero initial vorticity for the fluid , i.e. @xmath69 ; kelvin s circulation theorem implies that this condition continues to hold until the fluid enters a multi  stream region . under the assumption of vanishing magnetic tensor , matarrese , pantano & saez ( 1993 )",
    "proposed a method for integrating the evolution equations in local inertial frames , taking advantage of the geodesics motion of collisionless particles .",
    "however , when spatial gradients explicitly occur , as it happens when @xmath70 , it is more convenient to adopt a global coordinate system , such as one comoving with the fluid .",
    "let us then rewrite the equations of section 2.1 in comoving coordinates .",
    "recalling that for a pressureless fluid comoving hypersurfaces ( orthogonal to the energy flow ) and synchronous ones ( orthogonal to geodesics ) coincide , one can write the line  element in the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 , as for a flat , matter  dominated rw model with vanishing cosmological constant ( our  background \" solution ) and the rescaled spatial projection tensor @xmath73 generally depends upon space and time coordinates . for computational convenience",
    "we then introduce suitably rescaled quantities @xcite : a scaled density fluctuation @xmath74 , a peculiar expansion scalar @xmath75 , a traceless shear tensor @xmath76 and a traceless tidal tensor @xmath77 .",
    "these quantities can be grouped in two space  like tensors : the velocity gradient tensor @xmath78 , related to the covariant derivatives of the peculiar velocity field and the peculiar gravitational field tensor @xmath79 .",
    "we also rescale the magnetic tensor as @xmath80 .",
    "the dynamical equations for the fluid and the gravitational field then read @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    where the prime denotes partial differentiation with respect to the scale factor @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the levi  civita tensor relative to the conformal spatial metric @xmath73 , namely @xmath86 , with @xmath87 .",
    "the traces of eqs.(15 ) and ( 16 ) yield , respectively , @xmath88 @xmath89 while the trace of eq.(17 ) vanishes identically . as shown by matarrese , pantano & saez ( 1994 ) , eq.(15 )",
    "coincides with the equation obtained by taking the spatial gradients of the newtonian euler equation in lagrangian form ; eq.(19 ) is instead identical to the newtonian continuity equation , also in lagrangian form ( see appendix a1 ) . since the traceless component of the evolution equation for @xmath90 ( i.e. the evolution equation for the tide ) has no newtonian analog",
    ", it follows that the magnetic tensor which enters through its spatial gradients in that equation , has no direct dynamical role in the newtonian theory as it is usually formulated ( i.e. in the standard form of appendix a1 ) .    in our comoving gauge , the spatial metric tensor , which appears explicitly and through its spatial gradients in the covariant derivatives of eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) ,",
    "evolves according to the equation @xmath91 using now our rescaled variables we can rewrite the constraints eqs.(9)(12 ) as @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95    note that the only christoffel symbols involved in the covariant derivatives of eqs.(16 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 21 )  ( 24 ) are the spatial ones , i.e. @xmath96 , which can be trivially obtained from @xmath73 .    the rescaled displacement vector @xmath97 obeys the equation @xmath98 the matrix connecting the eulerian coordinates @xmath99 with the lagrangian ones @xmath100 is the jacobian @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the symmetric deformation tensor . taking then @xmath103 , where @xmath104 represents the initial ( i.e. lagrangian ) infinitesimal displacement , one gets @xmath105 which is formally solved by @xmath106    once the jacobian is known one gets the metric at the `` time '' @xmath84 by performing the transformation @xmath107      initial perturbations can be given at the  time \" @xmath108 in a rw background by using the gauge  invariant formalism ( bardeen 1980 ) .",
    "here we consider only growing  mode scalar perturbations @xcite , @xmath109 where the scalar @xmath110 , an arbitrary function of the spatial coordinates @xmath111 , corresponds to the initial peculiar gravitational potential , which is related to bardeen s gauge ",
    "invariant @xmath112 by @xmath113 .",
    "these initial conditions correspond to the  seed \" metric @xmath114 and imply vanishing magnetic tensor @xmath115 at the linear level . in",
    "what follows , we will only consider the growing mode , proportional to @xmath116 , since the constant mode , proportional to @xmath117 , can be practically neglected during the subsequent evolution .",
    "also , in many cases it will be convenient to assume that the initial conditions are given at @xmath118 .",
    "it is important to realize that the constraints , eqs.(21)(24 ) , are all satisfied at the linear level @xcite by our choice of initial conditions .",
    "we shall now construct a second order lagrangian perturbation expansion in the amplitude of the fluctuations around the rw background solution .",
    "to this aim , it will prove useful to define the two scalar quantities @xcite @xmath119 @xmath120 where @xmath121 are the local eigenvalues of the symmetric tensor @xmath122 .",
    "let us then expand the relevant quantities retaining only terms up to second order , @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 where the zeroth order terms of @xmath126 and @xmath90 vanish , while the expansion of @xmath115 starts from second order .    for the velocity gradient tensor @xmath126 and the peculiar gravitational field tensor @xmath90 the first order",
    "terms obviously coincide with the initial data , @xmath127 while the second order corrections read ( for more details see appendix a2 ) @xmath128 @xmath129 here indices are raised by the kronecker symbol .",
    "the traceless tensors @xmath130 and @xmath131 represent the contributions coming from the magnetic part of the weyl tensor to @xmath126 and @xmath90 , respectively , and have zero divergence like the magnetic tensor @xmath115 itself at this order ( see eqs.(a12)(a13 ) ) .    from eqs.(37)(39 )",
    "one immediately obtains the traces @xmath132 and @xmath133 which coincide with those obtained in the lagrangian second order newtonian theory @xcite .",
    "we can perform a second  order expansion also for the spatial displacement vector @xmath134 @xmath135 from eqs.(25 ) and ( 37 ) one immediately gets @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 is given by @xmath139 with trace @xmath140 .",
    "since @xmath141 and @xmath142 one can write @xmath143 then , the second order perturbative solution for the deformation tensor reads @xmath144 we can immediately recognize that the first order term is nothing but the kinematical zeldovich approximation @xcite while the second order correction is provided by the symmetric tensor @xmath138 .",
    "in newtonian theory one would write the same formal expression , but the irrotationality condition would automatically lead to @xmath145 , with the potential @xmath146 satisfying the second order poisson equation @xmath147 which is consistent with the trace of the relativistic equation ( 45 ) .",
    "this implies that the newtonian eigenvalues @xmath148 of @xmath138 only need to satisfy the condition @xmath149 , while in order to get the complete information on the single @xmath148 s one needs the newtonian definition of @xmath138 as @xmath150 , i.e. a non  local information .",
    "the relativistic @xmath148 s also solve the newtonian equations , but the reverse is not necessarily true : it just depends upon the specific boundary conditions used in solving poisson s equation .    finally , from eqs.(26 ) , ( 29 ) we can compute the conformal spatial metric tensor @xmath151    the traceless , divergenceless symmetric tensor @xmath130 , representing the contribution to the velocity gradient tensor caused by the magnetic part of the weyl tensor , can be written as a convolution @xmath152 of the source tensor @xmath153 with the time ",
    "dependent function @xmath154 , whose fourier transform @xmath155 satisfies the third order linear differential equation @xmath156 where @xmath157 , with @xmath158 the conformal time , and @xmath159 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath160 .",
    "let us now analyse the evolution of the solution of eq.(52 ) , describing the behaviour of perturbations on scales much larger ( @xmath161 ) and much smaller ( @xmath162 ) than the horizon scale .      in the limit @xmath162 eq.(51 ) reduces to @xmath163 setting @xmath164 eq.(53 ) reads @xmath165 whose formal solutions are @xmath166 with @xmath167 .",
    "keeping only the growing mode , we then find @xmath168 when @xmath169 , i.e. when the characteristic scale of the perturbation exceeds the horizon distance , @xmath170 , and the contribution to @xmath126 due to the magnetic tensor becomes negligible ; a similar reasoning would apply to @xmath171 .",
    "the relevant expressions can then be obtained from eqs.(38 ) , ( 39 ) and ( 50 ) : @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 perturbations with size larger than the hubble radius evolve as a separate silent universe , with spatial gradients playing no role .",
    "note that the expression in eq.(55 ) , and the related results in eqs.(56 ) ",
    "( 58 ) could have been obtained by taking the @xmath175 limit in eq.(52 ) .",
    "unfortunately , these general relativistic effects have little implications for the problem of cosmological structure formation , since perturbations on super  horizon scales are usually assumed to have very small amplitude , so that a linear approximation is sufficient .",
    "conversely , the validity of the silent universe approximation on ultra ",
    "large scales might suggest its use as a mathematical tool to look for cosmologically interesting background solutions of einstein s field equations .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of formal consequences of our relativistic solutions , which is worth mentioning .",
    "one of these is the absence of two  dimensional configurations .",
    "this can be seen as follows : if one eigenvalue of @xmath122 , e.g. @xmath176 , vanishes everywhere , the newtonian theory , with suitable boundary conditions , would imply @xmath177 or @xmath178 , i.e. no motion along the third axis .",
    "this is usually referred as  two  dimensional \" gravitational clustering .",
    "as far as the second order deformation tensor is concerned , one would have @xmath179 , with @xmath180 , and @xmath181 . in the general relativistic case with @xmath182 ,",
    "instead , we immediately find @xmath183 , and @xmath184 for @xmath185 .",
    "the motion dynamically impressed along the third axis soon becomes of the same order of magnitude as that in the other two directions .",
    "this effect is to be ascribed to the tide  shear coupling term @xmath186 in the evolution equation for the tide , which reduces to @xmath187 to lowest perturbative order , namely second order .",
    "the only case when this coupling disappears is when two @xmath121 s simultaneously vanish , i.e. for planar symmetry .",
    "therefore @xmath177 is not an exact solution of the relativistic equations , unless another @xmath188 also vanishes . as an example ,",
    "no axisymmetric configurations without motion along the symmetry axis are allowed .      in the limit @xmath161",
    "it is convenient to define the function @xmath189 as follows @xmath190 where @xmath189 now obeys the equation @xmath191 with initial conditions at @xmath192 equal to @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the general solution of the above equation reads : @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath197 are independent solutions of the homogeneous wave equation @xmath198 and @xmath199 is the wronskian .",

    "a numerical integration of eq.(52 ) shows the range of validity of the approximate solutions in eqs.(55 ) and ( 64 ) ; this is shown in figure 1 , where we plot the numerical solution of eq.(52 ) vs. the two asymptotic expressions .",
    "let us consider now the evolution of an infinite homogeneous ellipsoid , for which @xmath115 ( this can be seen by noting that the source tensor in eq.(51 ) has no fourier modes inside the hubble radius ) .",

    "our second order perturbative approach to the general relativistic dynamics of irrotational dust can be used to provide some insight on the main dynamical issue : the fate of general perturbations .",
    "so far , only a few analytical solutions of the lagrangian system of eqs.(15 )  ( 24 ) are known : for exact planar symmetry , @xmath242 , one recovers the zeldovich pancake solution ( zeldovich 1970 ) , as shown by matarrese , pantano & saez ( 1993 ) , which , in a relativistic context can be seen as a particular szekeres model ( szekeres 1975 ; see also the discussion by kasai 1992 , 1993 and croudace et al .",

    "the dominant role of this term for the non  linear fluid evolution is a peculiarity of the purely local equations , which certainly applies to perturbations on super  horizon scales , but can not be easily understood in the newtonian limit . as a further illustration of this interpretation",
    "let us consider the collapse of an infinite homogeneous ellipsoid , which is described by our equations when @xmath254 .",
    "in such a case the newtonian dynamics is known to lead to the formation of oblate spheroids ( e.g. white & silk 1979 ; barrow & silk 1981 ) , pancake  like objects with one collapsing axis and the other two tending to a finite size ( apart from initial conditions corresponding to an initially prolate spheroid ) .",
    "the general relativistic dynamics , instead , favours the formation of prolate objects , collapsing filaments with expansion along their axis .",
    "this point is discussed in some detail by zeldovich & novikov ( 1983 ) , who argue that the discrepant behaviour is due to the different role of boundary conditions at infinity in the two theories .",
    "our second order calculations show that the evolution of fluid elements as isolated ellipsoids can not apply to perturbations on scales smaller than the hubble radius , where non  local effects would play a fundamental role .",
    "the appearance of non  local terms in general solutions of the newtonian theory has been recently stressed by kofman ( 1994 ) .",
    "given that the magnetic part of the weyl tensor is generated during the mildly non  linear evolution of irrotational dust , even in case it was primordially set to zero , is there any application left for a purely local treatment on cosmologically relevant scales ?",
    "one can try to make some guess .",
    "it may be that during the late phases of the evolution of a given fluid element , i.e. in the strongly non  linear regime , the role of the magnetic tensor becomes negligible again , possibly due to the fact that some sort of ( approximate ) local axisymmetry is dynamically established .",
    "however , if this picture should prove correct one can not assume that the principal axes of the collapsing ellipsoid coincide with the initial ones ; in fact , already at second order in perturbation theory the effect of the magnetic tensor is that of tilting these axes , on account of the interaction with the environment .",
    "a further complication is induced by the occurrence of orbit crossing with the subsequent formation of multi  streaming .",
    "let us finally mention what we think is an important point .",
    "the main lesson we have learned from the purely local treatment , our silent universe approach , is that one could try to isolate two competing effects : i ) if @xmath115 is switched off , the fate of the collapse of a general fluid element is completely determined by its local initial conditions ; in such a case , one would generally expect prolate rather than oblate collapse .",
    "ii ) in the real world , however , @xmath115 is non  zero except for a number of unrealistic cases listed in the introduction ; @xmath115 carries information on the action of the  rest of the world \" on the considered fluid element , i.e. what can be called the effects of the environment .",
    "in other words , the matter surrounding the fluid element acts by compressing or stretching , and generally deforming it , thus modifying its local dynamics in a way which can not be easily predicted a priori . the relevant issue is : which of these two competing effects is going to dominate on the long run ?",
    "it seems to us that the answer generally depends upon various variables : the scenario ( e.g. cold or hot dark matter , amount of baryons , etc . ) , and the overall initial conditions , as they are usually implied by the power  spectrum and the statistics of the primordial density fluctuation field .",
    "while completing this work two preprints have circulated ( bertschinger & hamilton 1994 ; kofman & pogosyan 1994 ) , where the non  linear evolution equation for the electric component of the weyl tensor is derived from newtonian gravity . the presence of a non  vanishing non  local contribution in this limit agrees with our previous results ( matarrese , pantano & saez 1994 ) on the behaviour of the general relativistic equations inside the hubble radius .",

    "the equations which govern the non  linear dynamics of a collisionless fluid in newtonian theory for an expanding universe can be written as ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) @xmath255 @xmath256 @xmath257 where @xmath258 is the peculiar velocity , @xmath259 the peculiar gravitational potential and @xmath260 the fractional density contrast . in order to compare these equations with the relativistic ones it is convenient to use rescaled variables for the velocity field @xmath261 , the density fluctuation field @xmath262 and the local gravitational potential @xmath263 and to adopt as time variable the scale factor @xmath84 itself ( e.g. gurbatov , saichev & shandarin 1989 ; matarrese et al .",

    "it is clear that the newtonian approximation described above is degenerate , as it provides only one equation to fully determine the symmetric tensor @xmath90 : any traceless tensor added to the r.h.s . of eq.(16 ) , leaves the newtonian equations unchanged . in order to completely determine the evolution of the gravitational field tensor @xmath90 one has to resort to its definition in terms of the potential @xmath269 , i.e. to a non  local theory . because of the intrinsic non  locality of the newtonian approximation one needs boundary conditions to determine the dynamics , contrary to the general relativistic equations , where cauchy data on a spatial hypersurface are enough ; this comes from the fact that the poisson equation ( a6 ) is an elliptic , constraint equation .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. ellis 1971 ) that the lack of evolution equations for the traceless part of the gravitational tensor , @xmath221 , implies that the newtonian theory may add spurious solutions which would be discarded by the full relativistic system .",
