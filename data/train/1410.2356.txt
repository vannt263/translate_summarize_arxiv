    "base-@xmath11 palindromes and examples with leading zeros are not considered so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    previous work on palintiple numbers mostly restricts its attention to a limited number of digits @xcite or on characterizing base-10 palintiples @xcite .",

    "letting @xmath2 be an @xmath8-palintiple with carries @xmath14 , @xmath15,@xmath16 , @xmath17 , these classes are defined as follows : we say that @xmath7 is _ symmetric _ if @xmath18 for all @xmath6 and that @xmath7 is _ shifted - symmetric _ if @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",

    "moreover , the behavior of asymmetric palintiples is considerably more haphazard . on one hand ,",
    "@xmath70-digit symmetric palintiples exist in every base for all @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , the existence of a shifted - symmetric @xmath8-palintiple ensures the existence of a @xmath70-digit example for all @xmath72 . on the other hand , minimal examples of asymmetric palintiples",

    "this minimal number of digits can be quite large : the smallest @xmath73-palintiple is 105 digits long .",
    "furthermore , unlike the symmetric and shifted - symmetric cases , the existence of a @xmath70-digit asymmetric @xmath8-palintiple does not guarantee the existence of a @xmath74-digit example .",
    "( we note , however , that symmetrically concatenating digit strings of @xmath8-palintiples yields other representations of larger @xmath8-palintiples ( @xcite ) .",

    "finding such conditions is key to finding all palintiples .",
    "the work of kendrick @xcite reveals the asymmetric class to be more diverse than previously thought .",
    "given the large variety of young graph isomorphism classes that arise for even relatively low bases ( @xmath101 ) and the apparent rate at which the number of isomorphism classes grows with @xmath11 , the difficulties presented by the asymmetric class are not surprising .",
    "such difficulties naturally lead to the question of bases which do not allow for their existence ( that is , bases for which all palintiples are known ) . considering bases up to 20 ,",
    "asymmetric palintiples are known to exist in bases 8 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 19 , and 20 . on the other hand ,",
    "methods developed by young @xcite along with corollary [ irreg ] show that if conjecture [ carries_mod_n_minus_one ] holds , that no asymmetric palintiples exist in bases 5 , 7 , 9 , and 13 . in similar fashion",
    ", it is conjectured that only symmetric palintiples exist in bases 10 , 12 , and 16 .",

    "this number may very well be finite : electronically implementing the methods of young @xcite we see that , with the exception of those mentioned above , there are no symmetric bases less than 544321 .",
