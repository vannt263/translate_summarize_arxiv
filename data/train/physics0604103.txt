    "evolutionary game theory has been considered an important approach to characterizing and understanding the emergence of cooperative behavior in systems consisting of selfish individuals @xcite .",
    "such systems are ubiquitous in nature , ranging from biological to economic and social systems . since the groundwork on repeated games by axelrod @xcite ,",
    "the evolutionary prisoner s dilemma game ( pdg ) as a general metaphor for studying the cooperative behavior has drawn much attention from scientific communities . due to the difficulties in assessing proper payoffs , the pdg has some restriction in discussing the emergence of cooperative behavior .",
    "thus , the proposal of the snowdrift game ( sg ) was generated to be an alternative to the pdg .",
    "the sg , equivalent to the hawk - dove game , is also of biological interest @xcite .",
    "however , in these two games , the unstable cooperative behavior is contrary to the empirical evidence .",
    "this disagreement motivates a number of extensions of the original games to provide better explanations for the emergence of cooperation @xcite .",
    "the spatial game , introduced by nowak and may @xcite , is a typical extension , which can result in emergence and persistence of cooperation in the pdg .",
    "motivated by the idea of the spatial game , many interests have been given to the effects of spatial structures , such as lattices @xcite and networks @xcite , on cooperative behavior .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , hauert and doebeli found that compared to the pdg , cooperation is inhibited by the spatial structure .",
    "the surprising finding is in sharp contrast to one s intuition , since in comparison with the pdg , the sg favors cooperation .",
    "more recently , santos and pacheco @xcite discovered that scale - free networks provide a unified framework for the emergence of cooperation .",
    "besides , szab et al .",
    "@xcite presented a stochastic evolutionary rule to capture the bounded rationality of individuals for better characterizing the dynamics of games in real systems .    among the previous work ,",
    "the effects of individuals memory have not received much attention in the study of evolutionary games on networks .",
    "we argue that individuals usually make decisions based on the knowledge of past records in nature and society , and the historical memory would play a key role in an evolutionary game .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we propose a memory - based snowdrift game ( mbsg ) , in which players update their strategies based on their past experience .",
    "our work is partially inspired by challet and zhang @xcite , who presented a so - called minority game , in which agents make decisions exclusively according to the common information stored in their memories .",
    "it is found that finite memories of agents have crucial effects on the dynamics of the minority game @xcite .",
    "we focus on the evolutionary sg for its general representation of many social and biological scenarios .",
    "the mbsg on different network structures , including lattices and scale - free networks , is studied .",
    "transitions of spatial patterns with relevant sudden decreases of the frequencies of cooperation are observed in lattices .",
    "local stability analyses are provided for explaining such phenomena . in a scale - free network , cooperation level peaks at a specific value of payoff parameter , which is different from previously reported results . for both lattices and scale - free networks",
    ", we found that memory effects play different roles on the frequency of cooperation for distinct ranges of the payoff parameter .",
    "we first briefly describe the original sg model .",
    "imagine that two cars are trapped on either side of a huge snowdrift .",
    "both drivers can either get out of the car to shovel ( cooperate - c ) or stay in the car ( defect - d ) in any one negotiation .",
    "if they both choose c , then they both gain benefit @xmath2 of getting back home while sharing labor @xmath3 of shovelling , i.e. , both get payoff @xmath4 .",
    "if both drivers choose d , they will still be trapped by the snowdrift and get nothing .",
    "if one shovels ( c ) while the other one stays in the car ( d ) , then they both can get home but the defector pays no labor cost and gets a perfect payoff @xmath2 , while the cooperator gets @xmath5 . without losing generality , @xmath4 is usually set to be @xmath6 so that the evolutionary behavior of the sg can be investigated with a single parameter , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , one has a rescaled payoff matrix @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "though , compared with the pdg , the payoff rank of the sg favors the emergence of cooperation , cooperation is still unstable , which results from the highest payoff of defectors .    here , we introduce the rules of the evolutionary mbsg .",
    "consider that @xmath10 players are placed on the nodes of a certain network . in every round ,",
    "all pairs of connected players play the game simultaneously .",
    "the total payoff of each player is the sum over all its encounters .",
    "after a round is over , each player will have the strategy information ( c or d ) of its neighbors .",
    "subsequently , each player knows its best strategy in that round by means of self - questioning , i.e. , each player adopts its anti - strategy to play a virtual game with all its neighbors , and calculates the virtual total payoff . comparing the virtual payoff with the actual payoff , each player can get its optimal strategy corresponding to the highest payoff and then record it into its memory .",
    "taking into account the bounded rationality of players , we assume that players are quite limited in their analyzing power and can only retain the last @xmath11 bits of the past strategy information . at the start of the next generation , the probability of making a decision ( choosing c or d ) for each player depends on the ratio of the numbers of c and d stored in its memory , i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the numbers of c and d , respectively .",
    "then , all players update their memories simultaneously .",

    "@xmath16 can be obtained by counting the number of cooperators in the whole population after the system reaches a steady state , at which the number of cooperators shows slight fluctuations around an average value .",
    "hence , @xmath16 is the ratio of the cooperator number and the total number of individuals @xmath10 .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath16 ranges from @xmath33 to @xmath6 , where @xmath33 and @xmath6 correspond to cases of no cooperators and entire cooperator state .",

    "figures 1 ( a ) and ( b ) show @xmath16 as a function of the parameter @xmath17 on the lattices of four and eight neighbors , respectively . in these two figures , four common features should be noted : ( i ) @xmath16 has a step structure , and the number of steps corresponds to the number of neighbors on the lattice , i.e. , @xmath0 steps for the @xmath0-neighbor lattice and @xmath1 steps for the @xmath1-neighbor lattice ; ( ii ) the two figures have @xmath34-rotational symmetry about the point ( @xmath35 , @xmath35 ) ; ( iii ) the memory length @xmath11 has no influences on the dividing point @xmath36 between any two cooperation levels , but has strong effects on the value of @xmath16 in each level ; ( iv ) for a large payoff parameter @xmath17 , the system still behaves in a high cooperation level , contrary to the results reported in @xcite .",

    ". one can find that @xmath16 is a monotonous function of @xmath11 for both levels and the decreasing velocity of @xmath16 in the @xmath6st level is faster than that in the @xmath27nd one . in contrast , in the @xmath1-neighbor lattice , @xmath16 exhibits some non - monotonous behaviors as @xmath11 increases . as shown in the bottom inset of fig . 1 ( b )",

    "thus , memory length @xmath11 plays a very complex role in @xmath16 reflected by the remarkably different behaviors in @xmath0 cooperation levels .",
    "it is worth to point out that in case of @xmath29 , the evolutionary behavior of the system sharply differs from that of @xmath48 , since each individual will definitely adopt the exclusive strategy stored in its memory to play the game at the next time step .",

    "2 ( b ) and ( a ) with c and d site exchanged , respectively , which are not shown here . therefore , there exist four kinds of spatial patterns with typical features corresponding to four levels of @xmath16 .",
    "the pattern formation can be explained in terms of steady local patterns . in fig . 2 ( c ) , we show the steady local patterns existing in the @xmath6st cooperation level . from the payoff ratio by choosing c and d of individual",
    "a , i.e. , @xmath62 , the @xmath46rd local pattern is the most stable one with the highest payoff ratio . in parallel ,",
    "the @xmath0th local pattern is the counterpart of the @xmath46nd one , so that it is also very stable .",

    "similarly , the chessboard - like background in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) is also attributed to the strongest stability of the @xmath0th and @xmath47th local patterns , and the probability of the occurrence of other local patterns is correlated with their payoff ratios .",

    "3 , we figured out that each cooperation level exhibits a unique pattern and the difference between the patterns of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the exchange of c and d sites . for the @xmath6st and @xmath27nd levels ,",

    "the pattern shows a shape of labyrinth , and the fraction of c sites is slightly larger than that of d sites .",

    "4 ( a ) ) switch to cooperators together at the next time step ( denoted by the large area in black in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) ) , which contributes to the big oscillation of @xmath16 . the strategy - switch behavior of large proportional individuals can be easily explained by noting the fact that individuals will update their strategies by adopting the exclusive strategy in their memories ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "moreover , individuals record the strategy on the basis of their neighbors strategy at the last time step . in the strategy - switch area , individuals have identical strategies at each time step .",
    "therefore , at the next step , each individual should choose the anti - strategy of its neighbors to gain more payoffs since each one only records its last step s history .",

    "the authors found that all ( few ) high degree nodes are occupied by cooperators , whereas defectors only manage to survive on nodes of moderate degree .",

    "<S> interestingly , we found that the frequency of cooperation of the mbsg on a scale - free network peaks at a specific value of the payoff parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon indicates that properly encouraging selfish behaviors can optimally enhance the cooperation . </S>",
    "<S> the memory effects of individuals are discussed in detail and some non - monotonous phenomena are observed on both lattices and scale - free networks . </S>",
    "<S> our work may shed some new light on the study of evolutionary games over networks . </S>"
