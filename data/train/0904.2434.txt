    "recent investigations of the integrable coupled nonlinear schrdinger equation , namely the celebrated manakov model , and the observation of intensity redistribution in the collision of solitons [ 1 - 5 ] have clearly pointed out their potential usage in the field of optical communications and have virtually set in motion the process of designing an all optical computing machine . in particular , the vector solitons undergoing energy sharing collision identified in the coupled nls equation turned out to be the key in the growing list of alternatives to the paradigm of soliton based chips , at least for specialized applications including quantum computing [ 6 ] , dna computing [ 7 ] and dynamics based computing based on chaos [ 8 ] .",
    "it is known that the identification of dromions [ 9,10 ] in the davey - stewartson equation which is a ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional generalization of the nls equation has given the much needed impetus to the investigation of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional integrable models .",
    "these dromions which are localized exponentially in all directions are essentially driven by certain lower dimensional arbitrary functions of space and time .",
    "in fact , such lower dimensional arbitrary functions of space and time have consolidated the concept of integrability of the associated dynamical systems in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions besides being tailor made for the construction of various kinds of localized solutions . reflecting on the flurry of activities taking place in the field of optical communication ever since the identification of shape changing collision of vector solitons in the coupled nls equation and the rapid strides made in the field of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) after the observation of dromions in the davey - stewartson i ( dsi ) equations , one would be tempted to look for the possibility of identifying the counterparts of vector solitons in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions as well .",
    "in fact , the recent derivation of the two component long wave short wave resonance interaction ( 2clsri ) equation in the context of the interaction of nonlinear dispersive waves on three channels [ 11 ] has only fuelled the anticipation to look for such localized excitations .",
    "this is also further supported by the study of collision behaviour of plane solitons admitted by the 2clsri equation recently [ 12 ] . in this paper",
    ", we investigate 2clsri equation and confirm its painleve property .",
    "we then suitably employ the recently developed truncated painleve approach [ 13 - 16 ] and generate multimode dromions .",
    "it should be mentioned that this is the first time the existence of exponentially localized solutions has been reported in a vector ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional nonlinear pde .",
    "finally , we also study the unusual interaction of multimode dromions .",
    "we now consider the two component long wave short wave resonance interaction ( 2clsri ) equation in the following form    @xmath2    [ i ]    the above equation is the two component analogue of the long wave short wave resonance interaction equation investigated recently [ 13 ] . in eq.(1 ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent short waves while l denotes a long wave",
    ". in particular , it explains the interaction of long interfacial wave ( l ) and a short surface wave ( s ) in a two layer fluid .",
    "this equation has been investigated recently and line solitons have been generated [ 11,12 ] .",
    "we now rewrite the above equation by putting @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 as    @xmath7    [ s1 ]    we now effect a local laurent expansion of the variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the neighbourhood of a noncharacteristic singular manifold @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",

    "one can proceed further to determine all other coefficients of the laurent expansions ( 9 ) without the introduction of any movable critical manifold .",
    "thus , the 2clsri equation indeed satisfies the painlev property .",
