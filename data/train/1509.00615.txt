    ". meanwhile the density minimum of the soliton scales as @xmath64 @xcite .    noting that dark solitons are stationary solutions in a moving frame , we numerically seek solutions to the gpe ( [ eqn : gpe ] ) with a galilean boost term @xmath65 in the hamiltonian .",
    "discretizing @xmath66 on a 1d spatial grid ( spacing @xmath67 ) we minimise the discretized hamiltonian with respect to changes in @xmath66 using a bi - conjugate method @xcite .",
    "starting with the non - dipolar dark soliton solution ( [ eqn : ds ] ) , this method leads to convergence to the required dipolar soliton solution , within the entire speed range @xmath68 . the numerical box ( up to @xmath69 ) is large enough to mimic the infinite limit .",
    "the numerically - obtained dark solutions propagate with constant speed and permanent form ( no dispersion or radiative losses ) when simulated within the lab - frame gpe @xcite , confirming their solitonic character .",
    "dark solitons require the mean - field potential of the homogeneous system to be net repulsive @xcite , i.e. @xmath70 , the same as the condition for phonon stability .",

    "the soliton size is characterised by the dipolar healing length @xmath75 ( hence motivating this choice of units ) .",
    "away from the unstable band of @xmath46 , the profile approximates the @xmath76-squared density profile of the non - dipolar soliton .",
    "as the phonon instability is approached ( for @xmath47 ) the profile diverges in width ; this is related to a cancellation between the local interactions arising from the explicit van der waals interactions and an implicit local contribution to the dipole - dipole interactions @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , as the roton instability is approached , prominent density ripples form about the soliton core ( see inset ) .",
    "these finite-@xmath51 corrugations arise due to the mixing of the roton with the soliton state , with analogous ripples arising for vortices @xcite . with increasing speed",
    ", the soliton depth decreases in line with the non - dipolar soliton , and the above qualitative behaviour remains , albeit with weaker ripples as the speed is increased .",
    "the soliton phase profile is insensitive to @xmath46 and @xmath10 .",
    "the soliton modifies the mean - field dipolar potential @xmath77 in a non - local manner .",

    "( [ eqn : u ] ) around infinity gives @xmath78 @xcite .",

    "the @xmath3 decay of @xmath79 demonstrates that the soliton appears as a localized giant dipole , a key result of our work .",

    "in contrast , a slow power - law - decaying density profile would render the object as an extended dipole at all scales , as for vortices in 2d @xcite .",
    "the negative sign on the soliton contribution suggests that the soliton may be viewed as a collection of _ anti - dipoles _ superposed on a homogeneous background of conventional dipoles .",

    "the soliton repulsion is significantly enhanced , turning them at increased separation , indicative of the role of the non - local interactions . here",

    "vice versa , for ( c ) @xmath16 the dipole - dipole interactions introduce an _ attraction _ between solitons ; however , the effect of this is barely visible due to the dominance of the hard - sphere - like repulsion at short - range .",

    "<S> we study the family of static and moving dark solitons in quasi - one - dimensional dipolar bose - einstein condensates , exploring their modified form and interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the density dip of the soliton acts as a giant anti - dipole which adds a non - local contribution to the conventional local soliton - soliton interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we map out the stability diagram as a function of the strength and polarization direction of the atomic dipoles , identifying both roton and phonon instabilities . away from these instabilities , </S>",
    "<S> the solitons collide elastically . </S>",
    "<S> varying the polarization direction relative to the condensate axis enables tuning of this non - local interaction between repulsive and attractive ; the latter case supports unusual dark soliton bound states . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , these bound states are themselves shown to behave like solitons , emerging unscathed from collisions with each other . </S>"
