    "the engine powering such short - hard grbs and their associated high - lorentz - factor ejecta is thought to be linked to mass accretion from a torus onto a central black hole , formed when the super - massive neutron star ( smns ) born from the coalescence eventually collapses . in recent years , models of grb production from a high - mass , magnetar - like ,",

    "the ejecta may be confined by the magnetic field morphology or by the intense neutrino - driven baryon - loaded wind thought to accompany coalescence and black hole mass accretion @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of bns mergers have a rich history , and have been considerably refined over the years , moving from 2d to 3d ; from newtonian to post - newtonian , conformally flat , and finally to full general relativity ( gr ) ; from simple polytropic to more sophisticated equations of state ( eos ) ; from the neglect of neutrinos to approximate neutrino - trapping schemes .",
    "bns merger studies yield predictions for 1 ) their associated gravitational wave signals @xcite , 2 ) the production of short - hard grbs @xcite , and 3 ) the pollution of the environment by r - process nuclei @xcite .",

    "3d newtonian simulations without neutrino transport were performed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite included neutrinos using a grid - based code , and this was followed by @xcite and @xcite using a 3d sph code .",
    "recently , @xcite applied such a neutrino - leakage scheme in their study of torus - disk mass accretion around a black hole formed in a bns merger , and addressed neutrino emission and annihilation .",
    "magnetic fields in bns merger evolution were introduced in 3d newtonian simulations by @xcite and @xcite .    in parallel ,",
    "there have been improvements to the newtonian approach to incorporate the effects of gr ( although largely neglecting microphysics ) , which become important as the two neutron stars come closer and eventually merge .",
    "post - newtonian simulations were performed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the conformally - flat approximation was introduced in @xcite and followed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "full 2d gr simulations , sometimes including magnetic fields , have been performed for super - massive neutron stars ( smns ) , possibly resulting from bns mergers , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , while full 3d gr simulations of the merger were carried out by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "all these simulations have been conducted at various levels of sophistication for the thermodynamic properties of matter , ranging from simplistic and not so physically - consistent polytropic eoss , to those employing a detailed microphysical representation of nuclear matter at an arbitrary temperature @xcite .",
    "investigations performed with such detailed eoss have been conducted by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and the dependency of bns merger properties on the adopted eos has been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "variations of a few times 10% in the maximum allowed mass are seen , depending on the compressiblity of nuclear matter , but recent observations may suggest that neutron stars with a gravitational mass in excess of 2do exist @xcite , supporting a stiff eos for nuclear matter , such as the shen eos we employ here . in fig .",
    "[ fig_bh ] , we show , as a function of the central density , the baryonic and gravitational neutron star masses that obtain for our implementation of the shen eos .",

    "moreover , in the context of differentially rotating ( and possibly magnetized ) smnss , the maximum mass that can be supported by a given eos may be increased by up to @xmath450% compared to the equivalent non - rotating object @xcite .",
    "ultimately , understanding the mechanisms and timescales for angular momentum to be redistributed to lead to solid - body rotation is , therefore , important .",
    "one possible agency of redistribution is the magneto - rotational instability @xcite .",
    "the implications are non - trivial because the efficiency of angular - momentum transport determines in part whether a black hole forms promptly , or after a short or a long delay",
    ". it also determines how much mass can be accreted , i.e. , whether there is @xmath40.01 or @xmath40.1available in the torus surrounding the black hole after it has formed , and what the timescale is over which such accretion can take place to power relativistic ejecta . although indirect , the relevance to short - hard grbs and their properties is obvious , and perhaps central .",

    "we perform 2d multi - group , flux - limited - diffusion ( mgfld ) , radiation hydrodynamics of merged bnss using the shen eos . the main goal of this work is to document in detail the neutrino signatures from such merger events .",
    "our approach is to solve the neutrino transport problem self - consistently ( although with a flux - limiter and assuming diffusion ) , in combination with the dynamics of the system ( but assuming axisymmetry ) , over @xmath0100ms . at selected times , we post - process such models with the multi - angle , @xmath21 , neutrino transport algorithm of @xcite and described recently in @xcite . in particular",

    "[ annihil : sn ] , we then present a new formalism which uses moments of the neutrino specific intensity computed with a multi - angle , @xmath21 , scheme .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in   [ sect : conclusion ] and discuss the most striking implications for the powering of short - duration grbs . for completeness , in the appendix , we apply our formalism to the computation of the annihilation rate in the context of slow- and fast - rotating single protoneutron stars ( pnss ) .",

    "the form of the artificial viscosity tensor is oriented at riemann solvers @xcite .",
    "the resulting equations are similar to those constructed for riemann solutions of compressible fluid dynamics . in order to apply the artificial viscosity terms only where they are really needed ,",

    "our work starts from 3d sph simulations of bns mergers in an isolated binary system , made up of two individual neutron stars , each with a baryonic mass of 1.4(equivalent to a gravitational mass of @xmath41.3 ) , and separated by a distance of 48 km .",
    "their initial hydrostatic structure is computed by solving the newtonian equations .",
    "the properties of nuclear matter ( pressure , energy , entropy etc . )",

    "are then mapped onto the resulting density profiles these particles are further relaxed to find their true equilibrium state ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    because the tidal synchronization time exceeds the gravitational decay time , bnss can not be tidally locked during their inspiral phase , and are thus expected to be close to irrotational ( see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite . however , past investigations of the coalescence of bnss suggest that the intrinsic spin of each neutron star is an important parameter , as it determines , for example , the width of the baryon - poor funnel above the forming central object that is thought to play a decisive role in the launching of a grb ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . therefore , to encompass the range of possible outcomes ,",
    "we simulate three initial configurations : 1 ) no spins ( no intrinsic neutron star spin ) , 2 ) co - rotating spins ( each neutron star has a period equal to that of the orbit , and rotates in the same direction ) , and 3 ) counter - rotating spins ( same spin period as for co - rotating spins , but with rotation in a reverse direction to that of the orbit ; the spins are counter - aligned ) . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we broadly refer to these models as the no - spin , the co - rotating spin , and the counter - rotating spin bns models .",
    "the co - rotating and counter - rotating cases are included here to bracket the range of possibilities , but they represent unlikely extremes .",
    "we leave to future work the consideration of higher mass bns mergers @xcite or asymmetric systems @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "we post - process these 3d sph simulations by constructing azimuthal - averages , selecting a time after coalescence ( when the two neutron stars come into contact ) of 10.0 ( no - spins ) , 12.4 ( co - rotating spins ) , and 20.4ms ( counter - rotating spins ) , corresponding in each vulcan/2d simulations to the time origin . at these times",
    ", these systems are evolving towards , but have not yet reached , complete axisymmetric configurations .",
    "this is a compromise made to model with vulcan/2d the epoch of peak neutrino brightness . at these initial times",
    ", the amount of mass with a density greater than 10@xmath26gcm@xmath7 is 2.5 in the no - spin bns model , 2.31 in the co - rotating spin model , and 2.43 in the counter - rotating spin model . in the same model order , and at these times",
    ", the mass contained inside the @xmath413 km radius of the highest mass neutron star allowed by the shen eos is only 1.11 , 1.26 , and 1.03 .",
    "the sph simulations employed to generate these models are newtonian , and , thus , one would expect more mass at small radii and systematically higher densities if allowance for gr effects were made , but the use of the highly - incompressible shen eos together with the significant amount of mass in quasi - keplerian motion and on wide orbits suggests that the systems should survive at least for some time before the general - relativistic gravitational instability occurs .",
    "starting from fluid variables constructed with azimuthal averages of the 3d sph simulations described above , we follow the evolution of three bns merger configurations with the mgfld radiation - hydrodynamics code vulcan/2d @xcite .",
    "the gravitational potential is assumed newtonian and computed using a multipole solver @xcite . due to the difficulty of handling the superluminal alfvn speeds prevailing in the low - density material surrounding the bns merger for even modest field strengths",
    ", we do not investigate the dependence on magnetic field strength and morphology .",
    "however , our study presents a self - consistent treatment of neutrino emission , scattering , and absorption in a multi - species mgfld context .",
    "associated neutrino - matter coupling source terms are included in the momentum and energy conservation equations and their relevance to the merger evolution is , thus , computed explicitly , for a typical duration of @xmath0100ms .",
    "for these dynamical calculations , we include all neutrino processes described in @xcite , but neglect the secondary processes of neutrino - electron scattering .",
    "the transport solution in the mgfld scheme we employ is solved for the three neutrino species @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and `` @xmath2 , '' ( which groups together the @xmath27 and @xmath28 neutrinos ) and at eight neutrino energies : 2.50 , 6.87 , 12.02 , 21.01 , 36.74 , 64.25 , 112.36 , 196.48mev .",
    "the energy spacing is constant in the log .",
    "the choice of spatial grid is determined primarily by the very aspherical density distribution of the merger and the very steep density drop - off at the neutron star surface in the polar direction .",

    "note that fast rotation in the inner region , although sub - keplerian , displaces the density maximum by 8 km from the center and along the equator in the no - spin bns model .",
    "these density peaks also correspond to extrema in the electron fraction of @xmath40.1 at this time .",
    "to setup the hybrid vulcan/2d grid , we position the transition radius between the inner cartesian and the outer spherical polar regions at 12 km .",
    "the density at this location is at all times in excess of 10@xmath30gcm@xmath7 , and thus  due to the stiffness of the shen eos in that regime ",
    "away from the regions of large density gradient .",
    "the resolution in this inner region is typically 200@xmath13200m@xmath31 , corresponding to @xmath32 zones in each ( cylindrical ) direction @xmath33 and @xmath34 from the center to the transition radius .",
    "beyond the transition radius , we use a logarithmically increasing radial grid spacing with @xmath35 = 1.85% , using 301 zones to 3000 km .",
    "the grid covers one hemisphere , from the rotation axis to the equator ( both treated as reflecting boundaries ) , and the computation assumes axisymmetry , i.e. , the azimuthal gradients are zero .",
    "we fill the grid outside the merger with material having a low density of 5@xmath1310@xmath36gcm@xmath7 and a low temperature of 4@xmath1310@xmath37k .",
    "below @xmath380.05 , we compute thermodynamic variables , as well as opacities / emissivities , by adopting an electron fraction of 0.05 . given the smooth variation for the corresponding quantitites ( pressure , entropy , mean - free path , etc . ) at this level of neutron richness , this approximation is expected to be quite good .    after the mgfld radiation - hydrodynamics simulations are completed , we post - process individual snapshots keeping the hydrodynamics frozen , and relaxing only the radiation quantities .",
    "this operation is performed for each model at 10ms intervals over the whole evolution using the multi - angle , @xmath21 , radiation - transport module discussed in @xcite and described more recently in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to those papers for details on the method and the nomenclature .",
    "this @xmath21 variant yields the explicit angular dependence of the neutrino specific intensity , and , thus , represents a more accurate modeling of the strongly anisotropic neutrino luminosity in such highly aspherical systems @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 calculation is done with the same number of energy groups ( i.e. , eight ) and on the same spatial grid . in the @xmath21 algorithm ,",
    "the transition at depth to mgfld described in @xcite is natural here , since it occurs at 12 km , and , thus , in regions where the densities are nuclear .",
    "however , the spatial resolution is not fully satisfactory at the neutron star surface and along the polar direction , a region where the density decreases by few orders of magnitude in just a few kilometers .",
    "this , thus , represents a challenge for radiation transport on our eulerian grid . in the first instance",
    ", we relax the mgfld results with @xmath21 adopting 8 @xmath39-angles . in the @xmath21 approach , @xmath40 such @xmath39-angles translate into @xmath41 directions mapping the unit sphere uniformly",
    ". once converged , we perform an accuracy check by remapping the angle - dependent neutrino radiation field from 8 to 16 @xmath39-angles , and then relaxing this higher angular resolution simulation . due to the increased computational costs , we use the high ( 16 @xmath39-angles ) angular - resolution configuration only for snapshots at 10 , 60 , and 100ms , but for all three bns merger configurations studied here .",
    "importantly , the explicit angle - dependence of the neutrino - radiation field allows us to compute its various moments , which we employ in a novel formulation of the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation rate (   [ annihil : sn ] ) .",
    "we find that these results compare favorably with the simpler approach of @xcite , although the multi - angle simulations offer a number of interesting new insights , which we explore in   [ sect : annihilate ] .",
    "in each model , the restart with vulcan/2d is followed by a transient phase that lasts a few milliseconds and that is characterized by high - frequency oscillations of the highest density material , located within 10 - 20 km of the center . given the good match between the shen eos used by rosswog and in this work ( pressures differ by at most a few percent ) , we speculate that these oscillations are caused in part by the glitch introduced through the azimuthal averaging of the 3d sph simulation snaphsot . however",
    ", they may also reflect a fundamental dynamical property of this early phase .",
    "similar oscillations are seen in 3d simulations performed with magma , and have also been reported in the literature , e.g. by @xcite .",
    "the associated shocks generate thermal energy ( note that the thermal part of the pressure is sub - dominant at nuclear densities ) , but this thermal component is negligible compared , for example , with what is needed to power the neutrino luminosities we see .",
    "any initial mismatch is thus merely a small transient which has a negligible impact on the long - term evolution of the bns mergers we study in this work .",
    "the evolutions of the bns merger models with initially no spins , co - rotating spins , and counter - rotating spins , are qualitatively similar .",
    "as discussed above , at the start of the vulcan simulations , the matter distribution is far from stationary , with a significant amount of material at sub - nuclear densities and at large distances from the center . throughout the @xmath4100ms of evolution",
    "we follow , matter in the inner few hundred kilometers settles in and comes to rest at the neutron star surface , while material beyond a few hundred kilometers and located at low , near equatorial latitudes , migrates outward due to the large thermal pressure gradient and the strong centrifugal effects .",
    "this expansion also takes place in the vertical direction , leading to the formation of a low - density cocoon surrounding an inner and denser disk . in the intermediate region",
    ", i.e. , at radii of 50100 km and along the equatorial direction , material evolves towards quasi - keplerian motion , with little inward or outward migration . in figs .",

    "in addition , an estimated rate of electron - type neutrino loss allows the electron fraction to be updated .",
    "overall , benchmarking of these leakage schemes using more sophisticated 1d core - collapse simulations that solve the boltzmann equation , suggests that the resulting neutrino luminosities are within a factor of a few at most of what would be obtained using a more accurate treatment .",

    "the co - rotating spin model has the weakest neutrino signal of all three , mainly because the tidal locking leads to a very smooth merger and correspondingly low temperatures ( the central temperature is about 10mev ) . specifically , the angle - integrated , species - integrated , peak neutrino luminosity for the bns model with no initial spin is 1.5@xmath1310@xmath17 ( 2.2@xmath1310@xmath48 , 7.0@xmath1310@xmath48 , and 6.7@xmath1310@xmath48 ) , for the co - rotating spin model 1.2@xmath1310@xmath17 ( 2.2@xmath1310@xmath48 , 5.7@xmath1310@xmath48 , and 3.9@xmath1310@xmath48 ) , and for the counter - rotating spin model 2.2@xmath1310@xmath17ergs@xmath8 ( 2.9@xmath1310@xmath48 , 8.2@xmath1310@xmath48 , and 1.2@xmath1310@xmath17 ) .",

    "however , in all cases , cooling of the bns merger causes a decrease of all neutrino luminosities after the peak ( i.e. , rather than a long - term plateau ) , with a faster decline rate in the no - spin and counter - rotating spin cases . the luminosity decay rate is faster for the `` @xmath47 '' neutrinos than for the electron - type neutrinos .",
    "this translates into a strong decrease of the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation rate due to its scaling with the square of the neutrino luminosity ( see   [ sect : annihilate ] ) .",
    "in agreement with past work that focused on the initial 10 - 20ms after the onset of coalescence , we find that the electron antineutrino luminosity dominates over the electron neutrino luminosity , but in contrast with the work of @xcite and @xcite , our `` @xmath47 '' neutrino luminosities are at least one order of magnitude higher .",
    "we associate this discrepancy with their neglect of the nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung opacity and emission processes . moreover , in the no - spin and co - rotating spin cases , the relationships between the fluxes of the various neutrino flavors changes significantly with time , partly because they are differently affected by neutron star cooling and changes in neutron richness .",

    "these optical depths translate into diffusion times that are on the order of 10ms to 1s .",
    "the quasi - keplerian disk that extends from 2030 to 100 km is moderately optically - thick to neutrinos at the peak of the energy distribution ( i.e. , at 10 - 20mev ) .",
    "heat can thus leak out in the vertical direction over a typical diffusion time of a few tens of milliseconds ( see fig .",

    "this is comparable to the accretion time scale of the disk itself @xcite , which suggests that this neutrino energy is available to power relativistic ejecta , and is not advected inwards with the gas , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "compared to pnss formed in the `` standard '' core - collapse of a massive star , smnss formed through coalescence have a number of contrasting properties : 1 ) most of the material is at nuclear density , unlike in pnss where newly accreted material deposited at the pns surface radiates its thermal energy as it contracts and cools ; 2 ) most of the material is neutron rich , thereby diminishing the radiation of electron - type neutrinos in favor of antielectron - type neutrinos . in pnss , electron - type neutrinos are an important cooling agent , but have large opacities . in smnss , the material is strongly deleptonized and electron - type neutrinos are non - degenerate .",
    "they suffer relatively lower opacity and can therefore diffuse out more easily .",
    "the opacity of other neutrino species is even lower and therefore more prone to energy leakage through radiation ; 3 ) energy gain through accretion is modest since there is merely a few 0.1of material outside of the smns . in our three merger models ,",
    "the internal energy budget of such shear - heated smnss is @xmath010@xmath17erg , half of which is thermal energy . with a total neutrino luminosity of @xmath45@xmath1310@xmath48ergs@xmath8 ,",
    "the cooling time scale for these smns should be on the order of a second .",
    "this is significantly , but not dramatically , shorter than the 10 - 30s cooling time scale of hot pnss , i.e the time it takes these objects to radiate a total of @xmath43@xmath1310@xmath17erg of internal energy .",
    "a fraction of the diffusing core energy is absorbed through charge - current reactions ( with associated volume - integrated energy @xmath61 ) and turned into internal energy in a `` gain '' layer at the surface of the smns , primarily on the pole - facing side and at high - latitudes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_netgain ] ) .",
    "this neutrino energy deposition is the origin of a thermally - driven wind whose properties we now describe .      a few milliseconds after the start of our simulations and onset of the burst of neutrinos from the bns merger , a neutrino - driven wind develops .",

    "[ fig_netgain ] , the energy gain / losses due to neutrino in the polar direction is mostly net heating , with no presence of a sizable net cooling region . in fig .",
    "[ fig_wind ] , we show this evolution for the no - spin bns merger model for four selected times : 10 , 30 , 60 , and 100ms .",
    "one can see the initial transient feature , which advects out and eventually leaves the grid .",
    "this transient phase is not caused by neutrino energy deposition , but is rather due to infall at small radii and in the polar regions of the ambient medium we placed around the merged object , as well as due to the sound waves generated by the core during the initial quakes .",

    "the side lobes of the smns confine the ejecta at radii @xmath5500 km to a small angle of @xmath420@xmath62 about the poles , but this opening angle grows at largers distances to @xmath490@xmath62 .",
    "the confinement at small radii also leads to the entrainment of material from the side lobes , overloading the wind and making it choke .",

    "thus , `` r - process material '' will feed the interstellar medium through this neutrino - driven wind .",
    "this latitudinal variation of the electron fraction at large distances is controlled by the relative strength of the angle- and time - dependent @xmath3 and @xmath1 neutrino luminosities , the expansion timescale of the `` wind '' parcels , and the neutron richness at their launching site @xcite . along the pole and at the smns surface ,",
    "the low - density , high neutron - richness , and relatively stronger @xmath3 neutrino luminosities at late times in the no - spin and co - rorotating spin models lead to a high asymptotic @xmath22 value ( high proton - richness ) . despite the relatively high resolution employed in our simulations ( @xmath4300 m in the radial direction at @xmath420 km )",
    ", higher resolution would be needed to resolve this region accurately .",
    "although we expect this trend would hold at higher resolution , it would likely yield lower asymptotic values of the electron fraction along the pole .",
    "along the equatorial direction , low @xmath22 material ( @xmath40.1 - 0.2 ) migrates outward , but its velocity is below the local escape speed and it is unclear how much will eventually escape to infinity .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_rhov_lat ] where we show the angular variation of the density and velocity at 2900 km in the no - spin bns model , at 121ms .",
    "the bns merger is thus cloaked along the poles by material with a density in excess of 10@xmath60gcm@xmath7 , while along lower latitudes even denser material from the side lobes obstructs the view from the center of the smns .",

    "baryon loading of relativistic ejecta is a recognized problem in the production of a grb , but this is the first time the neutrino - driven wind , the baryon polluter , has been simulated dynamically .",
    "all three bns merger simulations we performed reveal the birth of a thermally - driven wind through neutrino energy deposition in a gain layer at the surface , and primarily at high latitudes .",

    "moreover , such baryonic pollution along the polar direction may affect any subsequent relativistic ejecta , although the wind from the smns may last for only a short time , perhaps 100ms .",
    "travelling at a tenth the speed of light , it will reach only out to 0.01 light - second , thus much shorter than the duration of short grbs .",
    "this initial wind phase can not provide the sustained confinement needed for the potential relativistic ejecta .",
    "although we focus on the phase prior to black hole formation , a neutrino - driven wind may blow after the black hole forms too , but this time from the surrounding hot and dense torus , and driven by charge - current neutrino absorption at the disk surface .",
    "importantly , because of the centrifugal barrier felt by particles coming in from sizable orbits in the disk , these injected baryons should remain away from the polar region , while neutrino - antineutrino annihilation would continue to contribute along the rotation axis of the smns , but now in an essentially baryon - free environment .",
    "this provides an attractive mechanism for confinement , since neutrino emission would yield both the power source for the relativistic ejecta ( caused by neutrino - antineutrino annihilation ) and the confined neutrino - driven wind ( caused by charge - current reactions ) . in the future",
    ", we will investigate the neutrino signatures that obtain in the context where the compact object is a black hole , and only the surrounding torus material radiates neutrinos .",
    "such a disk wind would offer a natural confining ingredient for any relativistic ejecta propelled along the rotation axis and powered by annihilation of neutrinos and antineutrinos radiated from the disk , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the huge amount of free energy of rotation , on the order of 10@xmath48erg in the supermassive neutron star and its torus disk , together with millisecond orbital periods , suggest that the magneto - rotational instability could play a major role in redistributing angular momentum , leading to solid - body rotation , and increasing the magnetic pressure in the corresponding layers by orders of magnitude .",
    "magneto - rotational effects should be strong and would lead to a considerably stronger neutrino - driven wind , as in the aic of white dwarfs @xcite , and delay the formation of a black hole .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that in collapsar candidates @xcite , the large amount of free energy of rotation in their iron core at the time of collapse can lead to a magnetically - driven explosion , associated with very large mass loss rates which may compete with the mass accretion rate from the torus disk and jeopardize the formation of a black hole .",
    "by contrast with such collapsar models , supermassive neutron stars formed from merger events are unambiguously endowed with a large rotational energy budget ( stored in the orbital motion ) , of which a large fraction is differential and may be tapped .",
    "hence , the phase prior to black hole formation should be modeled at very high resolution and in combination with neutrino transport to address these issues .",

    ", our choice of models extends from the quasi - spherical s20.nr model , to the mildly oblate s20.@xmath102 model , and finally to the strongly oblate ( with a disk - like extension ) aic model . in all three models ,",
    "the @xmath21 neutrino radiation field was computed with 16 @xmath39-angles . including the @xmath171 direction , a total number of 144 angles were treated , following the prescription described in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu_nubar ] , we present 2d colormaps of the spatial distribution of the energy deposition by @xmath168 annihilation in the three model snapshots considered here .",
    "we draw as white the regions of high density ( @xmath172  @xmath010@xmath64gcm@xmath7 ) where equilibration via charged - current interactions is fast , as well as regions in which cooling by charged - current interactions dominates .",
    "any energy input by neutrino pair annihilation in these regions is overwhelmed by cooling through charged - current processes and does not contribute to the net neutrino gain .",
    "note also that we do not show the distribution for the `` @xmath173 , '' because it is qualitatively similar to that of @xmath168 , being merely weaker , i.e. , with a volume - integrated magnitude that is a factor of about ten smaller .    in the non - rotating model s20.nr ,",
    "the @xmath174 distribution is approximately spherically symmetric , tracing regions of high neutrino energy density in the neutrino - diffuse postshock region , and peaking near the lower edge of the gain region around @xmath495 km .",
    "the @xmath168 process dominates over that for `` @xmath173 , '' because the benefit of the favorable `` @xmath2 '' neutrino luminosity is more than cancelled by the @xmath45 times smaller `` @xmath173 '' cross sections and by the smaller decoupling radii for `` @xmath2 '' neutrinos , yielding systematically smaller collision angles .    in the 160ms postbounce snapshot of model s20.nr",
    ", @xmath163 falls off radially as @xmath175 ( both for @xmath168 and the `` @xmath173 '' annihilations ) , which is slightly steeper than the theoretical estimate @xmath176 for @xmath177 made by goodman et al .",
    "we find and list in table  [ table : nunubar ] volume - integrated energy deposition rates of 1.30@xmath1310@xmath15 and 0.35@xmath1310@xmath15ergs@xmath8 for @xmath168 and  @xmath178  annihilation processes , respectively .",
    "these rates are more than two orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with the net gain from charged - current reactions , which amount to 2.14@xmath1310@xmath63ergs@xmath8 at that time . at 500ms after bounce in the s20.nr model , the energy deposition rates have declined to 0.77@xmath1310@xmath15 and 0.12@xmath1310@xmath15ergs@xmath8 for @xmath168 and  @xmath178  annihilation , respectively . at this time , we measure a more rapid radial fall - off @xmath179 for radii @xmath5100 km and somewhat shallower decline @xmath180 for larger radii .",
    "these results echo the steep decrease with time of the annihilation rate found for the bns mergers discussed in this paper , suggesting that neutrino - cooled compact objects are quickly weakening neutrino - annihilation power sources in the absence of energy sources such as shear heating in a differentially - rotating disk @xcite .",
    "our results for model s20.nr support the conclusions of previous studies ( cooperstein et al . 1986,1987 ; janka 1991 ) that argued that @xmath181 annihilation contributes little to the neutrino heating in quasi - spherical postbounce supernova cores .",
    "gr effects ( bending of neutrino geodesics and redshift ) , which yield larger annihilation rates for very compact configurations @xcite are most likely irrelevant at the large radii at which annihilation may have any significance in our models .",
    "@xmath164 is already as low as @xmath40.02 at the inner edge of the polar gain region in models s20.nr and s20.@xmath102 and not larger than @xmath40.06 in the aic snapshot .",
    "model s20.@xmath102 is rapidly rotating and has large pole - equator neutrino flux asymmetries @xcite .",
    "though prolate and quickly varying with radius , the @xmath163 distributions in model s20.@xmath102 do not vary with angle by more than a factor of 2 ( neglecting for now the large equatorial cooling regions between @xmath4100 and 200 km ) . along the poles ,",
    "charged - current losses negate net energy deposition by @xmath11 annihilation at radii @xmath580 km .",
    "again , @xmath182 dominates over @xmath183``@xmath173 '' ) , while both decrease with radius by @xmath184 at 160ms after bounce and @xmath185 at 550ms after bounce .",
    "as listed in table  [ table : nunubar ] , we find at 160ms after bounce volume - integrated energy depositions of 1.03@xmath1310@xmath15 and 0.41@xmath1310@xmath15ergs@xmath8 , for @xmath168 and `` @xmath173 , '' respectively . at 550ms after bounce , these values have decreased to 0.29@xmath1310@xmath15 ( @xmath168 ) and 0.12@xmath1310@xmath15  ergs  s@xmath8 ( `` @xmath173 '' ) .",

    "[ fig : nu_nubar ] shows the energy deposition by @xmath168 annihilation in the aic model at 160ms after bounce ( see @xcite for details ) . in this rapidly rotating oblate pns ( the central period is @xmath42.2  ms at this post - bounce time ) , neutrinos are emitted from both the central object and its extended moderately hot equatorial disk - like structure ( more specifically from the pole - facing side of these side lobes ) .",
    "significant energy deposition by neutrino pairs occurs at small radii in a wide polar wedge of @xmath460@xmath186 ( widening with radius to @xmath4120@xmath186 ) and @xmath182 reaches peak rates near the pns surface at @xmath415 km of up to 10@xmath121ergcm@xmath7  s@xmath8 , with @xmath183``@xmath173''@xmath122 being globally smaller by an order of magnitude .",
    "the radial decline of @xmath163 along the polar direction becomes shallower with time , with power - law exponents varying from @xmath4 - 8.3 to @xmath4 - 5.8 from 160 to 773ms after bounce .",
