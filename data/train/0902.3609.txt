    "generally , the density matrix evolution is governed by a master equation whose unitary part contains the dynamics as given by the system hamiltonian and the non - unitary dissipator describes the effects that the environment has on the system .",
    "the presence of the environment leads to decoherence which is harmful for practical applications like quantum information processing  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", decoherence has a role in open fundamental problems of quantum physics such as quantum to classical transition  @xcite .",
    "often , the environment is seen to have unavoidable effects on the system dynamics .",
    "however , the recently developed ability to control quantum systems and the implementation of reservoir engineering techniques are revising the role of the environment  @xcite .",
    "this may lead to new ways to control the system of interest indirectly via the control of the system  reservoir interaction and the properties of the environment .    in memoryless markovian open systems ,",
    "the environment acts as a sink for the system information .",
    "due to the system - reservoir interaction , the system of interest loses information on its state into the environment , and this lost information does not play any further role in the system dynamics .",
    "however , if the environment has a non - trivial structure , then the seemingly lost information can return to the system at a later time leading to non - markovian dynamics with memory .",
    "this memory effect is the essence of non - markovian dynamics .",
    "non - markovian systems appear in many branches of physics , such as quantum optics  @xcite , solid state physics  @xcite , quantum chemistry  @xcite , and quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "recently , non - markovian features has also been exploited in the context of biomolecules where the environment consists of protein solvents  @xcite .",
    "however , the elusive nature of non - markovian dynamics makes it often difficult to obtain insight into microscopical physical processes governing the time evolution . at the same time",
    "the complex mathematical structure of the non - markovian models prevents generally to solve the dynamics of the system of interest .",
    "hence , new ways to describe non - markovianity and new methods to solve non - markovian dynamics are highly desired .",
    "the density matrix can also be seen as a collection , or ensemble , of state vectors .",
    "then , the interaction between the system and the reservoir removes the precise information about the specific state vector to describe the system state . instead",
    ", the state of the open system is associated with an ensemble of state vectors where each state vector has a certain ( classical ) probability of appearance .",
    "this view has led to the development of monte carlo simulation methods for markovian  @xcite and non - markovian  @xcite open systems . in these methods , the time evolution of each state vector in the ensemble",
    "contains a stochastic element which can be discontinuous ( quantum jump )  @xcite or continuous ( quantum state diffusion )  @xcite .",
    "one of the most common methods to treat markovian dynamics is the monte carlo wave function ( mcwf ) method which exploits quantum jumps  @xcite .",
    "however , a generalization of this markovian method to non - markovian regime has turned out to be a challenging problem .",
    "the central obstacle has been the appearance of negative quantum jump probabilities due to the temporarily negative decay rates of non - markovian dynamics .",
    "earlier approaches to this problem exploit auxiliary extensions of the hilbert space of the system  @xcite or exploit the state of the total system  @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown that the jump - like unravelling of non - markovian master equations is possible within the hilbert space of the system , and hence the auxiliary extension of the system hilbert space is not necessarily needed  @xcite .",
    "the key feature of the developed non - markovian quantum jump ( nmqj ) method is the notion that , when the decay rates appearing in the master equation become negative , the direction of the information flow between the system and the reservoir gets reversed . during the initial positive decay region ,",
    "the information flows from the system to the environment , while during the negative decay the system may regain some of the information it lost earlier . in terms of quantum jumps",
    "this means that the seemingly lost superpositions in the ensemble can be restored .",
    "this leads to new insight into the concept of memory , which is the central ingredient of non - markovian dynamics .",
    "we also describe in detail the positive and negative factors affecting the numerical performance of the method .",
    "the ultimate limit for the numerical performance is given by the effective ensemble size @xmath0 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] ) since the method needs to evolve simultaneously @xmath0 state vectors .",
    "our results help to explain why local - in - time master equations @xcite can indeed describe systems with memory and the results also show the presence of some counterintuitive features of non - markovian dynamics . in this regime ,",
    "the rate of the process is proportional to the target state , instead of the source state , and hence challenges the classical view .",
    "we show here two different proofs of the equivalence between the algorithm and the master equation , discuss in detail how the method works , and apply it to multi - level atom schemes .",
    "recently , the existence of a measurement scheme interpretation of non - markovian dynamics has been actively discussed  @xcite .",

    "we can summarize the key factors for the numerical performance of the nmqj method as follows : ( i ) no hilbert space extensions are needed , ( ii ) the identification of the negative rate process as reverse jumps which keeps @xmath0 constant during the negative decay region and allows to technical optimization of the simulations ( iii ) the computational cost increases when the number of terms in the summation ( [ eq : rho2 ] ) increases .",
    "the first two points allow to improve the efficiency while the third point is expected to set the ultimate limit for the required computational resources .",
    "in addition of this resource limit , there exists also non - markovian systems for which it is very challenging to derive local - in - time master equations of the form ( [ eq : mnm ] ) .",
    "an example of this type of the system is a driven two - level atom in a photonic band gap material . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there does not yet exist local - in - time master equations of the form ( [ eq : mnm ] ) for this system . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to simulate this system already , e.g. , with the method developed by jack and hope  @xcite which exploits memory functions and virtual density matrices .    in the quantum state diffusion ( qsd )",
    "method  @xcite , to obtain the operator giving the stochastic evolution of state vectors , one needs to perform a memory kernel integration combined with a functional derivative of the state vector with respect to the noise . in the nmqj method",
    "the corresponding step goes in a fundamentally different way since the simulation produces its own non - markovian quantum jump operator .",
    "this acts by transferring the ensemble members between the existing states in a stochastic way [ c.f .",
    "( [ eq : jop ] ) ] .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the qsd method by definition has continuous stochastic evolution of state vectors .",
    "this means that in the qsd simulation @xmath219 . for nmqj method ,",
    "when the complexity of the system to be treated increases , also @xmath0 increases . in the ultimate limit when the number of different state vectors is very large , or even approaches infinity ,",
    "then there does not exist the optimization scheme for nmqj method based on @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", the simulations also become more tedious due to the increasing number of state vectors which need to evolved simultaneously .    in general",
    "the derivation of local - in - time master equation for driven systems is a very challenging problem in the theory of non - markovian open quantum systems .",
    "we believe that the main difficulties here are the condition of very strong driving affecting the system dynamics in the short non - markovian time - scale , and the case of a very strong coupling between the system and the reservoir . in the latter case ,",
    "the existence of a time - local generator of the reduced system dynamics is not in general guaranteed ( see section 9.2.1 of ref .",
    "hence , it is worth keeping in mind that the applicability of our method depends on this issue , since our starting point is the local - in - time master equation  ( [ eq : mnm ] ) .",
    "we have shown that , starting from a general local - in - time master equation , it is possible to describe the dynamics of a non - markovian open system with an ensemble of stochastic pure state evolutions with quantum jumps .",
    "the developed non - markovian quantum jump method ( nmqj ) demonstrates that it is indeed possible to unravel non - markovian master equations with quantum jumps without making any auxiliary extensions to the hilbert space of the system as done in the jump descriptions developed earlier  @xcite .",
    "our approach allows a rather simple and insightful description of non - markovian dynamics . even though the method allows to optimize the simulations in terms of using the effective ensemble size",
    "@xmath220 , this number increases with complexity of the system under study .",
    "this sets the limit for the performance of the method since @xmath0 state vectors need to be evolved simultaneously .    the nmqj method developed here generalizes a widely used markovian mcwf method  @xcite into the non - markovian regime .",
    "due to the existence of the negative decay rates for non - markovian systems , the mcwf method leads to negative quantum jump probabilities . we have discovered the corresponding jump process which has positive probability . due to the memory of the system ,",
    "this non - markovian quantum jump essentially acts as a reverse jump , and allows the system to recover the information lost earlier .",
    "the consequence is that in the ensemble of pure states forming the density matrix , the seemingly lost superpositions can be restored . during the time evolution ,",
    "jump  reverse - jump cycles can occur in the ensemble members : the first jump during the positive decay destroys quantum superposition while the second jump in the negative decay region restores them .",
    "our results shed new light on the non - markovian dynamics in several ways . breaking the density matrix evolution into an ensemble of state vectors with quantum jumps",
    "allows to understand how the density matrix carries the information on the earlier state of the system , and how the memory affects the system dynamics .",
    "this helps to clarify how local - in - time master equations are able to describe non - markovian dynamics .",
    "quantum mechanics reveals often counterintuitive features . here , the rate of the process appearing in the non - markovian region is directly proportional to the target state of the process",
    "this is opposite to the classical view where typically the rate of a given process is given by the source state .",
    "our analysis reveals in detail this counterintuitive feature of non - markovian dynamics which is also present in the unravelled master equation .",
    "it has been shown earlier that markovian open system dynamics with mcwf trajectories can be formally described as a piecewise deterministic stochastic process of general probability theory  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we can ask what is the corresponding formal stochastic process for the nmqj state evolutions  @xcite .",
    "this holds a promise to exploit new stochastic process which may allow the ingredients and insight by our nmqj method to be taken outside the field of open systems to a more general level .",

    "115982 ) , the magnus ehrnrooth foundation , the visl foundation , and the turku collegium of science and medicine .",
    "we thank h .-",
    "breuer , b. garraway , and j. gambetta for stimulating discussions .",
    "where we have weighted , as usual , the deterministic evolution with the no - jump probability and the jump paths with the corresponding jump probabilities . above",
    ", we have the following quantities : @xmath223 is the jump probability of the state @xmath14 for positive channel @xmath62 @xmath224 @xmath225 is the reverse jump probability of state @xmath14 via the negative channel @xmath63 to the state @xmath80 @xmath226 the reverse jump operator from the state @xmath227 via channel @xmath63 to the state @xmath228 is @xmath229          in eq .",
    "( [ eq : algo ] ) , the jump probabilities for the positive channel , appearing in the numerator and the denominator in the no - jump path , cancel each other when doing the series expansion in @xmath12 and keeping the terms to first order .",
    "the jump part to positive channels gives the positive channel `` sandwich term '' of the master equation in the usual way .",
    "we have written here explicitly the @xmath234-functional which gives the condition for the reverse jump : one can go via channel @xmath63 from @xmath17 to @xmath228 on the condition that @xmath235 .",
    "( [ eq : laststep ] ) , the last two lines cancel each other .",
    "this happens because the @xmath234-functional takes care of the @xmath83 summation in the last line and the summation over @xmath83 and @xmath84 are equivalent procedures making the two terms equal with opposite signs . the first and second line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : laststep ] ) are equal . in the second line the @xmath234-functional with summation over",
    "@xmath83 means replacing @xmath236 with @xmath237 giving the sandwich term of the master equation in the first line .",
    "thus we have proven the equivalence between the master equation and the algorithm .",
    "the proof can be summarized in the following way : the deterministic part gives the commutator and anticommutator parts of the master equation , the positive channels go in the usual way : the jump part giving the corresponding sandwich term of the master equation .",
    "for negative channels the change in the norm and jumps cancel and the jump probability of negative channels times the deterministic evolution gives the sandwich terms .",
