    "photonic crystals are periodic dielectric composite structures that forbid propagation of electromagnetic waves , in any direction and for any polarization , for a certain frequency range , called the photonic band gap ( pbg ) .",
    "pbgs are characterized by two quantities : the width of the bandgap and the midgap frequency .",
    "the characteristics of pbgs in periodic dielectric structures depend on the dielectric contrast between the composites , the symmetry and topology of the structure and the filling factor , the ratio between the volume occupied by each dielectric with respect to the total volume of the composite",
    ".    many applications of photonic crystals are in the visible ( 400 - 700 nm ) or near - infrared wavelength ( 700 - 1300 nm ) range  @xcite .",
    "finding three - dimensional ( 3d ) photonic structures with a large absolute band gap in the visual or near - infrared frequency range and suitable for large - scale production is therefore highly desirable . because of the sub - micrometer resolution required in the production technology , manufacturing these 3d photonic crystals is a great challenge .",
    "techniques involved in the manufacturing process of the pbg materials include microfabrication , microlithography , self - assembly methods , weaving of dielectric fibers and the glancing angle deposition technique  @xcite .    in the two last decades",
    "several 3d photonic crystal architectures have been proposed and/or produced . amongst them",
    "are the criss - crossing pore structures ( inverse diamond lattice of overlapping air spheres in a high dielectric background )  @xcite , the woodpile structure  @xcite , inverse opal structures  @xcite , circular spiral structures  @xcite , structures from woven dielectric fibers  @xcite , square spiral structures  @xcite , self - assemblies of metal nanospheres  @xcite and bicontinuous cubic microstructures  @xcite . in self - assembling systems many cubic phases with various symmetries and topologies have been discovered , see for example refs .",
    "however , the list of the experimentally identified cubic phases may be incomplete because the analysis of the scattering patterns of these complex structures can be very difficult  @xcite . in self - assembling systems the gyroid structure with @xmath2 symmetry is observed quite often .",
    "mesoporous solids ( silicas ) exhibiting these gyroid morphologies have also been obtained  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that these structures have potential as pbg materials  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , it has been shown theoretically that these double gyroid structures do not exhibit a pbg  @xcite .",
    "the more simple cubic structures such as the p ( @xmath3 ) , d ( @xmath4 ) and g(@xmath5 ) structures can develop pbgs  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the band gaps for a large variety of triply periodic bicontinuous cubic structures : the p , d , g , c(p ) , c(d ) , y , c(y ) , @xmath6y , c(@xmath6y ) , c(y@xmath1)=c(g ) , s , c(s ) , i - wp , f - rd , i@xmath0-y@xmath1 , c(i@xmath0-y@xmath1 ) , and l  @xcite structures and the p , d and g tubular structures .",
    "thereby we focus on the influence of the symmetry and topology of the dielectric structure on the appearance of a pbg .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes how we generate the different periodic dielectric structures and how we calculate the pbgs . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "in mesoscopic self - assembled bicontinuous cubic structures , interfaces separate adjacent regions of different composition .",
    "these interfaces are triply periodic , i.e. they have a 3d bravais lattice , and are often called intermaterial dividing surfaces ( imds ) .",
    "imds can be approximated by constant mean curvature surfaces which can be modelled by level surfaces  @xcite .",
    "single level surfaces , dividing space into two infinite , connected but disjunct regions , are defined by  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the positions of atoms in the crystal structure and @xmath12 denotes the length of the crystallographic cell , the smallest cube generating space by the lattice  @xcite . @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the phase angle and the structure factor amplitude , reflecting the symmetry of the structure , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 determines the volume fraction of the two regions , or labyrinths . for @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) defines the nodal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "they are used as approximations to the triply periodic minimal surfaces , surfaces for which the mean curvature is zero at every point . note that @xmath16 does not always divide space in two regions of equal volume .",
    "the labyrinth volume of the single level surfaces decreases monotonically with increasing absolute value of @xmath15  @xcite . at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , the surfaces `` pinch - off '' , i.e. become disconnected .",
    "they do no longer subdivide space into two continuous subvolumes but reduce to a lattice of closed - packed units with a given symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the pinching off behavior , and hence the change in topology can be controlled by considering the skeletal graphs of triply periodic surfaces generated using level set methods  @xcite .",
    "after the surfaces pinched - off , they disappear completely for some @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "the two regions defined by the single level surfaces are not simply connected .",
    "they interpenetrate each other in a complicated way .",
    "the topological complexity of the level surfaces can be characterized by the genus @xmath22",
    "the genus counts the number of handles , i.e. the number of holes in the closed surface .",
    "a finite surface of genus g is the topological equivalent of a sphere with g handles .",
    "the genus of a sphere is zero , whereas the genus of a torus with one hole is one . in what follows",
    "we give the genus for the crystallographic cell .",
    "the genus is computed using the integral - geometry morphological image analysis method  @xcite .",
    "the two labyrinths may differ in shape or there may exist symmetry operations mapping one labyrinth onto the other . for the case of the pbg structures we consider the two regions to consist of material with a different dielectric constant .",
    "this makes the two labyrinths always distinguishable , even if they have the same shape .",
    "the symmetry properties of the level surface structures are therefore described by the crystallographic space group that does not include symmetry operations which would interchange the different dielectric regions .",
    "the pbg properties of dielectric structures with imds that can be modelled by p , d , g minimal  @xcite and level surfaces  @xcite have been studied previously for a dielectric contrast of 13 . in this paper",
    "we report on band gap calculations for periodic dielectric structures defined by the single level surfaces p , d , g , c(p ) , c(d ) , y , c(y ) , @xmath6y , c(@xmath6y ) , c(y@xmath1)=c(g ) , s , c(s ) , i - wp , f - rd , i@xmath0-y@xmath1 , c(i@xmath0-y@xmath1 ) , and l  @xcite and by the skeletal graphs of the p , d and g minimal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "since the i - wp , f - rd , i@xmath0-y@xmath1 , c(i@xmath0-y@xmath1 ) and l surfaces for @xmath16 do not divide space in two regions of equal volume , we investigate both the direct and the inverse dielectric structures defined by these surfaces .",
    "the cubic periodic dielectric structures consist of @xmath23 unit cells of length @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the unit of length , and are characterized by magnetic permeability @xmath26 and dielectric constant @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the dielectric constant of the background and structure , respectively .",
    "we choose the dielectric constant of the structure material to be that of si ( @xmath30 )  @xcite and the one of the background material to be that of air ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the volume fraction or filling ratio of the dielectric material forming the background and structure are denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "varying the parameter @xmath15 changes @xmath33 and @xmath32 and hence the composition of the material .",
    "the inverse structures are defined by @xmath34    for the various periodic dielectric structures we obtain the band gap maps , showing the band gap width as a function of the volume fraction @xmath33 , from the computation of the density of states ( dos ) , or eigenvalue distribution .",
    "the dos is calculated using an unconditionally stable finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method to solve the time - dependent maxwell equations  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm used is the t4s2 algorithm and the algorithm - specific parameters are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( see refs .",
    "the width of the bandgap is defined as the width @xmath38 of the frequency range of the bandgap divided by the midgap frequency @xmath39 and is expressed in percentages .",
    "angular frequencies are given in units of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "in tables i - iv we give the equations for the direct and inverse level surface structures together with 3d renderings of 2x2x2 unit cubes of the structures for various values of @xmath15 . note that the equations for the direct and inverse structures are the same .",
    "the structures become different through eq.(2 ) and eq.(3 ) for the direct and inverse structure , repectively . the interval of @xmath15 values",
    "is chosen such that the endpoints approximate the @xmath15 values for pinch - off of the surface and such that the range of @xmath15 values for which the structures show a pbg is covered .",
    "as can be seen from tables i - iv the length of these intervals can be quite different for the various level surface structures .",
    "the corresponding volume fractions @xmath33 are also given .",
    "the structures are listed in the order of increasing index of their space group  @xcite ( see also table v ) and not in order of appearance in the text .",
    "we first consider the p , d and g level surface structures . for the p surface a family of connected level surfaces exists for @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath33 values between 0.14 and 0.86 , where we calculated the volume fractions @xmath33 by means of the morphological image analysis method  @xcite .",
    "the d level surface family exists from a volume fraction @xmath33 of 0.16 to 0.84 corresponding to @xmath15 values between 0 and @xmath43 .",
    "the g level surfaces pinch - off at @xmath44 which corresponds to values of @xmath33 of 0.02 and 0.98 .",
    "fig.[fig : levsurf1 ] shows the band gap maps for the p , d and g level surface structures",
    ". gaps for a broad range of volume fractions are observed for the p , d and g structures , in agreement with the results presented in ref .  @xcite . for the p structure a gap",
    "is found for volume fractions @xmath33 in the range 12 - 33 % , corresponding to @xmath15 values between -1.50 and -0.60 .",
    "note that for @xmath45 the structure is disconnected and consists of `` spheres '' on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the largest gap @xmath46 is found for a volume fraction of approximately 24% .",
    "the corresponding midgap frequency @xmath47 .",
    "a pbg is absent for @xmath48 ( @xmath16 ) , in agreement with refs .",
    "the band gap maps for d and g level surface structures show that compared to the p structure , the d and g structures have gaps for a much broader range of volume fractions .",
    "the maximum value for the d and g level structures is reached for volume fractions of 0.25 ( @xmath49 ) and 0.21 ( @xmath50 ) , respectively . for the d ( g ) structure @xmath51 ( 21.7% ) and @xmath52 ( 0.474 ) .",
    "comparison of the band gap maps in fig.1 with the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the pbgs in fig.1 close at slightly lower filling fractions .",
    "this may be due to the fact that we have chosen a lower dielectric contrast between the media .",
    "in general , lowering the dielectric contrast decreases the band gap width .",
    "in contrast to the numerical method used in ref .  @xcite our method puts accurate bounds on the gap , even at low volume fractions .",
    "hence the band gap maps in fig.[fig : levsurf1 ] for the p and d level surface structures close , in contrast to the ones shown in ref .",
    "the maximum value for the bandgap widths , the midgap frequency and the corresponding filling fractions are summarized in table v.    as mentioned above the characteristics of a band gap not only depend on the dielectric contrast and the volume fractions of the two media but also on the symmetry and the topology of the structure .",
    "the p , d and g level surfaces have @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 symmetry , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the p surface has genus 3 , the d surface has @xmath53 and the g surface has @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of interest to repeat the band gap analysis for level surface structures having the same symmetry but with different topologies .",
    "we first consider the space group @xmath3  @xcite of the p surface to which also the c(p ) and i - wp surfaces belong  @xcite .",
    "the c(p ) level surfaces with @xmath53 pinch - off at @xmath55 which corresponds to values of @xmath33 of 0.28 and 0.72 .",
    "these volume fractions are relatively high compared to the volume fraction at which the largest pbg for the p structure occurs . for the i - wp surface , which has genus 7 , a family of connected level surfaces exists for @xmath56 , corresponding to @xmath33 values between 0.10 and 0.99 .",
    "band gap calculations for both structures show no gap at any volume fraction for @xmath57 .",
    "since for the i - wp surface , @xmath16 does not divide space in regions of equal volume , we also study the inverse i - wp structure .",
    "also for this structure we find no pbg .",
    "hence , for the level surface structures with @xmath3 symmetry only the structure with the lowest genus , and hence the simplest topology , has a pbg .    a level surface which has the same symmetry as the d surface is the c(d ) surface  @xcite .",
    "the c(d ) level surface family only exists for relatively high volume fractions : @xmath58 corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    "the c(d ) surface has genus 121 . for the c(d ) surface , two different values for @xmath22 for the crystallographic cell",
    "can be found in the literature : @xmath60 as found by fisher _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for example , and @xmath61 as found by garstecki _",
    "et al . _",
    "this difference might be caused by the fact that fisher _ et al .",
    "_ have worked with minimal surfaces , while garstecki _",
    "et al . _ have used the nodal approximations , as we do in this work .",
    "the same reasoning can be applied to explain the fact that the c(d ) level surface does not divide space in regions of equal volume for @xmath16 , while the minimal c(d ) surface does  @xcite .",
    "our calculations indicate that the c(d ) structure shows no pbg .",
    "the c(y@xmath1)=c(g ) surface , also called the complementary gyroid  @xcite , has the same symmetry as the g surface and has @xmath62 . the c(y@xmath1)=c(g ) level surface family with @xmath62 exists from a volume fraction @xmath33 of 0.29 to 0.71 corresponding to @xmath15 values between 0.00 and @xmath63 . for larger @xmath64 values",
    "topologically new intermediate surfaces are formed before the pinching - off of the surface . for @xmath64 values between 2.15 and 3.32",
    "the surface changes into a surface with genus 5 , the same value as for the g surface . for @xmath64 values between 3.33 and 3.40",
    "the surface changes again into a surface with genus 29 .",
    "the surface finally pinches off at @xmath65 , corresponding to volume fractions of 0.16 and 0.84 . as can be seen from fig.[fig : levsurf2 ] , the c(y@xmath1 ) structure exhibits a gap for volume fractions @xmath33 in the range 11 - 38 % , corresponding to @xmath15 values between -4.00 and -1.25 .",
    "however , the largest part of the band gap map , namely for @xmath66 , shows gaps for surfaces which have @xmath54 and not @xmath62 .",
    "the maximum bandgap width of 11.9% is reached for @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the corresponding midgap frequency @xmath69 . for this volume fraction",
    "the structure is broken apart and consists of 20 separate units per unit cell .",
    "for the space groups @xmath3 and @xmath4 only the level surface structures with the lowest genus , namely the p and d structures , respectively , have a pbg . for the @xmath5 space group , the g structure with @xmath54 and the c(y@xmath1 ) structure with @xmath62 have a pbg .",
    "the gap of the g structure , however , is much larger than the one of the c(y@xmath1 ) structure and is thus far more interesting .",
    "moreover the largest part of the band gap map of the c(y@xmath1 ) structure is not formed by surfaces which have @xmath62 but which have @xmath54 , the same genus as the gyroid . hence , for the space groups",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the cubic structures with the simplest topology ( lowest genus ) have the largest pbg .",
    "in what follows we investigate whether this is a generic property or not .",
    "we study the band gap maps of the bicontinuous cubic structures in the order of increasing index of their cubic space groups  @xcite ( see table v ) .",
    "two surfaces having the symmetry @xmath70 but having different genus are the @xmath6y and the c(@xmath6y ) surfaces . for the @xmath6y structures with @xmath71 , which exist for @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , no gap is found for the range of parameters analyzed .",
    "however for the c(@xmath6y ) structures we find a band gap .",
    "the variation of the band gap with volume fraction for the c(@xmath6y ) structures with @xmath74 is shown in fig.[fig : levsurf2 ] .",
    "the existence region of the c(@xmath6y ) level surface structures is @xmath75 , corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "a pbg is found for volume fractions between 0.08 and 0.37 ( @xmath77 ) and is largest for a volume fraction of 17% ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the largest band gap ( 8.1% ) is not so large as the one for the d and g surfaces but the midgap frequency @xmath79 is noticeable larger .",
    "this can be advantageous for the production of pbg crystals in the shorter wave length regimes .",
    "also for this space group only the dielectric structure with the lowest genus shows a gap .",
    "the next cubic space group we consider is the @xmath80 group .",
    "the c(s ) surface belongs to this group . for the nodal approximation of the c(s ) surface the morphological image analysis method  @xcite yields @xmath81",
    "this value for the genus is much higher than @xmath82 reported by fisher _",
    "for the minimal c(s ) surface  @xcite . for the c(s ) level surface family",
    "connected level surfaces exist for @xmath83 , corresponding to @xmath33 values between 0.23 and 0.77 .",
    "our calculations show that the c(s ) structure has no pbg , which may be not so surprising due to the high genus and hence complex topology of the structure .",
    "two other level surfaces belonging to a cubic symmetry group based on a simple cubic bravais lattice are the y and c(y ) surfaces with @xmath84 symmetry .",
    "both level surfaces have @xmath74 .",
    "fisher _ et al .",
    "_ found @xmath82 for the y surface  @xcite .",
    "this difference might again be caused by the fact that fisher _ et al .",
    "_ have worked with minimal surfaces , while we use the nodal approximations .",
    "the y level surface structure , which exists for volume fractions between 0.27 and 0.73 ( @xmath85 ) , has no pbg .",
    "for the c(y ) surface , a family of connected level surfaces exists for @xmath86 , corresponding to volume fractions in the range 8 - 92% .",
    "the band gap map for the c(y ) structure is shown in fig.[fig : levsurf2 ] .",
    "the c(y ) structure exhibits a gap for volume fractions ranging from 0.16 to 0.35 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the maximum value @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) is reached for a volume fraction of approximately 22% ( @xmath90 ) , as can be seen from table v. the y and c(y ) level surface structures have the same symmetry , the same genus and the same dielectric contrast but only the c(y ) structures have a pbg .",
    "the y structures , however , only exist for a relatively high fraction of the volume occupied by the high dielectric material , which in general is a disadvantage for the appearance of pbgs .",
    "a single level surface belonging to a cubic space group based on a body - centered cubic bravais lattice is the s surface .",
    "the s surface has @xmath91 symmetry and has genus 21 .",
    "the family of connected s level surfaces exists for @xmath92 , corresponding to @xmath33 values between 0.12 and 0.88 .",
    "our calculations show that the s structure has no pbg for the parameters studied .",
    "the band gap maps of the f - rd and the inverse f - rd structures are depicted in fig.[fig : levsurf3 ] .",
    "the f - rd surface has @xmath93 symmetry and genus 21 .",
    "the cubic space group @xmath93 is a supergroup of the group @xmath3 , the symmetry group of the p surface  @xcite .",
    "the groups differ only by a face - centering translation .",
    "the f - rd surfaces pinch off at @xmath94 and @xmath95 which corresponds to values of @xmath33 of 0.21 and 0.67 .",
    "the results show that the f - rd structure exhibits a gap for volume fractions ranging from 0.25 to 0.43 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the maximum @xmath97 is reached approximately for a volume fraction of 31% ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the midgap frequency @xmath98 .",
    "the f - rd structure has thus a gap of comparable width as the pbg in the p structure , but the midgap frequency is much higher . for the inverse f - rd structure , which exists for @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , we also find a gap with an even higher midgap frequency , namely @xmath101 .",
    "the maximum width of the bandgap is however smaller ( @xmath102 ) than the one of the direct f - rd structure .",
    "in contrast to what is mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , for this example it seems that the increase in symmetry of the dielectric structure does not destroy the pbg property but allows structures with a higher genus to have a pbg .",
    "finally we study three level surfaces belonging to the cubic symmetry group @xmath2 : the i@xmath0-y@xmath1 ( called double gyroid by wohlgemuth _",

    "this structure has two attractive features for the production of a real pbg crystal : a large gap and a high midgap frequency .",
    "this example also shows that increasing the symmetry of the dielectric structure does not necessarily destroy the pbg property but allows structures with a higher genus to have a pbg .",
    "this property was also seen for the direct and inverse f - rd level surface structures . as can be seen from fig.[fig : levsurf4 ] , the inverse c(i@xmath0-y@xmath1 ) structure has a much smaller pbg than the direct c(i@xmath0-y@xmath1 ) structure , namely @xmath111 , and midgap frequency @xmath112 for a volume fraction of 39% ( @xmath113 ) .",

    "the pinching off behavior can be controlled by considering the skeletal graphs of the minimal surfaces using level set methods  @xcite .",
    "this results in less shrinking of the tubes in the middle and less thickening of the tubes at the ends so that more cylindrical tubular structures can be constructed . in table",

    "our calculations show that the direct tubular p structure , which exists for volume fractions @xmath33 between 0.29 and 0.98 ( @xmath118 ) , has a band gap map that is similar to the one of the p level surface structure . as can be seen from fig.[fig : tubesp ] the tubular p structure exhibits a gap for volume fractions @xmath33 in the range 19 - 36% , corresponding to @xmath15 values between -25.00 and -16.50 .",

    "since it has been shown that the square and circular rod structures in the simple cubic lattice have a small pbg for a dielectric contrast of 13  @xcite , our results lead to the conclusion that small changes to the structure ( lower dielectric contrast and slight shape differences ) can make these small gaps disappear .",
    "the direct ( inverse ) tubular g structure pinches off at @xmath125 and @xmath126 , corresponding to volume fractions between 0.03 ( 0.01 ) and 0.99 ( 0.97 ) .",
    "fig.[fig : tubesg ] shows the photonic band gap maps of the direct and inverse tubular g structures .",
    "the band gap maps are similar to the band gap map of the level surface structure ( see also fig.[fig : levsurf1 ] ) . for the direct ( inverse ) tubular g structure the maximum @xmath127 is reached for a volume fraction of @xmath128 , which corresponds to @xmath129 .",

    "this structure is known to have a pbg  @xcite .",
    "this diamond lattice structure leads to the upper left part of the band gap map .",
    "the right lower part of the band gap map comes from the connected tubular structure , which exists for @xmath132 corresponding to @xmath33 values between 0.15 and 0.88 .",
    "the midgap frequencies of the diamond lattice structure are almost twice as large as the midgap frequencies of the connected tubular d structure , which causes the splitting in the bandgap map .",
    "this does not occur in the case of the p level surface structure although also for this dielectric structure the band gap map at the lowest volume fractions @xmath33 is formed by disconnected `` spheres '' on a simple cubic lattice ( see fig.[fig : levsurf1 ] ) .",
    "the direct tubular d structure has a maximal band gap @xmath133 with midgap frequency @xmath134 for a volume fraction of @xmath135 , which corresponds to @xmath136 .",
    "note that the band gap map of the corresponding d level surface structure ( see fig.[fig : levsurf1 ] ) is not split in two .",
    "this is due to the fact that only the connected structures have a pbg for certain volume fractions and that at pinch - off , the d level surface structure does not become a diamond lattice structure .",
    "the inverse tubular d structure has a band gap map that is similar to the band gap map of the corresponding level surface structure , as can be seen from fig.[fig : levsurf1 ] and fig.[fig : tubesd ] .",
    "for the inverse d tubular structure the maximum @xmath137 is reached for a volume fraction of @xmath138 , which corresponds to @xmath139 .",
    "the midgap frequency is 0.569 .",
    "the results are summarized in table vii .",
    "for a fixed dielectric contrast the presence of a photonic band gap is due to a complex interplay of composition ( volume fraction of structure and background ) , the symmetry and topology of the periodic dielectric structure . in general , within one symmetry group , the cubic structures with a simple topology ( low genus ) show a band gap and the complex structures with a high genus do not . increasing the symmetry of the dielectric structure does not necessarily destroy the photonic band gap property but allows structures with a higher genus to have a photonic band gap .    for the production of photonic band gap materials the d , g , and c(i@xmath0-y@xmath1 ) structures are the most interesting ones .",
    "they all have large gaps of approximately 20% .",
    "for the low wavelength regime the c(i@xmath0-y@xmath1 ) structure with @xmath2 symmetry might be most favourable since its midgap frequency ( @xmath110 ) is a factor of 1.5 higher than the one for the ( tubular ) d and g structures .",
    "the tubular d and g structures may be easier to produce than their level surface structure counterparts and have similar band gap widths and midgap frequencies .",
