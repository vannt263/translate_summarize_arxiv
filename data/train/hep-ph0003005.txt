    "these excitations do not decouple in the light cone limit .",
    "genuine nonperturbative techniques must be used to investigate the behavior of this limit . in principle the additional parameter which labels the coordinate system can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "we will show that the zero mode hamiltonian depends on an effective coupling constant containing this parameter and evolves towards an infrared fixed point .",
    "therefore , we propose a sophisticated choice of the frame dependence which facilitates calculations in the near light cone frame .",

    "the values found for the critical indices @xmath132 , @xmath32 and @xmath26 are not far from those of the ising model ( @xmath150 ) ( see table  1 ) .",
    "they are much less accurate but also in agreement with a high statistics analysis @xcite of the @xmath21 deconfinement transition at finite temperature .",
    "we interprete the behavior of the light cone zero mode theory as a consequence of the underlying @xmath151 symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath151 transformations correspond to reflections of the angle variables @xmath152 around @xmath102 .",
    "the hamiltonian and the measure of eq .",
    "( 17 ) are invariant under these transformations .",
    "the resulting critical behavior is common to ising like models .",
    "the critical coupling itself is a nonuniversal quantity and we have found a rough value .",
    "more extended work with the lattice hamiltonian near the light cone is needed to clarify the continuous transition further .",
    "the scaling analysis gives indications that there is a second order transition between a phase with massive excitations at strong coupling and a phase with massless excitations in weak coupling . to reach a higher accuracy large scale simulations of the hamiltonian zero mode system",
    "are needed . in this context",
    "it is advisable to treat the coupled system of three and two dimensional modes together .",
    "a calculation in the epsilon expansion @xcite gives the zero of the @xmath132-function as an infrared stable fixed point .",
    "this shows that the limit of large longitudinal dimensions @xmath4 is well defined . using the running coupling constant @xmath104 of the zero mode system we have ( ) ma = ( g^2_eff - g^*2_eff)^with @xmath153 and @xmath154 from our lattice calculations ( table  [ tabres ] ) .",
    "the mass can be interpreted as an inverse correlation length @xmath155 .",
    "when the correlation length @xmath156 approaches the temporal size of the lattice @xmath157 in the infrared limit we can identify @xmath158 with @xmath159 , where @xmath4 is our infrared length scale .",
    "therefore the effective coupling @xmath160 ( ) runs with @xmath159 in the following way [ gevol ] g^2_eff = g^*2_eff + ( _ 0 g^*2_eff)^1/ ( ) ^1/  . the coupling to the three dimensional modes produces the usual evolution of @xmath161 in @xmath21 qcd , where the coupling @xmath162 at the lattice scale @xmath15 is related to the coupling @xmath163 defined at the infrared scale @xmath164 as follows [ gevola ] g^2(a)=  . combining the eqs .",
    "and we can synchronize the approach to the light cone , _ i.e. _ the limit @xmath165 with the continuum limit @xmath166 .",
    "the condition that the three - dimensional evolution of @xmath161 has to be compatible with the two - dimensional evolution of @xmath104 towards @xmath167 yields that for @xmath168 the light cone parameter @xmath8 approaches zero as ( a ) ~  .",
    "this relation is similar to the naive scaling result deduced in section @xmath169 from physics arguments besides logarithmic modification .",
    "although at the outset we had as parameters @xmath170 and @xmath8 in the hamiltonian we reduce this multiparameter problem to a problem with one single coupling constant which can be chosen as @xmath171 .",
    "we can use the energy and the critical behavior of the euclidean @xmath90 dimensional system to obtain its contribution to the ground state energy of the system in @xmath172 dimensions . in our calculations the energy of the zero mode hamiltonian @xmath173 near the critical coupling is proportional to @xmath174 . using the scaling of @xmath8 determined from the compatibility of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional dynamics , we can eliminate @xmath8 in favor of @xmath175 and get a zero mode energy which grows linearly with the 3-dimensional volume .",
    "that means the zero mode dynamics becomes relevant for the full problem , _",
    "i.e. _ h a ~n_l n^2 _  .",
    "[ meanha ] in reality the zero mode system is coupled to the @xmath172 dimensional system the extension of which is large .",
    "so we expect that the couplings of the @xmath90 dimensional system can get modified . because of the universal dynamics near the infrared fixed point this will not change the qualitative form of the volume dependence obtained in eq . .",
    "the behavior of the zero mode hamiltonian has to be taken into account when we try to solve for the infinite momentum frame solutions of the complete hamiltonian .",
    "the discussion @xcite until now often centers on the order of limits . in order to guarantee a meaningful limit of the near light cone theory ,",
    "one first has to take @xmath176 and then one can take @xmath177 .",
    "this is a workable procedure in solvable @xmath178 dimensional models . in qcd in @xmath172 dimensions",
    "it hardly can serve as a prescription .",
    "numerical solutions have to be obtained with a finite cutoff and the continuum limit can only be reached approximately via scaling relations .",
    "it is in this case that the role of zero mass excitations will crucially enter the physics .",
    "as one sees above the synchronization of the continuum limit with the light cone limit leads to results which are independent of the near light cone parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the independence of the ground state energy near the critical coupling gives us back lorentz invariance which states that the physics should not depend on the reference frame .",
    "the vacuum energy is not allowed to depend on @xmath8 .",
    "there are dynamical zero modes in near light cone qcd which contain the physics of the nonperturbative qcd vacuum , the physics of the gluon and quark condensates .",
    "the nontrivial structure of the nonabelian gauge theory enters in our calculation through the kinetic operator of the rotators which at finite resolution have a finite mass gap vanishing only in the continuum limit .",
    "the near light cone description of qcd based on a modified axial gauge @xmath179 yields a very natural formulation of high energy scattering .",
    "polyakov variables near the light cone have already entered the calculations of high energy cross sections in two different ways : for the geometrical size of cross sections in ref.@xcite the correlations between polyakov lines along the projectile and target directions are important .",
    "for this situation an interpolating gauge may be useful .",
    "for the energy dependence of cross sections an evolution equation of polyakov line correlators approaching the light cone has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite which generalizes the bfkl- equation .",
    "this situation is close to the treatment in this paper .",
    "now the decisive step is to back up our theoretical work on effective transverse qcd dynamics near the light cone with phenomenological consequences for high energy scattering .",
    "a choice of @xmath94 is proposed by comparing monte - carlo weights @xmath180 and @xmath181 which link nearest neighbors in time and space respectively w_t(_1,_2 ) & = & _ 1(x , y,+1 ) e^-h^e _ 2(x , y , )  , + w_s(_1,_2 ) & = & _ 1(x+1,y , ) e^-h^m _ 2(x , y , )  .          the probability distribution for the update of the field @xmath182 is given by the product of weights for all links connecting it to neighbors in time and space .",
    "so the updating procedure for @xmath152 is more effective when @xmath180 and @xmath181 have similar distributions near the angle @xmath183 where the jacobian has its maximum . for @xmath184 ( fig .",
    "[ figwlinks]a ) the spatial weights @xmath181 have a much wider distribution than the timelike weights @xmath180 , whereas for @xmath185 ( fig .",
    "[ figwlinks]c ) the situation is reverse .",
    "for the intermediate case @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ figwlinks]b ) the widths of the distributions are very similar , therefore the updating procedure is optimal .",
