    "a key point is that the non - perturbative numerical data enables us to _ quantitatively verify _ that the perturbative `` scaling '' approach is sufficient to capture many aspects of the mesoscopic fluctuations , as well as to comment on the effect of these fluctuations in the low temperature regime where perturbation - theory is not valid . to get a non - perturbative hold on the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ anderson ] ) , we use a quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) method due to hirsch and fye  @xcite .",
    "because only the @xmath40-site in the anderson model is interacting , the introduction of one auxiliary bosonic variable renders the entire action quadratic in the fermionic fields .",
    "integrating out the fermions leaves a determinant which is a functional of the bosonic variable . finally , using the determinant as the weight to do importance sampling of the bosonic configuration",

    "[ fig : dos](a ) shows @xmath48 for four different realizations of the conduction electron sea .",
    "the first one ( open symbols ) corresponds to the `` bulk - like '' case , by which we mean a discrete spectrum but without mesoscopic fluctuations ( constant spacing of the energy levels , no fluctuations of the wave functions ) .",
    "the perfect agreement with the universal curve demonstrates that , at the temperature we consider , the discreetness of the spectrum per se plays no role .",
    "such effects would appear and could be captured by qmc techniques .",
    "] for the three remaining curves ( filled symbols ) , the one - body matrix describing the conduction electron hamiltonian is drawn from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , which in particular implies independent porter - thomas distributions for the intensities @xmath49 .",
    "implicit here is the assumption that @xmath50 , which , as discussed below , is a well - defined limit in the chaotic case .",
    "an important result arising from these calculations is that not all of the qmc data can be described by the universal form , @xmath51 , with a realization dependent @xmath41 .",
    "this is particularly evident in cases in which @xmath36 turns down at low-@xmath5 since @xmath52 is a monotonically decreasing function .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] , only about half of the realizations yield a temperature dependent susceptibility that can be scaled onto the universal curve with reasonably good accuracy .",
    "_ clearly , mesoscopic fluctuations can cause significant deviations from universality_.",
    "the basic idea of this technique is that hamiltonian @xmath53 with bandwidth @xmath31 can be replaced with another hamiltonian @xmath54 with smaller bandwidth while keeping the low energy physics unchanged . in the bulk case ,",
    "the only coupling parameter is @xmath55 , and its `` renormalization '' causes it to diverge as the bandwidth approaches an energy scale that may be identified with @xmath6 . in our case of a discrete spectrum",
    ", we take out a single level at a time . following anderson , upon removing the topmost level @xmath56 , in order to keep low energy physics unchanged , the amplitude @xmath57 between two low energy states changes by @xmath58 .",
    "interestingly , this equation is solved by @xmath59 of the form @xmath60 with @xmath61 thus in the  poor man s scaling \" approach , the effect of reducing @xmath4 is captured by letting @xmath2 flow , obtaining at low temperature @xmath5 the effective coupling constant @xmath62 where @xmath2 is the `` bare '' coupling constant defined at the cutoff of the kondo model eq .",
    "( [ kondo ] ) . in the bulk problem",
    "it is well known that the `` poor man s scaling '' result can also be reproduced by two other perturbative approaches , namely a one - loop renormalization group analysis , and abrikosov s method for resumming the `` parquet '' diagrams  @xcite .",
    "this is also true in the presence of fluctuations ( see e.g.  @xcite in the perturbative renormalization group context ) . by working at finite temperature ( using matsubara green functions in conjunction with the other perturbative approaches ) @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jeff ] ) is replaced by a more natural smoothed ldos @xmath64 in the following we shall discuss our results in terms of the smoothed ldos eq .",
    "( [ eq : smooth ] ) .",
    "we note that one - loop rg analysis has been shown to be a controlled approximation only for a flat ( bulk ) density of states ; hence , for the mesoscopic regime , we turn to a comparison with the exact numerics .",
    "at a qualitative level , the relevance of @xmath65 can be assessed by comparing panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  [",
    "fig : dos ] , where we have plotted the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the same realizations .",
    "note that the cases with large deviations from the universal behavior are those for which @xmath68 changes the most from the high to low energy scales .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath36 for one realization may be understood as being due to a peak in @xmath68 at low frequencies . in other cases",
    "a dip in @xmath68 causes @xmath36 to increase continuously , perhaps until @xmath69 . in such cases",
    "there is no `` fermi - liquid '' regime ( @xmath70 constant and @xmath71 ) even though the bulk case has such a regime .",
    "as the kondo temperature is defined as the scale at which the effective coupling constant @xmath72 diverges , it is natural to evaluate the realization dependent _ fluctuations _ of @xmath41 around the bulk value @xmath6 using the perturbative kondo temperature @xmath43 defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is averaged over realizations and so is by construction essentially constant .",
    "the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](a ) correspond to the universal curves @xmath75 .",
    "clearly , the high temperature ( i.e. above @xmath43 ) part of the qmc data is well described in this way . to evaluate",
    "how quantitatively eq .  ( [ eq : tkth ] ) describes the data , we furthermore consider _ all _ our realisations that show approximately `` universal '' behavior , in the sense that the data follow the bulk universal curve obtained from nrg rescaled with an appropriate fitted kondo temperature .",
    "this constitutes approximately two - thirds of the realisations studied .",
    "we have then compared ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) this @xmath42 _ fit _ with the energy scale @xmath76 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tkth ] ) .",
    "the agreement is quite good , especially considering that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tkth ] ) is meant to define an energy scale rather than an exact number .",
    "it has to be borne in mind , however , that with the hirsch and fye algorithm we are using , the ratio @xmath77 that can be practically investigated can not be made much larger than 500 .",
    "the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] have been chosen in such a way that temperature significantly smaller than the bulk kondo temperature @xmath6 can be reached , so that the absence of scaling behavior in the low temperature regime could be demonstrated .",
    "this however means that @xmath78 is only a little bit more than a decade larger than the bulk kondo temperature . here",
    "this implies that a good part of the fluctuations seen in the high temperature part of fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] could be explained by fluctuations of the smooth density of states @xmath68 _ at _ @xmath31 .    to show that the one - loop renormalization analysis indeed captures the fluctuations associated with the energy dependence of the density of states",
    ", we have performed another set of qmc simulations , with the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the larger value of @xmath83 already implies that @xmath84 shows significantly less fluctuations .",
    "to completely exclude the possibility that the observed fluctuation of the susceptibility is an effect of variations of the smooth density of states at the scale @xmath31 , we furthermore _ rescale _ all the density of states [ i.e.  multiply the @xmath33 by a constant ] so that @xmath85 for all realizations . the resulting temperature dependent susceptibility , for four realizations ( selected because they display large density of states fluctuations ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : high_t ] .",
    "the comparison with the universal curves @xmath86 shows that in this case , also , the high temperature part of the qmc data is well described in this way .",
    "it is particularly remarkable , in both figs . 1 and 2",
    ", that the rg result works for temperatures as low as @xmath41 or even below .",
    "we thus reach the central result of this paper : _ the excellent agreement seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : high_t ] between theoretical predictions obtained in this way and exact numerical calculations provides a numerical demonstration that this approach is a sound starting point for including mesoscopic fluctuations . _     and @xmath87 , so that @xmath88 , with @xmath89 .",

    "( [ eq : tkth ] ) .",
    "inset : corresponding smoothed densities of states ( with matching line styles).,width=288 ]",
    "this agreement justifies using @xmath76 as the crossover temperature from weak to strong coupling , even for realisations for which the universal scaling is destroyed by the mesoscopic fluctuations . within our rmt modeling , the variance of @xmath91 can be easily evaluated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tkth ] ) in the limit @xmath92 @xmath93 as @xcite @xmath94 for our model , @xmath95 ; more generally it is a number of order 1 .",
    "an improved model can be developed through semiclassical analysis , in which case @xmath96 may signify an energy average .",
    "the correlator @xmath97 is then related to the fourier transform of the classical probability @xmath98 that a particle starts at the impurity with energy @xmath99 and returns there after time @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : tkvar_rmt ] ) can therefore be generalized to @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is the volume of the dot ) . for chaotic systems , @xmath103",
    "so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tkvar_rmt ] ) is then trivially recovered in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath41 vanish , of course , in the opposite limit @xmath105 . a remarkable implication of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tkvar_sc])-([eq : p_cl ] ) is that the value of @xmath1 does not affect the mesoscopic fluctuations for a chaotic system with @xmath106 .",
    "the fluctuations are in this sense `` universal '' , and are described by rmt for any chaotic system .",
    "we have shown that the mesoscopic fluctuations typical in nanostructures significantly affect the physics of a kondo impurity .",
    "our main result is a demonstration that the _ fluctuations _ of the high temperature properties can be understood by following a simple poor man s scaling argument ( or , equivalently , one - loop rg or resummation of parquet diagrams ) and that this works down to @xmath107 .",
    "in addition , we show ( 1 )  deviations from universal behavior at low temperature , ( 2 )  an explicit formula for the variance of the kondo temperature , and ( 3 )  a semiclassical connection between the fluctuations of @xmath41 and the classical probability of return .",
    "kondo physics has recently received renewed attention because of its relevance to the low temperature physics of quantum dots @xcite .",
    "these `` artificial magnetic impurities '' provide tunability of the microscopic hamiltonian , and can be naturally interfaced with larger quantum dots displaying the kind of mesoscopic fluctuations that we address here . from an experimental point of view , the physics we are discussing should be easily observable in such systems .",
    "in particular , we stress that though we have here specifically considered the local susceptibility , the qualitative features we have discussed  the mere existence of the mesoscopic fluctuations , the absence of universality of the low temperature regime , and the universal character , but with a realisation dependent kondo temperature , of the @xmath108 regime  should be observed for other physical quantities . in the same way",
    ", the fact that the the realisation dependent kondo temperature can be extracted from a fit to the universal form in the high temperature regime implies that our quantitative predictions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tkvar_rmt])-([eq : tkvar_sc ] ) can also be tested on physical quantities other than the local susceptibility .    finally , we mention that experimental set - ups where the correlator eq .",
    "( [ chiloc ] ) can be directly measured are also possible . in particular , the problem of charge fluctuations in a gated , coulomb blockaded metal grain @xcite has been shown to be equivalent to a kondo problem  @xcite . in this mapping the charge and gate voltage of the cb problem map to the spin of the kondo impurity and a _ local _ magnetic field applied to it .",
    "the differential capacitance at a degeneracy point in the cb problem is thus equivalent to the _ local _ susceptibility eq .",
    "( [ chiloc ] ) of a kondo problem . in the presence of a strong polarizing magnetic field",
    ", the equivalent kondo problem is described by exactly our hamiltonian eq .",
