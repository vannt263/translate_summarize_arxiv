    "we consider the ionization behavior of a one - dimensional hydrogen atom driven by a strong bichromatic linearly polarized electric field which is modeled by the following one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath0 in atomic units @xmath1 where the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 refer to the low and high frequency modes with frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "these two modes are frequency locked ( and denoted @xmath3:@xmath2 ) , i.e.@xmath2 and @xmath3 are integers . the experimental results on ionization probability obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite for two cases , mode lockings 3:1 and 3:2 , show two very distinct regimes as the phase lag @xmath6 is varied  : for 3:1 , the ionization probability shows a plateau in phase located at a rather high value of ionization probability , and for 3:2 , the ionization probability shows no such plateau but rather a small value of ionization probability .",
    "these results were confirmed by quantum calculations on the one - dimensional model  ( [ hatom ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript is to show that these experimental observations are qualitatively and quantitatively captured using a periodic orbit analysis , which reveals the classical bifurcations responsible for ionization .",
    "our analysis also allows the prediction of ionization at other values of parameters without resorting to large numerical simulations .",
    "a part of the results presented in this manuscript were announced in a fast track communication  @xcite .",

    "these two cases show drastically different ionization behavior which we explain through bifurcations of selected periodic orbits . in these two cases , we described the bifurcations ( if any ) in the system .",
    "we also compute the bifurcation surface which is defined by the set of parameters where a change of linear stability ( associated with a period doubling or halving ) has occurred in the chaotic sea . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we discuss the generalities of residue curve behavior for other mode lockings .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , is composed of a mixture of regular structures surrounded by a chaotic sea .",
    "more precisely , the lower part of phase space ( @xmath9 small ) is composed of rotational invariant tori ( which persist from the integrable case @xmath7 as asserted by kam theorem ) .",
    "the upper part is formed by regular islands surrounded by an unbounded chaotic sea .",
    "the ionizing trajectories are the ones in the chaotic sea which are unbounded ( @xmath9 , or equivalently @xmath8 , becomes progressively large ) . at the center of the regular islands , there are elliptic ( stable ) periodic orbits which organize the regular motion around them .",
    "these periodic orbits partly result from the break - up of resonant tori into a pair of elliptic / hyperbolic orbits ( according to birkhoff s theorem ) .",
    "other periodic orbits result from the bifurcation of these orbits .",
    "the general idea which is applied here is to follow a finite set of periodic orbits ( both elliptic or hyperbolic ) which have been identified as important .",

    "we compute its location @xmath13 and its linear stability property as given by the residue ( which is to be defined below ) .",
    "as the three parameters are varied , we follow the locations and residues of these orbits instead of computing the poincar section for each value of parameters .",
    "this allows us to have a clear idea of what is going on in phase space and to predict ionization thresholds .    in what follows , we perform two kinds of computations  : first , we compute the residue curves which are obtained as functions of the relative phase @xmath6 for fixed values of the amplitudes @xmath31 .",
    "second , we compute bifurcation surfaces which are defined as the set of parameters @xmath28 where a change of linear stability has occurred .    in order to start monitoring the stability of a family of periodic orbits , we first consider a specific periodic orbit , denoted @xmath32 , of hamiltonian  ( [ hatomaa ] ) for @xmath33 which is our reference case .",
    "numerically it is determined using a modified newton - raphson multi - shooting algorithm as described in ref .",

    "the initial condition is @xmath41 ( the two - dimensional identity matrix ) .",
    "the two eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix @xmath42 which make a pair @xmath43 determine the stability properties ( the flow is volume preserving , thus the determinant of @xmath44 is equal to 1 )",

    "we identify the bifurcations ( if any ) of a set of short periodic orbits , i.e. , the type and the value of the parameter @xmath54 where they bifurcate .",
    "this provides a way to foretell if a relatively high ionization rate should be expected or not .",
    "the importance of considering two associated birkhoff periodic orbits ( i.e.  periodic orbits with the same action but different angles in the integrable case , one elliptic and one hyperbolic ) , was emphasized in ref .",
    "the main reason is that it allows one to discard some specific bifurcations ( like collisions or exchanges of stability ) and draw appropriate conclusions concerning the enhancement or reduction of stability .    in the following sections , we analyze the short - time dynamics through residues of selected periodic orbits .",
