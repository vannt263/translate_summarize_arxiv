    "<S> the hybrid paradigm consists in symbiotic involvement of states and methods from discrete ( dv ) and continuous ( cv ) variable domains . </S>",
    "<S> fortes of both can thereby be employed at once ; for example , the continuous part takes advantage of the deterministic state preparation and relatively simple integration with existing information technologies @xcite , while the discrete side benefits from a natural photodetection basis and `` built - in '' entanglement distillation after losses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this flexibility allows hybrid quantum technologies to offer protocols which are superior to both pure cv and dv solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , using hybrid methods in quantum computing @xcite and error correction @xcite is favorable , compared to the mainstream cv and dv protocols , in terms of the number of resources required . </S>",
    "<S> long - distance distribution of cv entanglement requires hybrid processing to mitigate the effect of propagation losses @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> taking advantage of these protocols however requires a procedure for transferring quantum data between continuous and discrete qubit systems @xcite ; hybrid teleportation is therefore identified as one of the three key priorities for quantum teleportation science @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we make a step towards this goal , demonstrating quantum teleportation by means of a hybrid entangled channel . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we develop a technique to teleport a cv qubit , encoded as a superposition of coherent states , onto a dv qubit  a superposition of the vacuum and single - photon fock states . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol is conceptually different from the teleportation of photonic bits by a hybrid technique @xcite , in which both the input and output states are discrete - variable single - rail qubits .    [ </S>",

    "<S> + + + + + + + +    the protocol is carried out via entangled resource state @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 denote , respectively , positive and negative  schrdinger cat \" states @xmath6 @xcite in the cv mode c and @xmath7 is the fock basis for dv mode d , with @xmath8 being the normalization factor . </S>",

    "<S> _ @xcite . limited by the current experimental technology , we work in the regime of moderate amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this facilitates the preparation of the entangled resource , as well as projecting the cv part of the resource and alice s mode onto a bell state ( [ eqbell ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the latter task can in principle be realized by bringing modes @xmath25 and @xmath26 into interference on a symmetric beam splitter followed by a photon number parity measurement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , because a coherent parity measurement is hard to implement in an experiment , we employ an alternative approach , which is feasible at moderate values of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> it consists in replacing a parity measurement by a single - photon measurement in mode @xmath25 after the interference . </S>",
    "<S> a success of that measurement implies that the beam splitter input state has been given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqbell ] ) .    to see this </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that a symmetric beamsplitter transforms bell states into tensor products of a positive or negative schrdinger cat state in one output mode and vacuum in the other @xcite :    [ eqbell2 ] @xmath28    a click of a single - photon detector in mode a can not happen in response to states ( [ eqbell2]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , state @xmath29 transforms into a positive cat , whose fock decomposition for a small @xmath30 contains primarily the vacuum state . the negative cat obtained from @xmath11 , on the other hand , has the single - photon state as the leading term in its fock decomposition and hence is much more likely to bring about a click ( _ supplementary _ ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we tested the above protocol in a simplified manner , with the cv qubit replaced by a coherent state of a varied phase : @xmath31 . in order to predict the effect of our protocol on this state , we expand it in the fock basis up to the single - photon term @xmath32 relating this to eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqcvq ] ) and ( [ eqdvq ] ) , the teleported state becomes @xmath33 in other words , the protocol maps the phase of the input coherent state onto the azimuthal angle of bob s qubit on the bloch sphere . </S>",
    "<S> however , because state @xmath34 falls outside the qubit space spanned by @xmath35 and hence decomposition holds only approximately , the teleportation fidelity will depend on the input phase @xmath36 . for @xmath37 and @xmath38 </S>",
