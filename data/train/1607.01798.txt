    "among other problems , the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics lacks an explanation of what is the dark constituent of our universe , as well as the origin of the tiny neutrino masses . as for the latter ,",
    "the most popular paradigm is to extend the sm with additional fermions , namely right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos , whose role is to generate tiny masses for the active neutrinos , via the so called seesaw mechanism  @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "one of the rh neutrinos can play the role of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the simplest formulation of this is in the type - i seesaw scenario  @xcite , where two of the rh neutrinos are responsible for the active - neutrino masses and mixing , whereas the third one can play the role of warm dm  @xcite .",
    "the majorana masses for the rh neutrinos @xmath1 can , in turn , be generated by the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath2 symmetry  @xcite . in this",
    "so - called _ majoron model _ an additional complex scalar field is added to the theory to break @xmath3 , thus generating majorana masses for the rh neutrinos , also entailing an interesting phenomenology coming from the presence of the scalar and pseudo - scalar couplings to both active and sterile neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "a drawback of the `` vanilla '' seesaw model is that the smallness of the active - neutrino masses requires the yukawa couplings of the rh neutrinos to be very small for rh - neutrino masses at reach of current or near - future experiments , thus rendering the model difficult to test in the foreseeable future .",
    "the required yukawa couplings are of order @xmath4    however , a number of variants of the type - i seesaw mechanism have been developed ( e.g the inverse seesaw  @xcite , linear seesaw  @xcite , etc . ) , where the presence of a leptonic symmetry @xmath3 protects the smallness of the active neutrino masses , thus allowing for much larger yukawa couplings than in , even of order @xmath5 or higher  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these models provide a way to test the seesaw mechanism in the near future , for instance by the observation of lepton - flavour - violation ( lfv ) processes , such as @xmath6 and @xmath0 conversion in nuclei . in particular , the sensitivity of the latter will improve by several orders of magnitude in the near future , thanks to the planned experiments mu2e and comet , as well as to the more distant proposal prism / prime .",
    "typically , in this class of models , in order to generate the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixing , the leptonic symmetry is explicitly broken _ by hand _ in different possible ways , giving rise to the so - called inverse - seesaw or linear - seesaw textures , for instance .",
    "since this class of leptonic symmetries generically gives two quasi - degenerate rh neutrinos , it is tempting to try to explain also the baryon asymmetry of the universe in this model , via the resonant leptogenesis mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by supplementing the leptonic symmetry with a larger @xmath7 symmetry in the rh sector  @xcite .",
    "however , it appears to be difficult to reconcile observable lfv rates and successful leptogenesis in the _ minimal _ models possessing only the leptonic symmetry @xmath3 ( see  @xcite and appendix  a of  @xcite ) .",
    "this is true even if one considers gev - scale leptogenesis mechanisms via rh - neutrino oscillations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or higgs lepton - number violating decays  @xcite . therefore , is it natural to try to address an alternative question : _ is it instead possible , in this class of models , to have observable lfv rates and a successful dm candidate ? _    in this paper",
    "we construct a model achieving this , in which the same leptonic symmetry @xmath3 responsible for ( i ) light - neutrino masses with large yukawa couplings , at the same time ( ii ) stabilizes one of the rh neutrinos , which is therefore a dm candidate .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of @xmath3 involves a _ majoron - like _ complex scalar field , which in turn ( iii ) provides a mechanism to generate successfully the dm candidate in the early universe , together with its kev - scale mass .",
    "the charge assignment under @xmath3 needed to achieve this gives , at the same time , a particular pattern for the breaking of the leptonic symmetry , which in our model is _ not _ performed by hand , but is instead related to the above points .",
    "after this introduction , in section  [ sec : model ] we will construct the model , derive the mass matrix of the neutrinos after the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry and @xmath3 , and describe quantitatively the generation of dm . in section  [ sec : pheno ]",
    "we study the phenomenology of the model , in particular at near - future @xmath0 conversion experiments , as well as in direct searches of the rh neutrinos .",
    "we also study the interactions of the majoron - like field , which can give detectable imprints at the observation of future supernovae . finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ]",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , we aim to build a model in which a global @xmath3 leptonic symmetry allows to have a low - scale seesaw mechanism with large yukawa couplings , and at the same time stabilizes one of the rh neutrinos , identified as a dm candidate .    in the basis in which the rh - neutrino masses are approximately ( in a sense that will be made clearer below ) real and diagonal ,",
    "a low - scale seesaw mechanism with large yukawa couplings is possible if the sm leptons are coupled to the particular combination @xmath8 as a matter of fact , any arbitrary linear combination can be reduced to this , after rephasing @xmath9 in order to have their diagonal mass entries real and positive .",
    "therefore , the sm leptons and @xmath10 need to have the same charge under @xmath3 , which we take equal to 1 , without loss of generality .",
    "if the remaining rh neutrino @xmath11 has an even charge under @xmath3 , it is absolutely stable to all orders in perturbation theory , since its decay must involve an odd number of neutrinos , assuming that no other scalar fields that develop a vacuum - expectation - value ( vev ) have a odd charge under @xmath3 . also , its mixing with the remaining fermion fields is forbidden by construction . for simplicity ,",
    "we fix its charge to 2 .",
    "notice also that its nonzero charge forbids a majorana mass term , thus making it massless in the symmetric limit of the model .",
    "the remaining ingredient is the mechanism responsible for the breaking of @xmath3 , which we take as the simplest possible one : a majoron - like complex scalar field @xmath12 , charged under @xmath3 , that develops a vev . in view of the discussion above",
    ", its charge must be even to ensure the stability of @xmath11 .",
    "as will be shown in the following , the simplest choice @xmath13 gives rise to interesting phenomenology .",
    "thus , the charge assignments of the different fields in our model are summarized in table  [ tab : charges ] .",
    ".[tab : charges ] charge assignment of the different fields under the leptonic symmetry group @xmath3 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the most general yukawa and majorana lagrangians are @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . before any spontaneous symmetry breaking ,",
    "the yukawa matrix has the form @xmath17 as mentioned earlier , such structure of the yukawa matrix protects the neutrino masses to remain zero at all orders  @xcite , while the yukawa couplings can be much larger than in the standard type - i seesaw scenario .",
    "typically , arbitrary perturbations are added to , chosen as to fit the neutrino experimental data . here , instead , the use of a spontaneous breaking of @xmath3 will give a specific pattern for such perturbations in a non trivial manner , due to the particular choice of charge assignment ( table  [ tab : charges ] ) .    in the lagrangian",
    "it will also be present , in general , a higgs - portal coupling @xmath18 .",
    "its effect in the scalar sector is studied in detail in  @xcite . here",
    "we assume that its coupling is small enough to not affect significantly higgs physics .",
    "as about the spontaneous breaking of @xmath3 when @xmath12 acquires a vev @xmath19 , a particularly interesting scenario is obtained when the lagrangian mass term for @xmath12 is smaller than the other scales in the scalar sector : in this case the phase transition breaking @xmath3 coincides with the electroweak phase transition  @xcite , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the temperature in the early universe , @xmath22 is the brout - englert - higgs ( henceforth higgs for brevity ) vev , and the subscript @xmath23 denotes the @xmath21-dependent vevs .",
    "one has yet to point out a rather generic feature of the model .",
    "the lagrangian , with @xmath3 broken by the vev of @xmath12 , is no sufficient for realizing a convenient perturbation term @xmath24 of , in the sense explained above .",
    "namely , a mass term for @xmath11 is not generated , and the global rank of the @xmath25 neutrino mass matrix is 3 giving , in addition to one massless rh neutrino , two massless active neutrinos , which is excluded by neutrino oscillation data  @xcite . in order to circumvent this problem , which is due to the presence of only three `` flavoured '' couplings @xmath26 in the dimension-4 lagrangian , we assume that some uv physics , preserving @xmath3 , generates effective operators suppressed by a uv - physics scale @xmath27 and , as a matter of fact , would not be enough to fit the neutrino oscillation data . ] .",
    "note that no operator triggering a decay of @xmath11 can be written down , due to our charge assignment , as discussed above .",
    "as described above , the most general lagrangian preserving @xmath3 up to dimension-5 operators can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by and @xmath31 without loss of generality we can set @xmath32 , by an appropriate rescaling of @xmath27 .",
    "after the spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath3 symmetry , writing @xmath33 , the majorana mass matrix of rh neutrinos becomes @xmath34 where we have defined @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the dirac mass matrix takes on the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is given by and @xmath39    as pointed out above , one ends up with two almost degenerate rh neutrinos , whereas the lightest one @xmath11 is completely decoupled from the rest of the neutrino sector and constitutes a natural dm candidate , whose mass @xmath40 will be required to be at the @xmath41 scale , as we will see below .      due to its feeble interactions with the other particles , @xmath11 , as a dm candidate , would not be produced thermally in the early universe . therefore , its production has to rely either on the annihilation of some interacting particle  @xcite or through the decay of another particle  @xcite . the dominant production mechanism in our model is provided by the the decay of the scalar component @xmath42 of the complex field @xmath12 , that we will assume to be produced in thermal equilibrium with sm particles after inflation , for instance thanks to its higgs - portal coupling .    the decay process @xmath43 is generated at tree - level once @xmath12 acquires a vev @xmath44 ( see ) , which in the early universe is temperature - dependent . assuming that @xmath3 is broken during the electroweak phase transition ( see the discussion above and  @xcite ) , we take @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the electroweak critical temperature .",
    "analogously , for the vev - dependent mass of @xmath42 we take @xmath47 .",
    "relic abundance produced by the decay mechanism @xmath43.[fig : dm],scaledwidth=35.0% ]    taking into account the decay process @xmath43 , the boltzmann equation describing the evolution of the @xmath11 normalized number density @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the hubble parameter in the early universe , @xmath52 the entropy density , @xmath53 the equilibrium normalized number density and @xmath54 is the thermally - averaged decay rate . in the freeze - in regime the second term in parentheses in can be neglected . the rate @xmath55 is given by @xmath56    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] we plot the @xmath11 relic abundance as a function of the zero - temperature mass @xmath57 .",
    "we see that , for @xmath42 lighter than about @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 by matching this with the observed relic density @xmath60  @xcite we finally obtain the constraint @xmath61 notice that , if the phase transition breaking @xmath3 does not coincide with the electroweak one , but occurs at a higher temperature , this relation will be approximately valid for @xmath57 up to this critical temperature .",
    "in addition to the decay process @xmath62 , one can wonder if the scattering @xmath63 ( in addition to the ones involving @xmath64 ) can give a significant contribution to @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding thermally - averaged rate is @xmath66 , and the contribution of this process to the relic density is found to be @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the initial temperature for the process , i.e. the temperature at which a thermal population of @xmath42 is generated .",
    "the contribution in is much smaller than the observed relic density in the parameter space considered below , unless @xmath68 is larger than @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we will neglect it in the following .    after the spontaneous breaking of @xmath3 , gives the dm mass : @xmath70 combining and we can express @xmath57 and @xmath19 as @xmath71 these relations will be used below to fix the value of @xmath19 in the phenomenological scans and to estimate the lfv rates in the next section .",
    "the light - neutrino mass matrix is given by the seesaw formula : @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 given by and , respectively .",
    "for @xmath75 we adopt the standard parametrization of the pmns matrix  @xcite , and fix the mass differences and mixing angles to their best - fit values  @xcite . because of the leptonic symmetry @xmath3 , only two rh neutrinos effectively participate in the seesaw mechanism , and therefore the mass of the lightest neutrino vanishes in our model . in the following",
    ", we will restrict to the inverted - hierarchy spectrum of active neutrinos , because this gives larger lfv rates involving the @xmath76 and @xmath77 flavours , which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "thus , for a particular choice of the dirac and majorana phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the light - neutrino mass matrix is completely determined , and gives 5 independent ( complex ) relations to fix a number of model parameters . in particular , in addition to the pmns phases @xmath80 , we take as input parameters for the seesaw relation cancel in the seesaw formula at leading order . ] : @xmath81 and @xmath19 , as determined by . then , is used to determine @xmath82 .",

    "the shaded region @xmath84 corresponds to the region excluded the tremaine - gunn bound , the dashed line to the structure - formation bound .",

    "note that the parameter space region where @xmath96 is excluded by the tremaine - gunn bound  @xcite , namely requiring that a fermionic dm population can not reach a higher density than the one established by pauli exclusion principle .    , but with @xmath97 , @xmath83 .",
    "the dashed line is the structure - formation bound , as given by .",
    "[ fig : scan2],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a stronger bound is obtained by structure formation . for non - resonant thermal production of dm , the analysis of lyman-@xmath98 forest data  @xcite give the bound on the mass of the dm , as a thermal relic , of @xmath99 , which translate into a bound on non - resonant thermal production of @xmath100 .",

    "we obtain the bounds @xmath103 notice , however , that these analytic estimates may receive significant corrections in some regions of the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note here that asking for large lfv rates , as just argued above , provides a naturally high value for the scale @xmath27 , say at the scale of the intermediate breaking of grand unfication theories ( guts ) ( @xmath104 ) or even at the gut scale itself .",
    "such intermediate - scale physics , where intermediate subgroups of guts break down to the sm , is argued to cure the metastability of the higgs vacuum in the context of non supersymmetric theories  @xcite and is naturally embedded in so(10 ) guts  @xcite .    , but with @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "[ fig : scan3],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to investigate the lfv phenomenology more quantitatively , we have performed numerical scans of the relevant parameter space , as we are going to describe now . for fixed values of @xmath27 and @xmath107 we have scanned over the parameters @xmath108 , having instead fixed the value of the dirac phase @xmath109 ( as very mildly suggested by the current oscillation data ) .",

    "we also plot the sensitivity of the planned ship experiment at cern  @xcite and the proposed future circular collider fcc - ee  @xcite , in its run at the z - pole mass , and preliminary results for the combined sensitivity at ilc  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : direct ] shows that direct searches will also probe a significant region of the parameter space of the model , where large lfv rates are obtained .",
    "however , the region with @xmath120 appears to be probable , in the foreseeable future , only by lfv experiments .",
    "now that we have investigated possible signatures at lfv processes , we aim to look for potential cross - signals involving the new scalar interactions with the sm leptons .",
    "indeed , the coupling of the complex field @xmath12 to both right- and left - handed neutrinos might have detectable signatures in leptonic bsm physics searches as well as astrophysics observations .",
    "let us first mention that , following  @xcite , loop processes generating decays of the kind @xmath121 have been checked to be small in the region of parameter space considered in this paper and therefore are not relevant for our discussion .",
    "as far as neutrino secret interactions are concerned , there have been a number of studies constraining the emission of majorons by supernova bursts of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a too high production of pseudo scalars out of the supernova core can affect significantly the flux of energy emitted by these objects and hence it gets constrained by the observation of sn1987a .",
    "in addition to the presence of the majoron , a massive scalar is present in the theory and could also be produced copiously by supernova neutrino bursts .",
    "the preliminary analysis in  @xcite provides bounds on such massive - particle emission and prospects on possible future sn detections in the next decades , which are particularly relevant in our model .",
    "we will thus see how our parameter space is constrained by this observable and up to which point observable lfv effects are compatible to possible signals at future supernova observations .",
    "let us rotate the mass matrix of the whole neutrino sector @xmath122 into a block - diagonal form by means of the unitary matrix @xmath123 where we have introduced the matrix @xmath124 .",

    ", the majoron is the pseudo - scalar component @xmath64 , which is massless up to possible quantum - gravity effects , while the scalar component @xmath42 is massive . the couplings to neutrinos read @xmath127 where the matrix @xmath128 and @xmath129 are defined as @xmath130 and @xmath131 the coupling to the electron neutrino ( the most constrained by astrophysical observations ) is the component ( 1,1 ) of the these matrices .",
    "we find @xmath132    .",

    "large lfv rates are compatible with a coupling @xmath133 at @xmath134 , which is close to the current astrophysical limit .",
    "[ fig : majo],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a bound on majoron emission from the sn1987a supernova core explosion has been derived in  @xcite , excluding the region @xmath135 as a matter of fact , such bound is unreachable in the region of parameter space of interest in this paper . indeed",
    ", the order - of - magnitude estimate shows that such coupling is at most of order @xmath136 , when the lfv rates are in the observable range .",
    "nevertheless , the study  @xcite of @xmath137 particle emission from supernovae imposes much stronger constraints on processes @xmath138 from supernova energy loss .",
    "indeed , the typical temperature of the neutrino bath present in the supernova cores ( constituted mainly of electron neutrinos ) is @xmath139 , whereas the chemical potential of the lightest species is @xmath140 .",
    "the potential supernova energy loss by emission of @xmath141 scalars can thus be strongly constrained by the measurement of sn1987a  @xcite leading to the following exclusion bound  @xcite @xmath142 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : majo ] , allowing for a moderate fine - tuning in the seesaw relation , it is possible to have large lfv rates and a coupling @xmath143 close to this bound .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in  @xcite , the bound will be improved considerably by the possible detection of future supernova explosions by icecube , superkamiokande , as well as future dm direct - detection experiments  @xcite . in particular , the possible detection of feebly luminous explosions ( namely , low mass , galactic supernovae at a distance of about @xmath144 ) , together with the very accurate measurement of their neutrino luminosity curves , may improve these bounds by several orders of magnitude , thus giving detectable signals in both lfv experiments and supernova explosions .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the possibility that a leptonic global symmetry @xmath3 protecting the lightness of the active neutrinos in the type - i seesaw scenario , at the same time allowing for sizeable yukawa couplings with the rh sector , is broken spontaneously by adding one `` majoron - like '' complex scalar field to the seesaw lagrangian .",
    "the charge assignment under @xmath3 of such setup allows to render one of the rh neutrino absolutely stable , which therefore constitutes a natural dm candidate .",
    "whereas in this framework it would be difficult to produce the dm candidate via its ( tiny ) interactions with the active sector , the decays of the field responsible for the breaking of @xmath3 allow for a successful production of dm in the early universe , via a freeze - in mechanism .",
    "in the dimension-4 lagrangian only 3 `` flavoured '' couplings are present . in order to obtain a sufficient number of couplings to fit the non - trivial active - neutrino mass matrix , dimension-5 effective operators need to be considered too .",
    "these can arise from some @xmath3 invariant heavy sector at an intermediate scale @xmath27 .",
    "interestingly , the requirement of having large lfv rates , observable in the near future , as well as the observed dm relic density , fixes the various scales of the model :    * the dm mass has to be in @xmath41 range , with possibilities up to the @xmath145 range , in some regions of the parameter space ; * the scale @xmath27 has to be at least @xmath146 , which coincides with the scale of intermediate breaking of various gut models , or with the gut scale itself ; * the scale of @xmath3 breaking is typically in the @xmath147 range . as pointed out in  @xcite , the phase transition breaking @xmath3 can even coincide with the electroweak one .    the model ",
    "in addition to be as minimal as possible  has a set of features which make it testable by future neutrino - physics measurements .",
    "a first point is that the requirement of large lfv rates is more easily satisfied for an inverted - hierarchy mass spectrum , although there are possibilities even for a normal - hierarchy spectrum too . more importantly ,",
    "since only two rh neutrinos have an active role in the seesaw mechanism , the lightest of the active neutrinos is automatically massless .    by construction , the presence of large yukawa couplings allows for lfv processes with large rates , detectable in the near - future at @xmath0 conversion experiments mu2e and comet . as we have explained above , this requirement , which is the original motivation for the model , fixes its mass scales .",
    "in addition to this , since the heavier rh states have masses lighter than 300 gev in a good portion of the parameter space , the model can be tested also by the direct production of these states at future proposed experiments , such as ship , fcc - ee and ilc .",
    "finally , the coupling of the majoron - like scalar field to the active neutrinos can be large in a region of the parameter space with @xmath148 , being in particular close to the recent bound obtained from the neutrino burst of supernovae .",
    "therefore , the model can have addition complementary signatures at future supernova detections by icecube and superkamiokande , which would provide an additional strong piece of evidence for it .",

    "<S> seesaw models with leptonic symmetries allow right - handed ( rh ) neutrino masses at the electroweak scale , or even lower , at the same time having large yukawa couplings with the standard model leptons , thus yielding observable effects at current or near - future lepton - flavour - violation ( lfv ) experiments . </S>",
    "<S> these models have been previously considered also in connection to low - scale leptogenesis , but the combination of observable lfv and successful leptogenesis has appeared to be difficult to achieve unless the leptonic symmetry is embedded into a larger one . in this paper , instead , we follow a different route and consider a possible connection between large lfv rates and dark matter ( dm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present a model in which the same leptonic symmetry responsible for the large yukawa couplings guarantees the stability of the dm candidate , identified as the lightest of the rh neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry , caused by a majoron - like field , also provides a mechanism to produce the observed relic density via the decays of the latter . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological implications of the model are discussed , finding that large lfv rates , observable in the near - future @xmath0 conversion experiments , require the dm mass to be in the kev range . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the active - neutrino coupling to the majoron - like scalar field could be probed in future detections of supernova neutrino bursts . </S>"
