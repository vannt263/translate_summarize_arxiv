    "matter made of free quarks has been discussed in literature for more than 30 years . for further theoretical details and historical developments",
    "we refer to the ` theoretical foundations ' collection of qgp articles  @xcite .",
    "today , many believe that a new state of matter made of free quarks has been formed in relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "is this ` really ' the interacting plasma of qcd quanta , quarks and gluons ( qgp ) , formed and present in a limited domain of space and time , where quarks and gluons are propagating constrained by external ` frozen vacuum ' , which abhors color ? before proceeding to more specific matters , we will make a few general remarks .",
    "we shall discuss in these notes the yields of a diversity of strange hadronic particles produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions , and consider also theoretical models of strangeness production in qgp .",
    "in the analysis of ( strange ) hadron yields we use the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) to connect properties of matter with yields of particles ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "we note that experiments detect reliably just a small fraction of all hadrons of interest . in order to have global and detailed information about the properties of the dense matter source of these hadrons",
    ", an extrapolation must be made to cover production yields of all particles .",
    "the yield of measured particles are obtained from their spectra , which are extrapolated to allow the integration over the full phase space .",
    "this introduces considerable systematic uncertainty , but reduces greatly the dependence on the dynamics of fireball evolution at time of hadronization . in this work",
    ", we address quantitatively only the @xmath0-integrated total , or rapidity density @xmath1 , particle yields , noting sometimes the spectral @xmath0 shape . even in this reduced case ,",
    "considering the complexity of hadronization , and the very rich experimental data set , considerable effort is required to complete the data analysis .",
    "for this reason , we helped develop a hadronization tool share ( statistical hadronization with resonances ) , a suite of numeric analysis programs which is available in the public domain  @xcite .",
    "share is used in all analysis presented here .",
    "share encompasses all other statistical hadronization models ( shm ) , which arise as special cases in share set of parameters .",
    "as the above implies , there are several different approaches one can take in the study of particle yields using shm . in our opinion , shm is a physics - motivated model extrapolating from a subset to all particle yields .",
    "therefore , we take the most elaborate version of the shm model to compare with experiment : the results we present are obtained allowing for the full chemical non - equilibrium in the analysis of hadron yield data .",
    "we present here the key strangeness qgp observables and look at the results with two questions in mind : has the experimental result been predicted to be a qgp consequence ? is an alternative explanation of the data available today , which does not contradict the behavior of the data being explained ?",
    "we will also discuss how understanding of strangeness production at sps and rhic helps to prepare for the lhc energy range , and the low energy rhic run .",
    "we address in turn the @xmath2 ( next section ) , strange ( anti)baryon enhancement at sps and rhic ( section [ abenh ] ) , the k@xmath3-horn ( section [ bmes ] ) . in this context , we expand on the observation of a change in the reaction mechanism , favoring baryons at energies at or above the k@xmath3-peak .",
    "we then introduce the bulk observable , strangeness per entropy @xmath4 in section [ sssec ] , and show how it helps evaluate the ratio of degrees of freedom present .",
    "we then show how @xmath4 can be computed at rhic and lhc and present results showing independence of the result from initial conditions other than entropy content @xmath5 . in section [ strres ] ,",
    "we discuss strange hadron resonances and their importance to the diagnosis of qgp .",
    "we close the discussion , in section [ outlook ] , with a short outlook at the developments in the future .",
    "the first proposed strangeness and hadron yield ratio signature of qgp has been the relative yield of @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite . after cancellation of combinatorial and phase space factors , this ratio is determined by relative quark yields available at hadronization . if no qgp were formed , one could at best hope for chemical equilibrium yields in the hadron gas matter , but especially at relatively low reaction energies this requires a magic touch , the chemical equilibration of strangeness in hadron born reactions .    for both particles considered",
    "we include , aside of directly produced @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the yields of more massive resonances which decay into these particles .",
    "share accounts for this important effect .",
    "however we present first the more intuitive historical line of thought : we assume that the resonance contributions multiply both @xmath6 and @xmath7 by similar enhancement factors .",
    "this being the case , resonance effect can be ignored at first when considering the @xmath2 ratio .    in a baryon - rich qgp environment ,",
    "the light antiquark @xmath8 abundances are suppressed .",
    "this is easily understood as result of @xmath8 annihilation on @xmath9 excess present where baryons are present . in the statistical hadronization model ,",
    "this effect is described by the baryochemical potential @xmath10 .",
    "however , the strange antiquark yield @xmath11 is also suppressed by the strange quark mass . integrating the particle phase space characterized by a production temperature @xmath12 ( hadronization temperature )",
    "we find : @xmath13 the last equality follows for the currently accepted value @xmath14 .",
    "the relative yield originating in the hadron phase comprises , in place of strange quark mass suppression , the hadron phase space suppression factor : @xmath15 in the range @xmath16 mev , the hg yield is significantly smaller compared to the relative yield from qgp .",
    "moreover , in hg the multiplicative factor @xmath17 , will be well below unity at low collision energy .",
    "as a side remark , note that the analysis of the experimental data suggests that this chemical equilibration factor reaches unity for most central and most energetic sps reactions which is evidence for a new production mechanism of all particles .",
    "an important and self - evident result is that , using hadron phase space , it is indeed impossible to ever obtain for @xmath2 a value that exceeds unity .",
    "however , the situation is different when qgp hadronizes .",
    "let us recall the equilibrium hadronization conditions : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the entropy and both @xmath20 and @xmath19 can be understood to be rapidity density .",
    "we abbreviate above q for qgp and h for hg .",
    "moreover , irrespective of question of phase transition , for the purpose of comparison of production yields one normally assumes that chemical potentials are measured and thus yields are compared at a given value obtained from experimental data : @xmath21 in either case much of enhancement of @xmath2 ( and other strange antibrayon relative yield in qgp compared to hg ) is due to the reduced threshold of strangeness in qgp compared to hg .",
    "this argument correctly describes the yields of dominant fractions of ( strange ) particles which carry most of strangeness . for the rarely produced particles which antibaryons are at low energy the situation is more involved . at the onset of global hadronization , @xmath22",
    "this is so since in qgp at first @xmath23 , and strangeness is not clustered in baryon number objects in plasma .",
    "considering that the hg phase is asymmetric at a given baryon number , there is a buildup of @xmath24 with time , reversing with time the asymmetric emission of hadrons .    for conditions we consider , the preferentially emitted particles are carriers of @xmath25-quarks .",
    "@xmath6 ( and @xmath26 kaons ) is emitted at first with preference .",
    "as time progresses this leads to an increase in @xmath27 in plasma phase such that symmetric emission and later @xmath20-quark emission dominance ensues , assuring that strangeness conservation @xmath23 is achieved among all produced particles by the end of hadronization .",
    "however , it has also been speculated that the early asymmetric emission of particles with @xmath28 could lead to the formation of a strangeness enriched residual matter  @xcite .",
    "extensive searches for this effect failed to confirm this reaction model .",
    "what is perhaps instead happening is that at some point @xmath24 is large enough such that emission of particles with @xmath29 dominates .    at the beginning of the process of hadronization ,",
    "the production of @xmath30 ( and @xmath31 ) is enhanced by @xmath32 . once produced",
    ", particles do not disappear , and thus qgp property @xmath32 is imprinted on the enhanced yield of rarely produced strange antibaryons , which are predominantly produced in the early time stage of qgp hadronization .",
    "thus , @xmath33 it is well understood that the value of quark fugacity @xmath34 at hadronization increases with decreasing reaction energy .",
    "this implies that with decreasing reaction energy the relative yield @xmath2 increases , which at first sight is an unexpected result .    beyond this qualitative discussion ,",
    "originally presented more than 25 years ago , a quantitative prediction which includes all resonance decays is shown in fig .",
    "47 of our acta physica polonica review article from 1996  @xcite , which is reproduced at hadronization with figure caption , see . the energy scale @xmath35 ( fireball energy content per baryon ) is somewhat unusual , yet it corresponds almost exactly to @xmath36 , the center of momentum frame nucleon pair reaction energy .",
    "namely , for stopping of energy being 50% of participant stopping , the fireball energy content per baryon @xmath35 , seen in , would be just the cm energy per colliding nucleon pair .",
    "study of energy and participant number content in the fireball matter formed at low energy sps reactions suggest that 50% relative stopping is the right order of magnitude .",
    "the result seen in is not surprising , following on our qualitative discussion , we see how the ratio @xmath37 is increasing with decreasing reaction energy .",
    "it is of some interest to compare this result with the ags and the sps experimental results .",
    "the data analysis has been evolving .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ alap ] , based on compilation of data and theoretical results by the na49 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we see that the central rapidity ratio @xmath2 is well above unity at all available reaction energies . with decreasing reaction energy , this ratio increases , just as it is expected in our above discussion .",
    "the fact that to lowest considered collision energies and smallest reaction systems at ags this trend persists ( within the quite large error bars ) could suggest that qgp formation followed by slow and continuous hadronization is the reaction mechanism governing the production of strange antibaryons at relatively low ags energies .    in the bottom of figure [ alap ] ,",
    "the bulk matter predictions are shown , based on global shm fits to the experimental data carried out by different groups ( including our own results ) , under differing scenarios , all theoretical results have been assembled by the na49 group and we refer to this work for further discussion and references . comparing data with bulk yields",
    "we see that the additional enhancement of @xmath2 we attribute to dynamically evolving @xmath38 is clearly most pronounced at lowest reaction energies .",
    "in fact , for the highest reaction energies , where sudden breakup of the qgp fireball is assured , the discrepancy between bulk hadronization and experimental data could perhaps be accounted for by conventional means .",
    "specifically , the experimental @xmath2 ratio needs to be reduced to correct for the included weak decays @xmath39 which are not included in the shm models . moreover , the thermal rapidity distribution of @xmath6 is narrower than that of @xmath7 , which enhances the central rapidity ratio compared to the @xmath40-yields shown in the theoretical part of the figure . on the other hand ,",
    "the trend of the data at low energies is quite clear , despite the large error bars .",
    "we conclude : @xmath41 ratio , rising with decreasing reaction energy , has been predicted to arise in hadronization of qgp .",
    "no other explanation of this behavior is known to us .",
    "an alternate explanation would have to address both the magnitude of the effect and its energy dependence .",
    "the available data is consistent with qgp ; however , good experimental results are needed to confirm this intriguing trend .",
    "on the other hand , we note that the absolute yields @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are not large . at the top ags energy ( 11.6 @xmath42 gev for central au  au collisions ) , in the most central reactions , one @xmath6 or @xmath7 will be produced in one out of 100 au ",
    "au collisions .",
    "there are important kinetic rescattering processes which can generate a shift @xmath43 inducing suppression , or enhancement of @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "qualitative kinetic model rescattering arguments favor @xmath6 over @xmath7 yield : the annihilation cross section on baryon matter is smaller for @xmath6 .",
    "the strangeness exchange cross reaction is exothermic for @xmath44 .",
    "thus , kinetic rescattering in hg could increase the ratio @xmath2 beyond relative chemical equilibrium yield .",
    "such dynamical effects are not common but must be investigated before we conclude that qgp is formed at top ags energies when good data at ags reaction energy becomes available , @xmath2 is one of the observables meriting very careful experimental and theoretical study .",
    "this is the low reaction energy probe of qgp most resembling @xmath45 suppression : the signal is very clean , but must be carefully considered for competing effects .",
    "cern experiments wa97 and na57 have focused on the study of the systematics of the strange ( anti)baryon enhancement with reaction energy , and centrality in pb - pb collisions . @xmath46 and @xmath47 and antiparticle yields have been measured at central rapidity @xmath48 and medium transverse momentum @xmath49 as functions of the centrality of the collision .",
    "comparing the yields in pb - pb to those in @xmath50be interactions , considerable enhancement of yield per participant is observed .",
    "this enhancement increases linearly with the centrality , and geometrically with the strangeness content in hyperons , reaching a factor of about 20 for the @xmath51 in the central pb - pb collisions .",
    "recently , the final results for the centrality dependence of ( anti)hyperon production in pb - pb , @xmath50pb and @xmath50be collisions at 158 @xmath42 gev / c have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the open symbols , in , show these results , which follow the pattern predicted in the recombination - hadronization model  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement rises , both with the strangeness content in the hadron , and with the participant number @xmath42 ( centrality ) , that is the size of the reaction region .",
    "the magnitude of the the enhancement is nearly the same as seen at much lower sps energy range .",
    "there are further features of the wa97 and na57 experimental results which are particularly important : the enhancement seen at 40 @xmath42 gev / c is very similar , nearly identical , particle by particle , as seen at 158 @xmath42 gev / c  @xcite expert for the most peripheral class of events .",
    "we read this result to mean that the peripheral 40 @xmath42 gev / c reactions do not always reach deconfinement .",
    "the final experimental results differ little from the preliminary conference reports which we discussed at this school in 2003  @xcite and in 1999  @xcite . for this reason",
    ", we focus discussion of this enhancement pattern at rhic , and the comparison of rhic with sps",
    ".    the solid symbols , in , correspond to the most recent star results obtained at @xmath52 gev  @xcite .",
    "the yield of ( multi)strange baryons @xmath53 , @xmath54 and antibaryons per participant @xmath55 in the reaction , divided by a reference yield obtained in @xmath56 reactions is shown . within error , considering also the base yield , the enhancement at rhic and sps appears the same . however , there are two issues to consider : + a ) the enhancement computed by na57 is based on @xmath50be , where some enhancement of @xmath57 is expected to be present , as compared to @xmath56 results . the na49 sps experiment has just reported @xmath57 enhancement evaluated with reference to @xmath56  @xcite . in this more directly comparable case , the sps @xmath57-enhancement comes to be factor 5 - 6 ( rather than 4 - 5 ) in most central pb - pb reactions .",
    "+ b ) the behavior of @xmath6 enhancement at sps breaks the ranks in that it is seen to be nearly flat as function of centrality , and it is smaller at sps than at rhic . + we conclude that the enhancement pattern of @xmath57 and @xmath6 is influenced by the prevailing baryon density , for @xmath6 the enhancement is greater at rhic where the baryon density is smaller than at sps , while the reverse is true for @xmath57 . this baryochemical potential effect is mostly erased considering d @xmath58 , @xmath59 , but is visible within the error bar .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath51 is largest , since production of these particles is very difficult in the elementary reactions , especially so at the lower sps energy .",
    "the interpretation we pursue is that the strange antibaryon enhancement is due to an increased yield density of strange quarks at hadronization , growing within the geometric source size , the increase driven by the longer lifespan .",
    "the gradual increase of the enhancement over the range of @xmath55 is an important indicator of the kinetic strangeness production mechanism .",
    "we return to this in section  [ ssec ] , in the strangeness yield analysis as function of centrality  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement at rhic is in fact fully understood .",
    "we compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental results for @xmath57 and @xmath58 on left and @xmath60 and @xmath59 at rhic in figure  [ rhicenhance ] .",
    "note that the normalization of the enhancement is different  @xcite , as compared to .",
    "this has occurred since the interpretation of the reference @xmath56 data changed .",
    "however , this vertical shift ( in a log - figure ) does not affect the comparison of theory and experiment since both use the same experimental @xmath56 yield normalizer to define the enhancement .",
    "we note that data in figure [ abenhance ] is `` newer '' .",
    "the theoretical lines , in figure [ rhicenhance ] , follow from study of strangeness yield in these reactions based mainly on phenix single strange hadron results  @xcite , and application of statistical hadronization model using these results  @xcite , to predict the yields shown  @xcite . for most peripheral collisions ,",
    "this study is not entirely applicable , since the shm fit to the data is not fully reliable .",
    "this is the ` kink ' in the theoretical curves seen in .",
    "an important help in understanding these results is the gradual growth of the enhancement with centrality .",
    "as we see , the trend is quantitatively consistent with strangeness yield growth ( see section [ ssec ] ) .",
    "both the energy and centrality dependence of the enhancement contradicts the canonical suppression model , which reinterprets this enhancement as being due to reference data suppression  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of ( strange ) ( anti)baryons we just presented is in part due to enhanced production of baryons as compared to mesons when aa reactions are compared to @xmath56 reactions .",
    "the figure  [ ratio ] shows the ratios of @xmath61 and @xmath62 from central au - au collisions at @xmath63 and 200 gev measured by phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite .",
    "we recognize that the formation of mesons and baryons occurs by a different mechanism than in the elementary @xmath56 reactions .",
    "in particular , the large baryon to meson ratio , seen in figure  [ ratio ] , can not be accommodated by the conventional string fragmentation scheme developed for the elementary @xmath64 and @xmath56 reactions .",
    "the quark recombination models  @xcite provided a satisfactory description of the particle yields , in particular , the large production of anti baryons in the intermediate @xmath49 region .    within the statistical hadronization model , when chemical equilibrium is assumed , the relative ratio of baryons to mesons is fixed , and varies along with hadronization temperature @xmath65 .",
    "when chemical nonequilibrium ideas are introduced , the parameter controlling the relative abundance of baryons with respect to mesons is @xmath66 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 are chemical potentials , and @xmath69 is the relative strangeness to light quark phase space occupancy . there is excess baryon - antibaryon pair yield over chemical equilibrium for @xmath70 , expected when the source of particles is a very dense deconfined quark state .",
    "conversely , for low energies or small systems , we expect @xmath71 .",
    "the value @xmath72 can be established when there is time to scatter and equilibrate the yields of mesons and baryons , which in general is not the case in all reactions described here .",
    "consideration of chemical nonequilibrium and the possibility that in some reactions @xmath70 , and in others @xmath71 , provides an opportunity to describe the energy dependence of particle production , studied by the experiment na49  @xcite .",
    "this has as special objective the interpretation of the @xmath73 ratio  @xcite , which shows a pronounced energy dependent structure , see figure  [ kpiratio ] .",
    "the rapid rise in the @xmath74 ratio is due to the more rapid increase in @xmath11 than @xmath75 when the baryon density is very high .",
    "the decrease beyond the peak is driven by a reduction of baryon stopping with increasing reaction energy , at which time there is a faster increase in the @xmath76 yield . in the shm description",
    "the key ingredient needed to obtain this behavior , in consistency with all particle yields , is the switch - over at the peak of the ratio , from @xmath71 to @xmath70 .",
    "the gradual rise of @xmath73 at high energy is associated with an increase of @xmath17 .",
    "the observable @xmath73 has been long considered as a signature of strangeness enhancement  @xcite .",
    "it turned out to also be a signature of anti - quark suppression in high baryon density fireballs created at low reaction energy .",
    "moreover , there appears to be a change in hadronization mechanism associated with the intermediate peak in @xmath73 .",
    "the advancement of this most interesting physics result is mainly due to the diligent work of marek gadzicki  @xcite .",
    "individual particle yields are in general probing conditions prevailing at the time of qgp hadronization . however , bulk fireball properties reach more deeply into the history of qgp evolution .",
    "of particular interest is the ratio strangeness per entropy @xmath4 .",
    "studies of qgp suggest that entropy and to a lesser extent strangeness yields are produced in the earliest stages of the heavy ion reaction . in the next section [ ssec ]",
    ", we will show how ` deep ' strangeness probes . in this section , we look at the qualitative features of this observable .",
    "the deconfined state is rich in both in entropy and strangeness .",
    "the enhancement of entropy @xmath19 arises because the color bonds are broken and gluons can be created .",
    "enhancement of strangeness @xmath20 arises because the mass threshold for strangeness excitation is considerably lower in qgp than in hadron matter .",
    "while entropy @xmath19 determines the hadron multiplicity content , strangeness @xmath20 determines strange hadron content .",
    "thus , to measure @xmath4 , we need to have measured particle yields which comprise much of the total strange and non - strange hadron multiplicity .",
    "in qgp , strangeness @xmath20 originates primarily in gluon based reactions , , @xmath77 , and higher order gluon related processes .",
    "gluons are the source of strangeness ; their presence requires deconfinement , and is a result of entropy production , , excess entropy @xmath19 content .",
    "it is generally believed that the entropy production is completed after first 0.51 fm / c reaction time , at which time the parton matter has turned into the thermalized qgp phase .",
    "strangeness is produced shortly after .",
    "we have been able to unravel much of mystery behind strangeness production ( see section [ ssec ] ) .",
    "however , mechanisms of entropy formation are not understood .",
    "we estimate the expected magnitude of @xmath4 . for thermally equilibrated non - interacting qgp phase at a temperature @xmath78 at which formation of strangeness essentially has ended : = = 0.03 .",
    "here , we used for the number of flavors @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we see that the result is a slowly changing function of @xmath81 ; for large @xmath82 , present at modest sps energies , the value of @xmath4 is reduced by 10% as compared to @xmath83 applicable to lhc and rhic . considering the slow dependence on @xmath84 of @xmath85",
    "there is a minor residual dependence on the value of @xmath78 .",
    "the dependence on the degree of chemical equilibration which dominates is easily obtained by separating the different degrees of freedom : = 0.03 _ s^qgp . given , we expect to see a gradual increase in @xmath4 as the qgp source of particles approaches chemical equilibrium with increasing collision energy and/or increasing volume .",
    "how does this simple prediction compare to experiment ?",
    "a precise measurement of @xmath4 is not easy , since it requires measurement of several particles species to considerable precision .",
    "analysis of existent data was done as a function of centrality  @xcite , and as a function of reaction energy   @xcite .",
    "the centrality study included 11 centrality bins of au - au at @xmath86gev for which @xmath1 for @xmath87 and @xmath7 at @xmath88 have been presented in table viii , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( phenix ) .",
    "these 6 particle yields and their ratios change rapidly as function of centrality .",
    "in addition results from star for @xmath89 @xcite , and @xmath90 @xcite which show minor centrality dependence were used .",
    "supplemental constraints ( ratio @xmath91 , strangeness conservation , electrical charge to net baryon ratio ) help to determine the best fit . the 7 shm parameters ( volume per unit of rapidity @xmath92 , temperature @xmath65 , four chemical parameters @xmath93 and the isospin factor @xmath94 are in this case studied in a systematic fashion as function of impact parameter using 11 yields and/or ratios and/or constraints , containing one ( pion ratio ) redundancy  @xcite .",
    "@xmath95 minimization yielding good significance is easily accomplished , showing good consistency of the data sample .",
    "the resulting statistical parameters are seen in , on left , as function of participant number .",
    "the full non - equilibrium model @xmath96 ( full circles , blue ) and semi - equilibrium @xmath97 ( open circles , red ) are shown . from top",
    "to bottom the ( chemical ) freeze - out temperature @xmath65 , the occupancy factors @xmath66 , @xmath17 and together in the bottom panel the baryon @xmath98 and hyperon @xmath99 chemical potentials .",
    "each of the panels shows very interesting behavior indicating some particular physics feature at chemical freeze - out .",
    "perhaps the overall most striking result is that , for @xmath100 only , @xmath17 varies significantly , as does ( not shown here ) the volume of the reaction domain @xmath101 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath101 with @xmath102  @xcite is expected in a geometric reaction picture .",
    "the growth of @xmath17 indicates that with size of the system there is more effective cooking of strangeness .",
    "there is no saturation of @xmath103 as we approach the most central reactions .",
    "this is inherent in the data we consider which includes the yields of @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "this result is consistent with the implication that strangeness is not fully saturated in the qgp source , though it appears over - saturated when measured in the hadron phase space .",
    "the baryo - chemical potential and hyperon potential ( bottom panel ) is model independent and its nearly constant value indicates that only the reaction energy and not the centrality of the reaction establishes baryon density at hadronization . we find a hadronization temperature which , when we allow for @xmath106 , is at the level of @xmath107 mev , and it rises to @xmath108 when we force light quark chemical equilibrium on the particle yield fit .    on the right , in",
    ", we show the same statistical variables as a function of reaction energy . to study the energy dependence",
    ", we must assemble several different experimental results from different facilities and experiments  @xcite .",
    "the lowest energy result is from our ags study  @xcite ; the sps data we used are from na49 energy dependence exploration at the cern - sps  @xcite .",
    "these results are for the total particle yields .",
    "the two highest energy results are based on studies of rhic data at 130 and 200 gev at central rapidity and address the @xmath1 particle yields , with the highest point corresponding to the results presented at greatest centrality on the left - hand side in .",
    "there are several energy dependent features seen on the right - hand side of .",
    "we note the dotted vertical line at energy where some of the shm parameters undergo a change of behavior .",
    "the value of energy corresponds to where na49 reports a change in the behavior of k@xmath109 .",
    "the statistical parameters obtained in the analysis are used to compute @xmath4 as function of centrality  @xcite , and as function of reaction energy   @xcite .",
    "one indeed finds that corresponding to the growth of @xmath17 seen in , the value of @xmath4 grows , reaching nearly the qgp chemical equilibrium value , @xmath110 at highest rhic energy in most central reactions . as a function of centrality at top rhic energy flat peripheral behavior where @xmath111 at @xmath112 turns into smoothly increasing @xmath4 reaching @xmath110 in most central reactions . as a function of energy near to @xmath113 gev in most central collisions ,",
    "there is a change in growth rate of @xmath4 .",
    "the significance of @xmath4 as an observable of qgp is that it is not dependent on the details of the dynamics of hadronization which remain unresolved today .",
    "the value is predictable , and helps us understand the degree of chemical equilibration of qgp prior to hadronization .",
    "the numeric value for saturated qgp phase is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of strange degrees of freedom to all degrees of freedom in the plasma ( @xmath114 , see next section ) .",
    "thus , @xmath115 indicates that quark ",
    "gluon quanta are active .",
    "the smooth rise and the magnitude of @xmath4 are consistent with the qgp reaction picture  a full interpretation of @xmath4 requires better understanding of qgp chemical equilibration , a topic we address next .",

    "this 20% increase in relative strangeness yield has a highly significant impact on production of strange hadrons .",
    "these results show that the observable @xmath4 is dependent on the dynamics of dense matter evolution ( and also qcd parameters @xmath157 , but not on the internal structure of the qgp , and in particular not on the degree of chemical equilibration ) . at a fixed entropy yield ,",

    "theoretical models of hadron production need to account in their study of particle spectra or / and hadron yields for the contribution originating in resonance decays . in the statistical hadronization",
    ", the production of hadron resonances is abundant . within a particle ` family ' , particle yields with same valance quark content",
    "are in relation to each other well described by integrals of relativistic phase space , eventually corrected for rescattering  @xcite .",
    "the relative yields of , , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , are controlled by the particle masses @xmath161 , statistical weights ( degeneracy ) @xmath162 and the hadronization temperature @xmath65 . in the boltzmann limit ,",
    "one has ( star denotes the resonance ) : @xmath163    in the statistical hadronization model , the assumption made is that the matrix element @xmath164 is not strongly energy dependent ( @xmath165 is energy of particle produced ) .",
    "thus , as shown above , the energy average factorizes .",
    "moreover , one also expects that for most strongly interacting particles , the quantum strength saturates at its maximum , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , in the energy range in which most particles are produced ( but not necessarily in some extreme corners of phase space where special situations prevail ) .",
    "resonance production is measured , in an experiment , directly by the decay product invariant mass method .",
    "presence of these particle , and the fact that their 4-momenta add up to form invariant mass of the parent means that most if not all of the decay products do not significantly rescatter . except for special cases ( @xmath104 , @xmath168 ) resonances contribute 50% and more of the yield of each hadron .",
    "when this is recognized in an analysis of experimental data , one finds that all particles are produced at the same temperature and that the yield temperature ( chemical freeze - out ) and spectral temperature ( thermal freeze - out ) are the same .",
    "this analysis was done for the maximal sps energy  @xcite , and the maximal rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "claims to the contrary rely on analysis which rescatter the resonance decay products such that all particles considered are forced to satisfy a thermal spectrum overlaid with flow from expansion dynamics .",
    "this , then , produces for different particles different freeze - out conditions of temperature and velocity .",
    "such analysis is of course wrong as it presumes tacitly that not a single resonance should be observable by invariant mass method .",
    "putting aside the global analysis of data , we can argue qualitatively for single freeze - out , comparing the baryon and antibaryon @xmath0 spectra as measured very precisely by wa97 and na57 at sps  @xcite , and star at rhic  @xcite .",
    "we note that if hadron gas were to surround at any relevant stage the plasma phase , such a symmetry could not arise in the presence of a baryon excess : the @xmath169 annihilation is strongly momentum dependent , this should deplete the low momentum yield .",
    "this deforms the shape of the antihyperon spectra , as compared to the spectra of hyperons .",
    "more specifically , @xmath170 could annihilate on relatively abundant @xmath171 ( rather than the much smaller @xmath172 ) , and yet the spectral @xmath0-distributions of @xmath170 are within a fraction of percent error , identical to @xmath173 .",
    "absence of spectral deformation suggests that @xmath170 emerge directly and without significant rescattering .",
    "our working hypothesis is therefore that hadronization of the qgp deconfined phase formed in high energy nuclear collisions at top sps energy and rhic energies is direct , fast ( sudden ) and occurs without significant sequel interactions . in this circumstance ,",
    "the measurement of the relative yield of hadron resonances is a sensitive test of the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) hypothesis and lays the foundation to the application of the shm method in data analysis .",
    "one of the great successes of the chemical nonequilibrium particle yield analysis is the agreement with the experimental resonance yields .",
    "these , in particular , are at rhic k@xmath174  @xcite .",
    "our relatively low hadronization ( chemical freeze - out ) temperature makes this possible .",
    "more data is on the way and will keep us busy in coming years  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the systematic study of resonance production can resolve the question about the reaction energy dependence of the freeze - out condition temperature .",
    "one could argue naively that this is simply the temperature at the quark - hadron transformation seen in lattice computations .",
    "this implies a smooth change with reaction energy , since temperature rises smoothly while baryon density decreases .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath65 is reached at highest reaction energy . however , since there is no sharp phase transition at small baryon density prevailing at lhc , rhic and perhaps top sps energy , there is in this hypothesis a lot of uncertainty : the value of cross - over temperature varies depending on observables considered . moreover , among lattice results there is considerable difference in the range of interest for maximum @xmath65 , with @xmath175 mev  @xcite , and @xmath176 mev  @xcite , at zero baryon density . in recent years",
    ", @xmath65 has varied within these limits  @xcite .",
    "our view is that freeze - out temperature is , to a large extent , influenced by the dynamics of the rapidly expanding fireball  @xcite : a ) when the collective flow occurs at parton level , the color charge flow , like a wind , pushes out the vacuum , adding to thermal pressure a dynamical component  @xcite .",
    "this can , in general , lead to supercooling and a sudden breakup of the fireball .",
    "we find that this can reduce the effective hadronization temperature by 20 mev  @xcite .",
    "+ b ) we also must consider the chemical composition of the hadronizing qgp .",
    "it is well known that the critical temperature is dependent on the flavor content .",
    "thus , the degree of chemical equilibration of strange quark flavor influences the exact location of the boundary , and the nature of the transition . because the degree of equilibration in the qgp depends on the collision energy , as does the collective expansion velocity , we can not expect a simple hadronization scheme appropriate for the hadronization of nearly adiabatically expanding universe",
    ". we can be nearly sure that the chemical conditions matter and can displace the transition temperature .",
    "the question of considerable importance is how we can find agreement on what the temperature of hadronization is , and be able to trace in the phase diagram the hadronization boundary , in a way that leads to general agreement .",
    "the disagreement is considerable . in figure [ cleyfig ] , we see the situation proposed for the hadron system considered to be in absolute chemical equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "at highest heavy ion reaction energy , one obtains chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath177 mev .",
    "values as low as @xmath178 mev are reported at lowest reaction energies available .",
    "as the collision energy increases , the freeze - out temperature increases and the baryonic density ( here baryonic chemical potential @xmath179 ) decreases .",
    "such an increase of freeze - out temperature with collision energy is expected on general grounds , since with increasing reaction energy a greater fraction of the energy is carried by mesons created in the collision , rather than pre - existing baryons  @xcite .",
    "there is no sign of any structure , in figure [ cleyfig ] , when the reaction energy varies .",
    "the rather smooth hadronization curve makes it impossible to describe the experimental discontinuity in the ratio k@xmath3 ( see figure [ kpiratio ] ) and other related experimental features  @xcite .",
    "an effort was made to interpret this in terms of a shift from baryon to meson dominance  @xcite of the hadron yields .",
    "however , in the chemical equilibrium model , all observables including k@xmath3 remain a smooth function of reaction energy , in contrast to the experimental results .",
    "the systematic behavior of freeze - out condition in the @xmath65-@xmath179 plane allowing for @xmath106 is quite different  @xcite , see figure [ ph ] .",
    "the two higher @xmath65 values at right are for 20 @xmath42 gev ( lowest cern - sps energy ) and ( furthest to right ) 11.6 @xmath42 gev ( highest bnl - ags energy ) reactions . in these two cases",
    "the source of particles is relatively large , dilute and strongly chemically under - saturated , and hotter than otherwise has been expected .",
    "such a system could be a conventional hadron gas fireball that had not the time to chemically equilibrate .",
    "other options were considered such as a phase of constituent massive quarks .",
    "the higher temperature and lower density imply that at the time of freeze - out the fireball is not expanding as fast as found at higher reaction energies .",
    "thus without doubt sudden hadronization does not apply here .",
    "the transition to the supercooled regime occurs and the phase space changes from chemically under - saturated ( @xmath71 ) to chemically over - saturated ( @xmath70 ) where the two dashed lines meet in figure  [ ph ] . at heavy ion reaction energy below",
    "( , to right in figure   [ ph ] ) of this point , hadrons freeze - out with meson number enhanced with reference to antibaryon yield . above 30 @xmath42 gev the antibaryon to meson yield",
    "is enhanced .",
    "cm    the relative resonance yield is only dependent on the temperature of hadronization .",
    "hence the relative yield of resonances will distinguish the two scenarios presented in figures [ cleyfig ] and [ ph ]  @xcite .",
    "torrieri evaluated the relative yield of resonances along the two hadronization curves as function of reaction energy and have found that the behavior is practically opposite .",
    "relative resonance yields in the equilibrium model rise monotonically with energy of heavy ion reaction .",
    "the nonequilibrium model implies overall a reduction of @xmath65 with increasing heavy ion reaction energy , with a strong dip near to the ` horn ' energy . moreover , and beyond the argument presented in  @xcite , the visible resonance yield could be negligible at lowest sps energies due to rescattering of decay products in absence of sudden hadronization .",
    "rereading many experimental and theoretical works we have had impression that there is more experimental data than theoretical effort in this very rich field . to our despair , much of the data analysis is scope - restricted and does not seek overall consistency .",
    "authors of failed theoretical ideas do not come forward to withdraw .",
    "their ideas live on , and are resurrected . today",

    "hadronization of the fireball of matter formed in heavy ion reactions leads to quite different spectra and yields of hadrons than we expect based on elementary @xmath56 reactions .",
    "this change in reaction mechanism favors , in particular , the production of multi strange baryons and antibaryons .",
    "the enhancement we see is what statistical recombination of quarks predicts , both as function of centrality and energy .",
    "many years ago , when the first ideas how to look for quark - matter were born , it seemed that the energy threshold to deconfinement could be low .",
    "nucleons in nuclei seemed to be just barely retaining their individual identities .",
    "just a little push and squeeze with a few gev beam could perhaps be sufficient to lead to deconfinement  @xcite .",
    "this is where we are today , after a long and dramatic excursion to the very high rhic energies : strange antibaryon enhancement suggests that at least down to 40 @xmath42 gev we have @xmath20-@xmath180-@xmath181-matter .",
    "the simplest of all possible observables , the k@xmath3 ratio shows a threshold between 20 and 30 @xmath42 gev projectile energy .",
