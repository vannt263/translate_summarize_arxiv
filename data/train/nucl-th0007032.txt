    "in the space allotted it is impossible to do justice to more than 40 years of work on hadron structure . rather than attempt this , we take very seriously the appearance of qcd in the title and concentrate on the guidance that recent developments in our understanding of qcd provide for future developments in modelling hadron structure . for reviews of the vast amount of existing information on hadron models we refer to recent conferences on hadron structure .    in order to place hadron models firmly in the context of qcd ,",
    "we begin with a summary of the properties of the non - perturbative vacuum , upon which everything else is built .",
    "we then recall some lessons from heavy quark systems before turning to the more complicated case of light quarks , where chiral symmetry plays a key role .",
    "we finish with a brief outlook concerning the theoretical and experimental possibilities in the next decade .",
    "it is by now firmly established that the ground state of qcd is a highly non - trivial state , including both quark and gluon condensates . for a purely gluonic version of qcd the vacuum energy density , @xmath0 , is : _",
    "vac = - 0 | g^2 | 0 = - 0.5 gev / fm^3 .",
    "[ eq:1 ] in comparison with phenomenological estimates of the energy difference between the perturbative and non - perturbative vacuum states , such as @xmath1 in the mit bag model , this is an order of magnitude larger .",
    "thus either the simple idea of the perturbative vacuum being fully restored inside a hadron is incorrect or the situation is rather more complicated than usually assumed .",
    "the light quark condensates , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in the non - perturbative vacuum are approximately equal and take a value around ( -240 mev)@xmath4 .",
    "a quantitative understanding of these values requires a treatment that in nuclear physics terms would involve at least hartree - fock plus rpa @xcite .",
    "the underlying chiral symmetry of qcd ( for massless @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks ) requires that , if the vacuum is to have a non - trivial quark condensate , there must be massless goldstone bosons with the quantum numbers of the pion .",
    "as we move away from the massless limit , these goldstone bosons have masses which behave as : m_^2 = |m . [ eq:2 ]",
    "( in fact , while this relation is only formally correct near @xmath7 , lattice simulations show that it holds for @xmath8 as large as 1 gev . )    by studying the energy of two static sources of opposite color charge on a lattice , it has been shown that purely gluonic qcd leads to a linearly rising potential at large separations , @xmath9 .",
    "this observation naturally explains the observed regge trajectories and effectively `` confines '' heavy color sources .",
    "supplemented by a short - range , one - gluon exchange potential this naturally yields a potential of the cornell type , which has proven phenomenologically so successful for heavy quark - anti - quark pairs : v_q |q(r ) = c - + r. [ eq:3 ] a linearly rising potential at large separations can be understood in terms of a non - perturbative vacuum which has dia - electric properties . by analogy with the meissner effect in superconductors",
    ", one can think of the qcd vacuum containing a condensate of color magnetic monopoles which shield the lines of color electric force into a tube of constant cross section , no matter how far apart the color sources are located .",
    "such a picture is supported by lattice simulations involving abelian projection , but the final details are not yet settled @xcite . on the other hand , in the real world",
    "this situation is altered dramatically by the presence of light quarks which can break the string once the energy stored becomes too great , through the process @xmath10",
    " e.g. , for charm quarks , @xmath11 . for mesons which are stable under strong interactions , virtual processes like this have a quantitative effect ",
    "e.g. , @xmath12 mev in quenched qcd ( qqcd ) , whereas it is 260 mev in full qcd  but do not change the qualitative picture @xcite .",
    "it has recently proven possible to compare various intermediate stages of lattice calculations , such as the quark and gluon propagators , with the forms commonly used in models . in this way",
    "one can refine the model building process using qcd itself .",
    "of course , intermediate steps such as the quark and gluon propagators are not physical and one must specifically fix the gauge in order to make a meaningful comparison .",
    "the gauge most commonly used is landau gauge and techniques have been developed to fix lattice quantities in this gauge .",
    "figure 1 shows the result for the non - trivial momentum dependence of the gluon propagator ( times @xmath13 ) @xcite , @xmath14 , which should go to a constant at large @xmath13 ( up to perturbative qcd logs ) . from fig .",
    "1 we see that the lattice simulation shows that the gluon propagator is clearly _ non - perturbative _ for @xmath15gev@xmath16 .",
    "even more interesting from the point of view of model building is the fact that the gluon propagator is not enhanced as @xmath17 .",
    "while this agrees with some recent schwinger - dyson studies of qcd @xcite , it is in disagreement with at least a naive interpretation of a great deal of phenomenological work related to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking within the schwinger - dyson formalism @xcite .",
    "clearly this sort of interplay between phenomenological models and qcd itself has just begun and we have a great deal to learn from it .    again with landau",
    "gauge fixing , there have been some preliminary studies of the quark propagator in qcd . for euclidean @xmath18 one can write the quark propagator as : s_e(p ) = .",
    "[ eq:4 ] the lattice simulations , which have so far been carried out with relatively large current quark masses , show a clear enhancement in the infrared @xcite .",
    "for example , for a current quark mass of order 110 mev , the simulations suggest @xmath19 mev , decreasing to around 300 mev in the chiral limit .",
    "this is certainly consistent with the general idea of the constituent quark model and indeed this result provides a firm theoretical foundation for the concept within qcd . of course , it also indicates where the concept breaks down and it is clear that in processes involving significant momentum transfer it will be necessary to go beyond the simple idea of a fixed mass .",
    "the similarity of the mass function , @xmath20 , to that found in schwinger - dyson studies @xcite suggests that the latter may be a promising phenomenological extension of the constituent quark idea .",
    "the non - relativistic quark model , which combines the concept of a massive constituent quark with a linear , pairwise confining interaction and a short distance , spin - dependent hyperfine interaction , has had enormous success in correlating a vast amount of hadronic data .",
    "it provides an excellent basis for understanding the spectrum of mesons and baryons .",
    "most notably , it has also provided a very natural explanation of why some states expected in the naive quark model have _ not _ been seen yet @xcite . while until now this explanation has seemed convincing , it has not been seriously tested experimentally .",
    "this is now in process of change with jefferson lab due to produce a tremendous quantity of new , high duty factor data .    amongst the key issues confronting the simple quark model , we mention relativity , the spin - orbit problem and chiral symmetry .",
    "it is quite clear that the approximation that the constituent @xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath21 quarks are non - relativistic can not be quantitatively reliable . for quarks of mass 300400 mev",
    "confined a volume of radius less than 1 fm , it is clear that @xmath22 is of order one .",
    "the relativistic extension of the naive quark model , developed by capstick , isgur and others @xcite has overcome this problem , with a resultant improvement in various transition form factors .",
    "the spin - orbit problem has been around since the beginnings of the quark model , but has been of considerable interest recently in the light of claims that pseudoscalar meson exchange , rather than gluon exchange , as a source of hyperfine splitting would resolve the problem @xcite . on the other hand , as noted by isgur @xcite , with a lorentz scalar confining potential one will automatically have large spin - orbit forces .",
    "the spin - orbit force arising from the usual one gluon exchange interaction can cancel this in the meson spectrum but not in the baryon spectrum .",
    "thus the spin - orbit problem for the baryon spectrum is still very much with us ",
    "see however ref .",
    "@xcite .    as we have already seen in connection with the structure of the non - perturbative vacuum",
    ", chiral symmetry is expected to play a major role in determining hadron structure for light quarks .",
    "unfortunately the constituent quark model destroys that symmetry rather badly .",
    "we shall turn to a specific discussion of the role of chiral symmetry later , but simply note here that a quantitative discussion of hadronic properties is not possible unless measures are taken to ensure that the theory respects chiral symmetry .      in a more sophisticated treatment of hadron",
    "spectroscopy the simple linear confining potential in eq.(3 ) may be replaced by a flux tube model .",
    "this has the advantage that the confining potential then becomes truly dynamical and in particular can be excited .",
    "excitations of the flux tube can result in a new kind of hadron .",
    "the most interesting cases are those where the quantum numbers of the hadron are _ exotic _ ",
    "e.g. , for mesons where they can not be associated with a @xmath23 system .",
    "the experimental discovery of exotic systems , where the gluons have a genuine structural role , would be a vital step towards a full understanding of qcd .",
    "this explains the excitement over the announcement , from e852 at brookhaven national lab @xcite , of three candidates for hybrid mesons with quantum numbers @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 was seen in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels , the @xmath28 in @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the @xmath31 in @xmath32 .",
    "these masses are somewhat lower than the values usually reported in lattice simulations , although for the moment the latter tend to be based on quenched qcd @xcite . while the interpretation of the bnl data should become clearer over the next few years , the announcement lends even greater urgency to the calls for a future hall d program at jefferson lab .      an even more dramatic prediction of qcd than exotic states",
    "is , of course , the possibility of physical particles containing _ only _ glue  the glueballs .",
    "lattice simulations suggest that the lowest mass state of pure glue would be the @xmath33 with a mass of @xmath34 mev @xcite .",
    "experimental searches fave so far found a number of scalar glueball candidates in the mass region 1300 to 1800 mev .",
    "however , the interpretation of the data is badly effected by the fact that in _ real _ qcd , with light quarks , no physical state will be pure glue  rather the best one can hope for is an unstable state with only a small @xmath23 component for some ( unknown ) dynamical reason .",
    "we note that the channel coupling effects induced by decay channels such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 are also quite controversial from the theoretical point of view .",
    "there is clearly room for a great deal of experimental and theoretical work in this field in the future , with a promise of fame and fortune for the unambiguous identification of a glueball state .",
    "as we have already explained , the vast majority of theoretical papers dealing with light quark systems have been based on the constituent quark model .",
    "this approach has achieved a great deal and , as we have seen in sect .",
    "2 , there is a clear qualitative connection between this model and the properties of qcd revealed through lattice calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the constituent quark model is better suited to dealing with systems of quarks that are genuinely heavy .",
    "here we take the chiral properties of qcd very seriously , in order to explore the unique features of light quark systems .",
    "if one defines a tensor @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the energy - momentum tensor of qcd , one finds classically that @xmath39 is zero .",
    "however , if this were to hold at the quantum level we would find that the nucleon mass would be zero . fortunately the divergence of @xmath40 is no longer zero in quantum field theory because of the trace anomaly and one finds for the nucleon mass : m_n = n    the dominant term on the rhs of eq.([eq : trace ] ) is the gluon trace @xcite .",
    "( the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark mass terms are known to be of order 40 - 50 mev from the sigma commutator and while the @xmath21-quark mass term is less well known its not more than 100 mev or so . )",
    "a full understanding of hadron structure in terms of qcd must involve a reasonable physical interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trace ] ) . for the present it is clear that the nucleon mass arises from non - perturbative gluon interactions and that is certainly reflected there .",
    "there are many famous examples of virial theorems which relate apparently different physical quantities and it is likely that such a theorem connects the effective or constituent quark mass appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) to the gluon field energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trace ] ) .",
    "the qcd sum rules have had considerable success in relating hadron masses to various properties of the non - perturbative vacuum .",
    "the famous ioffe formula for the nucleon mass @xcite : m_n = - |q q , [ eq : ioffe ] yields a surprisingly accurate value provided the borel mass @xmath41 is taken to be about 1 gev .",
    "it also illustrates clearly the role of the quark condensate in generating a chiral symmetry violating property such as mass . on the other hand , the connection to eq .",
    "( [ eq : trace ] ) is totally unclear .",
    "more important , the dependence on @xmath42 is incorrect compared with what is found if higher order condensates are included @xcite .",
    "in addition , the leading non - analytic chiral behaviour of the left and right hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ioffe ] ) are inconsistent .",
    "perhaps the most impressive non - perturbative results for the spectrum of light hadrons has been obtained using quenched lattice qcd . once the lattice scale ( i.e. the lattice spacing , @xmath43 ) is set by fitting one mass ",
    "either that of the @xmath44 or @xmath45 meson  the other ground state meson and baryon masses agree with experiment within about 10% @xcite .",
    "this is a remarkable result , even though one would rather set @xmath43 using the string tension , in which case all the masses would be genuine predictions . on the other hand ,",
    "the success raises as many questions as it resolves .",
    "since the chiral properties of quenched qcd ( qqcd ) are quite different from those of full qcd @xcite , it becomes vital to understand how one can , nevertheless , obtain such spectacular agreement .",
    "unfortunately , it will not be possible to handle realistic light quark masses for sea quarks ( i.e. in quark loops ) for quite a few years yet .",
    "however , it is known that chiral symmetry plays a vital role in hadron structure and we have some clues as to how it might effect lattice calculations .",
    "we have already seen that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd requires the existence of goldstone bosons whose masses vanish in the limit of zero quark mass ( the chiral limit ) . as a corollary to this , there must be contributions to hadron properties from goldstone boson loops .",
    "these loops have the unique property that they give rise to terms in an expansion of most hadronic properties as a function of quark mass which are not analytic . as a simple example , consider the nucleon mass .",
    "the most important chiral corrections to @xmath46 come from the processes @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "( we will come to what it means to say these are the most important shortly . )",

    "nn = - _ 0^dk .",
    "[ eq:3a ] here @xmath52 is a natural high momentum cut - off which is the fourier transform of the source of the pion field ( e.g. in the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) it is @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the bag radius @xcite ) . from the point of view of pcac",
    "it is natural to identify @xmath52 with the axial form - factor of the nucleon , a dipole with mass parameter @xmath55gev .",
    "quite independent of the form chosen for the ultra - violet cut - off , one finds that @xmath48 is a non - analytic function of the quark mass .",

    "it is natural to ask how significant this non - analytic behaviour is in practice .",

    "if one s aim is to extract physical nucleon properties from lattice qcd calculations this is extremely important .",
    "the most sophisticated lattice calculations with dynamical fermions are only just becoming feasible at such low masses and to connect to the physical world one must extrapolate from @xmath60mev to @xmath61mev .",

    "the chiral coefficient @xmath64 is only -0.761 , compared with the value -5.60 required by chiral symmetry .",

    "is just as true on the light - cone as anywhere else .",
    "consider the process @xmath106 in light - cone field theory .",

    "the calculation of the properties of highly excited baryons within lattice qcd is a very difficult challenge .",
    "however , for the lowest negative parity states new techniques have been developed which seem very promising @xcite .",
    "on the experimental side we can expect a tremendous wealth of new data from jefferson lab in the next few years .",
    "this should greatly clarify the situation regarding `` missing states '' and give us a much clearer picture concerning many other resonances .",
    "one of the major theoretical challenges for the near future is the need to deal with the coupling of hadron resonances to various meson - baryon channels ( open and closed ) .",
    "not only do we have a problem that some states expected in the quark model are missing but there may be other states that should not be considered quark states at all . a famous example is the @xmath112 , which almost certainly results from the extremely strong attraction in the @xmath113 s - wave , coupled to @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "another candidate which has attracted a great deal of theoretical attention is the roper .",
    "the most recent study by the jlich group , including the effect of coupled @xmath115 and @xmath116 channels , strongly suggests that the roper is not a quark model state @xcite .",
    "this would certainly resolve a number of problems with its low mass .    while these interpretations of the @xmath112 and the roper seem to be correct",
    ", there is a real danger in an uncontrolled coupled channels approach to such problems .",
    "as illustrated by the classic case of the chew - low model of the @xmath117 , it is always possible to generate a resonance through multiple scattering . on the other hand , we know that in the absence of open channels qcd predicts the existence of hadrons .",
    "it is essential in unravelling the nature of observed resonance states that one must use a consistent model of the internal structure of the hadrons involved in order to calculate the appropriate coupling to relevant meson - baryon channels .",
    "the classic cbm work on the @xmath117 showed that in such an approach it was clear that it is primarily a three - quark state , not the result of strong pion - nucleon rescattering .",
    "the jlich group finds a similar result for the @xmath118  even though its coupling to @xmath119 is very strong .",
    "finally , we note that while the examples quoted have been baryon resonances , exactly the same questions arise for mesons @xcite .",
    "this is a field of study which is just beginning in earnest .",
    "it is clear that there have been some outstanding developments in our understanding of hadron structure in terms of qcd over the last 25 years . yet",
    "the next 10 promise much more .",
    "we can expect data on hadron electroweak form factors of increasing precision over a vastly wider range of kinematic variables .",
    "we can also expect an entirely new range of observables , including for the nucleon : virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) , deeply vcs , spin - dependent compton scattering , transition form factors to ( and between ) new baryon resonances , determinations of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the nucleon anapole moment and semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering data .    on the theoretical side there will be rapid progress in lattice qcd , with improved actions and faster computers making it possible to include dynamical quarks with masses approaching the physical region .",
    "improved interaction between phenomenology and lattice simulations will lead to ever more reliable chiral extrapolations of the physical properties of hadrons .",
    "there will also be serious and consistent studies of the effects of channel coupling , both for regular meson and baryon resonances but also for hybrids and glueballs .",
    "finally , we can expect a great deal more productive feedback between the results of qcd inspired models and lattice simulations .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge the collaboration and helpful discussions with many staff , students and visitors at the cssm who have contributed to my understanding of the problems discussed here , especially c. boros , g. krein , d. leinweber , d. lu , w. melnitchouk , f. steffens , k. tsushima , a. williams and s. wright .",
