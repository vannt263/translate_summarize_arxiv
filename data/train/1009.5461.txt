    "collisionless shocks in space and other astrophysical environments are efficient accelerators of energetic charged - particles .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration ( hereinafter dsa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is the most popular theory for charged - particle acceleration .",
    "it naturally predicts a universal power - law distribution @xmath2 with @xmath3 for strong shocks , where @xmath4 is the phase - space distribution function , close to what observed in cosmic rays in many different regions of space .",
    "the basic conclusions of dsa can be drawn from the parker transport equation @xcite by considering the shock to be a compressive discontinuity in an infinite one - dimensional and time steady system .",
    "dsa is thought to be the mechanism that accelerates anomalous cosmic rays ( acrs ) in the heliospheric termination shock and also galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) with energy up to at least @xmath5 ev in supernova blast waves .",
    "however , recent _ in situ _ observations in the termination shock and the heliosheath by _ voyager _",
    "@xmath6 @xcite found the intensity of acrs is not peaked at the termination shock and the energy spectrum is still unfolding after entering the heliosheath , which strongly indicates the simple planar shock model is inadequate to interpret the acceleration of acrs .",
    "numerical and analytical studies suggest the possible solution can be made by considering the temporary and/or spatial variation @xcite . in particular , @xcite discussed the importance of the magnetic geometry of a blunt shock on particle acceleration .",
    "they argued that the missing acrs at the nose of the heliospheric termination shock is due to particle energization occuring primarily back along the flanks of the shock where magnetic field lines have had a longer connection time and higher injection efficiency .",
    "@xcite presented a more sophisticated simulation which gives results similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also developed a 3-d analytic model for particle acceleration in a blunt shock , including perpendicular diffusion and drift motion due to large - scale shock structure .",
    "large - scale magnetic field line meandering is ubiquitous in the heliosphere and other astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of charged - particles in collisionless shocks has been shown to be strongly affected by magnetic - field turbulence at different scales @xcite .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field variation will have important effects on the shock acceleration since the transport of charged particles is different in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , as shown in early work @xcite .",
    "the blunt shocks and shocks with fluctuating front @xcite which have the similar geometry , are also relevant to this problem . in this study",
    "we consider the effect of the large - scale spatial variation of magnetic field on dsa .",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) can be studied by solving the parker transport equation @xcite , which describes the evolution of the quasi - isotropic distribution function @xmath7 of energetic particles with momentum @xmath8 dependent on the position @xmath9 and time @xmath10 including effects of diffusion , convection , drift , acceleration and source particles :    @xmath11 -    u_{i}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}-v_{d , i}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}+    \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\partial u_{i}}{\\partial x_i } \\left[\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\ln p } \\right ] +    q\\ ] ]    here @xmath12 is the diffusion coefficient tensor , @xmath13 is the convection velocity and @xmath14 is a local source .",
    "the drift velocity is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the velocity of the particle , @xmath17 is the speed of light , and @xmath18 is the electric charge of the particle .",
    "@xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* manuscript to be submitted ) considered analytically a model in which the upstream magnetic field was a plane ( say , @xmath19 ) , with average direction in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "the x - component of the magnetic field was composed of uniform sections ( straight field lines ) alternating in sign , which were periodic in @xmath20 .",
    "they find  hot spots \" and spectral effects which illustrate the effect of an upstream meandering in the magnetic field .    here , we consider a 2-d @xmath21 system with a planar shock at @xmath22 , and a sinusoid magnetic field @xmath23 . for most of the parts in this paper",
    "we discuss the case shown in figure 1 . in this figure ,",
    "the magnetic lines of force are illustrated by blue lines .",
    "the shock is denoted by the red dashed line .",
    "the system is periodic in the @xmath24 direction , with the magnetic field convecting from upstream ( @xmath25 ) to downstream ( @xmath26 ) . in the shock frame , the particles",
    "will be subjected to convection and diffusion due to the flow velocities @xmath27(upstream ) and @xmath28(downstream ) and diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to large scale magnetic field @xmath29and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the gradient and curvature drifts in this case are only in the direction out of the @xmath31 plane and thus irrelevant to this study . because of the steady velocity difference between upstream and downstream , charged particles which travel through the shock layer",
    "will be accelerated .",
    "however , since we consider the large - scale magnetic field variation , transport of energetic particles in the fluctuating magnetic field become important .",
    "the diffusion coefficient in the @xmath31 system can be expressed as :    @xmath32    the normalization units chosen in this study are : the spatial scale @xmath33 au , the upstream velocity @xmath34 km / s , the time scale @xmath35 sec and the diffusion coefficients are in unit of @xmath36 .",
    "the shock compression ratio @xmath37 is taken to be @xmath38 .",
    "the shock layer is considered to be a sharp variation @xmath39 with thickness @xmath40 , which is required to be less than @xmath41 everywhere in the upstream simulation domain , where @xmath42 is the upstream diffusion coefficient normal to the shock surface .",
    "the simulation domain is taken to be @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the parallel diffusion coefficients upstream and downstream are assumed to be the same and taken to be @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "the ratio between parallel diffusion coefficient and perpendicular diffusion coefficient is taken to be @xmath46 , which is consistent with that determined by integrating the trajectories of test particles in magnetic turbulence models @xcite .",
    "the momentum dependence of the diffusion coefficient is taken to be @xmath47 , corresponding to non - relativistic particles in a kolmogorov turbulence spectrum @xcite .",
    "the time step is @xmath48 , which is small enough to resolve the variation of @xmath49 at the finite shock layer .",
    "we use a stochastic integration method , which is described in the appendix , to obtain the numerical solution of the transport equation .",
    "the pseudo - particles are injected at the shock with initial momentum @xmath50 , and will be accelerated if they across the shock .",
    "particles which move past the upstream or downstream boundaries will be removed from the simulation .",
    "the system is periodic in the @xmath51direction , so a pseudo - particle crossing the boundaries in @xmath24 will re - appear at the opposite boundary and continue to be followed .",
    "a particle splitting technique similar to @xcite is used in order to improve the statistics .",
    "although we use very approximate parameters , we note that the results are insensitive to the precise numbers .",
    "consider first the case where the average magnetic field is in the @xmath24-direction and the fluctuating magnetic field is @xmath52 .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the magnetic field is convected through the shock front and is compressed in the @xmath53 direction , thus @xmath54 .",
    "for the sinusoid magnetic field considered in this paper , the local angle between upstream magnetic field and shock normal , @xmath55 , will vary along the shock surface . as a magnetic field line passes through the shock surface , its connection points ( the points where the field lines intersect the surface of the shock ) will be moving apart in the middle of the plane ( @xmath56 ) and approaching each other on the both sides of the system ( @xmath57 ) . since , @xmath58 , the particles tend to remain on the magnetic field lines .",
    "because the acceleration only occurs at the shock front , as the magnetic lines of force convect downstream , the particles will be trapped and accelerated at places where the connection points converge toward each other , leading to further acceleration . for the regions where the field lines separate from each other ,",
    "the particles are swept away from those regions .",
    "figure @xmath59 displays the spatial distribution contours of accelerated particles in three energy ranges : @xmath60 ( top ) , @xmath61 ( middle ) , and @xmath62 ( bottom ) .",
    "the density is represented by the number of particles in simulation and its unit is arbitrary .",
    "it can be seen that  hot spots \" form in the regions that connection points approaching each other at all energy ranges , with lobes extend along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the density of the accelerated particles at the connection - point separating region ( in the middle of the plane ) is clearly much smaller , although there is still a concentration of low - energy accelerated particles there since the acceleration of low - energy particles is rapid and efficient at perpendicular shocks . at higher energy ranges ( middle and bottom ) , the lack of accelerated particles may be interpreted as due to the fact that the acceleration to high energies takes time .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the profiles of the density of accelerated particles for different energy ranges at @xmath63 ( top ) and @xmath64 ( bottom ) . in each panel ,",
    "the black solid lines show the density of low energy particles ( @xmath60 ) , the blue dashed lines show the density of intermediate energy particles ( @xmath61 ) , and red dot dashed lines show the density of particles with high energies ( @xmath62 ) . in connection - point separating regions @xmath63 ( top )",
    ", it can be seen that while the downstream distribution of low energy particles is roughly a constant , the density of particles with higher energies increase as a function of distance downstream from the shock .",
    "these particles are not accelerated at the shock layer in the center of the plane but in the  hot spots \" .",
    "at @xmath65 ( bottom ) , the density of particles of all energies decreases as a function of distance , which indicates the accelerated particles diffusive away from the  hot spots \" . since the high energy particles have larger diffusion coefficients than the particles with low energy , it is easier for them to transport to the middle of the plane .",
    "the profile at @xmath56 is similar to _ voyager _",
    "s observation of anomalous cosmic rays ( acrs ) at the termination shock and the heliosheath @xcite which shows the intensity of the acrs is still increasing and the energy spectrum is unfolding over a large distance after entering the heliosheath .",
    "the same physics has discussed by @xcite , where  hot spot \" of energetic particles is produced by the spatial variation of the injection of the source particles . in our current work ,",
    "the concentration of energetic particles are a consequence of particle accelerated in a shock containing large - scale magnetic variation .",
    "the top panel in figure @xmath66 represents the positions in @xmath24 direction and the times as soon as the particles reached a certain momentum @xmath67 .",
    "we show that particles are accelerated mainly at the connection - point converging region .",
    "there are also particles accelerated at middle of the plane because the particles can gain energy rapidly at perpendicular or highly oblique shock due to the smallness of perpendicular diffusion coefficient @xcite , however , the further acceleration is suppressed by the effect that the charged particles travel away from the connection - point separating region , see also the top panel in figure 5 .",
    "it is clear that since the particles tend to follow the magnetic field lines , when the field line connection points separate from each other as field convects through the shock , the particles travel mainly along magnetic field and away from the middle of the plane .",
    "the characteristic time for a field line convect from upstream to downstream @xmath68 , therefore there is no significant acceleration in the middle of the plane after @xmath69 .",
    "some of the particles can get more acceleration traveling from other region to  hot spots \" .",
    "figure 4 @xmath70 shows the distance particles traveled in @xmath24 direction from its original places @xmath71 versus time when particle get accelerated at a certain energy ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "it shows many particles are accelerated close to their original position , which is related to the acceleration in the  hot spot \"",
    ". nevertheless , there are also a number of particles travel from the connection point separating region to  hot spot \" and get further acceleration , which is represented by the particles that travel a large distance in z direction .",
    "figure 5 shows the same plot as figure 4 , except here the critical momentum is @xmath72 .",
    "it is shown again in figure 5 @xmath73 that most of particles are accelerated to high energy are in the hot spot . however , as opposite to figure 4 @xmath73 , there are very few particles accelerated at the center of plane since energetic particles more transport away from the middle region and the time available is not long enough . for a quick estimate ,",
    "the acceleration time is approximately ,    @xmath74    therefore for most of particles , they do not have sufficient time to be accelerated to high energies at the center .",
    "a number of particles accelerated at the center will travel to the  hot spot \" and get more acceleration , as shown in figure 5 @xmath70 .",
    "clearly , this presents different pictures of particle acceleration by the shock contain 2-d spatial magnetic field variations , indicates the resulting distribution function is spatially dependent . in figure 6",
    "we show the steady state energy spectra obtained in the regions _ top _ : [ @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( black solid line ) , and [ @xmath75 , @xmath77 ( green dashed line ) and _ bottom _ : [ @xmath78 , @xmath76 ( black solid line ) , and [ @xmath78 , @xmath77 ( green dashed line ) .",
    "it is shown that the spatial difference among distribution functions at different locations caused by large - scale magnetic field variation is considerable .",
    "the black lines in both top plot and bottom plot , which correspond to the  hot spots \" , show power - law like distributions except at high energies . at high energies",
    ", the particles will leave the simulation domain before gain enough energy which causes the roll over in distribution function , this roll over is mainly caused by a finite distance to upstream boundary .",
    "for other locations , the 2-d effect we discussed will produce the modification in distribution functions .",
    "the most pronounced effect can be found at the nose of the shock ( green lines ) , in the top panel the distribution of which shows a suppression of acceleration at all the energies .",
    "this insufficient acceleration is most prominent in the range of @xmath79 . at these energies the acceleration time scales are longer than the time for the field line convection swipe the particles away from the connection - point separating region , as we discussed above .",
    "the bottom plot show that deep downstream the spectrum of accelerated particles is similar at high energies since the mobility of these particles .",
    "the previous discussion has established the effect of a spatially varying upstream magnetic field on the acceleration of fast charged particles at a shock which propagating normal to the average upstream magnetic field .",
    "we next consider the case where the shock propagation direction is _ not _ normal to the magnetic field .    clearly ,",
    "if the varying direction of the upstream magnetic field is such that at some places the local angle of the magnetic field relative to the average field direction exceeds the angle of the average magnetic field to the shock plane , we will have situations similar to that discussed in the previous sections .",
    "there will be places where the connection points of the magnetic field to the shock move further apart or closer together .",
    "hence we expect the same physics can be applicable .",
    "an example is given in figure 7 . in this case",
    "the ratio of @xmath80 is taken to be @xmath81 , the averaged shock normal angle @xmath82 .",
    "it can be seen from this plot that the connection points can still move toward each other in some regions .",
    "figure 8 shows the density contours of accelerated particles the same as figure 2 , but for the case of the oblique shock .",
    "we find that in this case the process we discussed in the last section is still persistent , even for a oblique shock and relative smaller @xmath80 .",
    "hot spot \" forms correspond to the converging magnetic connection points and particle acceleration is suppressed in the region where connection points separate from each other .",
    "we may conclude that , for a shock which is oblique , if some magnetic field lines can intersect the shock multiple times , we have  hot spots \" of accelerated particles forms where the connection points converging together .",
    "the acceleration of charged particles in shock waves is one of the most important unsolved problems in space physics and astrophysics .",
    "the charged particle transport in turbulent magnetic field and acceleration in shock region are two inseparable problems . in this paper",
    "we illustrate the effect of a large - scale sinusoidal magnetic field variation .",
    "this simple model allows a detailed examination of the physical effects .",
    "as the magnetic field lines pass through the shock , the connection points between field lines on the shock surface will move accordingly .",
    "we find that the region where connection points approaching each other will trap and preferentially accelerate particles to high energies and form  hot spots \" along the shock surface , somewhat in analogy to the  hot spots \" postulated by @xcite .",
    "the shock acceleration will be suppressed at places where the connection points move apart each other .",
    "some of the particles injected in those regions will transport to the  hot spots \" and get further accelerated .",
    "the resulting distribution function is highly spatial dependent at the energies we studied , which could give a possible explanation to the _ voyager _ observation of anomalous cosmic rays .",
    "although we have discussed a simplified , illustrative model , the resulting spectra and radial distributions show qualitative similarity with the _ in situ",
    "_ _ voyager _ observations .",
    "thus , the intensities do not in general , peak at the the shock and the energy spectra are not power laws .",
    "we show this process is robust even in the case of oblique shocks with relatively small magnetic field variations",
    ". large scale magnetic field variation , which could be due to magnetic structures like magnetic clouds , or the ubiquitous large scale field line random walk , will strongly modify the simple planar shock solution .",
    "this effect could work in a number of situations for large scale shock acceleration including magnetic variations , for example , the solar wind termination shock and supernova blast waves .",
