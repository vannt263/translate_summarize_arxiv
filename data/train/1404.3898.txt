    "thanks to the possibility to tune the interaction strength using feshbach resonances  @xcite , atomic gases offer experimentalists a unique venue to investigate the effects of strong correlations in many - fermion systems .",
    "two - component fermi gases with strong attractive interactions , obtained following the lower branch of the resonance , have been addressed in numerous theoretical and experimental studies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "more recently , attention has also been given to the upper branch , where a metastable atomic gas with repulsive interaction can be realized  @xcite .",
    "an important open issue is whether ferromagnetic behavior can be induced by increasing the repulsion strength .",
    "this phenomenon was first discussed by stoner as a paradigm to explain itinerant ferromagnetism in transition metals  @xcite . while , according to stoner s mean - field theory , at zero temperature a ferromagnetic instability takes place when @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the fermi wave - vector and @xmath4 the @xmath5-wave scattering length ) , more accurate many - body theories predict a considerably weaker critical interaction : @xmath6  @xcite . since",
    ", in the general case , all available computational methods for many interacting fermions , including quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite , must adopt some approximations or unproven assumption , a benchmark against experimental results is of outmost importance .",
    "early experimental evidences consistent with the putative itinerant ferromagnetic state have been reported in ref .",
    "however , subsequent theoretical  @xcite and experimental studies  @xcite have demonstrated that , at strong interactions , molecule formation due to three - body recombinations plays the dominant role and induce local heating , thus preventing the observation of the ferromagnetic instability .",
    "theoretical studies indicate that the reach of ferromagnetism could be favored in several ways , including using narrow feshbach resonances  @xcite , considering low dimensional and confined configurations  @xcite , and by loading shallow optical lattices  @xcite or optical - flux lattices  @xcite .",
    "+ since the ferromagnetic transition corresponds to the equal - mass limit of the phase separation in a mixture of two components with different masses , it has been proposed to use mixtures of different atomic species as an alternative route to address itinerant ferromagnetism .",
    "in fact , it has been proven that for any interaction strength it is always possible to induce phase separation by sufficiently increasing the mass imbalance  @xcite .",
    "tuning the mass ratio might also allow to lower the rate of three - body recombinations  @xcite .",
    "however , the critical interaction strength for phase separation has been determined so far only using mean - field theories  @xcite .",
    "this calls for a more accurate theoretical analysis , which is the subject of this article .",
    "+ mass - imbalanced repulsive fermi - fermi mixtures can be realised in experiments performed with two fermionic atomic species , or with one bosonic and one fermionic species if the density of the fermions exceeds that of the bosons and a feshbach magnetic field is tuned to the regime of strong attraction so that all bosons pair up with fermions forming ( fermionic ) molecules  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that fermi - fermi mixtures with population and mass imbalance have been considered also in the context of hubbard - type lattice models , and a variety of magnetic phases has been found  @xcite .",

    "it represents a zero - range interaction acting in the @xmath5-wave channel , and the term in the square parenthesis is a regularisation operator that removes ultraviolet divergences .",
    "while , for @xmath25 , this pseudopotential also supports a two - body bound state that approximates the shallow feshbach molecule , we are interested in the scattering state which describes the repulsive state in the metastable upper - branch of the resonance .",

    "we generalize the second - order perturbative calculation to the case of different masses . by extending the formalism of refs .",
    "@xcite ( see section 1.5 ) and  @xcite to the mass - imbalanced case , one obtains the following expression for the second - order term : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the sum of the two integrals : @xmath36 the integration domains are the fermi sphere of the majority species @xmath37 , with radius @xmath38 , and the fermi sphere of the minority species @xmath39 , with radius @xmath40 .",
    "equations  ( [ irm1 ] ) and ( [ irm1b ] ) are free of ultraviolet divergences  @xcite and do not depend on details of the inter - atomic interactions other than @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the present theory applies to the repulsive state of the fermi - huang pseudopotential  @xcite , and also to other model potentials with finite range , as long as this range is much smaller than @xmath41 . by solving analytically the angular integration and applying two changes of variables : @xmath42 and @xmath43",

    "[ appendix ] , we report an accurate parametrization of the data based on a simple empirical functional form for a few relevant cases of mass imbalance , namely @xmath47 . in section  [ resultsphasediag ]",
    "we employ this parametrization to determine the canonical zero - temperature phase diagrams in the absence of external potentials . by using the local - density approximation",
    ", one could extend this calculation to harmonically confined configurations .",
    "in the case of the fermi - fermi mixture with equal masses ( which can be mapped to a spin-1/2 fermi gas ) the zero - temperature equation of state has been determined using various quantum many - body techniques , including : second - order perturbation theory  @xcite , perturbative expansions in terms of effective in - medium scattering matrices ( correct up to third order in the interaction parameter )  @xcite , diagrammatic theory within ladder approximation  @xcite , and variational quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",

    "when the strength of the repulsive interaction increases , the fermi - fermi mixture might become unstable against phase separation into two domains with different local densities and population imbalances . in the case of species with equal masses , this phase separation corresponds to a quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state .",
