    "albert einstein , in his 1911 paper _ on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light _",
    ", applied the principle of equivalence to the deflection of light rays by the sun .",
    "this marks the beginning of our modern understanding of gravitational lensing .",
    "after the full prediction from general relativity had been confirmed by eddington s observations of the 1919 solar eclipse , it was only in 1936 that einstein considered , rather pessimistically , the deflection due to stars .",
    "zwicky s ( 1937 ) insight one year later that galaxies were much better candidates was finally corroborated by the discovery of the first doubly - lensed quasar in 1979 by walsh , carswell and weymann .",
    "nowadays , over a 100 multiply imaged gravitational lens systems are known . in many of these",
    ", a background quasar or radio galaxy is lensed into doublets or quadruplets by an early - type galaxy .",
    "provided the density distribution at the centre of the lensing galaxy is weakly singular ( that is , no worse than @xmath0 ) , then gravitational lensing yields an odd number of images , generally three or five .",
    "if the singularity is stronger than this , then there is an even number of images , as the central image is absent @xcite .",
    "most early - type galaxies are believed to harbour supermassive black holes in their centres .",
    "the existence and the magnification of the central image in gravitational lens systems are very sensitive to the mass distribution in the centre and the presence of a black hole .",
    "@xcite has shown that the likely range of the flux of any central image is below the range of current instruments , but within the grasp of forthcoming , high sensitivity vlbi arrays .",
    "thus , it is becoming possible to probe the mass distribution in the central tens of parsecs of the lensing galaxy .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to develop some simple models of lensing by galaxies with black holes . @xcite",
    "already studied a galaxy model akin to the cored isothermal sphere and showed that a central black hole ",
    "provided it is not too massive  can create an additional faint central image .",
    "the present paper is a mainly analytical study of the plummer lens with a central black hole and in the presence of external shear . in  2 , we briefly review the properties of the spherical plummer lens and show that its images obey a magnification invariant .",
    "this model is extended in  3 to include a central point mass to which external shear is added in  4 .",
    "plummer s ( 1911 ) model is the simplest self - consistent solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation with finite total mass .",
    "although the density in early - type galaxies decreases less steeply than @xmath1 at large radii , the plummer model still gives a good description of the inner parts , which control the lensing properties .",
    "for an isotropic stellar system , the distribution function @xmath2 depends on the ( negative ) total particle energy @xmath3 only .",
    "the plummer model is then a polytrope defined by the distribution function @xmath4 for a static system , energy conservation @xmath5 holds and , as a consequence , poisson s equation for a self - consistent , self - gravitating , spherical and isotropic system @xmath6 implies the mass density ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1994 , p. 225 ) @xmath7 and total mass @xmath8 .      the angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens plane @xmath9 , the source plane @xmath10 and from @xmath9 to @xmath10 be denoted by @xmath11,@xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we use the conventional dimensionless coordinates @xmath14 in @xmath9 and @xmath15 in @xmath10 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the relative surface density @xmath16 is now obtained by projecting ( [ plumsph ] ) onto @xmath9 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 such that the origin coincides with the lens centre , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the deflection potential @xmath21 is @xmath22 the lens equation is then @xmath23 the image and caustic properties of the plummer lens are briefly summarized below , for comparison with our results in  3 and  4      the determinant of the jacobian of the plummer lens map is @xmath24 the origins of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are critical and caustic points , respectively . for a point source at the origin @xmath25 , the lens equation implies a circular image , the einstein ring , with radius @xmath26 and infinite magnification .",
    "otherwise , without loss of generality , let the source position be @xmath27 , whence @xmath28 and @xmath29 thus , there are one or three images , depending on the source position @xmath30 , the images lie on a straight line through the lens centre . for @xmath31 ( the identity matrix )",
    ", so there is always one image at large @xmath30 , as expected .",
    "the critical curves can be obtained from ( [ sp5 ] ) with @xmath32 resulting in @xmath33 there are two critical circles in @xmath9 if @xmath34 . applying",
    "the lens equation then shows that the caustic corresponding to @xmath35 is the origin point in @xmath10 , whereas the other caustic is circular , as expected by symmetry .",
    "hence three images can occur by crossing this caustic inwards .",
    "however , if @xmath36 then only a critical and caustic point exist and the number of images is one for all @xmath37 .",
    "witt & mao s ( 1995 ) paper introduced the notion of a lensing invariant .",
    "they considered a binary lens of two point masses .",
    "their main result is that the sum of the signed magnifications of the maximum number of five images is unity , namely @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the absolute magnification of the image , while @xmath40 is the parity .",
    "this result holds good irrespective of the position of the source , provided it remains within the central caustic giving rise to the maximum number of images .",
    "subsequently , @xcite and @xcite found further examples of lens models with invariants .",
    "a general theory of such invariants using single variable complex analysis @xcite was developed .",
    "this approach is used here to investigate the general circularly symmetric lens and , in particular , the plummer model .",
    "the standard complexification is introduced ( e.g. petters , levine & wambsganss 2001 , chap .",
    "let @xmath41 be the complex lens and source planes , respectively , and define the complex coordinates @xmath42 let the complex conjugate be denoted by a bar .",
    "the complex lens equation is rendered @xmath43 where the deflection factor @xmath2 is @xmath44 note that , by definition , @xmath2 is a real - valued function so that @xmath45 .",
    "the conjugate of the lens equation is therefore @xmath46 and so @xmath47 the geometrical meaning of ( [ zbar ] ) is plain : due to circular symmetry , we can without loss of generality orientate the real axes in @xmath48 so that the source position @xmath49 is real and hence , by ( [ zbar ] ) , the image positions as well : lens centre , point source and all images are collinear . also , ( [ zbar ] ) allows us to eliminate @xmath50 from the lens equation ( [ leqc ] ) so that standard , one - dimensional complex analysis may be applied .",
    "it can be recast thus to give the imaging equation @xmath51 defined so that image positions @xmath52 correspond to the roots of @xmath53 as the lens model @xmath2 may have isolated poles in the complex plane , the imaging equation is meromorphic .",
    "the signed flux magnification of the image at @xmath52 is given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath54 where the jacobian @xmath55 and its inverse @xmath56 in complex form can be written as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath57 requiring that @xmath58 , it follows that @xmath59 by standard calculus , we find that the sum of the signed magnifications of the @xmath60 images is @xmath61 by using ( [ leqc ] ) in the denominator and ( [ ieq ] ) in the numerator of ( [ mag2 ] ) , the following simplification is obtained @xmath62 we now seek a complex - valued function with residues of the form ( [ mag3 ] ) . consider the integral of @xmath63 along a contour @xmath64 enclosing all @xmath65 roots @xmath52 .",
    "assuming that the roots of the imaging equations are simple , the integrand @xmath66 has a simple pole at each root of @xmath67 and hence residues @xmath68 by taylor expansion of @xmath67 about @xmath52 , as required .",
    "now from the residue theorem , we find @xmath69 furthermore , two assumptions are made which both restrict the functions @xmath2 .",
    "first , no branch cuts to ensure singlevaluedness of @xmath67 are to occur , such that the complex plane is analytic everywhere outside @xmath64 .",
    "secondly , it is assumed that the deflection angle becomes negligible at large distance from the lens centre .",
    "this amounts to @xmath70 as @xmath71 , hence @xmath72 and therefore @xmath73 as @xmath74 .",
    "then by cauchy s theorem , @xmath64 can be distorted to a circle at infinity @xmath75 @xmath76 this result is a magnification invariant for the maximum number of roots @xmath65 of the imaging equation .",
    "although each image corresponds to a complex root of the imaging equation , there may exist roots which do not correspond to physical images and which are therefore called spurious roots . to understand their impact on ( [ miv ] ) , consider two of their properties .",
    "first , by choosing without loss of generality @xmath49 in the imaging equation ( [ ieq ] ) , it is seen that both @xmath77 and @xmath50 are solutions .",
    "so , all spurious roots occur as complex conjugate pairs . secondly , from ( [ ieq ] ) and ( [ mag3 ] )",
    ", we see that the magnifications of a pair of conjugate spurious roots are also complex conjugate .",
    "this implies that the total contribution from spurious roots to the signed magnification sum is always real .",
    "the plummer lens equation ( [ sp3 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath78 from the definition of the deflection factor @xmath2 , it follows that @xmath79 hence @xmath72 as @xmath74 and @xmath2 involves no roots of @xmath77 and hence no branch cut .",
    "the imaging equation is of third degree in @xmath77 and , since the maximum number of images is three , there are no spurious roots .",
    "thus , the plummer model has a magnification invariant @xmath80 in other words , the sum of the signed magnifications @xmath81 of the images is an invariant of the model .",
    "this result appears not to have been realized before .",
    "the standard plummer lens is now modified by introducing a point mass @xmath82 as a model for a black hole at the centre .",
    "using dimensionless coordinates in @xmath9 as before , its relative surface density is @xmath83 whence the total deflection potential is @xmath84 where @xmath85 . the lens equation follows immediately , @xmath86 using ( [ plumdefl ] ) .",
    "this lens equation shows that the point mass introduces an additional image at @xmath87 as @xmath88 : the minimum number of images is two .",
    "moreover , eq  ( [ pbhleq ] ) is of fourth degree in @xmath89 , so a maximum of four images is expected .",
    "some further insight can be gained analytically . with the substitution @xmath90 where @xmath91",
    ", the jacobian can be constructed from the partial derivatives , @xmath92 the radii of the two critical circles are given by det @xmath93 , which yields : @xmath94 so that @xmath95 and @xmath96 the critical circle ( [ pbhcrit1 ] ) has precisely one solution for all positive @xmath97 . applying the lens equation shows that it maps to a caustic point at the origin of @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath36 , there is hence one critical circle in @xmath9 at @xmath98 and one caustic point in @xmath10 : the number of images is always two for @xmath37 . if @xmath99 , @xmath100 introduces two further critical circles in @xmath9 and two caustics in @xmath10 , in contrast to one for the plummer model .",
    "although ( [ pbhcrit2 ] ) is a third degree polynomial in @xmath101 and could in principle be solved analytically , it is , however , more instructive to display the critical circles and caustics numerically .",
    "figure [ fig : plum1 ] illustrates this case with three critical circles and two caustic circles , giving rise to an annular domain with four images inside and two outside of it .",
    "if the point mass @xmath102 increases while the plummer mass @xmath103 is kept fixed , the former will eventually dominate the latter , for some @xmath104 . in consequence",
    ", two images will occur for all @xmath37 , as is plain from the lens equation for negligible @xmath103 .",
    "the annulus in @xmath10 resulting in four images will hence disappear , as shown in figure [ fig : plum2 ] .",
    "let us take without loss of generality @xmath105 , then ( [ pbhleq ] ) requires for the presence of four images @xmath99 and four intersections of @xmath106 where @xmath107 . at the threshold @xmath108 , the graphs of left - hand side and right - hand side match in first and second derivatives , @xmath109 eliminating @xmath110 , they yield a third degree polynomial in @xmath111 which becomes , after the standard substitution @xmath112 , @xmath113 since its cubic determinant is positive , there is one real solution which can be obtained from cardano s formula , @xmath114 to give , using ( [ deriv ] ) and ( [ cubic ] ) , @xmath115 in physical units , the maximum mass of the point mass for four images relative to the plummer model is @xmath116 now consider this as a model of a galaxy with a supermassive black hole .",
    "since many parameters are free , let us take , as a typical example , the total galaxy mass to be @xmath117 and scale length @xmath118 .",
    "let the lens and source be at redshifts @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively , in an einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath121 .",
    "this is a sufficient approximation to the concordance cosmology for the purpose of estimating parameters here , especially because the source distance at higher redshift almost cancels out . a well - known expression for angular diameter distances , then yields @xmath122 . hence from the definitions ( [ kappa ] )",
    ", we have : @xmath123",
    "so that four images can occur , provided the mass of the central black hole is less than @xmath124 from ( @xmath125 ) . in fact , this result is of the same order of magnitude as the masses inferred from observations : the presently surmised median mass of supermassive black holes is @xmath126 of the bulge mass , and galaxy m87 is thought to have a supermassive black hole of mass @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that by ascertaining a fourth lensed image , a relevant upper bound on the mass of the supermassive black hole can be obtained .",
    "note also that this method is viable at cosmological distances which are inaccessible to precise mass measurements from stellar kinematics .",
    "however , this approach has two main difficulties : first , it requires knowledge of @xmath103 and hence the mass and size of the lens , and secondly , the fourth image may be missed or be misinterpreted .",
    "@xcite have recently considered the lensing properties of a cored and a broken power - law isothermal sphere with central point mass . because of their diverging masses , these models are only valid centrally and hence a black hole mass bound from lensing , as described here , is not discussed . based on their numerical simulation of lensing cross - sections ,",
    "the authors conclude that observations of the fourth image , as characteristic lensing signature of a supermassive black hole , should require the next generation of radio telescopes but nevertheless recommend searching already .      using the same conventions as in  2.3 ,",
    "the lens equation ( [ pbhleq ] ) can be recast thus @xmath128 such that @xmath129 so again @xmath72 as @xmath74 and @xmath2 has no branch cut .",
    "the maximum number of images is four .",
    "likewise , the imaging equation is of fourth degree in @xmath77 so there are no spurious roots .",
    "therefore , the magnification invariant holds for the plummer model with central point mass as well , @xmath130 although the central black hole has yielded a further image , it is still true that the sum of the signed magnifications is unity .",
    "circular symmetry is however normally broken in gravitational lensing .",
    "this may be caused by flattening of the lensing galaxy itself or by the presence of an external gravitational field , for instance , in a galaxy cluster .",
    "for simplicity , let us consider a constant external mass surface density @xmath131 and shear @xmath132 .",
    "let the cartesian coordinate axes be in the principal directions so that the perturbation of the lens equation is in diagonal form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath133 where @xmath134 are the components of the total external shear . the lens equation ( [ pbhleq ] )",
    "is now modified thus @xmath135 for @xmath136 , the imaging equation is a fifth order polynomial in @xmath137 . however , as we will see in the next section , the maximum number of images of a plummer model with black hole and shear is 6 .",
    "hence in general , there are spurious roots to the imaging polynomial and a magnification invariant does not exist .        when @xmath138 , eqns ( [ shear1 ] ) and ( [ shear2 ] ) remain circularly symmetric with three critical circles , two caustic circles and a critical and caustic point , as in  3 .",
    "consider now the case @xmath139 , that is , the external mass surface density @xmath140 .",
    "since , by construction , the coordinate axes point in the principal directions of the external shear , the critical curves in @xmath9 intersect the @xmath141-axis with a tangent vector parallel to @xmath142 and the @xmath143-axis with @xmath144 .",
    "the corresponding caustic tangent vanishes if , in addition , @xmath145 or @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "then , these are _ cusp points _ on the @xmath147-axes in @xmath10 ( e.g. @xcite , p. 252 ) .",
    "they may be categorised thus :    * cusp points on @xmath30-axis : @xmath148 @xmath149 there is precisely one solution for @xmath150 , hence precisely two for @xmath141 and two for @xmath30 since @xmath136 .",
    "* cusp points on @xmath151-axis : @xmath152 @xmath153 again , there is precisely one solution for @xmath154 , hence precisely two for @xmath143 and two for @xmath151 since @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , @xmath136 lifts the degeneracy of the caustic point at @xmath155 which was found the previous circularly symmetric cases .",
    "there is now one pair of cusp points on each of the @xmath147-axes giving rise to an _ astroid _ caustic . by crossing the astroid inwards",
    ", the number of images increases from two to four .",
    "if the point source is at @xmath155 , an additional fifth image at the centre of @xmath9 is produced , since by ( [ shear1 ] ) and ( [ shear2 ] ) @xmath156 is a solution .",
    "note that , in this case , circular symmetry is broken and an einstein ring image can not form .",
    "the astroid increases in size as @xmath157 become more different , eventually intersecting the already existing caustic curves .",
    "caustic domains are thereby created in which the image multiplicity increases from a maximum of four to six .",
    "such a configuration of critical and caustic curves is illustrated in the upper and middle panel of figure [ fig : plum3 ] .      as the difference in the shear components increases yet further , @xmath158 and the external mass surface density @xmath159 .",
    "now critical curves and caustics rejoin , as can be seen in the lower panel of figure [ fig : plum3 ] : as the inner two critical curves in @xmath9 merge on the @xmath143-axis , the tangent vector vanishes and @xmath160 .",
    "this corresponds to the rejoining of the inner two caustics on the @xmath151-axis to give two cusps , and is an example of a beak - to - beak metamorphosis . +",
    "our model can also serve to illustrate the metamorphosis of an umbilic . referring to the deflection potential @xmath21 in equation ( [ potential ] ) and the lens equation with external shear ( [ shear1 ] ) , ( [ shear2 ] ) , the conventional form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the jacobian @xmath55 of the lens mapping is , @xmath161 where @xmath162 the umbilic point occurs where both eigenvalues @xmath163 of @xmath55 vanish , @xmath164 these two conditions can now be applied to derive the location of umbilic metamorphoses . since , by construction ,",
    "the coordinate system in the lens plane is aligned with the principal directions of external shear , we can set @xmath165 and @xmath28 . then keeping @xmath166 fixed defines a one - parameter family of lens models in @xmath167 . letting @xmath107",
    ", we hence obtain the value of @xmath167 for the metamorphosis from @xmath168 figure [ fig : umbilic ] illustrates the caustics for a particular plummer model with central point mass and external shear undergoing metamorphosis at an umbilic point .",
    "this paper provides an analytic study of the lensing properties of the plummer model , together with modifications incorporating the effects of a central point mass and external shear .",
    "this is a simple model for lensing by a flattened galaxy with a central black hole .",
    "the maximum number of images given by the circular plummer lens is 3",
    ". this number rises to 4 if a central point mass is introduced and to 6 if external shear is added as well .",
    "there are three new results of our work .",
    "first , a magnification invariant is found to exist for both the plummer lens alone , and for the plummer lens with black hole .",
    "even though the introduction of a black hole changes the maximum number of images from 3 to 4 , it is nonetheless true that the sum of the signed magnifications remains unity .",
    "the second result is a treatment of the caustic structure for the plummer lens with black hole and shear . without shear , there are two caustic circles and a caustic point .",
    "this gives three disjoint regions in the source plane where double , quadruple and double imaging respectively occur .",
    "the introduction of shear causes the caustic point to unfold as an astroid caustic .",
    "the presence of four cusps on an astroid caustic is established , demonstrating the change of image multiplicities as the caustics intersect and metamorphoses occur . for modest shear ,",
    "the astroid is contained within the two outer caustics .",
    "however , as the components of shear @xmath169 and @xmath167 become more different , the size of the astroid increases and additional caustic domains are created in which the image multiplicity is 6 .",
    "based on this discussion of caustic curves , we describe a possible method to obtain an upper limit on the mass of a black hole from gravitational lensing .",
    "as this approach relies on counting images alone , it could be used at cosmological distance and therefore as an independent check on mass estimates obtained from other methods , such as stellar kinematics and reverberation mapping .",
    "this emphasises the value of lensing surveys for constraining the mass distribution in the inner parts of galaxies .",
