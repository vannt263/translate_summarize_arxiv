    "one of the most challenging issues of modern cosmology is to describe the positive late time acceleration  @xcite through a single self - consistent theoretical scheme .",
    "indeed , the physical origin of the measured cosmic speed up is not well accounted on theoretical grounds , without invoking the existence of an additional fluid which drives the universe dynamics , eventually dominating over the other species .",
    "any viable fluid differs from standard matter by manifesting negative equation of state parameters , capable of counterbalancing the gravitational attraction at late times  @xcite .",
    "thus , since no common matter is expected to behave anti - gravitationally , one refers to such a fluid as dark energy .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy consists in introducing within einstein equations a vacuum energy cosmological constant term , namely @xmath0  @xcite . the corresponding paradigm , dubbed the @xmath0cdm model , has been probed to be consistent with almost all experimental constraints  @xcite , becoming the standard paradigm in cosmology .",
    "one of the main advantages of @xmath0cdm is the remarkably small number of cosmological parameters that it introduces , which suggests that any modifications of einstein s gravity reduce to @xmath0cdm at small redshift  @xcite .",
    "however , recent measurements of the hubble expansion rate at redshift @xmath1  @xcite and an analysis of linear redshift space distortions  @xcite reside outside the @xmath0cdm expectations at @xmath2 and @xmath3 confidence level , respectively . due to these facts and to the need of accounting for the ultraviolet modifications of einstein s gravity , extensions of general relativity have been proposed so far .",
    "moreover , the standard cosmological model is plagued by two profound shortcomings .",
    "first , according to observations , it is not clear why matter and @xmath0 magnitudes appear to be extremely close to each other , indicating an unexpected coincidence problem  @xcite .",
    "second , cosmological bounds on @xmath0 indicate a value which differs from quantum field calculations by a factor of 123 orders of magnitude , leading to a severe fine - tuning problem  @xcite .",
    "standard cosmology deems that the universe dynamics can be framed assuming that dark energy evolves as a perfect fluid , with a varying equation of state , i.e. @xmath4 , with total pressure @xmath5 and density @xmath6 .",
    "so , in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) picture , the universe dynamics is depicted through a pressureless matter term , a barotropic evolving dark energy density and a vanishing scalar curvature , i.e. @xmath7  @xcite . in lieu of developing a theory which predicts the dark energy fluid",
    ", cosmologists often try to reconstruct the universe expansion history , by parameterizing the equation of state of dark energy  @xcite . for example ,",
    "polynomial fits , data depending reconstructions and cosmographic representations  @xcite are consolidated manners to reconstruct @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "all cosmological recontructions are based on inferring the properties of dark energy without imposing _ a priori _ a form for the equation of state .",
    "in fact , any imposition would cause misleading results  @xcite , as a consequence of the strong degeneracy between cosmological models .",
    "therefore , it turns out that a reconstruction of @xmath8 should be carried out as much as possible in a model independent manner  @xcite . to this regard ,",
    "a well established method is to develop a model independent parametrization by expanding @xmath8 into a truncated taylor series and fixing the corresponding free parameters through current data  @xcite .",
    "however , even though taylor series are widely used to approximate known functions with polynomials around some point , they provide bad convergence results over a large interval , since @xmath8 is expanded around @xmath9 , while data usually span over intervals larger than the convergence radius  @xcite . a more sophisticated technique of approximation , the pad approximation , aims to approximate functions by means of a ratio between two polynomials  @xcite .",
    "pad approximation is usually best suited to approximate diverging functions and functions over a whole interval , giving a better approximation than the corresponding truncated taylor series  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    ", pad approximations have been introduced in the context of cosmography , whereas applications have been discussed and extended in  @xcite , but the authors have focused principally on writing the dark energy equation of state as a pad function . in this work we want to propose a new approach to cosmography , based on approximating the luminosity distance by means of pad functions , instead of taylor polynomials . in this way",
    "we expect to have a better match of the model with cosmic data and to overcome possible divergences of the taylor approach at @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , using the pad approximation of the luminosity distances , we also show that one can improve the quality of the fits with respect to the standard re - parametrizations of the luminosity distances by means of auxiliary variables .",
    "we also propose how to deal numerically with such approximations and how to get the most viable pad expansions . as a result",
    ", we will obtain a refined statistical analysis of the cosmographic parameters .",
    "a large part of the work will be devoted to outline the drawbacks and the advantages of this technique and compare it to more standard approaches as taylor series and the use of auxiliary variables .",
    "moreover , we also include a discussion about the most adequate pad types among the wide range of possibilities .",
    "finally , we obtain a reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state which is only based on the observational values of the luminosity distance , over the full range for the redshift in which data are given . in this way , we demonstrate that pad approximations are actually preferred to fit high redshift cosmic data , thus representing a valid alternative technique to reconstruct the universe expansion history at late times .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we highlight the role of cosmography in the description of the present time dynamics of the universe .",
    "in particular , we discuss connections with the cosmographic series and the frw metric . in sec .",
    "[ sec : padeandcosmography ] we introduce the pad formalism and we focus on the differences between standard taylor expansions and rational series in the context of cosmography , giving a qualitative indication that a pad approximation could be preferred .",
    "we also enumerate some issues related to cosmography in the context of the observable universe . for every problem ,",
    "we point out possible solutions and we underline how we treat such troubles in our paper , with particular attention to the pad formalism .",
    "all experimental results have been portrayed in secs .",
    "[ sect : dataset ] and  [ parameterestimations ] , in which we present the numerical outcomes derived both from using the pad technique and standard cosmographic approach . in sec .",
    "[ applicationspade ] we give an application of the pad recipe , that is , we use the pad technique to estimate the free parameters of some known models . in sec .",
    "[ universeeos ] , we discuss the consequences on the equation of state for the universe which can be inferred from our numerical outcomes derived by the use of pad approximants . moreover , in sec .",
    "[ consequencespade ] we discuss our numerical outcomes and we interpret the bounds obtained .",
    "finally , the last section , sec .  [ conclusions ] , is devoted to conclusions and perspectives of our approach .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the role of cosmography and its standard - usage techniques to fix cosmographic constraints on the observable universe .",
    "the great advantage of the cosmographic method is that it permits one to bound present time cosmology without having to assume any particular model for the evolution of dark energy with time .",
    "the _ cosmographic method",
    "_ stands for a coarse grained model independent technique to gather viable limits on the universe expansion history at late times , provided the cosmological principle is valid  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding requirements demanded by cosmography are homogeneity and isotropy with spatial curvature somehow fixed .",
    "common assumptions on the cosmological puzzle provide a whole energy budget dominated by @xmath0 , ( or by some sort of dark energy density ) , with cold dark matter in second place and baryons as a small fraction only .",
    "spatial curvature in case of time - independent dark energy density is actually constrained to be negligible . however , for evolving dark energy contributions , observations are not so restrictive  @xcite .",
    "more details will be given later , as we treat the degeneracy between scalar curvature and variation of the acceleration .",
    "from now on , having fixed the spatial curvature @xmath11 to be zero , all cosmological observables can be expanded around present time . moreover , comparing such expansions to cosmological data allows one to fix bounds on the evolution of each variable under exam .",
    "this strategy matches cosmological observations with theoretical expectations . by doing so",
    ", one gets numerical outcomes which do not depend on the particular choice of the cosmological model , since only taylor expansions are compared with data",
    ". indeed , cosmography relates observations and theoretical predictions , and it is able to alleviate the degeneracy among cosmological models .",
    "cosmography is therefore able to distinguish between models that are compatible with cosmographic predictions and models that have to be discarded , since they do not fit the cosmographic limits .",
    "hence , according to the cosmological principle , we assume the universe to be described by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , i.e. @xmath12 where we use the notation @xmath13 .    as a first example of cosmographic expansions , we determine the scale factor @xmath14 as a taylor series  @xcite around present time @xmath15 .",
    "we have @xmath16 which recovers signal causality if one assumes @xmath17 . from the above expansion of @xmath14",
    ", one defines    [ csdef ] @xmath18    such functions are , by construction , model independent quantities , i.e. they do not depend on the form of the dark energy fluid , since they can be directly bounded by observations .",
    "they are known in the literature as the hubble rate ( @xmath19 ) , the acceleration parameter ( @xmath20 ) , the jerk parameter ( @xmath21 ) , the snap parameter ( @xmath22 ) and the lerk parameter ( @xmath23 )  @xcite .",
    "once such functions are fixed at present time , they are referred to as the _ cosmographic series _ ( cs ) .",
    "this is the set of coefficients usually derived in cosmography from observations .",
    "rewriting @xmath14 in terms of the cs gives @xmath24 where we have normalized the scale factor to @xmath25 . by rewriting eq .",
    "( @xmath26 ) as in eq .",
    "( @xmath27 ) , one can read out the meaning of each parameter .",
    "in fact , each term of the cs displays a remarkable dynamical meaning .",
    "in particular , the snap and lerk parameters determine the shape of hubble s flow at higher redshift regimes",
    ". the hubble parameter must be positive , in order to allow the universe to expand and finally @xmath20 and @xmath21 fix kinematic properties at lower redshift domains .",
    "indeed , the value of @xmath20 at a given time specifies whether the universe is accelerating or decelerating and also provides some hints on the cosmological fluid responsible for the dynamics .",
    "let us focus on @xmath20 first .",
    "we can distinguish three cases , splitting the physical interval of viability for @xmath28 :    1 .",
    "@xmath29 , shows an expanding universe which undergoes a deceleration phase .",
    "this is the case of either a matter dominated universe or any pressureless barotropic fluid .",
    "observations do not favor @xmath30 at present times , which however appears relevant for early time cosmology , where dark energy did not dominate over matter .",
    "2 .   @xmath31 , represents an expanding universe which is currently speeding up .",
    "this actually represents the case of our universe .",
    "the universe is thought to be dominated by some sort of anti - gravitational fluid , as stressed in sec .",
    "[ intro ] . in turn",
    ", cosmography confirms such characteristics , without postulating any particular form of dark energy evolution .",
    "3 .   @xmath32 , indicates that all the whole cosmological energy budget is dominated by a de sitter fluid , i.e. a cosmic component with constant energy density which does not evolve as the universe expands .",
    "this is the case of inflation at the very early universe .",
    "however at present - time this value is ruled - out by observations .",
    "besides , the variation of the acceleration provides a way to understand whether the universe passes or not through a deceleration phase . precisely , the variation of acceleration , i.e. @xmath33 , is related to @xmath21 as @xmath34 at present time , we therefore have @xmath35 and since we expect @xmath36 , we get that @xmath37 .",
    "thus if @xmath38 , then @xmath39 is linked to the sign of the variation of @xmath20 .",
    "we will confirm from observations that it actually lies in the interval @xmath40 .",
    "accordingly we can determine three cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath41 the universe does not show any departure from the present time accelerated phase .",
    "this would indicate that dark energy influences early times dynamics , without any changes throughout the universe evolution . even though this may be a possible scenario ,",
    "observations seem to indicate that this does not occur and it is difficult to admit that the acceleration parameter does not change its sign as the universe expands .",
    "@xmath42 indicates that the acceleration parameter smoothly tends to a precise value , without changing its behavior as @xmath43 .",
    "no theoretical considerations may discard or support this hypothesis , although observations definitively show that a model compatible with zero jerk parameter badly fits current cosmological data .",
    "@xmath44 implies that the universe acceleration started at a precise time during the evolution .",
    "usually , one refers to the corresponding redshift as the _ transition redshift _",
    "@xcite , at which dark energy effects actually become significative . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath45 indicates the presence of a further cosmological _",
    "resource_. by a direct measurement of the transition redshift @xmath46 , one would get relevant constraints on the dark energy equation of state .",
    "it turns out that the sign of @xmath39 corresponds to a change of slope of universe s dynamics .",
    "rephrasing it differently , a positive @xmath39 definitively forecasts that the acceleration parameter should change sign at @xmath47 .",
    "a useful trick of cosmography is to re - scale the cs by means of the hubble rate . in other words , it is possible to demonstrate that if one takes into account @xmath48 cosmographic coefficients , only @xmath49 are really independent . from definitions  ( [ csdef ] ) , one can write    [ hpunto ] @xmath50\\,,\\\\ \\ddddot{h } = & h^5 \\left [ l - 5s + 10 ( q + 2 ) j + 30 ( q + 2 ) q + 24\\right ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and we immediately see the correspondence between derivatives of the hubble parameter and the cs ( note in particular the degeneracy , due to the fact that all these expressions are multiplied by @xmath51 ) .    as a consequence of the above discussion , one can choose a particular set of observable quantities and , expanding it , as well as the scale factor , it is possible to infer viable limits on the parameters . to better illustrate this statement , by means of eqs .",
    "( [ hpunto ] ) , one can infer the numerical values of the cs using the well - known luminosity distance .",
    "in fact , keeping in mind the definition of the cosmological redshift @xmath52 in terms of the cosmic time @xmath53 , that is @xmath54 then the luminosity distance in flat space can be expressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the comoving distance traveled by a photon from redshift @xmath52 to us , at @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath57 can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 further expansions up to order five in @xmath52 that will be used in this work are reported in the appendix  [ appa ] . here , for brevity we reported in eq .",
    "( [ jhgkfh ] ) the expansion up to the second order in @xmath52 .",
    "it is worth noticing that eq .",
    "( [ dltaylor ] ) is general and applies to any cosmological model , provided it is based on a flat frw metric .",
    "thus , by directly fitting the cosmological data for @xmath57 , one gets physical bounds on @xmath28 , @xmath39 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 _ for any cosmological model _ ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the above description , based on common taylor expansions , represents only one of the possible approximations that one may use for the luminosity distance .",
    "it may be argued that such an approximation does not provide adequate convergence for high redshift data .",
    "thus , our aim is to propose possible extensions of the standard taylor treatment , i.e. pad approximants , that could accurately resolve the issues of standard cosmography .    in the next section we will present a different approximation for the luminosity distance , given by rational pad functions instead of taylor polynomials",
    ", we will analyze the relationship with the usual taylor expansion and argue that the rational approximation may be preferred from a theoretical point of view .",
    "later , in secs .  [ sect : dataset ] and  [ parameterestimations ] we will also perform the numerical comparison with observational data , in order to show that one can get improved results from this novel approach .",
    "in this section we introduce the concept of pad approximants and we describe the applications of pad treatment to cosmography .    to do so ,",
    "let us define the @xmath63 pad approximant of a generic function @xmath64 , which is given by the rational function @xmath65 with degree @xmath66 ( numerator ) and @xmath67 ( denominator ) that agrees with @xmath64 and its derivatives at @xmath9 to the highest possible order , i.e. such that @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "pad approximants for given @xmath48 and @xmath69 are unique up to an overall multiplicative constant . as a consequence , the first constant in the denominator",
    "is usually set to one , in order to face this scaling freedom .",
    "hereafter , we follow this standard notation and indicate as @xmath70 the pad approximant of degree @xmath48 at the numerator and @xmath69 in the denominator . as we see , in cosmology one may use direct data through the distance modulus @xmath71 of different astronomical objects , such as e.g. supernovae . in the usual applications of cosmography , the luminosity distance @xmath57 , which enters @xmath71 , is assumed to be a ( truncated ) taylor series with respect to @xmath52 around present time @xmath9 .",
    "a problem with such a procedure occurs when one uses data out of the interval @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , due to the divergence at high redshifts of the taylor polynomials , this can possibly give non - accurate numerical results @xcite .",
    "consequently , data taken over @xmath73 are quite unlikely to accurately fit taylor series .",
    "pad approximants can resolve this issue .",
    "in fact let us consider the general situation when one has to reconstruct a function , supposing to know the values of such a function , taken in the two limits where the independent variable is very small and very large respectively . hence , let us consider two different approximate expansions of @xmath57 .",
    "the first for small values of @xmath52 ( around @xmath9 ) , the second for large values of @xmath52 ( around @xmath74 ) .",
    "the two approximations can be written as    [ sus ] @xmath75    in this way , provided we construct a function that behaves as @xmath76 when @xmath77 and as @xmath78 as @xmath79 , we are sure that in both limits such a function remains finite ( when @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively )",
    ". given such a property , the most natural function able to interpolate our data between those two limits is naturally given by a _ rational function _ of @xmath52 .",
    "pad approximants are therefore adequate candidates to carry on this technique . in the next subsection",
    "we describe some problems associated to cosmography and to the pad formalism .",
    "later , we also propose feasible solutions that we will adopt throughout this work .",
    "we introduce this subsection to give a general discussion about several drawbacks plaguing the standard cosmographic approach . for every single problem",
    ", we describe the techniques of solutions in the framework of pad approximations , showing how we treat pad approximants in order to improve the cosmographic analysis .",
    "degeneracy between coefficients : :    each cosmographic coefficient may be related to @xmath19 , as    previously shown .",
    "this somehow provides that the whole list of    independent parameters is really limited to    @xmath82 .",
    "however , one can think of    measuring @xmath83 through cosmography in any case , assuming    @xmath83 to be a cosmographic coefficient , without loss of    generality .",
    "the problem of degeneracy unfortunately leads to the    impossibility of estimating @xmath83 alone by using    measurements of the distance modulus ,    @xmath84    in the case of supernova observations , as we will see later . from    eq .",
    "( [ dltaylor ] ) it follows that @xmath57 can be factorized    into two pieces : @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath87 , therefore it depends only on    @xmath88 , thus becoming an additive constant in    @xmath89 which can not be estimated , its only effect is to    act as a lever to the logarithm of    @xmath90 ) .",
    "+    in other words , @xmath88 degenerates with the rest of the    parameters . to alleviate such problem , we here make use of two    different data sets , together with supernovae , i.e. the hubble    measurements and the hubble telescope measure . in this way we employ    direct measures of @xmath83 , thus reducing the errors    associated to the degeneracy between cosmographic parameters .",
    "degeneracy with scalar curvature : :    spatial curvature of the frw model enters the luminosity distance ,    since the metric directly depends on it .",
    "thus , geodesics of photons    correspondingly change due to its value .",
    "therefore , any expansion of    @xmath57 depends on @xmath91 as well ,    degenerating the values of the cs with respect to    @xmath91 .",
    "the jerk parameter is deeply influenced by the    value of the scalar curvature and degenerates with it . in our work",
    ", we    overcome this problem through geometrical bounds on    @xmath91 , determined by early time observations .",
    "according to recent measurements , the universe is considered to be    spatially flat and any possible small deviations will not influence    the simple case @xmath92 .",
    "this is the case we    hereafter adopt , except for the last part in which we extensively    investigate the role of @xmath91 in the framework of the    @xmath0cdm model .",
    "dependence on the cosmological priors : :    the choice of the cosmological priors may influence the numerical    outcomes derived from our analyses .",
    "this turns out to be dangerous in    order to determine the signs of the cosmographic coefficients .    however , to alleviate this problem we may easily enlarge all the    cosmological priors , showing that within convergence ranges the cs are    fairly well constrained .",
    "the corresponding problem would indicate    possible departures from convergence limits , if ranges are outside the    theoretical expectations .",
    "hence , we found a compromise for each    cosmological interval , and we report the whole list of numerical    priors in table  [ tab : priors ] .",
    "systematics due to truncated series : :    slower convergence in the best fit algorithm may be induced by    choosing truncated series at a precise order , while systematics in    measurements occur , on the contrary , if series are expanded up to a    certain order . in other words , introducing additional terms would    decrease convergence accuracy , although lower orders may badly    influence the analysis itself . to alleviate this problem",
    ", we will    constrain the parameters through different orders of broadening    samples . in this way",
    ", different orders will be analyzed and we will    show no significative departures from our truncated series order .",
    "dependence on the friedmann equations : :    dark energy is thought to be responsible of the present time    acceleration . however , cosmography is able to describe the current    universe speeding up without the need of postulating a precise dark    energy fluid _ a priori_.",
    "this statement is clearly true only if a    really barotropic fluid is responsible for the dark energy effects .",
    "+    in case there is no significative deviations from a constant equation    of state for pressureless matter and dark energy is provided by some    modification of gravitation , cosmography should be adjusted    consequently .",
    "+    this leads to the implicit choice of assuming general relativity as    the specific paradigm to get constraints on the cosmographic    observables .",
    "one may therefore inquire to what extent cosmography is    really independent of the friedmann equations . rephrasing it    differently , to reveal the correct cosmological model we do not fix    further assumptions , e.g. geometrical constraints , lorentz invariance    violations , and so forth , since we circumscribe our analysis to    general relativity only .",
    "any possible deviations from the standard    approach would need additional theoretical bounds and the    corresponding cs should be adjusted accordingly . however , this problem    does not occur in this work and we can impose limits without the need    of particular assumptions at the beginning of every analysis .",
    "convergence : :    the convergence problem probably represents the most spinous issue of    cosmography .",
    "as we have previously stated , the problem of truncated    series is intimately intertwined to the order chosen for determining    the particular taylor expansion under exam .",
    "unfortunately , almost all    cosmological data sets exceed the bound @xmath93 , which    represents the value around which one expands @xmath57 into a    series . in principle",
    ", all taylor series are expected to diverge when    @xmath94 , as a consequence of the fact that they are    polynomials .",
    "thus , finite truncations get problems to adapt to data    taken at @xmath10 , leading to possible misleading outcomes .    for example , this often provides additional systematic errors because    it is probable that the increase of bad convergence may affect    numerical results . here , we improve accuracy by adopting the union 2.1    supernovae data set and the two additional surveys based on    measurements of @xmath95 , i.e. direct hubble measures and    hubble space telescope measurements . combining these data together",
    "naturally eases the issue of systematics , whereas to overcome finite    truncation problems we manage to develop the so called pad    approximation for different orders . by construction , since pad    approximants represent a powerful technique to approximate functions    by means of ratios of polynomials , one easily alleviates convergence    problems for @xmath10 .",
    "as such , we expect pad approximants    can better approximate the luminosity distance with respect to    standard taylor treatments , especially when high redshift data sets    are employed in the analysis .    +    on the other hand , in order to overcome the problem of divergence ,    precision cosmology employs the use of several re - parametrizations of    the redshift @xmath52 , in terms of _ auxiliary variables _    ( @xmath96 ) , which enlarge the convergence radius    of the taylor expansion to a sphere of radius    @xmath97 .",
    "rephrasing it differently , supposing    that data lie within @xmath98 , any auxiliary    variable restricts the interval in a more stringent ( non - divergent )    range .",
    "a prototype of such an approach is for example given by    @xmath99 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , whose limits in    the past universe ( i.e. @xmath100 ) read    @xmath101 $ ] , while in the future ( i.e.    @xmath102 $ ] ) read @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "the    construction of any auxiliary variable should satisfy some additional    requirements .",
    "it must be feasible to invert it , passing from the    redshift @xmath52 to it , being one to one invertible .",
    "moreover ,    it should not diverge for any values of the redshift @xmath52    ( in this sense , @xmath104 suffers from a divergence problem at    future times ) .",
    "finally , any parametrization needs to behave smoothly    as the universe expands , without showing any critical points .",
    "+    in this work , we also compare pad expansions with the auxiliary    variables proposed in the literature , namely @xmath104 ,    already cited , and @xmath105 , which has been    introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath106 improves    @xmath104 , since it has been constructed by following the    above mentioned recipe to build up _ ad hoc _ auxiliary variables .",
    "one    of our results is that auxiliary variables , albeit being well    consolidated tricks for reducing the convergence problem , behave worse    than pad approximations .",
    "this is probably due to the unknown form of    the correct @xmath96 , which is not known _ a    priori_. to do so , we describe in detail differences between our new    technique of cosmographic investigations which uses pad    approximations versus standard approaches which make use of auxiliary    variables , showing that the convergence problem may be definitively    healed through the use of rational approximations , instead of    constructing auxiliary variables .    in the next subsection",
    "we demonstrate with the help of exactly soluble models that pad approximations indeed improve the accuracy in approximating the luminosity distance .",
    "we stress the fact that this property is more significative as data span over larger intervals of @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath10 .      in this section , we give a qualitative representation of the improvements that one gets by performing a pad approximation of the luminosity distance .",
    "to do so , we plot @xmath57 for known models and compare it with the numerical behavior of different taylor and pad approximations over a large range of @xmath52 .",
    "as two significative examples , we work with the @xmath0cdm and @xmath107cdm models for our elucidative purposes  @xcite . afterwards , we infer a theoretical method to focus on viable pad approximations , by treating powers @xmath48 and @xmath69 , without comparing with particular models .    * the @xmath0cdm model : * the hubble parameter for the @xmath0cdm model reads @xmath108 where @xmath109 , representing the dark energy density , expressed in terms of a pure cosmological constant . performing a numerical integration of @xmath57  ( [ defdl ] )",

    "the same holds to higher orders of both taylor and pad approximations .",
    "therefore , the situation described by the taylor and pad approximants can also be seen as having two different models which give approximately the same values for the cs parameters , albeit providing different evolutions over the whole interval considered .",
    "as one can immediately notice from all plots in fig .",
    "[ lcdmdl ] , taylor approximations ( in blue in the figures ) are really accurate until @xmath52 stays small , whereas they rapidly diverge from the exact curve ( in red ) as @xmath121 . on the contrary , we can see from the first plot that the rational approximant @xmath122 keeps very close to the exact function over the complete interval analyzed .",
    "moreover , as we see in the second and third plots , the situation is the same as we increase the order of the approximants .",
    "in fact , the pad functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 fairly approximate the exact @xmath0cdm luminosity distance over all the interval considered .",
    "in particular , we remark also that the correctness of the approximation not necessarily increases by increasing the order of the approximants ( as expected , since all the possible pad functions have completely different behaviors , depending on the degrees of numerator and denominator ) and that @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 seem to be the best approximations , within the ones considered , giving excellent results .",

    "[ lcdmdl ] and  [ wcdmdl ] clearly show that , provided we are given data over a large interval of values for the cosmological redshift @xmath52 , it would be better to fit the observed luminosity distances with a rational function , in order to get a more realistic function that fits such data over the whole interval . by the same reasoning , the use of pad approximants seems to be also more convenient in order to infer the evolution of @xmath57 from knowledge of the cs . in particular",
    ", it seems that the pad approximants @xmath128 , @xmath130 and @xmath129 give the best approximations , which strongly suggests that the order of the numerator and that of the denominator for these models should be very close to each other , with the former possibly being greater than the latter .",
    "given this fact , in the next section we will give a quantitative analysis of different pad approximations for the luminosity distance , by comparing them with the astronomical data . in this way",
    "we get the best values for the cs parameters by a direct fit using different forms .",
    "as we will see , this novel approach can give better bounds on the parameters , and takes better account of more distant objects , as the pad approximation over a large interval is more reliable than taylor s technique .",
    "the above considerations suggest some theoretical conclusions to build up viable pad rational functions . here",
    ", we formalize a possible recipe to determine which pad rational functions are favored with respect to others .",
    "first , the pad function should smoothly evolve in the redshift range chosen for the particular cosmographic analysis .",
    "naively , this suggests that any possible pad approximant should not have singularities in the observable redshift intervals .",
    "moreover , any pad approximant for @xmath131 must be positive definite and can not show negative regions , otherwise the definition of magnitude would not hold at all . finally , we expect that the degree of the numerator and that of the denominator should be close , with the former a little greater than the latter . keeping this in mind , we are ready to perform our experimental analyses .",
    "to do so , we consider some pad expansions as reported in the following sections .",
    "in this section we present the main aspects of our experimental analysis .",
    "we illustrate how we directly fit general expressions of @xmath57 , in terms of different types of approximations , i.e. taylor ( standard cosmographic approach ) , auxiliary variables and pad expansions ( our novel cosmographic technique ) .",
    "in general all pad approximations , due to their rational forms , may show spurious singularities for certain values of the redshift @xmath52 lying in the interval of data .",
    "in other words , the need of constructing precise pad approximations which are not plagued by divergences due to poles , is actually one of the tasks of our analysis .",
    "in particular , a simple manner to completely avoid such a problem consists in the choice of suitable priors for the free parameters , built up _",
    "ad hoc _ , shifting any possible poles to future time cosmological evolution .",
    "we show that data are confined inside intervals of the form @xmath98 , whereas possible divergences of pad functions are limited to future times , i.e. @xmath132 , and hence do not influence our experimental analysis",
    ". moreover , the cosmological priors adopted here are perfectly compatible with the ones proposed in several previous papers and do not influence the numerical outcomes .",
    "this shows that the pad method does not reduce the accuracy in fitting procedures and it is a good candidate to improve standard methods of cosmographic analyses .",
    "thus , let us investigate the improvements of the pad treatments with respect to standard techniques . to do so",

    "it can be done by means of a direct comparison with each cosmological data set .    for our purposes , we describe three statistical data sets , characterized by different maximum order of parameters , providing a hierarchy among parameters .",

    "as one can see from tabs .",
    "[ table:1dresults1]-[table:1dresults3 ] , the best fit values and errors for the cs parameters estimated using the approximants @xmath122 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 are in good agreement with the sc results . in particular , the approximant @xmath171 gives smaller relative errors than the corresponding sc analysis , thus suggesting that enlarging the approximation order , the analysis by means of pad are increasingly more appropriate than the standard one .",

    "ii , provides a universe which starts decelerating at a particular redshift @xmath46 , named the transition redshift .    from the above considerations , a comparison of our results with the ones obtained previously using pad expansions is essential .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the authors employed a @xmath168 pad approximant , motivating their choice by noticing that for @xmath402 the requirement @xmath403 could be appropriate to describe the behavior of @xmath57 .",
    "their idea was to propose this pad prototype and to use it for higher redshift domains .",
    "their heuristic guess has not been compared in that work with respect to other @xmath70 approximants .",
    "hence , the need of extending their approach has been achieved in the present paper , where we analyzed thoroughly which extensions work better .",
    "moreover , the authors adopted the @xmath168 pad approximant as a first example to describe the convergence radius in terms of the pad formalism , providing discrepancies with respect to standard taylor treatments .",
    "their numerical analyses were essentially based on sneia data only , while in our paper we adopted different data sets , i.e. baryonic acoustic oscillation , hubble space telescope measurements and differential age data , with improved numerical accuracies developed by using the cosmomc code @xcite . as a consequence , we found that the cosmographic results obtained using @xmath122 are significantly different from the ones obtained using @xmath168 .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the authors employed the @xmath168 approximant only , whereas in our paper we reported in fig .",
    "4 the plots of @xmath122 , which definitively provide the differences between @xmath122 and @xmath168 . in general , our results seem to be more accurate and general than the numerical outcomes of @xcite . however , we showed a positive jerk parameter , for sets @xmath404 and @xmath405 , which is compatible with their results , albeit not strictly constrained to @xmath406 , as they proposed .",
    "numerical outcomes for @xmath88 and @xmath28 lie in similar intervals with respect to @xcite . summing up ,",
    "although the use of @xmath168 is possible _ a priori _ , we demonstrated here that considering different models one can find parameterizations that work better than @xmath168 and therefore are more natural candidates for further uses in upcoming works on cosmography .",
    "further , it is of special interest to look at the comparison of the numerical results obtained for the cases of @xmath0cdm , cpl and unified dark energy models by inserting the values estimated by fitting the pad functions @xmath122 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( see sec .",
    "[ applicationspade ] ) . from this analysis",
    "it turns out that all of them suggest small departures from @xmath0cdm , as expected .",
    "moreover , @xmath170 is the one that better reproduces the results of @xmath0cdm .",
    "however , we expect from fig .  [ lcdmdl ] that @xmath123 and @xmath124 should match even better the @xmath0cdm predictions .",
    "therefore , we consider that it is needed to repeat the analysis with a larger set of data in the region @xmath10 to get more reliable results in this sense .",
    "this indication will be object of extensive future works .",
    "finally , let us comment the fact that results of tab .",
    "[ table:1dotherredshifts ] , compared with the ones in tabs .",
    "[ table:1dresults1]-[table:1dresults3 ] , show that the approximants @xmath122 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 give values for the cs parameters that are much closer to the ones estimated by standard cosmography and by the @xmath0cdm model , than the results provided by the introduction of auxiliary variables in the standard cosmographic approach .",
    "this definitively candidates pad approximants to represent a significative alternative to overcome the issues of divergence in cosmography , without the need of any additional auxiliary parametrization .",
    "in this work we proposed the use of pad approximations in the context of observational cosmology . in particular , we improved the standard cosmographic approach , which enables to accurately determine refined cosmographic bounds on the dynamical parameters of the models .",
    "we stressed the fact that the pad recipe can be used as a relevant tool to extend standard taylor treatments of the luminosity distance .",
    "our main goal was to introduce a class of pad approximants able to overcome all the problems plaguing modern cosmography .",
    "to do so , we enumerated the basic properties and the most important demands of the pad treatment and we matched theoretical predictions with modern data .",
    "in particular , the main advantage of the rational cosmographic method is that pad functions reduce the issue of convergence of the standard cosmographic approach based on truncated taylor series , especially for data taken over a larger redshift range . in other words , usual model independent expansions performed at @xmath9",
    "suffer from divergences due to data spanning cosmic intervals with @xmath73 .",
    "since pad approximants are rational functions , thence they can naturally overcome this issue .",
    "in particular , in our numerical treatment , we have considered all the possible pad approximants of the luminosity distance whose order of the numerator and denominator sum up to three , four and five and compared them with the corresponding taylor polynomials of degree three , four and five in @xmath52 . among these models , it turned out that the pad technique can give results similar to those obtained by standard cosmography and also improve the accuracy .",
    "in addition , the pad technique overcomes the need of introducing auxiliary variables , as proposed in standard cosmography to reduce divergences at higher redshifts .",
    "to do so , we compared pad results also with taylor re - parameterized expansions .",
    "in all the cases considered here , our pad numerical outcomes appear to improve the standard analyses .",
    "furthermore , we also considered to overcome the degeneracy problem by employing additional data sets .",
    "in particular , we assumed union 2.1 type ia supernovae , baryonic acoustic oscillation , hubble space telescope measurements and direct observations of hubble rates , based on the differential age method . moreover , all cosmographic drawbacks have also been investigated and treated in terms of pad s recipe , proposing for each problem a possible solution to improve the experimental analyses .",
    "afterwards , we guaranteed our numerical outcomes to lie in viable intervals and we demonstrated that the refined cosmographic bounds almost confirm the standard cosmological paradigm , thus forecasting the sign of the variation of acceleration , i.e. the jerk parameter .",
    "however , although the @xmath0cdm model passes our experimental tests , we can not conclude that evolving dark energy terms are ruled out .",
    "indeed , we compared our pad results with a class of cosmological models , namely the @xmath107cdm model , the chevallier - polarski - linder parametrization and the unified dark energy models , finding a good agreement with those paradigms .",
    "furthermore , we also investigated the consequences of pad s bounds on the universe equation of state . to conclude ,",
    "we have proposed and investigated here the use of pad approximants in the field of precision cosmology , with particular regards to cosmography .",
    "future perspectives will be clearly devoted to describe the pad approach in other relevant fields .",
    "for example , early time cosmology is expected to be more easily described in our framework , as well as additional epochs related to high redshift data . collecting all these results one could in principle definitively reconstruct the universe expansion history , matching late with early time observations and also permitting to understand whether the dark energy fluid evolves or remains a pure cosmological constant at all times .",

    "<S> we propose a novel approach for parameterizing the luminosity distance , based on the use of rational `` pad '' approximations . </S>",
    "<S> this new technique extends standard taylor treatments , overcoming possible convergence issues at high redshifts plaguing standard cosmography . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we show that pad expansions enable us to confidently use data over a larger interval with respect to the usual taylor series . to show this property in detail , </S>",
    "<S> we propose several pad expansions and we compare these approximations with cosmic data , thus obtaining cosmographic bounds from the observable universe for all cases . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we fit pad luminosity distances with observational data from different uncorrelated surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we employ union 2.1 supernova data , baryonic acoustic oscillation , hubble space telescope measurements and differential age data . in so doing , </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the use of pad approximants can improve the analyses carried out by introducing cosmographic auxiliary variables , i.e. a standard technique usually employed in cosmography in order to overcome the divergence problem . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for any drawback related to standard cosmography , we emphasize possible resolutions in the framework of pad approximants . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate how to reduce systematics , how to overcome the degeneracy between cosmological coefficients , how to treat divergences and so forth . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we show that cosmic bounds are actually refined through the use of pad treatments and the thus derived best values of the cosmographic parameters show slight departures from the standard cosmological paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> although all our results are perfectly consistent with the @xmath0cdm model , evolving dark energy components different from a pure cosmological constant are not definitively ruled out . finally , we use our outcomes to reconstruct the effective universe equation of state , constraining the dark energy term in a model independent way . </S>"
