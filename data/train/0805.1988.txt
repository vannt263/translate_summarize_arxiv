    "the physical systems with fractional statistics have been a subject of great interest @xcite .",
    "although initial studies of fractional statistics have focused on two - dimensional systems @xcite , anyons ( the particles obeying the fractional statistics ) have also found application in various one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems @xcite .",
    "recently , many theoretical works have been dedicated to study the 1d anyon gas @xcite since the integrable model of anyon gas with a @xmath8-function interaction was introduced by kundu @xcite despite no proof of the realization of anyon gas in 1d . because the statistical properties is related with the topological order , currently anyons also draw intensive attention in topological quantum computation . particularly , with the rapid progress in the regime of cold atom and with the excellent controllability of the neutral atoms trapped in the optical lattice , cold atom has become a popular experimental platform in many research regimes .",
    "rotating bose - einstein condensates and cold atoms in optical lattice have also been proposed to create , manipulate , and test anyons @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental progress of trapped 1d cold atom systems @xcite has triggered more and more theorists to study the many body physics of 1d correlated systems beyond the mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "further , the ability of tuning the effective 1d interactions by feshbach resonance leads experiment accessible to the strong correlation regime @xcite . in the light of recent experiments , studies of the integrable model",
    "have re - attracted much attention today @xcite because with its exact solution we can obtain the properties in the full physical regime even in the strong correlated limit . by applying the exact solution of lieb - liniger to the 1d interacting bose gas in a hard - wall trap @xcite , the evolution from the bose - einstein condensate to",
    " fermionized \" tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas was explicitly and exactly displayed in our previous works @xcite , which has also been confirmed by various numerical methods @xcite .",
    "although the density distribution of bose gas in the limit of infinite repulsion is identical to the free fermi gas @xcite , the momentum distributions exhibit quite different properties from the free fermi gas because of their respective statistics @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the different permutation symmetry leads to the physics of bose gases in many aspects differing from the physics of fermi gases . as a natural generalization , the anyon gas interpolates between the bose and fermi gas .",
    "no doubt the integrable anyon model provides us the possibility to study the effect of generalized permutation symmetry in an exact manner although it is still a theoretically hypothetical model . so far much attention has focused on its thermodynamic properties and correlation functions @xcite , however no general result for the momentum distribution has been given except for the anyon gas in the infinite interaction limit ( or the anyonic tg gas ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the ground state of the 1d anyonic system with finite number of anyons in the whole regime of interaction parameter , and particularly we shall study how the fractional statistics affect the ground state properties , such as the ground state energy and the momentum distribution . by numerically solving the bethe ansatz equations , we obtain the ground state wave function and thus the momentum distribution for different coupling constant and statistics parameter . the obvious properties of anyonic statistics are displayed in the momentum distribution and with the change of statistics parameter the system exhibits the bose statistics , fermi statistics and the fractional statistics in between .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review of 1d anyonic model and introduce its solution with bethe ansatz method . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the density of ground state in quasi - momentum space , ground state energy and momentum distributions for different coupling constant and statistics parameter .",
    "a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "we consider the one dimensional system of @xmath9 anyons in length @xmath10 with second quantized hamiltonian @xmath11 in which @xmath12 is the mass of anyon and @xmath13 denotes the effective interacting constant between anyons .",
    "the field operator @xmath14 and @xmath15 obey the anyonic commutation relations @xmath16 where the sign function @xmath17 gives @xmath18 , @xmath5 or @xmath19 depending on whether @xmath20 is negative , zero , or positive .",
    "@xmath21 is the parameter related with statistics and will be restricted in the regime @xmath22 $ ] in the present work .",

    "a standard rescaling procedure brings the hamiltonian into a dimensionless one @xmath25\\ ] ] with @xmath7 being the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the hamiltonian take the same form as the lieb - liniger bose model except that the field operator satisfy anyonic statistics .",
    "similar to the bose model the eigen problem for the hamiltonian can be reduced to solve the problem of @xmath9-anyons with @xmath26-interaction @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 the anyonic commutation relations require the wavefunction satisfy the generalized symmetry @xmath29 with the anyonic phase @xmath30 .\\ ] ] using the coordinate bethe ansatz we can obtain the wavefunction @xmath31 where @xmath32 is used to label the region @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the step function . in different region",
    "the phase factors of the wavefunction are determined by @xmath35 , which results in the exchange symmetry dictated by eq .",
    "( [ smy ] ) . the wave function @xmath36 is taken as the bethe ansatz type @xmath37 , \\label{wavfunc}\\ ] ] in order to get a physical result , the twisted boundary condition @xcite @xmath38 is used here . under the twisted boundary condition",
    ", we have the bethe ansatz equations @xmath39 with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the renormalized coupling constant and @xmath42 the statistics parameter .",
    "it is deserved to notice that the system is reduced to the lieb - liniger boson model when @xmath43 and the system is reduced to the free fermi one when @xmath44 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath45 take the form of @xmath46 in which @xmath47 denotes a @xmath48 sign factor associated with even ( odd ) permutations . with the set of quantum number @xmath49 known as quasimomentum",
    "the energy eigenvalue and the total momentum can be formulated as @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "the set of @xmath58 is unique and real , therefore the density of state in @xmath2 space @xmath59 can be formulated as @xcite @xmath60 in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the density of ground state in quasi - momentum @xmath2 space with the interaction parameter @xmath7 fixed to @xmath61 for several @xmath4 . it is shown that the density of state of anyons with coupling constant @xmath7 and statistical parameter @xmath4 is identical to the density of state of lieb - liniger bose model with effective coupling constant @xmath62 .",
    "this is clear by comparing the bethe ansatz equation ( [ bae ] ) with that of lieb - liniger model @xcite . when @xmath43 , the model is reduced to bose model and @xmath2 mainly distribute in the regime around zero . while for the case of @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 with @xmath65 even for the weak coupling @xmath61 , which is the same as the situation of @xmath66 of the lieb - liniger bose model . here",
    "the statistics parameter @xmath4 affects the density of state in quasi - momentum space only by renormalizing the coupling constant @xmath7 into @xmath3 . for the case of @xmath61",
    ", we note that when @xmath4 approaches @xmath6 minor change of @xmath4 will result in the great change of the density of ground state in @xmath2 space .",
    "for instance , there are obvious difference among the densities corresponding to @xmath67 , and @xmath6 due to the dramatic changes of the effective coupling constant @xmath68 and @xmath69 correspondingly . in fig .",
    "2 , we display the ground - state energy versus @xmath4 for different coupling constant @xmath7 . the ground - state energy increases with the increase of @xmath4 and the coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "for the weak coupling the energy of the system is small for most @xmath4 but it abruptly increases and arrives at the maximum when @xmath4 approach @xmath6 . in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath70 )",
    "the ground - state energy is almost a constant independent of the statistics parameter .",
    "similarly the ground - state energy of the anyon gas with coupling constant @xmath7 and statistical parameter @xmath4 is identical to that of the corresponding bose gas with effective coupling constant @xmath62 .",

    "( [ energy ] ) and ( [ bae ] ) , we see that the energy level structure of the anyon gas is exactly the same as the corresponding bosonic model with renormalized coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "therefore the thermodynamic properties of the anyon gas are the same as the well known thermodynamic properties of the 1d boson gas @xcite with the effective coupling @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that the intrinsic difference between the anyon gas and the corresponding bose gas is hard to be distinguished just by the thermodynamic properties .",
    "however , due to the different exchange symmetry of the wave functions , the observables associated with the wave functions rather than the square of wave functions , such as the off - diagonal reduced density matrix and the momentum distributions , should display quite different behaviors . in terms of the ground state wave function @xmath83",

    ", the momentum distribution shows a typical boson - type distribution with an obvious peak around the zero momentum point , whereas the momentum distribution is identical to that of free spinless fermions at @xmath63 , exhibiting shell structure . in these two situations the momentum distributions",
    "are symmetric .",
    "when @xmath4 deviates from these two extrema points , the momentum distribution becomes asymmetric : the anyons distribute with more probability in the regime of positive momentum whereas with relatively small probability in the other side . with the increase of @xmath4",
    ", the distribution redistributes between the regime of positive and negative @xmath88 , and gets wider with more and more peaks appearing .",
    "finally , @xmath9 peaks appear at @xmath44 and the momentum distribution shows the characteristic shell structure of fermions .    as a comparison , in fig .",
    "4 we display the momentum distribution of the lieb - liniger boson gas for @xmath99 with the renormalized coupling constants @xmath100 and @xmath69 corresponding to those for anyons in fig .",
    "3 , where we have @xmath61 and @xmath101 , and @xmath6 respectively . the momentum distributions for @xmath102 are not obviously different in fig .",
    "4 as they all fall in the weakly interacting regime .",
    "we also display the momentum distribution for @xmath80 in fig .",
    "the height of the peak shrinks with the increase of the repulsive interaction and stronger repulsive interaction between the bosonic atoms tends to spread out the distribution widely . even in the tg limit",
    ", the momentum distribution of bosons does not show shell structure like free fermions .",
    "for all coupling constant , bosons always congregate symmetrically in the regime around @xmath103 with the most probability and with the increase of momentum @xmath88 the probability diminishes rapidly .",
    "obviously , the asymmetry in the momentum distribution of anyons can not be attributed to renormalization of the effective coupling constant and is induced completely by the the permutation symmetry related to statistic parameter @xmath4 , which can be regarded as the indication of anyons .    in order to clarify more clearly the effect induced by the statistic parameter @xmath4",
    ", we show the momentum distributions for the system with @xmath99 and @xmath82 in fig .",
    "5 . in this case",
    "the renormalized coupling constant @xmath66 and the quasimomentum @xmath104 shall be same for arbitrary @xmath4 , therefore the statistics parameter only results in different permutation symmetry embodied in the wavefunction . there appears the similar situation as the case for @xmath61 in fig .",
    "3 . in the bose limit ( @xmath43 ) and in the fermi limit ( @xmath105 ) the momentum distributions are symmetric while in between the distributions take on the nonsymmetric profiles and evolve from a bose distribution into a free spinless fermi distribution with the increase of @xmath4 .",
    "the difference from the case of weak coupling is that the system distributes in a wider regime relative to that of weak coupling .",
    "mathematically , the asymmetric momentum distribution is induced by the existence of imaginary part of the density matrix ( see appendix for detail ) , which is an odd function of statistical parameter such that the peak at positive momentum in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "5 is a result of the choice of positive @xmath4 , and the peak will shift to negative momentum if @xmath4 is negative .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the ground - state properties of 1d anyon gas based on the exact bethe ansatz solution for arbitrary coupling constant ( @xmath0 ) and statistics parameter ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the density of state in quasimomentum space and the ground - state energy are determined by the renormalized coupling constant @xmath3 . the anyonic system with coupling constant @xmath7 and statistics parameter @xmath4 has the same density of state and energy as those of the lieb - liniger bose model with coupling @xmath106/2 ) .",
    "besides the renormalization of the effective coupling constant , the additional effect induced by the statistics exhibits in the momentum distribution . while in the limit of @xmath43 and @xmath63 , the anyon gas is reduced to the bose gas and free spinless fermi gas , respectively , with both of momentum distributions being symmetric .",
    "when the statistics parameter deviates from these two points , the momentum distribution is asymmetric and evolves from the bose distribution to fermi distribution with the increase of @xmath4 . although the thermodynamic properties of anyon sytem are even functions of the statistic parameter @xmath4 because the renormalized coupling constant is even function of it , the momentum distribution is not so because of the existence of the imaginary part of the non - diagonal part of the one body density matrix , which is an odd function of @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath4 is negative the momentum distribution is equal to the distribution for positive @xmath4 with the mapping between the positive momentum and negative momentum .",
    "our results interpolate between the known results of bose and fermi gas and clarify the effect of generalized permutation symmetry of the anyon gas in an exact manner .",
