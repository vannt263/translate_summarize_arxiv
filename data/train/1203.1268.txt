    "<S> encompasses our prescription that the carrier must be separable from @xmath22 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , eq .   ensures that non - vanishing entanglement is established by exchanging the carrier . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that non - vanishing @xmath48 entanglement does not necessarily imply the possibility of creating @xmath49 entanglement via the local decoding operation on @xmath23 mentioned above . indeed , if this was always possible , bound entanglement  @xcite would not exist , as one could always map entanglement into two - qubit entanglement , which is known to be distillable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in many relevant cases , including all our examples , entanglement can be localized as shown by the theorem 2 in the appendix .    in order to satisfy the conditions , besides the discord present in @xmath32 , there must be discord on the receiver side already in the initial state @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen by applying eq .   again , but with the roles of @xmath21 and @xmath20 interchanged , and using the fact that discord does not increase under operations on the unmeasured systems  @xcite , arriving to @xmath51 if eq </S>",
    "<S> .   holds , we obtain the relation @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> note that if @xmath20 is initially not correlated with @xmath53 , tha latter further simplifies to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting limiting case of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is when @xmath55 . then @xmath21 is classical initially and therefore also in the state @xmath32 after the encoding : @xmath56 . in this case entanglement between alice and bob </S>",
    "<S> can only be created if the carrier is entangled with the sites and , in particular , only if at least one @xmath57 is entangled . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , such @xmath32 simply describes a situation in which bob , upon reading the index @xmath36 encoded in @xmath21 , knows which of many states @xmath57 he will end up sharing with alice .    on the other hand , entanglement creation with a separable carrier is possible starting from a state with @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it is enough to consider the three - qubit example given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but starting with @xmath22 and @xmath20 interchanged and using a step in the encoding operation @xmath47 to undo the change before proceeding with the original protocol </S>",
    "<S> . however , under further restrictions , the classicality of @xmath22 may prevent entanglement creation with a separable carrier , as shown for instance in theorem 3 in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we note that when the encoding operation is restricted to be unitary , the presence of discord ( on either party ) is not a sufficient precondition to make entanglement creation with a separable carrier possible . </S>",
    "<S> this follows by combining the fact that any bipartite state that is sufficiently mixed is separable  @xcite and the existence of discordant states infinitesimally close to any non - discordant one  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as unitary operations do not change mixedness , discord of sufficiently mixed states can not be converted into entanglement .    finally , for a fixed dimension of the carrier , it is more efficient to use an entangled carrier rather than a separable one . on one hand , by sending a @xmath59-dimensional system that is maximally entangled with a similar one that remains with the sender </S>",
    "<S> , we can increase the shared entanglement by @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , theorem 4 of the appendix shows that using separable states the entanglement increase is strictly smaller than @xmath60 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ examples.__in order to make our result more concrete , in appendix we provide new examples of both the creation and the increase of entanglement between distant parties by the exchange of an unentangled carrier . </S>",
    "<S> the examples are based on the fact that the state of a bipartite system of total dimensions @xmath61 having the form @xmath62 is separable if and only if @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the two largest schmidt coefficients of the bipartite state @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the maximally mixed state of the total system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider now a tripartite pure state @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this state admits three schmidt decompositions corresponding to the three bipartitions @xmath48 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> one can choose @xmath66 such that @xmath71 is the lowest across the @xmath48 bipartition , so that there is a finite range for @xmath72 such that @xmath73 is @xmath48-entangled but separable in the remaining two splittings . </S>",
    "<S> such a @xmath74 is meant to play the role of @xmath32 in our scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the three - qubit example of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite uses a carrier system @xmath20 that is initially classically correlated with @xmath22 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a scenario where @xmath20 initially shares no correlation with the remote nodes is more relevant from a practical point of view , as one can imagine that the carrier is an independent system to be used to distribute entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> even with such a restriction , entanglement can be established via a separable system , as proven explicitly by our examples in the appendix .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions.__it is the very act of physical transmission of a carrier system that changes the amount of correlations between the remote laboratories . to illustrate this consider total correlations , as captured by mutual information . </S>",
    "<S> one expects from the principle of no - signaling or information causality  @xcite that the increase of mutual information is bounded by the amount of communicated correlations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , applying the chain rule for mutual information and its monotonicity under local operations  @xcite one finds @xmath75 both in classical and quantum information theory , the increase of total correlations between the labs is bounded by the correlations between the systems that are kept stored in the labs and the carrier  the communicated total correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> however , whereas there is only one kind of correlations between classical random variables , quantum systems can share different kinds of correlations  @xcite . in this work we proved a relation analogous to eq .   for the increase of quantum entanglement between remote elements of a quantum network . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that such increase is bounded from above by the amount of non - classical correlations between the exchanged carrier and the distant nodes as measured by quantum discord , a quantifier for a more general type of non - classical correlations than entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that , in contrast with what one would expect extrapolating from eq .  , our bound for the entanglement increase is in general larger than the entanglement between the carrier and the nodes </S>",
    "<S> ; in particular , it can be non - zero even when the latter vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this has to be the case , as implied by the seminal example of entanglement distribution using a separable carrier of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> besides providing a natural operational interpretation of quantum discord as the truly necessary prerequisite for the success of entanglement distribution , our work identifies the conditions for the occurrence of entanglement distribution with a separable carrier . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario tackled by our study is general enough to fit well with a few experimental settings , including cavity / circuit - qed and trapped - ion technology and we thus hope that our results will find a prompt experimental demonstration .    _ </S>",
