    "the layered cobaltite , na@xmath9coo@xmath1 with @xmath10 0.5,@xcite is known to exhibit metallic conductivity @xmath11 and an extraordinarily large seebeck coefficient @xmath12 ( above + 100  @xmath3v / k at 300  k ) simultaneously , probably due to a strong correlation between the 3@xmath13 electrons of the co ions.@xcite the crystal structure of na@xmath9coo@xmath1 with 0.5 @xmath14 0.75 was reported to be a bronze - type hexagonal system of space group @xmath15 ( @xmath16  nm and @xmath17  nm for @xmath18 = 0.71).@xcite in this structure , the single coo@xmath1 sheets and the single disordered na planes form alternating stacks along the hexagonal @xmath19 axis .",
    "the coo@xmath1 sheets , in which a two - dimensional - triangular lattice of co ions is formed by a network of edge - sharing coo@xmath20 octahedra , are believed to be the conduction planes .",
    "this is because the coo@xmath1 sheet is a common structural component for all known thermoelectric layered cobaltites , _",
    "i.e. _ , na@xmath9coo@xmath1 , ca@xmath21co@xmath22o@xmath23@xcite and bi@xmath1sr@xmath1co@xmath1o@xmath24.@xcite moreover , if the interaction between 3@xmath13 electrons plays a significant role on their transport properties , such interaction should also affect the magnetism of these cobaltites .    recently , motohashi _ et al . _ studied the bulk susceptibility of polycrystalline na@xmath0coo@xmath1 and reported the existence of a magnetic transition at 22  k (= @xmath4 ) accompanying the increase in the slope of the resistivity-_vs._-@xmath25 curve and the appearance of the large positive magnetoresistance effect .",
    "no transitions were found in na@xmath8coo@xmath1 down to 2  k.@xcite interestingly , both @xmath11 and @xmath12 of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 were significantly larger than those of na@xmath8coo@xmath1.@xcite in other words , the thermoelectric properties of na@xmath9coo@xmath1 seem to be enhanced by the magnetic interaction between 3@xmath13 electrons which induces the magnetic transition .",
    "the measurements on heat capacity ( @xmath26 ) and spontaneous magnetization suggested that only a very small fraction ( less than 1% ) of the na@xmath0coo@xmath1 sample changed to the magnetic phase even at 2  k,@xcite although the sample was confirmed to be single phase by powder x - ray diffraction analysis at ambient temperature , leaving open the possibility that the magnetic transition is due to an undetected impurity phase .",
    "however , such small impurity phase is unlikely to induce the observed change in the transport properties below @xmath4 . therefore , to investigate the magnetism of na@xmath9coo@xmath1 in greater detail",
    ", we have measured both weak ( @xmath7 100  oe ) transverse - field positive muon spin rotation and relaxation ( wtf-@xmath2sr ) and zero field ( zf- ) @xmath2sr spectra in both na@xmath0coo@xmath1 and na@xmath8coo@xmath1 at temperatures below 300  k. the former method is sensitive to local magnetic order _ via _ the shift of the @xmath2 spin precession frequency and the enhanced @xmath2 spin relaxation , while zf-@xmath2sr is sensitive to weak local magnetic [ dis]order in samples exhibiting quasi - static paramagnetic moments .",
    "samples of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 and na@xmath8coo@xmath1 were synthesized by a modified solid state reaction technique , _",
    "i.e. _ , a `` rapid heat - up '' technique , which was developed by motohashi _ et al._@xcite to control the na content precisely , using reagent - grade na@xmath1co@xmath21 and co@xmath21o@xmath22 powders as starting materials .",
    "the mixed powder was placed into the furnace , which was preheated at 750@xmath27c , and fired for 12 hours .",
    "the fired powder was thoroughly ground and pressed into a plate of 10  mm length , 15  mm width and 3  mm thickness , and then the plate was sintered at 900@xmath27c for 12 hours .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction studies indicated that the samples were single phase of a hexagonal structure of space group @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath28-na@xmath9coo@xmath1 phase .",
    "the lattice parameters of the na@xmath0coo@xmath1 sample were calculated as @xmath29 = 0.2828  nm and @xmath19 = 1.0884  nm , and for na@xmath8coo@xmath1 , @xmath29 = 0.2826  nm and @xmath19 = 1.0926  nm .",

    "the experimental setup and techniques were described elsewhere.@xcite",
    "the wtf-@xmath2sr spectra for both samples were fitted in the time domain with an exponentially damped ( relaxing ) precessing signal : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the initial asymmetry , @xmath32 is the muon spin polarization function , @xmath33 is the muon larmor frequency , @xmath34 is the initial phase of the precession and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the asymmetry and exponential relaxation rate .",

    "below 300  k , @xmath35 for na@xmath0coo@xmath1 is almost constant ( @xmath7 0.21 ) down to 50  k , then @xmath35 decreases further at lower @xmath25 , and @xmath35 = 0.018 at 2.5  k , while @xmath35 for na@xmath8coo@xmath1 is nearly independent of @xmath25 down to 2.5  k. on the other hand , @xmath36 for both samples increases slightly with decreasing @xmath25 due to the effect of the nuclear magnetic moments in the paramagnetic state .",
    "a marked decrease in @xmath36 is observed below 50  k only for na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "these results clearly indicate that na@xmath0coo@xmath1 undergoes a magnetic transition below 50  k. since @xmath35 is roughly proportional to the volume of paramagnetic phases in the sample , the volume fraction @xmath38 of the magnetic phase at the lowest temperature measured is estimated to be @xmath714% .",

[ fig : zfmusrspectra ] .",
    "indeed , the zf-@xmath2sr time spectra were best fitted with a combination of three exponential relaxation functions ( for the signals due to a clear static magnetic field ) and a gaussian kubo - toyabe function ( for the signal from muon sites experiencing disordered magnetic fields ) : @xmath39 where @xmath31 is the empirical maximum experimental muon decay asymmetry , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 = 1 , 2 and 3 ) are the asymmetries and exponential relaxation rates associated with the three oscillating signals , @xmath43 is the asymmetry of the gaussian kubo - toyabe signal and @xmath44 is the static width of the local frequencies at the disordered sites , and @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is muon gyromagnetic ratio ) is the muon precession frequency in the characteristic local magnetic field @xmath47 due to the static magnetic field .",

[",
    "fig : fft ] ) .",
    "however , the ratio between @xmath43 and @xmath51 is @xmath7 4.5 at 2.5  k ; this indicates that @xmath7 80% muons in the sample experience a disordered magnetic field .",
    "since the magnetic properties of na@xmath9coo@xmath1 are highly sensitive to @xmath18 , a slight reduction in @xmath18 makes the sample nonmagnetic in the whole range of temperature.@xcite indeed , the wtf-@xmath2sr experiment on the na - poor sample , na@xmath8coo@xmath1 , exhibited no magnetic ordering down to 2.5  k ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wtf - musr ] ) .",
    "thus , the na@xmath0coo@xmath1 sample , although structurally single phase , is found to be partially nonmagnetic , _",
    "i.e. _ , magnetically inhomogeneous , probably because of a low local na concentration .",
    "the @xmath38-_vs._-@xmath25 curve is also fairly flat ( @xmath7 20% ) below @xmath4 , similarly to the @xmath51-_vs._-@xmath25 curve .",
    "this indicates that @xmath7 20% of the sample exhibits the transition to the ordered phase at 22  k , and the volume of the ordered phase does not change down to 2.5  k. since @xmath38 = 21% at 2.5  k , it is concluded that this transition is not induced by impurity phases but is an intrinsic behavior of the na@xmath0coo@xmath1 sample .",
    "moreover , this suggests that the ordered phase is responsible for the change in the transport properties below @xmath4 .",
    "the internal magnetic fields of the three signals , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath54 with @xmath42 = 1 , 2 and 3 , exhibit a similar temperature dependence .",
    "that is , as @xmath25 decreases , each @xmath55 increases , with a decreasing slope d@xmath55/d@xmath25 , and level off to a constant value below 5  k. here , it is worth noting that the @xmath55-_vs._-@xmath25 curve indicates the change in an order parameter of the transition .",
    "thus , the moderate temperature dependence of @xmath55 just below @xmath4 suggests that the transition is likely to be discontinuous , whereas @xmath56 supported a continuous transition.@xcite    the values of @xmath34 range between 3.5 and -16 degrees ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zfmusr](e ) ) .",
    "this fact , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath57 , indicates that the ordered phase is a either a usual ferromagnet , an antiferromagnet , a ferrimagnet or a commensurate ( c ) spin density wave ( sdw ) state but not an incommensurate ( ic ) sdw state , as found for example for ca@xmath21co@xmath22o@xmath23@xcite and the zn and si doped cugeo@xmath21",
    "the three exponential relaxation signals and their @xmath55- _ vs._-@xmath25 curves suggest that there are three inequivalent microscopically ordered muon@xmath6 sites in the na@xmath0coo@xmath1 sample .",
    "the possible muon@xmath6 sites are bound to the oxygen ions in the coo@xmath1 sheets ( the o site ) and the two vacant sites in the na planes , namely the na(1 ) and na(2 ) sites ( see table i).@xcite the bond length @xmath13 of co - o ,",
    "co - na(1 ) and co - na(2 ) are 0.1914 , 0.2703 , and 0.3161  nm , respectively . since the dipolar field is proportional to @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 should be rather small compared with @xmath61 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the experimental result ; that is , ( @xmath62 , while @xmath63/@xmath64 at 2.5  k ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zfmusr](d ) ) .",
    "thus , muons@xmath6 are unlikely to be located at the vacant na sites but near the o site .",
    "the width of the fft and the relaxation of the oscillating signals suggest that the field at the o site is inhomogeneously broadened probably due to variations in the bond length @xmath65 caused by the excess na in the na planes .",
    ".[tab : table1]structural parameters for na@xmath66coo@xmath1 with @xmath29 = 0.2840  nm and @xmath19 = 1.0811  nm.@xcite @xmath67 means the occupancy of the site . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the transition is obviously induced by the ordering of the co spins in the coo@xmath1 sheets .",
    "if we assume that the muons experiencing the ordered field are bound to oxygen , then we can estimate the ordered co moment as @xmath7 0.18  @xmath68 at 2.5  k , using @xmath69 = 3.3  mhz and @xmath65 = 0.1914  nm . considering the number of the nearest neighboring co ions for the o site (= 3 ) and the small volume fraction of the magnetic phase ( @xmath7 21% ) , this value is still 100 times larger than that estimated by the magnetization measurement ( 1.2 @xmath70 10@xmath71  @xmath68 at 2  k).@xcite such large discrepancy is difficult to explain based only on the present results .    the related compound , ca@xmath21co@xmath22o@xmath23 , _ i.e. _ , [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath21]@xmath73[coo@xmath1 ] where rs denotes a rocksalt - type subsystem , exhibits two magnetic transitions below 300  k;@xcite one is a transition to an ic - sdw state at @xmath7 30  k and the other to a ferrimagnetic state at 19  k. the ic - sdw is considered to be induced by ordering of the co moments in the [ coo@xmath1 ] subsystem , whereas the ferrimagnetic ordering is reported to be caused by the interlayer coupling between the co moments in the [ coo@xmath1 ] and [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath21 ] subsystems@xcite .    therefore , there is a possibility that na@xmath0coo@xmath1 below @xmath4 enters either a ferrimagnet or a commensurate sdw state , because such magnetic ordering would decrease the bulk magnetization drastically . in the former case ,",
    "the co moments are likely to align ferromagnetically in the coo@xmath1 sheets but antiferromagnetically along the @xmath19 axis . in order to investigate the magnetism of na@xmath9coo@xmath1 in further detail , not only @xmath2sr but also neutron diffraction and @xmath75co - nmr measurements are necessary for single crystals with various @xmath18 .",
    "we measured positive muon - spin - rotation and relaxation ( @xmath2sr ) spectra in a polycrystalline na@xmath0coo@xmath1 sample below 300  k. at temperatures below 22  k (= @xmath4 ) , zero field @xmath2sr spectra exhibited clear oscillations due to static internal magnetic fields , although the volume fraction of the magnetically ordered phase was only @xmath721% at 2.5  k. furthermore , the co moment estimated by the present @xmath2sr experiment was @xmath7 100 times larger than that estimated from the magnetization measurement .",
    "this suggested that the ordered phase is in either a ferrimagnet or a commensurate spin density wave state .",
    "in addition , a large fraction of the muons , given by @xmath43 ( kt background ) was found to experience a broad distribution of fields , perhaps reflecting the disorder due to the excess na .",
