    "q - balls are non - topological solitons appearing in lagrangians of scalar fields with a global @xmath2 or @xmath3 symmetry . though they appeared as a rather mathematical object @xcite , through a series of papers they revealed their physical properties @xcite .",
    "q - balls can be observed at , or near , the minimum of the @xmath4 quantity , where @xmath5 is the potential and @xmath6 is the scalar field . at the above minimum",
    "one can prove that the energy is minimized with respect to the charge .",
    "the minimum of this quantity should be less than the particle mass , in order the soliton to be stable .",
    "much more interest was concentrated on the subject when their possible existence in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model was considered @xcite , where the @xmath2 charge is for example the baryon number of the supersymmetric partners of baryons .",
    "flat @xmath2 directions in the potential of such extensions can offer a plausible explanation to the problem of baryogenesis ( @xcite ) .",
    "another type of q - ball type solutions has been studied , namely the so - called non - abelian q - balls @xcite where we have scalar fields in a lagrangian with a global @xmath7 or @xmath8 symmetry usually and the fields belong to the adjoint representation of the symmetry group .",
    "such particles may correspond to the sgauginos in @xmath9 supersymmetric theories .",
    "also , q - balls with a local @xmath2 symmetry have been studied in @xcite .    in a recent series of papers @xcite ,",
    "a great number of @xmath0 flat directions in the superpotential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and a rich phenomenology concerning them have been investigated .",
    "so the plausible question is to ask if a new type of q - balls can appear in such directions , enriching the particle phenomenology . in the present work",
    "we try to do the following three things : a)we present the general formalism concerning q - balls when the fields transform according to the doublet representation of the symmetry group because this case has not been studied and may turn out to be useful in the search of q - solitons composed of supersymmetric partners of the usual leptons .",
    "b)we present the formalism of gauged q - balls which describe scalar particles with  weak \" interactions .",
    "c)we fully investigate the properties of the above solitons both analytically and numerically in the so - called thin- and thick - wall approximation .",
    "our main interest is to verify their stability when varying the gauge coupling , the frequency with which the soliton field rotates within its internal @xmath0 space , or other phenomenological parameters .",
    "we regard a lagrangian @xmath11 characterized by a global @xmath0 symmetry concerning the couple of scalar fields : @xmath12 the energy is provided by the equation @xmath13 the currents are three as the generators of the algebra considered .",
    "these currents are @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the pauli matrices : @xmath16    we choose @xmath17 in the so - called thin - wall approximation we choose @xmath18 a step - function , with a constant value within a volume @xmath19 and zero outside .",
    "we also choose a spherically symmetric configuration , i.e. @xmath20 so as to minimize the contribution of the surface effects to the total energy .",
    "so the energy can be written @xmath21 and using the chosen field configuration : @xmath22    we can now define the charges in the above thin - wall approximation where we take @xmath23 where the definitions : @xmath24 and @xmath25 hold .",
    "we now want to write energy as a function of the charges .",
    "it is a matter of simple algebra to show that : @xmath26 regarding energy as a function of the volume and minimizing it with respect to the volume , we take that the minimum is at : @xmath27 and the energy takes the form : @xmath28    the energy of the free particles carrying charge @xmath29 is @xmath30 .",
    "( it is a matter of simple algebra to prove this .",
    "the physical interpretation is obvious because we now have two particles , each with mass @xmath31 . )",
    "so if the quantity @xmath32 is less than the mass of the free particles then the energy of the ( [ 14 ] ) field configuration is less than the energy of the free waves and the soliton is preserved stable against decaying into free particles . we know that @xmath33 , quantity is both conserved , as every single current is conserved , and @xmath0 invariant",
    "we now investigate a potential of fourth power in @xmath34 , namely : @xmath35 this is the more general potential of fourth order in the fields .",
    "the theory is non - renormalizable but this is not a serious problem as we can regard the lagrangian as a phenomenological one .",
    "this potential can be proved very useful in a supersymmetric theory . making the rescallings @xmath36 , @xmath37 and defining @xmath38",
    "we take @xmath39 minimizing the @xmath40 quantity with respect to the field and calling it @xmath41 we can take that the minimum is at @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "it is easy then to verify that @xmath46 .",
    "the lagrangian for the case with a local @xmath0 symmetry is written @xmath47 where : @xmath48 and @xmath1 is the coupling constant .",
    "we now regard : a)spherically symmetric fields in order to minimize the contribution to the total energy of the so - called surface effects .",
    "b)static gauge fields .",
    "c)only the zero component of the gauge field differing from zero , the other components being equal to zero .",
    "this is not a gauge - fixing but a statement that the gauge field configuration is static and , consequently , the magnetic fields absent .",
    "d)@xmath49 finite everywhere and zero at infinity .",
    "if we also use the initial ansatz for the scalar field we take for the lagrangian : @xmath50 where latin indices run from 1 to 3 and greek indices run from 0 to 3 .    defining @xmath51 regarding @xmath52 as a constant and after a little algebra",
    "we take @xmath53\\ , \\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the radius @xmath54 and the last term can be absent if @xmath55 is a step - function .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the above fields @xmath56 , @xmath57 , are @xmath58 @xmath59 the total energy of the field configuration can be written @xmath60\\ .\\ ] ]    now we will find the total charge .",
    "a component of the current is defined as : @xmath61 \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }    \\frac{\\imath}{2}{\\tau}_{\\alpha } & 0 \\\\    0 & -\\frac{\\imath}{2}{\\tau}_{\\alpha}^{\\ast } \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c }    \\vec{\\varphi } \\\\",

[ 35 ] in [ 34 ] we can take an asymptotic relation connecting @xmath65 , or equivalently @xmath66 and @xmath67 , when @xmath68 .",
    "the relation is : @xmath69 also for large @xmath54 , @xmath56 is small , so as to have a localized solution of the equations of motion , so @xmath70 and equation ( [ 30 ] ) takes the form : @xmath71 the solution of which has the asymptotic form : @xmath72 , with @xmath73 the @xmath74 component of the @xmath56 doublet . in order to avoid oscillatory solutions we demand that @xmath75 .",
    "another useful relation can be taken from the asymptotic forms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 and from relations ( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 35]):@xmath76\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath77 as defined above .",
    "so , if this energy is less than the energy of the free particles the soliton is stable against decaying to free particles .",
    "we will now try to find a solution corresponding to a quite large soliton in the thin - wall approximation .",
    "we will also take some general properties of the soliton .",
    "the more convenient method for solving the euler - lagrange equations is to regard the  matter \" field @xmath78 as a constant within a certain volume . in order to minimize the surface contribution to the total energy we regard the field configuration as spherical .",
    "the final scope of our work is to find an expression of the energy with respect to the charge , as we do in the global @xmath0 case .",
    "we will minimize the energy firstly with respect to the radius of the soliton and then with respect to the field value , as is the usual practice in the treatment of q - balls .",
    "we will use the following approximations : a)the thin - wall approximation for the matter field @xmath56 .",
    "b)the assumption of small coupling constant , @xmath1 .",
    "we will not use the approximate asymptotic relation for the energy given above as in @xcite where the case of gauged @xmath2 q - balls was treated , but the exact one , ( equation [ 32 ] ) . let the matter have a spatially constant value @xmath79 within a sphere of radius @xmath80 .",
    "we will use eq .",
    "( 31 ) so as to find @xmath81 .",
    "it is easy to find that : @xmath82 and : @xmath83 where @xmath84}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the gauge field at large distances of the soliton origin has the form of a field generated from a spherically symmetric localized distribution carrying @xmath0 charge , without magnetic fields .",
    "[ 35 ] gives @xmath85 inserting @xmath86 from the above equation in the relations [ 40]-[41 ] and substituting the result in the exact expression of the energy we find : @xmath87g^2{\\mathbf{q}}^2- \\nonumber\\\\ 32[-1+\\exp(2gr\\sigma ) ] { \\pi}^2r^4u+32[1+\\exp(2gr\\sigma)]g{\\pi}^2r^5\\sigma u\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ { \\{24\\pi r[1+gr\\sigma+\\exp(2gr\\sigma)(-1+gr\\sigma)]\\}}^{-1}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression the first term is the energy contribution of the gauge field outside the q - ball .",
    "the other terms give the energy of the interior of the soliton .",
    "we differentiate the above expression with respect to the radius of the configuration and we set the result equal to zero . in order to solve the transcendental equation that we take ,",
    "we expand it in a power series of the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "the equation that we have to solve is : @xmath88 the solution to the equation should also be expanded in a power series of @xmath1 : @xmath89 inserting the above expression into the expression of energy and expanding again the energy with respect to @xmath1 we find @xmath90\\ .\\ ] ]    the limit of the above expression when @xmath91 is what we expect from the global case .",
    "the final step is to minimize the energy with respect to the field @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 be the value of the field minimizing the energy in the global case .",

[ 45 ] ) and the field @xmath56 ( eq . [ 48 ] ) .",
    "the energy seems to be larger than in the global case due to the terms depending on @xmath97 .",
    "there is actually a slight decrease in the energy with the coupling constant .",
    "this result will be verified numerically .",
    "but the energy also depends on the charge .",
    "this total charge , @xmath33 , may be different in the local case from the global one .",
    "intuitively , we expect that this charge ( particle number ) is smaller in the case of the local symmetry due to the electrostatic - type repulsion .",
    "this result will also be verified by numerical analysis .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations of the matter and the gauge field are eqs . [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .",
    "the energy and the soliton charge are given from the equations [ 32 ] and [ 35 ] respectively .",
    "in the global case we put @xmath99 and @xmath100 . the soliton charge is half the energy of the free particles with the same charge if the mass is unity as we have seen .     for three different values of the coupling constant with @xmath101 . ]     for three different values of the coupling constant with @xmath101 . ]     for three different values of the coupling constant with @xmath101 .",

    "the square of the coupling constant takes the values 0 , 0.004 and 0.04 .",
    "the first is the case of the global symmetry .",
    "we see that when @xmath102 approaches the critical ( minimum ) value , @xmath41 , which holds for the thin - wall approximation , the  peak \" of the soliton approaches the @xmath103 value according to eq . [ 101 ] , and the energy and the charge of the soliton increase .",
    "these all agree with the idea that when the frequency approaches the critical , minimum , value , the contribution of the spatial field derivatives to the total soliton energy get smaller and we can talk for a large soliton with large energy contributions from the time dependence and the potential . when @xmath104 the size , energy and charge of the soliton decrease , tending to a flat field configuration covering the whole space with a very small value which corresponds to free particles .",
    "for the above reason the ratio soliton energy per free particles energy approaches unity .",

    "this has some interesting consequences .",
    "the minimum value of the frequency ( @xmath107 ) is now larger than in the case of @xmath101 .",
    "so the ratio of the soliton energy per the energy of the free particles is in general larger than in the case of @xmath101 , because the minimum frequency is the lower limit of the above ratio .    .",

    "this is an expected behavior due to the repulsion between the different parts of the soliton and the main reason for the decrease of the particle number ( i.e. the soliton charge . )",
    "we will now explain the behavior of the soliton energy as a function of the coupling constant .",
    "firstly the energy decreases with respect to the coupling constant due to the decrease of the value of the scalar field .",
    "then , the energy seems to increase slightly due to the increase of the  electrostatic \" energy contribution .",
