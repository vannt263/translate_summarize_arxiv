    "inflation @xcite , a rapid accelerated expanding phase of the universe in its very early stage of evolution , provides a mechanism of generation of tiny density fluctuations over the homogeneous and isotropic background , which later evolve into large scale structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies in the universe .",
    "it also explains the observed nearly scale invariant spectrum of these density fluctuations on superhorizon scales .",
    "parameters , like scalar amplitude , scalar spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio , predicted by inflationary paradigm are being very accurately determined by the high - precision cmbr observations , like wmap and planck .",
    "the recent planck-2015 data predicts the scalar amplitude and the scalar spectral index as @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively at ( @xmath4 cl , plancktt+lowp ) @xcite .",
    "recently bicep2/keck array cmb polarization experiments combined with planck analysis of cmb polarization and temperature data have put a bound on tensor - to - scalar ratio as @xmath5 cl ) @xcite .",
    "planck also confirms that the primordial perturbations , to a good approximation , are indeed gaussian in nature by constraining the primordial non - gaussianity ( ng ) amplitude as @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "there is a plethora of inflationary models which explain the key inflationary parameters like scalar amplitude , scalar spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio as observed in the cmb measurements and also account for the smallness of the non - gaussianity parameter simultaneously .",
    "but it is well known that the simplest single field slow - roll inflation models with quartic @xmath7 and quadratic @xmath8 potentials are ruled out from the observations as they produce large tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , for @xmath11 e - foldings  @xcite .",
    "one novel way of making the quartic potential of inflaton viable is through what is now known as the higgs inflation scenario @xcite , where the inflaton field @xmath12 is non - minimally coupled to the curvature scalar @xmath13 ( coupling term looks like @xmath14 ) .",
    "this gives rise to very small tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "such a model however encounters the problem of unitarity violation in higgs - higgs scattering via graviton exchange at planck energy scales because of very large curvature coupling @xmath17 required to obtain the observed cmb amplitude  @xcite .",
    "starobinsky model of inflation which is @xmath18 correction to einstein gravity is mathematically equivalent to higgs inflation model with quartic potential and therefore it produces the similar small tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath15  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "generalized non - minimally coupled models with coupling term @xmath19 and quantum corrected quartic potential @xmath20 , which are equivalent to power law inflation model @xmath21 , are studied in @xcite which produce large @xmath22 , and thus are disfavored by present status of the cmb data  @xcite . in the context of upcoming experiments like keck / bicep3 and cmbpol , it would be of interest to come up with models which predict @xmath23 close to the current bound of @xmath24 . from the theoretical perspective it would be desirable to examine scenarios where the @xmath7 or @xmath8 potentials , which generically occur in particle physics , are compatible with cmb observations .    in this work we study a two - field inflationary model where the inflaton field @xmath12",
    "is assisted by a dilaton field @xmath25 and has a non - canonical kinetic term due to the presence of a dilaton field .",
    "supergravity theories which are low energy limit of string theory contains several scalar fields which can be of cosmological interest .",
    "the action of the model can be generically written as s & = & 12d^4 x,[action - sigma - einstein2 ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are arbitrary independent parameters .",
    "brans - dicke ( bd ) gravity in einstein frame ( ef ) is a special case where @xmath28 @xcite",
    ". however bd gravity predicts @xmath23 larger than the observed limit , therefore generalization of bd theory is necessary for application to inflation . in this paper",
    "we generalize the bd theory in ef to a two - parameter scalar - tensor theory where we treat @xmath26 and @xmath27 as two independent arbitrary parameters .",
    "addition of one extra parameter allows us to obtain viable inflation with otherwise ruled out quadratic and quartic potentials as we can have tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath23 in the range of interest for forthcoming experiments .    to note",
    ", it was shown by ellis et al .",
    "@xcite that the inflaton field accompanied by a moduli field @xmath29 , which appear in string theories and have a no - scale supergravity form , give a potential for inflation equivalent to the @xmath30 starobinsky model , producing @xmath31 .",
    "we show in this paper that the above mentioned two parameter scalar - tensor theory can be obtained from no - scale supergravity theories  @xcite which now can produce @xmath23 much larger than @xmath32 and thus are observationally falsifiable by future experiments . also in contrast to the supergravity embedding of the starobinsky model , studied in  @xcite , where the imaginary part of the superfield @xmath29 @xmath33 axion @xmath34 decreases rapidly and its real part @xmath33 dilaton @xmath35 drives the inflation , we will see that in our model dilaton - axion pair evolves sufficiently during inflation and the axion acts as the inflaton .",
    "first we look at the background dynamics of our model . starting from the action",
    "( [ action - sigma - einstein2 ] ) , the equations of motion of the fields @xmath12 and @xmath25 and the friedmann equations can be obtained as @xmath36 where an over dot represents derivatives w.r.t .",
    "time and prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath12 . in the slow - roll regime",
    "when both the fields slow - roll , terms with double time derivatives can be neglected and therefore the background equations reduce to @xmath37 here the full potential @xmath38 can be regarded as the product of potentials of the individual fields , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and thus we define the slow - roll parameters for both the fields in a usual way ( following @xcite ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 . to ensure the smallness of the slow - roll parameters we demand that the hubble slow - roll parameter @xmath43 during inflation .",
    "we notice that @xmath44 which implies that @xmath45 and @xmath46 during inflation . again , taking a time - derivative of the second equation of ( [ phidot ] ) to obtain @xmath47 , one obtains @xmath48 , which implies that @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( as @xmath26 is to be taken smaller than unity ) .",
    "we would show later on that the dilaton field @xmath25 evolve slower than the inflaton field @xmath12 throughout the inflationary phase which would enable us to treat @xmath25 as a background field .",
    "furthermore , we would require the initial field values to calculate the inflationary observables such as @xmath51 , @xmath23 and @xmath52 .",
    "from the first equation of ( [ hdot ] ) , we notice that @xmath53 , \\label{phi - evo } % \\phi^2&=&\\phi^2_0+\\frac{16}{\\beta^2}e^{\\frac{\\beta\\sigma_0}{2}}\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{a}{a_0}\\right)^{\\frac{\\beta^2}{2}}\\right ] \\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where subscript @xmath54 indicates the values of the quantities 60 e - foldings prior to end of inflation . defining @xmath55 and requiring @xmath56 ( subscript @xmath57 denoting the quantities at the end of inflation ) for sufficient inflation",

    "it is important to note that in our model the amplitude of the isocurvature perturbations , @xmath84 ^ 2}{e^{(2\\beta-\\gamma)\\sigma}(\\dot\\sigma^{2 } + e^{-\\gamma\\sigma } \\dot\\phi^2)^3 } , \\label{powers}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] vanishes in the slow - roll approximation ( using ( [ phidot ] ) ) .",
    "the multifield models with non - canonical kinetic term posses a strong single - field attractor solution  @xcite as has also been observed in this case .",
    "but generally these multifield models produce isocurvature perturbations which can also account for a large angular scale suppression of the power spectrum .",
    "but our case differs from such multifield models as it does not produce any isocurvature perturbations upto slow - roll approximation .",
    "in our model , we would treat the @xmath12 field as the inflaton field which is assisted by the dilaton field @xmath25 during the inflationary evolution .",
    "this can only be ensured if we confirm that the @xmath25 field evolves slower than the @xmath12 field during the entire inflationary epoch . to show this",

    "also we fix @xmath93 for each case , which is required for the sugra derivation of this model studied in the later part of this paper .",

    "after the end of inflation , inflaton goes to its minimum value @xmath97 . such background evolution of the fields also ensure that the background spatial metric evolves ( quasi-)exponentially during inflation which has been depicted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "also we checked that for the case of quartic potential @xmath98 , the fields evolve in a similar way ensuring that @xmath12 can be treated as an inflaton field .",

    "therefore , in this model with quadratic and quartic potentials , similar to the case of single - field slow - roll inflation , we require light inflaton mass and fine - tuning of the inflaton self - coupling in order to fit the observed cmb amplitude .",
    "however , unlike the higgs inflation which predicts very small @xmath128 and standard single - field inlation with quadratic and quartic potentials give large @xmath23 , the two field model can give @xmath23 close to the present bound @xmath24 .",
    "for the above mentioned initial conditions , coupling constants and parameter values , the running of the spectral index @xmath129 comes out to be @xmath130 and @xmath131 for quadratic and quartic potentials , respectively , fully consistant with the planck observation @xmath132  @xcite .",
    "besides yielding @xmath23 , @xmath51 and @xmath133 within the observational bounds , a viable inflationary model should not produce large non - gaussianity ( ng ) to remain in accordance with observations .",
    "ng in multifield models where the fields have non - canonical kinetic terms has been calculated in ref.s  @xcite .",
    "following these ref.s , we calculated the non - linearity parameter @xmath134 which characterizes the amplitude of ng .",
    "we find that for the range of parameters values as shown in fig .",

    "also we find that @xmath136 does not depend on initial value of the dilaton @xmath105 and coupling constants for the considered chaotic form of potential .",
    "in this section we would show that , such a two - field inflationary model can be realised in the realm of no - scale supergravity .",
    "the two - field models of inflation with string motivated tree - level no - scale khler potential in no - scale supergravity framework are analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the f - term scalar potential in ef is determined from khler function given in terms of khler potential @xmath137 and superpotential @xmath138 as @xmath139 , where @xmath140 are the chiral superfields . in the supergravity action ,",
    "potential and kinetic terms in ef are given by -0.2 cm v = e^g ,   _ k = k_i^j * _ ^i ^^*_j , [ lvlk ] where @xmath141 is the inverse of the khler metric @xmath142 .",
    "we consider the khler potential of the following form k=-3 + , [ kp ] here @xmath29 is the two component chiral superfield whose real part is the dilaton and imaginary part is an axion .",
    "we identify axion as the inflaton of the model , and @xmath143 is an additional matter field with modular weight @xmath144 . in typical orbifold string compactifications with three moduli fields ,",

    ", we assume the superpotential as @xmath147 .",
    "we can decompose @xmath29 field in its real and imaginary parts parametrized by two real fields @xmath25 and @xmath12 , respectively , as @xmath148    the evolution of the matter field @xmath143 is constrained by the exponential factor @xmath149 via @xmath150 in the scalar potential ( [ lvlk ] ) as @xmath151 . since @xmath152 for @xmath153 and @xmath154 during inflation .",
    "therefore field @xmath143 , due to its exponentially steep potential , is rapidly driven to zero at the start of the inflation and stabilizes at @xmath155  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the stabilization of the field @xmath143 for different initial conditions as discussed before for @xmath156 .",
    "we also checked the evolution of @xmath143 for @xmath157 and found that it stabilizes in the similar fashion .",

    "since during inflation , dilaton @xmath25 evolves much slower compared to inflaton @xmath12 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , therefore @xmath160 and hence the first term inside the bracket in ( [ v1 ] ) can be neglected compared to second term .",

    "to summarize , our two - field two - parameter inflationary model , where the inflaton field has a non - canonical kinetic term due to the presence of the dilaton field , renders quartic and quadratic potentials of the inflaton field viable with current observations . unlike higgs - inflationary scenario which predicts very small tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath128",
    ", this model can produce large @xmath23 in the range @xmath168 which would definitely be probed by future @xmath1mode experiments and thus such a model can be put to test with the future observations .",
    "also this model produces no isocurvature perturbations upto slow - roll approximation and predicts negligible non - gaussianity consistent with the observations .",
    "in addition , we showed that this model can be obtained from a no - scale sugra model which makes this model of inflation phenomenologically interesting from the particle physics perspective .",
