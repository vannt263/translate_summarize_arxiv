    "surveys are a critical tool for understanding the evolution of galaxies and agn . because their properties are diverse and changing , we utilize large statistical samples of galaxies to measure the distribution of their properties and to trace the evolution of these distributions . achieving a suitably high level of detail requires a combination of multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy . without a redshift estimate , one can not infer luminosity , color , or environmental density , all quantities known to be of central importance in the behavior of galaxies and agn . while photometric redshifts can be used in the absence of spectroscopy , they have more systematic uncertainties ( e.g. @xcite ) and have difficulty with agn ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the story of galaxy evolution involves many wavelengths of light : uv and far - ir for young stars , optical and near - ir for older stars , and x - ray , radio and mid - ir for nuclear activity .",
    "decades of surveys have quantified the luminosity , color , surface brightness , star formation , and nuclear activity of low redshift galaxies and correlated these properties with environment .",
    "the combination of the cfa redshift survey ( @xcite ) and the palomar sky survey ( poss - ii , @xcite ) defined the state of the art for local galaxies in the 1980 s .",
    "this was followed by the las campanas redshift survey and its drift - scan ccd imaging ( @xcite ) , which expanded our view to larger scales .",
    "most recently , the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss @xcite ) brought the scale of spectroscopy to the million - galaxy level . wide area digital imaging from the 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) , sdss , galex ( @xcite ) , the spitzer space telescope ( @xcite ) , and rosat ( e.g. @xcite ) have been combined with this spectroscopy to build a detailed characterization of nearby galaxies .",
    "surveys at higher redshift require much deeper imaging and fainter spectroscopy .",
    "projects such as goods ( @xcite ) , deep-2 ( e.g. @xcite ) , vvds ( @xcite ) , and cosmos ( @xcite ) now aim to survey cosmologically interesting volumes at redshifts of order unity and above .",
    "importantly , there is substantial evolution in galaxy properties . since @xmath17 ,",
    "the star formation rate per unit comoving volume has dropped by a factor of 10 ( e.g. @xcite ) , the frequency of luminous quasars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies have decreased by a factor of 100 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , the mass of galaxies on the red sequence has roughly doubled ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , and the typical site for star formation has moved to less massive galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . at redshifts above unity , further evolution is clear , with galaxies getting notably smaller ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , possibly with changing correlations of star formation with environment ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "mapping galaxy properties at intermediate redshift ( @xmath18 ) and the demographics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at any redshift requires wider fields than these deep surveys can provide .",
    "we designed the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ) to address these questions , combining spectroscopy from the hectospec instrument on the mmt ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) with superb multi - wavelength imaging in the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) botes field .",
    "this field contains deep imaging at optical and near - ir bands ( @xcite , @xcite ) as well as full - field coverage from spitzer irac ( @xcite and later @xcite ) and mips ( @xcite ) , chandra ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , galex ( @xcite ) , and radio ( @xcite , @xcite ) facilities .",
    "as we detail below , ages provides spectroscopic redshifts for 18163 galaxies to @xmath19 and 4764 agn to @xmath20 in the 9 square degree field .",
    "ages sought to exploit the diversity of available imaging data by a multi - faceted targeting strategy .",
    "agn were selected by optical color , irac color , and mips , x - ray , or radio detection .",
    "the result is a large and broad sample of agn , including nearly 200 per square degree at @xmath21 and nearly 400 per square degree in total .",
    "the galaxy sample required sparse sampling to reach @xmath19 , but we tuned the sparse sampling algorithm to ensure full sampling of brighter magnitude thresholds in ten different bands from the uv to the mid - ir .",
    "the ages observational strategy returned to the field many times with rolling acceptance , with the result of very high completeness in the statistical samples .",
    "this also means that fiber collisions are an unimportant problem even in high density regions .",
    "ages is well tuned for the study of galaxy properties at @xmath22 and agn properties out to @xmath23 over a cosmologically sized volume with pan - chromatic spectral energy distributions .",

    "all magnitudes and fluxes are in the system used by the parent survey .",
    "these are vega magnitudes for the b@xmath24 , r , i , j , k , k@xmath25 and irac bands , ab magnitudes for the fuv , nuv and @xmath26 bands , mjy for mips @xmath7 m band and the radio observations , and @xmath12-@xmath27  kev counts for the x - ray observations .",
    "we selected targets at all wavelengths from radio through x - ray to take full advantage of the available imaging data .",
    "we start with the optical data of the ndwfs itself in the b@xmath2 , r and i bands ( @xcite ) , since our ability to measure spectra is limited by the optical flux .",
    "we used the zbotes ( @xcite ) data to help target high - redshift quasars . in the near - infrared we used the k - band data of the ndwfs and the j / k@xmath25-band data of the flamex survey ( @xcite ) . in the mid - infrared we used the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0@xmath28 m data from the irac shallow survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used the 24@xmath28 m data from @xcite . in the radio",
    "we used the first survey ( @xcite ) and the deeper 1.4  ghz wsrt catalog of @xcite .",
    "going to shorter wavelengths we used data from galex ( @xcite ) in the uv and the chandra xbotes survey ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "our general approach was to produce well - defined , magnitude limited samples of galaxies at all the available wavelengths from 24@xmath28 m through the galex fuv bands , and to target agn using a broad range of selection methods to a somewhat deeper optical flux limit .",
    "the galaxy samples were generally designed to be complete to an intermediate magnitude limit and then randomly sparse sampled from this intermediate limit to the overall magnitude limit .",
    "the sample definitions changed several times , with the largest change being a shift from preliminary photometric catalogs and r - band magnitude limits to revised catalogs and i - band magnitude limits between the 2004 and 2005 observing seasons .",
    "sparse sampling was an essential component of our strategy for studying galaxies because it was the only means of covering such a wide area to the desired depth ( @xmath8  mag ) in reasonable time . to begin with , sparse sampling over a wider area produces samples with less cosmic variance than complete samples in smaller areas surveying smaller cosmological volumes .",
    "it also allows us to sample galaxies with very different properties with a well - defined statistical approach .",
    "in particular , by making the survey complete for bright objects and sparse sampling across many different photometric bands for fainter objects , we have a final sample with less shot noise for bright objects and the relatively rarer objects with extreme colors in any band . while the approach is more complex than previous redshift surveys , it is nonetheless straight forward to construct a complete statistical sample by weighting each object by the inverse of its sampling fraction we provide explicit instructions on the appropriate procedures in  [ sec : release ] .    in  2.1 , 2.2 and 2.3",
    "we define nomenclature , outline our approach to random sparse sampling , and define the standard ages sub - fields . in  2.4 , 2.5 , and 2.6 we outline the sample definitions used in 2004 , 2005 and 2006/2007 .",
    "samples defined in the previous years continued to be observed at the same priorities in the later years .",
    "the biggest differences were between 2004 and the later years , where we ( 1 ) shifted from an r - band limited sample in 2004 to an i - band limited sample , ( 2 ) shifted from preliminary ndwfs and irac shallow survey catalogs to later versions , and ( 3 ) added mid - ir quasar selection . the main differences from 2005 to 2006/2007 were to add sub - samples further exploring mid - ir quasar selection and to include the zbotes data as a tool for agn selection .",
    "there are many other small differences that are detailed in each subsection .",
    "we provide the selection codes for all seasons , so that it is clear why any source may have been targeted , but in the data tables we only provide the photometric information for the updated catalogs used from 2005 onwards .",
    "the photometric data are only a limited representation of the underlying catalogs ",

    "for many of our samples we observed all targets to an intermediate magnitude limit and then randomly sparse sampled the sources between the intermediate limit and the overall flux limit of the sample .",

    "first , all three of the fields have more targets ( 786 , 748 and 855 respectively ) than the mean ( 734 per field ) , although we achieved much higher completenesses for other dense fields such as field 4 .",
    "second , we emphasized completing the lower field numbers in the face of poor weather and limited time to finish our observations .",

    "the primary difference between the x - ray ( and radio ) sample versus the irac and mips samples is that x - ray selection is essentially independent of host properties while the irac and mips samples are not .",
    "thus , lower redshift agn are more likely to be x - ray selected because the generally larger contribution of the host galaxy at lower redshifts changes the mid - ir colors or makes the optical counterpart to the mips source non - point - like . on the other hand ,",
    "the mid - ir selection methods may well be better for finding moderately obscured quasars where the soft x - ray photons to which chandra is most sensitive are absorbed .",

    "there are very few spurious objects .",
    "only 1% of the main - sample galaxies lack counterparts in sdss imaging , although some saturated stars were mis - identified as galaxy targets .",

    "in summary , the agn and galaxy evolution survey has measured approximately 23745 redshifts in the botes field of the ndwfs using a layered approach to target selection that produced well - defined samples of galaxies and agn over a broad wavelength range .",

    "@xcite used it to explore the origin of @xmath7 m emission in otherwise early - type galaxies , and @xcite used it to study the evolution of the uv upturn in early - type galaxies .",
    "the initial ages data were used to develop a remarkably successful mid - ir approach to quasar selection by @xcite .",
    "this approach was then used in the later years not only to build the largest existing sample of mid - ir - selected agn , but also to explore its properties and limitations in detail both through other ages mid - ir target samples ( @xcite , @xcite ) and comparisons with x - ray sources ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite use the ages data to explore the relationships between agn accretion and galaxy properties and clustering , while @xcite examined the eddington ratio distribution of quasars to find that the distributions were surprisingly narrow .",
