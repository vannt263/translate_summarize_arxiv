    "u scorpii is one of the best observed recurrent novae , the outbursts of which were recorded in 1863 , 1906 , 1936 , 1979 , 1987 , and the latest in 1999 .",
    "especially , the 1999 outburst was well observed from the rising phase to the cooling phase by many observers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) including eclipses ( matsumoto , kato , & hachisu 2000 ) . based on matsumoto et al.s ( 2000 )",
    "observation , hachisu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have constructed a theoretical light - curve model for the 1999 outburst of u sco and obtained various physical parameters of the recurrent nova .",
    "their main results are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) a direct light - curve fitting of the 1999 outburst indicates a very massive white dwarf ( wd ) of @xmath14 .",
    "( 2 ) the envelope mass at the optical maximum is estimated to be @xmath15 .",
    "( 3 ) therefore , the mass accretion rate of the wd is @xmath16 yr@xmath8 during the quiescent phase between 1987 and 1999 .",
    "( 4 ) an optically thick wind blows from the wd and plays a key role in determining the nova duration because it reduces the envelope mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "about 60% of the envelope mass is carried away in the wind , which forms an expanding shell as observed in t pyx ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the residual 40% ( @xmath17 ) is added to the helium layer of the wd .",
    "( 5 ) as a result , the wd can grow in mass at an average rate of @xmath18 yr@xmath8 .",
    "the above physical pictures are exactly the same as proposed by hachisu et al .",
    "( 1999b ) as a progenitor system of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "however , the distance to u sco is still controversial because the direct light - curve fitting results in a relatively short distance of @xmath19 kpc ( @xcite ) , which is incompatible with the distance of @xmath20 kpc at the quiescent phase ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , for a summary ) .",
    "if the distance of @xmath20 kpc is the case , it could be hardly consistent with the results ( 1 ) to ( 5 ) mentioned above .",
    "our purpose in this letter is to construct a light - curve model for the quiescent phase and to rectify the distance to u sco .",
    "our numerical method to obtain light curves has been described both in hachisu & kato ( 1999 ) to explain the second peak of t crb outbursts and in hachisu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to reproduce the light curve for the 1999 outburst of u sco .",
    "therefore , we mention only new parts of our numerical method in  2 . in  3 , by directly fitting our theoretical light curve to the observations , we derive the distance to u sco .",
    "discussions follow in  4 , especially in relation to the recently detected orbital - period change of u sco and a systemic mass loss through the outer lagrangian points .",
    "we also discuss the relation to a progenitor system of sne ia .",
    "our u sco model is graphically shown in figure [ uscofig_q35 ] .",
    "schaefer ( 1990 ) and schaefer & ringwald ( 1995 ) observed eclipses of u sco in the quiescent phase and determined the orbital period ( @xmath21 days ) and the ephemeris ( hjd 2,451,235.777 @xmath4 1.23056@xmath22 ) at the epoch of mid - eclipse .",
    "thus , the companion is a main - sequence star ( ms ) which expands to fill its roche lobe after a most part of the central hydrogen is consumed .",
    "we call such a star `` a slightly evolved '' ms .",
    "the inclination angle of the orbit ( @xmath23 ) is a parameter for fitting .",
    "we have assumed that ( 1 ) @xmath24 , ( 2 ) the wd luminosity of @xmath25 where the first term is the accretion luminosity ( e.g. , starrfield , sparks , & shaviv 1988 ) and the second term @xmath26 is the intrinsic luminosity of the wd , and @xmath27 the radius of the @xmath28 wd , and ( 3 ) a black - body photosphere of the wd .",
    "the accretion luminosity is @xmath29 for a suggested mass accretion rate of @xmath16 yr@xmath8 . here",
    ", we assume @xmath30 because the nuclear luminosity is smaller than the accretion luminosity for this accretion rate , but we have examined other two cases of @xmath31 and 4000 @xmath32 and found no significant differences in the distance as shown below .",
    "we do not consider the limb - darkening effect for simplicity .",
    "it is assumed that the companion star is synchronously rotating on a circular orbit and its surface fills the inner critical roche lobe as shown in figure [ uscofig_q35 ] .",
    "we neglect both the limb - darkening effect and the gravity - darkening effect of the companion star for simplicity . here",
    ", we assume a 50% irradiation efficiency of the companion star ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we have examined the dependence of the distance on the irradiation efficiency ( i.e. , @xmath34 and 1.0 ) but found no significant differences in the distance as shown below .",
    "the non - irradiated photospheric temperature @xmath35 of the companion star is a parameter for fitting .",
    "the mass of the secondary is assumed to be @xmath36 .",
    "the size of the accretion disk is a parameter for fitting and defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a numerical factor indicating the size of the accretion disk , and @xmath39 the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe for the wd component ( e.g. , eggleton 1983 ) .",
    "we also assume that the accretion disk is axisymmetric and has a thickness given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the height of the surface from the equatorial plane , @xmath42 the distance on the equatorial plane from the center of the wd , @xmath43 the power of the surface shape , and @xmath44 a numerical factor showing the degree of thickness and also a parameter for fitting .",
    "we adopt a @xmath42-squared law ( @xmath45 ) simply to mimic the flaring - up effect of the accretion disk rim ( e.g. , schandl , meyer - hofmeister , & meyer 1997 ) , and have examined the dependence of the distance on the power ( @xmath46 and 3.0 ) without finding any significant differences as shown below .",
    "the surface of the accretion disk also absorbs photons from the wd photosphere and reemits with a black - body spectrum at a local temperature .",
    "we assume a 50% irradiation efficiency of the companion star , i.e. , @xmath47 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have examined other two cases of @xmath48 and 1.0 , and found no significant differences in the distance as shown below .",
    "the non - irradiated temperature of the disk surface is assumed to be determined by the viscous heating of the standard accretion disk model .",
    "then , the disk surface temperature is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 the distance from the wd center , and @xmath51 the incident angle of the surface ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature of the disk rim is assumed to be 3000 k.",
    "figure [ bmag_bv_color_paper ] shows the observational points ( open circles ) by schaefer ( 1990 ) together with our calculated @xmath2 light curve ( thick solid line ) for @xmath52 yr@xmath8 . to fit our theoretical light curves with the observational points ,",
    "we calculate @xmath2 light curves by changing the parameters of @xmath531.0 by 0.1 step , @xmath540.50 by 0.05 step , @xmath558000 k by 100 k step , and @xmath56@xmath57 by @xmath58 step and seek for the best fit model .",
    "the best fit parameters obtained are shown in figure [ bmag_bv_color_paper ] ( see also table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "there are five different contributions to the @xmath2-light ( @xmath59 ) in the system : the white dwarf ( @xmath60 ) , the non - irradiated portions of the accretion disk ( @xmath61 ) and the donor star ( @xmath62 ) , and the irradiated portions of the accretion disk ( @xmath63 ) and the donor star ( @xmath64 ) . in order to show each contribution ,",
    "we have added two light curves in figure [ bmag_bv_color_paper ] , that is , a non - irradiation case of the acdk ( @xmath65 , dash - dotted ) , and a non - irradiation case of the ms ( @xmath66 , dashed ) .",
    "the light from the wd is completely blocked by the accretion disk rim , thus having no contribution , @xmath67 .",
    "the depth of the primary eclipse , 1.5 mag , means @xmath68 because the acdk is completely occulted by the ms .",
    "the difference of 1 mag between the thick solid and dash - dotted lines indicates @xmath69 .",
    "the difference of 0.1 mag between the thick solid and dashed lines indicates @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we obtain each contribution : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "then we calculate the theoretical color index @xmath76 for these best fit models . here",
    ", we explain only the case of @xmath52 yr@xmath8 . by fitting",
    ", we obtain the apparent distance modulus of @xmath77 , which corresponds to the distance of @xmath78 kpc without absorption ( @xmath79 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we obtained a rather blue color index of @xmath80 outside eclipses . together with the observed color of @xmath81 outside",
    "eclipses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we derive a color excess of @xmath82 here , suffixes @xmath83 and @xmath84 represent the theoretically calculated and the observational values , respectively .",
    "then , we expect an absorption of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we are forced to have a rather short distance to u sco of 7.5 kpc .    in our case of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the accretion disk is completely occulted at mid - eclipse .",
    "the color index of @xmath89 at mid - eclipse indicates a spectral type of f8 for the cool component ms , which is in good agreement with the spectral type of f8@xmath902 suggested by johnston & kulkarni ( 1992 ) .",
    "hanes ( 1985 ) also suggested that a spectral type nearer f7 is preferred .    for other mass accretion rates of @xmath91 ( 0.15.0)@xmath92 yr@xmath8",
    ", we obtain similar short distances to u sco , as summarized in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "it should be noted that , although the luminosity of the model depends on our various assumptions of the irradiation efficiencies , the @xmath42-powered law of the disk , and the intrinsic luminosity of the wd , the derived distance to u sco itself is almost independent of these assumptions , as seen from table [ tbl-2 ] . therefore , the relatively short distance to u sco ( @xmath93 68 kpc ) is a rather robust conclusion , at least , from the theoretical point of view .",
    "matsumoto et al . ( 2000 ) observed a few eclipses during the 1999 outburst and , for the first time , detected a significant period - change of @xmath94 yr@xmath8 .",
    "if we assume the conservative mass transfer , this period change requires a mass transfer rate of @xmath95 yr@xmath8 in quiescence .",
    "such a mass transfer for 12 years is too high to be compatible with the envelope mass on the white dwarf , thus implying a non - conservative mass transfer in u sco .",
    "we have estimated the mass transfer rate for a non - conservative case by assuming that matter is escaping from the outer lagrangian points and thus the specific angular momentum of the escaping matter is @xmath96 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , where @xmath97 is the separation and @xmath98",
    ". then the mass transfer rate from the companion is @xmath99 yr@xmath8 for @xmath1002.0 @xmath3 under the assumption that the wd receives matter at a rate of @xmath101 yr@xmath8 .",
    "the residual ( @xmath13 yr@xmath8 ) , which is escaping from the system , forms an excretion disk outside the orbit of the binary .",
    "such an extended excretion disk / torus may cause a large color excess of @xmath102 .",
    "kahabka et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported the hydrogen column density of ( 3.14.8)@xmath103 @xmath104 , which is much larger than the galactic absorption in the direction of u sco ( 1.4@xmath103 @xmath104 , @xcite ) , indicating a substantial intrinsic absorption .",
    "it should also be noted here that barlow et al .",
    "( 1981 ) estimated the absorption toward u sco by three ways : ( 1 ) the galactic absorption in the direction of u sco , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , ( 2 ) the line ratio of he  ii during the 1979 outburst ( @xmath107 12 days after maximum ) , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and ( 3 ) the balmer line ratio during the 1979 outburst ( @xmath107 3334 days after maximum ) , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . the last one is significantly larger than the other two estimates .",
    "they suggested the breakdown of their case b approximation in high density regions .",
    "however , we may point out another possibility that the systemic mass outflow from the binary system has already begun at @xmath107 33 days and , as a result , an intrinsic absorption is gradually increasing .    the mass of the companion star can be constrained from the mass transfer rate .",
    "such a high transfer rate as @xmath112 yr@xmath8 strongly indicates a thermally unstable mass transfer ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is realized when the mass ratio is larger than 1.01.1 , i.e. , @xmath113 1.01.1 for zero - age main - sequence stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "this may pose a requirement @xmath114 .",
    "we estimate the most likely companion mass of 1.41.6 @xmath3 from equation ( 11 ) in hachisu et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "if the distance to u sco is @xmath93 6.08.0 kpc , it is located @xmath93 2.33.0 kpc above the galactic plane ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the zero - age masses of the progenitor system to u sco are rather massive ( e.g. , @xmath116 from hachisu et al .",
    "1999b ) and it is unlikely that such massive stars were born in the halo .",
    "some normal b - type main - sequence stars have been found in the halo ( e.g. , pg0009 + 036 is located @xmath93 5 kpc below the galactic disk , @xcite ) , which were ejected from the galactic disk because of their relatively high moving velocities @xmath93100200 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the radial velocity of u sco is not known but it is suggested that the @xmath117-velocity is @xmath9350100 km s@xmath8 from the absorption line velocities ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if so , it seems likely that u sco was ejected from the galactic disk with a vertical velocity faster than @xmath118 km s@xmath8 and has reached at the present place within the main - sequence lifetimes of a @xmath119 star ( @xmath120 yr ) .",
    "now , we can understand the current evolutionary status and a further evolution of u sco system .",
    "the white dwarf has a mass @xmath121 .",
    "it is very likely that the wd has reached such a large mass by mass accretion .",
    "in fact the wd is currently increasing the mass of the helium layer at a rate of @xmath122 yr@xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then predict that the wd will evolve as follows .",
    "when the mass of the helium layer reaches a critical mass after many cycles of recurrent nova outbursts , a helium shell flash will occur .",
    "its strength is as weak as those of agb stars because of the high mass accretion rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "a part of the helium layer will be blown off in the wind , but virtually all of the helium layer will be burnt into carbon - oxygen and accumulates in the white dwarf ( @xcite ) . therefore , the wd mass can grow until an sn ia explosion is triggered ( @xcite ) .",
