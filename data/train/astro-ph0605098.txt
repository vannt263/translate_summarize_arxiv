    "whether the milky way dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellite galaxies are undergoing tidal disruption remains a controversial question .",
    "such tidal disruption would naturally lead to extended populations of stars that have been stripped from the satellite core .",
    "that _ most _ of the milky way ( mw ) dwarf spheroidals exhibit radial density profiles with extended components was suggested by the large area photographic survey of most of the galactic dsph satellites by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ih95 ) .",
    "a number of studies have addressed the question of the reality of extended structural components around individual dsph examples  among them the carina dsph , for which the issue has prompted lively debate ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in a recent review of past and new work on the carina system , (",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper vi ) attempted to resolve the previous , apparently discordant results regarding the photometric detection of an extended carina structural component .",
    "paper vi showed that of all previous photometric surveys of carina , that of @xcite  which makes use of the @xmath12washington @xmath13 filter technique to identify giant stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) ) at the distance of the carina system  achieves the highest , and therefore most reliable , signal - to - background contrast in the diffuse outer parts of the carina system .",
    "moreover an extended , power - law component detected around carina in @xcite is supported by spectroscopic confirmation of carina giant candidates to 1.4 times the nominal limiting radius ( @xmath2 ) of the central - fitted king profile in paper vi .",
    "our previous work has therefore established the likely reality of the  king + power law \" density profile for the carina dsph .    in this paper (  3 )",
    "we take advantage of a similar , but deeper and much wider area , photometric database of carina than that presented in @xcite and , in addition , contribute higher - quality radial velocities ( rvs ) of carina stars from echelle spectroscopy of giant star candidates to more than three times the angular separation from the carina center than we explored in @xcite .",
    "carina - associated stars are now established to @xmath14 from the carina core , leaving no doubt as to the reality of an extended component to the carina system and imposing extreme limits on the mass of carina if these stars are bound to the dsph (  4.6 ) . to further improve the kinematical mapping of the carina system at smaller radii",
    ", we also take advantage of archived , publicly available vlt+giraffe spectra of more than 1000 stars near the center of carina , which contribute more than 300 additional rvs of carina - related stars within the king limiting radius .",
    "the resulting velocity dispersion profile of the carina system is the most extensive yet determined for any dsph galaxy , yet shows a continuation to large radii of the same more or less flat trend found ( to smaller radii ) in other galactic dsphs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the present photometric and spectroscopic database of stars in the direction of carina has yielded the additional discovery of a second apparently coherent stellar population in the foreground of the dsph (  6 ) .",
    "this other milky way substructure is as dynamically cold as the carina system itself and , ironically , represents the primary source of contamination within our previous ( @xcite ) and present photometric samples of carina stars outside @xmath2 .",
    "the fifteen stars in our mike sample that are part of this other substructure share a number of properties ( color - magnitude diagram position , metallicity , and velocity - angular separation trend ) with stars of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , but stretch some 22@xmath11 from the lmc center . as with carina",
    ", these widely separated stars place new , very large lower limits on the lmc mass and tidal radius if the stars are bound to their parent satellite .",
    "through spectroscopic follow - up of stars in the @xcite carina database , @xcite demonstrated the efficacy of washington @xmath0 photometry to produce high quality candidate lists of giant stars from the carina system to large separations from the core , and dispelled concerns ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that there may have been problems with the original methods or findings of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a deeper , more uniform , and larger area @xmath0 survey of the carina system was desired : @xcite ( see  2.4 of that paper ) showed how the results of a survey with better photometry would improve the carina giant candidate selection , whereas surveying to a larger angular radius would give greater insight into the extent and character of this outer carina population .",
    "thus , new carina photometry over a 10.74 deg@xmath1 area ( 9.3 times more area than covered in @xcite  the area outlined below in fig .",
    "1 ) centered on the carina dsph was obtained with the mosaic wide - field imaging camera on the blanco telescope on ut 2000 feb 24 - 27 under photometric conditions . daophot",
    "ii / allstar ( @xcite ) psf - fitting photometry was derived for stars in each of the individual mosaic pointings , producing magnitudes with median errors of @xmath15 ( 0.018 , 0.020 , 0.015 ) at @xmath16 , which is approximately 3.4 mag below the carina red giant branch ( rgb ) tip ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the photometry of this new survey is about 2 times more precise at that magnitude than the carina data presented in @xcite .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were calibrated into the standard system via multiple observations of washington@xmath17 standards in @xcite . each star in our catalog",
    "has been corrected for reddening based on its galactic coordinates by using the reddening map constructed by @xcite .",
    "we found an @xmath18 range of 0.0330.102 in our carina fields .",
    "as in @xcite , the dereddened @xmath19 two - color diagram ( 2cd ) and the @xmath20 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) are used together to select stars most likely to be carina giant stars .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the selection criteria we used to identify carina rgb stars :  carina giant star candidates \" are expected to fall primarily within the regions bounded by the solid lines in each of the diagrams in figure 3 . because we want to create the most reliable maps of carina density possible and because we choose to reserve the valuable magellan echelle spectroscopic follow - up (  3 ) observing for the very best photometrically - selected candidates , our initial selection criteria were deliberately conservative .",
    "for example , we did _ not _ employ the proposed wider cmd selection criteria discussed in  3.2 of @xcite , but maintained the more restrictive limits used in @xcite . in addition , our 2cd giant selection boundary is set far from the dwarf star locus to minimize photometric contamination ( fig .",
    "3b ) of the giant sample .",
    "however , the extensive , archived vlt+giraffe spectroscopic data set for the carina field , obtained for dsph candidates selected independently of our photometry and methodology , allows us in the velocity analysis described later (  4 ) to search for additional carina stars with measured rvs that , while being excluded from our conservatively made  best `` candidate lists , still occupy ' ' rgb - like \" regions of the cmd and 2cd (  4.1.3 ) .    across our survey area",
    ", the photometric sample is expected to be complete to @xmath16 , so we analyze the spatial distribution of giant candidates to this magnitude limit .",
    "in addition , because our spectroscopic survey is almost complete outside the carina @xmath2 to @xmath21 , we also analyze the spatial distribution of giants using this magnitude limit .",
    "figure 4 presents the radial density profile derived for the carina dsph for these two adopted magnitude limits . to create this profile",
    ", stars have been binned into elliptically - shaped annuli matching the carina center , ellipticity and position angle found by @xcite .    as discussed at length in @xcite and @xcite , proper assessment of the background level",
    "( i.e. density of false positive detections ) is critical to deriving dsph radial density profiles .",
    "here we adopt two strategies for assessing this backgound level . in the case of the @xmath22-limited density profile , we can",
    "very accurately estimate the background directly from the results of our spectroscopic survey (  4 ) , which is 90% complete for stars beyond the @xcite carina @xmath2 .",
    "this spectroscopically - verified , true background of 2.3 deg@xmath23 within our  carina giant candidate \" star sample is subtracted from the observed density distribution of @xmath24 carina dsph giant candidates across the entire survey to reveal the density profile shown in figure 4a .",
    "because of our near spectroscopic completeness for these stars , the density profile shown in figure 4a beyond the @xcite @xmath2 virtually reflects the exact distribution of all rv - verified members there .    for our @xmath25 sample , the background is estimated using the  cmd - shifting \" method used in @xcite to estimate a background rate , with the one important difference that with our new survey here we are able to make exclusive use of the vast area outside of the carina king limiting radius to significantly reduce potential contribution of any carina stars not lying on the carina rgb ( e.g. , asymptotic and post - asymptotic giant branch stars ) that may have artificially inflated the estimated backgrounds in the @xcite execution of this method .",
    "on the other hand , we acknowledge that this method may also underestimate the contribution of the newly discovered halo substructure discussed in  6 , since it has a similar cmd position as the carina dsph . to correct for this ,",
    "we add back into our background estimate the fractional contribution of stars from this substructure among the spectroscopic sample of @xmath26 stars chosen as carina giant candidates .",
    "this yields a conservative background level of 10.3 deg@xmath23 , which is then subtracted from the observed density distribution of @xmath25 carina rgb candidates .",
    "the two samples with the two methods of background calculation produce remarkably consistent radial profiles ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the central part of the density profile is well described by the normalized @xcite king profile ( shown by the solid line ) for carina , which is characterized by @xmath27 arcmin and a core radius of 8.8 arcmin .",
    "both radial distributions also show a prominent , second  break population \" roughly following a power - law decline to the limits of our present survey .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to power - law indices of -1.5 , -2 and -2.5 respectively .",
    "a -2 index power law appears to yield a reasonable match to the density fall - off of the break population , although power laws with indices of -1.5 or -2.5 can not be discounted ; in general , the power law here is steeper than found in @xcite , owing to a slightly higher background derived in this study ( see also a discussion of this steeper slope in @xcite ) . nevertheless , in this completely new photometric survey with substantial spectroscopic",
    "follow - up we have independently borne out the general conclusion of @xcite and paper vi that carina exhibits a prominent , extended , power - law break population .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the density profile exhibited in figure 4 mimics that of model disrupting dsph galaxies ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "15 of @xcite ) . with our updated version of the carina density profile",
    ", we can revisit the implied fractional mass loss rate according to the method of @xcite under the assumption that the power law population represents unbound tidal debris .",
    "we derive a fractional mass loss rate for carina of @xmath28=0.075 gyr@xmath9 , but we must note that this method is technically derived for break populations following a -1 power law , and even in that case it only yields estimates good to within a factor of two .",
    "perhaps a better estimate of the fractional mass loss rate comes from the @xmath29 method of @xcite using the corrections given by @xcite ; this method yields un upper limit for the carina mass loss rate of @xmath30 gyr@xmath9 . in a subsequent paper ( muoz et al .",
    ", in preparation , hereafter m06 ) we use this newly derived density profile as well as the velocity dispersion profile derived in  4.3 to model the mass loss history using n - body simulations specific to the carina dsph , and derive likely mass loss rates generally between these two estimates .",
    "the carina power - law population has been of particular , though not exclusive , interest during our follow - up spectroscopic observations .",
    "@xcite presented radial velocity observations obtained with the blanco telescope + hydra multifiber system . only some of these observations were of sufficient resolution to contribute reliable information on the internal dynamics of ( rather than simply stellar membership in ) the carina dsph .",
    "thus , on ut 2004 jan 27 - 28 and dec 29 - 30 good spectra of a total of 77 carina giant star candidates selected from the new photometric survey were obtained using the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph on the clay 6.5-m telescope at las campanas ; this instrument delivers @xmath31 resolution spectra over the red echelle orders we used for this work . of the 77 stars targeted ,",
    "65 were selected to be giant candidates by the giant selection shown by the solid lines in figure 3 and 12 were selected using an expanded 2cd selection ( shown by the dotted lines in the same figure ) .",
    "this wider 2cd giant selection corresponds to that derived in @xcite .",
    "more than half ( 40 ) of the 77 stars observed with mike lie outside the nominal carina @xmath2 as determined by @xcite ; the rest are scattered throughout the region inside the king limiting radius , but primarily at larger radii where few previous carina spectra have been obtained .    radial velocities ( rvs ) have been derived via cross - correlation of the mike spectra against a  universal template \" containing sets of stellar atmospheric absorption lines that typically give the strongest correlations to the spectra of late type stars ; apart from these lines , the bulk of the spectra and templates are masked out because these wavelengths contribute more noise than signal to the cross - correlation spectrum .",
    "prior to cross - correlation , the spectra are also fourier - filtered to remove irrelevant low frequency features as well as features with higher frequency than the intrinsic resolution of the spectrograph . a fuller discussion of this cross - correlation technique is given in @xcite",
    "; but we have found that the procedure works just as well , or even better , for @xmath32 spectra than for the moderate resolution spectra cross - correlated in that paper .",
    "we observed to high @xmath33 a number of k giant velocity standard stars that we used to measure small systematic offsets imposed on the derived rvs that are particular to the nature of the adopted artificial template .",
    "our cross - correlations here were conducted over the echelle order ( spanning 8468 - 8693   ) that contains the calcium infrared triplet and over a dozen other useful lines in stars as metal poor as carina ( [ fe / h ] @xmath34 ) .",
    "tests with other , nearby orders yield similar rv results but of lower reliability , so the values given here are based solely on the calcium triplet order , where the typical @xmath33 of the stellar continua were 7 - 12 per pixel .",
    "this particular echelle order also contains ample numbers of telluric absorption features with strengths great enough to yield useful velocities . since the stars were observed with a 0.9 arcsec slit whereas the seeing often was as good as 0.7 arcsec , significant fractional errors in derived rvs may arise from slit centering errors . to measure the velocity shifts that result from this effect",
    ", we independently cross - correlate the telluric absorption features in each order against those in a set of observed rv standards as well as in dusk spectra ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "these rv standards were typically exposed by smoothly passing them across the slit during the integration to create a symmetric net slit function for the resulting spectra . by comparison of multiple spectra obtained of several carina giants as well as by comparison of results from cross - correlation of different echelle orders",
    ", we find the random errors in the derived rvs to be better than 1.0 km s@xmath9 for the january run and 2.5 km s@xmath9 for the december run .",
    "the degradation in the second run was due to significantly worse overall observing conditions that resulted in poorer @xmath33 spectra on average .",
    "table 1 gives for the stars observed with mike the j2000.0 positions , date of spectroscopic observation , photometric data , rvs in both the heliocentric and galactic standard of rest ( @xmath35 ) conventions , as well as a parameter that characterizes the quality of the rv : an overall quality index , @xmath36 , which ranges from 1 ( lowest quality ) to 7 ( highest quality ) .",
    "the precise meaning of the various @xmath36 grades is explained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as an additional check on the rvs , we independently derived rvs for all mike spectra using the fxcor package from iraf following the method described in @xcite .",
    "the mean rv difference between both methods is @xmath37 km s@xmath9 with a dispersion of @xmath38 km s@xmath9 showing a very close correspondence between the methods .",
    "however , for some spectra with very low @xmath33 our standard methodology failed to yield an acceptable ( i.e. @xmath39 ) cross - correlation , whereas fxcor yielded a cross - correlation with higher apparent reliability . in these cases",
    "we have adopted the fxcor rv in table 1 and given the derived velocity error in place of the @xmath36 value .    in the end ,",
    "all 65 carina - giant candidates observed with mike have a reliable velocity and these form the basis of most of the outer carina rv analyses below . among the 12 stars with rvs selected from the expanded giant selection criterion in figure 3b ,",
    "none have been found to have a carina - like velocity ; however , two of these stars have velocites near @xmath40 km s@xmath9 and constitute members of the newly discovered halo substructure discussed in  6 .",
    "thus we include these two stars in our discussions relevant to this halo substructure .",
    "because our mike observing focused primarily on the most widely separated carina giant candidates , our resulting spectroscopic coverage leaves a significant statistical gap from the only other previously published echelle resolution carina rvs , which are in the carina core ( @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , there exists a substantial collection of archived vlt / flames observations of the carina system that bridges the gap .",
    "these data were retrieved and reduced to rvs by s.z . and d.c ..    flames is installed at the nasmyth a focus of the vlt kueyen telescope and is composed of a fiber positioner , ozpoz , that feeds the dedicated medium - high resolution giraffe ( resolving power @xmath41 ) and uves ( @xmath42 ) spectrographs with 132 and 8 science fibers , respectively , over a large field of view ( @xmath43  arcmin in diameter ) in the  medusa \" mode .",
    "the vlt carina data set used in this paper was collected over a 9 night run at the end of 2003 ( 22 - 31 december ) and consists of 16 different pointings , each observed four times . the exposure time was @xmath44 seconds per pointing .",
    "the four exposures for each pointing were taken in sequence and with the same medusa plate configuration .",
    "all observations were done using giraffe in the low resolution , lr08 set - up having @xmath45 , and centered on the calcium infrared triplet to cover the region from 8206 to 9400   . at the end of each observing night , during daylight , a sample of calibration frames were taken by the vlt staff within the nominal vlt calibration plan .",
    "spectroscopic calibration and extraction have been performed with the giraffe bldrs data reduction pipeline ( version 1.12 ) and the gircalib calibration reference file database ( version 2.3 ) .",
    "the gircalib image database contains generic reference solutions for the calibration frames ( bias and dark frames , flat - fields , fiber slit geometry and fiber response correction frames as well as wavelength calibration for all the different flames observing modes ) that are used as initial guesses for specific night - to - night solutions for all the different calibration steps . for each night",
    ", the calibration frames ( bias , flats , wavelength calibrations ) are grouped together and reduced with the appropriate recipe , starting with the reference solution in the gircalib database and then iterating corrections to it .",
    "once all of the solutions are found they are applied with a single command to the science images .",
    "no particular problems were encountered in the reduction of the calibration frames , but occasionally the wavelength calibration gave unstable and distorted solutions due to the uneven spacing and scarce number of thar calibration lines in the available spectral range . to overcome and check this problem , for each wavelength calibration frame used ( one per night taken during the daytime ) the emission line detection threshold and fitted polynomial order were readjusted until a satisfactory solution was obtained .",
    "these solutions were then verified directly by the thar - calibrated science spectra ( before night sky subtraction ) , which were cross - correlated with a separate , emission line night sky spectrum calibrated externally with the detailed night sky line lists of @xcite .",
    "it was found that the average rms velocity scatter from fiber to fiber based on the sky - lines was an acceptable @xmath46  km s@xmath9 .",
    "we adopt this value as our wavelength zero point error for the giraffe spectra .",
    "the same test revealed that the offset from plate to plate was less than @xmath47  km / s ; nevertheless , we corrected all plates to the same radial velocity zero point system based on the night sky lines .",
    "the archived giraffe images contain spectra from all of the fibers for a given medusa plate . between 109 and 112 medusa fibers",
    "were placed on target stars depending on the pointing , with the remaining fibers positioned on empty sky positions .",
    "the identification of the target objects associated with each spectra is possible using associated archived tables containing the observers input values of target positions and magnitudes as well as details of the positioning of the fiber on the sky .",
    "radial velocity derivations were performed using an implementation of the tonry and davis ( 1979 ) method in the midas environment .",
    "we extracted radial velocities both for each single exposure of each medusa plate and then for the sum of the four exposures per plate . for each exposure we first extracted the sky fibers to create a sky spectrum for that exposure .",
    "this sky spectrum was subtracted from each target fiber spectrum and the result was continuum - normalized and finally cross - correlated with a synthetic spectrum , log@xmath48 and [ fe / h]@xmath49 .",
    "] of a low metallicity giant star to obtain the radial velocity .",
    "in the second reduction method we summed the four extracted and sky - subtracted spectra for each star and cross - correlated _ that _ with the template spectrum .",
    "the comparison of the single spectra and the summed spectra rvs for each object revealed that the rvs from the former were very poor , especially for the faintest stars : several times we failed completely to measure a reliable rv . in the cases where we were able to get four independent rvs we compared their average with the rv of the summed spectrum and found that the rms was much larger than the measurement error in 80% of the sample .",
    "thus , we decided to use only the rvs derived from the summed spectra .",
    "a total of 1771 independent radial velocity measurements were obtained across the sixteen medusa pointings . after removing 66 stars for which we could not get an rv and accounting for repeated targeting of some stars ,",
    "rvs were obtained for 994 distinct stars . in the final definition of the rvs we found that among objects having more than three measurements ( @xmath50 stars ) the scatter was always compatible with the measurements errors except for the very faintest objects where we found a larger scatter .",
    "the rv errors take into account this larger scatter . of the 994 individual giraffe target stars ,",
    "975 were found in our washington+@xmath51 photometric catalog .",
    "we only consider those 975 in our analysis because the remaining 19 stars not present in our photometric catalogues can not be checked for their giant status in the 2cd .",
    ", visible in figure 1 .",
    "we note that only 10 of these 19 stars have rvs consistent with the carina dsph . ]",
    "table 2 presents the rv information for these stars .    to the mike and giraffe data we also add blanco+hydra rvs for photometrically selected giant stars from @xcite that were observed at @xmath52 resolution in october 2001 .",
    "we include these hydra rvs only for those stars not already having higher resolution echelle observations . in the end ,",
    "our sample includes a total of 1123 rvs from table 1 , table 2 , @xcite and the @xcite contribution .",
    "figure 5a shows the distribution of all derived rvs for stars in the carina field as a function of elliptical distance from the center , including stars having rvs from @xcite ( green points ) , hydra observed stars from @xcite ( cyan points ) , stars with mike rvs ( red points ) , and giraffe data ( blue points ) . the elliptical radius of a star is defined to be the semi - major axis radius of the ellipse centered on carina ( with the ellipticity , center and position angle for the dsph as found by @xcite ) that passes through the star .",
    "figure 6a shows the integral of the rv distribution over all radius .",
    "a most obvious characteristic of these  full sample \" rv distributions is the presence of the prominent rv peak associated with the carina core near @xmath53 km s@xmath9 .",
    "however , a significant contribution of stars at other rvs may be seen , particularly from stars with @xmath54 km s@xmath9 from the milky way .",
    "these contaminants come predominantly from the giraffe sample , which was apparently primarily selected on the basis of positions of stars in the cmd . while the carina rv peak still stands out , the substantial background of non - carina stars makes it difficult to define an accurate rv criterion for cleanly isolating carina members .      figures 5b and 6b show the same rv distribution , but only for stars satisfying the conservative figure 3 criteria for identifying carina giant candidates by their washington @xmath0 photometry .",
    "this distribution of the ",
    "best \" photometric candidates makes it easier to define an appropriate additional criterion , based on rvs , for identifying carina members . anticipating that the velocity dispersion of carina members actually rises slightly outside the carina core",
    ", we define as an rv membership criterion the 3@xmath55 range defined by rvs for carina stars beyond @xmath56 ( twice the core radius ) , where we find a mean @xmath57 and a @xmath58 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this range is indicated by the dashed lines in figure 5b and the shaded region in figure 6b .",
    "this new rv selection criterion for mike and giraffe stars is narrower than that applied in @xcite , but this is because the rvs in the present sample have smaller random errors .",
    "this final set of stars , selected by our conservative cmd and 2cd criteria ( fig .",
    "3 ) is shown in fig . 5b .",
    "an additional feature apparent within the rv distribution of the  best photometric sample \" in figure 5b and 6b is the distinct group of stars with a clumped rv at an even _ more _ extreme velocity than the carina dsph .",
    "this feature is even more clear in figure 6d , where we show a histogram for a subsample of stars from figure 6b , in particular , stars with @xmath59 .",
    "their @xmath40 km s@xmath9 implies a significant retrograde motion for stars in this direction of the sky .",
    "the magnitudes and colors of these stars ( table 1 ) are also rather clumped , indicating similar spectral characteristics and an apparently similar ( and substantial ) distance . in ",
    "6 we explore further this moving group of giant stars from what appears to be a newly found halo substructure .",
    "a comparison of figures 5a and 6a with figures 5b and 6b suggests that the restrictiveness of our  conservative \" photometric selection of carina giants , while providing extremely pure samples of carina stars , also leads to a non - negligible level of incompleteness ( a well - known issue we have addressed before in  3.2 of paper vi ) .",
    "given that we now have the advantage of three criteria for discriminating carina giants and a large number of rvs from giraffe in the carina main body , it is worth reinvestigating the tradeoffs between sample size / completeness and sample purity .",
    "more specifically , can we expand any of the selection limits to admit substantially more carina stars from the giraffe sample without sacrificing the reliability of the membership census .",
    "* 2cd outliers : * figure 7 demonstrates some possibilities for expanding our membership acceptance criteria by showing the 2cd and cmd of stars satisfying our newly established carina rv - membership criterion , but falling outside one or the other ( or both ) our conservative photometric criteria ( plotted as the solid lines in figs . 3 and 7 ) .",
    "as may be seen in figure 7b , a large fraction of these stars lie _ just below _ our figure 3b giant selection in the 2cd .",
    "however , inspection of the distribution of stars in figure 3b clearly shows a strong , almost vertical giant star 2cd concentration at @xmath60 that extends below the adopted diagonal limit there .",
    "moreover , the 2cd analysis of giant and dwarf stars presented in @xcite makes clear that giant stars are commonly found at these positions of the cmd  a point demonstrated by the superposition of the @xcite  giant star boundary \" in figure 7b ( dotted lines ) .",
    "stars in figure 7 lying within the @xcite 2cd boundary but within the figure 3a cmd boundary are marked with red open triangles in figure 7 .",
    "given that these stars satisfy the rv , cmd and the @xcite 2cd criteria , we regard these stars as carina giants from here on",
    ".    * cmd outliers : * we may also investigate those stars that satisfy the rv and 2cd criteria but not our initial cmd boundary . in figure 7 these stars are marked with open blue circles for the stars that satisfy the stricter of the 2cd boundaries and green open circles for the stars satisfying the @xcite 2cd limit .",
    "almost all of these lie very close to the rgb limit .",
    "a number of them lie at a cmd position just above the strong red clump .",
    "given that carina has stellar populations as young as 0.6 - 1.0 gyr ( @xcite ) , it might not be too surprising to find some core he - burning stars lying above the canonical red clump from the dominant , older , more metal - poor carina population ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "other modest cmd outliers are in cmd positions consistent with those expected for asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "a similar outlier trend was found in paper vi , where it was noted that slightly expanding the magnitude width of the cmd selection criterion by a few tenths of a magnitude would increase completeness with virtually no decrease in reliability .",
    "given that previous conclusion , and that these stars satisfy the 2cd and rv criteria , we consider all of these outliers as carina members .",
    "* rv outliers : * finally , what about stars that fall within the 2cd and cmd criteria but just outside the rv criterion ? several of these stars are conspicuous in figure 5b .",

    "as may be seen in figure 5b , two stars with @xmath63 lie just below the rv cutoff and are probably very likely this kind of gaussian - wing outlier member .",
    "these stars ( c2661 and c161179 ) are indicated by the blue solid squares symbols in figures 5 and 7 , where they can be seen to be very solidly photometric members . nevertheless , because they are in the well - populated central part of carina , whether or not they are included in our analyses has very little effect .    on the other hand , as we discuss in  4.5",
    ", the velocity dispersion of carina appears to grow beyond the king limiting radius , and , even though our rv selection criterion was derived from stars with @xmath64 specifically for this reason , the rv dispersion that sets the selection criterion is dominated by stars with @xmath65 . beyond this range ,",
    "the dispersion not only grows , but , as we show in  5 , the rv distribution becomes flatter than gaussian .",
    "both larger velocity dispersions as well as more platykurtic velocity distributions are fully consistent with models of disrupting dsphs systems ( @xcite ; m06 ) .",
    "thus , even wider separated rv - outliers are not only conceivable at large radii , they are expected .",
    "we mark three of these from our mike sample  c1960448 , c2450090 and c2050415  with red square symbols in figures 5b and 7 .",
    "these stars , which lie within @xmath66 km s@xmath9 ( 3@xmath55 ) , @xmath67 km s@xmath9 ( 2@xmath55 ) and @xmath68 km s@xmath9 ( 1@xmath55 ) , respectively , of our carina rv membership limit , are again solidly within the photometric carina giant candidate selection criteria ( figure 7 ) .",

    "nevertheless , unlike in the cases of the sample - admitted 2cd and cmd outliers above , even though we can make a compelling case for the membership of all five of these rv outliers , we _ exclude them _ from our dynamical analyses to follow , so that we do not unduly bias our velocity results .",
    "figures 5c and 6c summarize the rv distributions of our final , expanded carina - member sample based on our two ( slightly widened ) photometric criteria and one velocity criterion . in tables 1 and 2",
    "we designate by the column  member \" those 260 stars considered to be members by the most conservative criteria and those additional 116 stars that have been admitted as carina members by the exceptions described in this subsection .",

    "figure 9 , which shows the ratio of the circular to elliptical radius ( @xmath74 ) for each star in the survey versus its circular radius , demonstrates the tendency for carina rv members outside the king limiting radius to lie along an extension of the position angle of carina s ellipticity and , indeed , to have an apparently even more elliptical distribution in this direction at larger radii .",
    "stars on the major axis will have @xmath75 and stars on the minor axis will have @xmath76 , according to the ellipticity of carina ( @xcite ) .",
    "that the mean @xmath74 increases at larger @xmath77 shows the tendency for the extended population to become even more stretched along the major axis , evokes the character expected of tidal tails , and is a key characteristic of dsph tidal disruption models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; m06 ) . further surveying for carina members over larger radii to see whether and how this trend may continue",
    "would provide a valuable check and important constraint on the nature of any tidal disruption .",
    "@xcite has already focused on the reliability of our methodology to assess dsph structure into extremely low surface brightness regimes , with specific focus on carina . however , with the now much better spectroscopic coverage as well as better photometry of the carina field we may reassess the effectiveness of our washington @xmath78 survey strategy .",
    "in addition , the mike spectroscopic sample , which was pre - selected based on the washington+ddo51 photometry , provides an interesting contrast with the giraffe sample , which was not .    a straight calculation of our success rate from the 48 carina rv - members among all 65 carina giant candidates with mike spectroscopy yields a success rate of 74% in identifying true dsph members . restricting the analysis to only stars outside the nominal ( ih95 ) king limiting radius yields a success rate of 55% ( 22 dsph members among 40 @xmath79 carina giant candidates with rvs ) , and this includes candidates at extremely low densities ( 0.058% the density of the carina core ) .",
    "however , 13 of the 40 carina giant candidates outside @xmath2 with determined rvs appear to be giant stars from _ another _ tidal stream with rather similar cmd characteristics as carina (  6 ) . though these stars are not attributable to carina , this newly discovered milky way feature might be argued as a success of the overall methodology we have been using in this series of papers to identify just this kind of halo substructure .",
    "were we to combine these stars with the true carina dsph members , our success rate in identifying ",
    "halo substructure \" stars rises to 94% .",
    "in contrast , the original giraffe sample was apparently selected only on the basis of the position of these stars in the cmd ( though not our cmd ) . among the 975 stars in the giraffe sample also in our catalogue , 390 , or 40.0% ,",
    "are found to have carina rvs  and this is for a sample highly concentrated to the main body of carina , with most stars having @xmath80 .",
    "however , had we applied our photometric selection criteria to the giraffe catalog 97.3% of the stars identified as carina giant candidates would have been found to be rv - members ( almost tripling the telescope efficiency ) . combining all available rv data at all radii , the washington+ddo51 pre - selection results in a 90.5% rv - member efficiency .",

    "circular orbits yield @xmath82 as low as 0.6 while more eccentric orbits can easily accommodate values as high as the ones derived by @xcite , but @xcite derive a carina @xmath89 based on an orbit with eccentricity 0.6 and apogalacticon twice that of carina s current distance .",
    "the new rv dataset presented here invites yet another @xmath82 evaluation . unlike previous determinations making use of a ",
    "central `` velocity dispersion from a relatively small number of stars in the very core of the dsph , our extensive and radially continuous velocity coverage means that the definition of ' ' central \" is not pre - defined by our available sample .",
    "if we assume that at least the inner parts of the dsph are well represented by a king profile , figure 4.11 from @xcite shows that the velocity dispersion of stars begins to deviate from its central value at about half the core radius .",
    "figure 10 shows the central velocity dispersion of carina as we grow the radius ( shown in units of core radius as measured by @xcite ) within which we include rvs in the dispersion computation . as we add successive stars out from the carina center the derived  central \" velocity dispersion ( calculated using the maximum likelihood method , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) reaches a value of @xmath90 km s@xmath9 at half the core radius ( computed from 87 total carina stars ) .",
    "this value , which is slightly larger than ( but consistent with ) the 6.8 km s@xmath9 value used by @xcite , is adopted to rederive the carina @xmath82 s .",

    "we adopt all these structural values from @xcite and obtain @xmath98 for carina where the main source of uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the central surface brightness .",

    "these results are in very good agreement with the ones found by @xcite despite the fact that the structural parameters they use are different from the ih95 ones adopted here . here",
    "we adopt the updated distance of carina from mateo ( 1998 ) , which is larger than the value used by @xcite , and this results in a larger half - light radius that compensates for the slightly larger luminosity adopted here .      with this large rv dataset in hand we can now assess the velocity dispersion behavior for carina to well past @xmath2 .",
    "to ascertain this trend , we have studied the velocity dispersion as a function of both elliptical and circular angular distance from the carina center . because the true shape of the gravitational potential and tidal boundary of a dsph are likely to be somewhere in between these limiting shapes , it is helpful to explore these two limiting cases . in each calculation of an rv dispersion 3-@xmath55 outliers",
    "have been removed iteratively , with the mean velocity for each bin reevaluated at each iteration and the dispersions estimated using the maximum likelihood method .",
    "we note that this method assumes that the velocity distribution follows a gaussian distribution everywhere which is not strictly true for carina .",
    "however , such non - gaussian behavior is apparent only in the outskirts of carina ( @xmath112 ;  5 ) , and the effect of the non - gaussian character found there is that the dispersion will tend to be slightly underestimated by the maximum likelihood method .",
    "figure 11 shows the derived carina velocity dispersion profiles for both choices of angular separation : the left panels show profiles plotted against elliptical radius , the right shows the same for circular radius . to test binning effects ,",
    "we have used both 23 and 46 stars per bin ( lower and upper panels respectively ) for stars inside @xmath2 , but because the number of stars with measured rv beyond this point is sparse , the last four dispersion points in each plot are binned at 10 stars each .",
    "the figure 11 carina profiles remain fairly flat throughout the radial extent of the main body of the dsph , to @xmath113 .",
    "such flat profiles over a comparable structural radial range have now been reported ( although not to the radial extent of this study ) for several dsphs : sculptor ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , draco ( @xcite ) , ursa minor ( @xcite ) , fornax ( @xcite ) , leo i ( @xcite ) and sagittarius ( majewski et al .",

    "flat velocity dispersion profiles are incompatabile with mass - follows - light dsph models ( with or without dark matter ) in complete dynamical equilibrium , where decreasing dispersions are expected at large radius , approaching zero as the cutoff radius of the distribution is approached . to explain the observed velocity behavior , @xcite suggest that the _ easiest _ assumption to discard is that mass follows light ; following this line of reasoning , a number of groups ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have invoked  two - component dsph models \" , where the dark mass extends far beyond its luminous counterpart and is responsible for the flat dispersion profile at large radius . yet , our mike observations of carina have now yielded the most extensive coverage of velocities in any dsph , including , for the first time , the measurement of the velocity dispersion of a dsph ( apart from sgr ) with a reasonable sample of stars beyond @xmath114 . as may be seen in figure 11 , the velocity dispersion for carina approximately doubles at these large separations  a result that is _ not _ explained with previous two - component models",

    "we show the mean rv ( in galactic standard of rest ) as a function of @xmath115-distance from the center of carina ( approximately the major axis of the satellite ) .",
    "no significant rv trend in the central part of carina that resembles a rotation curve is observed .",
    "however , beyond @xmath2 , a gentle velocity gradient is observed across the major axis of carina to the extent of our observations . over @xmath116 degree",
    "( 2.1 kpc ) , a peak - to - peak difference of @xmath68 km s@xmath9 is seen in this trend  a difference significantly larger than the error in the means for the binned points .",
    "this velocity trend is interesting because it has been predicted as a hallmark of tidal disruption by several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "according to @xcite ,  a velocity gradient across the galaxy that is larger than the velocity dispersion is the clearest signature [ of tidal destruction ] \" .",
    "figures 5 and 8 show that we have found rv - verified carina member stars to 4.5 @xmath2 .",

    "if the rv member at 4.5 @xmath2 is bound to carina , it sets a new lower limit for the physical extent and tidal radius of the dsph at 96.5 arcmin , or 2.84 kpc for an assumed distance of 101 kpc to carina ( @xcite ) . using this radius in the tidal limit equation ( @xcite ) :    @xmath117{\\rm ln}[(1+e)/(1-e)]+1 } } \\right \\}^{1/3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath118 is the orbital semimajor axis , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the mass of the dsph and the mw inside @xmath118 respectively and @xmath121 is the orbital eccentricity ( values for @xmath118 and @xmath121 taken from @xcite to be 61 kpc and 0.67 respectively ) , the lower limit to the carina mass becomes @xmath122 m@xmath4 assuming a mass of the milky way interior to @xmath118 of @xmath123 m@xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this estimated mass limit is further underestimated because we are taking the _ projected _ radius of the star as the actual , three - dimensional distance from the center .",

    "even a value for @xmath121 of 0.24 corresponding to an orbit with peri : apogalacticon of 63:102 kpc , ( their 95% confidence bounds for these parameters ) yields a @xmath82 that is an order of magnitude higher than the central value . ] on the other hand , if the star at 4.9 @xmath2 is a carina member and it is bound , it sets the tidal radius at 133.7 arcmin , or 3.93 kpc , enclosing an astounding mass of @xmath126 m@xmath4 , which yields @xmath127 .",
    "while some stars on trapped orbits can be found well outside the true tidal radius up to 2@xmath2 or even more ( see , e.g. , discussion in  7.3 of @xcite ) , the number should be extremely rare beyond 4@xmath2 . also , were one to expect the @xmath82 of a galaxy to grow with radius , the asymptotic values implied for carina are unreasonable high even when compared to values for galaxy clusters : 200 - 300 ( @xcite ) , which are thought to be approaching fair samples of the universe . from this line of reasoning",
    ", we must therefore conclude that either carina has an enormous , extended dark matter halo to create a @xmath82 an order of magnitude higher than the universe , or , more simply , that these widely separated carina stars are simply not bound .",
    "we ( muoz et al . 2005 ) have used similar arguments in our discussion of the ursa minor dsph , where a global @xmath82 of 1,400 to 14,400 was implied by the widest separated rv member , depending on the use of circular or elliptical radii , respectively . while the possibility that the widely separated muoz et al .",
    "ursa minor stars could be interlopers that just happen to have the same rv and color - magnitude positions ( i.e. approximate distances ) as ursa minor was explored and shown to be very unlikely , this miniscule possibility can not presently be completely discounted . however , the case for the widely separated carina stars being interlopers is far more difficult to make because of the sheer number of them : six ( possibly eight ) farther than 2@xmath2 .",
    "figure 13 , which shows the global mass and @xmath82 implied for carina as progressively more widely separated rv members are attributed as bound satellite members , demonstrates that the implication of an enormous implied carina @xmath82 is robust to the invalidation of any particular star , or even several , attributed as a sample interloper .",
    "the @xmath82 s in figure 13 are derived in two ways that make use of equation 3 : ( 1 ) the implied mass of carina is found by assuming a spherical potential for the dsph and the star s linear projected distance from the center of carina used as @xmath128 ( _ open circles _ ; again , this is a conservative lower limit , because we are working with _ projected _ radii ) .",
    "( 2 ) assuming that the distribution of stars around carina maintains a constant ellipticity with radius , we can assume there exists for every star not on the major axis a counterpart at the same _ elliptical radius _ on the major axis which is then used for @xmath128 .",
    "this assumption raises the lower limits on the implied @xmath82 s ( _ solid circles _ ) .",
    "the two methods for deriving the minimum implied @xmath82 probably span the actual limits , since galaxy potentials tend to be rounder than their density profiles .",
    "figure 13 demonstrates that all of the stars with @xmath129 or @xmath130 exceeding @xmath131 would need to be discounted as carina - associated to bring the global minimum @xmath82 to more standard values for the carina dsph ( such as the @xmath132 found from core fitting with the central velocity dispersion in  4.4 ) . in other words , if one assumes that the global @xmath82 of carina is that obtained using the central velocity dispersion , then the tidal boundary _ coincides _ with the radius at which the break in the density distribution is indeed observed .",
    "figure 5b attests to the relative purity of the carina dsph giant candidate sample created by our dual photometric selection criteria ( figs .",
    "3a and 3b ) : very few rv outliers are found among our carina giant candidates overall , and , in addition the small number of giant candidates we find that do _ not _ share the carina dsph rv lie predominantly in the 332 km s@xmath9 group .",
    "furthermore , figure 5b suggests that the outer halo is highly substructured ( at least when traced by giant stars ) , a result that is also evident from figure 2 in muoz et al .",
    "in such circumstances , to obtain substantial contamination in our survey would require a considerably unfortunate conspiracy of phenomena to produce a _",
    "second _ halo substructure with the same rv , approximate distance , and cmd distribution as carina ; we consider this possibility as unlikely .",
    "taken alone , figure 13 can be argued as a validation of the notion that dsphs like carina are surrounded by large dark matter halos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . according to @xcite , nfw - like halos that fit the carina central velocity dispersion ( adopted as 6.8 km s@xmath9 ) and central luminous king profile , even in the face of substantial tidal stripping of the dark halo , still maintain halos with ( 1 ) maxima in their circular velocity profile exceeding 50 km s@xmath9 that peak well outside @xmath2 , as well as ( 2 ) true tidal radii of 11 kpc or more .",

    "velocity shear * : as pointed out in  4.5 , the observed velocity trend observed in the carina system is that expected for tidally induced shear .",
    "however , we regard this observed trend with caution appropiate to the still meager statistics for this measurement in the outermost parts of carina .    * velocity dispersion profile * : we find a carina velocity dispersion profile that is flat and then rising well past the king limiting radius .",

    "thus , to explain the observed velocity dispersion trend requires an extremely extended dark halo of even larger dimensions and mass than implied by figure 13 .",

    "* commonality of disruption * : a number of discoveries of apparent halo moving groups or streams have recently been made ( including the one presented here in the foreground of carina , see  6 ) : the monoceros / gass stream ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the triand structure ( @xcite , majewski et al .",

    "this growing list of examples provides increasingly solid evidence of a highly substructured milky way halo , and to the _ commonality _ of tidal disruption of stellar systems in the milky way halo ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such tidal streams must come from _ somewhere _ and dsph satellites are the most obvious available source .",
    "the new mike rvs have revealed an additional coherent rv peak in the field centered on the carina dsph ( fig .",

    "the strong rv coherence of this group makes it even more unlikely that it is from a dynamically hot , well - mixed , random galactic halo population , but the dispersion is , however , of order what one sees in dwarf satellite galaxies : for example , the dispersion is comparable to those measured in the extended parts of the carina system ( fig .  11 )  which we have argued to be likely tidal debris  as well as those measured all along the trailing tidal arm of the sgr dwarf debris stream ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the lack of any spatial concentration of these stars across the relatively large span of our survey fields ( see fig .",
    "8b ) and their very low apparent density ( a factor of @xmath145 more diffuse than the mean @xmath146 giant star density for carina stars of the same apparent magnitude ) suggest that these stars represent either tidal debris from a satellite galaxy or an extremely low density part of a very extended satellite .",
    "figure 14a shows the distribution of stars in this moving group within the cmd of all stars selected to be giants in our photometric survey ( according to the tenets of figure 3b ) , along with the  carina dsph rgb \" boundary we have used in figure 3a .",

    "14b ) ; moreover , their relative position in the 2cd compared to carina stars suggests that the 332 km s@xmath9 stars are more metal rich than the mean carina star ( see @xcite ) , assuming similar [ mg / fe ] ratios .",
    "an independent test of the relative metallicities of these stars comes directly from the spectra : despite the relatively low @xmath33 of the spectra ( which were taken for rvs ) , in many cases the strong calcium infrared triplet lines are clear . when possible the equivalent width for each triplet line within each mike spectrum was measured .",
    "we found that for all three calcium lines the equivalent widths for the 332 km s@xmath9 group stars were about double those of carina stars with a similar @xmath147 color .",
    "we also used a photometric bandpass method for measuring the calcium infrared triplet line strengths because ( 1 ) it is perhaps more reliable for relatively low @xmath33 spectra , ( 2 ) it averages results over three lines , and ( 3 ) a formalism exists to convert these photometric line measures into a formal [ fe / h ] value .",
    "we limit this work to mike spectra with @xmath148 per pixel and follow the bandpass definitions summarized in @xcite .",
    "we point out that since our original survey was not intended to measure metallicities , we did not observe an appropriate set of stellar calibrators of the metallicity scale . however , since a primary intention is to compare the relative metallicity between the carina and 332 km s@xmath9 group samples , precise calibration is not necessary . therefore , we followed the prescription outlined in @xcite for converting calcium equivalent width and stellar gravity to [ fe / h ] , adopting the calibration for this procedure from @xcite .",

    "lower rv precision of the measurements for the stars found outside the carina survey region . ] even more intriguing is that this velocity trend matches that found for other lmc tracers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) at similar position angles from the lmc core over a 13@xmath11 angular separation from the lmc center , and where the trend is attributed to the rotation curve of the lmc ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "these turned out to have rvs ( 317 and 342 km s@xmath9 ) consistent with membership in the 332 km s@xmath9 group , which further vindicates a magellanic cloud provenance of this moving group .",
    "km s@xmath9 , therefore we do not include them in the velocity dispersion calculation but only use them as membership information .",
    "] comparison of figures 14a and 18a certainly evokes the notion of a diaphanous presence of lmc stars in the foreground of the carina dsph , which has given rise to the 332 km s@xmath9 group .",
    "finally , within the giraffe rv dataset , we found four more stars with velocities matching the 332 km s@xmath9 group and positions in the cmd ( red open circles in figure 18 ) reasonably compatible with being lmc red clump stars . adding these four stars changes only marginally the mean velocity and the velocity dispersion of the moving group .    with the possible connection to the magellanic clouds in mind , we can bring the abundance argument full circle to look for self - consistency of this hypothesis .",
    "for example , if the originally identified 332 km s@xmath9 group members are parts of the red clump of the lmc , then for each star we can recalculate its [ fe / h ] from the infrared triplet strength assuming the @xmath161 of the lmc red clump .",

    ", the collective evidence compellingly suggests that we have found widely dispersed stars from one of the magellanic clouds  the lmc being more likely  in the foreground of the carina dsph .",
    "as with the examples of the carina dsph explored earlier , and the ursa minor system explored in @xcite , the presence of extremely widely displaced , but satellite - associated stars would seem to have profound implications for the structure of the lmc .",
    "one can use equation ( 45 ) from @xcite to estimate the mass of the lmc given a certain tidal radius . for our most widely separated star in the 332 km s@xmath9 group ( @xmath159 away from the center of the lmc ) to remain bound to the lmc implies a minimum lmc mass of @xmath163 m@xmath4 assuming a milky way mass interior to the lmc of @xmath164 m@xmath4 ( @xcite ; the @xcite model gives almost the identical milky way mass ) .",
    "this inferred lmc mass is @xmath165 times more than that reported by @xcite ( @xmath166 m@xmath4 ) to a 13@xmath11 radius and consistent with the @xmath167 m@xmath4 lmc mass derived if we assume a flat lmc rotation curve to this distance .",
    "the implied 20.2 kpc minimum tidal radius is now more than 33% ( 1@xmath55 ) greater than the @xmath168 kpc tidal radius estimated by @xcite .",

    "the inferred total @xmath82 would exceed 10 in solar units .",
    "an even larger mass is implied by the fact that the velocity dispersion of the 332 km s@xmath9  9.8 km s@xmath9  while @xmath169 smaller than the dispersions of tracers @xmath170 kpc from the lmc , as might be expected in the outer limits of a galaxy halo , are still quite larger than the expected , small asymptotic value at the  edge \" of a galaxy .",

    "( 2 ) the magellanic cloud stars we observe in the foreground are not bound to the lmc .",
    "the colder dynamics of the 332 km s@xmath9 stars might be explained through a tidal debris origin .",
    "but if unbound , stars in the direction of the carina dsph are _ not _ aligned with the expected direction of an lmc tidal tail , based on both the typical proper motions measured for the lmc ( summarized in table 1 of @xcite ) as well as the direction of the hi magellanic stream ( both the leading and trailing arms )  both lie in a roughly orthogonal direction .",
    "this is not necessarily a problem , since stars will be tidally stripped anywhere along the satellite - milky way equipotential , whereas we have only explored one position angle from the lmc here . on the other hand , the carina survey field _",
    "does _ happen to lie more or less along the axis defined by the lmc and smc .",
    "a tidal disruption scenario involving an interaction of the lmc and smc might conceiveably throw magellanic stars out along this axis .",
    "for example , the velocities of our magellanic giant stars are consistent with those of the carbon stars found by @xcite in the same general direction ( see figs . 16 and 17 ) , and which these authors attribute to a  polar ring \" of smc debris around the lmc .",
    "alternatively , the widely separated  lmc \" stars may constitute residue from the disruption of a former  greater magellanic galaxy \" which has often been invoked as a possible explanation for the curious alignment of a number of milky way satellites and globular clusters along a  magellanic plane \" that also includes the hi magellanic stream ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a dynamical association of ursa minor , draco , the lmc and the smc is suggested by their common motions along one great circle ( see , e.g. , fig . 3 of @xcite ) . were this group of milky way satellites truly daughters of the break up of a greater magellanic system or produced together as tidal dwarfs during a major merger with the milky way , their close , but not precise , alignment in a single plane might indicate the possibility of a potentially broad stellar swath of loosely coherent magellanic plane debris .",
    "but if the 332 km s@xmath9 stars represent dynamically _ old _ tidal debris like this , one might not expect it to so well match the current distance of the lmc , nor its velocity ( or , even more coincidentally , the velocity extrapolated from the lmc velocity trend to this position in the sky ) .    only with further surveying for additional  332 km s@xmath9 group \" stars in other directions around the magellanic clouds can one hope to test such hypotheses .",
    "we intend to explore these possibilities further elsewhere ( nidever et al .",
    ", in preparation ) with a larger database of outer lmc stars collected over a larger area .",
    "our survey for diffuse halo substructure in a large field around the carina dsph has yielded the following primary results on the structure of both the carina dsph and the lmc ( or magellanic clouds ) :     using a combination of new washington+@xmath51 photometry and new echelle spectroscopy we have confirmed the existence of an extended , power law component in the density distribution of carina , which can be modeled as a  king + power law \" .",
    "such density distributions are characteristic of those found in models of disrupted satellites and has also been observed in the tidally disrupting sgr dsph .     with magellan+mike echelle spectroscopy of giant star candidates in the carina field we have establish the existence of carina stars to the limits of our photometric survey field , with confirmed carina members to at least 4.5@xmath2 , and likely 4.9@xmath2 . these detections represent the most widely separated stars ( in terms of @xmath2 ) found associated with any dsph ( apart from the sgr dsph ) to date . beyond verifying the existence of the extended carina population ,",
    "these widely separated member stars have profound implications for the structure of carina : if the stars are bound , carina must have a minimum total @xmath82 of 6,300 in solar units , or 16,000 in the case of the 4.9@xmath2 example .     with the addition of vlt+giraffe spectroscopic data and other published data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) within @xmath2 to our mike velocities at large @xmath2 , we have good and continuous sampling of the carina rv distribution to well past @xmath2 by 408 confirmed carina members . with these data",
    ", we have rederived the central and global @xmath82 for carina , assuming a single - component model and using the core - fitting technique ; the results yield 43@xmath171 and 41@xmath172 ( m / l)@xmath4 respectively , where the main source of uncertainty comes from the luminosity .",
    "these results are significantly at odds with the lower limits to the global @xmath82 found using the outlying carina members above .",
    " with the extensive rv coverage we have also derived the line of sight radial velocity dispersion profile for carina to @xmath173 , the most extensive such profile so far ( by more than a factor of two ) for any dsph .",
    "the profile is flat to past @xmath2 and then exhibits a rise in the dispersion to almost twice the inner value at @xmath174 .",
    "such results are incompatible with completely bound , mass - follows - light dsph models , but also challenge two - component models that account for the flat dispersion via an extended dark halo surrounding the dsph . in the latter case an enormous halo",
    "is needed , one significantly more massive than that implied above for simply keeping the @xmath175 carina stars bound , since the significant dispersion at large radius implies that the tidal radius is much farther out .    ",
    "while with our new data we can not definitively rule out a _ very _ large , and extended dark halo for carina  one producing a global @xmath82 approaching as much as 6,300 or more  we conclude that a simpler , less contrived scenario that provides a good match to _ all _ available observations of carina is that it is tidally disrupting and we have identified some of its unbound stars .",
    "this scenario simultaneously accounts for the following observed features of the carina system : ( 1 ) its",
    " king+power law \" density profile , which is a natural product of tidal disruption ; ( 2 ) the fact that the extended component of carina lies predominantly along its major axis and shows increasing ellipticity with radius , as would be expected in nascent tidal tails ; ( 3 ) carina stars extending from the core to the edge of the survey area ; ( 4 ) the flat , then rising velocity dispersion profile with radius ; and ( 5 ) a flattening of the rv distribution with radius , from gaussian in the core to platykurtic at large radius . explaining this combination of observed carina properties with extended dark halo scenarios will require substantial efforts to create successful ad hoc models . on the other hand ,",
    "all of the above carina features not only resemble those seen in the established , tidally disrupting sgr dsph system , but have been well - matched by mass - follows - light models ( presented in a companion paper , muoz et al . 2006 ) of disrupting dsphs having the nominal central @xmath132 derived here .",
    " finally , we have detected a second , strongly velocity - coherent structure in the carina field with even higher rv than carina .",
    "the more metal rich stars constituting this moving group have cmd positions consistent with lmc red clump stars and their velocities follow the extrapolated velocity trend expected for lmc halo stars . with additional washington@xmath17 photometry and follow - up spectroscopy we have traced this population from 4@xmath11 separation from the center of the lmc out to the 22@xmath11 separation of the carina field center .",
    "these stars either represent the detection of magellanic stellar tidal debris , or , if bound to the lmc , imply a significantly larger mass and tidal radius for the lmc than previously determined .",
    "traditionally , debate over the kinematical and structural properties of the diffuse , low surface brightness dsphs has tended to polarize around two primary interpretations : ( 1 ) that dsphs are dark matter dominated ( e.g. , @xcite ) galaxies , with @xmath82 reaching to as much as 100 ( m / l)@xmath4 , making them structurally different compared to globular clusters and de systems . the prime observational evidence to support this claim is the relatively high measured central velocity dispersions that",
    " coupled with an assumption of dynamical equilibrium  imply masses far in excess of that inferred by the luminous component .",
    "alternatively , ( 2 ) dsphs have also been discussed as systems partly or completely out of virial equilibrium ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such an assertion seeks to explain the large central velocity dispersions of dsphs through inflation by tidal heating or other dynamical effects , allowing for much more modest dsph masses , consistent with no dark matter .    to date , despite much observational and theoretical effort , the physical evidence has generally remained unpersuasive enough to dislodge the most ardent adherents to these models .",
    "reinforcing viewpoints have been several  all or nothing \" notions introduced into the debate , including : ( 1 ) the assumption that dark matter dominated systems are in dynamical equilibrium throughout their entire physical extent ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; or , ( 2 ) if evidence of tidal stripping is found around a dsph , the system must be devoid of dark matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , more recent work intended to _ clarify _ the physical nature of dsphs has , instead , increased the apparent gulf between diametrical viewpoints .",
    "@xcite had previously suggested that  only @xmath176 additional observations [ of dsph star rvs ] at 0.75 times the tidal radius",
    "would be required to distinguish clearly between an mfl distribution and an extended halo or disrupted remnant model with a flat or radially rising velocity dispersion . \" yet , despite the fact that the latest dsphs spectroscopic surveys have provided rvs of hundreds of dwarf members to beyond 0.75@xmath2 in several systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we are apparently no closer to a consensus view of dsph dynamics . while this is partly due to technical differences in interpretation of even the same databases ( e.g. , wilkinson et al .",
    "2004 , okas et al .",
    "2005 , muoz et al .",
    "2005 ) , in general most studies are finding flat dsph velocity dispersion profiles to be the norm .",
    "as discussed several times here , such profiles are produced naturally in dsph models undergoing tidal disruption ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; m06 ) .",
    "however , rather than settling the issue , these rather flat velocity dispersion profiles have prompted the development of even more extreme , two - component , extended dark halo dsph models with _ substantially higher _ bound masses and total @xmath82  exceeding 400 or even 1000 @xmath177 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these models are partly motivated by the proposition that the so - called missing satellite problem of @xmath140cdm cosmologies could be alleviated if galactic dsph satellites inhabit the most massive sub - halos  i.e. , m@xmath178 m@xmath4 , or equivalently v@xmath179 30  40 km s@xmath9 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "25 km s@xmath9 can succesfully reproduce the velocity dispersion profiles of these dsphs . ]    from the numerous arguments laid out thus far , we are persuaded that the weight of evidence militates against the extreme halo hypothesis for carina in favor of a tidal disruption scenario . yet",
    "one more argument favors the latter hypothesis : an extended dm halo of the magnitude our data would require in this scenario has ancillary implications for the _ chemical evolution _ of carina that are problematical . despite having a complex and episodic star formation history ,",
    "carina has a relatively low mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath180 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite note that galaxy masses of order a few times @xmath181 m@xmath4  consistent with the mass of carina derived from central velocity dispesion ( @xcite ;  4.4 )  are low enough to suffer metal - enriched winds , which promote preferential depletion of metals but retention of sufficient gas to allow further star formation at a continued , relatively low mean metallicity ( like carina s ) .",
    "a larger galactic potential diminishes the possibility of blow - out / blow - away of either gas or metals ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , leading to closed - box enrichment ( @xcite ) . but @xcite find that the metallicity distribution function of carina is not well matched by a closed - box model .",
    "if carina has an enormous extended dm halo , it would have resulted in an enrichment that it is not observed ( @xcite ) . however , a more modest carina dark matter content is not discounted by this argument .",
    "one of our goals in this paper ( see also @xcite ) has been to push the measurement of physical parameters in one dsph to hitherto unexplored regions to see if , in at least one system , new data in the extrema can definitively rein in the range of possible models .",
    "we conclude that the new breed of extremely large @xmath82 , extended dark matter halos is less likely to apply to the present carina dsph than a tidal disruption scenario , which more readily explains all present observational data on the satellite.cdm if the models produce subhalos that are sufficiently stripped to reach the luminous matter . ]",

    "it has recently been claimed ( @xcite ) that `` sgr was a rare event , not a paradigm for the average '' .",
    "this conclusion has been motivated by the notion that were systems like the carina dsph tidally disrupting , then the halo should have large numbers of youngish ( e.g. , blue main sequence ) stars in larger numbers than seen ( @xcite ) .",
    "such an analysis presumes that the _ present _ carina system is representative of the typical stellar population that would have been contributed to the halo by tidally disrupting dsph systems _ including the former carina_. in contrast , as was previously demonstrated in @xcite , if for a hubble time carina were disrupting at the fractional mass loss rate implied by its density profile ,  i.e. @xmath183 gyr@xmath9 ( see  2.2 )  then far more stars from carina s oldest population would have been lost by now than from either the intermediate - aged or young populations in carina .",
    "this is also a reasonable explanation for why the carina system today is dominated by it s intermediate - aged population , and even for why there seems to be a radial metallicity and age gradient in carina : the present balance of populations bound to carina likely reflects the competing interplay of star formation history and mass loss history ( @xcite ) in this disrupting analogue of the sgr dsph galaxy .",
