    "observation of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) may require a good background rejection and a correlation of the wimp direction with the galactic motion through the dark matter halo .",
    "both requirements can be accomplished with detectors using low - pressure gas as the target material .",
    "however , the low density of gaseous detectors requires large detector volumes , and the shortness of signal tracks necessitate fine detector granularities . in the case of cf@xmath0 as the detector material , one ton of gas occupies a volume of approximately @xmath1  m@xmath2 at 50  torr of pressure , and a 50  kev fluorine recoil travels 1.5  mm .",
    "therefore , a multi - cubic meter detector with resolution of the order of hundreds of micrometers is needed for a directional dark matter experiment .",
    "a schematic of the dmtpc detector is shown in figure  [ vessel ] .",
    "a stainless steel vessel is filled with 50 - 100  torr of cf@xmath0 gas and holds two back - to - back time - projection - chambers ( tpc s ) .",
    "ionization electrons that are created by recoiling nucleus are drifted in an electric field ( @xmath3  v / cm ) toward the amplification region so they can be detected .",
    "each drift cage is made of stainless steel rings with the inner diameter of 25  cm and a total height of 25  cm .",
    "the separation and the width of the rings are optimized using a calculation based on the finite elements method in order to achieve uniform electric field in the vertical direction with a minimum number of drift rings .",
    "the perpendicular ( radial ) component of the electric field is less than 1% in the entire fiducial volume .",
    "the height of the drift region is limited by the electron diffusion  @xcite .",
    "a double - sided amplification region uses a solid copper for the anode and a stainless steel mesh with 256  @xmath4 m pitch as the grounded electrode . a detailed description and performance evaluation of such amplification system",
    "is given in ref .",
    "scintillation photons created during the avalanche charge multiplication are collected by nikon photographic lens with f - stop ratio of 1.2 and focal distance of 55  mm , and are recorded with apogee u6 cameras using a kodak 1001e ccd chip .",
    "the total area imaged by each ccd is @xmath5 @xmath6 so the total active volume is approximately 10 liters .",
    "the avalanche creates approximately 3 electrons for each scintillation photon with the wavelength between 200 - 800  nm , or approximately an order of magnitude more electrons than photons in the wavelength range that is accessible to ccd detectors  @xcite .",
    "we use the charge readout to improve the energy resolution of low - momentum nuclear recoils .",
    "the signal is collected from the anode and passed through a charge - sensitive preamplifier ( ortec pc109 ) and shaping amplifier ( ortec 485 ) before being recorded with a digitizer ( tek 1002 ) .",
    "we demonstrate the ability to determine the directional sense of low - momentum recoils , the ` head - tail ' effect , by exposing the detectors to neutrons from a @xmath7cf source .",
    "the ionization rate of a low - momentum nuclear recoil decreases as it slows down in the detector gas , and the sense of its direction can be deduced from the scintillation profile along the track .",
    "an image of the recoil track is shown in the left plot of figure  [ fg::recoil ] .",
    "neutrons are incident from the right , and the nuclear recoil also propagates from the right , which is evident from a decreasing light intensity .",
    "the sense of direction in single events can be reconstructed down to approximately 100  kev of recoil energy  @xcite , but a larger data sample is needed to determine the full potential of the detector .    in order to measure the energy resolution , we expose the detector to x - rays from @xmath8fe source .",
    "a histogram of amplitudes of signal pulses is shown in the right plot in figure  [ fg::xray ] .",
    "the peak corresponds to 5.9  kev x - rays from k-@xmath9 lines , and its width gives the energy resolution of approximately 19% .",
    "directional detection of dark matter requires large detector volumes with fine granularities .",
    "we have built a prototype detector consisting of two tpc modules filled with low - pressure cf@xmath0 gas , and demonstrated reconstruction of the directionality and directional sense . a detector system based on",
    "this technology can improve current limits on spin - dependent dark matter interactions with approximately @xmath10 of cf@xmath0 exposure , and test new physics models with approximately @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "we are currently taking data with the 10-liter prototype at the surface laboratory , and making preparations for operation in an underground laboratory .",
    "completion of these tests will allows us to design a cubic - meter module that will be a building block of a ton - scale detector .",
    "we wish to thank hayk yegorian for his valuable help in electric field calculation and charge readout tests , and timur sahin for creation of geant4 simulation of the detector .",
    "we also wish to thank the office of environment , health & safety and the laboratory for nuclear science mit for technical support .",
    "we acknowledge support by the advanced detector research program of the u.s .",
