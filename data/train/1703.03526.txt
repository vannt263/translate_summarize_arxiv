    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only @xmath3 290 quasars are at @xmath5 5 . in the distribution of quasar redshift",
    ", there is an obvious gap of known quasars at 5.3 @xmath6 5.7 , due to their similar optical colors to that of late - type stars ( see the redshift distribution in sec .",

    "compared to the studies at lower redshift and higher redshift , this gap posts significant limit on the study of quasar evolution from @xmath1 5 to 6 , over the post - reionization epoch .",
    "observations of the gunn - peterson effect using absorption spectra of high redshift quasars suggest that reionization is just completing at @xmath7 6 , possibly with a tail to @xmath7 5.5 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the physical conditions of the post reionization igm , at @xmath1 5 - 6 , provides the basic boundary conditions of models of reionization , such as the evolution of igm temperature , photon mean free path , metallicity and the impact of helium reionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they place strong constraints on reionization topology as well as on the sources of reionization and chemical feedback by early galaxy population .",
    "ly@xmath8 opacity measurement directly probes the evolution of igm .",
    "following @xcite , several new measurements about the ly@xmath8 opacity at 5 @xmath6 6 are given @xcite , but igm statistics are still poorly constrained at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "moreover , a quasar sample in this redshift range is also a key to study the evolution of quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) and black hole growth . at high redshift , the qlf and black hole evolution",
    "have been measured at @xmath1 5 and 6 @xcite . however , at @xmath1 5.5 they are still poorly measured due to the lack of a complete quasar sample . @xcite derived the quasar spatial density at @xmath1 4 , 4.9 and 6 , and fitted a luminosity - dependent density evolution model to the combined dataset .",
    "they concluded that the quasar number density evolution steepens at high redshift , such that luminous quasars decline as a population more steeply at @xmath5 5 than from @xmath10 4 to @xmath10 5 ( also * ? ? ?",
    "however , the exact evolution of quasar density from @xmath11 = 5 to 6 is unclear because of the small size and high incompleteness of existing @xmath1 5.5 quasar sample . the quasar number density at @xmath12 is also needed to estimate the contribution of quasars to the ionizing background just after the reionization epoch .",
    "@xcite suggested that there was a rapid black hole mass growth phase after @xmath1 6 .",
    "study of black hole growth at @xmath1 4.8 supports that the notion of fast smbh growth at this epoch , corresponding to probably the first such phase for most smbh @xcite .",
    "studying bh growth properties at @xmath0 will fill in the missing link between @xmath13 and 6 .    to answer the questions posted above , a large , uniformly selected sample of quasars at @xmath14 is needed .",
    "however , so far there has not ever been a complete quasar survey at @xmath0 .",
    "as shown in  2 , broad - band colors of @xmath0 quasars are very similar to those of much more numerous m dwarfs , when a small number of passbands are used .",
    "therefore , to avoid the lager number of star contaminations , previous quasar selections have always excluded the region of m dwarf locus in @xmath15 color - color diagram . as a result , most surveys of high - redshift quasars have avoided the color space occupied by @xmath12 quasars and are highly incomplete at this redshift . to construct a large uniform @xmath1 5.5 quasar sample , a more effective selection to separate quasars from m dwarf in this most contaminated region is required .    in this paper , we report initial results from a new search that focuses on the selection of @xmath0 quasars .",
    "our new color selection criteria based on optical , near- and mid - ir colors have yielded 17 quasars in the redshift range of 5.3 @xmath2 5.7 during the pilot observation described here .",
    "our optical / ir color selection technique and candidate selection using a combination of existing and new imaging surveys are described in section 2 .",

    "a summary is given in section 6 .",

    "all sdss data shown in this paper are corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "at @xmath1 5 , most quasars are undetectable in u - band and g - band because of the presence of lyman limit systems ( llss ) , which are optically thick to the continuum radiation from the quasar @xcite .",

    "the @xmath24 color becomes redder and most @xmath5 5.1 quasars begin to enter the m dwarf locus in the @xmath15 color - color diagram , which makes it very difficult to select @xmath25 5.2 quasars only with optical colors , especially at @xmath1 5.5 , where quasars have essentially the same optical colors as m dwarfs ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "for quasars at @xmath1 5.5 , if we include the whole region overlapped by m dwarf locus on the @xmath15 color - color diagram , we will include a huge number of m dwarfs . in this case , although using w1-w2 color can help to reject a part of m dwarfs , those remained m dwarfs will still result in a high contamination rate .",
    "more colors are needed to further reject m dwarfs .",
    "nir photometry covering the wavelength range from 9000 @xmath32 to 2@xmath36 m ( @xmath37 bands ) will effectively distinguish @xmath7 5.5 quasars from late - type m dwarfs .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of @xmath38 quasars are mainly dominated by a power - law spectrum with a slope @xmath39 at the wavelength range from ly@xmath8 to h@xmath40 , which is flatter than that of m dwarfs , a grey body spectrum .",

    "we thus add @xmath44-w1 , @xmath41 and @xmath45 w2 colors , together with the @xmath46 color - color diagram and w1-w2 color cut , to construct our new color selection criteria of @xmath0 quasars .",
    "figure 2 shows the loci of quasars and m dwarfs in various color - color diagrams used in our new selection . for quasars",

    ", we used the spectroscopically identified m dwarfs from querying the sdss dr10 catalog , and obtained their nir photometric data from ulas and allwise .",
    "as shown , in the @xmath46 color - color diagram , m dwarfs locate in a similar region as @xmath1 5.5 quasars . on the other hand , on the @xmath42w1/w1@xmath33w2 and @xmath49/@xmath43w2 color diagrams ,",
    "most of simulated quasars could be separated from stars due to their redder @xmath42w1 , w1@xmath33w2 , @xmath49 and @xmath43w2 colors . to improve the efficiency of selection and reduce the size of candidate sample , we restrict our selection to the cleanest regions ( purple dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 ) , which are still able to include most quasars .",
    "we used the following photometric datasets to select candidates of @xmath0 quasars . in optical range , we used sdss dr10 photometry catalog which covered @xmath50 deg@xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath11 bands . in near - infrared wavelengths , the published large area covered deep nir photometric database with @xmath54 , @xmath44 , @xmath55 and @xmath56(@xmath57 ) bands are ulas @xcite covering @xmath3 4000 @xmath58 in the northern sky and the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ; * ? ? ? * ) covering the whole southern sky . to expand the available survey area , although vhs focus on the southern sky , we also did the selection in the overlap area between vhs dr3 and sdss , a @xmath3 800 square degree field . for w1 and w2 bands , we used allwise dataset .",
    "the allwise program combined photometric data from the wise cryogenic @xcite and neowise @xcite post - cryogenic survey phases and mapped the entire sky with w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath36 m ) bands .",
    "allwise have high detection completeness of know quasars over almost all redshifts @xcite . due to the shallower detections in w3 and w4 bands , we only used w1 and w2 data .",
    "therefore , we carried out a quasar survey for @xmath1 5.5 quasars based on sdss , ulas / vhs and allwise photometric data within a @xmath3 4800 @xmath58 field .",
    "the allwise detection completeness of high redshift quasars ( @xmath59 ) is 50% at z band magnitude @xmath3 20.5 @xcite and decreases rapidly towards fainter end .",
    "allwise w1 and w2 , especially w2 , are not deep enough to detect @xmath1 5.5 quasars with sdss @xmath11 band magnitude fainter than 20.5 .",
    "we thus limited our selection and main candidate sample with @xmath60 20.5 mag .",
    "we started the candidate selection from a catalog of candidates which met our optical cuts , and selected only pointed sources .",
    "we limited our selection area to galactic latitude b @xmath4 20@xmath61 or b @xmath62 due to the quickly increasing star contaminations at lower galactic latitude .",
    "the optical color selection criteria we used for candidate selection are summarised as following , also shown in figure 2 .",
    "here we did not limit the signal - to noise ratio ( @xmath63 ) in @xmath29 band since @xmath29 band may be the drop - out band .",
    "@xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    we limited @xmath15 colors and required drop - outs in @xmath52 and @xmath53 bands to ensure the redshift range of quasars .",
    "we then cross - matched optical selected objects with ulas dr10 & vhs dr3 and allwise data using a 2@xmath69 cross radius .",
    "we required objects to be detected in @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath11 , @xmath44 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , w1 and w2 bands .",

    "a @xmath70 color cut was added here for further rejection of stars . to ensure the w1 and w2 photometry quality , we limited the signal - to - noise ratio to be higher than 5 in w1 and 3 in w2 .",
    "we did not further limit the @xmath63 in @xmath37 bands as the photometry in these bands are deep enough .",

    "<S> we present initial results from the first systematic survey of luminous @xmath0 quasars . </S>",
    "<S> quasars at @xmath1 5.5 , the post - reionization epoch , are crucial tools to explore the evolution of intergalactic medium , quasar evolution and the early super - massive black hole growth . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been very challenging to select quasars at redshifts 5.3 @xmath2 5.7 using conventional color selections , due to their similar optical colors to late - type stars , especially m dwarfs , resulting in a glaring redshift gap in quasar redshift distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a new selection technique for @xmath1 5.5 quasars based on optical , near - ir and mid - ir photometric data from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , ukirt infrared deep sky surveys - large area survey ( ulas ) , vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ) and wide field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) . from our pilot observations in sdss - ulas / vhs area </S>",
    "<S> , we have discovered 15 new quasars at 5.3 @xmath2 5.7 and 6 new lower redshift quasars , with sdss z band magnitude brighter than 20.5 . </S>",
    "<S> including other two @xmath1 5.5 quasars already published in our previous work , we now construct an uniform quasar sample at 5.3 @xmath2 5.7 with 17 quasars in a @xmath3 4800 square degree survey area . for further application in a larger survey area </S>",
    "<S> , we apply our selection pipeline to do a test selection by using the new wide field j band photometric data from a preliminary version of the ukirt hemisphere survey ( uhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we successfully discover the first uhs selected @xmath1 5.5 quasar . </S>"
