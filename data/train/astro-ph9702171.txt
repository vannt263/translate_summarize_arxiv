    "an important aim of the study of young stellar objects ( ysos ) has been to classify them in an evolutionary sequence and identify when in this sequence protostellar collapse occurs .",
    "the most widely used classification scheme is that of lada and wilking ( 1984 ) and lada ( 1987 ) which divides ysos into 3 categories based on the slope of their infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the oldest population , class iii , have a blackbody - like sed and are interpreted as pre - main - sequence stars without a disk .",
    "class ii sources have a flat or negatively - sloped sed in the infrared and are understood as classical t tauri stars with an optically thick disk of circumstellar dust .",
    "class i sources have an sed that rises with wavelength up to 100 @xmath7 m and are believed to be collapsing protostars ( adams et al .",
    "1987 ; wilking et al.1989a ) .",
    "recently , andr , ward - thompson , and barsony ( 1993 ) ( hereafter awb ) noted that several sources have not been detected in the near - infrared and have blackbody - like seds that peak in the submillimeter , suggesting extremely low dust temperatures ( @xmath8 20 k ) .",
    "they called these sources class 0 ( which they defined as a submillimeter source with l@xmath9/l@xmath10 @xmath11 2 @xmath12 10@xmath13 ) because their cold temperature suggested an object even younger than typical class i objects .",
    "barsony ( 1994 ) listed the following as characteristics of these sources in addition to the low l@xmath9/l@xmath10 : a sed like a 30 k blackbody , undetected at @xmath14 10 @xmath7 m , and a molecular outflow .",
    "chen et al .  ( 1995 ) found that class 0 sources have bolometric temperatures ( t@xmath9 ) less than 70 k. t@xmath9 is the temperature of a blackbody with the same mean frequency as the sed of the source ( myers & ladd 1993 ) .",
    "andr and montmerle ( 1994 ) argued that class 0 sources have more circumstellar mass than stellar mass .",
    "they suggested that class 0 sources are still in their active accretion phase , while class i sources have already accreted most of their mass .",
    "if this suggestion is correct , class 0 sources should be good candidates to show kinematic evidence of collapse .",
    "the goal of this project was to survey all of the class 0 objects that had been cited in the astronomical literature for signs of protostellar collapse . since we were unable to determine if every claimed class 0 object meets the criterion of awb or barsony , the selected sample of 23 sources ( see table 1 ) includes any source that has been identified as either a definite or a probable class 0 source .",
    "although this criterion is rather loose , we have checked the credentials of our sources by computing t@xmath9 , using the procedure of myers & ladd ( 1993 ) , for all sources with sufficient data . since many of these sources have few spectral data points , we relaxed one criterion of myers & ladd .",
    "they required six spectral data points but we used as few as four , which seemed to be adequate as long as the photometric data lay on either side of the peak of the sed .",
    "the values of t@xmath9 are given in table 2 , along with information on l@xmath9 , distance , and references .",
    "all 16 of the sources for which t@xmath9 can be calculated lie in the class 0 category ( t@xmath15 k ) within error bars .",
    "the mean t@xmath9 is 44 k and the mean l@xmath9 is 5.7 l@xmath3 , excluding the extremely luminous sources iras 20050 and smm1 .",
    "this sample is primarily one of very embedded , low luminosity objects . for two other sources ,",
    "there are enough photometric data to calculate upper limits ( if data are available on the blue side of the peak ) or lower limits ( if data are available on the red side of the peak ) for t@xmath9 .",
    "some of the sources without sufficient data to compute t@xmath9 or l@xmath9 lie in regions of considerably higher luminosity , where confusion prevents separation of the contributions of different sources in the far - infrared .",
    "the method of spectral line asymmetry ( leung & brown 1977 ; zhou 1992 ) was used to identify collapse candidates . an optically thick line in a collapsing core shows a blue asymmetry in the line profile toward the collapse center , while an optically thin line appears symmetric .",
    "the optically thick lines we used were the @xmath1 and @xmath2 transitions of hco@xmath0 , and the optically thin lines were those of rarer isotopomers of hco@xmath0 , like h@xmath5co@xmath0 and hc@xmath16o@xmath0 .",
    "clumpy outflows can also produce peaks that may be either red or blue ; we address the possible confusion between infall and outflow in  4.3 .",
    "observations were made of twenty - three class 0 sources at the 10.4-m telescope of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) at mauna kea , hawaii in 1994 october , 1994 november , 1994 december , 1995 march , 1995 june , 1995 december , and 1996 june .",
    "the sources are listed in table 1 with their celestial coordinates and the off position used for position switching .",
    "the off positions were checked for absence of detectable hco@xmath0 emission .",
    "we used sis receivers operating at 230 and 345 ghz , and the backend was a 1024-channel , acousto - optic spectrometer with a bandwidth of 49.5 mhz . the frequency resolution varied over the five runs from about 2.5 to 3 channels , which corresponds to a velocity resolution of 0.14 to 0.17  at 260 ghz and of 0.10 to 0.12  at 357 ghz .",
    "chopper - wheel calibration was used to obtain the antenna temperature , @xmath17 .",
    "the lines we observed and their frequencies are listed in table 3 along with the main beam efficiency , the velocity resolution , and the beamsize at each frequency .",
    "the efficiencies were calculated from numerous observations of planets .",
    "data from separate runs were resampled to the resolution of the run with the worst frequency resolution before averaging .",
    "a first order baseline was removed before scans were averaged .",
    "seven sources which had noticeable asymmetry ( either to the blue or red side ) at the central position were mapped ( map sizes ranged from 30  by 30  to 60  by 90 ) and observed in at least one transition of h@xmath5co@xmath0 .",

    "five sources showed no asymmetry in both lines .",
    "five other sources were observed only in the @xmath4 line .",
    "of the five sources observed only in the @xmath4 line , three showed no asymmetry , one showed a red asymmetry , and one showed a blue asymmetry .",
    "the line properties are listed in table 4 .",
    "@xmath17 is the highest temperature in the line profile . for singly - peaked lines ,",
    "the velocity and @xmath19v are the centroid and width of the line , found by fitting a single gaussian to the line profile . for lines that have two peaks , we list two values of @xmath17 and velocity , one for each peak , and we give one value for the line width , which is the full width across the spectrum at the temperature where the weaker peak falls to half power .",

    "the resulting output , the density , velocity , kinetic temperature , turbulent width , and x(hco@xmath0 ) at each shell , was then fed into the monte carlo code described by choi et al .",

    "models were also run for a range of distances from 70 pc to 700 pc to check the effect of distance on the observed line profiles , as observed with a beam of fixed angular extent .",
    "the blue / red ratio decreases with distance from as high as 3.52 to as low as 1.59 for our constant abundance model . at 700 pc ,",
    "the line profiles become noticeably asymmetric only at the oldest times .",
    "the linewidth and line strength also decrease with distance .",
    "all of these effects will make collapse harder to detect in more distant clouds of low luminosity .",
    "the more distant sources are often more luminous , and the temperature distribution we used ( appropriate for the average luminosity of our sample ) will underestimate the line strength . because of the dependence on distance , temperature , and abundance , we consider the models presented here only as rough sketches of the evolution of a collapsing cloud .",
    "we can use the models of line profiles to predict the behavior of various quantities with time .",
    "for example , the asymmetry of the line profile can be characterized in various ways .",
    "one is the ratio of the blue peak intensity and the red peak intensity .",
    "the blue / red ratio is plotted versus time in figure 10 for both lines and both models of the abundance .",
    "the blue / red ratio generally increases with time for both models of abundance and both lines , but the values are clearly larger for the model with constant abundance .",
    "thus absolute values of the blue / red ratio can not be used to assign an age without further information on the abundance .    for lines which are not clearly double - peaked",
    ", the blue / red ratio will be undefined , but we can still characterize the asymmetry of the line by a measure like the skewness . the skewness is a non - dimensional quantity defined as the ratio of the third moment of a distribution and the three - halves power of the second moment , both normalized by the first moment .",
    "we calculated the skewness as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the central velocity of the source and @xmath49 is the channel width .",
    "line profiles with a negative skewness have a blue asymmetry , and sources with a positive skewness have a red asymmetry .",
    "the skewness of the model line profiles is also plotted in figure 10 .",
    "the skewness rapidly becomes more negative with time , but eventually reaches a maximum negative value .",
    "we have measured the blue / red ratio and skewness of the observed hco@xmath0 @xmath4 and @xmath1 lines to see how these quantities compare to the model values ( see table 5 ) .",
    "lines with a single peak , even if skewed , or three peaks were assigned a blue / red ratio of one .",
    "skewness was measured in the interval of @xmath48 @xmath23 1.25 . the @xmath48 of the source was calculated from the velocity centroid of the optically thin h@xmath5co@xmath0 line .",
    "this velocity interval was chosen because it covered the central line core for all the sources while excluding as much of the outflow wings as possible .",
    "( changing the velocity interval over which the skewness is measured to 0.95  or 2  causes , at most , a 25% change in the skewness .",
    "the sign is unchanged . )",
    "as can be seen from table 5 and figure 11 , all of the double - peaked blue asymmetric sources , save the hco@xmath0 @xmath1 line in serpens smm2 , have a negative skewness .",
    "one of the two red asymmetric double - peaked sources , l483 , has a positive skewness in @xmath1 and zero skewness in @xmath4 ; and the other , l1448-c , has a negative skewness .",
    "it is possible to have a line with red asymmetry and negative or zero skewness if the line profile displays strong blue wings .    in figure 11 , we plot the skewness versus the blue / red ratio .",
    "the observed sources are represented by pentagons and the models as triangles ( @xmath4 line ) or boxes ( @xmath1 line ) connected by solid or dashed lines , according to the same scheme as in fig .",
    "the good collapse candidates (  4.3 ) are shown as filled pentagons .",
    "the sources with a blue / red ratio greater than unity have negative skewness , as expected .",
    "the @xmath1 lines lie nicely in the region of the models , but many of the @xmath4 lines have larger blue / red ratios than are achieved in the models . in this plot ,",
    "the difference between the two models is small , except that the model with constant abundance extends to much higher blue / red ratios and covers the region with quite a few sources in the @xmath1 line . in fig",
    "12 , we show the blue / red ratio versus the peak line temperature .",
    "this plot reveals another difference between the data and the models : a number of sources have considerably stronger lines than are seen in either model .",
    "the arrow at the right indicates iras 16293 , which lies off the plot .",
    "some of these sources have higher luminosity and consequently higher temperatures than we have modeled ; higher temperatures would produce stronger lines . for the @xmath1 line",
    ", we can imagine that intermediate values of abundance may match the sources with blue / red ratios above two and line strengths greater than 2 k , but the high blue / red ratios in the @xmath4 line may be harder to explain .",
    "this figure also reveals that high peak temperatures and high blue / red ratios are hard to achieve with the models we have run probably because the assumed luminosity is lower than that of many of the sources .",
    "many of the spectra in figures 16 show substantial high velocity wings , which are not produced in the infall models of the last section .",
    "models with faster infall or enhanced abundances of hco@xmath6 in the innermost parts of the infall might produce stronger line wings , but these would be concentrated toward the center of the infall .",
    "maps of the distribution in space of the emission in different velocity ranges can distinguish between infall and bipolar outflow .",
    "the top two panels of figure 13 are integrated intensity maps of one of our infall models . the simulated map , like the actual observations , was made with 15  spacing .",
    "the integrated intensity of the two peaks are centered on the infrared source and the red peak is more compact than the blue peak ( fig . 13 ) .",
    "the emission in the line wings should be very compact .",
    "( the dashed contours are the integrated intensity of the red - shifted peak and the red line wing . ) figure 13 also shows maps of the intensity integrated over different velocity intervals in l1527 .",
    "the integrated blue and red line wing intensities are peaked on either side of the source , indicating that the line wings are due to outflow lobes and are clearly not related to collapse .",
    "the map of the velocity interval corresponding to the blue peak is fairly circular and peaks near the center position , but the red peak is somewhat displaced , indicating some contamination by the outflow .",
    "several other sources ( notably ngc 1333 iras 4a , serpens smm4 , l483 , and l1448-c ) have bipolar outflow emission in hco@xmath6 , based on the maps of the line wings ( figures 13 to 15 ) .",
    "if bipolar outflows dominate the line wings , they might also dominate the peaks . in this case",
    "a high blue / red ratio would not reflect collapse , but rather the relative strength of the two bipolar lobes in the beam centered on the source . in that case",
    ", we might expect an equal number of sources to have stronger red peaks .",
    "considering only the sources with two clearly distinct peaks , there are 7 with stronger blue peaks and 2 with stronger red peaks ; for a sample of nine objects with intrinsically equal probability for either peak to be stronger , the probability is only 0.07 that 7 will have stronger blue peaks .",
    "thus it is unlikely , but not impossible , that the peaks are all caused by outflows .    despite the statistical evidence that not all the double - peaked spectra are caused by outflows ,",
    "the chance of contamination by outflows is serious enough that we do not consider the hco@xmath6 data alone to be sufficient evidence for collapse .",
    "instead we take a blue asymmetry in both hco@xmath6 @xmath1 and @xmath4 as an indication of possible collapse worthy of further investigation . of the nine sources with blue asymmetry , three ( b335 , iras 16293 , and l1527 )",
    "have been previously suggested as collapse candidates , based on other lines . of the other six ,",
    "serpens smm2 can probably be eliminated from consideration because the h@xmath5co@xmath0 @xmath4 line has two velocity components , which have nearly the same velocities as the two peaks of the hco@xmath0 @xmath4 line . for the others",
    ", we can compare the integrated intensity maps of the peaks to those produced by an infall model .",
    "in ngc 1333 iras 4a and 4b , the blue peak is centered on iras 4a , but the red peak increases in intensity to the north . in serpens",
    "smm4 , as in l1527 , the two peaks are separated by about 10  ( fig .",
    "14 ) , in the same direction that the peaks are displaced in the maps of the line wings , suggesting contamination from outflow emission . in hh25mms and",
    "iras 20050 , the maximum of one peak stretches over a larger area than the other peak ( figure 15 ) .",
    "since rotation will also cause a shift of peaks , these sources can not be ruled out as collapse candidates , but more evidence would be needed .",
    "it is noteworthy that both l483 and l1448-c , which have blue / red ratios less than one , have strong bipolarity in the integrated line wing emission ( fig .",
    "15 ) . in l1448-c ,",
    "the blue peak is displaced from the center by about 15 , supporting our earlier suggestion that it is a feature in the outflow . in l483 , the red peak and the blue peak",
    "are displaced about 20  in an east - west direction , as are the peaks in the maps of the line wing emission .",
    "also , in l483 , the peaks are separated in the direction of the outflow .",
    "table 6 is a truth table , which includes information on whether the lines have the correct asymmetry for collapse and whether the h@xmath5co@xmath6 line peaks in the self - absorption dip .",
    "table 6 also includes information on whether the integrated intensity maps of the line peaks are compatible with collapse , with a  n \" indicating that the maps of the line peaks are displaced in a way that suggest they are dominated by outflow .",
    "given the uncertainties described above , we did not make detailed models of all the sources with blue asymmetries .",
    "instead we focused on l1527 , a source with relatively good evidence for collapse ( zhou et al .",
    "1994 , myers et al .",
    "1995 , zhou et al.1996 ) , to see if the hco@xmath6 was consistent with previous models . using the procedure described in  4.1 ,",
    "we have modeled the spectra toward l1527 .",
    "all models had an outer radius of 0.2 pc , a temperature distribution appropriate for the source luminosity ( see  4.1 ) , and constant abundance . by comparing the model profiles to the observed h@xmath5co@xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath4 line profiles",
    ", we constrained the abundance for a range of infall radii . after scaling down the abundance in the h@xmath5co@xmath0 models by a factor of 5 ,",
    "the predicted profiles for the hc@xmath16o@xmath0 @xmath1 line are consistent with our upper limit of 0.07 k. scaling the abundances that fit the h@xmath5co@xmath6 profiles up by factors of 50 or 90 to model hco@xmath0 , we found the model which best matches the observed line profiles , focusing on the inner part of the profiles to avoid the outflow ( figure 16 ) .",
    "this model has a constant abundance of x(hco@xmath0 ) = 2.5@xmath1210@xmath46 , 50 times the abundance of h@xmath5co@xmath6 .",
    "models using 90 for the isotope ratio typically produced worse fits .",
    "the absorption dip is deeper in the model than in the observations , suggesting that a lower abundance in the static envelope would fit better .",
    "we did not pursue this point , to avoid introducing too many parameters .",
    "the best - fit model has an infall radius of 0.026 pc , in agreement with modeling of single - dish h@xmath30co spectra and interferometer data on @xmath5co by zhou et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , but larger than that found by myers et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , r@xmath50 = 0.015 pc , using different h@xmath30co data .",
    "the wings of the observed lines are clearly not produced by an infall model , and we attribute those to outflow as discussed earlier . also , we have noted earlier that the integrated intensity maps of the line peaks show a @xmath5110  displacement between the two peaks in an east - west direction , as do the peaks in the maps of the line wing emission .",
    "although the peak regions of the l1527 spectrum were used to determine the best - fitting model , there is still much excess emission in the peak regions .",
    "this emission is probably contamination from the outflow and contributes to the displacement of the two peaks seen in figure 13 .",
    "note that the large blue / red ratio in the observations is not well - matched by the models , as was also noted by myers et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in their modeling of the h@xmath21co @xmath26 line .",
    "we have surveyed 23 class 0 sources in hco@xmath0 @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "nine sources ( 39% of the sample ) have a blue asymmetry , making them candidates for protostellar collapse .",
    "three sources have a red asymmetry , and one source has different asymmetries in the two lines . the evolutionary progress of a collapsing core was modeled to provide predictions of what line profiles and statistical quantities that characterize them would look like . in general , the model line profiles are similar to the observed line profiles , but they have difficulty reproducing the large blue / red ratios seen in some sources .    hco@xmath0 shows the collapse signature quite well in sources previously identified as collapse candidates . according to chemical models , it may be relatively abundant in collapsing envelopes where other molecules may deplete ( rawlings et al .",
    "1992 ) . however , this molecule has some definite disadvantages .",
    "first , it emits strongly in outflowing gas , confusing collapse signatures .",
    "second , it is a difficult molecule to model because its lines can be quite optically thick . we conclude that it is a good molecule for surveys of possible collapse candidates , because its lines are strong , but confirmation with other molecular lines is needed before collapse can be definitely claimed .    referring to table 6 , we find that b335 , iras 16293 , l1527 ( all previously suggested ) , as well as hh25mms , serpens smm4 , and iras 20050 , are good candidates on all the criteria .",
    "ngc 1333 iras 4a and 4b meet the criteria other than the outflow maps .",
    "serpens smm2 fails the criterion that h@xmath5co@xmath6 peaks in the dip .",
    "we reiterate that these six sources are only collapse _",
    "candidates_. before we can definitely say that protostellar collapse is happening in these sources , further work needs to be done . to strengthen the case for collapse , multi - transition observations are needed in other optically thick molecules like cs and h@xmath21co",

    "<S> the rest have no significant or consistent asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath5co@xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines were also observed to find the velocity of the ambient gas , and sources with an interesting line asymmetry were mapped . </S>",
    "<S> a monte carlo code was used to produce an evolutionary sequence of collapsing cloud models of the hco@xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines and to compare various diagnostics of the resulting line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the same code was used to compare infall models to the observations in one source , l1527 . </S>",
    "<S> the results were consistent with previous collapse models . based on integrated intensity maps of the line peaks and wings , as well as the velocity of the h@xmath5co@xmath0 line , we select six of the nine sources with a blue line asymmetry as good _ candidates _ for protostellar collapse . </S>",
    "<S> further evidence is needed to establish that infall is taking place . </S>",
    "<S> the hco@xmath6 spectra are not conclusive because bipolar outflows produce strong emission , which can confuse the issue in any individual source </S>",
