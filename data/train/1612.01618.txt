    "<S> the choice of the 50th trial was arbitrary ; any other choice would have also produced a valid analysis . to enable this choice </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the 50th trial does not depend on the earlier trials in each block . collisions between ions and background gases can cause the ions to overheat or be ejected from the potential well . to reduce the consequences of these effects , we checked the status of the ions with fluorescence measurements . </S>",
    "<S> if the measurements made prior to the beginning of each trial do not detect a problem with the ions , that trial was `` heralded '' and included in the analysis ( see supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> because we use only information gained prior to the beginning of a trial to herald that trial , the detection loophole is not opened . when studying the 50th trial of each block , 1,361 trials were therefore analyzed .    </S>",
    "<S> a memory - robust statistical framework is formulated to infer a bound on the maximum local content in the observed correlation . for @xmath81 , we draw inferences based on the statistic @xmath108 , defined as @xmath109 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the measurement outcomes from the two ions when they are measured with settings @xmath34 chosen from eq . </S>",

    "<S> the expectation value of @xmath110 is @xmath112 , so intuitively larger values of @xmath113 should correspond to a lower local fraction @xmath4 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ localandnonlocal ] ) . in the presence of memory effects , it is possible for the proportion of local states to change over time </S>",
    "<S> . hence we model each trial @xmath45 as having a probability @xmath114 of generating a local state , and derive a one - sided @xmath115 confidence interval @xmath116 $ ] for @xmath117 , the minimum local content that can occur over the course of the experiment . </S>",

    "<S> the values of @xmath130 and @xmath121 obtained when we analyzed the 1st through 100th trial in each block , representing the @xmath131 estimates and confidence intervals that would have been obtained with a different choice of representative trial , are shown in the supplemental material . when all data from the heralded trials is analyzed together , @xmath130 is determined to be 0.315(5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> an associated confidence interval for local content would be valid only with additional assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the settings in each block are not random after the first . if the trials in each block were i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> , then one could use all 100 trials to create a confidence interval for local content . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our experiments the trials are not fully i.i.d .    </S>",
