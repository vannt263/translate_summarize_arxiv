    "according to the standard inflationary cosmology @xcite , the formation of structure in the universe starts from small amplitude density perturbations generated by the fluctuations of scalar fields during the inflation epoch .",
    "the initial perturbations then subsequently develop through gravitational instability .",
    "such a mechanism generally produces adiabatic perturbations with a roughly scale - invariant fluctuation spectrum possessing an index @xmath5@xcite .",
    "that is , the power spectrum of the primordial density perturbations can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the comoving wavenumber , and @xmath8 .",
    "the tiny temperature anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are basically consistent with this scenario@xcite .",
    "however , the first two years of the cosmic microwave explorer ( cobe ) differential microwave radiometer ( dmr ) observations on the cmb temperature fluctuation have found the lack of perturbations on scales larger than @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hubble constant @xcite .",
    "namely , there is a lack of power in the spectrum of the initial density perturbations on length scales equal to or larger than the hubble radius @xmath11 .",
    "more recently , both @xmath12 and likelihood analyses of the cobe - dmr 2-year and 4-year sky maps found that the cmb temperature fluctuations can be fitted by models with power spectrum as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15@xcite .",
    "obviously , the factor @xmath16 $ ] implies the suppression of density perturbations on scales larger than hubble radius , @xmath17 .",
    "the super - hubble suppression is difficult to conform with the purely adiabatic ( isentropic ) initial perturbations of scalar field @xmath18 of the standard inflation . in the framework of inflation ,",
    "a possible mechanism of the super - hubble suppression is the multi - component inflation scenarios .",
    "the initial perturbations produced by such models are hybrid , i.e. they contain both adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the behaviors of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations are qualitatively different on super - horizon scales .",
    "principally , isocurvature fluctuations in the super - horizon region will give rise to isothermal perturbations , which do not contribute to density perturbations on super - hubble scales .",
    "yet , when the isothermal perturbations enter the hubble horizon , they will become density perturbations .",
    "thus , if the initial perturbations are hybrid , the perturbations shall show an amplitude enhancement at scale @xmath19 .",
    "in other words , the hybrid perturbations at super - hubble scales are suppressed .    in the current pool of inflation models ,",
    "many of them are of multi - component .",
    "it includes double and variant multiple inflation@xcite , bulk viscous cosmology@xcite , hidden sector of supersymmetry inflation@xcite , etc",
    ". however , the initial entropy fluctuations may not survive or significantly be reduced due to the post - inflationary reheating which is essentially a process of entropy production and thermalization .",
    "therefore , multi - component inflations may not be sufficient to explain , or to quantify the super - hubble suppression if a reheating is necessary .",
    "accordingly , to settle the issue of the super - hubble suppression , a multi - component inflation without reheating is preferred .    from the studies of the system consisting of a scalar field and thermal bath , it has been realized that two components , the scalar field and the thermal bath , can coexist during inflation@xcite .",
    "therefore , the mass density perturbations from the inflation with thermal dissipation should be hybrid perturbations . moreover , analytic and numerical solutions of this model illustrated that the radiation component increases continuously and smoothly during the inflation epoch , and there is no post - inflationary reheating@xcite .",
    "therefore , the hybrid perturbations generated during inflation can survive the cosmic inflation and imprint on the subsequent evolution .",
    "recently it was found that this model can fit in with the amplitude and index of the power spectrum of the observed cmb temperature fluctuations if the mass of inflaton , @xmath20 , is taken to be @xmath21 gev@xcite .",
    "thus , it is worth examining whether the observed supper - hubble suppression also corresponds to this model with the same parameters .",
    "the goal of this paper is to calculate the super - hubble evolution of hybrid perturbations , and then the super - hubble suppression for inflation model with significant thermal dissipation . because the super - hubble or super - horizon evolution is relativistic in nature",
    ", the super - hubble suppression must be obtained using a full relativistic analysis .",

    "let us briefly introduce the model of inflation with thermal dissipation .",
    "the details have been described in @xcite . consider a flat universe consisting of a scalar field @xmath18 , the inflaton , and a thermal bath .",
    "the equations of the expanding universe are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 represents the adiabatic index of thermal radiation , @xmath25 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath26 is the cosmic scale factor . the effective potential for the @xmath18-field is denoted by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the energy density of the thermal bath .",
    "the equation of motion for the scalar field @xmath18 is @xcite @xmath29 the induction of the friction term @xmath30 represents a possible approximation for the dissipation of @xmath18 field in a heat bath environment in near - equilibrium circumstances .",
    "accordingly it describes the interaction between the @xmath18 field and the thermal component . in principle",
    ", @xmath2 can be a function of @xmath18 . in the cases of polynomial interactions between @xmath18 field and bath environment",
    ", one may take the polynomial of @xmath18 for @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the friction coefficient must be positive definite , hence @xmath32 , and the dissipative index of friction @xmath33 should be zero or even integer if @xmath27 is invariant under the transformation @xmath34 .    for a uniform field , or the background @xmath18 , the term @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) can be ignored , and we have @xmath36 in the case of slow - rolling , eq.(2.4 ) yields @xmath37    the equation of the radiation component ( thermal bath ) is given by the first law of thermodynamics as @xmath38 the temperature of the thermal bath is related to the radiation energy density by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the effective number of degrees of freedom at temperature @xmath41 .",
    "the warm inflation epoch is defined when the temperature of the thermal bath is larger than the hawking temperature , i.e. @xmath42 since the thermal and the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field @xmath18 are proportional to @xmath41 and @xmath3 respectively , eq . ( 2.7 ) indicates that during the warm inflation epoch , the thermal fluctuations dominate over the quantum fluctuations",
    ".    equation ( 2.7 ) is also necessary for maintaining the thermal equilibrium of the radiation component . in general ,",
    "the time scale for the relaxation of a radiation bath is shorter for higher temperature .",
    "accordingly , to have the relaxation time of the bath be shorter than the expansion time scale of the universe , a temperature higher than @xmath3 is needed .    for a @xmath43 potential , e.g. @xmath44 with @xmath45 ,",
    "the background solution of the @xmath18 field is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , the planck mass @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the initial value of the scalar field .",

    "1 . the hubble parameter , @xmath55 [ eq . ( 2.2 ) ] , remains constant during the inflation .",
    "this is the same as in the standard slow - roll inflation model . at the end of inflation @xmath56",
    ", the hubble parameter @xmath55 evolves from @xmath57 constant to a radiation regime @xmath58 . in the range of @xmath59 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath60 , the solution is unphysical , because it is impossible to maintain the thermalization of the heat bath with the temperature less than the hawking temperature @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the warm inflation epoch is specified by the period of @xmath61 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the inflation smoothly exits to a radiation era at @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "there is no reheating epoch in this model .",
    "one can calculate the evolution of density perturbations from the slow - rolling era to radiation era without the interruption of reheating .",
    "this is especially important for the primordial entropic or isocurvature fluctuations because the post - inflationary reheating is generally a thermalization process with a time scale less than @xmath64 , thus it may smooth away initial entropic fluctuations , and even the initial isocurvature perturbation can not survive the reheating .",
    "to describe a perturbed universe , we employ the so - called gauge - specific formalism @xcite .",
    "the matter distribution is described by a normalized 4-velocity vector @xmath65 at each point of space - time , i.e. @xmath66 ( the latin indices run from 1 to 4 , and the greek indices from 1 to 3 ) . at each point , a projection into the rest space of an observer moving with @xmath65 can be made by a projection tensor defined as @xmath67 .",
