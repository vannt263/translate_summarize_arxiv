    "since the birth of the yukawa theory of the nuclear force in 1935 it was a challenge for the physics community to determine the coupling strength of the yukawa meson to the nucleon . in 1947",
    "the meson  pion  was finally discovered in cosmic ray emulsion experiments @xcite and more systematic work to determine the @xmath0nn coupling constant could start .",
    "conventionally @xcite the pseudoscalar strength is denoted by @xmath1 and the pseudovector coupling constant by @xmath2 such that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the charged pion mass and @xmath5 is the proton mass .",
    "other conventions concerning the nucleon mass and the factor @xmath6 appear in the literature @xcite .",
    "reasonable estimates for the coupling strength were obtained even before the discovery of the pion and without detailed knowledge of the meson mass , e.g. , bethe was able to get an estimate @xmath7 = 0.077 - 0.080 already in 1940 @xcite on the basis of deuteron properties .",
    "the results of various determinations until 1980 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the same figure",
    "very different techniques to determine @xmath7 are summarized . in the previous _ menu _",
    "symposium de swart gave a review on the topic @xcite and many of the references used in fig .",
    "1 can be found there .",
    "the values of @xmath7 stabilized for a long time @xcite and only in the 90 s has the discussion of the value of the pion - nucleon coupling constant started again . in @xcite fixed-@xmath8",
    "dispersion relations for @xmath0n were used . in the determinations displayed in fig",
    ". 1 most of the data date back to the era before the meson factories , lampf , sin and triumf , which , in addition to performing experiments with pions , had programmes to study the nn interaction .    in several analyses shown in fig .",
    "2 nn scattering data have been used to extract the @xmath0n coupling strength , i.e. one of the standard methods until the 60 s has been adopted again in more refined form . in this activity",
    "the nijmegen group has played an important role @xcite . of course , in fig .",
    "2 many results from the meson factory @xmath0n experiments are included as well in the data bases used to determine @xmath7 .",
    "the central issue in the discussion in the working group has been the scatter of the results of the determinations as shown in fig .",
    "the main questions involve the model dependence of different techniques , the effect of different pieces of data ( partly conflicting ) , the error estimates , the electromagnetic corrections and other isospin violating effects . in the working group contributions",
    "were presented by loiseau @xcite , hhler @xcite and pavan @xcite , and brief commentaries by w.r .",
    "gibbs , m. birse and d.v . bugg .",
    "the particular issues raised in the discussion include :    * electromagnetic corrections : * * @xmath0n vs. nn ; the different treatment of electromagnetic corrections for these two scattering processes gives a possibility to check the uncertainty due to these effects * * corrections from tromborg et al .",
    "@xcite vs. oades et al .",
    "@xcite ; the dispersion approach and potential model lead to differences which need checking * * corrections at high energy ; these need to be checked , tromborg et al .",
    "calculated corrections only up to 655 mev / c * lack of transparency of the analyses ; the analyses contain large data bases and it is hard to clarify which pieces of information are the crucial ones in determining @xmath7 * the normalization of the @xmath9 data is a problem in the @xmath10 data analyses * the determination of the s - wave isoscalar scattering length , @xmath11 , from the @xmath12 level shift measurement suffers from some model dependence due to electromagnetic and absorption corrections * effective theory is not at present suitable for fixing the coupling constant .",
    "the problems relate mostly to the convergence of the chiral expansion or to the additional low - energy constants which are not known accurately enough .",
    "however , there might be a chance in a precise measurement of the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant , @xmath13 , which would make an accurate determination of the pion - nucleon coupling constant possible @xcite * there is need for a new fixed-@xmath8 analysis of @xmath0n scattering data which extends beyond the present limit of the vpi analysis , 2.1 gev * there is need for a new analysis of the forward dispersion relations of the nn system .",
    "the amount of nn data has increased considerably since the previous analysis thanks to the meson factories and saturne .",
    "the goldberger - miyazawa - oehme sum rule ( gmo ) @xcite provides a simple means to estimate the pion - nucleon coupling constant directly from measurable quantities , the @xmath0n isovector s - wave scattering length and total cross sections from the threshold to the highest energies .",
    "the method still has uncertainties , and will probably never be able to compete with other methods in precision , but the advantage is the possibility to relate the uncertainty in @xmath7 directly to the experimental errors .",
    "the gmo sum rule is the result of the forward dispersion relation for the @xmath14 amplitude taken at the physical threshold ( the total laboratory energy @xmath15 ) @xmath16 } + 4 \\pi m_\\pi j^-   = 4 \\pi ( 1+x ) a^-_{0 + } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the pion - nucleon coupling constant can now be extracted and the result is @xmath19 [ ( 1+x ) m_\\pi a^-_{0 + } - m_\\pi^2 j^- ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 0.5712 ( m_\\pi \\ , a^-_{0 + } ) -0.02488 ( j^-/{\\rm mb}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the isovector s - wave scattering length , @xmath20 , is accessible through experiment @xcite . for the integral @xmath21",
    "several evaluations are displayed in table 1 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3 there is potential sensitivity to details of the electromagnetic corrections especially around the @xmath22-resonance region near 0.3 gev / c as well as to the treatment of the @xmath23 , @xmath24 splitting .",
    ".values for the @xmath21 integral .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the table demonstrates the current trend , the favoured value for @xmath7 is slightly smaller than the standard one of koch and pietarinen @xcite .",
    "however , there remains still quite a number of problems which need attention .",
    "the goldberger - treiman discrepancy @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the pion and neutron decay constants respectively , would be reduced from 4 % to 2 % , if @xmath7 changes from 0.079 to 0.076 . in a recent su(3 )",
    "analysis @xcite preference for a smaller goldberger - treiman discrepancy was found .    in the analysis of @xmath9 scattering data at backward directions",
    "somewhat higher value for the coupling constant has been obtained @xcite , @xmath7 = 0.0803 @xmath28 0.0014 .",
    "discussion on the problems in this field continues @xcite .",
    "the spin transfer coefficients in @xmath29 scattering are also of interest , the preliminary indications are towards slightly smaller value for the coupling @xcite .",
    "machleidt has recently discussed @xcite some additional problems with the deuteron properties and low - energy nn analyzing powers which indicate that no coherent picture is yet emerging .",
