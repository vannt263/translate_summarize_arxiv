    "decay is one of the oldest topics in quantum theory .",
    "it describes the escape by tunneling of particles from a certain region .",
    "in addition to the wave function itself , two quantities of interest are the survival and the nonescape probabilities .",
    "as time evolves , the former is defined as the probability that a decaying particle remains in its original state and the latter as the probability that the decaying particle remains within the interaction potential .    in this work , the wave function for the decay of two identical non interacting particles is obtained both as a discrete expansion involving the full set of complex poles ( and resonant states ) of the outgoing green s function to the problem and also as a discrete expansion that includes proper complex poles plus an integral contribution which is more appropriate to study the long - time behavior .",
    "the above approaches have been used into the description of single - particle decay @xcite . there , in general , one finds , after an ultrashort non exponential contribution , an exponential decaying regime that depends on a single dominant resonance term followed at long times by an inverse power law as @xmath2 ( @xmath0 wave symmetrical potentials ) @xcite .",
    "the short and long - time nonexponential regimes have been experimentally verified in recent years @xcite .",
    "the escape behavior of identical particles is of interest , particularly since recent studies have shown that the pauli exclusion principle has consequences upon the particular power law obeyed in the free time evolution ( no potential ) of identical particles confined initially in a finite region of space @xcite . the decay of a few - body tonks - girardeu gas has also been studied in this context by considering an integration over all the coordinates of the particles but one .",
    "there , it was also found an inverse - power law proportional to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the approach followed here considers both the survival and nonescape probabilities as truly multiparticle observable quantities and as such the integrations will be all done in one single step .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ formalism ] reviews succinctly the formalism of resonant states , in particular regarding the time evolution of single - particle decay .",
    "section [ two particles ] provides a derivation of exact expressions for the time evolution of decay of two identical particles as a resonance expansion in terns of moshinsky functions , both for _ factorized symmetric _ and _ symmetric / antisymmetric _ states and introduces the two - particle expressions for the survival and nonescape probabilities .",
    "section [ ws ] discusses a model calculation involving the @xmath0 wave @xmath1 shell potential which involves analytical expressions for the two - particle solutions both along the exponential and long - time nonexponential regimes .",
    "finally , section [ remarks ] provides the concluding remarks .",
    "consider a single particle confined at @xmath3 along the internal region of a real spherically symmetrical finite - range potential , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "for simplicity we consider @xmath0 waves and choose as units @xmath6 .",
    "the solution to the time - dependent schrdinger equation in the radial variable @xmath7 , as an initial value problem , may be written at time @xmath8 in terms of the retarded green s function @xmath9 of the problem as @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the arbitrary state initially confined within the internal interaction region . in what follows , for the sake of the simplicity of the discussion",
    ", we refer to potentials that do not support bound and antibound states",
    ". a convenient form of the retarded time - dependent green s function is expressed in terms of the outgoing green s function @xmath12 of the problem .",
    "both quantities are related by a laplace transformation where the bromwich contour corresponds to a hyperbolic contour along the first quadrant of the @xmath13 plane @xcite which may be evaluated by deforming the integration contour from @xmath14 to @xmath15 along the imaginary @xmath13 axis .",
    "this allows us to write the retarded green s function as @xcite @xmath16 where the sum extends over the complex poles of the problem , the notation @xmath17 means that the point @xmath18 is excluded in the above expansion ( otherwise it diverges ) and the function @xmath19 , the so called moshinsky function , is defined as @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , and the function @xmath23 stands for the faddeyeva or complex error function @xcite for which there exist efficient computational tools @xcite . the functions @xmath24 in ( [ eq : g_exact ] ) correspond to the so called resonant states ( also known as quasinormal modes ) which are solutions to the schrdinger equation of the problem obeying purely outgoing boundary conditions which imply that the corresponding energy eigenvalues are complex , _ i.e. _ , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 yields the resonance energy of the decaying fragment and @xmath27 stands for the resonance width , which yields the lifetime @xmath28 of a given resonance level .",
    "the lifetime of the system is defined by the longest lifetime , _",
    "i.e. _ , the shortest width . the complex poles @xmath29 are distributed along the third and fourth quadrants of the complex @xmath13 plane in a well known manner @xcite .    for proper poles , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30 , eq . ( [ eq : g_exact ] ) may be written alternatively , using some properties of the faddeyeva function , as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 , \\label{ine}\\ ] ] and we recall that @xmath33 .",
    "since the potential is real , it follows from time - reversal invariance that @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the last term in ( [ eq : exp_prop ] ) becomes relevant both at ultrashort and asymptotic long times @xcite .",
    "the description of ultrashort times is more involved and will not be considered here since it possibly requires different considerations .",
    "there is another route to analyze the long - time behavior of @xmath9 which follows by closing the bromwich contour mentioned above along a straight line @xmath36 that is @xmath37 off the real axis and goes through the origin @xcite .",
    "the resulting expression , that is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ ine ] ) , reads @xmath38 it turns out that this integral term may be evaluated at long times by the steepest descent method as it has a saddle point at @xmath39 and hence one may perform a taylor expansion of @xmath40 around that value to evaluate the integral @xcite . thus , alternatively , at long times , the retarded propagator may also be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "for decay of a single particle it suffices to take @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : desarr_prop_g_asint ] ) .",
    "however , already for two particles , higher values of @xmath46 are required , as discussed below .",
    "in the case of a system of identical non interacting particles , it is known that the hamiltonian @xmath47 must be symmetric under the permutation of the indices of the particles so the exchange operator and @xmath47 necessarily commute .",
    "thus , it is enough to impose the appropriate symmetry / antisymmetry on the initial state @xmath48 since symmetry is conserved as time evolves .",
    "hence , the time evolution for decay of two identical particles may be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote , respectively , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    a simple choice , which corresponds to a symmetric state , is given by the product of single particle states @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 denoting the state , @xmath57 substitution of ( [ fac_sim ] ) and ( [ eq : g_exact ] ) into ( [ eq : psi_2_parts ] ) yields the _ factorized symmetric _",

    "it is worth recalling that the coefficients @xmath71 , which involve only single - particle states , fulfill the relationship @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is defined as ( [ coefs ] ) with @xmath74 substituted by @xmath75 .",
    "hence for real initial states , @xmath76 .",
    "although the @xmath77 are complex and its real part may be negative , they play a most relevant role in time - dependent expansions as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
