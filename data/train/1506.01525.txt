    "since the discovery of heavy - fermion materials , the underlying mechanism controlling these rare earth or actinide - based compounds has continuously been the focuses of exploration @xcite . in these materials , the strong coupling limit of the on - site kondo spin exchange causes the kondo screening ( ks ) of local moments by the conduction electrons , yielding a kondo paramagnetic ( kp ) phase . on the other hand , in the weak coupling limit , the kondo coupling generates an indirect ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction among the local moments , resulting in either antiferromagnetism ( afm ) around the half - filling of the conduction electrons , or ferromagnetism ( fm ) far away from half - filling  doniach77,lacroix79 .",
    "however , in the intermediate kondo coupling region , the competition between ks and magnetic correlation may produce a coexisting ( ce ) phase with afm and ks near half - filling  @xcite .",
    "the ce phase or so - called heavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase ( hfafm ) has been observed in cecoge@xmath5si@xmath6  @xcite , and ce@xmath7pd@xmath8si@xmath9  @xcite , etc . in ce@xmath7pd@xmath10si@xmath9 , the hfafm",
    "is observed within the magnetically ordered phase , indicating the separation of two transitions , i.e. , the breakdown of kondo screening effect and concomitant fermi surface reconstruction ( fsr ) which happens between hfafm and pure afm , and the magnetic transition which occurs between hfafm and kp phase  @xcite .",
    "however , studies of hall coefficient and pressure effect in ybrh@xmath11si@xmath11 have shown that the kondo breakdown occurs precisely at the magnetic transition , while under co and ir doping , two transitions separate  @xcite .",
    "the kondo breakdown also occurs away from the magnetic transition in cein@xmath7 and cerh@xmath12co@xmath6in@xmath13  @xcite .    to understand the novel behavior of the phase transitions in these materials , the corresponding parameter region and the feature of the afm phase",
    ", ce phase , kp phase have been investigated within the framework of the kondo lattice model ( klm ) or kondo heisenberg lattice model , and intensively studied at zero temperature by mean - field approximation , variational monte carlo calculations , gutzwiller approximation , etc  zhang00,capponi01,watanabe07,martin08,fabrizio08,fabrizio13 . at half - filling limit",
    ", the reconstruction of the energy bands leads to an insulating state , and the ground state phases were computed with varying kondo coupling @xcite .",
    "away from half - filling , the phase transitions are discussed by mean - field approximation on the kondo heisenberg lattice model , and the shift from onset to offset between the kondo breakdown and magnetic transition is proposed to be driven by the change of the heisenberg exchange and the ratio of short and long - range hopping strength  @xcite .    actually , the ground state phases and their features are controlled by the kondo coupling @xmath0 , the electron occupy number @xmath1 and the electron hopping strength .",
    "however , the phase evolutions with these parameters have not been fully explored yet , particularly how these phases evolute with @xmath14 and long - distance electron hoping remains an open issue  lacroix79,fabrizio13 . in order to deal with this issue",
    ", we adopt the slave - fermion mean - field technique on the klm , and developed a more efficient theory to calculate the phase boundaries between various phases .",
    "we show that the relative positions of kondo breakdown and magnetic transition can be shifted by both @xmath1 and @xmath15 on the @xmath1-@xmath16 plane .",
    "as @xmath1 decreases , two transitions get closer and then coincide . this @xmath1-generating offset - to - onset structure with a triple point in the phase diagram",
    "is related to the experimental observations of ce@xmath17pd@xmath18si@xmath9 and ybrh@xmath11si@xmath11 under doping .    on the other hand , most of earlier works focused on the ground state , while detailed theoretical studies at finite temperatures are still lacking . in the case",
    "when the occupation number of the conduction electron @xmath1 is far away from half - filling , the coexisting phase of fm and ks has investigated at finite temperatures and the phase diagram has been derived  @xcite . remarkably , the boundaries separating the various phases joint to a single point on the @xmath0-@xmath4 plane , so an interesting issue arises as to whether the half - filled kondo lattice system possesses similar feature in the finite temperature phase diagram .",
    "therefore , we devote to study the ground state and finite - temperature phase diagram of the kondo lattice model at and away from half - filling , attempting to give a detailed description of the evolution of the various phases with the kondo coupling , the conduction electron occupy number , the electron hopping strength and temperature . to this end , a modified mean - field decoupling technique for the kondo interaction is employed , then the phase diagrams are obtained as functions of @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath15 , and @xmath4 .",
    "our method turns out to give a compact description of the phase diagrams at both zero and finite temperatures .",
    "we consider the spin-1/2 kondo lattice model on a two - dimensional square lattice with @xmath19 sites , @xmath20where @xmath21 is the dispersion of conduction electrons , which interact with local moments through antiferromagnetic kondo exchange @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denotes the chemical potential .",

    "the kondo interaction can be decomposed into @xmath29where the first term represents the kondo singlet screening effect and the other three terms describe the triplet parings between conduction electrons and slave fermion holes .",
    "this expression captures su(2 ) invariance of the kondo coupling .    in order to describe the antiferromagnetism in the kondo lattice model ,",
    "two afm order parameters @xmath30are introduced to decouple the longitudinal kondo spin exchange coupling @xcite , where @xmath31 is the afm vector .",
    "then the total staggered magnetization is expressed by @xmath32 . to characterize the ks in the presence of afm long - range ordering , two different hybridization parameters on each magnetic sublattice a and b have to be introduced @xcite @xmath33the conventional hybridization parameter",
    "is expressed as @xmath34while the staggered hybridization parameter is defined by @xmath35which requires the breaking of particle - hole symmetry of the conduction electrons , i.e. , @xmath36 , or @xmath37 .",
    "it is seen that the singlet channel hybridizes the @xmath38- and @xmath39-fermions with the same wave vector , while the longitudinal exchange brings a momentum transfer @xmath40 within both @xmath38- and @xmath39-fermions , resulting in the staggered triplet channel .",
    "the local lagrangian constraint is replaced by a uniform one : @xmath41 .",

    "this result indicates that the ce phase region reduces with decreasing @xmath1 and finally disappears at a triple point . as @xmath1 decreases further , the afm and kp phases are separated by a first - order transition at @xmath204 , at which the afm and kp phase shares equal energy .",

    "this offset - to - onset transition between kondo breakdown and magnetic transition as @xmath1 decreases may account for the experimental observations for cein@xmath7 and cerh@xmath12co@xmath6in@xmath13  @xcite , and ybrh@xmath11si@xmath11 under co and ir doping and external pressure  @xcite .",
    "the triple point ( @xmath209 ) in our phase diagram can be shifted by @xmath210 , so in our mechanism this offset - to - onset transition can also be generated by varying @xmath210 , similar to that proposed in ref .",

    "experimental studies of the existence of @xmath189 may be particularly interesting .",
    "the kp phase possesses larger fermi surface than afm phases , consequently , the transition from afm to kp at @xmath204 when @xmath208 may induce a abrupt change of hall coefficient as in ybrh@xmath11si@xmath11 , where the fsr was observed via hall effect at the onset of magnetic transition  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have performed an optimized mean - field decoupling of the kondo lattice model near half - filling at both zero and finite temperatures .",
    "in addition to the pure afm phase in weak kondo coupling range and the kondo paramagnetic phase in relatively strong coupling range , a distinct phase coexisting afm order with kondo hybridization arises in the intermediate kondo exchange region , and the ground state phase diagram has been determined as function of the kondo coupling , electron concentration and electron hopping .",
    "in particular , for the coexisting phase , we found a finite staggered triplet hybridization between local moments and conduction electrons .",
    "we also develop an efficient method to calculate the phase boundaries .",
    "the characteristic parameters and fermi surface structures of these phases and the phase transitions between them have been discussed explicitly . we have further found a mechanism explaining the offset - to - onset transition between kondo breakdown and magnetic transition , which is driven by the decreasing of electron number @xmath1 .",
    "this mechanism may account for the separation of the two transitions in ybrh@xmath11si@xmath211 under doping , and the existence of triple point ( @xmath212 ) in the phase diagram deserves deep experimental investigation . at half - filling limit , a finite - temperature phase diagram has been determined on @xmath0-@xmath4 plane . as temperature rises , the region of this coexisting phase diminishes continuously then finally converges to a single point , together with the pure afm phase and kp phase , which may require further theoretical and experimental verification .",
