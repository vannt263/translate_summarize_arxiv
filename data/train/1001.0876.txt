    "because stars are well - spaced , even the inner parts of galaxies can appear faint , comparable in surface brightness to the darkest of night skies . not surprisingly , then , when we start exploring the full six - dimensional phase space of velocities and positions that stars occupy in galaxies , the signal per phase space element becomes almost vanishingly small . in the case of the milky way ,",
    "for example , the fascinating stellar streams in the halo @xcite have widths of only @xmath0 , and velocity dispersions of maybe @xmath1 .",
    "if we were to divide the galaxy , with a linear dimension of @xmath2 and velocities spanning @xmath3 , into resolution elements this small , we would end up with @xmath4 of them , many more than there are stars in the milky way , so the average occupation number per element would be very small indeed .",
    "thus , if we are to study the detailed kinematics of galaxies , we need to do two things .",
    "first , we must be able to detect stellar populations at extremely low phase densities , which essentially means detecting individual stars .",
    "second , we need to come up with ways to combine the information from these individual detections in order to bring together enough signal to say anything about the properties of the galaxy , and hence reconstruct its detailed dynamical structure in order to learn about its evolution .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) offer an ideal tracer of such faint stellar populations , as they are readily individually detectable from their emission lines , even in quite distant galaxies , and the doppler shifts in these lines can be used to measure their line - of - sight velocities .",
    "to make such measurements efficiently in a single step , we have designed and built a customized instrument , the planetary nebula spectrograph or pn.s @xcite . in this paper , we present examples from a couple of the projects that we have been undertaking with this instrument , to illustrates the principles of investigating galaxies in the ultimate low - density regime of phase space .",
    "when one traces edge - on stellar disks away from the plane out to very low surface brightnesses , an excess of light above the extrapolation of the normal disk population is frequently found @xcite .",
    "the nature of such `` thick disks '' remains highly controversial : they could just be the extreme tail of the normal disk population , or they could represent some more dramatic event , such as the debris from a merger .",
    "one exciting new clue to help distinguish between these possibilities was uncovered when it was found that the thick disk in the edge - on system fgc  227 appears to be rotating in the opposite direction to the normal thin - disk population , indicating that it would have to be a distinct component such as might be formed in a merger @xcite .",
    "however , the surface brightness of this component is so faint that , even with ten hours of integration on an 8-metre telescope , conventional spectroscopy had such large error bars that the data were also consistent with co - rotating thin and thick disks .",
    "[ fig : ngc891 ]    as figure  [ fig : ngc891 ] illustrates , we can do a great deal better with a rather shorter integration on a 4-metre telescope using pn.s .",
    "the upper panel shows the number counts of pne detected in the edge - on spiral ngc  891 as a function of distance from its plane .",
    "the lines show a possible decomposition of the disk into thin and thick exponential components @xcite .",
    "the data drop below the model close to the plane , as pne are difficult to detect against the high surface brightness of the galaxy in this region , and some pne will also be lost in ngc  891 s strong dust lane . however , in the region we are interested in away from the plane , the pn number counts trace the light distribution very well , underlining their nature as generic tracers of the stellar population .",
    "further , we are clearly detecting them in significant numbers out to beyond the transition where the thick disk becomes the dominant component .",
    "the lower panel in this figure shows the observed mean rotation speed for these pne as a function of distance from the plane .",
    "there is plenty of signal to distinguish between co- and counter - rotating thin and thick disk components , and in this system the two are clearly rotating in the same direction . indeed , we can go further and fit a simple single - component kinematic model to the data .",
    "this heuristic model is of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 provides the factor that allows for the line - of - sight projection effects that reduce the line - of - sight velocity below the mean rotational velocity @xcite , while @xmath7 parameterizes all the terms related to the shape of the velocity ellipsoid in the asymmetric drift equation @xcite ; here it is assumed to be a constant .",
    "the circular speed of the galaxy , @xmath8 , can be inferred from gas kinematics , while the vertical velocity dispersion , @xmath9 , is estimated by solving the jeans equation for a self - gravitating sheet whose density distribution is given by the double exponential model in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : ngc891 ] .",
    "clearly , the data are essentially consistent with this simple single - component model : there is no kinematic evidence that the thick disk in ngc  891 is in any way a distinct entity .",
    "as a further illustration of the way in which faint kinematic components can be detected , figure  [ fig : m31 ] shows the results of an analysis of the 2615 pne that were found using pn.s in a survey of m31 @xcite . in an inclined disk system like this , the phase space is essentially reduced to four dimensions , two spatial and two velocity .",
    "we can measure three of these components , two spatial and the line - of - sight velocity , so each pn has only one unknown coordinate .",
    "thus , while one can not measure the energy and angular momentum of any single pn , there is only a one - dimensional family of possibilities , as illustrated by the line sections in the figure .",
    "if group of pne share a common orbit ( and hence energy and angular momentum ) , then their lines will all intersect at a single point , creating a local excess in this plane .",
    "such an excess of crossing lines is , indeed , found in this figure , at the point indicated by the box .",
    "the location of the orbit to which it corresponds does not appear in any way special in an optical image of m31 , but , as the inset image in the figure shows , mid - infrared data reveal a bright ring of emission at this radius , indicating that it lies at one of the major orbital resonances .",
    "thus , either we have detected the population of stars born in this ring of star formation , or , more likely since pne come from old stars , we are picking out the relatively small population of objects that have become dynamically trapped at this resonance .",
    "whatever their origin , these data again illustrate the power of pn.s to identify kinematic components that are at far too low a density in phase space to be detectable by more conventional means .",
