    "much as circles can be embedded in @xmath0 , giving rise to knots and links , surfaces can be embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "knotted surfaces can be studied diagrammatically via a projection ( diagram ) in @xmath0 .",
    "such a diagram can be cut by planes that are perpendicular to a fixed direction in the 3-space of the projection , giving rise to a movie description for a knotted surface .",
    "carter and saito  @xcite found a set of fifteen moves , called _ movie moves _ , such that two movies represent isotopic knotted surfaces if and only if there is a finite sequence of moves from this set or interchanges of the levels of distant critical points that takes one to the other .",
    "the result in  @xcite generalizes roseman s set of seven moves  @xcite , which are moves on projections where a height function has not been specified in the 3-space of the projection , and are analogous to reidemeister moves for classical link diagrams .",
    "singular links are embeddings of 4-valent graphs in @xmath0 considered up to rigid - vertex isotopies , and are interesting objects which enrich the field of knot theory . for rigid - vertex isotopies",
    "we refer the reader to kauffman s work  @xcite .",
    "we can go one dimension higher to consider cobordisms of singular links and study them up to ambient isotopy relative to boundary .",
    "we say that two singular links are cobordant if one can be obtained from the other by singular link isotopy and morse transformations .",
    "analogous to knotted surfaces and , more generally , knot / link cobordisms , singular link cobordisms can be studied diagrammatically using their projections in 3-space or by their movie representations .",
    "one then may desire to have at hand a set of reidemeister - type moves that describe diagrams of isotopic singular link cobordisms in 4-space .",
    "even more so , upon fixing a height function on the 3-space of the projection and working with movie descriptions of these projections , one may ask :  what are the movie moves for isotopic singular links cobordisms ? \"",
    "the purpose of our paper is to answer this question .    in order to find a complete list of movie moves that are sufficient to construct any isotopy of singular link cobordisms",
    ", we develop first an analogy with the reidemeister - type moves for singular link diagrams .",
    "then , by examining the generic critical points and transverse intersections in 4-space as an isotopy between singular link cobordisms occurs , we obtain the roseman - type moves and their movie parametrizations for singular link cobordisms .",
    "in addition , by considering all possible changes in folds and in the relative position of the critical points of multiple - point strata and folds ( where these changes preserve the topology of the projection ) we arrive at a list of twenty - four movie moves for singular link cobordisms .",
    "our main result is the following movie - move theorem :    [ thm : movie - moves ] two movies represent isotopic singular link cobordisms if and only if they are related to each other by a finite sequence of moves for movies depicted in figures  [ fig : roseman ] , [ fig : carter - saito ] , and [ fig : new - reidclips ] or interchanges of the levels of distant critical points .",
    "since singular link cobordisms include classical knot / link cobordisms , the set of movie moves given here will include the carter - saito movie moves .",
    "the idea of the proof of our movie - move theorem is similar to that in  @xcite .",
    "although some familiarity with  @xcite would be useful , we have strived to have a self - contained paper and detailed exposition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : sing - links ] we discuss the critical points and transverse intersections in 3-space as an isotopy of singular links occurs .",
    "then we use this analysis to provide a proof of the classical result involving reidemeister - type moves for singular link diagrams .",
    "the heart of the paper is section  [ sec : cobordisms ] , where we introduce singular link cobordisms and describe their generic diagrams in 3-space , analyze the singular strata of such diagrams , and finally prove theorem  [ thm : movie - moves ] .",
    "we finish with a few remarks and comments in section  [ sec : remarks ] .",
    "a _ singular link _ is an immersion of a disjoint union of circles in @xmath0 , which has finitely many singularities that are all transverse double points .",
    "a singular link can be regarded as an embedding in @xmath0 of a 4-valent graph whose vertices have been replaced by rigid disks .",

    "the second definition is more convenient for our purposes .",
