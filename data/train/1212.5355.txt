    "the recent seven - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observation @xcite and south pole telescope sunyaev - zeldovich ( spt - sz ) survey @xcite support the @xmath1cdm model with an inflaton .",
    "the spacetime of the universe is the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry with a cosmological constant and the matter field is a single large - field inflaton with a power not greater than two",
    ". it would thus be interesting to study the frw universe with a scalar field beyond the inflationary era .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of not only matter fields but also spacetimes become important far beyond the inflation period toward the big bang singularity .    hawking and penrose have shown that under the weak energy condition all timelike ( null ) geodesics end at a singularity and the universe must have the big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "in many inflationary models the weak energy condition is violated but under the averaged hubble expansion the universe has also a beginning @xcite .",
    "general relativity necessarily ends up with with the big bang singularity , the classical theory breaks down and geometries and matters suffer quantum fluctuations .",
    "therefore understanding the universe including the big bang era necessarily requires quantum gravity .",
    "the quantum geometrodynamics based on the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation is a canonical approach , in which three - geometries of spacelike hypersurfaces and their extrinsic curvatures are conjugate pairs @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the geometrodynamic approach is that the variables present in the einstein equation for cosmological models are quantized and that semiclassical gravity emerges from oscillatory wave packets along classical spacetime trajectories but still keeping quantum fluctuations of matters .",
    "another quantum gravity is the path integral over all geometries and matters , which is substantiated by hartle - hawking s no - boundary wave function that sums all compact euclidean geometries which match with the lorentzian geometry on a three - hypersurface @xcite .",
    "the hartle - hawking wave function seems to be qualitatively favored by the current cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "however , it would be interesting to revisit quantitatively quantum frw cosmology with minimal scalar fields with monomial and general potentials @xcite .",
    "one advantage of quantum cosmology based on the wdw equation is that semiclassical gravity emerges from wdw equation along wave packets and recovers unitary quantum field theory in the curved spacetime .",
    "thus it provides a natural and consistent framework to study the back - reaction problem @xcite .",
    "for instance , quantum frw cosmology with massless fields together with a cosmological constant explains the back - reaction of de sitter radiation @xcite , which is equivalent to the back - reaction of hawking radiation in a de sitter schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "this paper is the first of series of works on the third quantized formulation of quantum frw cosmology with a minimal scalar field @xmath2 \\psi ( \\alpha , \\phi ) = 0 \\label{frw scalar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 being the scale factor and @xmath4 denoting the terms from the three - geometry curvature and the cosmological constant of the frw geometry .",
    "quantum cosmology with a minimal massive scalar field was studied by hawking @xcite and with a minimal massive field in perturbed frw geometry by halliwell and hawking @xcite .",
    "quantum frw cosmology ( [ frw scalar ] ) with minimal scalar fields with monomial and general potentials was intensively studied by kim @xcite and kim and page @xcite .",
    "a remarkable prediction of the quantum frw cosmology with a minimal scalar field is that the wave functions ( [ frw scalar ] ) may not be singular even at the big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "the set of wave functions of the wdw equation is infinite corresponding to infinitely many cauchy initial data @xcite .",
    "each wave function of the wdw equation ( [ frw scalar ] ) describes a universe with fixed physical parameters such as the cosmological constant , the topology of the geometry and quanta for scalar fields .",
    "the proper context to interpret the wave functions may associate them with the operators that create or annihilate the wave functions .",
    "the quantization of the wdw equation is called the third quantization or quantum field theory since the wdw equation involves the second quantized matters . in the third quantization",
    "the wdw equation is a wave operator residing on the superspace and the wave functions are associated with the corresponding creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "thus the hilbert space consists of the vacuum of no - universe , one - universe state and multi - universe states .    in the third quantization for quantum cosmology , hosoya and",
    "morikawa @xcite studied a spatially flat frw cosmology minimally coupled to a massless scalar field and abe @xcite and horiguchi @xcite also studied an open universe with a cosmological constant with or without a massless field . in this paper",
    "we shall study quantum cosmology for an open or closed frw universe with @xmath0-massless scalar fields .",
    "the wave function of the wdw equation could be found in terms of the bessel and the hankel functions for the open universe and in terms of the bessel and the modified bessel functions for the closed universe .",
    "the compact spaces with constant curvature in the multidimenional quantum cosmological model play the same role of the massless fields in the wdw equation @xcite .",
    "a spatially flat universe will not be considered since the wdw equation is the same a free klein - gordon equation . each wave function for given momenta of the massless fields carries the evolution of the universe in the third quantized formulation .",
    "the three - curvature of the frw geometry provides an intrinsic time - dependent term .",
    "this hamiltonian for the wdw equation is equivalent to an infinite number of decoupled time - dependent oscillators , whose quantum states could be found in terms of the invariant operators that play the role of the time - dependent annihilation and creation operators .",
    "these operators for each universe with the given momenta and with the given topology construct interesting wave functions , such as the gaussian wave functions , the number - state wave functions and the coherent states .",

    "the fact that time does not appear in the super - hamiltonian and the super - momenta constraints in the adm formalism raises the question of the origin of time in canonical quantum gravity , i.e , the wdw equation .",
    "it should be reminded that the superspace for a globally hyperbolic spacetime , such as the frw geometry , has a lorentzian signature and one of the variables may play an intrinsic time in the superspace . then the wdw equation is the @xmath18-dimensional wave equation in the superspace with a time - dependent mass .",
