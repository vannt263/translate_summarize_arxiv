    "eclipsing binary systems offer unique conditions to measure fundamental parameters of stars , such as stellar masses , radii and luminosities , which are of great importance in studies of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the main purposes of this work are : a ) the derivation of the geometric and photometric parameters of each system through light curve ( hereafter lc ) analysis , b ) the approximate calculation of the absolute parameters of their components and c ) a description of their current evolutionary status .",
    "in addition , frequency analysis search was performed for possible pulsational behaviour in the candidate systems for including a @xmath0  sct component .",
    "concluding , in the present study we selected the following three , previously neglected , systems which are lacking accurate photometric measurements and/or modern lc analysis in order to derive for the first time their main physical characteristics .",
    "* v405  cep : * this system ( @xmath1=8.95  mag , @xmath2=1.37374@xmath3 ) was discovered as a variable by @xmath4 mission @xcite and has an algol - type lc . the only available information for this binary concerns its a2 spectral type ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while @xcite included it in their list of candidate systems for including pulsating components .",
    "* v948  her : * the system s algol - type variability was discovered by @xmath4 mission @xcite .",
    "it has a period of 1.27521@xmath3 , a @xmath1-magnitude of 9.26 and its spectral type is listed as f2 in many catalogues ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the system is also candidate for containing a @xmath0  sct component @xcite .",
    "* kr  mon : * this binary was discovered as a variable by @xcite .",
    "its period is 1.15097@xmath3 and its brightness has a magnitude of 11.7 in @xmath1-filter .",
    "the _ gcvs _ catalogue @xcite and the _ mk catalogue of stellar spectral classifications _",
    "@xcite list it as a g3v type star .",
    "lcs of the system in @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters were obtained by the @xmath7 project @xcite , but no analysis has been made so far .    *",
    "uz  sge : * the binary nature of this algol - type system ( @xmath1=11.4  mag , @xmath2=2.21574@xmath3 ) was reported by @xcite .",
    "its spectral type is given either as a3v @xcite or a0v @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite calculated the absolute parameters of its components but they resulted in different values .",
    "there are many minimum timings available in the literature since the discovery of the system . @xcite and @xcite analysed its orbital period changes and concluded that , a third body with minimal mass of @xmath80.7  m@xmath9 may exist in a wide orbit .",
    "@xcite obtained and analysed @xmath5 and @xmath10 lcs of the system and resulted in two possible geometrical configurations with different mass ratios .",
    "the observations were carried out at the gerostathopoulion observatory of the university of athens from november 2008 to july of 2010 . a 40  cm cassegrain telescope equipped with various ccd cameras and the @xmath11 photometric filter set ( bessell specification )",
    "were used for data collection . in particular , all systems were observed with the st-10xme ccd , except kr  mon for which the st-8xmei ccd was used .",
    "standard data reduction processes ( i.e. dark and bias removal , flat - field correction ) and aperture photometry were applied to the data and differential magnitudes using the software _ muniwin _ @xcite were obtained .",
    "the details of observations are given in table [ tab1 ] , where it is listed : the _ nights spent _ and the _ time span _ of the observations , the comparison @xmath12 and check @xmath13 stars used with their respective magnitudes in specific bands , and the mean photometric error of the variable - comparison magnitude values ( i.e. standard deviation @xmath14 ) for each filter used .",
    "the lcs of each system were analysed simultaneously using the _ phoebe _ v.0.29d software @xcite that follows the method of the 2003 version of the wilson - devinney ( wd ) code @xcite .",
    "all photometric points were given the same statistical weight ( i.e. 1 ) and all of them were taken into account in the lc analysis .",
    "due to the absence of spectroscopic mass ratios , the ` @xmath15-search ' method using a step of 0.1 was trialled in modes  2 ( detached system ) , 4 ( semi - detached system with the primary component filling its roche lobe ) and 5 ( semi - detached system with the secondary component filling its roche lobe ) to find ` photometric ' estimates for the mass ratio @xmath16 . briefly",
    ", the @xmath15-search method can be described as follows : the @xmath15 value was kept fixed , while the other fitting parameters ( see below for details ) were adjusted .",
    "therefore , the programme , for a given @xmath15 value , produced a sum of squared residuals @xmath17 .",
    "this procedure was repeated for a range of @xmath15 values and for different modes .",
    "the @xmath15 value corresponding to the minimum @xmath17 ( from all modes ) was adopted as the most possible one .",
    "then , this value was set as initial input and treated as free parameter in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the temperature values of the primaries were assigned values according to their spectral types by using the correlation given in the tables of @xcite and were kept fixed , while the temperatures of the secondaries @xmath18 were adjusted .",
    "the bolometric albedos , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and gravity darkening coefficients , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , were set to the generally adopted values @xcite for the given spectral types of the components .",
    "the linear limb darkening coefficients , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , were taken from the tables of @xcite ; the dimensionless potentials @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the fractional luminosity of the primary component @xmath27 and the inclination @xmath28 of the system s orbit were set in the programme as adjustable parameters .",
    "1 shows the @xmath15-search plot for each system for the finally adopted mode .",
    "best - fit models , observed lcs and 3d plots are presented in figs  2 - 3 with corresponding parameters given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the parameters formal errors , given in parentheses , were directly calculated from the programme .",

    "complete lcs of the eclipsing systems v405  cep , v948  her , kr  mon and uz  sge were obtained and analysed using well known modern techniques .",
    "the results were used to calculate the absolute parameters of their components and make an estimate of their present evolutionary status .",
    "v405  cep is a detached system with its primary component almost in the middle of zams - tams limits , while its secondary was found to be closer to zams .",
    "according to the mass values of these stars , it seems that the more massive component is more evolved that the less massive one .",
    "this situation is in agreement with the stellar evolutionary models .",
    "however , we notice that the stars show large radius difference , so , it is expected that the primary will fill its roche lobe first as it evolves faster and , therefore , it will become a mass looser .",
    "for v948  her it was found that its components are more evolved , reaching the tams , but they are well inside their roche lobes .",
    "it is noticed that , although its components have a large difference in their masses , they are almost in the same evolutionary status .",
    "this fact comes in disagreement with our knowledge for stellar evolution , assuming a simultaneous birth of the components .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained with the scenario of past mass transfer from the present secondary to the primary , or less likely with a rapid mass loss ( e.g. due to very strong stellar winds ) of the secondary",
    ".    on the other hand , the picture of kr  mon is different .",
    "its components have almost equal temperatures , masses and sizes , but none of them has reached its critical roche volume so far . both of them are slightly evolved and lie outside the tams limit .",
    "however , they are very close in filling their lobes , therefore they will probably come into contact in the future .",
    "of course , the latter needs further justification with future observations , e.g. a period study showing if they are approaching each other .",
    "uz  sge was found to be a classical algol with the less massive and cooler component filling its roche lobe .",
    "its primary is close to zams and was revealed as a @xmath0  sct type pulsator , whose pulsating phase must have started relatively recently , if we consider both its dominant frequency value ( i.e. fast pulsator ) and its present evolutionary status @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to the definition given by @xcite it can also be considered as oea star ( i.e. a classical algol system including an oscillating ms component of a - f spectral type ) . the secondary component of the system is far beyond the ms edge and it must have been transferring a great part of its mass to the primary according to its present mass and evolutionary stage .",
    "therefore , in the past it was very probably the more massive star of the system , evolved faster , reached its critical roche limit and after that it started losing mass up to the present .",
    "however , according to the period analysis of the system @xcite no secular period change that can be connected with the mass transfer process @xcite was found .",
    "probably the system is at slow mass - accretion stage @xcite with a rate that can not be detected with the current time coverage of minima timings . @xcite and @xcite revealed also the possibility of a tertiary component s existence with a minimal mass of @xmath80.7  m@xmath9 and a mass function @xmath29  m@xmath9 . from the present lc analysis we found a third light contribution of @xmath307.5% to the total luminosity of the system . assuming the ms nature of the third component",
    ", its luminosity based on the mass - luminosity relation for dwarf stars ( @xmath31 ) can be derived .",
    "given the absolute luminosities of the binary s members ( see table [ tab3 ] ) , we can estimate the expected light contribution ( @xmath32 ) of the potential third star by using the following formulae : @xmath33    according to this hypothesis , we found that the third body s luminosity percentage is 1.4% , that means less than the observed one .",
    "this difference , although it is large , it is based both on the minimal mass of the third body ( coplanar orbit ) and on its ms nature .",
    "hence , if we use the mass function equation of the third body ( cf .",
    "* ) :    @xmath34 ^ 3 = \\frac{(m_3 \\sin i_3)^3}{(m_1+m_2 + m_3)^2}\\ ] ]    with the wide orbit s period @xmath35 in yr , and the lite amplitude @xmath36 in days , we can see that , with @xmath37 , we get @xmath38  m@xmath9 , a value satisfying the observed luminosity contribution . as an alternative , we can also assume that the third body is an evolved star providing more light than a ms star with the same mass . to sum up , we conclude that indeed there must be another component around the system , but its mass and nature remain open questions .    the mass ratio values for v405  cep and v948  her show deviation from the average of the ` well known ' detached binaries from the list of @xcite .",
    "however , that list contains only 74 cases of well studied detached binaries , therefore many deviations are expected to be found .",
    "similar systems with relatively small mass ratio values are e.g. al  gem and uu  leo @xcite , el  vel @xcite , gsc  4589 - 2999 @xcite and ar  lac @xcite . moreover , the lcs of v405  cep and v948",
    "her present total eclipses ( both ones for v405  cep and the secondary one for v948  her ) , hence , the mass ratios can be considered of well determined using the ` @xmath15-search ' method @xcite",
    ". however , the error values of @xmath15 for these systems are not that realistic , given that their ` @xmath15-search ' diagrams show a shallow minimum ( see fig .  1 ) ,",
    "therefore , they can be considered only as formal ones .",
    "the parameters of kr  mon and uz  sge are well inside the limits of detached and semi - detached systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "radial velocity measurements are certainly needed for deriving more accurate the absolute parameters of these close binaries and , therefore , obtaining a more realistic view of them .",
