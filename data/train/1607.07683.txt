    "splitting methods for evolution equations have been studied extensively in the past years .",
    "the use of such methods for time integration allows one to split the problem into subsystems which can be integrated more efficiently or sometimes even exactly @xcite",
    ". moreover , splitting methods perform well in the preservation of geometric properties , which is one of the main keys for numerical integration @xcite . for reaction - diffusion equations with a linear elliptic diffusion operator ,",

    "the diffusion is assumed to be a linear elliptic differential operator , whereas the reaction is nonlinear but smooth .",
    "because of the constraint , we deal with so - called _ partial differential - algebraic equations _ ( pdaes ) which generalize the concept of differential - algebraic equations @xcite to the infinite dimensional case . since these systems are known to be very sensitive ( e.g.  with respect to perturbations ) , we propose to apply splitting methods that reduce the given system to a linear pdae and a nonlinear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) . with this",
    ", we only need to solve a nonlinear system in every spatial discretization point instead of a high - dimensional nonlinear pdae .",
    "it has been observed in various situations that splitting methods suffer from an order reduction if , e.g. , non - trivial boundary conditions are prescribed @xcite . since",
    "boundary conditions can be seen as a constraint on the dynamics , similar effects are expected for general constraints .",

    "as mentioned before , we take a splitting approach in order to eliminate the nonlinearity from the pdae .",

    "we introduce a correction term @xmath14 which is zero for the classical lie and strang splitting but aims to maintain the expected convergence orders of those methods . with a suitable correction",
