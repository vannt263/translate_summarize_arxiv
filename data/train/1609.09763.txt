    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) result when the cool , low mass secondary in a binary contacts its roche lobe and transfers material to the white dwarf primary .",
    "to arrive at this stage , the standard evolutionary paradigm involves having the more massive component in the binary evolve off the main sequence and engulf its companion in a short - lived common envelope ( ce ) phase ( e.g. , iben & livio 1993 ) . during the ce phase , the outer atmosphere of the primary star",
    "is removed by interaction with the secondary star , and this interaction leads to either a stellar merger , or a more compact binary ( politano & weiler 2007 ) .",
    "angular momentum loss , such as through `` magnetic braking '' ( verbunt & zwaan 1981 ) , eventually leads to a semi - contact binary and a cv is born . in most of the early population synthesis calculations ( cf .",
    ", howell et al . 2001 , and references therein ) the vast majority of donor stars in cvs were expected to be unevolved .",
    "if true , the donor stars should generally appear to be similar to their main sequence counterparts , except for the effects introduced by the mass loss process .",
    "thus , while they will have a slightly different mass - radius relationship due to the secondary being out of thermal equilibrium , their photospheres should not show any abundance peculiarities .    the standard evolutionary paradigm though is slowly changing to reflect the fact that many long period cvs appear to have donors with unusual masses and/or radii .",
    "this suggests that the secondaries in some subset of cvs have undergone significant evolution prior to becoming interacting binaries .",
    "podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) constructed a population synthesis for cvs that allowed for evolved secondaries with initial masses of up to 1.4 m@xmath7 .",
    "inclusion of these objects allowed them to explain the wide dispersion in the observed temperatures of donor stars in cvs with p@xmath8 @xmath4 5 hr .",
    "this result confirmed the conclusions of baraffe & kolb ( 2000 ) , that long period cvs are dominated by systems containing evolved secondaries .",
    "recently , goliasch & nelson ( 2015 ) have produced a new population synthesis calculation that includes detailed nuclear evolution .",
    "they confirm the results of podsiadlowski et al . , showing that there is a large range of masses and radii for donors in cvs with p@xmath8 @xmath4 5 hr when nuclear evolved secondary stars are considered .",
    "two other interesting results from this study are that cvs with evolved secondaries do not have a period gap p@xmath8 @xmath9 3 hr ( see kolb et al .",
    "1998 ) . ] , and they can evolve to much shorter periods than predicted by models where evolved donors are not considered .",
    "podsiadlowski et al .",
    "suggest that the secondaries that have undergone pre - cv evolution should show evidence for nuclear processing , in particular , products produced via the cno cycle .",
    "two alternative paths that might allow the donor stars in cvs to acquire peculiar abundance patterns are for them to accrete such material during the original common envelope phase , or during the briefer common envelope phase that results from a classical nova eruption .",
    "marks & sarna ( 1998 ) have investigated a large number of scenarios for the composition of the surface layers of cv donor stars that have accreted both types of material , and find that significant changes are possible .",
    "a common theme amongst these models are large deficits of carbon . in a series of papers we have presented near - ir @xmath2-band spectra that demonstrated that the secondaries of many cvs appeared to have significant carbon deficits ( harrison et al .",
    "2004a , 2005ab , 2009 ) .",
    "recently , harrison & hamilton ( 2015 , `` h&h '' ) used synthetic spectra to quantify that ss cyg , ru peg , and gk per had carbon abundances that were 10 to 30% of the solar value .",
    "in contrast , however , they found that the metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) of the donor stars were solar , or only slightly subsolar .",
    "the study by h&h was limited to the @xmath2-band and , as they describe , there are not many strong atomic absorption lines in that bandpass to derive more precise values of [ fe / h ] , nor enough spectral lines from any species other than carbon to allow derivation of their abundances . to remedy this issue ,",
    "we have developed the capability to generate synthetic spectra that cover the @xmath10 bandpasses .",
    "this allows us to investigate the abundances of other important elements for the subset of cvs we have observed using cross - dispersed spectrographs . from modeling these data",
    "we find a wide range of values for [ fe / h ] , and for [ c / fe ] .",
    "in addition , however , we find a number of cvs that appear to have unusual abundances of aluminum , magnesium , and/or sodium . due to the lack of an extensive line list ( and other uncertainties discussed below )",
    "our abundance analysis has been limited to cvs whose secondaries have spectral types earlier than m0 .",
    "recently , relationships have been developed to extract metallicities for m dwarfs . using those relationships it is possible to examine the cooler secondary stars found in short period cvs for abundance anomalies .",
    "we describe the observations in the next section , the generation of synthetic spectra in section 3 , the results on cvs with k - dwarf secondaries in section 4 , the process and data needed to generate metallicities for m dwarfs in section 5 , discuss our results in section 6 , and present our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "the majority of the new data presented below was obtained with spex on the irtf .",
    "spex was used in cross - dispersed mode generating spectra spanning the wavelength range from 0.8 to 2.45 @xmath0 m . in the @xmath2-band ,",
    "the dispersion is 5.4  / pix .",
    "nearby a0 v stars were used for telluric correction , and these data were telluric - corrected and flux- and wavelength - calibrated using the spextool package ( cushing et al .",
    "spextool attempts to fit , and remove the h i lines in the telluric a star . while this process can work quite well , many times there remain residuals at the positions of the strongest h i lines .",
    "thus , the line strengths and profiles of strong h i absorption or emission features in these data should not be taken too seriously .",
    "a log of all of our observations for previously unpublished data is presented in table [ obslog ] , and it lists the ut date , start and stop times , the length of the exposure times used for each object , the instrument used , the orbital period , the orbital phase at the mid - point of the observational sequence ( except for u gem where full orbits were covered ) , and the outburst state for each of the cvs .",
    "we also present previously unpublished spectra obtained with nirspec on keck .",
    "we used nirspec in low - resolution , single order mode with a 0.38 \" slit .",
    "the grating tilt was set so as to cover the wavelength region 2.04 @xmath0 m @xmath9 @xmath11 @xmath9 2.46 @xmath0 m , with a dispersion of 4.27  / pixel .",
    "we employed the two - nod script , and used 4 minute exposure times for all of the program cvs . to correct for telluric absorption , we observed bright a0v stars located close to the program objects so as to minimize their relative differences in air mass .",
    "these data were reduced using the idl routine redspec , specially developed for nirspec .    finally , we used triplespec ( wilson et al .",
    "2004 ) on the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m telescope to obtain phase - resolved near - ir spectra of u gem over two orbital periods , and for 50% orbital period coverage of qz ser .",
    "triplespec is similar to spex in that it provides cross - dispersed spectra covering the near - ir , from 0.95 @xmath0 m to 2.46 @xmath0 m , at a resolution of r @xmath12 3500 .",
    "the 1.1 \" slit was used , and all exposures were four minutes in length .",
    "these data were reduced using `` triplespectool , '' a version of spextool modified by michael cushing for use at apo .",
    "nearby a0v stars were used to provide telluric correction .    in the following we will also be analyzing the spectra of cvs",
    "observed in just the @xmath2-band with the irtf using spex , at keck with nirspec , or at the vlt with isaac .",
    "all of these data have been previously published in harrison et al .",
    "( 2004a , 2005ab , 2007a , 2009 ) , and hamilton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . unless otherwise noted , all of the spectra have been doppler corrected using published radial velocity data and orbital ephemerides",
    "in h&h we described the construction of a python - based program ( named `` @xmath13 '' ) that used moog ( sneden 1973 ) to generate a large grid of synthetic @xmath2-band spectra , and to autonomously search through this grid to derive the best fitting result for each program object .",
    "as described there , the focus of that effort was in modeling the co features , and the capability to investigate the abundances of other elements was not implemented . with the desire to expand our coverage to shorter wavelengths , we decided to abandon further development of @xmath13 in favor of using `` spectrum '' by r. gray .",
    "the main driver for this decision was the existence of a line list covering the visual and near - ir .",
    "as discussed in h&h , the process of constructing and validating a @xmath2-band line list was quite onerous , and one we wished to avoid if possible .",
    "as in h&h , we fixed the micro - turbulence to 2 km s@xmath14 for all synthetic spectra , a value that appears to best represent normal stars ( husser et al . 2013 , smith et al .",
    "likewise , all of our synthetic spectra were run with log@xmath15 = 4.5 .",
    "cesetti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have examined the use of moderate resolution data from the irtf spectral library to derive diagnostics for cool stars .",
    "they found very few features that allow for accurate quantification of log@xmath15 for higher gravity stars . given the large rotation velocities of cv donors , the limited spectral resolution , and the presence of numerous emission features , it is not possible to constrain the surface gravity from the data discussed herein .",
    "unlike @xmath13 , spectrum is not natively designed to use a multiple processor machine that greatly aids in speeding - up the process of generating large grids of models . to allow us to quickly construct large grids of synthetic spectra using spectrum",
    ", we used the gnu shell tool `` _ parallel _ '' with our 32 core linux workstation .",
    "we found that we could generate models as quickly with spectrum @xmath16 @xmath17 , as with @xmath13 .",
    "the other main difference between the use of spectrum vs. @xmath13 is that the latter uses marcs atmosphere models when computing synthetic spectra , while spectrum was designed for the input of kurucz models .",
    "thus , before we began our program we first had to insure that the results generated with spectrum matched those generated by @xmath13 ( see h&h for validation of @xmath13 ) .",
    "we ran a small grid of models with identical parameters using both @xmath13 and spectrum .",
    "in addition , we also translated the marcs models used for this test into the format used by kurucz to determine if the input atmosphere model resulted in significant differences .",
    "the spectra produced by the three processes were identical as far as we could tell .",
    "as in h&h , the next step was to validate the line list using template k dwarf spectra . for this process",
    "we used the same set of dwarfs as in h&h ( the data are from the irtf spectral library , cushing et al",
    "we found that in general , the `` luke.nir '' ( covering 6800   @xmath9 @xmath11 @xmath9 1 @xmath0 m ) and `` luke.ir '' ( covering 1 @xmath0 m @xmath9 @xmath11 @xmath9 4 @xmath0 m ) line lists were quite reliable .",
    "we did adjust the oscillator strengths for some of the strongest mg i lines , but otherwise few changes were necessary .    in fig .",
    "1 we present the spectra in the @xmath10 bandpasses for the k dwarf templates with the best fitting models calculated using spectrum .",
    "we identify the strongest atomic and molecular absorption features in each panel to show the redundancy of spectral features for each of the elements , and as a guide for when we discuss features in the spectra of the program cvs .",
    "except for the cn bandhead near 1.1 @xmath0 m , the models reproduce all of the strongest spectral features .",
    "the spectral regions near 1.1 @xmath0 m and 2.0 @xmath0 m are afflicted with strong telluric features that compromise the observations .    as we did for the @xmath2-band in h&h , to determine the best fitting models we constructed heat maps from a @xmath18 analysis .",
    "those for the @xmath19-band , covering the spectral types from k0v to k5v , are shown in fig .",
    "we tabulate the best fitting value for t@xmath3 and [ fe / h ] for each of the template stars from a @xmath18 analysis of the synthetic spectral grid for each of the bandpasses in table 2 . in this table",
    "we also list the averages from those fits , and their nominal values ( see table 2 in h&h ) . in h&h ,",
    "the typical error bars in the determination of [ fe / h ] and t@xmath3 from the spex data using just the @xmath2-band were @xmath20 0.25 and @xmath20 250 k , respectively .",
    "as shown in table 2 , the errors in both quantities , when averaging over the four bandpasses , are all smaller , and easily within the combined error bars of our models and the averages of the published values .",
    "we must note that the temperature grid of the kurucz atmospheres steps in intervals 250 k , while the abundance grid at each temperature was [ fe / h ] = @xmath160.5 , @xmath160.25 , 0.0 , @xmath210.1 , @xmath210.2 , @xmath210.3 , @xmath210.5 , and @xmath211.00 ( we also interpolated between the @xmath210.5 and @xmath211.00 models to create atmospheres with [ fe / h ] = @xmath210.75 ) .",
    "thus , there is an uneven quantization in the model values of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the average of the differences in temperature between our models and the nominal values is only @xmath1622 k , suggesting our temperature derivations using these low resolution spectra are reliable : @xmath22 = @xmath20 110 k. for the values of [ fe / h ] , however , the average of the differences is @xmath210.11 , suggesting that we tend to derive slightly lower metallicities than the means of the published values .",
    "thus , while the formal error on our derivation of [ fe / h ] for the templates is only @xmath22 = @xmath20 0.04 , the offset we find , and the actual error bars on the nominal values , suggests that the true standard deviation on our metallicities is at least a factor of two larger than this .    in the following subsection",
    "will use this same technique for all of the cvs with k - type secondaries .",
    "@xmath18 minimization will be used to derive t@xmath3 , [ fe / h ] , and [ c / fe ] .",
    "note that the @xmath18 minimization process was only run on select regions of the spectra in each of the photometric bands . as described in h&h",
    ", we avoid regions with strong emission features intrinsic to the cv , and regions where strong telluric features compromise the calibration . in the @xmath2-band ,",
    "the analysis was first conducted on the spectral region from 2.19 @xmath0 m to 2.29 @xmath0 m to arrive at values for t@xmath3 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "then the region from 2.19 to 2.36 @xmath0 m was used to find the best fitting value of [ c / fe ] . if we were to include the co region into the initial @xmath18 analysis for the @xmath2-band , the results are greatly biased by the strength of the co features ( which might have a non - solar abundance ) . in the @xmath19-band the analysis region",
    "was constrained to 1.16 @xmath9 @xmath11 @xmath9 1.26 @xmath0 m .    in the @xmath23- and @xmath24-bands ,",
    "the available spectral regions for analysis are compromised by h i and/or ca ii emission lines .",
    "there were no cvs for which a @xmath18 analysis was possible in the @xmath23-band .",
    "while there are gaps between the paschen series in the @xmath23-band , no strong absorption features are visible in those gaps . for most of the cvs , the @xmath18 minimization calculation for the @xmath24-band was run over the wavelength interval 1.55 @xmath9 @xmath11 @xmath9 1.67 @xmath0 m .",
    "there were cvs , however , where the brackett series made this impossible ( e.g. , gk per ) . in all cases , we visually inspected the reasonableness of the fit of the final model to the data in the @xmath23- and @xmath24-bands that was derived from the @xmath19- and @xmath2-band analysis .    for several of the cvs",
    "it is clear that the abundances of magnesium , sodium , and/or aluminum appeared anomalous . in those cases we ran models with the best - fit values for t@xmath3 and [ fe / h ] , but with small changes in the abundances of the element that seemed peculiar .",
    "we then derived the value for the deficit / enhancement of that element from visual inspection .",
    "the final results for all of the objects are listed in table [ results ] . in this table , and in the remainder of the paper , cv subclasses , orbital periods and inclinations are from the online version of the ritter & kolb ( 2003 ) catalog ( `` rkcat '' ) , unless otherwise noted . in table [ results ] we list the object name , the cv subtype , p@xmath8 , t@xmath3 of the donor derived from the modeling , its metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , its carbon abundance ( [ c / fe ] ) , listing any other abundance anomalies in the final column . in several cases , we set the abundance to a prescribed value before modeling , when this occurs , the value in the table is followed by an `` = '' sign .      using the methods described above , we now present the results from modeling the program objects .",
    "we want to stress again that the presence of h i emission throughout the range of these spectra severely limits the @xmath18 analysis .",
    "thus , the precision of the derived metallicities for the cvs are almost certainly poorer than those derived from the k - type templates .",
    "the following subsections on the individual cvs are ordered by orbital period . as shown in knigge et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , cvs with orbital periods above 5 hrs are expected to have masses of m@xmath25 @xmath12 0.6 m@xmath7 for their donor stars .",
    "the spectral type of a main sequence star with such a mass is m0v .",
    "thus , we will start with the assumption that all cvs with p@xmath8 @xmath4 5 hr will probably have k type donors ( though our analysis may lead to a different answer ) .",
    "gk per is a long period ( p@xmath8 = 48.1 hr ) cv that had a classical nova eruption in 1901 ( see harrison et al .",

    "we are better able to constrain the metallicity and carbon abundance , leading to slightly revised results ( but within the error bars of both results ) .",
    "in addition to a strong deficit of carbon , we also find that all of the mg i lines ( see fig . 1 for identifications )",

    "the issue with this spectral classification , however , is that the ca i triplet is much weaker in ei psc than the na i doublet ( see fig .",
    "[ eipsc ] ) . for k dwarfs ,",
    "these two features have a similar strength , and it is not until the mid - m dwarfs ( @xmath12 m5v ) where the ratio of the equivalent widths for the na i and ca i features becomes as large as seen here ( 2.2 ) . like qz ser , there is no evidence for co absorption features in this spectrum . unlike qz ser , there is h i emission . if we assume the secondary has a temperature of 4500 k , the best fit model to the spectrum , has [ fe / h ] = @xmath210.2 , and [ c / fe ] = @xmath211.7 . like qz ser , na i appears to be enhanced , and we find [ na / fe ] = @xmath160.9 provides a good match to the two doublets in the @xmath2-band .    while we did not need to invoke an h deficit to explain the nirspec data , it is likely that the short orbital period of this system requires it to be hydrogen deficient .",
    "thorstensen et al .",
    "show that if the donor had an initial mass of 1.2 m@xmath7 , and mass transfer began shortly after the end of h burning , the secondary star could evolve to short periods while maintaining a high temperature .",
    "this model predicts a depletion of c , and enhanced levels of n in the photosphere . using our results for qz ser as a guide , if the donor in ei psc has an h deficiency of 30% like the thorstensen et al .",
    "model , the na i enhancement would be much smaller , and the abundances of the other metals would have to be substantially subsolar .",
    "we have used near - ir spectra to derive metallicities and effective temperatures for forty one cataclysmic variables spanning most of the major subclasses .",
    "we have extended the program described in h&h to enable us to generate synthetic @xmath10 spectra , allowing us to model cross - dispersed spectroscopy of cvs we have obtained with spex on the irtf , or triplespec at apo .",
    "we then constructed grids of models to compare to both cross - dispersed and @xmath2-band spectra for analysis of those cvs with k type secondary stars .",
    "we have used the recent metallicity calibrations that employ @xmath2-band spectra to derive temperatures and values of [ fe / h ] for cvs with m - type donor stars .",
    "these calibrations were applied to template spectra enabling the direct comparison of similar objects , bolstering the determinations of t@xmath3 , [ fe / h ] , and allowing for estimates of [ c / fe ] . as found in h&h , and implied in the data from harrison et al .",
    "( 2004a , 2005a , b , 2009 ) , carbon deficits were found for numerous ( 21/36 ) objects .",
    "the trend , however , is that these deficits were more likely to occur in long period cvs ( p@xmath8 @xmath4 4 hr ) , then in short period systems .",
    "we discuss this , and the other main results in the subsections that follow .",
    "h&h investigated whether it was possible for co emission to create apparent carbon deficits .",
    "they found that the presence of co emission , presumably from the accretion disk , overlaying the absorption features of the secondary star creates a spectrum with unique co absorption feature profiles : blue emission wings , and dramatically narrower bandheads . using those model results , it is very simple to identify co emission even in noisy data .",
    "we found four cvs with such emission : uu aql , ls peg , cn ori , and cz ori . with the inclusion of wz sge",
    ", this brings the number of cvs that exhibit co emission to five . _ none _ of the other cvs discussed above show evidence for co emission .",
    "thus , any derived carbon deficits are real , though the quality of the spectra often limited our ability to derive precise values of [ c / fe ] .",
    "the ability to compare templates with known metallicities to cvs with m - type secondaries makes the identification of carbon deficits in the shorter period cvs more robust than previous efforts that lacked this information .",
    "one relevant question is why do these five cvs show co emission ?",
    "as described in h&h , co emission is believed to originate in the outer , cooler parts of the accretion disk .",
    "we believe that there are three possible explanations .",
    "the first is that co emission is a transient phenomenon .",
    "the second is that the mass transfer rate in these five systems is just right to create the environment amenable to co emission . or third",
    ", the structure of their accretion disks is somehow altered by composition , leading to conditions that fosters co emission .",
    "only a larger spectroscopic survey of cvs can answer the first possibility , though the co emission in wz sge was present for at least a full year ( see harrison 2016 ) .",
    "the low s / n , low resolution @xmath2-band spectrum of wz sge presented by dhillon et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , is highly suggestive of co emission being present in wz sge as far back as 1997 .",
    "this would rule it out as an artifact of the 2001 eruption .",
    "given its long inter - outburst intervals and low accretion rate , one would expect the disk structure in wz sge to be relatively stable .",
    "thus its co emission might be persistent .",
    "we have no second epoch observations for the other sources with co emission .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observations of cn ori and uu aql were obtained just a few days after they had returned to minimum light following outbursts .",
    "we have a handful of other objects that have observed more than once . in h&h ,",
    "gk per , ss cyg , and ru peg were observed twice in one week with no change in the co features .",
    "ru peg and ss cyg were also previously observed by harrison et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , and dhillon et al .",
    "( 2002 ) observed ss cyg .",
    "there is no evidence for co emission in those data .",
    "we have three epochs of observation for ss aur , including harrison et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , and it has never shown the signature of co emission .",
    "it will take additional epochs of observation to ascertain whether co emission is transitory .",
    "if we assume co emission is tied to accretion rate , the second explanation does not seem especially viable , as ls peg clearly has a very large accretion rate , while wz sge has one of the lowest .",
    "the third explanation might be a possibility , given that the donors in cz ori , uu aql and cn ori all have large subsolar values of [ fe / h ] .",
    "wehrse & shaviv ( 1995 ) explore the role that metal opacities have on the structure of accretion disks .",
    "the group of objects with the most extreme values for their carbon deficits ( [ c / fe ] @xmath9 @xmath211.0 ) are a heterogeneous set : ae aqr , ch uma , v1309 ori , u gem , qz ser , vy aqr , and ei psc .",

    "it is tempting to suggest that like qz ser , the objects with the most extreme carbon deficits are hydrogen deficient .",
    "in contrast to harrison et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , we now have evidence that polars are not always `` normal , '' as both v1309 ori and am her have carbon deficits .",
    "knigge et al .",
    "( 2011 ) published a compilation of the distribution of cv donor spectral types vs. p@xmath8 .",
    "they show that a reasonable fit to the distribution results from both standard evolutionary models , as well as models with different angular momentum loss prescriptions .",

    "the origin of the spectral types plotted in their figure come from a diverse set of methodologies ( see knigge 2006 for references ) .",
    "given that the majority of the donor stars in the current survey have subsolar metallicities , most of the spectral types in that compilation are , at best , suspect .",
    "some of them have been shown to be wrong ( such as the l0 spectral type for vy aqr ) .",
    "our version of this diagram ( less gk per ) is presented as fig .",

    "while there is a general trend of shorter period cvs to have cooler donor stars , the spread at any p@xmath8 or t@xmath3 can be significant .",

    "fortunately , metallicity plays no significant role . for late - type dwarfs , mann et al . also found that there is a fairly tight correlation between radius and temperature .",
    "thus , for hydrogen burning main sequence stars , there is an easily defined relationship between mean density and temperature .",
    "given that the mean density of a roche - lobe filling star is closely tied to orbital period ( @xmath87 = 107p@xmath88 gm @xmath89 , equation 2.3b in warner 1995 ) , and the mean density of the roche lobe filling star is @xmath87 = 3m/4@xmath90r@xmath91 , there are only a small number of variables involved that can act to create a range in observed temperature at any particular orbital period .",
    "the equivalent spherical radius of the roche - lobe filling donor star , r@xmath52 , is a function of the mass ratio , and dependent on the size of the semi - major axis of the orbit . for p@xmath8 = 4.3 hr and m@xmath51 = 1 m@xmath7 , r@xmath25 = 0.5 and 0.4 r@xmath7 , at @xmath92 = 0.5 and 0.25 , respectively .",
    "for main sequence stars , these two donor stars would differ by @xmath12 350 k. thus , a large difference in the mass ratio can have a significant influence on the observed temperature of the donor star at a fixed orbital period .",
    "returning to the objects with periods near 4.3 hr , the mean density of the donor at this period is 6.1 gm @xmath89 . as shown in fig .",

    "the observed spectral type is two subtypes later than expected .",
    "ss aur , with an orbital period very similar to u gem , assuming all things being equal , should have approximately the same type donor star .",

    "secondary stars with these spectral types would have temperatures between @xmath12 3600 k and 3900 k , _ in good agreement with the predictions from the relationship for main sequence stars_. kt per , which has an orbital period of 3.9 hr , was found to have an inferred secondary star spectral type that agrees with the main sequence mass - radius relationship at its orbital period ( though it has a very low metallicity ) .",
    "the donor in am her was found to have a spectral type of m5 , while the parallax suggests the luminosity of an m3.5v .",
    "the inclination of am her is @xmath36 = 50@xmath38 .",
    "if inclination is the source of the later - than - expected spectral types in cvs , than we are postulating that the gravity darkening of the secondary stars is responsible for this result . the gravity darkening can be expressed as t@xmath3 @xmath93 @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the gravity darkening exponent . for radiative stars",

    "we conclude that for the shorter period systems , inclination appears to be the main source of the `` cooler than expected '' spectral types .",
    "any remaining scatter can then be attributed to chemical peculiarities in the individual objects , or the various systems could have dramatically different binary mass ratios . with analogies to qz ser , the odd abundance patterns in u gem and tw vir suggest hydrogen deficiencies , and thus one would not expect them to exactly mimic the properties of normal main sequence stars .    the other main peculiarity in the p@xmath8 @xmath21 t@xmath3 diagram is the existence of a set of six cvs ( ae aqr , ch uma , v1309 ori , v426 oph , ss cyg , and ah her ) , with t@xmath3 = 4750 k , but with a large spread in orbital period . in every case , we find that these objects have significant carbon deficiencies .",

    "ss cyg and ah her have subsolar metallicities .",
    "the most reasonable explanation for this result is that the donor star underwent nuclear evolution prior to the system formally becoming a cv , and these objects have unusual radii and/or masses .",
    "ru peg is an example of a donor in a long period cv that is more than a magnitude more luminous than it would be if it had the radius of a main sequence star .    as first shown in podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and re - addressed by goliasch & nelson ( 2015 ) , the inclusion of evolved donors in cv population studies leads to a considerable spread in t@xmath3 at orbital periods @xmath4 5 hr .",
    "this effect arises due to some donors being zero age main sequence stars at the time they become semi - contact binaries , while others have undergone significant nuclear processing .",
    "our results , combined with the growing numbers of donors in long period cvs that have unusual physical properties ( e.g. , connon smith et al .",

    "2007 , neustroev & zharikov 2008 , rodrguez - gil et al . 2009 ) , confirm the conclusions of baraffe & kolb ( 2000 ) that cvs with evolved secondaries dominate the population .",
    "many cv donor stars must have had initial masses that were larger than 1 m@xmath7 , and our measurements of magnesium deficiencies for several long period cvs strengthens this argument .      in the preceding",
    "we have mostly ignored the possibility of contamination influencing the determination of donor star spectral types . here",
    "we wish to briefly explore how a hot source , such as the white dwarf , or hot spot on the accretion disk , might alter the spectral type derivation .",
    "qualitatively , the addition of a hot blackbody source to the spectrum of a late - type star should result in the derivation of an earlier spectral type than reality .",
    "this argument can be mostly blunted by noting that the depth of various atomic and molecular absorption features are dependent on the temperature of the underlying donor star .",
    "thus , the match of the continua _ and _ absorption features of two objects with similar metallicities confirms they have similar spectral types .    here",
    ", however , we have the possibility of non - solar metallicities as well as non - standard abundance patterns , and thus can not blindly assume that a match of the continuum and absorption features in two objects signals concordance of temperature . to test this ,",
    "we simply have added blackbodies with various fractions of the @xmath2-band flux to the spectrum of a m - type template star ( note that for the analysis of cvs with k - type secondaries , we have continuum divided them , removing any subtle contamination effects ) .",
    "if the contamination is at a low level , @xmath12 25% , we find that a donor with a true spectral type of m5v could be confused with an m3v .",
    "larger levels of contamination , however , will not result in further confusion , as the depression of the continuum due to water vapor at both ends of the @xmath2-band spectrum of an m5v remains imprinted on the continuum of the contaminated spectrum .",
    "thus , the spectrum of a highly contaminated m5v can not be confused with templates that have spectral a type of m2v or earlier .",
    "it is possible for those objects with very low values of [ fe / h ] to have weak water vapor features .",
    "their continua would be easier to reproduce with larger contamination fractions .",
    "the weakening / dilution of the spectral features that comes with a larger contamination would imply an even lower metallicity .",
    "this suggests that several of the shortest period systems with the lowest metallicities in table 3 , such ex hya and v893 sco , are affected by this process .",
    "but we have already identified that these two objects suffer significant contamination .",
    "thus , the process of deriving t@xmath3 from nir spectra is surprisingly robust .    the other argument that we are not finding earlier spectral types than reality comes from analysis of those objects with astrometric distances . in nearly every case",
    ", the luminosity of the cv system in the @xmath2-band implies an earlier spectral type for the donor than found here .",
    "there is no doubt that the @xmath2-band spectra of u gem and ss aur suffer little contamination : harrison et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that the contamination of the @xmath2-band luminosities of both objects was less than 5% .",
    "yet we find that in both cases , the observed spectral type is too late to explain their observed @xmath2-band luminosities . in ss aur",
    ", we need an m2v to explain the @xmath2-band luminosity , while we derive a donor spectral type of m3v .",
    "an m2v is a full magnitude more luminous than an m3v , and the contaminating source would have to supply more than 70% of the observed flux . in u gem the situation is even worse , with the contaminating source having to supply over 90% of the observed luminosity . while contamination is present at some level in every cv , it certainly is not seriously affecting our results .",

    "the presence of mg deficits in several long period cvs argues that the donor stars in these systems had large initial masses .    a caveat for the determination of [ fe / h ] exists for cvs with m - type donors , as variations in the c / o ratio could lead to the derivation of artificially low values for [ fe / h ] ( veyette et al .",
    "this concern is especially relevant given that many cvs have carbon deficits .",

    "due to the extreme carbon deficits seen in some donors , cvs could provide the data to better establish and/or calibrate the effect of the c / o ratio on the metallicity estimates for normal field stars .",
    "this could be easily accomplished with new multi - bandpass nir spectroscopy of those cvs in table 3 with proven carbon deficits .",
    "it is also now abundantly clear that while the donor stars in cvs may superficially resemble their main sequence cousins , many of them have undergone significant nuclear evolution prior to becoming a cv .",
    "the inclusion of such objects into recent population studies is a welcome change , and demonstrates that stellar evolution processes alone are able to explain many of our results .",

    "new models for the outbursts of dwarf novae that employ non - solar abundance patterns and/or hydrogen deficiencies should also be considered , so as to investigate whether composition has any affect on outburst properties .",
    "the same is true for models of classical novae eruptions , as the composition of the accreted material appears to alter the nature of these events ( shen & bildsten 2009 ) .",
    "we close by noting that the total mass of the u gem system is larger than the chandrasekhar limit , and if the mass lost to cne eruptions is not too great , the system could become a type ia supernova . note that if the donor star in u gem is even modestly hydrogen deficient , one of the main arguments against single - degenerate cvs as snia progenitors is removed : the lack of h i emission lines in their post - deflagration spectra .",
    "pakmor et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have found that models for the amount of matter stripped from a main sequence donor star in an snia explosion is roughly consistent with the limits implied by observations .",
    "hydrogen deficits in cv donors would only aid this result .",
