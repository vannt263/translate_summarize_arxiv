    "theoretical investigations into compact star matter have seen a boom over the past decade , spurred forward by the plethora of observational data collected for the masses and radii of pulsars . the mass - radius",
    "( m - r ) data has been particularly useful for constraining the dense matter equation of state ( eos ) at zero temperature . for a recent review",
    "see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "these constraints provide an experimental sandbox for probing the properties of matter that is inaccessible in terrestrial experiments .",
    "the question investigated in this work is whether or not quark matter is manifest in the interior of compact stars by a phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter and , if quark matter is indeed manifest , what would the implications be on the observables , as well as the qcd phase diagram .",
    "we solve this question by implementing an effective , relativistic density - functional approach to both the hadronic and the quark matter equation of state ( eos ) at zero temperature . a method for implementing quark confinement in a chiral quark matter model",
    "is based on reviving the idea of the string - flip model ( sfm ) @xcite .",
    "according to the sfm , the confining interactions between colored constituents ( modeled , e.g. , through a cornell - type confining potential ) get saturated within nearest neighbors . in hadronic matter",
    "these quark neighbors are the ones bound in a hadron while at high densities , in a multiquark system one has to draw string connections between quarks so as to neutralize the color while keeping the total length of all strings at a minimum",
    ". this task can be solved by simulation @xcite or by effective quantum statistical methods @xcite .",
    "one can obtain the string length distribution function for a given density and fold a given interaction potential model with this distribution in order to obtain the correlation energy in a meanfield approximation .",
    "since the average string length between quarks in uniform matter is related to the scalar number density @xmath2 by being proportional to @xmath3 , one obtains a corresponding contribution to the energy density functional of quark matter , see also @xcite . adopting the confining interaction as a scalar potential , and @xmath4 being the scalar density of quarks , this density functional this density",
    "functional describes the medium modification of the quark mass , being a dirac scalar . at low densities",
    "the quark mass diverges thus mimicking confinement by removing quarks as dynamical degrees of freedom . at low density",
    "the quarks are clustered into hadrons and this quark cluster phase is energetically preferable over the uniform quark matter with diverging scalar confining interaction .",
    "increasing the density , quark exchange effects between hadrons ( pauli blocking ) lead to strong repulsion ( that can be described by an excluded hadron volume model ) and to delocalization of the quark wave function , driving the system into the homogeneous quark matter phase . in the phase transition region , the reduction of the available volume ( in which the nonperturbative dual superconductor vacuum of qcd persists which expells the color field lines by the dual meissner effect ) leads to a reduction of the density of color field lines and thus to a `` screening '' of the string tension by the available volume fraction factor . at still higher densities higher order quark interactions adopted according to @xcite lead to a stiffening of quark matter that allows for a stable branch of hybrid stars with quark matter core .",
    "we have developed the eos for hybrid star configurations by implementing a mean - field modification to the free fermi gas . in the resulting quasi - particle gas , it is necessary to maintain thermodynamic consistency by introducing rearrangement terms to the scalar and vector channel energy shifts , the modifications to the quasi - particle s characteristics , i.e. the effective mass and effective chemical potential .",
    "thermodynamic consistency is the requirement that the thermodynamic relations , derived from the thermodynamic potential ( @xmath5 ) modified by the scalar and vector channel shifts and corresponding rearrangements , must maintain all well - known thermodynamic quantities .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "we begin by outlining our relativistic density - functional approach in sect .",
    "[ rdf ] . in sect .",
    "[ results ] , we discuss our solutions to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation with parameterizations of our hybrid eos and how observations constrain our choices of parameterization . a discussion and concluding remarks will be given in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] and sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] , respectively .",
    "the appearance of a stable branch of compact stars with quark matter core at high masses which is disconnected from the stable neutron star branch and is called the `` third family '' of stable hybrid stars , is a main result of the new relativistic density functional based eos introduced in this work .",
    "the effective relativistic density - functional ( rdf ) approach has been successfully applied in describing warm , dense asymmetric nuclear matter with light clusters @xcite as well as other systems where the fundamental interaction between constituents is not a priori known .",
    "thus , this rdf approach is adopted and applied here to the hybrid quark - hadron matter eos .",
    "the final hybrid eos is comprised of two separate rdf eos for each phase of matter , combined by utilizing a maxwell phase transition construction .",
    "the correct thermodynamic treatment of quark matter depends on the physical constraints of the system which are to be probed . for large volumes of quark matter that exist for long times , i.e. the thermodynamic limit , the conserved quantities are quark number ( or baryon number ) , electron charge , color charge , and lepton number .",
    "each of these conserved quantities has an associated chemical potential .",
    "these large systems must remain charge- and color - neutral , which determines the values for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this leaves a three- dimensional phase - space parameterized by the baryon chemical potential ( @xmath8 ) , the lepton chemical potential ( @xmath9 ) , and the temperature ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "compact stars are large systems of degenerate matter , which tend to exist for quite long times , so the thermodynamic limit constraints are valid for describing these systems .",
    "neutrinos are considered capable of escaping from cold compact stars due to their negligible interaction which entails a sufficiently large mean free path , so lepton number is not conserved .",
    "this leaves compact star matter to be constrained by baryon number and @xmath10 . for our further discussion",
    ", we shall be operating in the zero - temperature regime , further reducing the parameters to just the baryon number . for quark matter in compact star systems , due to the large threshold chemical potential for strange quarks @xmath11 mev ( and larger for the heavier flavors of quarks ) , contributions from heavy quarks",
    "are negligible @xcite and therefore not considered in this approach . utilizing",
    "the above mentioned assumptions , both the hadronic and quark matter phase in compact stars obey the following conditions .",
    "the matter is in @xmath0-equilibrium with electrons , @xmath12    the relevant chemical potentials @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 satisfy the weak - equilibrium condition , @xmath16    where we have assumed that the neutrinos escape without interacting .",
    "the quark and baryon densities are related by @xmath17    the charge density of the system ( without muons ) is written as @xmath18    the charge - neutrality condition in compact stars requires that @xmath19 .",
    "when considering the possibility of a phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter , the phenomenon of high - mass twins presents itself .",
    "the term high - mass twins refers to the existence of two compact star configurations that have the same mass but distinctly different radii in a mass range that covers the presently best known high mass of the pulsar psr j0348 + 0432 with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the existence of the high - mass twins hinges on the nature of the phase transition in these dense systems . in order for the appearance of this phenomenon",
    ", the eos of the compact star matter must have a strong first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "the first - order transition must exhibit a large jump in energy density of the two phases ; this is also known as a large latent heat . in order to support this phenomenon",
    ", a necessary condition is @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the latent heat , and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the energy density ( pressure ) at the onset of the deconfinement phase transition . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the existence of high - mass twins would imply the existence of at least one critical endpoint in the qcd phase diagram @xcite . the existence of high mass twins can potentially be observationally confirmed .",
    "if the radii of two compact stars with sufficiently accurately measured high mass like , e.g. , psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite and psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite could be measured ( for instance by the nicer mission ) and turn out significantly different from each otherr , then this would present evidence for high - mass twins that imply a strong first - order transition in compact star matter .    in order to obtain high - mass twins ,",
    "it is necessary to fulfill the following constraints :    * a strong stiffening of nuclear matter at supersaturation densities , * a sufficiently soft behavior of quark matter at the hadron - to - quark matter phase transition , in order to have a sufficiently large latent heat @xmath25 @xcite , and * a sufficient stiffening of quark matter above the deconfinement transition .",
    "these properties characterize the class of hybrid eos we are investigating in the present work .      for the hadronic phase we use the well known dd2 model by typel et al .",
    "@xcite with the parametrization given in @xcite .",
    "it is a relativistic density functional model , based on meson exchange interactions .",
    "it describes the properties of nuclear matter at saturation density and below very well , also in accordance with the chiral eft approach @xcite , see also @xcite . to improve the higher density behavior ,",
    "a generalized excluded volume effect is included according to ref .",
    "@xcite using the gaussian form of the ( isospin independent ) available volume fraction @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the excluded volume parameter that will be varied in our current work to investigate its effect on the neutron star mass - radius curves .",
    "the available volume fraction is coupled to the degeneracy factor creating @xmath29 .",
    "this effectively reduces the degrees of freedom as the system becomes more dense .      in the rdf approach to interacting quark",
    "matter the lagrangian is given by @xmath30 where the interaction potential @xmath31 is in general a nonlinear functional of the scalar and vector quark currents .",
    "the interaction potential is decomposed as linearly dependent functions of the currents . to achieve the linearization of the interaction in order to arrive at a quaiparticle representation , the scalar and vector current interactions are taylor expanded around the corresponding expectation values @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",

    "the general form of the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be modeled after specific interactions . in the next section ,",
    "the specific interaction potentials that will later be inserted into this general rdf quark matter model are introduced .",
    "when the rdf quasi - particle fermi gas was derived , the interaction potential in the lagrangian was introduced as quark - self - energies in the scalar and vector channels , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the self - energies were expanded about the condensate values , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , utilizing the taylor expansion to the first - order .",
    "quark confinement is achieved through a density dependence of the quark masses , @xmath59 , generated by the scalar quark interaction energy @xmath60 that diverges for densities approaching zero ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mass_vs_nb ] ) .",
    "this divergence of the quark interaction energies is entirely compensated by that of the confining interaction in the equation of motion for hadrons @xcite .",
    "as usual for fermions , there is also a vector interaction - energy , @xmath61 , that results in an energy correction .    the approach for quark matter is to take the effective scalar and vector exchange to be proportional to a power of the scalar and vector number densities , respectively .",
    "the two meanfield shifts are introduced heuristically .",
    "the scalar dependent meanfield modification is absorbed into the mass , and the vector dependent meanfield modification is absorbed into the chemical potential , as outlined in subsect .",
    "[ ss : iqg ] .",

    "the sfm modification takes into account the occupation of the surrounding medium by color fields within the @xmath66 term , which is the string - tension term modified by the available volume .",
    "the effective in - medium string tension results in our model from multiplying the vacuum string tension @xmath67 between quarks with the available volume fraction ( [ eq : hadron_avol ] ) @xmath68 since the reduction of the string tension is understood as a consequence of a modification of the pressure on the color field lines by the dual meissner effect since the reduction of the available volume corresponds to a reduction of the nonperturbative dual superconductor qcd vacuum that determines the strength of the confining potential between the quarks .",
    "we illustrate this situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : meissner ] .          in the same manner that the scalar shift was introduced , an effective shift to the energy is introduced and absorbed into the chemical potential as @xmath69    the vector mean - field contribution to the effective chemical potential , @xmath70 , embodies all of the vector - medium effects for interacting quark matter .",
    "the vector self - energy is adopted from previous investigations of higher order quark interaction terms , ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this modification assumes multiquark interactions that become more relevant at increasing densities .",
    "the multiquark interaction is decomposed into two separate terms , a 4-quark @xmath71 and an 8-quark @xmath72 term @xmath73    the 4-quark term dominates in the densities near the onset of the quark matter phase transition , while the 8-quark interaction contributes more strongly at densities much larger than the onset of quark matter . in order to maintain causality in the star configurations ,",
    "the 8-quark interaction needs to be suppressed at larger densities or else the speed of sound @xmath74 defined by @xmath75 will not exceed the speed of light ( @xmath76 ) and thus obey the causality constraint .",

    "the effective reduction of the string tension in dense matter by the available volume @xmath128 results in an appropriate softening of the eos in the region of the hadronic to quark phase - transition .",
    "this approach satisfies observational constraints for pulsars taking into consideration a transition to quark matter , while at the same time successfully fulfilling the requirements to obtain a stable third branch of hybrid stars and high - mass twins solutions .",
    "the present approach can be straightforwardly extended to finite temperatures so that quark - hadron hybrid equations of state for applications in simulations of supernova explosions and neutron star mergers can be provided .",
