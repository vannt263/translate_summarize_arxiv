    "although such polarized broad lines have been seen before in s2s , what is remarkable is that these hidden broad lines are among the broadest ever observed , with fwhm @xmath2 13,000 - 17,000 km s@xmath10and fwzi @xmath2  25,000 - 32,000 km s@xmath10 .",

    "although broad h@xmath0  is very prominent in the polarized flux spectra of both galaxies , broad h@xmath16  is weak or absent , a feature also noted by @xcite .",

    "we measure a broad - line balmer decrement h@xmath0/h@xmath16  of @xmath2 10 for ngc 2110 and 3.9 for ngc 5252 . although the broad - line balmer decrement in agns has generally been thought to be difficult or unsuitable to use as a reddening indicator due to the extreme conditions of the blrs that make it susceptible to collisional excitation and other radiative transfer effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite found that statistically , the mean intrinsic broad - line h@xmath0/h@xmath16  in a large sample of seyfert 1s and qsos is actually about 3 , only slightly steeper than case b value , with very little dispersion .",
    "furthermore , they found that this ratio is rather insensitive to different agn properties , with a mean empirical value for a sub - sample of double - peaked emitters ( dpes ) to be 3.27 . assuming that this is the intrinsic balmer decrement for this type of objects , we infer a reddening of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for the broad - line regions ( blrs ) of ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 , respectively .",

    "also listed for comparison are the mean observed polarizations in the wings of the broad h@xmath0  emission line .",
    "we selected a region that displayed the highest peak observed polarization for each object .",
    "for ngc 2110 , it was the blue wing of h@xmath0  in the observed wavelength range 6457 - 6501 , and for ngc 5252 , it was the red wing in the observed wavelength range 6761 - 6812  .",
    "figure [ contpol ] shows the observed continuum polarizations in the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane for ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 from table [ olog ] , along with the polarizations of the ispol probes from table [ isp ] . as table",
    "[ isp ] and figure [ contpol ] show , the ispol observed from the probes for ngc 5252 are relatively small and fairly consistent with each other , and we adopt the average result of the top two highest polarized probes ( @xmath23 = 0.18% , @xmath24 = 74 ) as the ispol toward ngc 5252 . for ngc 2110 ,",
    "the results from the ispol probes are more difficult to interpret since the observed polarizations from the four selected stars are more `` scattered '' or discrepant from each other , and their magnitudes are comparable to those observed for the continuum of ngc 2110 . therefore , more care needs to be applied when selecting the most appropriate ispol .",
    "we can apply two criteria to help us make this selection .",
    "one is that the `` best '' ispol would preserve the perpendicular relationship between the polarization p.a . and the well - determined radio and ionization cone axes of ngc 2110 .",
    "the second is that an appropriate ispol correction should maintain a similar polarization p.a . between the continuum and broad h@xmath0  line @xcite .",
    "the ispol correction that satisfies both of these tests is one from the probe ppm 188568 ( star # 4 , @xmath23 = 0.11% , @xmath24 = 165 ) , and we adopt this as the most representative galactic ispol toward ngc 2110 .",
    "this is also the most conservative estimate of the ispol , as it has the smallest magnitude of the four stars and does not significantly rotate the observed @xmath24 . for comparison , @xcite used @xmath23 = 0.33% , @xmath24 = 34.5  as the ispol .",
    "the correction of ispol was made by fitting a serkowski curve ( serkowski , mathewson , & ford 1975 ) to the adopted ispol and subtracting it from the observed @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that neither of the galactic ispol adopted here for ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 made a significant modification to the observed polarizations .",
    "their corrections are minor , and the conclusions reached in this study are not sensitive to the adopted ispol",
    ".      figure [ contpol ] also displays the polarizations in the broad h@xmath0  wing . as can be seen ,",
    "the observed polarizations are much higher there than in the continuum .",
    "this is the result of lessened dilution by the underlying host galaxy in the h@xmath0  emission because of the higher flux in the line compared to the continuum .",
    "significant variations in polarizations in both the continuum and broad h@xmath0  lines are observed , with somewhat higher magnitude in the line .",
    "for example , for ngc 2110 in epochs 2@xmath154 , when the continuum polarization remained relatively unchanged , the h@xmath0  wing polarization went from 1.9% to 2.9% , a change by a factor of @xmath21.5 .",
    "similarly , in ngc 5252 the broad h@xmath0  wing @xmath23 varied by a factor of 2 over all epochs , while the continuum @xmath23 remained within a factor of @xmath2 1.3 of each other .",
    "close examination of figure [ contpol ] also shows that the observed polarization p.a .",
    "@xmath24 seems to significantly vary over the observed epochs .",
    "in addition , there appears to be a slight rotation of @xmath2 6  between the continuum and broad h@xmath0  @xmath24 ; i.e. , the polarization changes are not along a radial vector on the @xmath21-@xmath22 plot , as in ngc 2110",
    ". the direction and small magnitude of the inferred galactic ispol can not account for this rotation , implying that there is another polarized component at play .",
    "this third polarized component ( besides the scattered agn continuum and broad h@xmath0  line ) could be the substantial ( see below ) host galaxy starlight which has traditionally been assumed to be unpolarized , but may be slightly polarized in these cases , perhaps due to dichroic absorption within the agn host itself .",
    "one piece of evidence in favor of this interpretation is that the @xmath24 variation observed in the continuum ( @xmath2 7 - 17 ) is greater than that in h@xmath0  ( @xmath2  few degrees ) , due to the greater relative contribution of starlight in the continuum than in the emission line . consistent with this , @xmath27 during `` high '' continuum state appears to agree well with @xmath28 in `` low '' broad h@xmath0  state .",
    "compare , for example , @xmath28(epoch 3 ) with @xmath27(epoch 4 ) of ngc 2110 , and @xmath28(epoch 2 ) with @xmath27(epoch 5 ) of ngc 5252 .",
    "if the third polarized component comes from the ispol in the host galaxy itself , it would induce a polarization in the narrow lines .",
    "indeed , narrow emission lines are clearly seen in the polarized flux spectra .",
    "we measure the narrow - line polarization from the [ o  iii ]  @xmath29@xmath294959 , 5007 emission lines and plot them as solid triangles in figure [ contpol ] .",
    "the narrow - line polarization is @xmath30 = 1.1% , @xmath31 = 89  for ngc 5252 , and @xmath30 = 0.98% , @xmath31 = 46  for ngc 2110 .",
    "it is easy to see from the figure that a correction for the narrow - line polarization in ngc 5252 would result in a radial change in polarization p.a . on the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane for both the continuum and broad line at a p.a . of @xmath2 68 , thus strengthening the host ispol origin . on the other hand ,",
    "correcting for the narrow - line polarization in ngc 2110 does not preserve such a relationship , and we believe its narrow - line polarization probably arises from scattering in the narrow - line region ( nlr ) itself .",
    "to within only a few degrees , the polarization p.a.s after correction for ispol are closely perpendicular to the radio and ionization cone axes in both galaxies . for ngc 5252",
    ", polarization @xmath24 is @xmath2 70 , compared to a p.a .",
    "of @xmath2 345  for the radio and emission - line cone axis @xcite .",
    "for ngc 2110 , the polarization @xmath24 @xmath2 70 , orthogonal to the radio and emission - line structure p.a . of @xmath32 150 - 170  @xcite . in both cases , the polarization p.a .",
    "is essentially the same between the continuum and the broad h@xmath0  emission line to within the uncertainty .",
    "the observed variation in the broad polarized h@xmath0  emission can be attributed directly to variations in the emitting line flux , as the intrinsic broad - line polarization does not appear to change over time .",
    "the _ intrinsic _ broad h@xmath0  polarizations derived by dividing the continuum - subtracted broad - line flux in the polarized flux spectrum over its counterpart in the total flux spectrum yield @xmath33(h@xmath0 ) @xmath34% for ngc 5252 and @xmath33(h@xmath0 ) @xmath35% for ngc 2110 over the epochs observed .",
    "the uncertainty of the measurement is @xmath365% .",
    "the observed variation in the continuum and broad - line polarizations is consistent with a changing continuum and broad - line fluxes over a non - changing underlying stellar continuum of the host galaxy , as the polarization p.a .",
    "remains approximately constant in all epochs .",
    "an independent estimate of the galaxy fraction using the elliptical galaxies ngc 821 and ngc 6702 ( see tran 1995a ) as templates indicates that the galaxy fraction @xmath37 is @xmath2 0.85 and 0.830.95 for ngc 5252 and ngc 2110 , respectively .",
    "this implies that the intrinsic , galaxy - dilution corrected continuum polarization ( assuming an unpolarized galaxy component ) is @xmath2 10% for ngc 5252 and @xmath2 5% for ngc 2110 .",
    "this agrees with the intrinsic broad h@xmath0  polarization of @xmath2 10% in ngc 5252 derived above , but falls well short of the estimated 20% for ngc 2110 , suggesting that another significant source of unpolarized light may be present @xcite . for both objects ,",
    "the galaxy corrected @xmath38 is relatively flat , suggesting that the diluting source of light is nearly independent with wavelength .",
    "we note in passing that , along with the liner - like emission - line ratios displayed by ngc 2110 @xcite and ngc 5252 @xcite , a strong starlight - dominated optical continuum is also an important secondary characteristic of the double - peaked emission - line agns @xcite .",
    "the exceptional discovery of this study is that the polarized broad lines from the nuclei of ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 have been observed to vary with time , which is quite unique and unprecedented about these objects .",
    "figure [ n2110 ha ] shows the continuum - subtracted profiles of h@xmath0  in polarized flux for ngc 2110 . in epoch 1 , note the clear blue peak in the polarized h@xmath0  emission line , and the correspondingly high polarization in the blue wing ( see figure [ n2110 ] , table [ olog ] ) .",
    "this profile most closely resembles ( as it was closest in time ) that observed in 2005 december by @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , this line profile is very similar to that of the prototypical dpe arp102b . by 2006",
    "december and 2007 february ( epochs 2 and 3 ) , this blue peak has disappeared , and the polarization there is also much smaller . by 2007 november ( epoch 4 )",
    ", the blue peak is starting to come back , with a correspondingly higher polarization there .",
    "similar variations are also observed in ngc 5252 , as shown in figure [ n5252 ha ] .",
    "here we show the continuum - subtracted polarized flux spectra around h@xmath0  for all five epochs .",
    "it can be seen that the polarized broad - line intensity was fairly prominent in 2004 june ( epoch 1 ) , became significantly weaker almost a year later in 2005 may ( epoch 2 ) , got stronger again in 2007 february and april ( epochs 3 and 4 ) , then became strongest in 2008 march ( epoch 5 ) . one notable difference compared to ngc 2110",
    "is that while the polarized broad h@xmath0  flux varied dramatically , this does not seem to be accompanied by a great change in the shape of the profile .",
    "the double - peak nature also appears less pronounced here compared to ngc 2110 .",
    "clearly , the polarized broad h@xmath0  is changing both in shape and intensity on timescales of months . over the smallest time interval between two adjacent epochs , which is about 2 months for both ngc 2110 and ngc 5252",
    ", changes are generally not seen , but definite changes are clearly observed on timescales @xmath1  1 yr . such dramatic variations on such short timescales in both the degree of polarization and profiles of the _ polarized _ broad emission lines have never been observed before in other classical hidden broad lines of s2s . in general ,",
    "variability is not expected in reflected , polarized light , since the scattering process tends to smear out any intrinsic variations . based on the elliptical disk fit to the broad h@xmath0  line of ngc 2110",
    ", @xcite found that the inner radius of the line - emitting disk is @xmath2 200 gravitational radii ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the black hole mass ) .",
    "this is rather small compared to many dpes ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that any changes taking place in this part of the disk could lead to rapid variations",
    ". continued regular monitoring of objects like ngc 2110 would provide better constraints on the timescales of the variability .",
    "the observed polarization variability can be summarized as follows . in the continuum ,",
    "the polarization remains little changed throughout the period being monitored , with @xmath23 being @xmath2 1.5% for ngc 5252 and @xmath2 0.5% for ngc 2110 .",
    "however , in the broad h@xmath0  emission line , both the observed polarization and polarized flux vary substantially with time .",
    "interestingly , there is _ no _ corresponding large changes in the polarization p.a .",
    "furthermore , the h@xmath0  polarization p.a .",
    "is the essentially same as in the continuum , suggesting that they have similar scattering geometry .",
    "finally , the polarization p.a .",
    "is closely perpendicular to the p.a . of the extended ionization cones and radio axes for both galaxies , confirming",
    "that scattering is the cause of polarization .",
    "the observed high degree of perpendicularity of the polarized p.a . to the radio and ionization cone axes in both ngc 5252 and ngc 2110 and",
    "the high intrinsic polarization ( @xmath41 ) of the broad h@xmath0  emission line clearly establish that scattering is the only viable mechanism producing the observed polarization .",
    "the most interesting finding of the present study is the discovery that the broad double - peaked h@xmath0  emission line from the nucleus of ngc 2110 displays dramatic changes in profile and intensity in polarized flux spectra on timescales @xmath1 1 yr .",
    "dramatic variation in the polarized flux intensity of h@xmath0  is also seen ngc 5252 , but detailed profile variation of its broad line is less pronounced than in ngc 2110",
    ". such behavior of the polarized broad lines from type 2 agns is entirely unexpected and has never been reported previously in other hblr s2s , as far as we are aware @xcite .",
    "temporal and structural polarization variability is common in type 1 agns , such as seyfert 1s and broad - line radio galaxies ( see e.g. , goodrich & miller 1994 ; martel 1998 ; cohen et al .",
    "1999 ; smith et al .",
    "2005 ) , but these variations are thought to be due to near - field scattering in an equatorial disk just outside the blr @xcite . such process can not account for the behavior that is observed in ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 since the blr and equatorial scattering region are both entirely obscured in these objects .",
    "nor can the rapid polarization flux variability be explained by the `` light - echo '' or `` search - light '' effect , in which differentially redirected light in a clumpy medium mimics the temporal variation of the polarization signal .",
    "such an effect may be able to reproduce changes in the degree of polarization and polarized flux level , but can not explain the observed changes in the structures of the emission - line profiles .",
    "this intrinsic variability of the polarized emission - line profile , coupled with the non - changing polarization p.a . of the emission line over time , suggests that the variations are due to changes in structures of the line - emitting region itself , _ not _ the scattering medium .",
    "profile variability of the broad h@xmath0  emission line has been known to be a very common property of the `` normal '' , directly viewed dpes @xcite . if emitted from an accretion disk , the relevant thermal and dynamical timescales , summarized in @xcite , range from days to hundreds of years depending on the mass of the accreting black hole .",
    "the black hole mass of ngc 5252 has been measured by @xcite to be @xmath42  @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite estimated the black hole mass within ngc 2110 to be @xmath44  @xmath43  using its observed stellar velocity dispersion and the @xmath40-@xmath45  relation .",
    "we can then estimate and compare these timescales for ngc 5252 and ngc 2110 .",
    "the observed polarized profile variations in ngc 5252 and ngc 2110 can not be due to thermal or sound - crossing phenomena because the timescales involved are too long  of order tens to hundreds of years .",
    "they are more consistent with the dynamical timescale for ngc 2110 ( @xmath2 12 months ) or light - crossing time in ngc 5252 ( @xmath2 2 months ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the polarized h@xmath0  variability in ngc 2110 is accompanied by significant profile variation , while that in ngc 5252 generally does not , suggesting that the observed polarized line flux variation in the latter might simply be due to response of the line emitting region to reverberation of a changing continuum flux .",
    "our observations can put several important constraints on the properties of the scattering medium .",
    "the polarization after correction for starlight dilution , and the observed polarized flux spectra are relatively flat and not significantly bluened as expected from rayleigh scattering by normal dust grains .",
    "this is consistent with electron scattering , although dust scattering by fine grains with the right properties or in a clumpy medium can also produce wavelength - independent polarized light @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume electron scattering as the main scattering mechanism for the rest of our discussion .",
    "as previous mentioned by @xcite and seen in our data , the shape of the scattered broad h@xmath0  is remarkably similar to other normal dpes , especially arp 102b , suggesting little modification or smearing of the line profile in the scattering process .",
    "although the exact amount of broadening is difficult to determine because the line is so broad , this places a constraint on the temperature of the scattering electrons to be @xmath3  @xmath1 @xmath4 k @xcite .",
    "discussion in the previous section also suggests that the scattered flux must be dominated by a few individual discrete clouds in a clumpy medium instead of a cone largely filled with material , as typically assumed in s2s ( i.e. , code & whitney 1995 ) .",
    "the observed variability timescales constrain the size of the scattering clouds to be very compact , @xmath1 1 lt - yr in size . because we must be able to observe the scattered light , and because the polarization p.a .",
    "is perfectly perpendicular to the radio and bicone axis , these scatterers must be distributed along the polar direction outside of the obscuring torus .",
    "the scattered fraction of light from a spherical cloud located at a distance @xmath46 from the nucleus with radius @xmath47 can be approximated as @xmath48 where we have assumed the probability of scattering to our line of sight is near unity , @xmath49  is the scattered luminosity , @xmath50  is the intrinsic or incident luminosity of the obscured nucleus , @xmath51 @xmath52 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath5  is the mean electron density , and @xmath53 is the fraction of solid angle subtended by the scattering cloud .",
    "if we assume that the scattering is optically thin to electrons , the optical depth @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is known from our observations to be @xmath2 1 lt - yr , it follows that the required electron density is @xmath5  @xmath56 @xmath7  and @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the scattered fraction in percent , @xmath59 is the electron density in units of @xmath60 @xmath7 , and @xmath61 is the radius of the scattering cloud in light years .",
    "the fraction @xmath62 can be estimated from the observed luminosity of the scattered broad h@xmath0  flux in ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 and comparing them to the directly viewed h@xmath0  luminosity of the normal dpes .",
    "the observed scattered broad h@xmath0  flux in ngc 2110 , and ngc 5252 are typically @xmath63 and @xmath64 ergs @xmath65 s@xmath10 @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "correcting these values for the @xmath2 20% and @xmath2 10% polarization of the broad line , respectively , this corresponds to a scattered broad h@xmath0  luminosity of @xmath66 ergs s@xmath10  for these two hidden dpes ( hdpes ) .",
    "the broad double - peaked h@xmath0  luminosity in a sample of directly viewed dpes is typically @xmath67 ergs s@xmath10  @xcite , about 2 orders of magnitude higher . assuming that ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 are the exact type-2 counterparts to these directly viewed dpes , this implies that the scattered faction @xmath68 , and equation ( 2 ) indicates that the scattering clouds need to be of order @xmath1 10 pc from the nucleus , placing them just outside the obscuring torus ( see e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , and between the blr and nlr",
    "this is also consistent with @xcite , who recently constrain the outer radius of the obscuring torus in ngc 2110 to @xmath69 pc .",
    "the electron density derived is also consistent with this location of the scatterers , lying just between typical values for the blr ( @xmath70 @xmath7 ) and nlr ( @xmath71 @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with density @xmath5  @xmath56 @xmath7  the required ionized",
    "gas mass for each light - year - wide scattering cloud is @xmath72 @xmath43 , assuming a filling factor of unity within the cloud , which may be an overestimate .",
    "the derived distance of @xmath1 10 pc for the scattering clouds is also consistent with our assumption of electrons as the dominant scatterers , as dust may have more difficulty surviving in the harsh environment in close proximity to the active nucleus .",
    "note that such a scattering region is much more compact and close - in to the nucleus than those previously envisioned for the classical hblr s2s , where the scattering region is thought to be the size of the extended nlr , or of order @xmath2 @xmath73 pc .",
    "scattering from such an extended scattering nlr may still take place in ngc 5252 and ngc 2110 , but our current observations dictate that reflection from these very compact , close - in scattering clouds must dominate the polarized light from these nuclei . in order for these scattering clouds to not `` smear '' out the variability , there must not be many of them along each ray , perhaps numbering @xmath1 10 .",
    "similar compact scattering region has been proposed by @xcite to explain the polarization behavior of the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 231 .",
    "based on ground - based and @xmath74 polarization observations , the lack of any spatially extended polarization structures and the presence of polarization p.a .",
    "structure across the broad emission lines place the dominant scatterers in mrk 231 to within 20 pc of the nucleus in a polar lobe distribution .",
    "this could be analogous to the compact scattering region indicated for ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 .",
    "we now speculate as to what this compact scattering region might be .",
    "we consider three possibilities : ( 1 ) line emitting gas `` ejectiles '' from the nucleus , ( 2 ) radio hot spots or material entrained in the base of the jets , or ( 3 ) material from the outskirts of the obscuring torus itself .",
    "it is noteworthy that all three possibilities discussed here have one common feature : they all involve agn feedback  winds or outflow of material driven by the central engine .",
    "the ejection or bipolar outflow model @xcite that was proposed to explain the double - peaked broad emission lines in normal dpes could provide the natural source of material near the nucleus to scatter the obscured nuclear continuum and broad lines .",
    "this scenario seems attractive as it could provide the source for both the blr and scattering gas clouds , and at the same time explain the double - peaked nature of these sources .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether the same gas clouds can serve for both purposes , as they must remain compact ( @xmath75 lt - yr ) after having been driven out to @xmath2 10 pc in the outflow .",
    "there may also be some difficulty for the scatterers to see both polar ejecta at this relatively close distance from the central source .",
    "the radio jet picture is also a plausible candidate since it provides a natural explanation for the preference of dpes in radio - loud agns , in which @xmath2 20% of dpes are found , compared to only @xmath2 3% in the general agn population @xcite .",
    "interaction of the radio jets with material immediately surrounding the central source could produce ionized gas or `` hot spots '' that could serve as the scattering medium . since these jets are thought to be highly collimated , it is probably not difficult to produce very compact scattering plasma clouds , as required .",
    "very large array ( vla ) imaging of ngc 2110 by @xcite indeed revealed a radio jet extending @xmath2 400 pc from a central core .",
    "very high resolution very long baseline array ( vlba ) imaging by @xcite capable of resolving subpc - scale details , subsequently showed some slightly resolved emission @xmath1 1 lt - yr in size extending @xmath2 1 lt - yr from the nuclear core in the same direction as the hundreds - pc scale jet .",
    "although the separation from the central engine may be too small , it is conceivable that these extended `` knots '' are associated with a compact scatterer .    finally , the hypothesized obscuring torus central to the agn unification model could provide readily available material for the scattering medium .",
    "perhaps the individual torus clouds in the clumpy torus model of @xcite and @xcite could themselves serve as the scattering mirrors . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", the obscuring clouds could be either dusty or dust - free , and because the appearance of a type 1 or type 2 agn is probabilistic , dependent partly on the number of clouds and not solely on the viewing angle , these clouds could play a role as both an obscuring source and the `` polar '' scattering region , as required .",
    "it is especially compelling to note that the physical properties of these clumpy torus clouds ( i.e. , @xmath5  @xmath56 , @xmath75 lt - yr , @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath43 , adjusted for @xmath78 pc and black hole masses of ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 ; * ? ? ? * ) are strikingly similar to those constrained for the scattering clumps in ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 .",
    "the discovery of two hdpes in seyfert 2s suggests that such objects may be common .",
    "other similar hidden extremely broad lines previously seen are probably those observed in cygnus a @xcite with polarized h@xmath0  fwhm of @xmath2 26,000 km s@xmath10 , and 2massi j130005.3 + 163214 @xcite with polarized h@xmath0  fwhm @xmath2 18,000 km s@xmath10 . on the other hand , that they can vary even in polarized flux means that many may also escape detection if not followed systematically by spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "the variability that these hdpes exhibit may also partly explain why about half of the seyfert 2s do not show any detectable hblrs in spectropolarimetric surveys , inconsistent with the simplest unification scheme ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the hblr seyfert 2s tend to lie in the `` hotter '' , `` stronger '' part of the [ o  iii ]  5007 luminosity versus ir color @xmath79  diagram ( his figure 9 ) , while the non - hblrs in the `` cooler '' , `` weaker '' area .",
    "figure [ trandia ] shows that both ngc 2110 and ngc 5252 lie in the non - hblr region of this diagram , suggesting that if it had not been for their variability , their hblrs might not have been detected .",
    "indeed previous spectropolarimetric observations of these sources at lick observatory did not reveal anything of interest @xcite ) in polarized flux , and @xcite reported only a marginal detection with significant uncertainty of polarized broad h@xmath0  in ngc 5252 . however , this could also be due to the inadequate depth of the observations with smaller telescopes .",
    "also , @xcite observations only extended to h@xmath16  and did not include h@xmath0 , and broad polarized h@xmath16  is difficult to detect even in the present observations .",
    "@xcite present a good assessment of the various models for the dpes in light of their comprehensive survey of radio - loud agns , and conclude that overall , emission from an accretion disk appears to be best at explaining all the various properties of the dpes .",
    "they disfavor , but do not rule out , other models , such as binary blrs , bipolar outflows , and anisotropically illuminated spherical blrs .",
    "while our observations do not clearly favor one model over others , it does suggest that bipolar outflows are still viable and less unlikely .",
    "if the scatterers are `` spent '' blr clouds ejected from the nucleus , then they may naturally serve as the same material responsible for the double - peaked emission lines .",
    "thus , the bipolar outflow model does provide a simpler picture for the two necessary ingredients of the hdpes : double - peaked broad - line emitting gas , and compact scattering material close to the nucleus .",
    "also , the well - defined bicone of ionized gas in ngc 5252 and ngc 2110 could serve as a natural extension of the bipolar outflow from the obscured nuclei .    if the scattering clouds are radio hot spots or material entrained in the jet ( see discussion in section [ scat ] ) then they necessarily must lie close to the radio axis , which presumably is the same as the axis of the accretion disk itself .",
    "this may present a difficulty for the accretion disk model .",
    "an elliptical accretion disk fit to the polarized double - peaked h@xmath0  line profile by @xcite indicates that the scatterers view the disk at an inclination angle of @xmath2 30",
    ". this best - fit angle may be less secure than those resulting from the modeling of other directly viewed dpes , because the exact contribution of light to this reflected broad - line profile is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , taken at face value , such viewing orientation seems uncomfortably far from the disk axis , since the radio half opening angles in seyfert galaxies are generally well within @xmath2 15  @xcite . for ngc 2110 in particular",
    ", the ionization cone is actually more `` jet - like '' @xcite , further suggesting that any scattering material from the jet should lie close to the pole .    if however , the scattering clouds come from the clumpy obscuring torus , then there is no restriction on the orientation of the scatterers relative to the radio axis as long as they lie within the ionization cones . in this case",
    ", the accretion disk model may be preferred , based on the very extended bicone morphology of the ionization structures in these galaxies , indicating that our viewing angle must be fairly large , most likely @xmath80 50  @xcite .",
    "the derived high intrinsic broad - line polarizations of @xmath2 10%-20% ( see section [ blpol ] ) indicate that the scattering angle is @xmath2 30 - 40 , based on the models by @xcite of an externally illuminated spherical electron - scattering blob .",
    "this suggests that our viewing angle is @xmath81 for the accretion model , more consistent with the observed extended ionization cone morphology than the inclination of @xmath82 inferred for the bipolar outflow / scattering radio jet model .",
    "from these observations we can draw the following conclusions .",
    "the fact that we detect any variations in polarized broad line at all indicates that the scatterers are physically very compact , with size scales of order 1 lt - yr , similar to the dynamical timescales of dpes .",
    "this suggests that the scattering is primarily done by a few discrete clouds rather than in a filled cone with a large filling factor , as previously assumed for s2s .",
    "second , because the continuum polarization and p.a .",
    "remain relatively little changed , with the p.a .",
    "being the same as in the broad emission line , these variations are most likely due to changes in the line emitting flux , perhaps because of changes in the structure of the line emitting region , and _ not _ the scattering medium .    with the reasonable assumption of electron scattering ,",
    "we constrain the size , location , temperature , and density of the ionized gas clouds responsible for the polarization .",
    "we find that the scattering clouds are @xmath1 1 lt - yr in size , confined to @xmath1 10 pc of the nucleus , having densities @xmath56 @xmath7  and temperatures @xmath83 k. this is probably similar to the compact scattering region proposed to exist in the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 231 by @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the scattering region could arise from gas `` ejectiles '' from the bipolar outflow , hot spots or material entrained in the base of the radio jets , or clumpy clouds from the outskirts of the obscuring torus itself .",
    "the derived physical properties of these scattering clouds are consistent with those of the clumpy torus clouds of @xcite and @xcite .    finally ,",
    "because they share many characteristics similar to the dpes , ngc 5252 and ngc 2110 are the type-2 or hidden counterparts of this class of objects , which has not been found until recently . continued spectropolarimetric monitoring of these objects would be very valuable in elucidating both the nature of the dpes and their connection to the general agn population as a whole .",
    "this research would not be possible without the foresight and generosity of the w. m. keck observatory directors , who have shared their observing time with the `` team keck '' scientific staff at the observatory .",
