    "graphite has many intriguing aspects from scientific and industrial view points .",
    "it has high electronic conductivity and large anisotropic diamagnetic susceptibility .",
    "the electronic structure is semi - metallic.@xcite an important point is that these characteristic features of an electronic structure originate from a particular lattice structure of graphite .",
    "the lattice structure is a stack of honeycomb networks of carbon atoms .",
    "a single layer of graphite is called graphene .",
    "our interest in graphite has deepened much by findings of rich physics not only in pure graphite itself but also in various graphitic materials .",
    "for example , fullerenes@xcite and carbon nanotubes@xcite are regarded as a deformed graphitic structure .",
    "the discoveries have revealed that the topology of @xmath1 carbon networks crucially influences their @xmath0-electronic structures .",
    "an example showing effects of topology is that electronic structures of single wall carbon nanotubes depend on the chiral vectors.@xcite the @xmath0-electronic structures show metallic or semi - conducting behavior .",
    "interestingly , recent experiments confirmed this interplay between the topology of @xmath1 carbons and the @xmath0-electronic states.@xcite    let us start from the graphene to understand the electronic structures of graphite and related materials .",
    "the electronic structure of the graphene around the fermi energy is composed of a @xmath0 ( or @xmath2)-band .",
    "the @xmath0-band and the @xmath2-band are the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band , respectively .",
    "the two bands degenerate at the edge of the first brillouin zone ( 1st bz ) , called k ( or k)-point , and show @xmath3-linear dispersion at these points .",
    "thus , the graphene is a zero - gap semiconductor .",
    "namely , the density of states ( dos ) becomes zero at the fermi energy and linearly increases with leaving from the fermi energy .",
    "another interesting @xmath0-electron system is nanometer - sized graphite called `` nanographite''.@xcite nanographites are a class of mesoscopic systems which are situated between aromatic molecules and graphite . in nanographite ,",
    "the presence of edges , their shapes and size crucially affect their @xmath0-electronic structures .",
    "we introduced ribbon models of a graphene to study effects of the edge on their @xmath0-electronic structures theoretically .",
    "the typical edge shapes are a zigzag edge or an armchair edge .",
    "hence , we investigated zigzag ribbons , which are graphene ribbons with only zigzag edge , and armchair ribbons , which are graphene ribbons with only armchair edge .",
    "there is a clear difference between @xmath0-electronic structures of these two ribbon models . in case of zigzag ribbons ,",
    "a localized states appear around the edge at the fermi energy .",
    "@xcite while such localized states do not exist on the edge of armchair ribbons .",
    "thus appearance of the localized states is a topological effect of zigzag ribbons .",
    "the localized states on zigzag ribbons were named `` edges states '' , because they exist around edges of zigzag ribbons .",
    "a solution of the edge states was constructed on a semi - infinite graphene with a zigzag edge.@xcite this solution shows that the edge states is a non - bonding orbital ( nbo ) .",
    "band structures of zigzag ribbons possess a pair of almost flat bands near the fermi energy .",
    "these flat bands , _ i.e. _ edge states , induce a sharp peak in dos at the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "therefore , zigzag ribbons are expected to show unusual properties , _",
    "e.g. _ spin polarization,@xcite lattice deformation,@xcite magnetic field effects,@xcite transport properties,@xcite _ etc_. the appearance of edge states on zigzag ribbons is also recognized in terms of the first - principles calculations within the framework of the local density approximation.@xcite    now it is natural to ask a question whether other structures which have edge states due to a topological reason exist or not .",
    "this is because interesting phenomena have been found only for zigzag ribbons of a graphene .    in this paper , we report on a method to construct an extension of the graphitic network .",
    "the extended networks possess the same characteristics that the graphene shows both in the topological network and in the electronic structures .",
    "the networks are an ab bipartite network .",
    "when a proper boundary condition is subjected to them , edge states appear in these networks .",
    "besides , the bulk states of these networks become a zero - gap semiconductor . and",
    "the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band degenerate at the fermi energy in 1st bz and the two bands show @xmath3-linear dispersion at the fermi energy .",
    "we name the networks `` hypergraphite '' , because they are regarded as an extension of the graphitic network .",
    "the organization of this paper is the following . in section",
    "ii , we argue about edge states .",
    "in particular , we introduce networks in which edge states appear under a proper boundary condition . in section iii",
    ", we argue about bulk states of these networks by using a numerical calculation and an effective mass approximation . in section iv",
    ", we give a definition of the hypergraphite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to show several networks in which edge states appear .",
    "first , we recall a solution of edge states on a semi - infinite graphene with a zigzag edge .",
    "then we consider the relationship between the topology of zigzag ribbons and the solution of edge states .",
    "this consideration leads us to find a method to construct these networks .",
    "next , we give solutions of edge states which appear in these networks .",
    "we show band structures of slab model of them .    in this section and the next section ,",
    "we use a single - band tight - binding model ( s - tbm ) .",
    "this is because we study the relation between topology of networks and electronic structures .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as @xmath4    where @xmath5 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin , @xmath6 , on the @xmath7-th site ( atom ) .",
    "we let the on - site energy zero , which is always possible for s - tbm . a bond connection is represented by @xmath8 and taken only between connected sites with hopping integral , @xmath9 .",
    "hereafter we assume that the hopping integral , @xmath9 , is unity for simplicity .",
    "and we consider only a paramagnetic state .",
    "in addition , each site is occupied by one electron on the average .",
    "we recall how to construct the solution of the edge states on a semi - infinite graphene with a zigzag edge.@xcite the solution , @xmath10 , is for the @xmath0-electron systems ( fig.1(a ) ) . here ,",

    "each atom at the zigzag edge is assumed to be terminated by a hydrogen atom .",
    "the honeycomb network is ab bipartite and each atomic site can be classified into a- or b - site . in terms of this classification ,",
    "all of the zigzag - edge sites of a semi - infinite graphene is in one of the two sublattices . in this paper , we define sites in the sublattice containing the edge sites as a - sites and sites in the other sublattice as b - sites .",
    "we list some characteristics of @xmath10 .",

    "4 ) the edge state approaches a propagating wave ( @xmath18 ) , when @xmath19 .",
    "this limit , @xmath20 , coincides with bulk states at the k point in bz of the graphene .",
    "a construction method of the solution of the edge states in a semi - infinite graphene with a zigzag edge@xcite is briefly summarized as follows .",
    "we use a notation ( @xmath21 ) , ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) , to specify a site . here",

    "we start from setting a trial function , @xmath27 , to construct the solution of edge states .",

    "particular properties of the electronic structure are 1 ) appearance of edge states under a zigzag surface and 2 ) existence of a @xmath3-line with @xmath3-linear dispersion , and 3 ) being a zero - gap semiconductor . from the above reason",
    ", we regard the class of networks as an extended graphitic network and name them `` hypergraphite '' .",
    "the author would like to thank m. fujita , m. igami , k. wakabayashi , s. okada , k. nakada and k. kusakabe .",
    "numerical calculations were performed on the fujitsu vpp500 of computer center at institute for solid states physics , university of tokyo and the nec sx3 of computer center at institute for molecular science , okazaki national institute .",
    "this work is supported by grant - in - aid for scientific research nos.10309003 and 11740392 from the ministry of education , science and culture , japan .",
    "in this appendix , we show that the edge states appear in a selected class of @xmath34-dimensional networks which are composed of ( @xmath103)-dimensional ab bipartite network . naturally , we consider the @xmath34-dimensional networks which satisfy the conditions of hypergraphite .",
    "we consider a semi - infinite slab model , on which the single - band tight- binding model is constructed . in this model ,",
    "hopping integrals do not have to be unity .",
    "we call an @xmath7-th ( @xmath103)-dimensional network @xmath114 .",
    "( @xmath115 ) it is assumed that there exists a nbo on @xmath116 .",
    "we consider only ab bipartite networks , where 1 ) the number of a - sites and that of b - sites are the same and 2 ) the nbo has a finite amplitude on every a - site of @xmath116 and all of b - sites are node for the nbo . since all of @xmath117 has the same network as that of @xmath116 , all of @xmath117 has a nbo which is the copy of the first nbo .",
    "then , we naturally define a - sites and b - sites on @xmath117 so that b - sites are always node for the nbo . a surface of the network",
    "is composed by only a - sites on @xmath118 .",
    "we also assume that the ( @xmath119)-dimensional ab bipartite network is a lattice having a unit cell and is periodic in all ( @xmath119)-directions .",
    "the numbers of a - sites and b - sites in the unit cell of @xmath114 are equal and represented by @xmath120 .",
    "then , we can obtain wave functions on @xmath114 in a bloch form as , @xmath121 here @xmath93 and @xmath122 represent an ( @xmath103)-dimensional wave vector and a position vector for a unit cell on @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "two labels , @xmath54 and @xmath123 , indicate sublattices ( @xmath124 a or b ) and a site of the @xmath54-sublattice in the cell ( @xmath125 ) , respectively .",
    "an operator , @xmath126 , creates an electron on a site indexed by @xmath54 and @xmath123 in a cell at @xmath122 on @xmath117 .",
    "we introduce an @xmath120-dimensional vector @xmath127 .",
    "then we can rewrite the schrdinger equation on the total @xmath34-dimensional network in a form as , @xmath128 here , matrices , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , are functions of * k*. an ( @xmath131 ) matrix @xmath132 represents the transfer from b - sites to a - sites in @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath130 is another ( @xmath133 ) matrix representing transfers from b - sites in @xmath134 to a - sites in @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath135 is a matrix representing transfers from a - sites to b - sites in @xmath114 .    in the first place",
    ", we discuss the simplest case , _",
    "i.e. _ the unit cell in @xmath117 has only one a site and one b site .",
    "then @xmath136 and @xmath137 become a scalar .",
    "( @xmath138 ) .",
    "we seek for a dumping wave with @xmath139 .",
    "then we have the following equations with a transfer matrix , @xmath140 , @xmath141 @xmath142 with another condition , @xmath143 . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath130 and @xmath132 are not equal to zero .",
    "this is natural because , a ) if @xmath132 is zero , there exists a completely localized edge state for a given @xmath93 , and b ) if @xmath144 , there is no solution with @xmath145 and @xmath143 .",
    "the problem is that on what conditions this set of equations has a dumping wave toward the @xmath13-direction .",
    "if we multiply two transfer matrices , we have , @xmath146 then , we can easily see that a solution can be chosen to satisfy either @xmath147 or @xmath148 .",
    "because @xmath149 to satisfy the boundary condition of edge states , we have a solution , @xmath150 thus , in region of reciprocal lattice space where @xmath93 satisfies @xmath151 , we have a dumping wave . the dumping factor @xmath152 is given by @xmath153 .",
    "next , we have to show that a wave vector satisfying @xmath154 exists in a given network whose @xmath136 and @xmath155 are a scalar .",
    "but , we have assumed that a zero energy states exist on @xmath118 , which is given by * k@xmath156 * satisfying @xmath157 .",
    "namely , this state is a localized eigen - state .",
    "thus existence of a solution with @xmath16 is assumed . in usual networks with finite number of bonds for each site ,",
    "@xmath132 and @xmath130 are analytic functions of @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "hence , one can assume the continuity of @xmath132 ( and @xmath130 ) as a function of @xmath158 .",
    "then we have solutions with @xmath160 , which gives the degenerate edge states .",
    "the graphene and the 3 - 5 network shown in this paper correspond to this simplest case . in case of graphene , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "hence , the dumping factor @xmath11 becomes @xmath163 . while , in case of the 3 - 5 network , @xmath161 and @xmath164 ) . hence , the dumping factor @xmath11 becomes @xmath165 ) .",
    "so far , we have assumed that @xmath166 and @xmath155 are scalars . in general ,",
    "@xmath167s and @xmath155 could be a matrix and a vector , respectively .",
    "then there is a case which @xmath130 become a singular matrix .",
    "hence , it is impossible to derive analogue of eqs.([t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) from eq.([s1 ] ) .",
    "but , we may be able to obtain analogous determination equations for an @xmath34-dimensional network .    in case",
    "when @xmath168 exist , we see that an eigenvector of each a - sites on @xmath169 is given by @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "thus , the eigenvector of each a - sites on @xmath169 is represented by eigenvector of each a - sites on @xmath172 and a dumping factor @xmath11 as , @xmath173 substituting eq.([wf ] ) to eq.([s1 ] ) , we have , @xmath174 the dumping factor , @xmath11 , is determined by this equation .",
    "we can judge whether edge states emerge at an edge of the @xmath34-dimensional network from it .",
    "when @xmath175 , the edge state is completely localized at the surface .",
    "when @xmath176 , the edge state becomes a dumping wave .",
    "when @xmath177 , the state coincides with a bulk state .",
    "when @xmath178 , the solution becomes unphysical .",
