    "the attractive hubbard model ( ahm ) is the standard phenomenological model that describes the transition from a high - temperature metallic or insulating state to a low - temperature superconducting state @xcite .",
    "while the microscopic description requires an explanation for the origin of the effective attraction between electrons @xcite , the nature of the thermally driven transition can be understood within the attractive hubbard framework .",
    "furthermore , the desired symmetry of the superconducting order parameter can be realized by appropriate choice of the attractive interactions , e.g. , an on - site attraction leads to s - wave pairing , a nearest - neighbor ( nn ) attraction gives rise to d - wave pairing , and a next to nn attraction in a two orbital model can describe s@xmath1 and s@xmath2 symmetry @xcite .",
    "more recently , the ahm has also been used to identify topological quantum phase transitions @xcite .    in the limit of weak coupling",
    ", the ahm can be studied within the bcs mean field theory , and it provides a complete understanding of the thermally driven transition , and an accurate prediction for the transition temperatures .",
    "the mean - field theory , however , fails in the strong coupling limit where the transition is controlled by phase fluctuations .",
    "indeed , an effective @xmath3 model for phase fluctuations is used to describe the physics of the strong coupling superconductivity @xcite .",
    "this strong coupling limit is also known as the bec limit where the superconducting phase is understood as a condensate of pre - formed cooper pairs . to describe the crossover from the weak coupling bcs to the strong coupling bec limit within a single framework",
    "is a challenging problem .",
    "various state of the art methods have been employed to gain insight into the behavior of the superconductor across the bcs to bec crossover @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes even more challenging in the presence of impurities , which are always present in materials @xcite .",
    "in fact , disorder as a control parameter has become a powerful concept in understanding some fundamental aspects of superconductivity .",
    "recent discovery of a higgs mode in disordered nbn superconductors is one prominent example @xcite .",
    "intermediate coupling strength demands for a non - perturbative approach , whereas the presence of disorder calls for an accurate treatment of the spatial correlations . the methods that rely on translational invariance of the hamiltonian are not best suited to study the effect of disorder on superconductivity .",
    "therefore , the importance of explicit real - space approach for the study of disordered interacting fermionic systems has been realized in the recent years @xcite .    in this paper , we present a conceptually simple and numerically efficient method for a quantitative description of the finite - temperature behavior of the ahm .",
    "the method treats the weak and the strong @xmath4 regimes on equal footing , and captures the physics of bcs to bec crossover .",
    "we make use of the well known analogy of the superconducting pairing amplitudes ( complex numbers ) with @xmath3 spins .",
    "the parameters of the effective model are calculated by analysing the variations in energy about the mean - field ground state by considering the relevant phase or amplitude fluctuations .",
    "a comparison of @xmath0 estimates with other methods is presented .",
    "a quantitative description of the amplitude and phase fluctuations allows us to determine their relative importance across the bcs to bec crossover .",
    "on the basis of the superconducting order parameter , the quasiparticle density of states and auxiliary field distributions , we describe the metallic , superconducting , insulating and pseudogapped phases .",
    "we find that the pseudogap phase appears close to the insulating phase , consistent with recent experiments on nbn superconductors .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the method works for disordered hamiltonian , and discuss the possible extension to superconductors with non - trivial order - parameter symmetries .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the model and motivate the method .",
    "section iii begins with a detailed justification of the effective hamiltonian method .",
    "this is followed by the presentation and discussions of results obtained via monte carlo simulations within the effective hamiltonian approach .",
    "section iii ends with a demonstration of the applicability of the method for disordered hamiltonians .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "we consider an ahm on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice , given by ,    @xmath5 - u \\sum_{i } n_{i\\uparrow } n_{i\\downarrow } -\\mu \\sum_i n_i , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the interaction between fermions is considered attractive , as specified by the negative sign in front of the @xmath4 term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath8 defines the basic energy scale in the model , and therefore we set @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the chemical potential which controls the average electron density in the system .",
    "for all the results presented in this paper we adjust @xmath10 so as to obtain and average filling of @xmath11 electrons per site .    for a mean - field treatment of this hamiltonian ,",
    "one proceeds by decoupling the interaction term in the pairing channel leading to the well known bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian ,    @xmath12 - \\mu \\sum_i n_i   \\nonumber \\\\   & & -u \\sum_{i } [ \\delta_{i } c^{\\dagger}_{i\\uparrow } c^{\\dagger}_{i\\downarrow } + h.c.],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 denote the local pairing amplitudes , which are complex numbers .",
    "the mean - field solution corresponds to the self - consistent values for the local variables @xmath14 .",
    "note that we do not absorb @xmath4 is the definition of @xmath14 . in the absence of impurities",
    "one can proceed by assuming a homogeneous solution for @xmath14 , and the model can then be solved analytically by making use of the bogoliubov transformations . in general",
    ", one proceeds by numerically diagonalizing @xmath15 and solving for @xmath16 self - consistently , without any a - priori restrictions on them .",
    "the bdg mean - field method correctly captures the bcs solution in the weak coupling limit , and describes the transition temperature and the superconducting gap accurately .",
    "however , in the strong @xmath4 limit it severely overestimates the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is well known that in the strong coupling limit the superconducting order at low temperature can be understood as a bec of pre - formed cooper pairs .",
    "therefore , an effective phase - only model is commonly used to describe the strong coupling limit @xcite . in order to capture the weak to strong coupling crossover",
    ", one needs to go beyond the bdg mean - field scheme .",
    "quantum monte - carlo , which is sign - problem free for the ahm , clearly provides a very accurate way to study the model at arbitrary coupling strength .",
    "however , the method is computationally intensive . in the determinantal qmc algorithm using the suzuki - trotter decomposition , for example",
    ", the simulation scales as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the size of the spatial lattice and @xmath19 is the size of the lattice in the ( matsubara ) time direction .",
    "typical lattice sizes that can be studied using qmc are @xmath20 sites @xcite . therefore , it becomes difficult to analyze effects of disorder on superconductivity using qmc .",
    "another approach that has been proposed for studying models of superconductivity with quenched disorder , is the static - auxiliary - field monte carlo ( saf - mc ) @xcite .",
    "this is a static version of the qmc where the temporal dependence of the auxiliary fields is ignored , and only the spatial dependence is retained .",
    "this method reduces to the bdg mean - field method at @xmath21 , however , it captures the fluctuations in both amplitude and phase of the superconducting order parameters @xmath14 and therefore captures the finite - temperature physics of a superconductor at arbitrary interaction strengths .",
    "the computational time for this method scales as @xmath22 , and therefore one is still severely limited in terms of accessible lattice sizes .",
    "therefore , further approximations are commonly used to achieve larger sizes @xcite . here , we propose that an effective classical hamiltonian @xmath23 can be used to generate configuration for the complex auxiliary field @xmath14 .",
    "these configurations can be generated numerically using the standard importance sampling with metropolis algorithm .",
    "our proposed classical hamiltonian is given by , @xmath24    in the above , @xmath25 , @xmath26 denote the phases of the superconducting amplitudes @xmath14 and @xmath27 at sites @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the temperature - dependent parameter @xmath30 denotes the phase stiffness , which will also be bond dependent in the disordered case .",
    "the term @xmath31 captures the effect of amplitude fluctuations about the mean amplitude value for a given temperature .",
    "the amplitude stiffness parameter , @xmath32 , is in",
    "general dependent on site as well as temperature . for the clean case the phase and amplitude stiffness parameters are spatially uniform .",
    "we further assume that both these parameters are also independent of temperature .",
    "however , it is very important to retain the temperature - dependence of the @xmath33 as will be discussed later . within a semi - classical approach , the physics of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 1 ) can then be described by a combination of @xmath23 and @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath15 describes the response of the fermions to a configuration of classical auxiliary field @xmath14 , and the evolution of the auxiliary field is approximately captured by the classical hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "this approach is similar , in spirit , to the methods proposed for describing magnetism in the double - exchange model @xcite .",
    "the simulations begin at low temperature and we assume the starting state to be a phase coherent superconducting state .",
    "the mean field solution is obtained at each temperature . by analysing the nature of fluctuations around the mean - field solution , as will be discussed in the next section , we define the parameters for the @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting @xmath23 is then simulated via monte carlo , and electronic properties are obtained by using the configurations for @xmath34 into @xmath15 .",
    "metropolis algorithm with the standard single - site updates is employed for simulations .",
    "most of the results presented here are obtained on a square lattice with @xmath35 sites .",
    "number of monte carlo steps used for equilibration and averaging of quantities involving classical auxiliary variables is @xmath36 .",
    "since electronic properties require a solution of schroedinger equation for each configuration , thermal averaging for electronic properties is performed over @xmath37 monte carlo steps .",
    "we begin by analyzing the nature of fluctuations about the bdg mean - field solution of the ahm . given the complex nature of the variables",
    "@xmath38 we can compute the change in energy caused by the variation in the phases @xmath25 and that caused by the change in amplitudes @xmath39 . in order to provide a simple geometrical picture ,",
    "the @xmath34 can be viewed as two dimensional ( 2d ) rotors of variable length @xmath39 .",
    "it is well known that in the strong coupling limit , @xmath3 model captures the physics of phase fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the simplest scalar that can be constructed from two vectors is their dot product .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the change in energy due to relative change of orientation between pairs of rotors is described by the first term in @xmath23 eq .",
    "( 3 ) , _ i.e. _ ,    @xmath40    where , in principle , all pairs @xmath41 can contribute to the summation . the task is now to determine the coupling constants @xmath42 , which in a translationally invariant system should only depend on the distance between sites @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "suppose @xmath43 is the energy of the self - consistent bdg solution that in the rotor picture corresponds to all rotors pointing in the same direction , say @xmath44 .",
    "now we change the orientation of the rotor at the @xmath45 site by an angle @xmath46 so that @xmath47 , and compute the change in energy @xmath48 . within the effective rotor model , @xmath49",
    ", this change must be attributed to the change in bonds that connect @xmath45 site to all other sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( @xmath50 ) ) .",
    "next , we restore the orientation of the @xmath45 rotor back to @xmath51 , and change the orientation of the rotor at the @xmath52 site by the same angle @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( @xmath53 ) ) .",
    "this leads to a change in energy @xmath54 which is coming from the change in bonds that are connecting the @xmath52 site to all other sites .",
    "clearly , for a translationally invariant system we should have @xmath55 .",
    "then we orient both the @xmath45 and the @xmath52 rotors at an angle @xmath46 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath56 .",
    "the change is energy obtained in this configuration is @xmath57 .",
    "the change in this case is coming from the change in all the bonds connecting @xmath45 and @xmath52 rotors to all other rotors , except to each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( @xmath58 ) ) .",
    "therefore , we can identify the coupling strength between the @xmath45 and the @xmath52 rotors as , @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "using this protocol for calculating the coupling constants , we can also compute the longer - range coupling strengths . note that we are not assuming that only nn bonds contribute to the summation in eq .",
    "( 3 ) . in fact",
    ", the present scheme for calculating the @xmath42 shows explicitly that the most important coupling is that between the nearest neighbor @xmath61 pairs .",
    "moreover , the protocol proposed above for computing coupling strengths also works for a disordered system , where @xmath42 will now depend on the sites @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and therefore we will get a distribution of coupling strengths even for nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "we begin by verifying the validity of the @xmath62 form that is assumed in the effective classical hamiltonian .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the numerical data for change in energy @xmath63 as a function of angle of orientation @xmath46 for different values of attractive hubbard parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath64 fits the numerical data very well for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "the best - fit parameter @xmath65 is much larger than @xmath66 , therefore in the simplest approximation we retain only the @xmath67 form in the effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 3 ) . in order to compute the values of the coupling parameters @xmath42 one",
    "can either use the best - fit values as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] or any two points from the numerical data .    following an analogous approach",
    "we justify the use of second term in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "this term can be written as @xmath68 , and represents the stiffness to the change in magnitude of the local pairing amplitude compared to the average magnitude in the self - consistent solution .",
    "given the on - site nature of this term , it is easier to compute the change in energy .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . shows the change in energy due to the change in the length of the rotor for different @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the function @xmath69 fits the numerical data very well hence justifying the form of the second term in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the rotor picture for the superconducting amplitudes is strictly valid in the large @xmath4 limit .",
    "this is analogous to how in the repulsive hubbard model a local magnetic moment is well - defined only in the large @xmath4 limit .",
    "therefore , an alternate approach is used to find the phase stiffness constant in the small @xmath4 regime .",
    "this is obtained from the the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator @xcite .    in the following ,",

    "the values obtained via the best - fit to the cosine form ( filled squares in fig [ fig4](@xmath50 ) ) and those obtained by using only @xmath70 on the cosine curve ( open symbols ) match very well . in the large @xmath4 limit",
    ", we find that @xmath71 as expected from the strong coupling expansion ( dashed line in fig [ fig4](@xmath50 ) ) . for @xmath72 , @xmath65 decreases upon decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "this indicates a breakdown of the local description for the superconducting amplitudes as the phase stiffness at weak coupling should not go to zero in a superconducting phase .",
    "indeed , the phase stiffness computed as the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator approaches a constant value of around @xmath73 . in the intermediate to large",

    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath75 , and seems to be a good approximation for the stiffness constant over the entire @xmath4 range .",
    "we define the superconducting order parameter at finite temperature by , @xmath76 , where the angular brackets denote thermal averaging over monte carlo configurations of auxiliary variables and @xmath18 is the number of sites .",

    "the transition temperature displays a non - monotonic behavior with varying @xmath4 ( see fig . [ fig5](@xmath50 ) ) . the sharp reduction in @xmath79 across @xmath0",
    "is caused by the vanishing of @xmath80 for small @xmath4 , and by randomness in phases @xmath25 for large @xmath4 .",
    "these two limits are connected smoothly with variation in @xmath4 , as will be discussed in detail in the following .    a useful quantity that determines the importance of the phase of the superconducting order parameter is the vorticity @xcite .",
    "vorticity ( antivorticity ) can be defined as the sum of difference of phases around a square plaquette taken clockwise ( anticlockwise ) and summed over all plaquettes .",
    "the difference in angles @xmath81 is defined modulo @xmath82 .",
    "the density of vortices and anti - vortices ( @xmath83 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( @xmath53 ) . in the weak coupling regime",
    "there are no vortex / antivortex excitations as the system goes across the transition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( @xmath53 ) for @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "this shows that the transition is caused solely by fluctuations in amplitudes of the local superconducting order parameters @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , for intermediate to large values of @xmath4 , density of vortices begins to rise near the transition temperature as determined from @xmath79 .",
    "this is consistent with previous results obtained in the extreme large @xmath4 limit , where one can assume the magnitudes @xmath80 to be constant and the fluctuations are captured by a phase - only @xmath3 model @xcite .    the electronic spectrum is obtained in the monte carlo generated auxiliary field configurations by solving for @xmath15 eq .",
    "one of the important features contained in the electronic spectra is the spectral gap , which we define as the energy difference between lowest unoccupied level and highest occupied level assuming a @xmath21 fermi distribution function .",
    "the spectral gap normalized to the value of @xmath4 is plotted in fig . [ fig5 ] ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the temperature dependence shows that the gap vanishes at @xmath0 for small values of @xmath4 , whereas it remains finite even in the non - superconducting regime for intermediate to large values of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath0 obtained in present study is consistent with the bcs result for small @xmath4 and a strong coupling @xmath86 behavior for large @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( @xmath87 ) ) .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar to those obtained by the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , qmc and other computationally demanding methods .",
    "the quantitative features are as follows .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath0 is @xmath88 , and occurs near @xmath89 . within various methods",

    "although the maximum value of @xmath0 and the corresponding @xmath4 value should both depend on the average electron density , within qmc this dependence is insignificant in the density range @xmath97 , and hence the above comparison is meaningful despite the different values on @xmath98 used in different studies @xcite .",
    "the introduction of an effective classical hamiltonian for auxiliary fields has two - fold advantage .",
    "firstly , it facilitates the application of the monte carlo procedure , secondly , the behavior of auxiliary variables provides additional insight into the nature of the finite - temperature transitions . in order to further understand the difference between the superconducting to normal state transitions at weak and strong coupling",

    "the coherence length @xmath124 is defined via @xcite ,    @xmath125    where @xmath126 , and @xmath127 denotes a site located at distance @xmath128 from site @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig11](@xmath50 ) shows the temperature dependence of pair coherence length for different values of @xmath4 . for small values of @xmath4 ,",
    "the coherence length decreases with temperature , and @xmath129 in agreement with previous calculations @xcite . with increasing @xmath4",
    ", @xmath124 reduces rapidly and becomes essentially temperature - independent . note that @xmath130 for @xmath131 indicates that the cooper pairs have essentially become well localized in this regime of interaction strength .",
    "we further test the three basic scenarios of fluctuations in auxiliary variables for the pair coherence length .",
    "we compare the results obtained for the pair coherence length in the monte carlo simulations , with those obtained by considering three types of idealized auxiliary variable configurations that are already discussed for the dos .",
    "we find that for small values of @xmath4 , our monte carlo simulation results for @xmath124 are very close to those obtained in the amplitude - only fluctuation model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig11](@xmath53 ) ) . in the large @xmath4 regime ,",
    "the monte carlo results are closest to the phase - only fluctuation model . in the intermediate range , @xmath132 ,",
    "the coherence length is best described by the fluctuations in both @xmath133 and @xmath134 these results indicate that the monte carlo method faithfully captures the crossover from amplitude - only fluctuation regime at small @xmath4 to the @xmath3-model regime at large @xmath4 .",
    "we summarize the results obtained so far in a phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the @xmath101-@xmath4 phase diagram as obtained within our simulations consists of four distinct phases , namely , sc , normal metal , non - sc gapped , and pseudogapped .",
    "this is consistent with results obtained via more sophisticated numerical techniques .",
    "the pseudogapped state can be understood as an indicator for the presence of both the phase and the amplitude fluctuations .",
    "the turn - around of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath4 curve , which is located close to the bcs behavior within our calculations , can be considered as an indicator for the on - set of significant phase fluctuations .",
    "this is why the region just above @xmath0 shows pseudogapped dos . as @xmath4 increases ,",
    "the phase fluctuations become dominant , however the amplitude fluctuations become inactive only when @xmath4 is considerably large .",
    "the dos remains gapped as long as amplitude fluctuations are absent , and at higher @xmath101 when both amplitude and phase are random , a pseudogap phase appears .",
    "the pseudogap phase is likely to disappear at a scale proportional to @xmath4 itself , where the pairing amplitudes themselves vanish and therefore , the phase of the order parameter can not be defined . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ( @xmath53 ) we show the plot of @xmath135 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the plot begins to deviate from the bcs value of @xmath136 , ( as indicated by the horizontal dashed line ) around @xmath137 .",
    "we also show @xmath138 as a function of @xmath4 . in the bcs scenario , @xmath139 which we find to hold for @xmath140 .",
    "these two indicators of bcs behavior suggest that the deviation from a bcs like superconducting order begins somewhere between @xmath85 and @xmath141 . however , there is no critical value of @xmath4 for which the behavior deviates from the bcs behavior .",
    "although disorder is present to varying degrees in almost all materials , its effect is typically ignored in the simplest treatment .",
    "indeed , translational invariance is commonly invoked in theories of condensed matter systems . in the context of superconductors",
    ", however , disorder plays a crucial role in providing a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms .",
    "indeed , there has been immense interest in studying disordered superconductors , both bulk and thin films , in recent years @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use disorder as a control parameter which then provides new insights into the understanding of correlated electron physics .",
    "hence , methods that can treat the effect of disorder accurately become extremely useful .",
    "this is where the real - space methods hold an edge over the variety of mean - field methods .",
    "having shown that the real - space method proposed in section ii of this paper recovers the physics of thermal fluctuations in both , the amplitude and the phase of the superconducting order , we now demonstrate that the scheme can applied to disordered hamiltonians . in order to proceed ,",
    "we use the prototype model for disorder and extend our hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 1 ) by adding a random on - site energy term .",
    "the resulting disordered hamiltonian is given by ,    @xmath142    where , @xmath143 are random variables selected from a uniform box distribution of width @xmath144 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath145 .",
    "the additional term effects both @xmath15 eq .",
    "( 2 ) and @xmath23 eq ( 3 ) .",
    "the change in @xmath15 is simply the addition of the term @xmath146 to eq .",
    "the change in @xmath23 arises via the change in the parameters of the effective hamiltonian . since translational symmetry is broken by the disorder term , the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath147 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) become site dependent .",
    "however , even before arriving at the effective parameters , we need to verify the validity of the form of the effective hamiltonian eq ( 3 ) .",
    "we show the dependence of the change in energy on the rotation angle for all nn pair of sites .",
    "since our primary task is to identify the functional form of @xmath148 , we plot the change in energies normalized to the change for largest value of @xmath46 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath149 for all nn pairs .",
    "the resulting plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] for a few representative values of @xmath4 and @xmath144 .",
    "while there is a broadening due to disorder , the overall shape of the curve is reasonably well approximated by a cosine function .",
    "interestingly , the deviation from the cosine behavior is large for intermediate values of @xmath4 . for large @xmath144",
    ", the cosine curve passes through the scatter of points corresponding to @xmath148 for different nn pairs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ( @xmath53 ) , ( @xmath87 ) , ( @xmath150 ) ) .",
    "note that the fit does not appear as good as that in the clean case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) because we are not using additional fit parameter , @xmath66 , in this case . in principle",
    ", more parameters can be introduced in @xmath151 in order to improve the model , however , our aim here is to demonstrate the working of the general scheme and therefore we leave this task of quantitative improvements for future .",
    "the results presented for the disordered case are averaged over @xmath152 realizations of disorder .    the distribution of parameters is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "both @xmath42 and @xmath147 acquire a broad distribution for finite values of @xmath144 .",
    "interestingly , for large @xmath4 the coupling strengths @xmath42 do not become larger than the disorder - free value of @xmath65 .",
    "for the stiffness constant , @xmath153 for all values of disorder strength and @xmath4 , and for all sites . the method employed here for calculating @xmath42 can also be useful in the study of quantum @xmath3 models where the common practice is to select @xmath42 from random uncorrelated distributions @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo simulations proceed as in the case of disorder - free hamiltonian , except that in the present case the parameters @xmath147 and @xmath42 of @xmath23 are site and bond dependent , respectively . from the behavior of the parameters for @xmath151 in the presence of disorder",
    ", we can already argue that the fluctuations in both the amplitude and the phase of the superconducting order parameter are enhanced by disorder .",

    "the behavior of the system for different values of @xmath144 and @xmath101 is summarized in two phase diagrams ( see fig . [ fig15](@xmath58)-(@xmath87 ) ) . for intermediate @xmath4 ,",
    "the sc order is destabilized with increasing temperature , giving way to a non - superconducting phase with finite spectral gap .",
    "this phase can be considered as a phase with trapped copper pairs . with further increase in @xmath101 ,",
    "the non - sc gapped phases evolves into a pseudogapped phase ( see fig . [ fig15](@xmath58 ) ) .",
    "this phase suggests that the cooper pairs are not very robust and are at the verge of breaking into normal electrons . for strong @xmath4 ,",
    "the non - sc gapped state is stable over wider region in @xmath101-@xmath144 space .",
    "the qmc studies on ahm in two dimensions indicate an existence of a superconductor to insulator transition ( sit ) upon increasing disorder strength @xcite . the critical value of @xmath156 for @xmath157 is found to lie between @xmath158 and @xmath159 for @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "the results obtained within our monte carlo method are consistent with the previous results .",
    "the critical value of disorder required for sit increases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "the pseudogap region , expands with increasing the strength of disorder for weak disorder , and reduces upon further increasing the disorder .",
    "we have introduced an effective hamiltonian based monte - carlo method for studying disordered ahm .",
    "the method is inspired by the ideas presented by j. hubbard in phys .",
    "b * 16 * , 2626 ( 1979 ) in the context of repulsive hubbard model .",
    "the interacting hamiltonian is replaced by , ( i ) an effective classical hamiltonian that controls the fluctuations of the auxiliary fields , and ( ii ) a hamiltonian describing electrons in arbitrary potential arising due to the auxiliary field configurations .",
    "the parameters of the classical hamiltonian are determined from the behavior of energy variation about the bdg mean - field solutions .",
    "the results presented for the disorder - free hamiltonian are quantitatively close to those reported in studies utilizing more sophisticated methods , such as , qmc , dmft and saf - mc .",
    "the effective hamiltonian approach also provides additional insights into the behavior of the ahm .",
    "the distribution of the auxiliary fields and their evolution with @xmath4 and @xmath101 can be used to make inference about the nature of the finite temperature phase transitions .",
    "we find that while the small @xmath4 ( large @xmath4 ) limit is dominated by amplitude ( phase ) fluctuations as expected in the bcs ( bec ) scenario , both amplitude and phase fluctuations contribute significantly to the thermally induced suppression of superconductivity in the intermediate @xmath4 regime .",
    "the pseudogap phase exists in this regime just above @xmath0 when both amplitude and phase fluctuations are active .",
    "this agrees well with the recent experimental findings in nbn superconductors .",
    "the advantage of the method lies in the fact that a purely classical monte carlo method can be employed to generate auxiliary field configurations at finite temperatures .",
    "accessibility of large lattice sizes makes this a powerful method to study the effect of disorder on superconductivity . to this end",
    ", we demonstrate that the method can indeed be used for disordered hamiltonians .",
    "the parameters of the effective hamiltonian become site- and bond - dependent in the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "the effect of disorder is to enhance fluctuations in both the amplitude and phase variables .",
    "the observation of pseudogap in disordered s - wave superconductors is consistent with our inference that the pseudogap state is an indicator for the presence of fluctuations in both phase and amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "it will be an interesting future direction to explore the extension of our schemes to include superconducting phases with non - trivial order - parameter symmetries such as @xmath87-wave , @xmath161-wave , etc .",
    "the general idea of building an effective hamiltonian by analysing the change in energy about the bdg mean - field state should work , provided one can identify the relevant auxiliary fields that describe the low - energy fluctuations .",
