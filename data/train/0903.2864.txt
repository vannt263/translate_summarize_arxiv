    "<S> our third theorem concerns the permutation modules whose ordinary characters appear in theorem  [ thm : main ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that , by ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem  3.5 ) , these are exactly the permutation modules whose centralizer algebra is abelian . to understand the statement of this theorem the reader will need to know a little about specht modules : see ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * chapters  4 ,  5 ) for an introduction . </S>",
    "<S> we recall here that if  @xmath81 is the integral specht module for  @xmath82 labelled by the partition  @xmath4 of  @xmath2 then , regarding the entries of the representing matrices as rational numbers ,  @xmath81 affords the ordinary irreducible character  @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> if , instead , we regard the entries as elements of a field @xmath83 of prime characteristic , then the resulting module for @xmath84 , denoted simply @xmath85 , is usually no longer irreducible  indeed , determining the composition factors of specht modules in prime characteristic is one of the main unsolved problems in modular representation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we say that an @xmath84-module @xmath86 has a _ specht filtration _ if there is a chain of submodules @xmath87 such that each successive quotient is isomorphic to a specht module .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : mod ] let @xmath83 be an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic  @xmath88 and let @xmath36 . if  @xmath37 is a subgroup of  @xmath1 such that the ordinary permutation character @xmath89 is multiplicity - free , then each summand of the permutation module @xmath90 is a self - dual module with a specht filtration . </S>",
    "<S> the specht module @xmath85 for  @xmath84 appears in a specht filtration of @xmath91 if and only if @xmath3 is a constituent of the ordinary character @xmath89 .    </S>",
    "<S> the author first suspected the existence of this theorem after reading paget s paper  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> s main result is that the permutation modules coming from case ( c ) of theorem  [ thm : main ] have a specht filtration , with the expected specht factors . </S>",
    "<S> it is a simple matter to adapt her work to deal with case  ( d ) .    in  4 </S>",
    "<S> we show that if @xmath83 is an algebraically closed field of characteristic  @xmath32 then @xmath92 does not have a specht filtration . </S>",
    "<S> this gives an interesting example of a permutation module in odd prime characteristic without a specht filtration . </S>",
    "<S> using more sophisticated techniques , mikaelian has constructed a family of examples of such modules for fields of characteristic @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of such modules is a clear indication that results such as theorem  [ thm : mod ] can not be obtained by any routine ` reduction mod @xmath93 ' argument .    </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary investigation has shown that the situation in characteristic  @xmath30 is still more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected on theoretical grounds : see  @xcite and  @xcite for an introduction to the general theory of specht filtrations . to demonstrate the difficulties of working in characteristic  @xmath30 we end  4 by showing that although the module @xmath94 has a specht filtration , it _ does not _ have a specht filtration with the specht factors indicated by its ordinary character . </S>"
