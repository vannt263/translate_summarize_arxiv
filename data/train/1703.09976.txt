    "in addition , for the damping case the average velocity decreases monotonously with increasing @xmath69 and for the very weak damping case there exists an optimal value of @xmath69 at which the average velocity is maximal .",
    "current reversals can provide a tool for controlling and manipulating the motion of self - propelled particles in complex and crowded environments .",
    "we expect that our results open the way for novel rectification ( or separation ) devices of active matter based on underdamped dynamics .",
    "though the present model is very simple , the results we have presented could open up a new aspect of active matter ratchet systems .",
    "this active ratchet could be realized in some real active matter systems at the high reynolds number regime(also with low schmidt number ) such as sphere janus particles in a dusty plasm , colloidal particles in air , granular matter in dilute systems , and so on .",
    "the present analysis can be easily extended to more complex situations in the future .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to add collective effects to study competing effects of inertia versus interaction in terms of reversals .",
    "another interesting extension is particle separation by using interacting inertial ratchets .",
    "finally , it is also interesting to study whether other non - dissipative dynamics , such as magnus forces , could come into play .",
