    "during the last decade much attention has been devoted to theoretical and experimental investigations of the pionic double charge exchange ( @xmath17dcx ) process on nuclei .",
    "because this reaction @xmath18 involves ( at least ) two nucleons in the nucleus , the @xmath17dcx cross section depends sensitively on short - range nn - correlations in nuclei .",
    "therefore , it provides a good testing ground for the nucleon - nucleon interaction at short range .",
    "experiments on different nuclear targets have unambiguously confirmed the existence of a narrow resonance - like structure in the @xmath17dcx cross - section at small incident pion energies @xmath19 mev @xcite .",
    "the position of this peak turned out to be largely independent of the studied nucleus .",
    "the height and width of this peak could not be explained by standard calculations based on the two - step process @xcite ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "so far , these data could only be explained with the assumption of a non - nucleonic reaction mechanism @xcite proceeding via an intermediate dibaryon resonance , henceforth called @xmath1 .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 dibaryon candidate were determined as j@xmath2=0@xmath3 , t=0 , and its free mass and hadronic decay width were suggested to be @xmath10=2.065 gev and @xmath21 0.5 mev .",

    "@xcite predicted a dibaryon resonance with quantum numbers @xmath22=@xmath23 , t=0 and a mass @xmath24 mev within the mit bag model .",
    "recently , this dibaryon candidate has been investigated in a series of works @xcite within the tbingen chiral constituent quark model .",
    "these works emphasize the crucial role of the confinement mechanism for the existence of the @xmath1 .",
    "the quantum numbers j@xmath2=0@xmath3 , t=0 of the @xmath1 resonance prevent the decay into two nucleons and the only allowed hadronic decay channel of the @xmath1 is the three - body decay into a @xmath25 system with s - waves in each particle - pair @xcite . because the @xmath1 mass @xmath26 is only @xmath27 mev above the @xmath25 threshold , the @xmath1 decay width @xmath28 should be anomalously small owing to a very small phase volume of three - particle final states .",
    "we recall that the currently available experimental evidence of dibaryon excitations in nuclei is very limited @xcite .",
    "this is due to very large n - n decay widths of most dibaryon resonances , which renders them undetectable on the background of other hadronic processes at intermediate energy . at present , the experimental evidence for narrow dibaryons is reduced to a single candidate , the @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast to the deuteron , which consists of two on the average widely separated nucleons , there are indications @xcite , that the @xmath1 is a rather pure , compound six - quark system .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of its hadronic decay into the @xmath17nn system should be sensitive to the overlap region of the two outgoing nucleons ; a situation that is ideal for understanding the role of quark degrees of freedom in the short - range nucleon - nucleon interaction ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "starting from this point ( for alternative approaches see in refs .",
    "@xcite ) we consider the @xmath1 decay as a ( quark ) shell - model transition from one six - quark configuration to another one by emitting a pion .",
    "the quark line diagram of the decay is sketched in figure [ figure : obufig1 ] .",
    "the calculation of the transition matrix elements @xmath0 is similar to the calculation of @xmath30-isobar - decay matrix elements @xmath31 ( spin and isospin flip of a quark ) . in the case of the @xmath1 decay",
    "only the initial dibaryon state is a definite six - quark configuration ( the lowest shell - model configuration with quantum numbers j@xmath2=0@xmath3 , t=0 ) , whereas the final state consists of a continuum of nn - states which have to be projected onto a basis of six - quark configurations with quantum numbers j@xmath2=0@xmath32 , t=1 of the nn @xmath33 wave .",
    "the main difficulty in comparing the calculated width @xmath34 with experimental data is its sharp dependence on the energy gap between @xmath26 and the @xmath17nn threshold",
    ". a reliable result on @xmath28 can be obtained only if the exact mass @xmath26 in vacuum is known ( e.g.  from electroexcitation of the @xmath1 on the deuteron at large momentum transfers @xcite ) . at present , we have only indirect data in the nuclear medium @xcite . due to the absence of vacuum data ,",
    "we investigate the problem of the @xmath1 decay width starting from theoretical quark - model results @xcite for @xmath26 and the hadronic @xmath1 size parameter @xmath35 .",
    "our first calculation for @xmath28 was published in ref .",
    "the aim of the present work is to improve mainly on three important effects which were neglected in ref .",

    "the tabakin model leads again to values of @xmath28 , which are even smaller than @xmath28 in the plane wave approximation neglecting f.s.i .",

    "not surprisingly , the small available phase space in the three - body decay is the dominant mechanism for the narrow width of the @xmath1 . the large identity factor ( 15 ) , on the other hand , enhances the results of previous evaluations disregarding the identity of quarks from different nucleons .",
    "the inclusion of all pauli principle allowed intermediate 2@xmath4 shell - model configurations tends to increase the decay width by some 20  30 @xmath232 .",

    "this qualitatively agrees with the experimentally suggested value @xmath28 = 0.5 mev .    despite the fact that both , the tabakin and ueda f.s.i .",
    "models , are unsuitable for large nn energies ( as in parameter sets 1 , 2 and 4 ) , the two models demonstrate the strong influence of the short - range behavior of the nn wave function on the @xmath1 decay width .",
    "( see e.  g.  figs .",
    "[ figure : obufig2 ] and [ figure : obufig3 ] ) . recall that these two models are typical representatives of qualitatively different classes of nn phenomenology .",
    "whereas the ueda separable potential is an approximation of the obep , i.  e.  a model with short - range repulsion , the tabakin potential can be considered as a unitary - pole approximation ( upa ) @xcite of a moscow - type potential model @xcite with short - range attraction and forbidden states .",
    "the moscow model proceeds from the assumption of a six - quark origin of the short - range nn interaction and pretends to give an adequate description of the non - local character of the nn force .",
    "the main conclusion to be drawn here is , that these two models , which are phase equivalent , differ considerably in their effect on the @xmath1 decay width .",
    "therefore , a possible @xmath1 dibaryon would provide a natural laboratory for detailed studies of the short - range nn interaction .",
    "an interesting continuation of this work would be to go beyond phenomenological nn potential models and use a completely microscopic quark model approach ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . for example , one could calculate the pionic decay of the @xmath1 dibaryon using a final @xmath254 nn - scattering wave function that is based on the same microscopic quark hamiltonian which simultaneously describes the mass @xmath26 and structure of the @xmath1 dibaryon .",
    "however , such a calculation is complicated by the fact that we have used two different hamiltonians , i.  e.   two different confinement strengths , for three - quark baryons and the six - quark @xmath1 dibaryon @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 dibaryon could not be explained in terms of the standard constituent quark model , using a common hamiltonian for any number of quarks .",
    "on the other hand , if the @xmath216 really exists , this may be taken as an indication that the effective ( nonperturbative ) quark - quark interaction depends on the state of the system .      in this appendix",
