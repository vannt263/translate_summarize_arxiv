    "the phenomenological theory of normal fermi liquids at zero temperature was proposed by l.d .",

    "migdal made the very important observation that a jump in the particle momentum distribution at the fermi momentum corresponds to a pole of the fermion green s function in the normal fermi liquid and is preserved even in the strongly interacting system @xcite .",
    "the presence of the pole contribution to the fermion green s function allowed galitsky and migdal to develop the green s function formalism for many - body fermionic systems , see ref .",
    "these concepts were first elaborated on example of low - lying particle - hole excitations in fermi liquids .",

    "standard feynman technique of summation of squared matrix elements of reactions fails to calculate reaction rates in the medium , since in general case there are no asymptotic states for source particles in matter .",
    "indeed , source particles continue to collide before and after radiation of a quantum .",
    "this gives rise to finite imaginary parts of the self - energy functions ( particle widths ) .",
    "if one naively replaced the summation of all perturbative feynman diagrams ( with free green s functions ) by the summation of corresponding diagrams with dressed green s functions , it would lead to a double counting due to multiple repetitions of some processes ( for an extensive discussion of how one can treat this defect see @xcite ) .",
    "this calls for a formalism dealing with closed diagrams ( integrated over all possible in - medium particle states ) with full non - equilibrium green s functions .",
    "such a general formalism was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . it treats on equal footing one - fermion and multi - fermion processes as well as resonance reaction contributions of the boson origin , such as processes with participation of zero sounds and reactions on the boson condensates .",
    "decomposition of diagrams is done in terms of the full @xmath4 green s functions ( wigner densities ) .",
    "each diagram in the series with full green s functions is free from the infrared divergencies .",
    "in such a way one generalizes landau - pomeranchuk - migdal treatment of the multiple scattering on external centers to the treatment of the multiple scattering in matter .",
    "both , the correct quasi - particle and quasi - classical limits are recovered .",

    "@xcite this approach was called the _ `` optical theorem formalism''_. in refs .  @xcite it was demonstrated that the standard calculations of reaction rates via integration of squared reaction matrix elements and the results of the optical theorem formalism match exactly , provided conditions for the quasi - particle approximation for fermions are fulfilled . formally the matching is done by cutting the closed diagrams . in general case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite going beyond the quasi - particle approximation , the series of closed diagrams is constructed with respect to the number of the @xmath4 green s functions . for low temperatures",
    "each @xmath4 line brings extra @xmath5 factor in the production rate of the radiating quanta , @xmath6 is the fermi energy . in ref .  @xcite the relations between reaction rates at finite widths and the quasi - particle rates were found .",
    "all real calculations of fermion superfluids were performed within quasi - particle approximation for fermions ( when fermion width is much less than all other relevant energetic scales ) .",
    "below we focus on the larkin - migdal approach to the cold fermion superfluids and formulate it in terms of the schwinger - kadanoff - baym - keldysh technique to describe fermion superfluids in equilibrium at @xmath2 and out of equilibrium .",
    "physics of neutron star cooling is based on a number of ingredients , among which the neutrino emissivity of the high - density hadronic matter in the star core is the important one .",
    "after the first tens of seconds ( at most hours ) , the typical temperature of a neutron star decreases below the so - called neutrino - opacity temperature @xmath7  mev . at these conditions",
    "neutrinos and anti - neutrinos can be radiated directly from the star interiors without subsequent rescattering , since their mean - free path is much longer than the star radius  @xcite .",
    "hence , the star can be considered as a piece of a warm `` white '' body for neutrinos .",
    "typical averaged lepton energy ( @xmath8 several @xmath9 ) is much larger than the nucleon particle width @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the nucleons can be treated within the quasi - particle approximation .",
    "this observation simplifies consideration essentially .",
    "one usually follows an intuitive way for the separation of the processes according to their phase spaces .",
    "the one - nucleon processes ( if they are not forbidden by the energy - momentum conservation ) have the largest emissivity , @xmath11 for non - superfluid systems , then two - nucleon processes come into play , @xmath12 , and so on . in the optical theorem formalism",
    "one - nucleon processes are determined by the self - energy @xmath13 of virtual @xmath14 and @xmath15 bosons expanded in the series with respect to the number , @xmath16 , of @xmath17 loops with full @xmath18 and @xmath19 vertices .",
    "the @xmath20 diagrams correspond to one - nucleon processes , the @xmath21 diagrams to the two - nucleon processes , etc .    in the",
    "so - called _",
    "`` standard scenario '' _ of the neutron star cooling , the processes were calculated without taking into account in - medium effects .",
    "it was argued that the most important channel at temperatures up to @xmath22@xmath23  k is the modified urca ( mu ) process @xmath24 .",
    "first estimates of the mu emissivity were done in @xcite . in ref",
    ".  @xcite b.  friman and o.v .",
    "maxwell recalculated the emissivity of this process in the model , where the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction was approximated by a free one - pion exchange ( fope ) .",
    "the expression of the neutrino emissivity obtained by them was used in various computer simulations , e.g. , in refs .  @xcite . besides the mu process , the _",
    "`` standard scenario '' _ includes also the processes of the nucleon ( neutron and proton ) bremsstrahlung ( nb ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which contributions to the emissivity is smaller than those of the mu processes , see refs .",
    "the density dependence of the reaction rates calculated with the fope is rather weak and the neutrino radiation from a neutron star depends very weakly on the star mass",
    ".    there exists another class of so - called `` exotic '' processes , which occur only if some special condition is fulfilled , i.e. when the nucleon density exceeds some critical values .",
    "these are the direct urca ( du ) processes on nucleons ( e.g. , @xmath27 ) and hyperons @xcite , pion urca reactions on a pion condensate @xcite , kaon urca processes on a kaon condensate @xcite , @xmath3-urca processes on charged @xmath3-condensates @xcite , du processes on quarks @xcite , du processes on fermion condensates @xcite .",
    "the values of critical densities are different for various processes and are model dependent .",
    "for example , some relativistic mean - field models produce the critical density of the du reaction , @xmath28 as low as the nuclear saturation density @xmath29  @xmath30 .",
    "however , the realistic , microscopically - based urbana - argone equation of state  @xcite yields @xmath31 .",
    "the simulations of the neutron star cooling history in refs .",
    "@xcite have shown that the occurrence of the du processes in the neutron star with masses @xmath32 would lead to problems with the explanation of soft @xmath33-ray data .",
    "the constraint on the equation of state of the dense nuclear matter , requiring a sufficiently high value of @xmath28 , was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and explored in details in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the neutrino emission from dense hadronic component in neutron stars is subject of strong modifications due to collective effects in the nuclear matter .",
    "many new reaction channels open up in medium in comparison to the vacuum . in refs .",
    "@xcite the nucleon - nucleon interaction was considered within the landau ",
    "migdal approach to fermi liquids .",
    "the softening of the in - medium one - pion exchange ( mope ) mode and other medium polarization effects , like nucleon - nucleon correlations in the vertices , renormalization of the local part of @xmath34 interaction due to loop effects , as well as a possibility of the neutrino emission from intermediate reaction states and du - like reactions involving zero sounds and boson condensates were incorporated .",
    "it was demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , that for @xmath35 the neutrino emissivity is mainly determined by the medium modified urca ( mmu ) process , in which the neutrino is radiated from the intermediate reaction states .",
    "this fact changes significantly the absolute value and the density dependence of the @xmath36 process rate .",
    "the latter becomes very strong .",
    "therefore , for neutron stars with larger masses the resulting emissivity of the mmu process proves to be substantially higher than the corresponding value ( mu ) calculated in the fope model of ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the medium - modified nucleon bremsstrahlung ( mnb ) processes yield a smaller contribution than mmu ones since the former does not include the neutrino radiation from intermediate states , e.g. from intermediate pion",
    ". however , the mnb processes are more efficient than the nb ones for such densities .",
    "oppositely , for @xmath38 the in - medium effects can moderately suppress the two - nucleon reaction rates compared with those given by the fope model  @xcite .",
    "the pion softening effect disappears at @xmath39@xmath40 , see refs .",
    "@xcite , but the nucleon - nucleon short - range repulsion effect remains .",
    "inclusion of the nucleon - nulceon correlations without the pion softening  @xcite yields a suppression effect also at @xmath37 .",
    "obviously , this effect also follows from general consideration in refs .",
    "@xcite , if one artificially suppresses the pion softening effect .",
    "after the seminal work of a.b .",
    "migdal  @xcite , various aspects of the nucleon superfluidity in neutron stars were studied in the literature : the presence of a nucleon superfluid interacting with the normal component is needed for explanation of glitches in pulsar periods and neutron star quakes  @xcite .",
    "explanation of pulsar cooling curves also requires an inclusion of superfluid phases  @xcite .",
    "several superfluid phases are found possible .",
    "phase transitions between different phases may take place  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly accepted that most important are the superfluid phases with the spin - singlet pairing of neutrons and protons , in the @xmath41 state , and the spin - triplet pairing of neutrons in the @xmath42 states .",
    "the latter is believed to occur in neutron star interior at @xmath37 in the state with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the projection of the total pair momentum onto a quantization axis . in case",
    "@xmath45 the exponential suppression of the specific heat and the neutrino emissivity is replaced by a power - law suppression since the gap vanishes at the poles of the fermi sphere .",
    "this possibility was mentioned for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding reaction rates were calculated in ref .",
    "however , a mechanism to realize this interesting possibility in neutron star cooling was not elaborated yet .",
    "many papers are devoted to the calculation of pairing gaps within different approaches  @xcite .",
    "the obtained results can be essentially different depending on a model for the nucleon - nucleon interaction and a calculation scheme .",
    "the predictions of the neutron @xmath42 gaps are especially uncertain , e.g. , compare refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "for review see ref .",
    "@xcite and references there in . ref .",
    "@xcite argues that @xmath42 gap should be strongly suppressed whereas ref .",
    "@xcite argues for its strong enhancement .",
    "reference  @xcite calculated cooling curves using both these assumptions and concluded that the cooling history is naturally explained within assumption on the suppressed @xmath42 gap .",
    "recently ref .",
    "@xcite studied the new data on the cooling of cas a object .",
    "their conclusion is in favor of a suppressed @xmath42 gap . at temperatures below the critical temperatures of the neutron , @xmath46 , and proton , @xmath47 , pairing , the reaction rates , considered above ,",
    "are suppressed because of a decrease of the available phase space .",
    "initially , the suppression effects were included simply by multiplying the rate of a two - nucleon process by the factors @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "later , the phase - space suppression factors ( so called @xmath49 factors ) have been treated more accurately in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in nucleon superfluids",
    ", there exist new neutrino - production mechanisms , which are forbidden for @xmath50 .",
    "these are the processes , suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the creation of a neutrino  anti - neutrino pair is associated with the breaking and formation of a cooper pair  the so - called nucleon pair breaking and formation ( pbf ) processes .",
    "the emissivities of the nucleon pbf processes are suppressed at @xmath51 by the same factor @xmath52 as for the mu , nb , mmu and mnb processes . however , in comparison to the all latter processes , the nucleon pbf processes have the large one - nucleon phase - space volume  @xcite .",
    "the existence of this new cooling mechanism demonstrates that influence of the nucleon pairing on the neutrino production rates can not be reduced just to an introduction of a simple phase - space suppression factor .",
    "early works  @xcite which studied the pbf processes , did not care about the conservation of the weak vector current .",
    "the latter is fulfilled only if the in - medium renormalization of weak vertex functions is performed in accord with the renormalization of green s functions .",
    "this problem was tackled in refs .",
    "reference  @xcite argued that the emissivity of the @xmath41 pbf processes should be dramatically suppressed as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the fermi velocity of non - relativistic nucleons , provided the vector current conservation constraint is taken into account .",
    "the consistent calculation of the pbf emissivity induced by the vector and axial - vector currents was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the larkin - migdal - leggett fermi - liquid approach .",
    "the latter takes properly into account correlation effects in both particle - particle and particle - hole channels .",
    "it was demonstrated that the neutrino emissivity is actually controlled by the axial - vector current and is suppressed only by the factor @xmath55 , rather than @xmath53 .",
    "both neutron pbf and proton pbf processes yield contributions of the same order of magnitude provided strong and electromagnetic renormalizations of the proton weak vertices @xcite are included . in ref .",
    "@xcite one argues that for the @xmath42 neutron pairing the vector current conservation changes moderately the result obtained without its inclusion . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the suppression of the pbf processes at low densities might be served as a possible explanation of the superburst ignition .    as we have mentioned , the convenient nambu - gorkov formalism developed for the description of metallic superconductors , cf .",
    "@xcite , does not distinguish interactions in particle - particle and particle - hole channels .",
    "these interactions can be , however , essentially different in a strongly interacting system , like in the nuclear matter and in the liquid he@xmath1 .",
    "the adequate methods for fermi liquids with pairing were developed for zero temperature by a.i .",
    "larkin and a.b  migdal in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) and for a finite temperature by a.j .",

    "the problem of calculation of a response function of a fermi system to an external interaction becomes tractable at cost of introduction of a set of landau - migdal parameters for quasi - particle interactions .",
    "parameters can be either evaluated microscopically or extracted from analysis of experimental data , see ref .",
    "the technical difference of the larkin - migdal and leggett approaches is that the former approach works out equations for full in - medium vertices , whereas the latter one calculates directly a response function .",
    "the former approach was aimed at the study of transitions in nuclei , and the latter on the analyzes of collective modes in superfluid fermi liquid .",
    "the principal equivalence of both approaches was emphasized already by a.j .",
    "leggett in refs .",
    "reference @xcite demonstrates how one may use both approaches in calculations of the pbf rates .",
    "reference  @xcite was the first one , in which the most important in - medium effects were incorporated in the numerical code for neutron star cooling . among them",
    "neutron pbf and proton pbf processes were treated as equally important .",
    "the pbf processes ( but with free vertices ) were incorporated also in the `` standard '' cooling scenario @xcite that led the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to the suggestion of the minimal cooling paradigm .",
    "detailed simulations of different medium effects have been done in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the minimal cooling paradigm , the medium modifications of all reaction rates lead to their pronounced density dependence .",
    "for the pbf processes it is mainly due to the dependence of pairing gaps and nucleon - nucleon correlation factors on the density . for mmu processes the reaction matrix elements are strongly density dependent due to the softening of the exchanged pion and the dependence of nucleon - nucleon correlation factors on the density .",
    "it establishes the strong link between the cooling behavior of a neutron star and its mass @xcite .",
    "the density dependence of the reaction rates provides a smooth transition from `` standard '' to `` non - standard '' cooling for the increasing star - center density , i.e. , for increasing the star mass .",
    "thus , the inclusion of the most important in - medium effects within the _ `` nuclear medium cooling scenario '' _ enables us to describe appropriately both high and low surface temperatures obtained from analyzes of soft x - ray pulsar data .",
    "the mentioned above moderate suppression of the pbf emissivity ( @xmath55 ) at @xmath41 pairing should not significantly affect general conclusions on the neutron star cooling history done in previous works where it was not incorporated .",
