    "this appendix is devoted to highlight the tools of homological commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that are needed to justify the validity of algorithms  [ algo : mainalgo ] and  [ algo : hirzebruch ] , and to explain the choice of the support of the syzygies in step 2 which define the matrix representation of the parametrized surface .    given @xmath47 , the toric embedding @xmath367 in section [ ssec : toricemb ] provides a @xmath256-grading in the coordinate ring @xmath368/j_p$ ] in   of @xmath233 , which can be used to study the map @xmath251 in diagram [ diagram2 t ] and its associated rees and symmetric algebras , denoted by @xmath369 and @xmath370 respectively .",
    "notice also that the graded ring @xmath21 coincides with the affine semigroup ring of the lattice polytope @xmath47 , which is _ cohen - macaulay _ and normal because @xmath47 has dimension @xmath26 .",
    "the grading in @xmath21 plays a key role in the elimination process .",
    "the matrix representation @xmath10 of section [ ssec : general ] depends on a choice of degree @xmath89 , as was shown in section [ ss : curves ] for the case of curves .",
    "the reason why @xmath89 needs to be considered is rather technical , and a complete explanation involves sheaf cohomology . from a more naive point of view",
    ", the implicit equation of the surface @xmath371 is written in the variables @xmath372 but depends on the algebraic relations among the polynomials @xmath252 , which lie in @xmath21 . fixing a degree @xmath89 in @xmath21",
    "can be thought as _ eliminating the variables of @xmath21 , by hiding them in the monomial basis of the graded piece @xmath301_. in turn , recall that the variables @xmath373 in @xmath21 code monomials in the original @xmath16 variables , with exponents in the lattice points in @xmath47 .    more geometrically , consider the graph variety @xmath374 of @xmath251 where both group of variables @xmath375 and @xmath114 are involved .",

    "the projection @xmath381 corresponds to eliminating the variables @xmath240 of @xmath369 .",
    "we denote by @xmath382 the defining ideal of @xmath383 .    how to eliminate the @xmath375 variables from @xmath369 algebraically ?",
    "a standard procedure is to find a free graded presentation @xmath384 and a degree @xmath89 ( in the @xmath375 variables ) such that the fitting ideal @xmath385 generated by the maximal minors of @xmath92 ( in the graded strand @xmath386 ) computes @xmath382 .",
    "it happens that no universal way to compute such a free presentation is available , so the idea is to `` approximate '' @xmath369 by the ( hopefully ) similar algebra @xmath370 that admits such a universal resolution .",
    "these resolutions of the symmetric algebras are known as approximation complexes , they were introduced in  @xcite and their application on elimination theory was done in  @xcite .",
    "the last map of the approximation complex is the following in our case : @xmath387{\\stackrel}{m'}{{\\longrightarrow}}a[t_0,t_1,t_2,t_3]\\to { \\mathrm{sym}_a ( i)}\\to 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath388 is the first module of syzygies of @xmath250 and @xmath389^t$ ] , that is , @xmath390 the cokernel of @xmath391 is @xmath392/ j$ ] , where @xmath393\\mbox { and } \\sum a_ig_i=0\\}.\\ ] ] we can recognize the origin of the linear forms @xmath94 in step 2 of our algorithms !",
    "but there is a remaining question : which is the relation between @xmath369 and @xmath370 ?",
    "which variety does @xmath370 define ?",
    "can we use @xmath394 to compute @xmath395 for some @xmath89 ?",
    "the answer is that in case there are finitely many base points and for each base point @xmath14 , the local @xmath282 is a local complete intersection , then @xmath369 and @xmath370 define the same scheme in @xmath396 ( thus , in @xmath397 ) . as @xmath369 is @xmath398-torsion free , both algebras coincide module the @xmath398-torsion of @xmath370 , @xmath399 , where @xmath398 is the maximal ideal generated by @xmath400 . thus if @xmath253 is a local complete intersection and @xmath89 is such that @xmath401 , then @xmath402 .",
    "this happens for @xmath403 by theorem  11 in  @xcite ( in fact , that result also proves theorem  [ th : refinement ] as remarked before ) .",
    "in particular , in this case , @xmath394 computes @xmath395 for any @xmath404 .",
    "in fact , the condition of @xmath253 being a local complete intersection can be relaxed to the condition of being locally an almost complete intersection .",
    "( i.e.  @xmath282 can be generated by @xmath173 elements , for any @xmath14 in the finite set @xmath405 ) . in this case , @xmath406 . since there is always a surjective map @xmath407 then @xmath408 , where @xmath210 has the same dimension .",
    "in particular , @xmath409 .",
    "for @xmath404 , @xmath370 is @xmath398-torsion free , and @xmath394 computes @xmath410 for any @xmath404 .",
    "so , the gcd @xmath411 of the maximal minors of @xmath412 contains has the homogenization of the implicit equation @xmath8 as a factor .    in the bigraded case of hirzebruch surfaces , in particular in the standard bigraded case , the basic ideas are similar , but",
    "new technical details have to be managed in order to determine the bidegrees for which the torsion of the symmetric algebra vanishes .",
