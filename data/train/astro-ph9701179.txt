    "the rosat brightest cluster sample ( bcs , ebeling et al . 1996b , hereafter paper i ) is a 90% complete , flux limited sample of the 199 x - ray brightest clusters of galaxies in the northern hemisphere ( @xmath3 ) , at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath4 , with redshifts @xmath5 , fluxes higher than @xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 and luminosities higher than @xmath9 erg s@xmath8 in the 0.12.4 kev band .",
    "second in size only to the xbacs sample of ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , the bcs is one of the largest statistical cluster samples compiled at x - ray wavelengths to date .",
    "it is the only large - scale sample available today that is not only x - ray _ flux limited _ but also x - ray _ selected _ in the sense that the bcs , unlike the xbacs , is not limited to systems initially found in optical surveys but contains clusters selected by their x - ray properties only .",
    "the bcs thus represents an ideal sample for studies of the formation , distribution and evolution of structure on the largest metric and mass scales . providing important constraints on the cosmological parameters governing cluster evolution , the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of clusters of galaxies represents a particularly vital statistic in this context .",
    "several previous studies based on much smaller samples of typically 50 clusters found the evolution in the cluster x - ray luminosity function to be ` negative ' in the sense that x - ray luminous clusters are more numerous now than they were in the past ( edge et al .",
    "1990 ; gioia et al .",
    "1990 ; henry et al .  1992 ; david et al .",
    "they were , however , not only in conflict with other studies , which found no evidence for cluster evolution ( e.g. , kowalski et al .",
    "1984 ) , but also somewhat inconsistent among themselves .",
    "the strong evolution seen by edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) in their sample of 46 x - ray bright clusters at high galactic latitude and @xmath10 is not present in the first two redshift bins ( 44 clusters at @xmath11 ) of the sample of gioia et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) who find significant evolution only at @xmath12 .",
    "more recently , two studies found no sign of evolution at all in the xlf of samples of abell and aco clusters at @xmath13 ( briel & henry 1993 ) and @xmath14 ( burg et al .",
    "1994 ) , respectively . however , these samples were neither x - ray selected nor x - ray flux limited and may thus not be fair representations of the cluster population in general . at considerably higher redshifts ( @xmath15 ) on the other hand , studies based on yet smaller samples observed in deep x - ray pointings ( bower et al .  1994 ;",
    "castander et al .  1994 ; castander et al .",
    "1995 ) suggest a significant drop in the cluster space density as compared to the value observed locally .",
    "although the overall evidence is thus in favor of negative evolution of the cluster xlf at least for x - ray luminous clusters at redshifts well in excess of 0.3 , the overall picture is anything but clear . with the completion of the bcs we are now able to provide a definitive answer to the question of whether cluster evolution is significant at low to intermediate redshifts and , in any case ,",
    "provide an accurate determination of the local cluster xlf as a much - needed reference for ongoing and future evolutionary studies at higher redshifts .",
    "the implications of our findings for cosmological models of cluster evolution will be addressed in a forthcoming paper ( ebeling et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we assume @xmath16 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 and @xmath17 throughout this paper .",
    "the bcs as published in paper i is only 90% complete and corrections for incompleteness need to be applied to account for clusters missing from the sample . in doing this",
    "we use a selection function based on the @xmath18 distribution of the serendipitous detections in our sample ( see  7.1 of paper i ) .",
    "we use the usual definition of the unbinned , differential xlf for a sample with flux limit @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the space density of clusters with x - ray fluxes above the flux limit and x - ray luminosities within an interval @xmath22 around @xmath23 .",
    "since we use an unbinned representation , @xmath24 is given for each cluster by @xmath25 , i.e. , the inverse search volume defined by the luminosity distance at which the x - ray flux from a cluster with intrinsic luminosity @xmath23 would equal the flux limit of the sample .",
    "the systems x - ray temperatures as listed in paper i are used in the computation of k corrections .",
    "we use a schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) of the form @xmath26 to model the xlf and determine @xmath27 , @xmath0 and @xmath28 in a maximum - likelihood fit to the unbinned data .",
    "table  [ partab ] gives an overview of the fit results obtained in all five standard energy bands currently in use within the scientific community : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 kev , as well as the pseudo - bolometric band from 0.01 to 100 kev .",
    "we discuss the results in detail in the following paragraphs .",
    "figure  [ xlf0.1 - 2.4 ] shows the differential xlf for the bcs in the generic @xmath29 kev band of the rosat observatory .",
    "we test the robustness of the fit by comparing it to the xlf obtained for the larger , 80% complete bcs ( unpublished , cf .",
    "paper i ) and find excellent agreement . also shown in figure",
    "[ xlf0.1 - 2.4 ] are the xlf data points for the high - galactic - latitude sample of edge et al .",
    "( 1990 , hereafter b50 ) ( open diamonds ) which is x - ray flux limited in the @xmath32 kev band .",
    "since all 46 b50 clusters have measured x - ray temperatures , the conversion of their luminosities to the @xmath29 kev band of the bcs is less inaccurate than the opposite operation , i.e. , the conversion of the bcs luminosities into the @xmath32 kev band , which relies heavily on temperature estimates rather than measured values . to assess the impact of band conversion effects we make the comparison between the xlfs of the b50 and the bcs in either band . in the @xmath29 kev band",
    "we find the xlf for the b50 to be , in general , in good agreement with the bcs xlf . at low x - ray luminosities , however , the best schechter function fit for the b50 ( the dotted line in figure  [ xlf0.1 - 2.4 ] and obtained with the same ml algorithm used throughout for the fitting of the bcs xlfs ) severely underpredicts the observed volume density of clusters , indicating incompleteness of the b50 at @xmath33 erg s@xmath8 ( @xmath29 kev ) .",
    "this is , however , not surprising given that the b50 is , by design , only flux - limited in the @xmath32 kev band .",
    "figure  [ xlf0.5 - 2.0 ] shows the bcs xlf in the rosat hard band covering the energy range from 0.5 to 2.0 kev .",
    "note that , like for all other energy bands discussed in the following , the conversion from the original bcs band ( @xmath34 kev ) to the rosat hard band was performed for each cluster individually using the x - ray temperatures and galactic column densities given in table  2 of paper i and assuming a metallicity of 0.3 of the solar value . also shown in figure  [ xlf0.5 - 2.0 ] are the data of the xlf of groups and poor clusters of galaxies as presented by burns et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter bll ) and their best power - law xlf .",
    "note the good agreement between the two samples as well as the respective xlf models in the overlap region between @xmath35 erg s@xmath8 ( the lowest luminosity of any bcs cluster ) and @xmath36 erg s@xmath8 ( the highest luminosity of bll s poor cluster sample ) . finally , we overlay in fig .",
    "[ xlf0.5 - 2.0 ] the best fitting schechter function xlf determined by de grandi ( 1996 ) for the 111 clusters of the bsgc - kp sample , a subset of a larger rosat cluster sample under compilation in the southern hemisphere ( guzzo et al .",
    "1995 ) . for luminosities in excess of @xmath37 erg s@xmath8",
    "de grandi s xlf is in very good agreement with the best - fitting bcs schechter function . below this value",
    "the bsgc - kp xlf falls increasingly below both the bll and the bcs fits , reaching a deviation of a factor of 2 and 3 , respectively , at the lower end of the bsgc - kp luminosity range .",
    "the reference in the @xmath31 kev band is the emss cluster sample of henry et al .",
    "figure  [ xlf0.3 - 3.5 ] shows the bcs xlf in the @xmath31 kev band with the emss data points from the first two redshift shells ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) overlaid as shaded diamonds .",
    "( we remind the reader that the power law descriptions of the emss xlf found by henry and coworkers in these shells are consistent with one another within the errors , so that the comparison with the whole of the bcs made in figure  [ xlf0.3 - 3.5 ] is legitimate . )",
    "note the very good agreement between the emss and bcs luminosity functions , but also the much higher accuracy provided by the bcs .",
    "also shown in figure  [ xlf0.3 - 3.5 ] is the xlf from the third emss redshift shell ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "contrary to our findings for the emss xlf for clusters at @xmath41 , the emss xlf of these high - redshift systems differs noticeably from the bcs xlf as the local reference .",
    "a detailed re - assessment of the significance of the evolution implied by this discrepancy is presented by ebeling et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    although , in table  [ partab ] , we do list the results of a schechter function fit to the bcs data in the @xmath32 kev band , the bcs xlf in this hard energy band should be regarded with caution .",
    "the @xmath32 kev band has hardly any overlap with the @xmath29 kev bcs detection band , which renders a flux conversion that is largely based on estimated temperatures a dangerous enterprise . keeping this caveat in mind we nonetheless find the power law description from piccinotti et al.(1982 ) to be in good agreement with the bcs xlf irrespective of whether the virgo cluster is included or not ( figure  [ xlf2 - 10 ] ) .    the best fit parameters from the schechter function fit to the b50 data published by edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , on the other hand , provide an unacceptable fit to the bcs xlf at luminosities in excess of about @xmath42 erg s@xmath8 , where the fit given by edge et al.falls significantly below the bcs data .",
    "this failure of the original b50 schechter function fit to describe the bcs xlf is due to an error in the volume calculation in the work of edge and coworkers .",
    "fitting the b50 data with our maximum likelihood algorithm we find @xmath43 mpc@xmath44 erg s@xmath45 , @xmath46 erg s@xmath8 , and @xmath47 , in good agreement with the results for the bcs ( see figure  [ xlf2 - 10 ] and table  [ partab ] ) .",
    "we search for evidence of evolution by splitting the bcs at a redshift @xmath48 and independently fitting schechter functions to the data in the two redshift shells thus created .",
    "care has to be taken not to navely misinterpret every statistically significant difference between the best fit parameters in the two shells as signature of evolution . in order to avoid effects due to large scale structure",
    ", we vary @xmath48 from 0.05 to 0.2 and look for trends that are robust over a range of @xmath48 values . since , due to the flux - limited nature of our sample , the low - luminosity end of the xlf , and thus @xmath28 , is ill - constrained for the high - redshift subsample once @xmath48 exceeds @xmath49 , we fix the power law slope @xmath28 at its overall best - fit value of 1.85 in the maximum - likelihood fits to the data of either subsample . with",
    "@xmath28 frozen we are thus left with two free parameters , the normalization @xmath27 and the characteristic luminosity @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ evol1 ] shows the contours of the c statistic ( which is @xmath50 distributed ) of @xmath27 and @xmath0 for some of these low - redshift and high - redshift subsamples of the bcs as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "while differences found at @xmath51 can be attributed entirely to large - scale structure , a significant decrease in @xmath27 or @xmath0 at higher values of @xmath48 would be indicative of negative evolution .",
    "as , for @xmath52 , the 68% confidence contours of the low - redshift and high - redshift subsamples overlap , we conclude that there is no significant evolution in either the amplitude @xmath27 of the cluster xlf or the characteristic luminosity @xmath0 for values of @xmath53 up to 0.2 .",
    "since , in the high - redshift subsamples with @xmath54 , @xmath27 becomes ill - constrained and increasingly strongly correlated with @xmath0 , we also tested for evolution only in @xmath0 by holding @xmath27 constant at its overall best - fit value of @xmath55 mpc@xmath44 erg s@xmath45 , a value well within the 68% confidence contours of all fits shown in fig .",
    "[ evol1 ] .",
    "we find the variations in @xmath0 to be smaller than 30(37)% for @xmath56 which is less than @xmath57 significant , confirming the no - evolution result of fig .",
    "[ evol1 ] .    as an independent check",
    ", we also looked for variations in @xmath58 as a function of both @xmath59 and @xmath23  and found none .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test finds the distribution of @xmath60 values ( whose median is 0.47 ) to be consistent with uniformity at the greater than 74% confidence level suggesting again that the cluster space density of the bcs is homogeneous out to the limiting redshift of @xmath61 .",
    "using the rosat brightest cluster sample ( bcs ) as presented by ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996b ) we have established the local x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of clusters of galaxies within @xmath61 with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "we find the xlf to be well described by a schechter function whose free parameters @xmath27 , @xmath0 , and @xmath28 we determine in a maximum - likelihood fit for all x - ray energy bands currently used within the community .",
    "comparing our results with previous measurements of the cluster xlf we find very good agreement with the work of piccinotti et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , henry et al .  (",
    "1992 ) , and burns et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , as well as with the xlf for the b50 sample of edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) when the same maximum likelihood algorithm is used to determine the best schechter function fit .",
    "we find no significant variations in the amplitude or the characteristic luminosity of the best - fitting schechter function as a function of redshift .",
    "also , the distribution of @xmath60 values is consistent at the 74% confidence level with a non - evolving space density of clusters out to @xmath61 .",
    "our findings do thus not confirm the claim of strong evolution at @xmath2 made by edge and coworkers but support the notion of ebeling et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that the apparent signature of evolution in the b50 sample is due to a combination of its high x - ray flux limit in the @xmath32 kev band and a pronounced , if statistically insignificant , dearth of very x - ray luminous clusters around a redshift of about 0.15 .",
