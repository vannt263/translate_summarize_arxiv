    "spiral galaxies are accompanied by satellites that have a range of structural characteristics .",
    "the brightest companions of some spiral galaxies tend to be disks , while in other cases the brightest companions are spheroids .",
    "this diversity in companion properties is clearly evident among the closest large spiral galaxies .",
    "the brightest satellites of the milky - way are the disk - dominated lmc and smc , both of which show moderate levels of star formation at the present day . for comparison ,",
    "the brightest companions of the next nearest large spiral galaxy , m31 , tend to be gas - poor spheroids , including the compact elliptical galaxy m32 and the dwarf ellipticals ( des ) ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 .",
    "the next closest large spiral galaxy - m81 - is accompanied by a mixture of disk and spheroid galaxies that have a broad range of star - forming properties , some of which are experiencing elevated levels of star formation due to tidal interactions ( e.g. yun , ho , & lo 1994 ) . despite the differences among the most easily studied high surface brightness satellites , m81 , m31 , and the milky - way are all accompanied by an entourage of dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies that show broadly similar characteristics ( karachentev et al . 2001 ) .",
    "initial conditions , such as the fractional dark matter content , could affect morphology ( e.g. ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ; carraro et al .",
    "2001 ) , and so are a possible cause of the range in structural properties seen among the satellite systems .",
    "studies of de s in the virgo cluster ( geha , guhathakurta , & van der marel 2002 ) and the local group ( e.g. held et al .",
    "1992 ) find m / l ratios that are suggestive of no significant dark matter contribution , at least within the visible portions of these systems . for comparison ,",
    "local group dsphs appear to have high m / l ratios that are suggestive of a large dark matter halo ( e.g. irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ; kleyna et al .",
    "2002 ) . as for dwarf",
    "irregular galaxies , cote , carignan , & freeman ( 2000 ) find that the m / l ratios of these objects in the sculptor and centaurus groups span a range of values , implying a dispersion in dark matter contents .",
    "environment can also influence morphology ; for example , it has been suggested that galaxy - galaxy encounters in dense environments and tidal interactions with larger systems may transform disk systems into spheroids ( e.g. moore , lake , & katz 1998 ; mayer et al .",
    "2001 ) . in extreme cases tidal interactions",
    "will completely disrupt some satellites , with only the dense central regions surviving to the present day and the stars that once belonged to the disrupted system being distributed along debris trails ( e.g. bekki & chiba 2004 ; mizutani , chiba , & sakamoto 2003 ; bekki & freeman 2003 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that m32 may have evolved in such as manner , starting as a disk galaxy that was transformed by interactions with m31 ; graham ( 2002 ) argues that signatures of the disk remain to the present day .",
    "the stellar contents of satellites provide a fossil record that can be mined to reveal their histories and gauge the impact that any interactions with larger companions have had on their evolution .",
    "ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 are important targets as they are similar to more distant de galaxies ( e.g. zinnecker & cannon 1986 ) , and have a wide range of projected distances from m31 , raising the possiblity that the effects of environment might be de - coupled from any intrinsic properties of the galaxies .",
    "for example , a correlation between the number of stars that formed during the past few gyr and distance from m31 might indicate that interactions with m31 played a key role in spurring star formation in these galaxies , and might even have provided the gas and dust necessary to stoke star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "a discovery of similar star forming histories , despite the differences in environment , would favour the notion that the evolution of these galaxies is dominated by intrinsic properties .",
    "given their importance as the nearest des , it is not surprising that the three m31 de companions have been the target of a number of investigations .",
    "ngc 147 has been found to contain a modest population of relatively bright agb stars , that are the brightest members of a population that accounts for only a small fraction of the total @xmath6band light ( davidge 1994 ) .",
    "the absence of main sequence turn - off stars with m@xmath7 indicates that the most recent large scale star - forming activity occured at least 1 gyr in the past ( han et al .",
    "ngc 147 contains c stars ( e.g. nowotny et al",
    "battinelli & demers ( 2004a ) find that the c stars are uniformly mixed throughout the main body of the galaxy , and may be slightly fainter on average in the @xmath8band than their counterparts in other local group galaxies .",
    "there is a large population of older stars , and the color of the rgb indicates that [ fe / h ] is between 0.9 and 1.2 , with a dispersion about the mean value and possible radial gradients in both metallicity and age ( mould , kristian , & da costa 1983 ; davidge 1994 ; han et al .",
    "a spread in metallicity indicates that ngc 147 has experienced chemical enrichment .",
    "nevertheless , hi has yet to be detected in ngc 147 ( young & lo 1997 ) , and the upper limit computed for the ism mass is markedly lower than is expected if material ejected from evolved stars has been retained by the galaxy , suggesting that the ism has been depleted ( sage , welch , & mitchell 1998 ) .",
    "ngc 185 contains stars that span a broader range of ages than in ngc 147 ( lee , freedman , & madore 1993 ; martinez - delgado & aparicio 1998 ; martinez - delgado , aparicio , & gallart 1999 ) .",
    "the youngest stars have an age near 400 myr ( butler & martinez - delgado 2005 ) and are concentrated in the central @xmath9 parsec@xmath10 ; outside of this area there are stars with ages of at least 1 gyr , which in turn are more centrally concentrated than even older populations ( martinez - delgado et al .",
    "kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) surveyed the agb content of the central regions of ngc 185 at near - infrared wavelengths , and found 73 c stars .",
    "the mean m@xmath11 of c stars in ngc 185 is comparable to that in ngc 147 , although the c stars in ngc 185 are more centrally concentrated than in ngc 147 ( battinelli & demers 2004b ; nowotny et al .",
    "the mean metallicity of the rgb is [ fe / h ] = 1.2 , with a dispersion of @xmath12 dex ( lee et al .",
    "the ism in ngc 185 is concentrated near the present - day star - forming region , although the atomic and molecular components are not spatially coincident ( welch , mitchell , & yi 1996 ; young 2001 ) .",
    "the morphology and kinematic properties of the ism are consistent with it originating from stars internal to ngc 185 ( young & lo 1997 ; martinez - delgado et al . 1999 ) .",
    "ngc 205 is the brightest of the three de companions of m31 .",
    "there is a centrally concentrated population of young blue stars that have ages in the range @xmath13 myr ( cappellari et al .",
    "1999 ) , and a solar metallicity agb component that is uniformly mixed throughout the central 1 arcmin ( davidge 1992 ) . lee ( 1996 ) concludes that the agb - tip in ngc 205 is @xmath14 mag brighter in @xmath15 than in ngc 185 , and that the agb luminosity functions ( lfs ) of these galaxies also differ , in the sense that the lf of ngc 205 is the flatter of the two .",
    "however , the c stars in ngc 205 have an average m@xmath11 that is similar to what is seen in ngc 147 and ngc 185 ( demers , battinelli , & letarte 2003 ) .",
    "the color of the rgb suggests that [ fe / h ] = 0.9 with a dispersion of @xmath16 dex ( mould , kristian , & da costa 1984 ) . as with ngc 147 ,",
    "the total ism mass of ngc 205 is less than expected if the mass lost from stars has been retained ( welch , sage , & mitchell 1998 ) .",
    "ngc 205 is the closest de to m31 ; hence , it might be anticipated that m31 has had a greater impact on the evolution of ngc 205 than on the evolution of either ngc 147 or ngc 185 .",
    "in fact , the orbits of ngc 205 , m32 , and m31 indicate that there may have been past interactions ( cepa & beckman 1988 ) , and there are a number of other clues that support this notion .",
    "first , the star - forming history of ngc 205 inferred from agb stars is correlated with the orbit about m31 , in that the agb content shows evidence for multiple episodes of star formation during the past gyr , with the most recent occuring within the past 0.1 gyr ( davidge 2003 ) .",
    "second , the gas and stars in ngc 205 form distinct dynamical systems ( young & lo 1997 ; welch et al . 1998 ) , as might be expected if the molecular clouds have been tidally affected by interactions with m31 . third , the isophotal properties of ngc 205 and the presence of stellar debris trails in the vicinity of m31 are indicative of interactions ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "2001 , choi , guhathakurta , & johnston 2002 , and mcconnachie et al .",
    "finally , there is an hi cloud 25 arcmin southwest of ngc 205 that may contain material that has been stripped from the galaxy ( thilker et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the majority of stellar content studies of ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 have used data that sample the visible and red portions of the spectrum .",
    "this wavelength region is of critical importance for probing young , blue stars and the hotter red giants that belong to moderately young and very metal - poor old populations .",
    "however , the visible portion of the spectrum is not ideal for studies of the reddest stars , such as those evolving near the agb - tip , as the brightnesses of these objects at visible wavelengths are affected by line blanketing .",
    "this causes the agb to form a horizontal or even descending sequence on cmds constructed from visible wavelength data , thereby complicating efforts to detect stars near the agb - tip .",
    "not only does the observed brightness of agb - tip stars at visible wavelengths not reflect the true luminosity of these objects , but the contrast between agb - tip stars and bluer objects is diminished , such that agb - tip stars may occur in a brightness regime where confusion with more numerous objects , such as rgb stars , becomes an issue .",
    "the problems caused by line blanketing are much reduced in the near - infrared , where the agb forms a near - vertical sequence on cmds ( e.g. davidge 2003 ) .",
    "the contrast with respect to bluer stars is enhanced , and the brightness of the agb - tip is easier to measure than at visible wavelengths . finally , c stars can also be selected using broad - band near - infrared colors ( davidge 2003 , hughes & wood 1990 ) .",
    "near - infrared color is a criterion that differs from the narrow - band filter technique that is traditionally used to identify c stars in the red part of the spectrum ( e.g. richer , crabtree , & pritchet 1984 ) , and so a comparison of c star properties based on near - infrared color and narrow - band imaging is of interest .    in the present study ,",
    "@xmath17 images are used to investigate the bright agb contents of ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 .",
    "the data were obtained during the same night and with the same instrument , and thus are well - suited for comparing the relative stellar contents of these systems .",
    "the core data for ngc 185 and ngc 205 are supplemented with @xmath4band observations obtained with the same instrument during a previous observing run , which are used to investigate the frequency and amplitude distribution of variable stars .",
    "the distances and reddenings adopted in this study are listed in table 1 .",

    "details of the observations and the procedures used to process the data are presented in  2 , while the photometric measurements are discussed in  3 .",

    "the properties of lpvs in ngc 185 and ngc 205 are examined in  6 .",
    "a discussion and summary of the results follows in  7 .",
    "near - infrared images of the central regions of ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 were recorded with the cfhtir imager on the night of ut november 21/22 2002 .",
    "the cfhtir detector is a @xmath19 hgcdte array , with an image scale of 0.21 arcsec pixel@xmath20 when mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 3.6 metre canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "the data were recorded through @xmath21 and @xmath22 filters as a series of relatively short ( 20  60 sec ) exposures to prevent saturating the background sky and the brightest stars in each field .",
    "the total integration time is 12 minutes filter@xmath20 galaxy@xmath20 .",
    "a separate set of @xmath22 observations were recorded of ngc 185 and ngc 205 with the cfhtir during an observing run in june 2001 , and these data are used in  6 to investigate the variability of bright agb stars in these galaxies .",
    "the ngc 205 observations were discussed previously by davidge ( 2003 ) , and a complete description of those data can be found in that paper .",
    "the ngc 185 data were recorded on the night of ut june 5/6 2001 .",
    "the total integration time is 8 minutes , and thin clouds were present when the data were recorded .",
    "data needed to construct calibration frames that can correct for artifacts introduced by the telescope , the instrument , and the sky were recorded on each night of the 2001 and 2002 observing runs .",
    "flat field images of the dome were obtained at the beginning of each night , while the dark current was monitored at the end of each night . the flat - field pattern and dark count rate did not vary during each run , and so the nightly calibration exposures were combined to create master flat - field and dark frames .",
    "areas of the sky with low stellar density were also observed at various times throughout each night , and these data were used to construct calibration images that monitor interference fringe patterns and the thermal emission from warm objects along the optical path .",
    "the data were reduced using a standard pipeline for near - infrared images .",
    "the basic steps in the processing sequence are : ( 1 ) the subtraction of a dark frame , ( 2 ) the division by a flat - field frame , ( 3 ) the subtraction of the dc sky level from each image , and ( 4 ) the subtraction of the appropriate interference fringe @xmath23 thermal emission calibration frame . the processed images for each field @xmath23 filter combination were aligned to correct for offsets introduced during acquisition , and then median combined .",
    "the final step was to remove those portions of the combined images that do not have the full exposure time .",
    "the final @xmath24 images of the galaxies are shown in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "single stars in the final images have fwhms in the range 0.7  0.9 arcsec , depending on the galaxy .",
    "stellar brightnesses were measured with the point spread function ( psf ) fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) . the co - ordinates , preliminary brightnesses , and psfs that are used by allstar were obtained from routines in the daophot ( stetson 1987 ) photometry package .",
    "the psfs for each image were constructed from at least 40 stars .",
    "standard stars from hawarden et al .",
    "( 2001 ) were observed during both the june 2001 and november 2002 runs , and these were used to define the photometric calibration .",
    "the consistency of the calibration was checked by comparing the brightnesses of stars with @xmath25 with measurements in the 2mass point source catalogue ( cutri et al .",
    "sources within 1 arcmin of the centers of ngc 185 and ngc 205 were avoided when making these comparisons .",
    "the mean differences , in the sense cfhtir ",
    "2mass are @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where the quoted uncertainties are the standard deviations about the mean .",
    "the standard deviation is an upper limit to the actual dispersion due to photometric errors as some of the stars used in this comparison may be photometric variables .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the photometric calibration is reliable to within a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "artificial star experiments were run to investigate sample completeness and the random uncertainties in the photometry due to crowding and photon noise .",
    "both the degree of completeness and the errors in the photometry depend on the projected stellar density , in the sense that incompleteness sets in at progressively brighter levels , while the uncertainties in the photometry at a given magnitude become larger , as stellar density increases . to account for these effects in a basic way ,",
    "the field imaged for each galaxy was divided into two equal area regions centered on the galaxy nucleus ; the photometric properties of stars in the area that includes the center of each galaxy ( the ` inner ' region ) are considered separately from those that are outside of this area ( the ` outer ' region ) .",
    "this division also permits gradients in stellar content to be investigated (  5 ) .",
    "the artificial stars were assigned colors that are representative of bright m giants and c stars , and were added in 0.5 magnitude increments in @xmath28 .",
    "based on the cmds that are discussed in  4 , m giants were assumed to have @xmath29 and @xmath30 while c stars were assumed to have @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "a total of sixty artificial stars of each type , evenly split between the inner and outer regions , were added to the images of each galaxy at each @xmath28 magnitude .",
    "the standard deviations in the differences between the measured and actual values of @xmath28 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for stars with @xmath35 , which is a brightness at which both m giants and c stars are seen in all three galaxies , are listed in tables 2 ( m giants ) and 3 ( c stars ) .",
    "the entries in tables 2 and 3 indicate that the photometric errors predicted for the inner and outer regions of all three galaxies differ by only modest amounts",
    ". moreover , the uncertainties in the ngc 205 measurements are larger than those for either ngc 147 and ngc 185 , due to the higher stellar density in this galaxy .",
    "this complicates efforts to identify lpvs in ngc 205 (  6 ) .    the relative uncertainties in brightnesses and colors in tables 2 and 3 warrant discussion .",
    "the uncertainties in the colors of m giants in table 2 are smaller than the uncertainties in the @xmath28 brightnesses .",
    "this is because the factors that affect brightness measurements , such as crowding , are to some extent panchromatic , and so at least partly cancel out when colors are computed .",
    "indeed , the results in table 2 illustrate why artificial star experiments should be run with stars having realistic colors ; it is not correct to compute the uncertainties in colors simply by adding the uncertainties in the brightness measurements in quadrature , as systematic effects are not considered .",
    "the situation appears to be different in table 3 , where the uncertainties in the colors of c stars tend to be larger than those in the @xmath28 measurements .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the colors of c stars are larger than the uncertainties in the colors of m giants because the former have redder colors , which makes them fainter in @xmath36 and @xmath24 at a given @xmath28 . as a result ,",
    "the uncertainties in the @xmath24 and @xmath36 measurements are larger than those in @xmath28 , and so play a larger role in determining the uncertainties in the colors .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainties in the colors are still smaller than what would be computed simply by adding the uncertainties in the individual brightnesses in quadrature .",
    "the artificial star experiments can also be used to assess the effects of blending , in which two or more stars fall within the same angular resolution element , and so appear as a single object .",
    "given that the cfhtir data sample the crowded central regions of these galaxies then all stars are likely blends , although in the vast majority of cases the bright stars that are the topic of this paper are blended with an object that is much fainter , so that the photometric measurements are essentially those of the brighter star .",
    "however , in the rare event that two agb stars with comparable brightness fall in the same resolution element then the result will appear as a single source that is 2.5 log(2 ) @xmath37 magnitude brighter than the progenitors .    the histogram distribution of the difference between the actual and recovered @xmath4band brightnesses of artificial stars representing m giants with @xmath35 , @xmath38 , is shown in figure 4 for each galaxy .",
    "obvious blends have positive values of @xmath38 , and so skew the distributions if they occur in large numbers .",
    "it is evident from figure 4 that the @xmath38 distributions in the outer regions are symmetric about @xmath39 with no significant tail to positive values , suggesting that blending does not have a major impact on the photometric properties of stars with @xmath35 in these areas of the galaxies .",
    "while there are a handful of stars with @xmath40 in the inner regions , these account for only a modest fraction of the total number of objects , and the main body of data is still centered near @xmath41k @xmath42 .",
    "the results shown in figure 4 indicate that blending does not have a major impact on the photometric properties of stars with @xmath35 in these galaxies .",
    "the effects of blending will be even smaller when @xmath43 , but greater when @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 cmds of the galaxies are shown in figures 5 , 6 , and 7 .",
    "the dominant feature in these cmds is a plume that contains luminous oxygen - rich m giants that are evolving on the agb .",
    "the agb plume is almost vertical in the @xmath45 cmds , and the sequence in the ngc 205 @xmath45 cmd is clearly broader than in the other galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the artificial star experiments , which predict larger uncertainties in the photometric measurements of stars in ngc 205 at a given brightness (  3 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cmds show more structure than the @xmath45 cmds , in the sense that the agb broadens at the bright end , with a spray of stars extending to red colors .",
    "the spray of bright objects to the right of the m giant sequence in the cmds is due to c stars . in order to isolate a clean sample of c",
    "stars it is necessary to determine the color at which c stars dominate over m giants .",
    "hughes & wood ( 1991 ) investigated the near - infrared photometric properties of lpvs in the lmc , and concluded that stars with @xmath46 and @xmath47 are c stars .",
    "however , the majority of objects in the hughes & wood ( 1990 ) study have @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the number of objects with @xmath50 is modest .",
    "in fact , significant numbers of spectrographically confirmed c stars in the lmc and smc have @xmath34 colors as small as 0.6 ( e.g. demers , dallaire , & battinelli 2002 ) . while the identification of such warm c stars from broad - band photometric data alone is problematic , demers et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that the majority of c stars identified from narrow - band imaging and red broad - band photometry have @xmath51 , and advocate this as a criterion for near - infrared c star surveys .",
    "this color criterion is supported by other studies .",
    "nikolaev & weinberg ( 2000 ) identify a tongue of objects with @xmath51 that departs from the m giant sequence on the @xmath1 cmd of the lmc that is associated with c stars .",
    "cioni & habing ( 2005 ) identify a similar feature in the @xmath1 cmd of ngc 6822 , which is also associated with a plateau in the @xmath34 color distribution when @xmath51 .",
    "based on these results , it is assumed in the present study that stars with @xmath52 are c stars .",
    "the near - infrared two - color diagram for lmc lpvs constructed by hughes & wood ( 1990 ) indicates that this corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "a brightness limit for c stars can also be set .",
    "the c star features seen in the @xmath1 cmds of the lmc ( nikolaev & weinberg 2000 ) and ngc 6822 ( cioni & habing 2005 ) have m@xmath54 .",
    "consequently , m@xmath55 is adopted as the faint limit for c stars in the present study .",
    "the color and brightness boundaries for identifying c stars are marked in figures 6 and 7 .",
    "the color boundary tracks the red edge of the m giant sequence in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cmds , while a number of c stars are seen to the right of this boundary .",
    "it is worth noting that a c star sequence can be seen in the @xmath45 cmds , although the c star sequence plunges rapidly downward towards red colors , and so is not as distinct as the c star sequences in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cmds .",
    "it is because the c star and m giant sequences are clearly separated on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cmds that these cmds were adopted as the basis for the detailed analysis of agb properties in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the brightest stars in each cmd belong to the foreground disk , and these form a loose sequence with relatively blue colors . ngc 147 and ngc 185 are viewed at lower galactic latitudes than ngc 205 , and so it is not surprising that the cmds of these galaxies contain a larger number of foreground stars than in ngc 205 . in any event , contamination from foreground stars is likely not a major issue when investigating the bright agb population of these galaxies .",
    "indeed , the foreground star sequence tends to be bluer than the brightest m giants in all three galaxies , although there is some overlap , and the foreground and agb sequences only merge near the faint end of the cmds , where the errors in the photometry are large . as for the region of the cmds containing c stars",
    ", there appears to be no obvious contamination from foreground stars .",
    "while the number of foreground stars is modest , they may still skew efforts to study the brightest portions of the agb . to assess the peak brightness of objects free of foreground star contamination ,",
    "the @xmath28 lfs of m giants , computed from the @xmath0 cmds and assuming that m giants have @xmath56 , were computed , and the results are compared in figure 8 .",
    "the lfs were corrected statistically for foreground star contamination by combining the number counts of objects with @xmath57 in the ngc 147 and ngc 185 fields , where the number of foreground stars is greatest , and then fitting a power - law to the counts as a function of @xmath4magnitude .",
    "the power - law fit was then used to compute the number of foreground stars in each lf magnitude interval . a corresponding relation for ngc 205",
    "was obtained by scaling the relation derived for ngc 147 and ngc 185 to match the number of bright foreground stars in ngc 205 .",
    "the lfs in figure 8 have been normalized according to the number of stars with @xmath28 between 16.9 and 17.5 to facilitate galaxy - to - galaxy the comparisons .",
    "the lfs of m giants in ngc 185 and ngc 205 climb smoothly towards fainter @xmath4magnitudes , with no obvious discontinuities .",
    "while the lfs of the outer regions of all three galaxies are in rough agreement , the inner regions of ngc 185 and ngc 205 clearly contain an excess number of stars with @xmath43 when compared with ngc 147 , and this is due to differences in the peak agb brightness .",
    "to quantify these differences , the peak brightness at which the number counts , corrected for foreground star contamination , differ from zero at the @xmath58 or higher level were computed , and the results are listed in the third column of table 4 .",
    "important caveats are that the most evolved agb stars ( 1 ) are undergoing rapid evolution , and so are relatively short - lived , and ( 2 ) can be photometric variables .",
    "rapid evolution may cause the measured peak brightness to be underestimated , while there is a bias to identifying stars that are near the peak of their light curves as the brightest m giants , and this will act to overestimate the peak brightness . in addition , the peak brightnesses listed in table 4 are for m giants , and in most regions there are brighter c stars ; consequently , the measurements in table 4 are not agb - tip brightnesses .",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath60 cmds of the three galaxies , which form the basis for the subsequent analysis , are compared in figures 9 and 10 .",

    "however , it is apparent from the lower panel of figure 17 that there is good agreement between the outer region lfs .",
    "the comparison in the lower panel of figure 17 indicates that the specific frequency of c stars with a given m@xmath83 in the outer regions of these galaxies is remarkably similar , suggesting that these galaxies have evidently converted similar quantities of gas per unit integrated galaxy mass into stars during intermediate epochs .",
    "the c star contents of these galaxies have also been compared using two statistics that use the integrated brightnesses of c stars .",
    "the first statistic relies on the fact that whereas luminous m giants are an ubiquitous signature of agb evolution over a wide range of ages , the peak production of c stars is delayed until systems have ages near @xmath84 gyr ( e.g. maraston 1998 ) .",
    "consequently , the ratio of light from c stars to that from bright m giants is a measure of the relative star forming histories during intermediate ( @xmath85 gyr ) and moderately recent ( @xmath86 gyr ) epochs .",
    "the ratio of the total @xmath4band light from c stars and m giants brighter than m@xmath55 , @xmath87 was computed for these galaxies , and the results are listed in the middle column of table 5 .",

    "it is evident that @xmath87 varies within and between the galaxies , being lowest in the inner region of ngc 205 , where the youngest stars in the three galaxies are located , and highest in ngc 147 and the outer region of ngc 185 , where there is a lack of the very bright m giants seen in the nuclear regions of ngc 185 and ngc 205 .",
    "based on @xmath87 , it appears that the relative star - forming histories of the outer regions of ngc 147 and ngc 185 during intermediate and moderately recent epochs have been similar , in agreement with what would be inferred from previous comparisons .",
    "the most recent episodes of star formation in galaxies like ngc 185 and ngc 205 likely involve only a modest fraction of the total galaxy mass , and so the integrated @xmath4band light is expected to be dominated by much older populations .",
    "consequently , the ratio of the total light from c stars to the total integrated light from a galaxy will provide insight into the star forming histories at intermediate and old epochs . to investigate such a dependence ,",
    "the fraction of the total @xmath4band light coming from c stars , @xmath89 , was computed using the surface brightness profile for each galaxy in the 2mass extended source catalogue , and the results are listed in the last column of table 5 . the estimated uncertainty in these entries , based on statistical flucuations in the number of c stars , is roughly @xmath90 .",
    "it is evident from table 5 that @xmath89 is roughly constant throughout these galaxies , with c stars contributing 2% of the total @xmath4band light ; the standard deviation about the mean value of @xmath89 is @xmath91 , in rough agreement with what is expected from the uncertainties in @xmath89 .",
    "the system - to - system agreement in the last column of table 5 argues that the star - forming histories of ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 have likely been very similar when averaged over the time scales corresponding to peak c star production - i.e. over gyrs .",
    "based on studies of other systems , it can be anticipated that the majority of the brightest agb stars in these galaxies will likely be lpvs . indeed , the brightest agb stars observed at any given time in a galaxy will almost certainly be lpvs near the peak of their light curves .",

    "the key parameter is the difference in @xmath28 magnitude between the two epochs , @xmath38 .",

    "the dotted lines in figure 18 show the distributions that would be expected if there were no variable stars , based on the errors in the photometry determined from the artificial star experiments .",
    "the @xmath38 distribution in the inner regions of ngc 185 is markedly wider than the predicted photometric uncertainties , indicating that some fraction of the brightest agb stars are variable . for comparison",
    ", the @xmath38 distribution for ngc 205 roughly matches the scatter due to random photometric errors .",
    "as demonstrated below , this does not mean that lpvs are abscent in ngc 205 ; however , the relatively large photometric errors obviously confound efforts to probe the lpv content of this galaxy .",
    "hughes & wood ( 1990 ) investigated the light curves of luminous agb variables in the lmc , and the photometric measurements presented in that study were used to construct a reference @xmath38 distribution for comparison with the ngc 185 and ngc 205 data . following the procedure described by davidge & rigaut ( 2004 ) , individual measurements from hughes & wood ( 1990 ) for lpvs observed in successive observing seasons were paired and @xmath38 was then computed for each pair ; the pairing of points between successive seasons crudely replicates the time baseline between the two cfhtir observing runs .",
    "hughes & wood ( 1990 ) group the lmc stars into large and small amplitude lpvs .",
    "however , the standard deviations in the @xmath38 values obtained from the entries in their tables ii and iii are similar ( @xmath92 versus @xmath93 mag ) , and so the @xmath38 values for both groups of lpvs were combined to create a single reference distribution .    to simulate the effects of observational scatter , the reference @xmath38 distribution constructed from the lmc lpvs was convolved with a gaussian , the standard deviation of which matched the dispersion measured from the artificial star experiments .",
    "in addition , some fraction of bright agb stars are not variable . to account for these objects , a population of non - variable sources , amounting to a fraction @xmath94 of the total number of stars , was modelled as a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation matching the scatter predicted from the artificial star experiments .",
    "non - variable components spanning a range of @xmath94 values were added to the raw reference distributions to create a suite of reference @xmath38 distributions .",
    "a best - fitting value of @xmath94 was found by comparing the observed and modelled @xmath38 distributions and finding the @xmath94 that minimizes the kolomogorov - smirnov d@xmath95 statistic .",
    "the best - fitting models are compared with the observed distributions in figure 18 .",
    "the value of @xmath94 that gave the best match with the observations is listed in the upper left hand corner of each panel .    when applied to the ngc 185 data ,",
    "the fitting procedure described above indicates that @xmath96 ( @xmath58 uncertainty ) .",
    "the agreement between the observed and modelled @xmath38 distribution in the upper panel of figure 18 is not ideal .",
    "the poor agreement between the observed and modelled distributions when @xmath97 suggests that the lpvs in ngc 185 may have a smaller amplitude distribution than those in the lmc , although there is better agreement between the models and observations at positive values of @xmath38 .",
    "models with @xmath98 will better match the ngc 185 distribution near @xmath39 , although at the expense of the fit at very negative values of @xmath38 .",
    "these problems notwithstanding , the value of @xmath94 computed for the inner regions of ngc 185 is consistent with what is seen in other galaxies , such as m32 ( davidge & rigaut 2004 ) and ngc 5128 ( rejkuba et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath94 in ngc 205 is poorly constrained because of the large scatter in the photometric observations ; the relatively large errors with respect to those seen in ngc 185 are a consequence of the greater distance and higher degree of crowding near the center of ngc 205 . while the best fitting model has @xmath99 , other values of @xmath94 yield d@xmath95 values that are not greatly different .",

    "the rgb sequences in ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 suggest that the old stars in these galaxies have metallicities that differ by at most a few tenths of a dex (  1 ) . adopting the [ fe / h ] versus c / m relation in figure 3 of battinelli & demers ( 2005 ) ,",
    "then a difference in 0.3 dex in [ fe / h ] translates into a factor of 3 change in the c / m ratios .",
    "given that at least part of this change in the c / m ratio is driven by a change in the number of m giants , then the c star densities in the three de galaxies might be expected to differ by at most a factor of 3 if they have experienced similar star - forming histories .",
    "the methods used here to compare c star contents rely on integrated quantities involving light from the entire galaxy and the agb , and so are less sensitive to metallicity effects .",
    "that being said , the @xmath51 criterion that is employed here to identify c stars will likely select most of the objects that would be identified in broad and narrow - band photometric surveys at wavelengths shortward of @xmath2 m ( figure 7 of demers et al . 2002 ) . the statistic defined in this study to compare the relative c star densities",
    "that is most closely related to c / m is @xmath87 , which is the fraction of @xmath4band light from the bright portions of the agb that comes from c stars .",
    "the @xmath87 entries in table 5 suggest that this statistic tracks the c / m ratio measurements made by battinelli & demers ( 2005 ) in the sense that @xmath87 is highest in ngc 147 and lowest in ngc 205 .",
    "other methods have been defined here to measure the relative density of c stars , and these suggest that the three de companions of m31 have similar c star densities outside of their nuclear regions .",
    "the fraction of the integrated @xmath4band light that originates from c stars , f@xmath117 , has been computed , and there is only modest galaxy - to - galaxy dispersion in this quantity , which is comparable to that expected from measurement errors alone .",
    "the specific frequency of c stars , where published @xmath4band surface brightness measurements are used to compute the relative numbers of c stars per brightness interval normalized to an integrated brightness m@xmath68 , indicates that there is excellent galaxy - to - galaxy agreement in the c star contents of these galaxies outside of their nuclear regions .",
    "indeed , the comparisons in the lower panel of figure 17 indicate that the specific frequencies of c stars in the main bodies of ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 agree to well within a factor of 2 .",
    "the galaxy - to - galaxy agreement between the specific frequencies of c stars suggests that the star formation rates in the three galaxies , when normalized to the total galaxy masses , have been comparable over time scales of a few gyr .",
    "this has implications for how star formation proceeds in these galaxies , and the source of the gas and dust from which stars form ; that all three galaxies turned the same fractional amount of gas into stars during intermediate epochs suggests that ( 1 ) similar processes regulate star formation in these systems , and/or ( 2 ) the gas that fueled star formation originated in carefully regulated reservoirs .",
    "the three des do not contain large reservoirs of star forming material at the present day (  1 ) .",
    "however , modest amounts of material to fuel star formation can be supplied by low and intermediate mass stars during the advanced phases of their evolution , and this mechanism could provide a supply of star forming material that scales with galaxy mass . however , can mass loss from evolved low and intermediate mass stars provide enough gas to explain the mass of stars that evidently formed in the des during intermediate epochs ? to answer this question we consider ngc 185 as an example , and start by estimating the mass of intermediate age stars in that galaxy .",
    "a lower limit to the mass of intermediate age stars in ngc 185 is estimated in two ways .",
    "the first approach considers the mass of the young nucleus in ngc 185 .",
    "the @xmath4band surface brightness profile of ngc 185 ( jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) indicates that the central cusp has m@xmath118 .",
    "butler & martinez delgado ( 2005 ) find that the cusp has an age @xmath119 year .",
    "the leitherer et al . ( 1999 ) models with a salpeter mass function predict that a simple stellar system with this age and integrated brightness has a mass @xmath120m@xmath121 .",
    "the presence of faint c stars indicates that there has been at least one other episode of star formation in the galaxy during intermediate epochs . assuming that a similar amount of gas was turned into stars then the total mass of stars formed over the past few gyr is at least @xmath122m@xmath123 . assuming a star forming efficiency of 10% , then the mass of gas required is at least @xmath124m@xmath121 .",
    "a second lower limit to the size of the intermediate age population in ngc 185 can be estimated from the properties of the observed agb stars .",
    "stars evolving on the agb make the maximum contribution to the integrated light from a moderately metal - poor simple stellar system when log(t ) @xmath125 ( maraston 1998 ) ; hence , a lower limit to the mass of stars that formed during intermediate epochs can be obtained by assuming that the agb stars have an age of 1 gyr . with 4% of the light coming from agb stars brighter than @xmath126 ( table 5 ) , then the results shown in figure 11 of maraston ( 1998 ) predict that stars that formed during intermediate epochs in ngc 185 account for at least 2.5% of the total galaxy mass , assuming that the intermediate - age population has a mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath4band that is 0.5 that of older populations ( e.g. leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) . with an integrated brightness m@xmath127 ( jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) and an assumed @xmath4band m / l ratio of @xmath84 , then ngc 185 has a total mass of @xmath128 .",
    "the mass of stars that formed during intermediate epochs is then at least @xmath129 . assuming a 10% star - forming efficiency , then the mass of gas required to form these stars is at least @xmath130 , in fortuitous agreement with the lower limit computed in the previous paragraph .",
    "the amount of mass that is injected into the ism by evolved stars is very uncertain , and two estimates are considered here .",
    "gallagher & hunter ( 1981 ) conclude that star formation in ngc 185 is fueled by mass from evolved stars , and derive a mass return rate of @xmath131 year@xmath20 for ngc 185 . for comparison , assuming that the majority of gas from evolved stars is ejected into the ism by planetary nebulae , welch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) compute a mass return rate of @xmath132 year@xmath20 for ngc 185 . adopting these two estimates as upper and lower limits , then the amount of gas that will be returned into the ism in ngc 185 by low and intermediate mass stars over 10 gyr is @xmath133 .",
    "the upper limit of this range is a factor of @xmath3 lower than the minimum amount of gas needed to explain the mass of intermediate age stars computed above .",
    "however , given that gallagher & hunter ( 1981 ) estimate a factor of 2 uncertainty in their mass return rates then the hypothesis that the stars formed in these galaxies during intermediate epochs did so from gas returned to the ism by evolved stars can not be rejected at present .",
    "extremely deep imaging studies in the disk of the des that reach the main sequence turn - off will help establish the age of the intermediate age population and the relative mass of this component with respect to the main body of stars .",
    "this information will allow for a more rigorous test of the source of star - forming material .",
    "[ [ where - did - intermediate - age - stars - in - ngc-147-ngc-185-and - ngc-205-form ] ] where did intermediate age stars in ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 form ?",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in  5 it was demonstrated that the specific frequency of m giants and c stars outside of the central 1 arcmin of the three des are in good agreement ; aside from the obvious central concentrations of moderately young stars near the centers of ngc 185 and ngc 205 , the agb contents of these galaxies appear to be smoothly distributed out to radii of at least a few arcminutes .",
    "there have been multiple episodes of nuclear star formation in ngc 205 , and the time between star forming episodes is consistent with the orbital period around m31 ( davidge 2003 ) .",
    "consequently , it is reasonable to anticipate that tidal interactions trigger the collapse of gas into the central regions of this galaxy , where stars then form .",
    "if star formation occurs near the centers of the des then the nuclear star clusters must be disrupted on time scales of @xmath84 gyr , in order for the progenitors of the c stars to be distributed to larger radii .",
    "however , in order to be disrupted on this time scale then processes other than normal dynamical evolution must be in play .",
    "this can be demonstrated using ngc 185 as an example .",
    "the majority of the youngest stars and star - forming material in ngc 185 are located in a region that is roughly @xmath134 parsecs across .",
    "the velocity dispersion in this part of the galaxy is @xmath135 km / sec ( held et al . 1992 ) , and so the crossing time in the star - forming region is @xmath136 years .",
    "if the young cluster contains @xmath137 stars then equation 8 - 1 of binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) indicates that the relaxation time is @xmath138 years .",
    "if clusters typically survive for @xmath139 relaxation times ( e.g. kim , morris , & lee 1999 ) , then the evaporation time for the central cluster is @xmath140 years .",
    "thus , stars that formed in the ngc 185 nuclear cluster will not be distributed into the main body of ngc 185 via simple dynamical evolution .",
    "if the majority of stars that formed in ngc 185 during the past few gyr did so in the nucleus , then some other process must be involked to hasten their distribution to larger radii .",
    "interactions with m31 are one plausible mechanism for mixing the stellar contents of these galaxies .",
    "indeed , there are indications that ngc 205 , m32 , and m31 have interacted at some point in the past ( cepa & beckman 1988 ; ibata et al . 2001 ; choi et al .",
    "2002 ; mcconnachie et al .",
    "however , van den bergh ( 1998 ) argues that ngc 147 and ngc 185 are a gravitationally bound pair , and that they thus likely do not have plunging orbits that bring them close to m31 , as the binary system would then be disrupted .",
    "battinelli & demers ( 2004b ) point out that there is no evidence for a tidal bridge between these galaxies , and that the separation assumed by van den bergh ( 1998 ) may be underestimated .",
    "indeed , the adopted distances for these galaxies listed in table 1 indicate that they are separated by more than 40 kpc , whereas the projected separation discussed by van den bergh ( 1998 ) is 10 kpc .",
    "therefore , the orbits of ngc 147 and ngc 185 may bring them close enough to m31 to spur star formation .",
