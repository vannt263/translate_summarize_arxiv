    "eulerian lattices provide an interesting , entirely combinatorial model for the combinatorics ( face lattices ) of convex polytopes . although the concepts have been around for a long time ( eulerian posets were formalized by stanley @xcite in 1982 , but the ideas may be traced back at least to klee s paper  @xcite from 1964 ) , there are surprisingly little systematic knowledge and development of eulerian _ lattices _ , despite a number of extensive recent studies of ( the flag vectors of ) eulerian _ posets _ ; cf .",
    "stanley  @xcite .",
    "a complete list of linear relations for the flag vectors of polytopes , spheres and lattices was given by bayer and billera in @xcite , where they proved their generalized dehn - sommerville relations .",
    "in this paper we present a combinatorial construction @xmath5 for eulerian lattices which specializes to the setting of `` strongly regular spheres . '' here the parameter @xmath6 is an integer between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the length of the lattice , and denotes the dimension ( rank plus one ) of the elements that will correspond to coatoms of the new lattice .",
    "the @xmath5-construction may be more intuitive when applied to cellular spheres , but eulerian lattices provide a simple axiomatic setting in which we can most easily analyze the construction and derive its properties .",
    "thus we will start with lattices ( section  [ sec : eulerianlattices ] ) , and in a second step transfer the results to spheres and give a geometric interpretation of the construction ( section  [ sec : cellularspheres ] ) . in some cases",
    "this construction can be performed in the setting of convex polytopes , and then be used to construct interesting new classes of such ( section  [ sec : polytopes ] ) :    we provide the first infinite family of _ rational _",
    "@xmath0-simplicial @xmath0-simple @xmath1-polytopes .",
    "we present for each @xmath10 an infinite family of @xmath3-simplicial @xmath0-simple @xmath4-polytopes .",
    "the first class solves a problem posed by eppstein , kuperberg and ziegler ( @xcite , compare also @xcite ) .",
    "they provided an infinite family of @xmath0-simplicial @xmath0-simple @xmath1-polytopes , but their construction is quite rigid and produces nonrational coordinates .",
    "in contrast , our construction will allow great flexibility for the actual choice of coordinates for a geometric realization of the polytopes in this family .",
    "thus we can also derive a number of consequences for the @xmath11-vector classification problem for @xmath1-dimensional polytopes ( section  [ sec : fvectors ] ) .",
    "the second class of polytopes solves a problem of grnbaum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 9.7.7(iii ) ) and thus substantiates claims by perles and shephard @xcite and by kalai @xcite .    our construction contains the method of eppstein , kuperberg and ziegler as a special case : if we choose @xmath12 and apply @xmath13 to the face lattice of a simplicial @xmath1-polytope @xmath14 whose edges are tangent to the unit sphere , then we obtain the face lattice of a @xmath0-simplicial @xmath0-simple polytope which they call @xmath15 .",
    "thus the second class of examples displayed above is obtained by a generalization of the approach from @xcite to higher dimensions .",
    "in contrast , the construction of the first class relies on the analysis of the dual construction to @xmath13 , which we describe as `` vertex truncation '' in section  [ subsec : vt ] . the special case where @xmath14 is a regular polytope appears in the literature in the context of the construction of regular and `` uniform '' polytopes : here our vertex truncation",
    "can be seen as an instance of `` wythoff s construction '' as described by coxeter ( @xcite and @xcite ) , while a special case of the dual @xmath5-construction appears in gvay s work @xcite .",
