    "the spin hall effect and edge spin accumulation in two - dimensional ( 2d ) structures attracted recently a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "both phenomena are caused by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "there are two essentially different mechanisms of the spin hall effect , extrinsic @xcite which is determined by the properties of impurities , and intrinsic one @xcite , related to spin - orbit coupling in a perfect crystal and associated splitting of the particle spectrum .",
    "the edge electron spin density accumulation , related to the mott asymmetry in electron scattering off impurities , has been recently measured @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the edge spin density in the 2d hole system , which is due to the intrinsic mechanism of the spin - orbit interaction , has also been observed @xcite .",
    "it is quite well established that in the diffusive regime ( and when a spin diffusion length is much larger than a mean free path ) , the spin density appearing near the boundary is the result of the spin flux coming from the bulk @xcite . in the particular case of the rashba hamiltonian",
    "it is still true , though some details depend on the boundary conditions .",
    "for the hard wall case , when the spin current is zero at the boundary , the spin current and the spin density component perpendicular to the plane are zero everywhere down to the sample boundary @xcite . in the case when the boundary condition is the equality of a spin density to zero at the boundary , a spin flux is nonzero within spin precession length near the boundary and is precisely the source of the finite @xmath0 component at the edge @xcite .",
    "this spin flux is directed _ towards _ the boundary and is caused by the electric field existing in the bulk .    till recently the opposite case ,",
    "when the spin precession length @xmath1 is much shorter than the mean - free path , has been studied mostly numerically .",
    "( here @xmath2 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath3 is the spin - orbit - related splitting of the electron spectrum , which we consider to be smaller than the fermi energy , @xmath4 ) .",
    "it includes the case of finite size ballistic structures , when the mean - free path is much larger than the sample size ( a mesoscopic spin hall effect ) .",
    "the existing literature for the ballistic case includes several papers @xcite , where the problem is treated numerically for the systems with the size which is comparable or less than the spin precession length .",
    "there are several analytical studies of the purely ballistic case @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "we found the characteristic scale for the edge spin accumulation in the ballistic case and studied how the scale depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "it was also shown in ref . that the edge spin density in a mesoscopic spin hall effect is not a result of the spin current flowing towards the boundary .    in this paper",
    "we solve analytically the problem of edge spin accumulation for a strong spin - orbit splitting ( @xmath5 ) , but when the size of the structure is much larger than the mean free path @xmath6 , i.e. in the quasi - ballistic regime in our terminology ( @xmath7 is a mean - free time ) .",
    "this case is very important in particular for the reason that it is related to already existing experimental data for 2d holes , see , for example , refs .",
    "the problem of the edge spin accumulation in the quasi - ballistic regime was considered before both numerically and analytically for the linear rashba hamiltonian , see refs .",
    "[ ] , and for 2d holes it was done numerically in ref .",
    "( see the discussion of the results obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] below ) . ref .",
    "[ ] considers the problem numerically using the kinetic equation approach and only studies the case of smooth in transverse direction and straight boundary .",
    "therefore the boundary scattering does not induce transitions between sub - bands with opposite helicity , as a result the authors do not observe any edge spin polarization , except in the corners of the structure .",
    "the problem has been considered analytically in ref .",
    "[ ] for the rashba hamiltonian and for a short - ranged impurity potential in the bulk .",
    "the author concluded that a smooth spin density profile with the scale @xmath8 appears near a boundary .",
    "however , as it is shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , the proper treatment of the scattering problem in the bulk , which determines the correct form of the electron distribution functions , and the use of the unitarity of the boundary scattering @xcite leads to the cancellation of the smooth edge spin density component . in ref .",
    "[ ] only the case of a @xmath9-correlated impurity potential was considered .    in the quasi - ballistic regime",
    "the electric field in the bulk of the sample is finite .",
    "therefore , the distribution functions for the electron states ( i.e. the diagonal components of the spin - density matrix ) are determined by the electric field and by scattering off the impurities in the bulk of a system @xcite .",
    "so far , there is no understanding of the mechanism of the edge spin accumulation in this regime . in this case",
    "two sources of an edge spin accumulation are possible , the first one is due to the spin current coming from the bulk , and the second one is a generation of the edge spin density upon the boundary scattering itself @xcite .",
    "the relative role of those mechanisms has never been studied .",
    "the bulk spin flux is determined by the non - diagonal components of the spin - density matrix .",
    "however , the edge source which is actually studied for the _ ballistic _ rashba case in refs .",
    "@xcite is determined by the diagonal components of the spin density matrix . in the case of a strong spin - orbit splitting ,",
    "when @xmath10 , the contribution of the edge source can be larger since the diagonal components are proportional to the mean - free time , but the non - diagonal ones are not .",
    "it is obvious , that the characteristic length near a boundary , where the spin density arises , is the spin precession length .",
    "since this length is much smaller than a mean - free path , the problem of the edge spin generation can be solved analytically with the use of the scattering states , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spin1 ] .",
    "the occupations of these states ( the distribution functions , which are different from the ballistic case ) are determined by the solution of the kinetic equations for the spin - density matrix in the bulk @xcite , and are the input parameters for the part of the problem related to the scattering by the boundary .",
    "it is important to understand how the phenomenon ( for example , the edge spin density profile ) depends on the character of the bulk scattering , i.e. the smoothness of the impurity potential , and the form of the spin - orbit hamiltonian .",
    "both questions are answered in the present paper .",
    "besides the rashba hamiltonian we also consider the cubic in 2d momentum spin - orbit hamiltonian , i.e. 2d holes , the case which was probed experimentally in refs . .",

    "the scattering amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 take the following form : @xmath31 the amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the incident minus mode with the same @xmath34 and the same energy are obtained from @xmath29 and @xmath30 by replacing @xmath35 .",
    "then for the components of the unitary scattering matrix @xmath36 we obtain @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the group velocities . in the case of rashba",

    "this was the reason for the absence of the smooth spin density near a straight boundary in a ballistic case @xcite .",
    "in the quasi - ballistic case considered here these functions are not equal to each other , we will see that the relation between them depends on the nature of the scattering potential in the bulk .",
    "the kinetic equations for different components of the spin - density matrix in the quasi - ballistic regime ( @xmath5 ) in the presence of an electric field and in the case of arbitrary spin - orbit hamiltonian and arbitrary smoothness of the impurity potential treated in the born approximation were derived in ref .",
