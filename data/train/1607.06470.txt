    "the resulting magnetocrystalline anisotropy is proportional to @xmath84 for a reasonable range of @xmath10 .",

    "we perform similar calculations for a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice as well as a square lattice discussed here .",
    "the results are present in appendix  [ sec(a):hexagonal ] .",
    "the dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy on @xmath10 differs from the corresponding dependence of many other phenomena of spin - orbit coupling origin . in the previous sections ,",
    "we show by symmetry that the magneocrystalline anisotropy is independent of the sign of @xmath10 . as a result , it is quadratic in @xmath10 for a reasonable range of @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , other phenomena of spin - orbit origin such as spin - orbit torque and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction have a linear contribution in @xmath10 .",
    "this feature has clear experimental implications . when a magnetic layer has two interfaces with opposite rashba parameters , the total spin - orbit torques and the total dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction arising from the both interfaces are zero since they are odd in @xmath10 and the contributions from the two interfaces mutually cancel each other .",
    "however , such cancellation does not occur for the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the contributions from the two interfaces add up since the anisotropy is even in @xmath10 .",
    "a similar phenomenon persists even when only one interface of a magnetic layer is subject to strong inversion asymmetry , if there are multiple energy bands .",
    "it is demonstrated  @xcite that multiple bands for a given interface may experience different signs of the rashba spin - orbit coupling . in such a situation , it is possible that contributions of those bands to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy can add up whereas their contributions to the linear spin - orbit phenomena such as spin - orbit torque and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction tend to cancel out .",
    "this observation indicates that simple proportionality analysis in experiments may fail to capture the correlation between the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and other phenomena of spin - orbit coupling origin .    in this sense , our observation can be consistent with a recent experiment  @xcite reporting the opposite behaviors of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ir / co / alo@xmath131 multilayers for various thickness of co. according to the work , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction reduces as the thickness of co increases , while the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy increases .",
    "this difference may originate from multiple origins of the spin - orbit coupling phenomena , such as multiple interfaces and multiple orbital bands . as the thickness of co increases , the contributions to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction may cancel out while those to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy should add up .",
    "one remark is in order .",
    "although our theory demonstrate that the positive correlation between the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and other spin - orbit coupling phenomena may breakdown , it is not necessarily the explanation of the breakdown observed in ref .",
    "[ ] because there are other sources of magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "we observe that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy depends on the total electron density [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tb - numerical](a ) ] and it can even change its sign . the strong dependence of magnetocrystaline anisotropy on the total electron density is another feature that requires a well - controlled experiment to observe the correlation .",
    "when one varies the experimental conditions to obtain systems with various spin - orbit coupling parameters , the total electron density at the interface may change , which disturbs clear interpretation of the dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy on the spin - orbit coupling parameter .",
    "the density - dependent magnetocrystalline anisotropy opens another route of the voltage - controlled magnetic anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "the voltage - controlled magnetic anisotropy received considerable attention due to its significant potential to enhance the efficiency of spintronic devices .",
    "there are previous theories  @xcite suggesting that modulating the rashba parameter by applying an external voltage is a possible route of the voltage - controlled magnetic anisotropy . however , it is unlikely to be a main mechanism in metallic ferromagnetic films in which a nominal potential gradient is not a main mechanism generating rashba parameters  @xcite .",
    "an external electric field is shielded by electron screening in the metal , thus it is difficult to change the rashba parameter significantly . on the other hand , density variations by doping or",
    "an external voltage can change the electron density at the interface , changing the interfacial contributions to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy significantly .",
    "the conclusion from the simple model is consistent with first - principle studies  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we compute the magnetoctrystalline anisotropy for simple ferromagnetic rashba models .",
    "the properties dramatically change depending on the dispersion relations . for a free electron ( quadratic ) dispersion",
    ", the system does not acquire perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at all .",
    "more interestingly , we analytically show that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is _ exactly _ zero regardless of the rashba coupling strength if both majority and minority bands are partially occupied in the ground state .",
    "this result is not consistent with experimental observations , implying that a free electron dispersion is not suitable for studying perpendicular magnetic anisotropy arising from the rashba interaction .",
    "we thus generalize the model to have a finite band width , which necessarily generates deviation from the free electron dispersion .",
    "we start from tight - binding hamiltonians and conclude that the system acquires perpendicular magnetic anisotropy over wide range of parameters , consistent with experimental observations .",
    "a finite band width is a crucial feature of the tight - binding hamiltonians that gives rise to perpendicular magnetic anisotropy .",
    "we also observe that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy depends on the band filling and it can even change its sign .",
    "we argue that the interface electron density modulation by voltage is a more important cause of voltage - controlled magnetic anisotropy than the voltage - controlled modulation of the rashba parameter is .",
    "our results show the possibility of breakdown of positive correlation between perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and other spin - orbit coupling phenomena .",
