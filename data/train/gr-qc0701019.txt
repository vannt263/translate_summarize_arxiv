    "one of the prerogatives of a wormhole is its ability to connect two distant points in space - time . in this amazing perspective , it is immediate to recognize the possibility of traveling crossing wormholes as a short - cut in space and time .",
    "unfortunately , although there is no direct evidence , a schwarzschild wormhole does not possess this property .",

    "exotic_. it is clear that the existence of dark and phantom energy supports the class of exotic matter . in this direction , lobo@xcite , kuhfittig@xcite and sushkov@xcite have considered the possibility of sustaining the wormhole traversability with the help of phantom energy . in a previous work",
    ", we explored the possibility that a wormhole can be sustained by its own quantum fluctuations@xcite . in practice , it is the graviton propagating on the wormhole background that plays the role of the _ exotic _  matter .",
    "this has not to appear as a surprise , because the computation involved , namely the one loop contribution of the graviton to the total energy , is quite similar to compute the casimir energy on a fixed background .",
    "it is known that , for different physical systems , casimir energy is negative and this is exactly one of the features that the exotic matter should possess . in particular , we conjectured that quantum fluctuations can support the traversability as effective source of the semiclassical einstein s equations .",
