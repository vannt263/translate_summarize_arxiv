    "in contrast to a phase transition at finite temperature , which is driven by thermal fluctuations , a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) is characterized by quantum fluctuations between the ordered and disordered state . although the qcp at @xmath1 is experimentally not accessible , these quantum fluctuations drastically influence many physical properties even at finite temperatures .",
