    "the non - thermal electrons responsible for the radio emission originate in magnetospheric regions far from the stellar surface , where the kinetic energy density of the gas is high enough to brake the magnetic field lines forming current sheets .",
    "these regions are the sites where the mildly relativistic electrons originate . in the magnetic equator , at around the alfvn radius , there is a transitional magnetospheric `` layer '' between the inner confined plasma and the escaping wind .",

    "hr7355 violates the empirical relation coupling the x - ray and radio luminosities of magnetically active stars ( @xmath53 hz , @xcite ) , which is valid among stars distributed within a wide range of spectral classes ( from f to early m stars ) .",
    "this is clear evidence that the physical mechanisms for the radio and x - ray emissions operating in an early b - star like hr7355 are distinct from coronal mechanisms operating in the intermediate- and low - mass main sequence stars . yet , somewhat surprisingly , the deviation of the early type hr7355 from the gudel ",
    "benz relation is similar to that for the stars at the bottom of the main sequence  the ultra cool dwarfs with spectral type later than m7 @xcite .",
    "these important similarities between active ultra cool dwarfs and a strongly magnetic b star indicate that radio and x - ray emission in their magnetospheres may be produced by related physical mechanisms and provide useful hints for the latter .",
    "according to the mcws model , the thermal plasma responsible for x - ray emissions from magnetic b - type stars is produced by stellar wind streams colliding at the magnetic equator .",
    "the radio wavelengths are instead sensitive to only the cold thermal plasma that accumulates at the higher magnetic latitudes .",
    "consequently , the x - ray emission provides a different set of constraints on the physical conditions in the magnetosphere of hr7355 .",
    "we have analyzed the archival _ xmm - newton _  measurements .",
    "first , the observed spectrum in 0.2 - 10.0kev band was fit with a thermal two - temperature spectral model that assumes optically thin plasma in collisional equilibrium .",

    "this is significantly hotter than usually found in magnetic b - stars @xcite .    in the framework of the mcws model ,",
    "the wind plasma streams that collide at the magnetic equator give rise to a shock that heats the plasma .",
    "hence , the maximum temperature follows from a rankine - hugoniot condition and can not exceed a value determined by the maximum stellar wind velocity .    in the analysis presented in sect.[sec : radiodiagnostic ] , we assumed two distinct wind velocities , 500kms@xmath5 and 1000kms@xmath5 , that encompass values plausible for a main sequence b - type star @xcite . using eq.10 from @xcite",
    ", we estimate the maximum plasma temperatures that can be produced via a magnetically confined wind shock for these two wind speeds ; these temperatures are respectively : 3.5mk and 14mk  significantly lower than that deduced from the x - ray spectral analysis",
    ".    this led us to conclude that the assumption of the hard part of x - ray spectrum being produced by the hot thermal plasma is not realistic .",
    "therefore , as a next step , we attempted to fit the hr7355 spectra with an absorbed power - law model , however no satisfactory fit could be obtained .",
    "finally , we fit the observed x - ray spectrum by combining thermal and power - law models .",

    "[ fig_xray ] . a high - quality fit",
    "with reduced @xmath55 for 89 degrees of freedom was obtained .",
    "based on spectral fitting , the 2 t thermal model has no preference over a model that combines thermal and power - law ( non - thermal ) components .",
    "the model fit parameters are shown in table  [ par_xray ] .",
    "the temperature of the thermal x - ray plasma in this combined model , @xmath56 mk , is easier to reconcile with a typical wind velocity of a b2v star .",
    "a more complex model involving two temperatures plus a power - law , can also be fit to the observed spectra , yielding marginally better fitting statistics , however we choose the simplest models .    to investigate on the origin of the power - law x - ray component in the hr7355 spectrum , it is useful to consider the sun .",
    "the solar flare x - ray spectrum usually shows a hard x - ray component with a power - law energy distribution @xcite , well explained as bremsstrahlung from a non - thermal electron population @xcite . for the non - thermal bremsstrahlung emission , the observed x - ray spectral index ( @xmath0 )",
    "is related to the spectral index ( @xmath57 ) of the injected non - thermal electrons . for a thick - target bremsstrahlung emission , @xmath57 and @xmath0",
    "are related as follow : @xmath58 . in the case of hr7355 , if we assume that its power - law x - ray emission is generated by the impact with the stellar surface of the same non - thermal electron population responsible of the gyro - synchrotron radio emission , it is possible to estimate a value @xmath59 of the spectral index of these energetic electrons .",
    "the simulation of the radio emission of hr7355 indicates that the non - thermal electrons have a spectral index of @xmath602.5 .",
    "the above range of values is not quite consistent with the value derived by the spectrum of the x - ray photons , but is however close .",
    "this suggests that the thick - target bremsstrahlung emission from a non - thermal electron population that impacts with the stellar surface is a plausible explanation for the origin of the power - law component detected in the x - ray spectrum of hr7355 .",
    "similarly to the solar case , it is likely that not only electrons , but also protons are accelerated in hr7355 . in some solar flares the observable effects of these two different populations of high energy particles have been recognized in the x- and the gamma - ray domain .",
    "the electrons radiate hard x - rays by thick - target bremsstrahlung emission , whereas the protons , that interact with the ions at the stellar surface , radiate gamma - rays ( see @xcite and references here reported ) .",
    "these effects , if present , will open a new high energy observational window to the hot magnetic stars .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this power - law x - ray spectral component has an important difference with the case of solar flares . during a solar flare ,",
    "the energetic electrons are impulsively injected , whereas for hot star magnetospheres , the non - thermal electrons are continuously accelerated .",
    "the latter mechanism is similar to the auroras from the magnetized planets in the solar system .",
    "thus , we suggest that the x - ray emission from hr7355 is physically analogous to the x - ray from jupiter s aurora as measured by _ xmm - newton _  in november 2003 . the jovian x - ray spectrum has been modeled using a combination of thermal and power - law components @xcite .",
    "the power - law x - ray component dominates at the high energies of the _ xmm - newton _  spectral range ( x - ray photons with energies higher then 2 kev ) , and is explained in terms of bremsstrahlung emission of the precipitating electrons with energies of @xmath61 kev @xcite .",
    "this high - energy electron population is generated far from the planet ( 2030 jupiter radii ) , in the co - rotation breakdown region of jupiter s magnetosphere .",
    "the mechanism we propose for the non - thermal electron acceleration in hot magnetic stars resembles the acceleration of high - energy electrons in jupiter s atmosphere . for the stellar magnetospheres , the co - rotation background region coincides with the equatorial current sheet outside the alvn radius ( see fig .",
    "[ modello ] ) .",
    "the non - thermal electrons are responsible for the gyro - synchrotron radio emission of hr7355 and have a power - law energy distribution with a low - energy cutoff at 100kev .",
    "these particles can be , also , responsible for the power - law component in the hr7355 x - ray spectrum , as a consequence of the bremsstrahlung at the stellar surface . in this case",
    ", the bremsstrahlung x - ray emission arises from an annular region around the pole .",
    "the existence of a well defined spatial location of the hard x - ray source region could produce a smooth modulation of the x - ray emission as the star rotates .",
    "unfortunately the short archival _ xmm - newton _  observations did not sample the stellar rotation period , so no conclusions can be drawn yet about the variability of the power - law component in the hr7355 x - ray spectrum .",
    "we intend to remedy this observational shortcoming in future .    in figure  [ sezione_x ] we present the model sketch that may explain simultaneously the radio and the x - ray emission of hr7355 .",
    "the thermal x - ray component arises from the hot plasma that is shocked by the impact between stellar wind flows from opposing stellar hemispheres .",
    "the colder thermal plasma that accumulates in the the inner - magnetosphere does not significantly contribute to the x - rays , but explains the rotational modulation of the radio emission .",
    "the stellar radio emission originates from a non - thermal electron population moving inside the magnetic cavity that is defined by the field lines that intercept the magnetic equator outside the alvn radius , coinciding with the magnetospheric regions where the co - rotation breakdown take place , and where the current sheet systems accelerate the electrons up to relativistic energies .",
    "these precipitating non - thermal electrons could give rise to stellar auroral signatures , like the non - thermal x - ray emission from the polar caps .",
    "the non - thermal electron population injected in the stellar magnetosphere close to the alfvn radius , and which moves toward the star , is responsible for the incoherent gyro - synchrotron radio emission of hr7355 .",
    "the electrons with velocities almost parallel with the magnetic field lines ( i.e. , low pitch angle ) can deeply penetrate within the stellar magnetosphere , and are responsible for the x - ray auroral spectral features , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_xray ] .",
    "non - thermal electrons that impact the stellar surface are lost to the magnetosphere . as a consequence ,",
    "the distribution of the non - thermal electrons reflected outside ( by the magnetic mirroring ) will be deprived of electrons with quite low pitch - angle values .",
    "this is a suitable condition to develop the unstable electron energy distribution , known as the loss - cone distribution @xcite .",
    "this inverted electron velocity distribution can trigger the coherent electron cyclotron maser ( ecm ) emission mechanism .",
    "the ecm amplifies the extraordinary magneto - ionic mode , producing highly circularly polarized radiation ( @xmath62 ) , at frequencies close to the first few harmonics of the local gyro - frequency ( @xmath63 ghz ) ; however , the fundamental harmonic is probably suppressed by gyro - magnetic absorption effects @xcite .",
    "the ecm is the process that generates the broad - band auroral radio emission of the magnetized planets of the solar system @xcite , of the two magnetic stars cuvir @xcite and hd133880 @xcite , and , of the ultra cool dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the auroral radio emission arises from the thin density - depleted magnetic cavity related to the auroral oval at the polar caps .",
    "this kind of coherent radio emission is efficiently amplified within a narrow beam pattern tangentially directed along the cavity wall ( i.e. , the laminar source model , @xcite ) , giving rise to a radio light house effect . in the case of the earth auroral kilometric radiation ( akr ) , this highly directional coherent radiation is upward refracted by the dense thermal plasma trapped outside the auroral cavity @xcite .    the auroral radio emission from cuvir was first discovered at 1.4 ghz as intense ( @xmath64 order of magnitude brighter then the incoherent radio emission ) radio pulses that were 100% circularly polarized @xcite .",
    "this amplified emission from cuvir has also been detected at 2.5 ghz @xcite , and at 600 mhz @xcite .",
    "the pulse arrival times are observed to be a function of the observing frequency @xcite , a signature of frequency - dependent refractive effects suffered by the cuvir auroral radio emission .",
    "the radio pulses , related to the auroral radio emission from a dipole - shaped magnetosphere , occur when the magnetic dipole axis lies in the plane of the sky ( cross - over phases ) , with a duration of 510% of the rotational period .",
    "the features of the auroral radio emission arising from the cuvir magnetosphere has been successfully modeled using a simple dipole shape @xcite .",
    "our source hr7355 has a stellar geometry , rotation , and magnetic dipole obliquity suitable for detection of its auroral radio emission .",
    "in fact , as evident from the top panel of fig .  [ fase_coverage ] , the curve for the magnetic field shows a change of net polarity twice per rotation .",
    "the phase coverage of the radio observations presented in this paper has good sampling at the cross - over phases at each observing frequency ( see bottom panel of fig .  [ fase_coverage ] ) . at the frequencies ranging from 6 to 44 ghz",
    ", the radio measurements of hr7355 do not show any hint of auroral radio emission .",
    "as previously explained , the stellar auroral radio emission at a given frequency originates in the magnetospheric regions where the second harmonic of the local gyro - frequency is close to the observing frequency . in the case of cuvir ( @xmath65 [ gauss ] , @xcite ) ,",

    ", we note that the thermal plasma trapped within the magnetosphere of hr7355 has a higher density as compared to cuvir .",
    "the auroral radio emission arising from the deeper magnetospheric layers of hr7355 may suffer absorption effects .",
    "up to now , we have no radio measurements at frequencies below 6 ghz , corresponding to layers further out in radius where conditions would be more conducive for the detection of auroral radio emission from hr7355 .",
    "consequently , it is not possible at this time to draw firm conclusions regarding the production of auroral radio emission at hr7355 .",
    "in this paper we have presented an extensive analysis of the rigidly rotating magnetosphere of the fast rotating b2v star , hr7355 .",

    "the total ( stokes i ) and the circularly polarized ( stokes v ) flux density are variable .",
    "the radio data have been phase folded using the stellar rotation period , demonstrating that the radio variability is a consequence of the rotation .",
    "the rotational phases have been well sampled , allowing us to build multi - wavelength radio light curves separately in stokes i and v. modeling of the stellar radio emission , using a 3d model that simulates the radio emission from a rigidly rotating stellar magnetosphere shaped by a simple dipole @xcite , allows us to constrain the physical conditions in the magnetosphere of hr7355 . as result of the present analysis , the wind mass - loss rate of hr7355 has been indirectly derived .",
    "independently , we obtained constrains on mass - loss rate from the analysis of archival uv spectra of hr7355 by means of the non - lte stellar atmosphere model powr .",

    "the magnetosphere of hr7355 was compared with that of cuvir , another magnetic star studied with the same modeling approach .",
    "the comparison reveals that both these stars are characterized by centrifugal magnetospheres but , the same time , have significant differences .",
    "the cm of hr7355 , as normalized to the stellar radius is larger , and the regions where the non - thermal electrons are generated are characterized by a stronger local magnetic field strength , with respect to the case of cuvir , with a consequent effect on the radio brightness of the two stars .    the analysis presented in this paper allows us to estimate the average physical conditions of the thermal plasma confined within the magnetospheric region .",
    "absorption effects by the trapped plasma influences the emerging stellar radio emission and plays a key role for the modeling of the radio light curves .",
    "the measured thermal x - ray emission from hr7355 could be explained as a consequence of the shock heating of the colliding wind streams arising from the two opposite stellar hemispheres .",
    "the fit to the x - ray spectrum of hr7355 suggests a presence of a non - thermal x - ray component described by a power law .",
    "the spectral index of the non - thermal x - ray photons is compatible with the thick target bremsstrahlung emission generated by the non - thermal electron population , which are responsible for the observed radio emission , that impact with the stellar surface close to the polar caps .",
    "this could be the signature for auroral x - ray emission from hr7355 .",
    "stellar rotation can lead to greater x - ray emissions than predicted by the scaling laws in the framework of the mcws model @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite point out that even taking rotation into account , there are some hot magnetic stars that are too bright in the x - ray band , one of them being hr7355 .",
    "our new model suggests that auroral x - ray emission is a likely additional mechanism that increases x - ray production and can account for the strong x - rays from hr7355 .",
    "we speculate that auroral mechanism operates in other hot magnetic stars that display hard and bright x - ray emission .",
    "the auroral phenomenon also gives rise to features at radio wavelengths , such as coherent pulses with @xmath73 100% circular polarization that occur at predictable rotational phases .",
    "this radio lighthouse phenomena has been recognized in the magnetized planets of the solar system , among some ultra cool dwarfs , and in two hot magnetic stars , with the prototype cuvir . for the stellar auroral radio emission to be detectable",
    ", the stellar magnetic dipole must to be oriented with the axis lying in the plane of the sky ( null effective magnetic field ) .",
    "the stellar geometry of hr7355 is favorable for detecting this coherent emission , in fact the magnetic field curve inverts the sign twice per period .",
    "we do not however find any signature of auroral radio emission from hr7355 , at least in the frequency range 644 ghz .",
    "for this frequency range , we suggest that the auroral radio emission originates deep inside the stellar magnetosphere and is strongly absorbed . new observations at lower frequencies , corresponding to less deep layers , could reveal whether auroral radio emissions are in fact produced the magnetosphere of hr7355 .",
    "we want to underscore that the synergistic radio and x - ray analysis is a powerful combination that can led to strong constraints for the stellar magnetospheric conditions of hot magnetic stars . from the results of the radio modeling simulations and the x - ray spectral analysis of hr7355",
    ", we have been able to outline a physical scenario that simultaneously explains features detected at opposite ends of the source spectrum .",
