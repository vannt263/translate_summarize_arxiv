    "the duality computer , or duality quantum computer exploits the wave - particle duality of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "it has been proven that a moving @xmath0-qubit duality computer passing through a @xmath1-slits can be perfectly simulated by an ordinary quantum computer with @xmath0-qubit and an additional @xmath1 levels qudit @xcite .",
    "so we do not need to build a moving quantum computer device which is very difficult to realize .",
    "this also indicates that we can perform duality quantum computing in an ordinary quantum computer , in the so - called duality quantum computing mode @xcite .",
    "there have been intensive interests in the theory of duality computer in recent years @xcite , and experimental studies have also been reported @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s2 ] , we briefly describe the generalized quantum gate , the divider and combiner operations . section [ s3 ] reviews the duality quantum computing mode , which enables the implementation of duality quantum computing in an ordinary quantum computer . in section [ s4 ] , we outline the main results of mathematical theory of duality quantum computer . in section [ s5 ] ,",

    "some unitary operations are performed on the sub - waves at different slits .",
    "they are then collected at the 0-slit in the rightmost screen , and this is the quantum wave combiner operation .",
    "the result is then read - out by the detector placed at the 0-slit on the right wall .",
    ", width=340 ]    in a duality quantum computer , the two new operations are the quantum wave divider ( qwd ) operation and quantum wave combiner ( qwc ) operation @xcite .",
    "the qwd operation divides the wave function into many identical parts with reduced amplitudes .",
    "the physical picture of this division is simple and natural : a quantum system passing through a @xmath1-slits with its wave function being divided into @xmath1 sub - waves .",
    "each of the sub - waves has the same internal wave function and are different only in the center of mass motion characterized by the slit .",
    "conversely , the combiner operation adds up all the sub - waves into one wave function .",
    "it should be noted that one divides the wave function of the same quantum system into many parts in quantum divider , whereas in quantum cloning one copies the state of one quantum system onto another quantum system @xcite(which may also holds true for classical systems@xcite ) .",
    "so , the division operation does not violate the non - cloning theorem .",
    "considering a quantum wave divider corresponding to a quantum system passing through a @xmath1-slits . writing the direct sum of hilbert space @xmath2 as the form of @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the divider structure characteristics which describes the properties of a quantum wave divider can be denoted as @xmath6 where each @xmath7 is a complex number with a module less than 1 and satisfy @xmath8 .",
    "the divider operator @xmath9 which maps @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath5 .",
    "this is the most general form of the divider operator , and it describes a general multi - slits . in a special case ,",
    "the multi - slits are @xmath1 identical slits , then @xmath13 .",

    "the combiner structure is uniform .",
    "now , we consider the uniform divider and combiner structures which correspond to @xmath13 and @xmath19 , respectively . in this case , the combined operations of divider and combiner leave the state unchanged .",
    "the process can be described as follows @xmath20 if the divider structure and combiner structure satisfy certain relation , this property also holds .",
    "the details will be given in the next section .",
    "it will be shown later in the next section that the divider and combiner structure @xmath9 and @xmath14 can be expressed by a column or a row of elements of a unitary matrix respectively . for duality",
    "quantum gates with the form of @xmath21 in eq.([e3 ] ) , the relation of the two unitary matrices makes the structures of @xmath14 and @xmath9 adjoint of each other .",

    ", @xmath24 is denoted by @xmath26 , and they are constrained by the condition of @xmath27 . the real duality gate is denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "so , the real duality quantum gate can be rewritten as @xmath28 this corresponds to a physical picture of an asymmetric @xmath1-slits , and @xmath26 is the probability that the duality computer system passes through the @xmath29-th slit .    according to the definition of duality quantum gates , they are generally non - unitary",
    ". it naturally provides the capability to perform non - unitary evolutions .",
    "for instance , dynamic evolutions in open quantum systems should be simulated in such machines .",
    "more interestingly , it is an important issue to study the computing capabilities of duality quantum computing .",
    "an important step toward this direction is that wang , du and dou @xcite proposed an theorem which limits what can not be a duality gate in a hilbert space with infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "the divider operation can be expressed by a general unitary operation @xmath30 and the combiner operation can be expressed by another general unitary operation @xmath31 .",
    "the two unitary operations are implemented on an auxiliary qudit which represents a @xmath1-slits .",

    "the @xmath1 energy levels of the qudit represent the @xmath1-slits .",
    "we divide the duality computing processing into four steps to reveal the computing theory in a quantum computer .",
    "step one : preparing the initial quantum system @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the initial state . then performing the divider operation by implement the @xmath30 on the auxiliary qudit , and this operation transforms the initial state into @xmath40 @xmath41 is the first column element of the unitary matrix @xmath30 representing the coefficient in each slit .",
    "@xmath42 denotes the divider structure .",
    "note that @xmath41 is a complex number with @xmath43 and satisfies @xmath44 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we firstly briefly review the duality quantum computer . distinctly , the generalized quantum gates , the basic evolution operators in a duality quantum computer are no longer unitary , and they can be expressed in terms of linear combinations of unitary operators . </S>",
    "<S> all linear bounded operators can be realized in a duality quantum computer , and unitary operators are just the extreme points of the set of generalized quantum gates . </S>",
    "<S> a d - slits duality quantum computer can be realized in an ordinary quantum computer with an additional qudit using the duality quantum computing mode . </S>",
    "<S> duality quantum computer provides flexibility and clear physical picture in designing quantum algorithms , serving as a useful bridge between quantum and classical algorithms . in this review </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that duality quantum computer can simulate quantum systems more efficiently than ordinary quantum computers by providing descriptions of the recent efficient quantum simulation algorithms of childs et al [ quantum information & computation , 12(11 - 12 ) : 901 - 924 ( 2012 ) ] for the fast simulation of quantum systems with a sparse hamiltonian , and the quantum simulation algorithm by berry et al [ phys . </S>",
