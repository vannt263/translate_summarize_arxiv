    "we expect that also the exact @xmath107 is only very weakly @xmath2-dependent as in the ideal quantum ( @xmath7 ) and classical limits @xcite .",

    "let us now repeat the above calculations with excitations ( i ) and ( ii ) , now starting from a symmetric initial coordinate wave function @xmath108 . according to the bose - fermi mapping in @xmath11 @xcite it is expected , that both initial states , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , should lead to the same qbm .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that both numerical approaches to solve the tdse ( see sec .",
    "[ numerics_ss ] ) fail to reproduce this behavior , due to the singularity of the coulomb potential .",
    "the standard `` regularization '' procedure which introduces a small finite cut - off @xmath100 in the potential , @xmath110 , yields qualitatively wrong results for @xmath61 , cf .",
    "[ fig:1d_boson ] .",
    "the breathing frequency @xmath61 exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on @xmath1 , in contrast to the solution of the tdse for an anti - symmetric initial state . reducing the cut - off parameter @xmath100",
    "slightly improves the behavior by reducing the amplitude of the oscillation and shifting it towards smaller values of @xmath1 .",
    "but even for @xmath100 as small as @xmath111 the spurious oscillation persists for @xmath112 , and no convergence to the behavior of the anti - symmetric state is observed .",
    "we underline that this is not a numerical error and not due to the solution procedure , but it is a property of the regularized coulomb potential in @xmath31 .",
    "the reason for the observed unexpected behavior is the incorrect ( finite ) value of the relative wave function @xmath113 at the origin ( i.e. at zero particle separation ) .",

    "consequently , we expect a lowering of @xmath61 for symmetric states , compared to anti - symmetric ones , for arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "this is fully confirmed by numerical solutions of the tdse @xcite , cf .",
    "[ fig:2d_breathing ] .",
    "the overall behavior is the same as in @xmath31  we observe a qbm with @xmath53 and a second mode @xmath118 , however , its value is different from @xmath31 : the frequency is reduced ( increased ) for an ( anti-)symmetric state , cf . fig .  [ fig:2d_breathing ] . while the differences vanish in the classical ( and quantum ) limits due to missing ( complete ) wave function overlap , at intermediate couplings , around @xmath39 , the differences between @xmath31 and @xmath114 , as well as between anti - symmetric and symmetric states are substantial , reaching values of about @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "these differences render the qbm frequency @xmath118 a sensitive diagnostics of the spin statistics of the particles .",
    "indeed , in case of a symmetric spin wave function ( e.g. spin - polarized system in a strong magnetic field ) , the anti - symmetric ( symmetric ) relative coordinate wave function @xmath121 refers to fermions ( bosons ) and , vice versa , in case of an anti - symmetric spin wave function . furthermore , in case of a mixture of fermions and bosons , the resonance absorption ( ii ) yields information about the fraction of the different components .",
    "while our results have been obtained for systems with a spin - independent hamiltonian , it is straightforward to perform analogous tdse calculations with spin effects included .",
    "another interesting observation is that @xmath107 in @xmath31 and @xmath114 for the wave function @xmath122 is well described by the functional form @xmath123+d , \\\\",

    "in this paper we have presented a complete analysis of the quantum breathing modes of interacting charged particles in a @xmath31 and @xmath114 harmonic trap for arbitrary values of the coupling strength @xmath1 .",
    "the results are based on accurate solutions of the tdse with two independent excitation scenarios and differ qualitatively from previous results based on hydrodynamic models .",
    "we have shown that the frequency ratio @xmath128 , while being independent of the trap frequency and the confining system , does depend on the trap dimensionality and on fundamental properties of the particles : their spin statistics and the form of their pair interaction .",
    "furthermore the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath129 is a sensitive measure of the strength of many - body effects in the particle ensemble .",
    "the present results have been obtained for two particles with coulomb interaction where exact solutions of the tdse are possible . nevertheless , they are representative for any nonideal quantum system in a harmonic trap .",
    "an analogous but different @xmath14dependence exists for dipole interaction @xcite and for short - range potentials .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath1 , @xmath50 is indicative of the form of the pair interaction .    while our results are of importance for any nonideal quantum system in a harmonic trap , they are of particular relevance for electrons @xcite and excitons @xcite in quantum dots as well as for bose and fermi systems and their mixtures in traps or optical lattices . there",
    "the resonance absorption by the qbm , in particular , the relative spectral weight of the two modes , may serve as a valuable experimental diagnostics .",
    "thereby one can take advantage of the comparatively easy excitation of the breathing mode using the excitation scenarios i or ii .    at the same time the presented precise values of @xmath130 provide a strong benchmark for nonequilibrium theoretical models and computational many - body methods for finite systems , including hydrodynamics , tdhf and time - dependent density functional theory and nonequilibrium greens functions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the normal modes of trapped systems are an important criterion for the quality of nonequilibrium simulations which treat the interaction approximately .",
    "this is in complete analogy to approximate simulations of atoms which should reproduce the excitation energy spectrum as accurately as possible .",
    "recently it was shown that the sloshing ( kohn ) mode of a harmonically trapped system is preserved exactly by any conserving many - body approximation @xcite .",
    "similarly , the breathing mode may serve as such a constraint .",
    "for example , as was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] , the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation behaves very well for an anti - symmetric initial state ( fermions ) . for symmetric states ( bosons ) hartree - fock simulations of",
    "strongly correlated charged systems in a harmonic trap have recently been developed @xcite but the results for the breathing mode appear to be significantly less accurate than for fermions .    finally , a particularly remarkable observation made in our paper is the persistence of the center of mass quantum breathing mode with frequency @xmath51 up to very large @xmath1 values . in strongly coupled systems",
    "this mode shows up in a `` breathing '' of _ each individual particle _ ( see lower left part of fig .",

    "despite the fact that for strong coupling , the collective quantum degeneracy effects are weak ( the interparticle distance is much smaller than @xmath131 ) each individual particle clearly `` remembers '' its quantum nature .",
    "note that for other types of excitation other center of mass motions will be observed . in particular , a dipole excitation will give rise to the familiar sloshing or kohn mode which is independent of @xmath2 , dimensionality , interaction or quantum and spin effects .",
