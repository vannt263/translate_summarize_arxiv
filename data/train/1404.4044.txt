    "the notion of gravitational mass for a composite body is known to be non - trivial in general relativity and related to several paradoxes . the role of the classical virial theorem in establishing of the equivalence between averaged over time",
    "gravitational mass and energy is discussed in detail in refs.[1,2 ] for different types of classical composite bodies . in particular , for electrostatically bound two bodies , it is shown that the gravitational field is coupled to a combination @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the kinetic energy and @xmath2 the potential energy . since the classical virial theorem states that the following time average is equal to zero , @xmath3",
    ", we can conclude that averaged over time gravitational mass is proportional to the total amount of energy , @xmath4 [ 1,2 ] : @xmath5",
    "the main goal of our paper is to study the quantum problem concerning the passive gravitational mass of a composite body . as the simplest example , we consider a hydrogen atom in the earth s gravitational field , where we take into account only kinetic and coulomb potential energies of an electron in a curved spacetime .",
    "we claim three main results in the paper ( see also refs . [ 3,4 ] ) .",
    "our first result is that the equivalence between passive gravitational mass and energy in the absence of gravitational field survives , at the macroscopic level , in the quantum case .",
    "more strictly speaking , we show that the expectation value of the mass is equal to @xmath6 for stationary quantum states due to the quantum virial theorem [ 5 ] .",
    "our second result is a breakdown of the equivalence between passive gravitational mass and energy , at the microscopic level , for stationary quantum states due to the fact that passive gravitational mass operator does not commute with energy operator . as a result",
    ", there exist a non - zero probability that a measurement of passive gravitational mass can yield a value , which is different from @xmath6 , given by the einstein s equation .",
    "our third result is a suggestion of a realistic experiment to detect this inequivalence by measurement of electromagnetic radiation , emitted by a macroscopic ensemble of hydrogen atoms , supported by and moving in the earth s gravitational field , using spacecraft or satellite .",
    "here , we derive the lagrangian and hamiltonian of a hydrogen atom in the earth s gravitational field , taking into account couplings of kinetic and potential coulomb energies of an electron with a weak gravitational field .",
    "note that we keep only terms of the order of @xmath7 and disregard all tidal effects .",
    "therefore , we can write the interval , using a weak field approximation [ 6 ] : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , @xmath10 is the velocity of light , @xmath11 is the earth mass , @xmath12 is the distance between center of the earth and center of mass of a hydrogen atom ( i.e. , a proton ) .",
    "then , in the local proper spacetime coordinates , which in the first approximation in @xmath13 are @xmath14 the classical lagrangian and action of an electron have the following standard forms : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bare electron mass , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electron charge and velocity , respectively ; @xmath19 is a distance between electron and proton .",
    "it is possible to show that the lagrangian ( 4 ) can be rewritten in coordinates @xmath20 as @xmath21 which corresponds to the following hamiltonian : @xmath22",
    "the hamiltonian ( 6 ) can be quantized by substituting a momentum operator , @xmath23 , instead of canonical momentum , @xmath24 : @xmath25 where we introduce passive gravitational mass operator of an electron to be proportional to its weight operator in a weak gravitational field ( 2 ) , @xmath26 note that the hamiltonian ( 7),(8 ) contains the virial contribution ( i.e. , the last term ) to the mass operator and , therefore , does not commute with electron energy operator , taken in the absence of the field .",
    "below , we discuss some consequences of eqs.(7),(8 ) .",
    "suppose that we have a macroscopic ensemble of hydrogen atoms with each of them being in a ground state with energy @xmath27 .",
    "then the expectation value of the electron mass operator ( 8) per atom is @xmath28 where the third term in eq.(9 ) is zero in accordance with the quantum virial theorem [ 5 ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the equivalence between passive gravitational mass and energy survives at a macroscopic level for stationary quantum states . let us discuss how eqs.(7),(8 ) break the equivalence between passive gravitational mass and energy at a microscopic level . here",
    ", we illustrate the above mentioned inequivalence , using the following thought experiment .",
    "suppose that at @xmath29 we create a ground state wave function of a hydrogen atom , corresponding to the absence of gravitational field , @xmath30 in gravitational field ( 2 ) , wave function ( 10 ) is not anymore a ground state .",
    "it is possible to show that a general solution of the schrdinger equation , corresponding to the hamiltonian ( 7),(8 ) , can be written as @xmath31 \\exp[-i m_e c^2 ( 1+\\phi / c^2 ) t/\\hbar ]   \\exp[-i e_n(1+\\phi / c^2 ) t/\\hbar ] .\\ ] ] we wish to draw attention to the fact that wave function ( 11 ) is a series of eigenfunctions of passive gravitational mass operator ( 8) .",
    "@xmath32 is a normalized wave function of an electron in a hydrogen atom in the absence of gravitational field , corresponding to energy @xmath33 .    in accordance with quantum mechanics , probability that , at @xmath34 , an electron occupies excited state with energy @xmath35 is @xmath36",

    "in fact , this means that quantum measurement of passive gravitational mass in a quantum state with a definite energy ( 10 ) gives the following quantized values : @xmath40",
    "here , we describe a realistic experiment : we consider a hydrogen atom being in its ground state at @xmath29 , located at distance @xmath41 from the center of the earth and having the wave function : @xmath42 \\exp[-im_ec^2(1+\\phi'/c^2 ) t /\\hbar ] \\exp[-ie_1(1+\\phi'/c^2)t/\\hbar ] .\\ ] ] the atom is supported by in the earth s gravitational field and moving from the earth at constant velocity , @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the fine structure constant ) , by spacecraft or satellite .",
    "it is possible to show that the electron wave function and the time dependent perturbation for the hamiltonian ( 7)-(8 ) , in the coordinate system related to center of mass of the atom , can be expressed as @xmath45 \\exp[-im_ec^2(1+\\phi'/c^2 ) t /\\hbar ] \\nonumber\\\\ \\exp[-ie_n(1+\\phi'/c^2)t/\\hbar ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath46 we wish to draw attention that in a spacecraft ( satellite ) , which moves with constant velocity , gravitational force , which acts on each individual hydrogen atom , is compensated by some non - gravitational forces .",
    "this causes very small changes of a hydrogen atom energy levels and is not important for our calculations .",
    "therefore , the atoms do not feel directly gravitational acceleration , @xmath47 , but feel , instead , gravitational potential , @xmath48 .    it is important",
    "that , if excited levels of a hydrogen atom were strictly stationary , then probability to find the passive gravitational mass to be quantized with @xmath38 ( 14 ) would be @xmath49 ^ 2    \\",

    "it is important that , although the probabilities ( 18 ) are small , the number of photons , @xmath53 , emitted by macroscopic ensemble of the atoms , can be large .",
