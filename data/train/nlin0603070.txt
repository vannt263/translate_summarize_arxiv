    "scaling and related power laws are widely used in physics . in real situations , however , scaling holds only approximately . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding scaling power laws hold approximately as well . on the other hand , discovery of the extended self - similarity in turbulence @xcite,@xcite and in the critical phenomena ( see for a review @xcite,@xcite ) shows that universal laws similar to the scaling ones can go far beyond the scaling itself , both for velocity @xcite,@xcite and for different fields convected by turbulence @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the question is : does the extended self - similarity ( ess ) can be theoretically explored in the frames of general scaling ideas or one needs in a completely new frames to explain the ess ? in turbulence this problem is related to the problem of the so - called near - dissipation range .",
    "theoretical approach to description of the scaling ( the so - called inertial ) range of scales in turbulence requires that the space scales @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is ( kolmogorov ) dissipation or molecular viscous scale @xcite . on the other hand , the near - dissipation range of scales , for which @xmath3 has a more complex , presumably non - scaling dynamics ( see , for instance , refs.@xcite-@xcite and the references cited there ) . indeed ,",
    "for moderate reynolds numbers , the near - dissipation range can span most of the available range of scales @xcite .",
    "different perturbation theories , which start from scaling as a leading mode , can be developed .",
    "effectiveness of such theories is usually checked by comparison with experiments . in the present paper",
    "we will explore a generic analytic expansion of scaling in direction of the dissipation scale @xmath1 .",
    "effectiveness of the suggested perturbation theory has been shown for the turbulent flows with moderate reynolds numbers .",
    "interplay between local and non - local regimes has been considered as a possible hydrodynamic mechanism providing the basis for the degenerate scaling of structure functions and extended self - similarity in turbulent flows .",
    "let us consider a dimensional function @xmath5 of a dimensional argument @xmath6 . and",
    "let us construct a _ dimensionless _ function of the same argument @xmath7 if for @xmath8 we have no relevant fixed scale ( scaling situation ) , then for these values of @xmath6 the function @xmath9 must be independent on @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "solution of equation ( 1 ) with constant @xmath12 can be readily found as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a dimension constant .",
    "this is the well - known power law corresponding to the scaling situations .",
    "let us now consider an analytic theory , which allows us to find generic corrections of all orders to the approximate power law , related to the fixed small scale @xmath1 . in the non - scaling situation",

    "corrections of the higher orders can be readily found in this perturbation theory",
    ".    for degenerate case with @xmath25 the second term in the expansion ( 5 ) becomes the leading term @xmath26^{\\alpha_1 }   \\eqno{(7)}\\ ] ] it was already mentioned that there are many different ways to develop perturbation theory to scaling .",
    "the idea that just @xmath27 is an appropriate parameter for the finite - size corrections to scaling in turbulence was suggested in @xcite . on a physical level",
    "this was related in @xcite to the instabilities of the thin vortex tubes ( or filaments ) , which are the most prominent hydrodynamical elements of turbulent flows .",
    "these instabilities usually appear as kinks readily transforming into wave packets propagating along the filaments .",
    "one can consider such wave packet with scale @xmath6 and make use of the  localized induction \" approximation to the biot - savart formula @xcite . in this approximation , contributions of portions at distances greater than @xmath28 to the velocity fluctuation in the immediate vicinity of",
    "any given point on the filament are neglected .",
    "the vortex core radius , which usually associated with @xmath1 , provides a cutoff from below .",
    "the vortex filament dynamics in this approximation is described by the equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the position vector of a point on the filament , @xmath31 is the vortex strength , @xmath32 is the local curvature , and @xmath33 is the unit binormal vector of the filament .",
    "one can see that in this approximation the dependence on @xmath6 is completely determined by the logarithmic term @xmath27 in the dynamic equation .",
    "this pure hydrodynamic consideration was suggested in @xcite as a basis for using just @xmath27 in finite - size corrections to scaling in turbulence ( see also section iv below ) .",
    "the longitudinal structure function of order @xmath34 for the velocity field @xcite @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) calculated for @xmath37 , using the data obtained in a wind tunnel at @xmath38 and 487 @xcite , is shown in fig .  1 .",

    "the solid curve in this figure also corresponds to the best fit by equation ( 7 ) .",
    "as far as we know eq .",

    "application of these results to correlation functions @xcite is in good agreement with the structure functions analysis ( cf .",

    "figure 4 shows the structure functions of different orders @xmath34 for the wind - tunnel data ( @xmath43 and the degenerate scaling ( 7 ) is shown in the figure as the solid curves .",
    "one can see that the degenerate scaling requires two fitting constants just as the ordinary scaling does , and , in the examples discussed above , the range of scales covered by the degenerate scaling is about two decades .",
    "in order to understand a possible hydrodynamic mechanism of the phenomenon described above let us recall that in isotropic turbulence a complete separation of local and non - local interactions is possible in principle .",
    "it was shown by kadomtsev @xcite that this separation plays a crucial role for the local kolmogorov s cascade regime with scaling energy spectrum @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the average of the energy dissipation rate , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the wave - number .",
    "this separation should be effective for the both ends .",
    "that is , if there exists a solution with the local scaling ( 9 ) as an asymptote , then there should also exist a solution with the non - local scaling asymptote .",
    "of course , the two solutions with these asymptotes should be alternatively stable ( unstable ) in different regions of scales .",
    "it is expected , that the local ( kolmogorov s ) solution is stable ( i.e. statistically dominating ) in inertial range ( that means instability of the non - local solution in this range of scales ) .    roughly speaking , in non - local solution for small scales @xmath6 only non - local interactions with large scales @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are dynamically significant and the non - local interactions is determined by large scale strain / shear .",
    "this means that one should add to the energy flux @xmath45-parameter ( which is a governing parameter for the both solutions ) an additional parameter such as the strain @xmath50 for the non - local solution .",
    "as far as we know it was noted for the first time by nazarenko and laval @xcite that dimensional considerations applied to the non - local asymptotic result in the power - law energy spectrum @xmath51 both for two- and three - dimensional cases .",
    "linear dependence of the spectrum ( 10 ) on @xmath45 is determined by the linear nature of equations corresponding to the non - local asymptotic that together with the dimensional considerations results in ( 10 ) @xcite .",
    "interesting numerical simulations were performed in @xcite . in these simulations",
    "local and non - local interactions have been alternatively removed .",
    "for the first case a tendency toward a spectrum flatter than -5/3 is observed near and beyond the separating scale ( beyond which local interactions are ignored ) , that supports eq .",

    "this can result in viscous stabilization of the non - local regime ( cf @xcite ) and , as a consequence , in the so - called exchange of stability phenomenon at certain @xmath58 .",
    "that is , for @xmath59 the kolmogorov s regime is stable and the non - local regime is unstable , whereas for @xmath60 the kolmogorov s regime is unstable and the non - local regime is stable . for this scenario , at @xmath61 the kolmogorov s regime is still asymptotically scale - invariant ( i.e. eq .  ( 9 ) gives an adequate approximation for this regime ) , while for the non - local regime the first order correction is substantial ( i.e. eq .  ( 12 ) should be used at @xmath61 for the non - local regime ) . in this scenario",
    "the kolmogorov s regime plays significant role in the viscous stabilization of the non - local regime for @xmath60 ( cf @xcite ) , but for these @xmath57 the non - local regime becomes statistically dominating instead of the kolmogorov s one .",

    "while in the near - dissipation range we observe the degenerate scaling an ordinary scaling ( presumably kolmogorov s one ) has been certainly observed in the inertial range of scales for very large reynolds numbers ( see , for instance , @xcite,@xcite ) .",

    "this condition , in particular , gives a power - law relation between moments of different orders @xmath85 with the same exponent @xmath86 for both inertial and near - dissipation ranges ( see eq .",
    "the last phenomenon was previously observed in different turbulent flows and was called extended self - similarity ( ess ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is important to note that at ess not only the scalings ( 23 ) are the same in both regimes inertial and dissipative , but also the prefactors are the same .",
    "figure 6 shows as circles the exponents @xmath87 obtained from figs .",
    "1,4 and normalized by the exponent @xmath88 . for comparison",
    "we show by crosses in this figure the normalized exponents obtained using ess in the atmospheric turbulence for large @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a high - resolution numerical simulation reported in a recent paper @xcite for _ low - reynolds - number _ ( @xmath90 ) flows shows no hint of scaling - like behavior of the velocity increments even when ess is applied .",
    "that should return us to the section ii and recall us that the degenerate scaling in the form of eq .",
    "( 7 ) is only a _ first _ non - trivial term in the perturbation theory . moreover , the question of convergence of the perturbation theory used in section ii become significant at the _ low - reynolds - number _ , when the dissipation scale is effectively too close to the scales under consideration .",
    "though , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claim that : the dns scaling exponents of velocity gradients agree well with those deduced , using a recent theory of anomalous scaling , from the scaling exponents of the longitudinal structure functions at infinitely high reynolds numbers .",
    "this suggests that the asymptotic state of turbulence is attained for the velocity gradients at far lower reynolds numbers than those required for the inertial range to appear. this circle of problems can be also related to the possibility of fluctuations of the dissipation scale @xcite,@xcite . for the cases when these fluctuations are significant a set of the expansions",
    "might be needed or ( alternatively , for moderate reynolds numbers ) calculation should involve averaging over the fluctuating cut - off @xmath1 . in the last case",
    "the experimental and numerical data suggest that the average value of @xmath1 should not deviate strongly from the kolmogorov dissipation scale ( at least for the moderate values of reynolds number ) .",
    "though , the problem with the small reynolds numbers can be deeper .",
    "we do not know whether the non - local regime appears at the same reynolds number as the local one .",
    "the energy balance of the non - local regime is more complex than that of the local one .",
    "actually the non - local regime needs in the local one ( even statistically unstable ) for this balance ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , _",
    "critical _ reynolds number for appearance of the ( stable ) non - local regime can be larger than that for the local regime .",
    "figures 2 and 5 show that for sufficiently large reynolds numbers , providing a visible inertial interval , there is an overlapping between the two scalings : non - local and local ( kolmogorov ) .",
    "this overlapping is based on the very nature of the stability exchange between the two _ statistical _ regimes .",
    "therefore , it is not a simple task to determine the scale @xmath77 from the @xmath91-data .",
    "a more fine information one can infer studying @xmath92 ( cf eq.(8 ) and see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . unlike @xmath93 most positive contributions are canceled by negative ones in @xmath94 , and only the slight asymmetry of the @xmath95 probability density contributes to @xmath94 .",

    "<S> is shown shown that a degenerate case with @xmath2 can describe turbulence statistics in the near - dissipation range @xmath3 , where the ordinary ( power - law ) scaling does not apply . for moderate reynolds numbers the degenerate scaling range covers almost the entire range of scales of velocity structure functions ( the log - corrections apply to finite reynolds number ) . </S>",
    "<S> interplay between local and non - local regimes has been considered as a possible hydrodynamic mechanism providing the basis for the degenerate scaling of structure functions and extended self - similarity . </S>",
    "<S> these results have been also expanded on passive scalar mixing in turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> overlapping phenomenon between local and non - local regimes and a relation between position of maximum of the generalized energy input rate and the actual crossover scale between these regimes are briefly discussed . </S>"
