    "the widely considered models of accretion disks have gas rotating in one direction with a turbulent viscosity acting to transport angular momentum outward ( @xcite ) . however , recent observations point to more complicated disk structures in both active galactic nuclei and on a galactic scale . warped and tilted nuclear accretion disks",
    "have been detected for example in ngc 4753 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent high spectral resolution studies of normal galaxies has revealed counter rotating gas ( @xcite ) and/or stars in many galaxies of all morphological types - ellipticals , spirals , and irregulars ( see reviews by rubin 1994 and galletta 1996 ) .",
    "ngc 4826 ( @xcite ) and ic 1459 ( @xcite ) are examples of galaxies with central counter - rotating gas and stellar disks , respectively . in elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the counter - rotating component is usually in the nuclear core and may result from merging of galaxies with opposite angular momentum .",
    "newly supplied gas with misaligned angular momentum in the nuclear region of a galaxy may have important consequences for nuclear activity if there is a rotating massive black hole at the galaxy s center ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , in a number of spirals and s0 galaxies , counter - rotating disks of stars and/or gas have been found to co - exist with the primary disk out to large distances ( @xmath3 kpc ) , with the first example , ngc 4550 , discovered by rubin , graham , and kenney ( 1992 ) .",
    "it is not likely that the large scale counter - rotating disks result from mergers of flat galaxies with opposite angular momenta because of the large vertical thickening observed in simulation studies of such mergers ( @xcite ) .",
    "thakar and ryden ( 1996 ) discuss different possibilities , ( a ) that the counter - rotating matter comes from the merger of an oppositely rotating gas rich dwarf galaxy with an existing spiral , and ( b ) that the accretion of gas occurs over the lifetime of the galaxy with the more recently accreted gas counter - rotating .",
    "subsequent star formation in the counter - rotating gas may then lead to counter - rotating stars .",
    "the two - stream instability between counter - rotating gas and co - rotating stars may enhance the rate of gas accretion ( @xcite ) .",
    "an important open problem is how counter - rotating gas disks form and what their structures are on galactic scales and on the scale of disks in active galactic nuclei . here",

    "it might at first be supposed that powerful kelvin - helmholtz instabilities heat the gas to escape speed and rapidly destroy the assumed configuration .",
    "however , supersonic shear layers exist and exhibit gross stability in stellar and extra - galactic jets ( @xcite ) . in the counter - rotating disk ,",
    "matter approaching the equatorial plane from above and below has angular momenta of opposite signs with the result that there is angular momentum annihilation at @xmath8 , the matter loses its centrifugal support and accretes at essentially free - fall speed . on the other hand , accretion disks rotating in one direction",
    "are modeled assuming a turbulent viscosity which is crucial for the outward transport of angular momentum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the counter - rotating disks can also be expected to be turbulent owing in part to the kelvin - helmholtz instability , and turbulent viscosity can transport angular momentum outward in the large @xmath9 regions of the disk .",
