    "in our earlier paper @xcite we investigated bloore s collisional partial differential equation ( pde ) @xcite describing the evolution of particle shapes under isotropic collisions : [ bloore ] -v=",
    "a(1 + 2bh + ck ) where @xmath0 is the evolution speed in the direction of the inward normal , @xmath1 with the dimension of speed , @xmath2 is the mean curvature and @xmath3 is the gauss curvature and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants with the dimensions of length and @xmath6 respectively . in @xcite we approximated ( [ bloore ] ) by a set of ordinary differential equations called the box equations under the assumption that all shapes are ellipsoidal and remain so for all times , i.e. it is sufficient to track the evolution of the orthogonal bounding boxes .",
    "the box model was successfully tested against laboratory experiments and recently against a detailed field study along the williams river , australia @xcite .    in the current paper",
    "we extend and generalise our previous work .",
    "the original bloore equation ( [ bloore ] ) and its box approximations correctly describe the evolution of geometrical shapes , however , these are purely geometrical equations and thus unable to predict the correct time evolution for mass and volume",
    ". one important sign of this shortcoming is that the model ( [ bloore ] ) predicts finite lifetimes for all particles whereas field observations in fluvial environments indicate an exponential decay as formulated by sternberg s empirical formula , also called sternberg s law @xcite .",
    "this indicates that volume evolution has to be derived from physical equations independent of the bloore model .",
    "although physically incorrect , the bloore model ( and its box approximations ) still predict volume evolution rates depending on the normal speed @xmath0 from ( [ bloore ] ) and on the geometry of the surface @xmath7 : [ geom ] v^g(v ) = _ vda . where the superscript @xmath8 refers to the geometrical equations and @xmath9 denotes differentiation with respect to time .",
    "these rates we call _ the geometrical volume evolution and we derive the exact formulae in section [ s : volgeom ] . as we can see in ( [ geom ] ) , @xmath10 is a linear function of the normal speed @xmath0 in ( [ bloore ] ) , i.e. [ linear1 ] v^g(v)=v^g .",
    "subsequently , in section [ s : volumeweight ] in the spirit of firey s work @xcite we introduce the _ volume weight functions @xmath11 which depend only on time and do not depend on the location on the surface .",
    "these functions enter bloore s equation instead of the constant @xmath12 and we also define their analogues in the box equations . if we have an independent physical model for volume evolution predicting volume diminution rate @xmath13 ( the superscript referring to the independent physical equations ) then we can set this equal to the volume diminution predicted by the volume - weighted geometrical equations v^g(f(v)v)=v^p and this condition yields , via the linear property ( [ linear1 ] ) f(v)=. this illustrates that volume weight functions can be used to suppress the geometrical volume evolution rates entirely in favour of the physical ones . after introducing in section [ s : collective ] the basic equations for the statistical theory of collective abrasion , in section [ s : phys ] we introduce some models which predict physical volume diminution in accordance with sternberg s law , so combining these models with the original geometrical equations via the volume weight functions yields shape and size evolution consistent both with the geometrical bloore theory as well as sternberg s empirical formula for volume diminution . _ _    in addition to introducing the volume weight functions and the physical volume evolution into the geometrical model , we also generalise the original bloore model in other ways . in section [",
    "s : mutual ] we introduce the coupled system of pdes describing the mutual abrasion of two particles , as well as the box approximations of these equations .",
    "all previously mentioned equations deal with collisional abrasion which , as we pointed out in @xcite is not capable on its own to adequately describe the collective evolution of pebbles in geological environments . in section [",
    "s : friction ] we introduce the pde including friction and also its box approximations . in section [ s : phys ]",
    "we also provide the physical volume evolution model for the frictional case .",
    "frictional abrasion is particularly significant , because in @xcite we showed that in the box flows if identical shapes mutually abrade each other ( which we call the self - dual flow ) then friction may stabilise nontrivial shapes as global attractors . however , it was not clear whether these shapes are also attractive in size , i.e. whether the self - dual flows are stable with respect to perturbations in size .",
    "earlier we pointed out that global transport resulting in size segregation may stabilise these flows .",
    "while that is certainly a valid possibility , in section [ s : stab ] we show that a potentially more relevant mechanism is defined by the physical models of volume diminution . in the models introduced in our current paper",
    "we show the exact condition under which a physical volume diminution model can stabilise the self - dual flows .    beyond isotropic particle abrasion",
    "we also discuss unidirectional abrasion and in appendix [ s : wein ] we show that under such conditions linear weingarten surfaces emerge as translationally invariant solutions of the unidirectional bloore equation .    the current version of the manuscript is intended to convey both the theoretical pde models based on bloore s equation as well as to provide detailed basis for a computer code simulating collective abrasion based on the box equations .",
    "the latter could serve as a platform to compare these results with field data and laboratory data .",
    "due to this double goal , readers interested in any one of the above subjects may find some equations which appear less relevant to their immediate purpose . on the other hand , separation of the two subjects also raises difficulties and at this stage we decided to keep the material at least temporarily unified .",
    "in @xcite bloore proposed that the shape of the bounding surface @xmath7 of pebbles made of a homogeneous material and eroded by a gas of small spherical abraders should be governed by a local equation of the form -v= f(_1,_2 ) [ urbloore ] , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the principal radii of curvatures , @xmath0 is the speed along the inward normal at which the local area element @xmath16 is being eroded and @xmath17 is some symmetric function of the principal curvatures @xmath18 .",
    "the simplest case is perhaps ( [ bloore ] ) , mentioned in the introduction . for spherical abraders of radius @xmath19",
    ", bloore gave a statistical argument that b = r , c = r^2 .",
    "for non - spherical abraders , a more sophisticated treatment using schneider - weil theory @xcite leads to [ coeffs ] b= , c= , where m= _ h da , a = _ da are the integrated mean curvature and area respectively .",
    "thus one expects on purely dimensional grounds that the first term to be important for pebbles whose linear size is large compared with the size of the abraders while for pebbles whose linear size is comparable with the size of the abraders the second and third terms should be increasingly important .",
    "evidently , when the size of the pebble is comparable with the size of the abraders , the _ single pebble _ treatment like bloore s breaks down and the evolution of the abraders must also be considered .    in the mathematics literature the three terms in ( [ bloore ] )",
    "are often treated separately . the first term in ( [ bloore ] )",
    "-v= a [ eikonal ] is called the _ eikonal equation _ or the _ parallel map _ and arises in the study of wave fronts with speed @xmath12 , satisfying huygens s principle . given an initial aspherical surface the eikonal flow tends to make the surface more aspherical and to develop faces which intersect on edges @xcite .    the second term in ( [ bloore ] ) -v= 2abh [ mean ]",
    "is called the _",
    "mean curvature flow _ @xcite and often arises in problems where surface tension is important @xcite .",
    "given an initial aspherical surface it tends to make the surface more spherical @xcite .    the third term in ( [ bloore ] ) -v=",
    "ac k [ gauss ] is called the _ gauss flow _ and it also tends to make the surface more spherical @xcite .    for completeness",
    "we mention a fourth flow which is sometimes studied for its special mathematical properties @xcite which we call the _ rayleigh _ flow [ rayleigh ] -v= constant k^ .",
    "the reason for our name is that this flow has the property , first noticed by lord rayleigh @xcite that under it , ellipsoids evolve in a self - similar fashion .      if we describe the moving shape @xmath7 as the level sets t+ ( x , y , z ) = 0 , we may transcribe a bloore type equation for the moving surface @xmath7 as a pde for @xmath20 as follows . in one time",

    "thus we have 1 + = 0 .",
    "but the velocity @xmath0 in the normal direction is v= thus 1 + || v = 0 . where @xmath22 and @xmath18 may be expressed in terms of @xmath23 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular h & = & + k&= & + g&= & _ x^2 ( _ yy _ zz- _ yz^2 ) + _ y^2",

    "if @xmath7 is a single - valued function in @xmath24 then we may represent it as a graph over a plane z - h(x , y , t)=0 .",
    "since the normal is @xmath25 we obtain the bloore equation as a pde in @xmath26 = v [ monge ] .the standard expressions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 may be obtained by substituting @xmath29 in ( [ gausscurvature ] ) .",

    ", interfaces are often modelled using the the _ kardar - parisi - zhang equation _ for the height function @xmath32    = ^2 h + 2 ( h ) ^2 + ( x , y , t ) [ kpz ] where @xmath33 is with respect to the _ flat _ metric on @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a langevin - type stochastic gaussian noise term @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that this was not re - parametrisation invariant and is an approximation to a stochastic version of the _ mean curvature flow_. v= -h + + ( ^a , t ) the first term is essentially the functional derivative of surface energy , i.e. a _ surface tension term _ and the second is the functional derivative of a volume energy i.e. a _ pressure _ term . in the absence of the stochastic noise ,",
    "i.e. if @xmath36 and if @xmath37 , the system should relax to a surface of constant mean curvature @xmath38 . for pebbles",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 and the pressure is negative . in the absence of the noise term , the kpz equation ( [ kpz ] ) may , by means of the substitution @xmath41 , reduced to the linear diffusion equation for @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the bloore equations are partial differential equations and define a flow on the infinite space of shapes . in @xcite",
    "a finite dimensional truncation was introduced which leads to a finite number of ordinary differential equations referred to as the _ box equations_. the basic idea is to bound our pebble by rectangular box of sides @xmath43 ordered such that @xmath44 which defines an inscribed ellipsoid of semi - axes @xmath45 .",
    "one then writes down three equations -u_i= f(_1_i,_2_i ) where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are now taken to be the curvatures of the inscribed ellipsoid at the ends of the three principal axes @xmath48 , @xmath49,@xmath50 .",
    "thus ( [ bloore ] ) takes the form -u_1 = a ( 1 + b ( + ) + c ) , [ boxeqn ] where @xmath51 denotes two further equations obtained by cyclic permutation of the suffices @xmath52 .",
    "in @xcite it was found convenient to replace the three lengths @xmath45 by two dimensionless ratios and a length @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , yielding [ yy_box3d ] y_i & = & af_i(y_1,y_2,y_3,b , c ) = a ( + 2 b + c ) + [ y3_box3d ] -y_3 & = & af_3(y_1,y_2,y_3,b , c)= a(1 + + ) , where [ components ] f_i^e= y_i-1 , f_i^m = f_i^g= , i , j=1,2 ; i = j . by introducing the vector notation @xmath56^t , \\mathbf{f}=[f_1,f_2,f_3]^t$ ] , ( [ yy_box3d])-([y3_box3d ] ) can be rewritten as [ i_individual_box3d ] = a(,b , c ) , which is identical to equations ( 2.2)-(2.6 ) of @xcite .",
    "a special case of the box equations are the _ spherical flows _ for which @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the radius of the sphere .",
    "the spherical flows obtained from the box equations in fact coincide with the exact solutions of the full partial differential equations ( [ bloore ] ) obtained by assuming that @xmath7 is a sphere .",
    "in the bloore equations the abraders are assumed to be constant in shape and size .",
    "it is , however , simple to write down a set of evolution equations for both the abraders and the abraded pebbles as done in @xcite for the simplified case , the box equations .",
    "in that case we introduced semi - box - lengths @xmath59 for the abrading particles , yielding two dimensionless ratios and one length @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . retaining the notation of @xcite we use the labels @xmath63 and @xmath64 for abraded and abraded , by utilising ( [ coeffs ] ) , the obvious partial differential equations to consider are [ binarybloore1 ] -v_y&= & a(1 + 2 h_y + k_y ) + [ binarybloore2 ] -v_z&= & a(1 + 2 h_z + k_z ) .      in the box approximation the mean curvature and surface area integrals in ( [ coeffs ] ) are replaced by the corresponding quantities of the orthogonal bounding box of the the incoming particle ( which , for simplicity is now taken as the @xmath65 particle ) : [ integ ] m = 2z_3(z_1+z_2 + 1 ) , a = 8z_3 ^ 2(z_1z_2+z_1+z_2 ) .",

    "as written , the equations ( [ binarybloore1])-([binarybloore2 ] ) have a solution for which the abraders and abraded have identical forms .",
    "this solution we refer to as the _ self - dual flow_. for the self - dual flow the labels @xmath63 and @xmath64 are redundant and we are left with the single equation -v= a(1",
    "+ 2 h + k ) [ selfdual ] which in the box approximation reads [ selfdual_box ] = a ( , b(),c())= a^c ( , ) . an important question is whether the self dual flow ( [ selfdual ] ) or its box version ( [ selfdual_box ] ) are stable within the class of binary bloore flows ( [ binarybloore1])-([binarybloore2 ] ) and binary box flows ( [ y_box3d])-([z_box3d ] ) , respectively .      if both particles are spherical ( with radii @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively ) , then both the binary bloore equations ( [ binarybloore1])-([binarybloore2 ] ) and the binary box equations ( [ y_box3d])-([z_box3d ] ) collapse to the same two coupled first order ordinary differential equations : [ sphere1 ] -r_y&= & a(1 + 2 + ( ) ^2 ) + [ sphere2 ] -r_z&= & a(1 + 2 + ( ) ^2 ) .",
    "in @xcite the effects of mutual friction , both rolling and sliding were incorporated into the box equations .",
    "this can be done at the level of the equations describing the the complete evolution of the pebble but while the equations remain first order in time they become rather non - local in the coordinates @xmath69 used to parametrise the embedding = ( u , v , t ) of the surface @xmath7 into euclidean space .    we define @xmath70 to be the distance of the point @xmath71 from the instantaneous centroid @xmath72 of the pebble .",
    "we also define @xmath73 and @xmath74 as the instantaneous maximum and minimum of values of @xmath75 over the surface and we postulate that frictional abrasion is governed by [ friction1 ] ( u , v , t ) t =- g(r , r_min , r_max ) ( u , v , t),g>0 . in @xcite several constraints on the general form of of the function",
    "@xmath76 were given and also one example satisfying these constraints was demonstrated , introducing separate terms for sliding and rolling with independent coefficients @xmath77 , respectively and the dimensionless ratios @xmath78 : [ friction10 ] g(r , r_min , r_max)=_sf_s(r_1,r_2)+_rf_r(r_1,r_2)=_sr_2r_1 ^ -n+_rr_2(1-r_2^n ) . according to the arguments discussed in @xcite , for sufficiently high values of @xmath79 , this model appears to capture most essential physical features of frictional abrasion . while ( [ friction10 ] ) is clearly just an example ( @xcite describes also an alternative equation ) , however , it provides a simple basis for a qualitative analysis .",

    "[ volumeflow ] it is immediately apparent that if @xmath103 is symmetric , i.e. f(v_z , v_y)= f(v_z , v_z ) then we have = 1 , that is the trajectories are straight lines in the @xmath86 plane making an angle of @xmath105 with the axes . by using @xmath106 and @xmath107 ,",
    "these can be transferred to the @xmath108 $ ] plane where straight lines become curves which in the downward direction move away from the straight line @xmath109 .",
    "it follows that if the volume weight function @xmath102 is symmetrical then the self - dual trajectory defined by @xmath110 is unstable within the class of spherical flows . beyond showing that asymmetry is a necessary condition for the stability for the self - dual flows ,",
    "we also show a simple example where it is also sufficient .",
    "if we assume that [ asym1 ] f(v_y , v_z ) = ( ) ^p then we have = = ( ) ^2(3p-1 ) . [ slope ]",

    "thus if @xmath114 the self - dual flow is unstable and if @xmath115 it will be stable .    as pointed out in @xcite",

    "here we would like to point out that in case of volume - weighted spherical flows , friction also contributes to the relative stabilisation of size in the sense that the particle s linear size converges to each other .",
    "since we treat friction as an individual abrasion , any monotonically increasing volume weight function @xmath117 associated with friction produces an asymmetry which has an analogous effect to the above - discussed asymmetry of the volume weight function for collisional abrasion .    in the next section",
    "we show that asymmetric models ( although more complex than ( [ asym1 ] ) ) emerge naturally from physical considerations .",
    "we will only prove the stabilising property of the physical volume weight functions for the spherical case , however , they appear to have the same effect for general geometries .",

    "as we can see , @xmath205 shows a marked decrease along the river thus indicating the stability of the @xmath199 solution .",

    "bloore originally proposed @xcite his equation to describe the evolution of the surface of a pebble under _ isotropic _ bombardment by abraders . in the case of bedrock evolution for example , the abraders are _ unidirectional _ and a modification of his equation is required .",
    "the simplest modification is the insertion of an inclination factor @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the angle between the direction of the abraders and the normal of the abraded surface@xcite .",
    "this amounts to replacing @xmath0 by @xmath208 in the previous equations . in a previous paper @xcite we showed how circular profiles evolving with constant speed @xmath132 , sometimes called _",
    "translators _ emerge as stable final states of the cylindrically symmetric ( or planar ) form of the unidirectional bloore equation .",
    "this agreed with existing theoretical and experimental work described in @xcite .    in this section",
    "we shall extend our earlier result to the full three - dimensional case .",
    "we find that the possible final states are in general weingarten surfaces , that is @xcite surfaces for which there is a functional relation between the two principal curvatures @xmath209 and @xmath210 . in the special case ( [ bloore ] )",
    "the possible final states belong to a special class of weingarten surfaces ( sometimes called _ linear _ ) , whose mean curvature @xmath27 , and gauss curvature @xmath28 satisfy the linear relation f(1 + 2b h + c k ) = u , [ line ] where , @xmath211 are constants characterising the abraders , and @xmath132 is the constant final speed .",
    "a possible test of the theory would be examine the distribution of mean and gauss curvature on an abraded rock face as a function of time .",
    "if governed by the unidirectional bloore equation this distribution , when plotted in the @xmath212 plane should concentrate on the straight line ( [ line ] )      we choose , for concreteness , to work with the monge representation in which the original bloore equation is ( [ monge ] ) , but our result does not depend on that choice .",
    "the cosine @xmath213 between the normal and the positive @xmath64 direction is given by = .",
    "replacing @xmath0 by @xmath214 in ( [ monge ] ) gives h = v(_1 , _ 2 ) if @xmath132 is the constant speed , we have h = ut+ z(x , y ) , and therefore u = v(_1 , _ 2 ) , which shows that the translator must be weingarten surface . in the special case ( [ bloore ] ) we obtain ( [ line ] ) .    a simple example of a travelling front or translator solution is a sphere h(x , y , t ) = ut + , u= f(1 + + ) if @xmath215 we obtain _ surfaces of constant mean curvature _",
    "the case @xmath216 gives r_1 + r_2 = - if @xmath217 then fc = u - f which are surfaces of constant curvature . if @xmath218 then if @xmath219 the linear weingarten surface is called _ elliptic _ , if @xmath220 it is called _ hyperbolic _ and if @xmath221 it is called _ tubular_. in particular , a surface of constant negative curvature is hyperbolic , while surfaces of constant positive curvature are elliptic , as are surfaces of constant mean curvature .",
    "an example @xcite of a hyperbolic surface of revolution given by ( x , y , z ) = ( ( u ) , ( u ) , z(u ) ) with ( u ) = u - u , z(u)= u + u + ( ) which satisfies h+k+=0 .",
    "we study particle shape evolution under collisional abrasion , governed by bloore s partial differential equation ( [ bloore ] ) and we are concerned about qualitative and quantitative features of the evolution of the _ observable quantities _ such as linear size ( maximal width ) , surface area and volume ( denoted by @xmath222 , respectively ) associated with convex solids in collisional abrasion governed by bloore s partial differential equation ( [ bloore ] ) .",
    "we refer to the three terms as the eikonal , mean curvature and gaussian term , respectively .    in ( [ bloore ] ) ,",
    "if coefficients @xmath223 are constant then all observable quantities have finite lifetimes .",
    "if only one component of ( [ bloore ] ) is acting then we have : [ eikonal ] & d & = -1 , + [ mean ] & a & = -2b(w+4 ) , + [ gauss ] & v & = -4c . where @xmath9 refers to differentiation with respect to time @xmath129 and @xmath224 is the wilmore functional given by [ wilmore ] w= _ ( - ) ^2 da 0 where @xmath225 are the principal radii .",
    "in case of the box equations ( [ y_box3d])-([z_box3d ] ) we have the analogous observable quantities @xmath226 , all given as functions of the dimensionless box ratios @xmath227 multiplied by some power of @xmath228 : [ dbox ] d_box & = & 2y_3 + [ abox ] a_box & = & 8y_3 ^ 2(y_1y_2+y_1+y_2 ) + [ vbox ] v_box & = & 8y_3 ^ 3y_1y_2 in case of the eikonal , mean curvature and gaussian flows we have [ eikonalbox ] & : & y_3 = -2 + [ meanbox ] & : & y_3 = - ( ) + [ gaussbox ] & : & y_3 = - so , based on ( [ dbox])-([gaussbox ] ) , the evolution speed for observable quantities is in all cases a product of an @xmath79-th power of @xmath228 and some function @xmath229 : [ o1 ] \\{observable}=y_3^nf(y_1,y_2 ) the resulting values for @xmath79 are summarised in table 1 where we also list in @xmath230 $ ] brackets the power of length in the evolved observable quantity and the geometric quantity generating the evolution .",
    "the detailed formulae for @xmath229 we derive in section [ sec : box1 ] .",

    "solid line represent exact result for the pde , dashed line represent qualitative curves under the assumption of self - similar evolution .",
    "we remark that the box equations yield the same results under these assumptions .",
    "we can observe _ finite time horizon _ in each case.,width=120 ]          if both curvature terms are zero then the box flows predict , similarly to the original pde , linear size diminution , i.e. we have [ box_eikonal_size ] d_box= 2y_3=-2 . unlike the original pde",
    ", here we get explicit equations for the area and volume diminution as well : [ box_eikonal_area_volume ] a_box & = & -16y_3(y_1+y_2 + 1 ) + v_box & = & -8y_3 ^ 2(y_1y_2+y_1+y_2)=-a_box showing that both area and volume diminution is slowing down with time , however , from ( [ box_eikonal_size ] ) it is clear that the particle has a finite time horizon .",
    "if we compare this to the pde , we can observe that in case of volume evolution the continuous equations remain valid for polyhedra , however , this is not the case for area evolution .",
    "the naive explanation is that in case of volume evolution the role of the non - smooth parts ( edges , vertices s ) is negligible , the bulk of volume loss is occurring over the smooth ( planar ) faces and on those parts the smooth equation is valid . in case of surface area",
    "this argument is not true : under the eikonal action , polyhedral surface is eliminated at the edges and therefore the non - smooth effects can not be neglected .",
    "[ box_mean_size ] d_box & = & 2y_3 = - ( + ) + [ box_mean_area ] a_box & = & -4b + v_box & = & -4by_3 ( ) so , we see that by assuming constant box ratios @xmath227 linear maximal size is diminishing at an accelerating rate . similarly to the pde ,",
    "the evolution speed of the surface area is independent of maximal size , however , it is not a constant but it is approaching a negative constant as the box ratios approach 1 . in case of the volume , again assuming constant box ratios , we see an accelerating decrease .        [ box_gauss_size_area_volume ] d_box & = & - ( ) + a_box & = & - ( ) + [ box_gauss_volume ] v_box & = & -8c",
    "so we can see that , similar to the pde , volume evolution is independent of size .",
    "unlike in the pde , here the speed is not constant , however , it is approaching a negative constant as the shape evolves towards the sphere ."
