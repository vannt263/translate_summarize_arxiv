    ", the equilibrium magnetization of a ferrofluid is that of an ideal paramagnetic gas . in highly concentrated ferrofluids on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetization is influenced by effects of particle  particle interactions .",
    "we studied these effects for ferrofluids that are described by a system of identical dipolar hard spheres in @xcite , from now on referred to as paper  i. in that paper we used the technique of the born  mayer or cluster expansion technique to evaluate the equilibrium magnetization as a series expansion in terms of the volume fraction @xmath0 , and a dipolar coupling parameter @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the particle density , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the common hard sphere diameter and magnetic moment of the particles , respectively .",
    "however , real ferrofluids are polydisperse , i.  e.  the particles vary in size and magnetic moment .",
    "this property has a strong influence on the equilibrium magnetization , for concentrated as well as for dilute fluids .",
    "the goal of this paper is to generalize the findings of paper  i to include the effects of polydispersity .",
    "the linear response problem of determining the static initial susceptibility @xmath5 of a mixture of dipolar hard spheres was investigated already for the equivalent electric case in the framework of integral theories : the mean spherical model @xcite was extended to binary or multicomponent mixtures @xcite .",
    "the reference hypernetted chain method @xcite was also applied to bidisperse systems @xcite .",

    "our calculation follows closely that of paper  i. therein the application of the cluster expansion technique to a monodisperse system of dipolar hard spheres resulted in an expression for the magnetization @xmath6 that can be put into the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the saturation magnetization of the fluid .",

    "here we recapitulate briefly the principle of the born  mayer or cluster expansion technique : consider a system of particles @xmath20 interacting with an external potential @xmath21 and with each other via a potential @xmath22 . to calculate thermodynamic properties of the system one has to find the canonical partition function @xmath23 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 means integration over the configuration space .",

    "the leading terms factorize into low dimensional integrals that can be calculated at least numerically .    in the system of dipolar hard spheres (",
    "monodisperse or polydisperse ) the interaction potential @xmath22 consists of a dipole ",
    "dipole ( dd ) interaction and a hard core ( hc ) repulsion part , @xmath31 , where the first part is given by @xmath32 for two particles with magnetic moments @xmath33 and @xmath34 at a distance @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , and @xmath37",

    "requires some care because of the long range character of the forces @xcite .",
    "we circumvented this problem by decomposing the dipolar potentials into a short range and a long range part , and replacing the latter by an effective mean field . within this approach a particle experiences the local magnetic field @xmath43 it consists of the dipolar near field @xmath44 that is produced by the other particles within a sphere of radius @xmath45 and of an effective `` external '' field @xmath46 seen by the particle in question at the center of the sphere . here",
    "@xmath47 is the macroscopic internal magnetic field and @xmath48 the sought after equilibrium magnetization .",
    "thus , when evaluating the partition function one has to take @xmath49 as the external potential .",
    "the radius @xmath45 of the sphere has to be taken to be sufficiently large to allow the far - field dipolar contributions to be replaced by those of a continuum  cf .",
    "paper  i for details .",
    "neither the kinetic energy of the magnetic particles , nor the carrier fluid has to be taken into account in the partition function , since these terms do not contribute to the equilibrium magnetization . the configuration space is thus given by the positions @xmath50 of all particles and the orientations @xmath51 of their magnetic moments : @xmath52 .    in paper",
    "i we used in addition also an expansion in the dipolar interaction : the @xmath53terms were expanded as @xmath54 with @xmath55 the two expansions concerning the @xmath53terms and @xmath56 together translate in the monodisperse case into a double power expansion of @xmath57 in the the volume fraction @xmath14 of the particles and the dipolar coupling constant @xmath15 .",

    "in this paper we used the technique of cluster expansion to derive an approximation to the equilibrium magnetization for the system of dipolar hard spheres in a magnetic field with diameter and/or magnetic moment dispersion as a model system for a polydisperse ferrofluid .",
    "the calculation results in an expression for the magnetization @xmath6 in form of a twofold series expansion in the parameters @xmath16 , closely related to the volume fraction @xmath14 , and @xmath17 , a coupling parameter measuring the strength of the dipolar interaction : @xmath228 @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the dimensionless magnetic field @xmath18 are defined for some typical values @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the hard sphere diameters and magnetic moments respectively .",
    "@xmath67 can be chosen in such a way that the prefactor @xmath229 reduces to the saturation magnetization of the system .",
    "we gave expressions for @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) and @xmath232 .",

    "the influence of particle  particle interaction grows with increasing width of the considered diameter distribution .",
    "taking into account only the @xmath234term results in an increase of the magnetization relative to the non interacting system , whereas the @xmath232term leads again to somewhat smaller values at higher @xmath18 . only at very small @xmath18",

    "the @xmath230terms have little effect for realistic , magnetite  based ferrofluids , except for broad distributions , where they increase the initial magnetization .",
