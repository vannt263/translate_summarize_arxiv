    "for some time , the category of soergel bimodules , here called @xmath0 , has played a significant role in the study of representation theory , while more recently strong connections between @xmath0 and knot theory have come to light .",
    "originally introduced by soergel in @xcite , @xmath0 is an equivalent but more combinatorial description of a certain category of harish - chandra modules over a semisimple lie algebra @xmath1 .",
    "the added simplicity of this formulation comes from the fact that @xmath0 is just a full monoidal subcategory of graded @xmath2-bimodules , where @xmath2 is a polynomial ring equipped with an action of the weyl group of @xmath1 . among other things ,",
    "soergel gave an isomorphism between the grothendieck ring of @xmath0 and the hecke algebra @xmath3 associated to @xmath1 , where the kazhdan - lusztig generators @xmath4 of @xmath3 lift to bimodules @xmath5 which are easily described .",
    "the full subcategory generated monoidally by these bimodules @xmath5 is here called @xmath6 , and the category including all grading shifts and direct sums of objects in @xmath6 is called @xmath7 .",
    "it then turns out that @xmath0 is actually the idempotent closure of @xmath7 , which reduces the study of @xmath0 to the study of these elementary bimodules @xmath5 and their tensors . for more on soergel bimodules and their applications to representation theory see @xcite .",
    "an important application of soergel bimodules was discovered by rouquier in @xcite , where he observes that one can construct complexes in @xmath7 which satisfy the braid relations modulo homotopy . to the @xmath8 overcrossing ( resp .",
    "undercrossing ) in the braid group rouquier associates a complex , which has @xmath2 in homological degree 0 and @xmath5 in homological degree @xmath9 ( resp .",
    "@xmath10 ) . giving the homotopy equivalence classes of invertible complexes in @xmath7 the obvious group structure under tensor product",
    ", this assignment extends to a homomorphism from the braid group . using this",
    ", one can define an action of the braid group on the homotopy category of @xmath7 , where the endofunctor associated to a crossing is precisely taking the tensor product with its associated complex .",
    "following his work with l. rozansky on matrix factorizations and link homology in @xcite , khovanov produced an equivalent categorification @xcite of the homfly - pt polynomial utilizing rouquier s work . to a braid one",
    "associates its rouquier complex , which naturally has two gradings : the homological grading , and the internal grading of soergel bimodules .",
    "then , taking the hochschild homology of each term in the complex , one gets a complex which is triply graded ( the third grading is the hochschild homological grading ) .",
    "khovanov showed that , up to degree shifts , this construction yields an equivalent triply - graded complex to the one produced by the reduced version of the khovanov - rozansky homfly - pt link homology for the closure of the braid ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "many computations of homfly - pt link homology were done by b. webster @xcite , and by j. rasmussen in @xcite and @xcite . in the latter paper @xcite",
    ", rasmussen showed that given a braid presentation of a link , for every @xmath11 there exists a spectral sequence with @xmath12-term its homfly - pt homology and the @xmath13-term its @xmath14 homology .",
    "this was a spectacular development in understanding the structural properties of these theories , and has also proven very useful in computation ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one key aspect of the original khovanov - rozansky theory is that it gives rise to a projective functor .",
    "the braid group can actually be realized as the isomorphism classes of objects in the category of braid cobordisms .",
    "this category , while having a topological definition , is equivalent to a combinatorially defined category , whose objects are braid diagrams , and whose morphisms are called _ movies _ ( see carter - saito , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , performing a reidemeister 3 move on a braid diagram would give an equivalent element of the braid group , but gives a distinct object in the braid cobordism category ; however , the r3 move itself is a movie which gives the isomorphism between those two objects .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for each movie between braids one can associate a chain map between their triply - graded complexes .",
    "this assignment was known to be _ projectively functorial _ , meaning that the relations satisfied amongst movies in the braid cobordism category are also satisfied by their associated chain maps , up to multiplication by a scalar .",
    "scalars take their value in @xmath15 , the ring over which khovanov - rozansky theory is defined .",
    "however , these chain maps are not explicitly described even in the setting of khovanov - rozansky theory , and the maps they correspond to in the soergel bimodule context are even more obscure .",
    "a more general discussion of braid group actions , including this categorification via rouquier complexes , and their extensions to projective actions on the category of braid cobordisms can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite , the first author in conjunction with mikhail khovanov gave a presentation of the category @xmath6 in terms of generators and relations .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the entire category can be drawn graphically , thanks to the biadjointness and cyclicity properties that the category possesses .",
    "each @xmath5 is assigned a color , and a tensor product is assigned a sequence of colors .",
    "morphisms between tensor products can be drawn as certain colored graphs in the plane , whose boundaries on bottom and top are the sequence of colors associated to the source and target . composition and tensor product of morphisms correspond to vertical and horizontal concatenation , respectively .",
    "morphisms are invariant under isotopy of the graph embedding , and satisfy a number of other relations , as described herein .",
    "in addition to providing a presentation , this graphical description is useful because one can use pictures to encapsulate a large amount of information ; complicated calculations involving compositions of morphisms can be visualized intuitively and written down suffering only minor headaches .",
    "because of the simplicity of the diagrammatic calculus , we were able to calculate explicitly the chain maps which correspond to each generating cobordism in the braid cobordism category , and check that these chain maps satisfy the same relations that braid cobordisms do .",
    "the general proofs are straightforward and computationally explicit , performable by any reader with patience , time , and colored chalk . while we use some slightly more sophisticated machinery to avoid certain incredibly lengthy computations , the machinery is completely unnecessary .",
    "this makes the results of rouquier and khovanov that much more concrete , and implies the following new result .",
    "[ mainthm ] there is a functor @xmath16 from the category of combinatorial braid cobordisms to the category of complexes in @xmath7 up to homotopy , lifting rouquier s construction ( i.e. such that @xmath16 sends crossings to rouquier complexes ) .",
    "soergel bimodules are generally defined over certain fields @xmath17 in the literature , because one is usually interested in soergel bimodules as a categorification of the hecke algebra , and in relating indecomposable bimodules to the kazhdan - lusztig canonical basis .",
    "however , we invite the reader to notice that the diagrammatic construction in @xcite can be made over any ring , and in particular over @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , all our proofs of functoriality still work over @xmath18 .",
    "we discuss this in detail in section [ subsec - integers ] . in the subsequent paper ,",
    "we plan to use the work done here to define homfly - pt and @xmath14-link homology theories over @xmath18 , a construction which is long overdue .",
    "we also plan to investigate the rasmussen spectral sequence in this context .    at the given moment there does not exist a diagrammatic calculus for the higher hochschild homology of soergel bimodules .",
    "some insights have already been obtained , although a full understanding had yet to emerge .",
    "we plan to develop the complete picture , which should hopefully give an explicit and easily computable description of functoriality in the link homology theories discussed above .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec - constructions ]",
    "we go over all the previous constructions that are relevant to this paper .",
    "this includes the hecke algebra , soergel s categorification @xmath0 , the graphical presentation of @xmath0 , the combinatorial braid cobordism category , and rouquier s complexes which link @xmath0 to braids . in section [ subsec - conventions ]",
    "we describe the conventions we will use in the remainder of the paper to draw rouquier complexes for movies . in section [ sec - defn ]",
    "we define the functor from the combinatorial braid cobordism category to the homotopy category of @xmath0 , and in section [ sec - moviemoves ] we check the movie move relations to verify that our functor is well - defined .",
    "these checks are presented in numerical order , not in logical order , but a discussion of the logical dependency of the proofs , and of the simplifications that are used , can be found in section [ subsec - simplify ] .",
    "section [ sec - additional ] contains some useful statements for the interested reader , but is not strictly necessary .",
    "some additional light is shed on the generators and relations of @xmath0 in section [ subsec - brute ] , where it is demonstrated how the relations arise naturally from movie moves . in section [ subsec - integers ]",
    "we briefly describe how one might construct the theory over @xmath18 , so that future papers may use this result to define link homology theories over arbitrary rings .",

    ", soergel introduced a monoidal category categorifying the hecke algebra for a finite weyl group @xmath49 of type @xmath50 .",
    "we will denote this category by @xmath51 , or by @xmath0 when @xmath26 is irrelevant .",
    "letting @xmath52 be the geometric representation of @xmath49 over a field @xmath17 of characteristic @xmath53 , and @xmath2 its coordinate ring , the category @xmath0 is given as a full additive monoidal subcategory of graded @xmath2-bimodules ( whose objects are now commonly referred to as soergel bimodules ) .",
    "this category is not abelian , for it lacks images , kernels , and the like , but it is idempotent closed .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 is given as the idempotent closure of another full additive monoidal subcategory @xmath6 , whose objects are called bott - samuelson modules .",
    "the category @xmath6 is generated monoidally over @xmath2 by objects @xmath5 , @xmath25 , which satisfy    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    the grothendieck group of @xmath51 is isomorphic to @xmath45 , with the class of @xmath5 being sent to @xmath4 , and the class of @xmath57 being sent to @xmath36 .",
    "one useful feature of this categorification is that it is easy to calculate the dimension of hom spaces in each degree .",
    "let @xmath58 be the graded vector space ( actually an @xmath2-bimodule ) generated by homogeneous morphisms of all degrees .",
    "let @xmath59 .",
    "then @xmath60 is a free left @xmath2-module , and its graded rank over @xmath2 is given by @xmath61 .    for two subsets @xmath62 , the categories @xmath51 and @xmath63 are embedded in bimodule categories over different rings @xmath64 and @xmath65 , but there is nonetheless a faithful inclusion of categories @xmath66 .",
    "this functor is not full : the size of @xmath2 itself will grow , and @xmath67 .",
    "however , the graded rank over @xmath2 does not change , since the value of @xmath68 and hence @xmath69 does not change over various inclusions .",
    "effectively , the only difference in hom spaces under this inclusion functor is base change on the left , from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .    as a result of this",
    ", most calculations involving morphisms between soergel bimodules will not depend on which @xmath26 we work over .",
    "when @xmath26 is infinite , the ring @xmath2 is no longer noetherian , and we do not wish to deal with such cases . however , the categories @xmath51 over arbitrary finite @xmath26 will all work essentially the same way .",
    "a slightly more rigorous graphical statement of this property is forthcoming .",
    "in particular , the calculations we do for the braid group on @xmath70 strands will also work for the braid group on @xmath71 strands , and so forth .      in @xcite , the category @xmath6 was given a diagrammatic presentation by generators and relations , allowing morphisms to be viewed as isotopy classes of certain graphs .",
    "we review this presentation here , referring the reader to @xcite for more details . we will first deal with the case where @xmath72 , or where @xmath73 , and then discuss what the inclusions of categories from the previous section imply for the general setting .",
    "technically , @xcite gave the presentation for a slightly different category , which we temporarily call @xmath74 .",
    "the category presented here is a quotient of @xmath74 by the central morphism corresponding to @xmath75 , the first symmetric polynomial .",
    "this is discussed briefly in section 4.5 of @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath74 is also a faithful extension of @xmath6 , so that the main results of this paper apply to the extension as well .",
    "we use @xmath6 instead because it is the  minimal \" category required for our results ( no extensions are necessary ) , and because it streamlines the presentation .",
    "we leave it as an exercise to see that the definition of @xmath6 below agrees with the @xmath75 quotient of the category defined in @xcite .",
    "the first subtlety to be addressed is that @xmath6 is only equivalent to the @xmath75 quotient of @xmath74 when one is working over a base ring @xmath17 where @xmath76 is invertible .",
    "otherwise , the quotient of @xmath74 is still a non - trivial faithful extension .    for a discussion of the advantages to using @xmath74 , see section [ subsec - integers ] .",
    "an object in @xmath6 is given by a sequence of indices @xmath30 , which is visualized as @xmath31 points on the real line @xmath77 , labelled or `` colored '' by the indices in order from left to right .",
    "sometimes these objects are also called @xmath78 .",
    "morphisms are given by pictures embedded in the strip @xmath79 $ ] ( modulo certain relations ) , constructed by gluing the following generators horizontally and vertically :        for instance , if `` blue '' corresponds to the index @xmath80 and `` red '' to @xmath81 , then the lower right generator is a morphism from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "the generating pictures above may exist in various colors , although there are some restrictions based on of adjacency conditions .",
    "we can view a morphism as an embedding of a planar graph , satisfying the following properties :    1 .",
    "edges of the graph are colored by indices from @xmath10 to @xmath84 .",
    "2 .   edges may run into the boundary @xmath85 , yielding two sequences of colored points on @xmath77 , the top boundary @xmath30 and the bottom boundary @xmath86 . in this case",
    ", the graph is viewed as a morphism from @xmath86 to @xmath30 .",
    "only four types of vertices exist in this graph : univalent vertices or `` dots '' , trivalent vertices with all three adjoining edges of the same color , 4-valent vertices whose adjoining edges alternate in colors between @xmath80 and @xmath81 distant , and 6-valent vertices whose adjoining edges alternate between @xmath80 and @xmath81 adjacent .",
    "the degree of a graph is + 1 for each dot and -1 for each trivalent vertex .",
    "@xmath87-valent and @xmath88-valent vertices are of degree @xmath89 .",
    "the term _ graph _ henceforth refers to such a graph embedding .    by convention , we color the edges with different colors , but do not specify which colors match up with which @xmath25 .",
    "this is legitimate , as only the various adjacency relations between colors are relevant for any relations or calculations .",
    "we will specify adjacency for all pictures , although one can generally deduce it from the fact that 6-valent vertices only join adjacent colors , and 4-valent vertices join only distant colors .    as usual in a diagrammatic category , composition of morphisms is given by vertical concatenation , and the monoidal structure is given by horizontal concatenation .    in writing the relations",

    "we could have described the category more simply by defining a morphism to be an isotopy class of a certain kind of planar graph .",
    "however , it is useful to understand that these `` isotopy relations '' exist , because they will appear naturally in the study of movie moves ( see section [ subsec - brute ] ) .",
    "other relations are written in a format which already assumes that isotopy invariance is given .",
    "some of these relations contain horizontal lines , which can not be constructed using the generating pictures given ; nonetheless , such a graph is isotopic to a number of different pictures which are indeed constructible , and it is irrelevant which version you choose , so the relation is unambiguous .",

    "thus , we need only investigate morphisms from @xmath113 to @xmath30 , to determine all hom spaces .    there is a functor from this category into the category of @xmath2-bimodules , sending a line colored @xmath80 to @xmath5 and each generator to an appropriate bimodule map .",
    "the functor gives an equivalence of categories between this graphically defined category and the subcategory @xmath6 of @xmath2-bimodules mentioned in the previous section , so the use of the same name is legitimate .",

    "[ colorreduction ] consider a morphism @xmath115 , and suppose that the index @xmath80 appears in @xmath30 zero times ( respectively , once ) . then @xmath116 can be rewritten as a linear combination of graphs , for which each graph has the following property : the only edges of the graph colored @xmath80 are included in double dots ( respectively , as well as a single boundary dot connecting to @xmath30 ) , and moreover , all these double dots are in the leftmost region of the graph .",
    "this result may be obtained simultaneously for multiple indices @xmath80 .",
    "we could also have chosen the rightmost region for the slide .",
    "the space @xmath117 is the free commutative polynomial ring generated by @xmath118 , the double dot colored @xmath80 , for various @xmath25 .",
    "this is a graded ring , with the degree of @xmath118 is 2 .",
    "another corollary of the more general results in @xcite is that , when a color only appears twice in the boundary one can ( under certain conditions on other colors present ) reduce the graph to a form where that color only appears in a line connecting the two boundary appearances ( and double dots as usual ) . in particular ,",
    "if no color appears more than twice on the boundary , then under certain conditions one can reduce all graphs to a form that has no trivalent vertices , and hence all morphisms have nonnegative degree .",
    "we will use this fact to help check movie moves 8 and 9 , in whose contexts the appropriate conditions do hold .",
    "the proof of this theorem involves using the relations to reduce a single color at a time within a graph ( while doing arbitrary things to the other colors ) .",
    "once a color is reduced to the above form , the remainder of the graph no longer interacts with that color .",
    "then we repeat the argument with another color on the rest of the graph , and so on and so forth .",
    "there is a natural identification of the polynomial ring of double dots and the coordinate ring @xmath2 of the geometric representation .",
    "because of this , a combination of double dots is occasionally referred to as a polynomial . placing double dots in the lefthand or righthand region of a diagram will correspond to the left and right action of @xmath2 on hom spaces .",
    "now we are in a position to see how the inclusion @xmath119 behaves .",

    "doing this to each color in @xmath122 , we will have a collection of double dots next to a morphism which only uses colors in @xmath26 .",

    "these sequences can be drawn using braid diagrams on the plane , where @xmath143 is an overcrossing ( the @xmath146 strand crosses over the @xmath8 strand ) and @xmath147 is an undercrossing .",
    "objects have a monoidal structure given by concatenation of sequences .",
    "a _ movie _ is a finite sequence of transformations of two types : + i. reidemeister type moves , such as    @xmath148    @xmath149    @xmath150    where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are arbitrary braid words .",
    "addition or removal of a single @xmath143 or @xmath147 from a braid word    @xmath153    these transformations are known as _ movie generators_. morphisms in this category will consist of movies modulo _ locality moves _ , which ensure that the category is a monoidal category , and certain relations known as _ movie moves _ ( it is common also to refer to locality moves as movie moves ) .",
    "the movie moves can be found in figures [ mma ] and [ mmb ] .",
    "movie moves @xmath154 are composed of type i transformations and @xmath155 each contains a unique type ii move .",
    "we denote the location of the addition or removal of a crossing in these last @xmath87 movies by little black triangles .",
    "there are many variants of each of these movies : one can change the relative height of strands , can reflect the movie horizontally or vertically , or can run the movie in reverse .",

    "locality moves merely state that if two transformations are performed on a diagram in locations that do not interact ( they do not share any of the same crossings ) then one may change the order in which the transformations are performed .",
    "any potential functor from the combinatorial cobordism category to a monoidal category @xmath131 which preserves the monoidal structure will automatically satisfy the locality moves .",
    "because of this , we need not mention the locality moves again .    given a braid diagram @xmath157 ( or an object in the cobordism category ) , the diagram @xmath158 is given by reversing the sequence defining @xmath157 , and replacing all overcrossings with undercrossings and vice versa .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that rouquier s association of complexes to a braid is actually _",
    "projectively functorial_. in other words , to each movie between braids , there is a map of complexes , and these maps satisfy the movie move relations ( modulo homotopy ) up to a potential sign .",
    "this was not done by explicitly constructing chain maps , but instead used the formal consequences of the previously - defined link homology theory .",
    "it was known that in many cases the composed map would be an isomorphism , and that this categorification could be done over @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) , where the only isomorphisms are @xmath162 , hence the proof of projective functoriality .",
    "the discussion of the previous sections shows that it is irrelevant which braid group we work in , because adding extra strands just corresponds to an inclusion functor which is `` fully faithful after base change '' . in particular , when computing the space of chain maps modulo homotopy between two complexes , we need not worry about the number of strands available , except to keep track of our base ring . hence calculations are effectively local .",
    "these are the conventions we use to draw rouquier complexes henceforth .",
    "we use a colored circle to indicate the empty graph , but maintain the color for reasons of sanity .",
    "it is immediately clear that in the complex associated to a tensor product of @xmath31 rouquier complexes , each summand will be a sequence of @xmath121 lines where @xmath163 ( interspersed with colored circles , but these represent the empty graph so could be ignored ) .",

    "it follows from this that homotopies will have degree -1 , in order to be degree 0 when the shifts are put back in .",
    "one could put in the degree shifts later , noting that @xmath161 always occurs as a summand in a tensor product exactly once , with degree shift 0 .",

    "4 .   we read tensor products in a braid diagram from bottom to top .",
    "that is , in the following diagram , we take the complex for the blue crossing , and tensor by the complex for the red crossing .",

    "each of these variants has a free parameter @xmath167 , and the parameter used for each variant is actually independent from the other variants .",

    "we prove the claim for generator 1a above ; all the others follow from essentially the same computation .",

    "in fact , the unique ( up to scalar ) non - zero map of homological degree -1 and graded degree -1 is a red trivalent vertex : a red fork which sends the single red line in the second row of the source complex to the double red line in the second row of the target complex . given two chain maps , one with free variable @xmath167 and one with say @xmath168 , the homotopy is given by the above fork map , with coefficient @xmath169 .",
    "the homotopies for the other variants are exactly the same , save for the position , color , and direction of the fork ( there is always a unique map of homological and graded degree -1 ) .    for all movie generators ,",

    "each of the above maps may be multiplied by an invertible scalar .",
    "some relations must be imposed between these scalars , which the reader can determine easily by looking at the movie moves ( each side must be multiplied by the same scalar ) .",
    "movie move 11 forces all slide generators to have scalar @xmath10 .",
    "movie move 13 forces all r3 generators to have scalar @xmath10 .",
    "movie move 14 and 2 combined force the scalar for any r2 generator to be @xmath162 , and then movie moves 2 and 5 force this sign to be the same for all 4 variants .",
    "movie move 12 shows that the scalar for the birth of an overcrossing and the death of an undercrossing are related by the sign for the r2 generator .",
    "so the remaining freedom in the definition of the functor is precisely a choice of one sign and one invertible scalar .",
    "given that the functor @xmath16 has been defined explicitly , checking that the movie moves hold up to homotopy can be done explicitly .",
    "one can write down the chain maps for both complexes , and either check that they agree , or explicitly find the homotopy which gives the difference .",

    "for instance , it would be interesting to define such a category @xmath131 for which one would have all birth and death maps nontrivial ( although the authors have yet to find an _ interesting _ extension of this type ) .",
    "our method of proof , however , is irrelevant and the truth of theorem [ mainthm ] does not depend on it .",
    "one could avoid any machinery by checking each movie move explicitly ( in fact , the only ones that remain to be checked are mm8 , mm9 , and mm10 ) .",
    "checking even a single variant of mm10 by brute force is extremely tedious , since each complex has 64 summands , but it could be done .",
    "in addition , we have actually proven slightly more : for any additive monoidal category @xmath131 having objects @xmath5 and morphisms satisfying the @xmath6 relations , we can define a functor from the braid cobordism category into the homotopy category of complexes in @xmath131 .",
    "this is an obvious corollary , since that same data gives a functor from @xmath7 to @xmath131 .",
    "if one chose to change the birth and death maps , the proof for movie moves 1 through 10 would be unchanged , and one would only need to check 11 through 14 .",
    "one other benefit to ( theoretically ) checking everything by hand is in knowing precisely which coefficients are required , and thus understanding the dependence on the base ring @xmath17 . in all",
    "the movie moves we check in this paper , each differential , chain map , and homotopy has integral coefficients ( or free variables which may be chosen to be integral ) .",
    "in fact , every nonzero coefficient that did nt involve a free variable was @xmath162 , and free variables may be chosen such that every coefficient is 1,0 , or @xmath9 . from our other calculations ,",
    "the same should be true for mm8 through mm10 as well ( khovanov and thomas @xcite already showed that rouquier complexes lift over @xmath18 to a projective functor , which implies the existence of homotopy maps over @xmath18 ) .",
    "the next section discusses the definition of this functor in a @xmath18-linear category .    as an additional bonus ,",
    "checking the movie moves does provide some intuition as to why @xmath6 has the relations that it does .",
    "one might wonder why these particular relations should be correct : in @xcite we know they are correct because they hold in the @xmath2-bimodule category and because they are sufficient to reduce all graphs to a simple form",
    ". there should be a more intuitive explanation .",
    "as an illustrative example , consider the overcrossing - only variation of movie move 10 and the unique summand of lowest ( leftmost ) homological degree : it is a sequence of 6 lines . then the left hand movie and the right hand movie correspond to the following maps on this summand :                more relations are used to imply that certain maps are chain maps , or that homotopies work out correctly . for example , relation ( [ distslidedot ] ) is needed for the slide generator to be a chain map .",
    "one can go even further , although we shall be purposely vague : so long as one disallows certain possibilities ( like degree @xmath219 maps from a red line to a blue line , or negative degree endomorphisms of indecomposable objects ) then our graphical generators must exist a priori , and must satisfy a large number of the relations above .",
    "almost every relation in the calculus is used in a brute force check of functoriality ( including the brute force checks of mm8 - 10 ) . however , there are two exceptions : ( [ assoc1 ] ) and ( [ assoc2 ] ) . both these relations are in degree -2 , and degree -2 does not appear in chain maps or homotopies , so they could not have appeared . nonetheless , they are effectively implied by the remainder of the relations .",
    "it is not hard to use the rest of the one color relations to show that        hence , ( [ assoc1 ] ) will hold , so long as @xmath2 acts freely on morphisms . under this mild assumption",
    ", all the relations are required . while no proof is presented here , it is safe to say that the category @xmath6 is universal amongst all categories for which rouquier complexes could be defined functorially up to type i movie moves ( under suitable conditions on color symmetry and torsion - free double dot actions ) , and that these relations are effectively predetermined",
    ".      knot theorists should be interested in a @xmath18-linear version of the soergel bimodule story , because it could theoretically yield a functorial link homology theory over @xmath18 .",
    "we describe the @xmath18-linear version below . because defining things over @xmath18 is not really the focus of this paper , and because a thorough discussion would require poring over @xcite for coefficients , we do not provide rigorous proofs of the statements in this section .    ignoring the second equality in ( [ dotslidenear ] ) , which is equivalent to ( [ dotslidesame ] ) after multiplication by 2 , every relation given has coefficients in @xmath18 .",
    "one could use these relations to define a @xmath18-linear version of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and then use base extension to define the category over any other ring .",
    "the functor can easily be defined over @xmath18 , as we have demonstrated , and all the brute force checks work without resorting to other coefficients .",
    "theorem [ mainthm ] still holds for the @xmath18-linear version of @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the same method of proof ( using homotopically isolated summands ) will work over @xmath18 in most contexts .",
    "one begins by checking the isomorphisms ( [ dc - ii ] ) through ( [ dc - ipi ] ) .",
    "the only one which is in doubt is @xmath220 .",
    "so long as , for each @xmath80 , there is an adjacent color in @xmath26 , we may use ( [ iidecomp2 ] ) to check this isomorphism .",
    "otherwise , we are forced to use ( [ iidecomp ] ) , which does not have integral coefficients .    for now , assume that adjacent colors are present ; we will discuss the other case below .",
    "one still has a map of algebras from @xmath3 to the additive grothendieck group of @xmath6 .",
    "a close examination of the methods used in the last chapter of @xcite will show that the graphical proofs which classify @xmath221 still work over @xmath18 in this context .",
    "boundary dots with a polynomial will be a spanning set for morphisms .",
    "one can still define a functor into a bimodule category to show that this spanning set is in fact a basis .",
    "therefore , the hom space pairing on @xmath6 will induce a semi - linear pairing on @xmath3 , and it will be the same pairing as before .",
    "hom spaces will be free @xmath18-modules of the appropriate graded rank , and this knowledge suffices to use all the homotopically isolated arguments .",
    "this statement does _ not _ imply that @xmath0 will categorify the hecke algebra when defined over @xmath18 .",
    "there may be missing idempotents , or extra non - isomorphic idempotents , so that the grothendieck ring of the idempotent completion may be too big or small .",
    "if adjacent colors are not present , the easiest thing to do to prove theorem [ mainthm ] is to include @xmath120 into a larger @xmath123 for which adjacent colors are present . since this inclusion is faithful , all movie move checks which hold for @xmath222 will hold for @xmath26 .",
    "alternatively , one could use an extension of the category @xmath120 , extending the generating set by adding more polynomials , either as originally done in @xcite , or by formally adding @xmath223 times the double dot .",
    "both of these should give an integral version of the category where the isomorphism ( [ dc - ii ] ) holds , and where the graphical proofs of @xcite still work .",
    "finally , if one does not mind ignoring 2-torsion , defining the category over @xmath224 $ ] will also work .",
