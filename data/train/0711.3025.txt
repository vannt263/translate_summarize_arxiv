    "all but one of the detected extragalactic very high energy ( vhe , defined by @xmath2 ) gamma ( @xmath3 ) ray sources so far are blazars . within the unified scheme ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , blazars comprise the rare and extreme subclasses of bl  lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "these are characterised by high apparent luminosities , short variability time - scales , and apparent superluminal motion of jet components .",
    "these observations can be explained by highly relativistic , beamed plasma outflows ( jets ) closely aligned to the observer s line of sight @xcite powered by central supermassive black holes accreting at sub - eddington rates @xcite .",
    "the prime scientific interest in vhe @xmath3-ray emitting blazars ( in the following , ` vhe blazars ' ) is twofold : ( 1 ) to understand the particle acceleration and @xmath3-ray production mechanisms , assumed to take place in the jets and to be linked to the central supermassive black hole ( bh ) .",
    "knowledge of the vhe emission process will also contribute to the further understanding of the accretion processes in agn , jet formation processes , and the jet structure .",
    "( 2 ) to use the vhe @xmath3-rays as a probe of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectrum in the wavelength range between about @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "determining the ebl spectrum in this wavelength range may allow to constrain the star formation rate ( convolved with the initial mass function ) in the early universe . in order to assess both issues , it is essential to have a large sample of vhe @xmath3-ray blazars at hand",
    ". ideally it should encompass a wide range in redshift for ebl studies and at the same time include groups of sources at similar distances in order to probe and compare properties of the individual sources without possible systematic uncertainties caused by the ebl de - absorption .",
    "the preconditions for such studies have much improved recently : before 2004 , only a few nearby extragalactic sources had been established as vhe @xmath3-ray emitters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and provided hardly enough data to perform comparative studies . around 2004 , the third generation of imaging air cerenkov telescopes ( iacts , e.g. magic , @xcite and h.e.s.s . , @xcite ) , the most successful tools so far to explore vhe @xmath3-rays , started to deliver scientific results .",
    "to date , the vhe blazar sample with available spectral information in the vhe region comprises 17 bl lac objects , among them one lbl object , bl  lacertae .",
    "furthermore , now the redshifts of the known vhe blazars reach up to @xmath6  or even to @xmath7 , considering the recently announced discovery of the first fsrq in vhe @xmath3-rays , 3c  279 @xcite . for 3c  279 , however , no vhe spectrum has been published yet , therefore the vhe luminosity and spectral slope of 3c  279 are not yet available for this study .",
    "m87 , a fr  i radio galaxy also detected in vhe @xmath3-rays , is not included in the study , as its vhe @xmath3-ray production mechanism may differ from that in blazars @xcite .",
    "[ fig : comp : sp ] shows the sky positions of the known vhe blazars in galactic coordinates along with the agn identified in the 3rd egret catalogue .",
    "the electromagnetic continuum spectra of blazars extend over many orders of magnitude from radio frequencies to sometimes multi - tev energies and are dominated by non - thermal emission that consists in a @xmath8 representation of two pronounced peaks .",
    "the low - energy peak , located between the ir and hard x - rays , is thought to arise from synchrotron emission of ultrarelativistic electrons , accelerated by shocks moving along the jets at relativistic bulk speed .",
    "depending on the location of the low - energy peak , bl  lac objects are often referred to as high - frequency peaked ( hbl ; in the uv to x - ray domain ) or low - frequency peaked ( lbl ; in the near - ir to optical ) bl  lac objects @xcite , although the transition is smooth rather than dichotomic .",
    "the origin of the high - energy peak at mev to tev energies is still debated .",
    "it is commonly explained by inverse compton upscattering of low - energy photons by electrons .",
    "the seed photons may originate from synchrotron radiation produced by the same electron population ( synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) models ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or belong to ambient thermal photon fields ( external inverse compton models ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in hadronic models , which can also explain the observed features , interactions of a highly relativistic jet outflow with ambient matter @xcite , proton - induced cascades @xcite , synchrotron radiation by protons @xcite , or curvature radiation , are responsible for the high energy photons .",
    "the agn identified in the egret data are predominantly powerful fsrqs and quasars with seds peaking at rather low frequencies , and thus only few of these ( mkn 421 , pks 2155 - 304 , bl  lacertae and 3c  279 ) were also detected in the vhe range .",
    "knowing the variability time - scales of the vhe @xmath3-ray emission and the form of the two - bump spectral energy distribution ( sed ) enables the derivation of all input parameters of one - zone ssc models @xcite , which describe the observed emission in bl  lac objects reasonably well .",
    "strictly simultaneous and temporally - resolved measurements of the sed , however , are only rarely possible and more often than not are also severely restricted by the ( temporal ) instrumental resolution .",
    "generally , detailed spectral studies particularly in low - emission states are rather demanding .",
    "in addition , the determination of the location of the high - energy peak @xmath9 generally would require complementary satellite detector coverage of the sed between some hundred mev and @xmath10  gev .",
    "this region of the sed , however , is difficult to access due to the low fluxes expected ( up to @xmath11 mev ) from extragalactic sources in between the two bumps and due to insufficient instrumental sensitivity for energies exceeding some gevs .    in this paper , for the first time studies of the vhe emission properties of the complete set of all currently known vhe blazars ( cf . tab .",

    "note that due to the fact that the vhe @xmath3-rays are attenuated exponentially with the optical depth , an accurate knowledge of the ebl is crucial for the individual interpretation of the intrinsic vhe @xmath3-ray spectra .    in the following ,",
    "i will use two observables to characterise the vhe @xmath3-ray emission : the @xmath21-corrected @xcite luminosity at @xmath22 , @xmath23 with the luminosity distance @xmath24 and the intrinsic photon index @xmath12 in the region around 500  gev , which is determined by fitting the intrinsic spectra with pure power - laws of the form @xmath25 .",
    "these two parameters act as proxies for the peak position and the spectral shape on the falling edge of the high - energy bump , which can not , as explained before , easily be determined from the existing vhe data . for extraction of the luminosity and of the spectral slope , the region around 500 gev was chosen because all blazars under study have measured spectra in this energy region .",
    "all calculations and fits have been performed in energy ranges where @xmath3-ray spectra for the respective blazars have actually been observed , so that no extrapolations in energy regions not covered by the data were required .",
    "all in all , extragalactic source observations included in this paper cover the energy range @xmath26 . for the determination of the luminosity distances the cosmological parameters given in @xcite were used : @xmath27 ; @xmath28 with the hubble constant @xmath29 .    tab .  [ tab : parvhe ] also shows the resulting source luminosities in the vhe region and the spectral slope of the reconstructed source - intrinsic spectra . while the luminosities range from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 to @xmath33 for blazars in outburst ) , the photon indices of the reconstructed intrinsic spectra vary between @xmath34 , except for 1es1101 - 232 , which probably has an intrinsic spectrum peaking far beyond @xmath35tev @xcite .",
    "the vhe measurements lie close to , but generally above the maximum of the high - energy bump ( which occurs at @xmath36 ) .",
    "spectra with @xmath37 are difficult to explain in current acceleration models ( @xcite ; but see @xcite for models that would explain harder spectra ) .",
    "the rather hard intrinsic slopes found for some sources go in line with indications that the ebl absorption effects are still smaller than currently modelled ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) : a lower ebl level would soften the intrinsic spectra inferred here , i.e. increase the value of @xmath12 .    before instruments like magic and h.e.s.s . became operational , the average observed photon index in bl  lac objects was @xmath38 .",
    "this raised the expectation that agn would in general exhibit rather hard spectra in the vhe range , which also would be compatible with the average egret blazar spectrum ( at mev - gev energies ) , found to have a slope of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the average spectral slope at vhe has not changed much , although the scatter of @xmath12 increased as a new population of objects with intrinsically rather soft spectra ( mkn180 , pks2005 - 489 ) has been tapped , and at the same time distant , hard - spectrum sources were found .    for pg1553 + 113 with its unknown redshift ( see sect .

    "why are only blazars with rather hard intrinsic spectra visible at large distances ( @xmath66 ) ?",
    "soft spectra certainly fall more easily below the current instrumental sensitivity limits .",
    "another explanation for the prevalent hard spectra at large @xmath63 is an overcorrection of the ebl attenuation effects .",

    "two curves indicate the sensitivity limit of current iacts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "interestingly , most of the sources found at @xmath68 seem to be rather low - luminosity sources in the sense that their luminosity is not much higher than the current instrumental sensitivity allows for .",
    "this means that not only the substantially lower energy thresholds of the current iacts ( @xmath69  gev as compared to @xmath70  gev until 2004 ) , but also their increased sensitivity enabled some of the new blazar discoveries .",

    "note further that h1426 + 428 has not yet been detected after 2002 ( e.g. @xcite ) , which also currently places it below sensitivity limits .",

    "currently , only @xmath51 can be reliably estimated ; the bh spin remains inaccessible by large .",
    "moreover , the environment in which the bh is embedded might be equally important ; one of its properties , the accretion rate , is indirectly accessible through the ( radio ) jet power @xcite , or from multiwavelength modelling @xcite .",
    "a previous study of the connection of spectral properties and @xmath51 for five vhe blazars @xcite did not find any correlations with the bh mass .    for 15 vhe blazars with known bh masses , i neither find a correlation between @xmath51 and the spectral slope @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp : compaspecs]a ) , nor between @xmath51 and the vhe @xmath3-ray luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp : compaspecs]b ) .",

    "moreover , vhe emission properties may also depend sensitively on the bh spin , the accretion rate , or on properties of the acceleration region in the jet .",
    "also results on timing properties ( see sect .  [ sect : dcsect ] ) support such claims .",
    "the redshift determination for blazars is challenging , as these agn generally exhibit only weak spectral lines .",
    "in several attempts , no emission or absorption lines could be found in the optical / ir spectrum of pg1553 + 113 ; see e.g. @xcite for results of a recent very large telescope ( vlt ) campaign .",
    "the frequently cited initial determination of @xmath71 @xcite was found to be based on a misidentified emission line and could not be reproduced @xcite .",
    "vlt optical spectroscopy @xcite yields a lower limit of @xmath72 , while the analysis of hubble space telescope images leads to the prediction of a redshift in the range of @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "indirect methods employing the maximum slope @xcite or the shape @xcite of the vhe @xmath3-ray spectrum find upper limits of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .    with increasing distance , the luminosity of pg1553 + 113 has to increase stronger than quadratic due to ebl @xmath20 absorption as to sustain the measured vhe flux .",
    "[ fig : comp:1553lumilim ] shows the source luminosity ( 1 ) when only considering the distance effect and ( 2 ) when also taking into account the ebl absorption . due to the exponential behaviour of the ebl attenuation ,",
    "the latter effect is by far dominant .",
    "i assume here that pg1553 + 113 is an ` off the shelf ' blazar , i.e. with no extraordinarily high luminosity @xmath13 .",
    "this assumption is difficult to quantify ; given the overall dynamical range of the ( non - flare ) blazar luminosities in this study of @xmath76 , i consider the case in which the luminosity of pg1553 + 113 is not more than 30 ( 1000 ) times higher than the highest luminosity found in the sample .",
    "further , pg1553 + 113 has in two years of observations not shown any apparent flaring behaviour ; within a factor of three , the measured flux was constant @xcite .",
    "therefore i consider only sources in non - flare states , of which 1es1218 + 304 with @xmath77 is the most luminous one .",
    "a 30-times higher luminosity then implies a limit of @xmath78 , while an extreme luminosity of @xmath79 yields a limit of @xmath80 .",
    "these limits do not only depend on a good knowledge of the ebl over a wide range in redshift , but also on the assumed maximum vhe blazar luminosity that strongly depends on the doppler factor @xmath81 . in any case , either a strikingly high luminosity or a very high @xmath81 is needed to explain the observations should pg1553 + 113 be more distant than @xmath82 .",
    "note that @xmath83 suffices for most of the blazars modelled up to now during non - outburst times , as also for flare observations ( e.g. mkn421 , * ? ? ?",
    "ssc modelling for pg1553 + 113 resulted in @xmath84 @xcite .    the difficulties in finding emission and absorption lines might indicate a very close alignment of the jet axis of pg  1553 + 113 to our line of sight",

    "these results can not yet be used for quantitative correlation studies though .",
    "we have to eventually consider the possibilities that pg1553 + 113 is a rather distant source and the blazar populations at large distances show significantly different properties than the close - by objects at @xmath85 , and that such very extreme objects are so rare that a sufficiently large volume had to be probed to find one of them .      following a method described in @xcite ,",
    "i determine the time fraction ( ` duty cycle ' ) for which the @xmath86 x - ray flux exceeds the average flux by 50 per cent . in this paper , for a blazar to be regarded ` on duty ' this deviation is additionally required to be significant on the @xmath87 level .",

    "objects which are classified as extreme bl  lacs ( mkn  501 , 1es2344 + 514 , h1426 + 428 ,",
    "h2356 - 309 and pks0548 - 322 , ) show substantially higher activity than the other blazars .",
    "note also the outstanding role of mkn 421 with its substantially higher duty cycle as compared to all other objects .",
    "[ fig : comp : compaspecstime]a shows the duty cycle as a function of the bh mass for the vhe blazars .",
    "no trends are visible , except for the observation that the three blazars with the most massive bhs ( @xmath88 ) do not have duty cycles in excess of 17 per cent .",
    "this goes in line with a speculation of an anticorrelation between the x - ray flare duty cycle and @xmath51 seen in the five vhe blazars studied in @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the x - ray duty cycle as a function of luminosity is found to be rather flat ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp : compaspecstime]b ) , supporting the claim that variability on all scales is a defining property of blazars .",
    "note , however , that mkn501 and pks2155 - 304 , the objects which show the fastest variability in vhe @xmath3-rays , are among the objects with a rather low duty cycle .",
    "blazars are characterised by a highly variable emission .",
    "in particular the vhe @xmath3-ray emission is often found to be more variable than the emission at other wavelenghts .",
    "still , comprehensive data on the temporal behaviour of vhe blazar emission has often been collected only for blazars in outburst , and thus , over short time spans .",
    "although vhe light curves ranging over ten years worth of measurements were collected occasionally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sampling is only sparse , and continuous , unbiased long - term monitoring campaigns have not been started until 2005 @xcite .",
    "variability time - scales @xmath89 are intimately linked to the extension of the region @xmath90 from which the observed emission originates by the causality condition @xmath91 .",
    "@xcite has suggested that the flare hierarchy seen in mkn  501 long - term data implies a scale - invariant nature of the flare process and that there might not be any fundamental difference among long , intermediate and rapid flares .",
    "although not thoroughly understood , the flares in blazars might be related to internal shocks in the jet @xcite or to major ejection events of new components of relativistic plasma into the jet @xcite .",
    "different flare time - scales thus may be caused by a hierarchy of inhomogeneities in the jet , energised so as to produce flares . as a timing property of the vhe @xmath3-ray emission ,",
    "the minimum flux doubling times for the vhe blazars were collected from literature and plotted versus @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp : compaspecstime2]a ) and the vhe luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp : compaspecstime2]b ) .",
    "because of the very limited data base of vhe variability measurements , which also is biased towards high - flux states and outbursts , time - scales are mostly given as upper limits , which disables strong conclusions .",
    "the observed vhe flux doubling times do not scale with the bh mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp : compaspecstime2]a ) , which may simply mean that ( 1 ) the flaring mechanism is working in a much smaller region than the bh radius / least stable orbit and more importantly ( 2 ) the bh and its properties as such do not influence the flaring process substantially , and the embedding environment of the bh and the jet environment play more dominant roles ( e.g. , the accretion power of the system ) .",
    "the extremely short doubling times of @xmath92  min recently found for mkn  501 @xcite and pks  2155 - 304 @xcite clearly do not support such a scaling either ; even more , they are vastly incompatible with the rotation period of particles on the last stable orbit , which e.g. for the bh in mkn  501 is @xmath93  d. additionally , the size scale implied by @xmath92  min requires large doppler factors @xmath81 in the @xmath3-ray production regions as to avoid self - absorption .",
    "in contrast to the expected scaling behaviour of the flow properties around bh with their masses , the three agn that host rather massive bhs , pks2155 - 304 , mkn  501 and mkn  421 were found to exhibit the shortest variability time - scales . until minute - scale flaring was found in pks2155 - 304",
    ", one could have argued that short time variability could only be measured for high fluxes due to the proximity of the respective sources : mkn 421 and mkn 501 are the closest blazars at @xmath94 , while pks  2155 - 304 is located at @xmath95 .",
    "the present observations could , however , still be the cause of a selection effect : minute - scale flares were found only during exceptional high - flux states of the respective sources so far .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp : geometrical ] i translate the bh masses into the corresponding gravitational radii @xmath96 ( = @xmath97  schwarzschild radius ) and the observed minimal variability time - scales into the sizes of the emission regions @xmath98 , assuming @xmath99 . for blazars in which fast variability has been observed , the extreme compactness of the emission region is apparent , being clearly comparable to or smaller than the schwarzschild radius of the central bh . even if the flares were driven by extremely large doppler factors , say @xmath100 , this would still result in emission regions smaller than the schwarzschild radius for the mkn501 and pks2155 - 304 flares .",
    "before the new generation of iact became operational , only six firmly detected extragalactic vhe @xmath3-ray sources were known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; not for all of them differential energy spectra had been inferred . to date , there are 17 bl lac objects and the fsrq 3c  279 known to emit vhe @xmath3-rays .",
    "this substantially enlarged set of blazars called for a synoptic study .",
    "i collected and derived intrinsic properties of the vhe @xmath3-ray emission ( luminosity , spectral hardness , temporal properties ) and further included x - ray , optical and radio emission properties . as an accessible property of the bhs in the centres of the blazar host galaxies ,",
    "the bh mass was also used .",
    "the studies yield the following results .",
    "* so far , only blazars with @xmath101 show vhe @xmath3 emission .",
    "whether this experimental finding constitutes a selection effect or will reveal interesting physics , remains to be seen . *",
    "the vhe luminosity of the blazars under study and the corresponding x - ray luminosity show a hint of a correlation , as expected from leptonic acceleration / ssc models .",
    "* a correlation between the spectral slope in the vhe region and the peak location of the synchrotron peak is found .",
    "such a correlation is also expected from ssc models .",
    "* there were no correlations found between the @xmath3 emission properties and the @xmath51 of the galaxies that host the blazars .",
    "also , no correlation of @xmath51 could be observed with the flare duty cycles and the flare time - scales .",
    "thus , vhe @xmath3-ray emission properties may not dominantly depend on @xmath51 .",
    "other possibly interesting bh parameters are not yet within instrumental reach .",
    "* there is an indication that the vhe @xmath3 luminosity is correlated with the spectral hardness .",
    "this correlation can be formulated as a decrease of @xmath102 per decade of luminosity . *",
    "this behaviour is also found for some individual blazars that were observed in different emission states : there are indications that in some variable sources the observed spectra become harder with increasing luminosity , while in others no hardening is found .",
    "investigations of the temporal properties of the x - ray emission show that the blazars with the most massive bhs have rather low duty cycles .",
    "the temporal behaviour of the vhe @xmath3-ray emission is not well studied for most of the vhe blazars , but the present data do not seem to support a scaling of the flux doubling time - scales with the bh masses .    obviously we are still dealing with a low number of sources and certainly with an incomplete source sample , which leaves regions in the parameter space empty .",
    "nevertheless , the rather impressive number of 17 vhe blazars has permitted first comparative studies .",
    "it also allows conclusions concerning ebl models : a hint at a marginal correlation between the intrinsic spectral hardness and the source distance is likely due to an ebl over - prediction .",
    "this result was also recently quantified by @xcite using the two distant blazars 1es1101 - 232 and h  2356 - 309 . in clarifying the situation , more distant sources particularly with intrinsically hard spectra ( as e.g. 1es0229 + 200 ) will play a decisive role ; pg1553 + 113 with its yet undetermined distance might also turn out to be a good candidate for such analyses once a measurement of its redshift succeeds . in the meantime , the observed luminosity distribution of the studied vhe @xmath3 blazars was used to constrain the unknown distance of pg1553 + 113 by assuming that the properties of this blazar are not too different from the most extreme objects in the blazar sample .",
    "conversely , a large distance of pg1553 + 113 implies an unusually high luminosity or an unusually high doppler factor .",
    "it can be said that the era of blazar astronomy has been entered ",
    "astronomy being understood as the study of generic properties of a given class of objects . with the currently known vhe blazars and the given instrumental sensitivity , vhe blazar astronomy starts to become less biased : not only blazars with hard spectra or during outbursts",
    "have been detected , but also low ( quiescent ? ) emission states in the vhe range are now being observed and studied .    with continuing discoveries of new sources , it will become easier to disentangle ebl absorption effects and intrinsic absorption effects from the measured spectra .",
    "already currently , the vhe blazar sample contains groups of objects at very similar distances , e.g. 1es1218 + 304 and 1es1101 - 232 ( @xmath103 ) , or the triplet 1es2344 + 514 , mkn  180 and 1es1959 + 650 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "such groups are ideal for direct comparisons between the respective individual objects , as they are subject to very similar ebl attenuation .",
    "since 2003 , on average three new blazars have been detected per year .",
    "when comparing this rate to the ten years it took to discover the first six vhe blazars , one can with good reason hope to accumulate many more sources in the near future , which will refine synoptic blazar studies as the pioneering one conducted here .",
    "in addition , the first observation of new object classes like lbls and fsrqs will certainly help to sharpen the vhe view of a possible blazar sequence and the underlying physics in the near future .",

    "<S> since 2002 , the number of detected blazars at gamma - ray energies above 100 gev has more than doubled . </S>",
    "<S> i study 17 blazars currently known to emit @xmath0  gev gamma rays . </S>",
    "<S> their intrinsic energy spectra are reconstructed by removing extragalactic background light attenuation effects . </S>",
    "<S> luminosity and spectral slope in the @xmath0  gev region are then compared and correlated among each other , with x - ray , optical and radio data , and with the estimated black hole ( bh ) masses of the respective host galaxies .    according to expectations from synchrotron self - compton emission models , a correlation on the 3.6-@xmath1 significance level between gamma - ray and x - ray fluxes </S>",
    "<S> is found , while correlations between gamma - ray and optical / radio fluxes are less pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> further , a general hardening of the blazar spectra in the @xmath0  gev region with increasing gamma - ray luminosity is observed , both for the full 17-source sample and for those sources which have been detected at distinct flux levels . </S>",
    "<S> this goes in line with a correlation of the gamma - ray luminosity and the synchrotron peak frequency , which is also seen . </S>",
    "<S> tests for possible selection effects reveal a hardening of the spectra with increasing redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the blazar gamma - ray emission might depend on the mass of the central bh . </S>",
    "<S> the blazars under study do , however , show no correlation of the bh masses with the spectral index and the luminosity in the @xmath0  gev region .    </S>",
    "<S> i also consider temporal properties of the x - ray and @xmath0  gev gamma - ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> no general trends are found , except for the observation that the blazars with the most massive bhs do not show particularly high duty cycles . </S>",
    "<S> these blazars include mkn501 and pks2155 - 304 , for which recently very fast flares have been reported . </S>",
    "<S> in general , vhe flare time - scales are not found to scale with the bh mass .    as a specific application of the luminosity study , a constraint for the still undetermined redshift of the blazar pg1553 + 113 is discussed .    </S>",
