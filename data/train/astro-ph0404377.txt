    "two smaller ring structures are identified to encircle the `` cavities '' noticed by f04 ; a third larger ring centers at the m87 nucleus .",
    "we adopt the distance to m87 as @xmath0 mpc with 1  for @xmath1 pc in the image @xcite .",
    "we process the data of two observations ( obs - id 2707 and 352 ) pointed at m87 in the central virgo cluster by the acis - s ( advanced ccd imaging spectrometer spectroscopic array ) instrument aboard nasa s _ chandra x - ray observatory _ for a total effective exposure of 119.2 ks .",

    "the reality of ring 1 and 2 is evident by figure [ virgo]b .",
    "besides the northern and southern diffuse arcs for the initial identification of ring 3 , the ring also passes through eight bright x - ray knots ( marked by small open arrows ) that lend further support for its reality .",

    ", the right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) , semi major and minor axes , and the inclination angle of the semi major axis to the local hour circle line . because the three x - ray rings can not be readily recognized by our software , errors in these fitting parameters are estimated empirically .",

    "the jet orientation may be taken as either 43  @xcite relative to the line of sight ( los ) away from us or more likely 15  ( within 19  as inferred by * ? ? ?",
    "the angle of the projected jet to the local hour circle line is @xmath20 70  ( figure [ virgo ] ) .",
    "thus , the angle @xmath21 ( see table  [ rings_tab ] ) of the reconstructed circular ring normal to the jet direction ( if 43  to los ) is 61 , 51  and 9  for ring 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "this means that ring 3 is likely a circular ring nearly perpendicular to the m87 jet . for a jet orientation of 15  to the los ,",
    "the corresponding angles @xmath22 of ring normal to the jet ( see table  [ rings_tab ] ) are 55 , 33  and 22 , respectively .",
    "the derived values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for presumed ` circular ' ring 1 and 2 are fairly large ; these two rings might be elliptical in the 3-d space or their orientations are not perpendicular to the jet .",
    "our estimate excludes the possibility that the elliptical shape of rings 1 and 2 is caused by relativistic projection effects if the two circular rings expand radially away from the jet axis while moving apart from each other relativistically along the line connecting the two ring centers , because by special relativity the ring would be elongated transverse to the jet direction .",
    "we note that ring 3 passes through eight x - ray bright knots with its center located exactly at the m87 nucleus .",
    "the chance of such a coincidence is small .    as projected ring 1 and 2",
    "roughly align along the direction of the m87 jet and counter jet , their intrinsic elliptical ( instead of circular ) shapes in 3-d space are plausible .",
    "given relatively small angle of the ring 3 normal to the jet ( 9  or 22 ) , one may qualitatively regard ring 3 as circular and perpendicular to the jet .",
    "from figure [ hr ] , the softest regions locate at ( i ) around the jet within a @xmath2020  radius sector from west to north of the nucleus , ( ii ) an extended arc coincident with the east portion of ring 1 from north to south of the nucleus , ( iii ) a short arc coincident with ring 3 about @xmath2030  away from the nucleus in the northwest and ( iv ) some extended filaments southeast of the nucleus outside the three rings . by comparing figure [ hr ] with the h@xmath23+[n ii ] emissions of the central virgo cluster @xcite",
    ", we find that the soft region ( i ) and ( iv ) are correlated with h@xmath23+[n ii ] filaments .",
    "similar correlations were also found in the perseus cluster @xcite , indicating that intracluster gases become cooler when adjacent to the filaments due to thermal conduction .",
    "the association of regions ( ii ) and ( iii ) with ring 1 and 3 respectively is interesting with region ( ii ) being more striking .",
    "a harder spectrum may correspond to a higher temperature .",
    "different temperatures along ring 1 indicate that x - ray emissions may not be simply caused by a high density of electrons alone , but may involve supersonic shock flows from the agn .",
    "other parts of rings without temperature difference relative to surroundings might indicate subsonic flows .",
    "energy spectra are derived from two segments of ring 1 , viz .",
    ", the east part identified with region ( ii ) and the west part . to compare the spectra in these two parts with their environments , the source region",
    "is partitioned as an elliptical annulus along ring 1 with a width of @xmath204  and a background region of a bigger elliptical annulus outside 5  of ring 1 with a width of @xmath202 .",
    "the source and background regions are separated into two parts by a straight solid line in figure [ hr ] .    in figure [ hr ] , the east part carries features , while the west part blends with the environment .",
    "we adopt a hot diffuse gas emission model ( vmekal ) to fit the spectra of both parts , with free parameters of equivalent hydrogen column , temperature and elemental abundances of o , ne , mg , si , s and fe .",
    "the fitting is carried out using _ xspec _ 11.3 .",
    "the best - fit temperatures are @xmath24 kev ( @xmath25 ) for the east part and @xmath26 kev ( @xmath27 ) for the west part .",
    "a remarkable difference in plasma temperature can be seen from energy spectra using the hardness ratio map in figure [ hr ] .",
    "in contrast , only the central ring of sn1987a can be resolved by _",
    "chandra _ using a sub - pixel technique @xcite . as its x - ray spectrum",
    "may be fit by a plane - parallel shock model , the central ring of sn1987a is thought to involve an expanding blast wave . by this clue",
    ", we attempt to fit the spectra of both east and west parts of ring 1 ( figure [ virgo]b ) using the plane - parallel shock model ( vpshock ) with the same free parameters of elemental abundance indicated above . the west part spectrum does not fit the plane - parallel model well with a large @xmath28 , while the east part spectrum fits well with the shock model .",
    "the best - fit temperature is @xmath29 kev ( @xmath30 ) , consistent with the hot plasma model .",
    "this suggests that ring 1 may involve a blast wave where the west part might have been thermalized with the surroundings and the east part might be in the process of being thermalized .",
    "for the east part , the best - fit abundances of elements o , si , s , and fe in the thermal model are systematically lower than that in the west part .",
    "the enhancement of abundances in the warmer region may indicate more active nuclear processes in the past , perhaps caused by the thermalization in the west part .",
    "the similar temperature - abundance correlation is also found with _",
    "xmm _ in the inner region for radius @xmath311  @xcite and for the two large - scale arms @xcite .",
    "because of uncertainties in estimating abundances with _",
    "data for the fine structures , we refrain from more detailed comparisons with previous results of _ xmm _ for the larger structures .",
    "the triple - ring pattern revealed in the central virgo cluster is the only one observed since the discovery of triple rings in sn1987a @xcite .",
    "the ring sizes in the virgo cluster are several thousand times larger than those of sn1987a .",
    "the triple - ring structure of sn1987a has been simulated in terms of interacting winds near the end of stellar evolution . according to @xcite , during the star s red supergiant phase , slower winds persist .",
    "prior to the supernova explosion , the red supergiant somehow evolved into a blue supergiant that drove faster winds .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) interactions of fast and slow winds from a rotating star produce the triple - ring structure in sn1987a .",
    "we suspect that a triple - ring structure might be generic in a rotating system involving magnetized faster winds catching up slower winds @xcite .",
    "meanwhile a central source of radiation is required for the rings to shine in the x - ray band . for sn1987a ,",
    "the strong uv radiation from the supernova provides the necessary illumination .",
    "we suspect that a catastrophic merging event around the m87 nucleus might be responsible for the triple - ring structure revealed here .",
    "merging of two smbh systems has been proposed to drive the observed x - shaped radio lobes @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "a ` slower wind ' was present before the merging begins , e.g. , a mixture of galactic winds from two merging galaxies .",
    "a ` faster wind ' was then driven during the merging process .",
    "it has been suggested that an active agn phase occurred in the core region of m87 at about @xmath32 years ago @xcite ; perhaps , this agn was triggered by the merging event discussed above , when significantly higher accretion rate was provided by the merger .",
    "the merger may fuel both the radiation energy output of the agn and the growth of the supermassive black hole in the center ; huge amount of high energy radiation shines the triple rings in x - ray bands .",
    "it is also plausible that the resulting smbh spins rapidly to power the highly collimated m87 jets @xcite .",
    "f04 revealed two expanding cavities around the m87 jet and counter jet , enclosed within our ring 1 and 2 respectively . by different external pressures",
    ", they inferred the far front of the cavities is mildly supersonic while the inner part , close to the nucleus , is collapsing .",
    "we suggest that these two rings are actual rings instead of projections of prolate spheres , because when two cavities collide into each other it is hard to maintain their spherical shapes in the spatially overlapping portions of the two spheroids , and consequently their projections can not be viewed as two complete and nested rings .",
    "we further suggest that when the jets form , they push materials around and drive powerful blast waves of ring shapes .",
    "qualitatively similar central structures are present in the clusters perseus @xcite , hydra a @xcite , centaurus a @xcite and virgo ( f04 ) .",
    "physically , core activities can excite large - scale acoustic waves ( @xmath33modes ) and internal gravity waves ( @xmath34modes ) in a deep gravitational potential well of central galaxy cluster @xcite .",
    "cluster core activities can be either violent and sporadic or sustained at a level or a combination of both .",
    "depending on the phase of acoustic wave propagation and on physical properties of core environment , we may observe various x - ray morphologies superposed onto a smooth luminous core .",
    "beautiful acoustic rings or arcs have been revealed in perseus @xcite and in virgo on larger scales ( f04 ) .",
    "intense core x - ray emissions tend to induce inflows of gas that perturb the dark matter via gravity .",
    "the violent relaxation proceeds in a sound - crossing timescale @xcite .",
    "this could be a persistent source of @xmath33modes and @xmath34modes in a cluster core . by such wave and laudau - damping processes , slowly inward drifting gas and dark matter are virialized to sustain x - ray losses from hot electron gas . as a cluster core may involve magnetic field of strengths up to @xmath35 g",
    ", mhd waves should also play significant roles .",
    "based on the hardness ratio map and the energy spectra fitting , we infer only parts of ring 1 and 3 involve supersonic shock flows and are in processes of being thermalized with the surroundings . by this reasoning ,",
    "other parts without apparent difference with surroundings might have been thermalized already . in summary",
    ", we hope that the triple - ring structure of m87 in the central virgo cluster would stimulate more theoretical , simulation and observational studies of mhd flow , wave and shock interactions .",
