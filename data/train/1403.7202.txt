    "@xmath0  carinae ( @xmath0  car ) is one of the most well observed and , at the same time , mysterious and poorly understood objects in the night sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "at a distance of @xmath5  kpc @xcite in the young cluster trumpler  16 in the carina nebula , @xmath0  car is a very luminous and massive evolved star ( @xmath6  l@xmath7 , @xmath8  m@xmath7 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , a high mass - loss luminous blue variable ( lbv ) , in an eccentric binary system @xcite .",
    "the system is surrounded by a dusty , massive ( @xmath9  m@xmath7 , @xcite ) bipolar nebula , the homunculus nebula , that was ejected @xmath10  years ago in the great eruption @xcite .",
    "the great eruption ( ge ) of @xmath0  car in the mid-1800s ( @xmath11 ) was a spectacular astronomical event , a bright and energetic transient visible to the naked eye that was observed and registered by many ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although we do not understand the physical mechanism that caused @xmath0  car s ge , it is used as a standard reference for understanding episodic mass - loss in very massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lbvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supernova impostors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the most luminous supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "yet , until recently we only knew it through visual estimates of its brightness and color , due to the technological limitations at the time of this event @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of @xmath0  car s light echoes ( les ) by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter r12a ) now gives us the opportunity to re - observe the multiple brightening events of @xmath0  car in the mid-1800s with modern instrumentation and from multiple directions @xcite , similar to what has been done for ancient supernovae in the lmc @xcite , sn  1987a @xcite , cas  a @xcite , and tycho @xcite .",
    "in r12a we presented initial imaging and spectroscopy of one of the brightest les of @xmath0  car which showed its unambiguous association with one of the brightenings during the ge instead of the smaller eruption of circa 1890 @xcite .",
    "the spectra of this le obtained in early 2011 showed pure absorption lines consistent with supergiants with spectral type g2@xmath12g5 ( @xmath13  k ) and line velocities of @xmath14  km  s@xmath15 .    in this letter , we present three years of imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations of the light echo of @xmath0  car s ge discovered by r12a . in section   [ sec2 ] we discuss the observations and data reduction . in section   [ sec3 ] we present the results and analysis of the light curve and spectra .",
    "we discuss our results in section   [ sec4 ] .",
    "we observed the field of the @xmath0  carinae le from r12a at many epochs between 2011 and 2014 .",
    "imaging was obtained with a variety of telescopes and instruments , including : the mosaic  ii and decam wide - field cameras mounted on the blanco 4 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , the direct ccd camera mounted on the swope 1 m telescope at las campanas observatory ( lco ) , the spectral ccd camera mounted on the fts 2 m telescope at the las cumbres observatory global telescope network ( lcogt ) siding spring site @xcite , the soar optical imager mounted on the soar 4 m telescope at the cerro pachn , the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ldss  3 mounted on the magellan  baade 6.5 m telescope at lco .",
    "most of the images were obtained using the sdss @xmath1-band filter , with some epochs obtained using the sdss @xmath16 filters , most of which were obtained with decam .",
    "standard image reduction was performed on all the images , including bias / overscan subtraction and flat - fielding using skyflats and domeflats .",
    "we then ran a difference imaging analysis using the _ photpipe _ pipeline @xcite that has been used to discover and analyze the light echoes of historical supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath0  car ( r12a ) .",
    "this pipeline produces difference images that are very clean of point sources and allow us to accurately measure the diffuse variable flux of the echo .",
    "we used three @xmath17 pixel ( @xmath18 ) boxes centered on the position of the le ( ra = 10:44:11.886 , dec = @xmath1260:16:00.6 , j2000.0 ) , and along the position angle of the slit used for the spectra ( pa = 339 deg ) , to extract the difference flux light curve .",
    "these fluxes were transformed into the decam ab magnitude system using observations of sdss standards obtained in january 2014 .",
    "the light curve and mean color evolution are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "a complete analysis of the imaging data and light curves will be presented in bianco et al .",
    "( 2014 , in prep . ) .",
    "we obtained several low - resolution ( @xmath19 ) single - slit optical spectra at the le position between march  2011 and january  2014 .",
    "the spectra were obtained with several instruments , including : imacs mounted on the magellan  baade 6.5 m telescope at lco , wfccd mounted on the du  pont 2.5 m telescope at lco , and the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) mounted on the gemini  south 8 m telescope at the gemini observatory ( programs gs-2012b - q-57 , gs-2013a - q-11 , gs-2013b - q-19 ) .",
    "nod - and - shuffle techniques @xcite were used with gmos to improve sky subtraction .",
    "we reduced the imacs and wfccd spectra using the la - cosmic software @xcite and standard routines in iraf ccdred , twodspec and onedspec packages .",
    "the first imacs spectrum was reduced using custom idl scripts ( see r12a ) .",
    "the gmos spectra were reduced using the iraf gemini package and custom idl scripts .",
    "all the spectra were wavelength calibrated with an arc - lamp obtained before or after the science exposures , and flux calibrated using a spectrophotometric standard observed the same night .",
    "the 1d spectra were extracted at a consistent position and with a spatial extraction window of @xmath20 along the slit to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "we applied a telluric correction to all the spectra that was extracted from the spectrophotometric standard star observation .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the spectral time sequence of @xmath0  car s le .",
    "as we showed in r12a , the le studied here is associated with @xmath0  car s ge because the total increase in magnitude observed between 2003 and 2011 was @xmath21  mag , which is inconsistent with the lesser eruption of circa 1890 . the light curve of @xmath0  car s le presented in figure  [ fig1 ] shows the observations obtained between february 2011 and january 2014 , a follow - up campaign started after its discovery .",
    "the light curve has a peak between ut february 6 and march 23 2011 at @xmath1-band surface brightness of @xmath22  mag  arcsec@xmath23 .",
    "after peak , it steadily declined by @xmath24  mag in the first @xmath25  days .",
    "the mean @xmath26 color of the light echo of @xmath27  mag does not change significantly during our observations .    at late times",
    "( @xmath28  days past peak ) , after may 2012 , there is a significant flattening in the light curve and the le stays at a constant @xmath1-band surface brightness of @xmath29  mag  arcsec@xmath23 until our latest observations obtained in january 2014 . in r12a",
    "we concluded that this le was most likely associated with the 1843 outburst observed in the historical light curve ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , given the flat light curve at late times and absence of a re - brightening thus far , which was observed in the historical light curve in 1845 , this now seems very unlikely . at present , the light curve of this le is more consistent with the 1838 peak or even the 1845 peak , but continuing photometric follow - up should give us a more definite answer in the next few years .",
    "this le light curve definitively rules out the lesser eruption of circa 1890 , which lasted @xmath30  years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of the le spectra is shown in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "the first spectra of the echo obtained around peak brightness in march - april 2011 are dominated by absorption lines , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] ) are from the surrounding nebula . ]",
    "characteristic of g2@xmath12g5 type supergiants ( r12a ) .",
    "however , at later times ( starting december 2011 , @xmath31  days after peak ) the lines of the triplet have developed strong p - cygni profiles ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) with resolved absorption and emission components ( @xmath32  km  s@xmath15 ) , characteristic of an expanding photosphere .",
    "the emission line components of the triplet become stronger compared to the absorption at even later epochs .",
    "also , starting in the spectrum obtained on june 2012 ( @xmath33  days after peak ) we see the appearance of the [ ] 7291,7324 forbidden doublet in emission . despite the presence of the resolved lines in emission , we do not see a broad h@xmath34 line component at any time .",
    "we note that such a component could easily be masked by the strong nebular lines of h@xmath34 and [ ] due to the low resolution of our spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the velocities as a function of time of the most significant features in the spectra of the le .",
    "we used cross - correlation techniques in iraf with a set of stellar templates and also the spectral fitting code ulyss[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xcite to estimate the velocities of the absorption - dominated part of the spectrum in the @xmath35    region . both techniques gave consistent results , with mean velocity @xmath36  km  s@xmath15 , where the uncertainty is the error in the mean .",
    "for the emission lines , we measured the position of the peak of the lines fitting a gaussian with splot in iraf .",
    "the measured mean velocity of the 8542    line is @xmath37  km  s@xmath15 and for the [ ] doublet is @xmath38 } = + 124 \\pm 15 $ ]  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "we also measure the velocity of the minimum of the absorption trough of the 8542    line , which gives a mean velocity @xmath39  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the shapes of the triplet absorption features in the first three spectra obtained march to april 2011 show a clear blue asymmetry , with the blue edge of the absorption feature extending to @xmath40  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the full line profiles at these epochs can be well fitted with the addition of two gaussian components with velocities of @xmath41  km  s@xmath15 ( @xmath42   ) and @xmath43  km  s@xmath15 ( @xmath44   ) .",
    "the defining characteristics of the late - time spectra of the le are the strong , broad absorption features seen in the @xmath4  region ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "these strong features appear in the spectrum obtained on december 2011 ( @xmath31  days after peak ) and are present with similar strength in all the late - time spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows a zoom - in of the red part of the spectrum obtained on december 2011 , normalized at @xmath45   .",
    "the strong absorption features observed in the light echo spectra match the wavelengths of some of the rotation - vibration transitions of the cn molecule .",
    "these molecular bands , which resemble steps in the continuum between @xmath46   , are usually observed in the spectra of cool stars , such as carbon stars and red supergiants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the top spectrum in figure  [ fig5 ] shows a red supergiant ( rsg ) model spectrum from @xcite with @xmath47  k , @xmath48 , and @xmath49= 0 $ ] . in order to approximately match the strengths of the cn steps observed in the le spectrum , we have multiplied the rsg model spectrum by a factor of 1.8 after subtracting the continuum normalized at @xmath45",
    "the strongest molecular bands identified in the light echo spectra are the following transitions in the cn red system @xcite : ( @xmath50,@xmath50  ) = ( 3,0 ) at @xmath51   , ( 4,1 ) at @xmath52   , ( 2,0 ) at @xmath53   , ( 3,1 ) at @xmath54   , and ( 1,0 ) at @xmath55   .",
    "we have presented three years of photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations , from early 2011 to 2014 , of the light echo of @xmath0  car s 19th century great eruption discovered by r12a .",
    "these observations give us a unique opportunity to study the evolution and physical properties of the ge in detail .",
    "the detection of p - cygni profiles and the observed velocities of the spectral features unambiguously link @xmath0  car s ge to luminous extragalactic transients associated with episodic mass - loss events in massive stars , as has been suggested in previous studies based on its historical light curve and the properties of the homunculus nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the appearance and time evolution of strong triplet , from pure absorption features at peak to p - cygni profiles to emission - dominated profiles at late times , and [ ] forbidden doublet in the spectra of @xmath0  car s light echo resemble the spectral properties and evolution of some type  iin supernovae ( sn  1994w , @xcite ; sn  2011ht , @xcite ) and supernova impostors ( e.g. , ugc  2773-ot , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the time evolution of the line profiles of the le is broadly consistent with an optical depth effect in the ejecta , as seen in type  ii sn .",
    "we can measure the electron density in the line - forming region using the ratio of intensities of the doublet to the triplet @xcite . from the light echo spectra ,",
    "we measure an intensity ratio of @xmath3 , roughly constant at different epochs .",
    "this gives an electron density in the range @xmath56  @xmath57 for @xmath58  k. this high density is consistent with modeling of the spectra of the type  iin sn  1994w @xcite , which also shows a similar spectral evolution in the lines .",
    "however , we do not see in these le spectra the broad h@xmath34 wings produced by electron scattering in type  iin sn .",
    "the comparison to the sn impostor ugc  2773-ot is particularly relevant here because the fwhm of the h@xmath34 line ( @xmath59  km  s@xmath15 ) and its relative strength to the emission @xcite are consistent with the non - detection of broad h@xmath34 features in @xmath0  car s light echo spectra .    despite the similarities between some of the properties of @xmath0  car s le spectra and sn impostors ,",
    "there are important and interesting differences .",
    "as pointed out in r12a , the le spectrum at peak is consistent with cool supergiants with late spectral type g2@xmath12g5 ( @xmath60  k ) .",
    "this is cooler than all the published spectral analysis studies of sn impostors and lbv outbursts to date  k in 2012 @xcite . ] .",
    "the new , late - time spectra of the le ( starting in the spectrum obtained @xmath31  days after peak ) confirm this result .",
    "spectral fitting of the blue part of the spectra using ulyss and cross - correlation with observed spectra of supergiants give @xmath61  k ( rest et al . 2014 , in prep . ) .",
    "furthermore , we detect strong cn molecular bands in the red part of the optical spectra , which are seen in the spectra of cool stars ( e.g. , carbon stars and rsgs ) but are not expected to be formed in warmer stellar photospheres with @xmath62  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this indicates that the spectrum of the le likely becomes cooler after the light curve peak and stays cool at late times .",
    "the cool temperature of the le at peak and at late times after peak are inconsistent with the most simple predictions from the opaque wind model for the ge @xcite , and also very different from s - doradus variations and some lbv giant eruptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the model of the ge as an explosion and interaction with a strong pre - ge wind @xcite appears to be more consistent with our observations .",
    "however , we note that further analysis and spectra of multiple light echoes as a function of time will be needed in order to directly test different ge models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cn features detected in the le spectra at late times are significantly stronger than expected from stellar atmosphere models for rsgs ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we could not find in the literature any observed spectra with stronger features , relative to the continuum , even among the @xmath63 carbon stars identified in sdss ( g.  knapp , private communication ) and also among different types of massive star explosions and outbursts ( sne and sn impostors ) .",
    "this points to an abundance effect , in the sense that the material ejected in the ge is likely significantly rich in nitrogen .",
    "this is consistent with the measured over - abundance of n in the homunculus nebula , derived from ionized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from molecular species ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the spectroscopic evolution of the le",
    ", the observed velocities of the features ( which are consistent with the velocities of the homunculus at similar latitudes presented in @xcite ) , and the strong cn features pointing to n enhancement , suggest that we are seeing ejecta that contributes directly to the homunculus nebula .",
