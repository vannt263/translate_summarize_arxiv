    "one fixes the values of the winding numbers @xmath55 and also the frequency @xmath32 in the ansatz , whereas @xmath56 is obtained from eq .. this method requires a good choice of the starting field configuration .",

    "we find stationary solutions by minimizing the energy for a fixed noether charge @xmath56 . to this end",

    "this guarantees that @xmath16 vanishes at a point @xmath54 corresponding to the center of the closed vortex forming the vorton , and the phase of @xmath16 winds around this point .",
    "it is sufficient to enforce the value of @xmath51 only for the input @xmath138 field configuration , since later it will be automatically preserved in the energy minimizing iterations ( unless the vortex center hits the @xmath65-axis ) , because ` unwinding ' would require an infinite amount of energy .    after fixing @xmath139 in and choosing an input configuration @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath140 with the prescribed value of @xmath51 , the iterative energy minimization produces a sequence of regular , vorton - type configurations .",
    "however , these do not necessarily converge to a smooth limiting configuration , even though the energy is bounded from below .",

    "the variational problem of minimizing is defined for numerical computations by adapting a finite element formulation provided by the freefem++ library @xcite .",
    "the discretization within this formulation is done via a ( homogeneous ) triangulation over @xmath141 , based on the delaunay - voronoi algorithm .",
    "the functions are expanded with respect to a continuous piecewise quadratic polynomial basis on each triangle .",
    "the accuracy of the method is controlled by the number of triangles , by the order of expansion in the basis for each triangle , and also by the order of the quadrature formula for the integral over the triangles .",
    "once the problem is mathematically posed , a numerical optimization algorithm is used to solve the nonlinear variational problem of finding the minima of @xmath80 .",

    "one can consistently set to zero in the field equations the imaginary part of the first scalar and the first gauge field , @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "solutions obtained in this case are similar to the gauged q - balls described in @xcite .",

    "the field @xmath16 is small inside the torus tube , although it does not vanish at the center of the tube as for vortons .",
    "since @xmath16 is real , the first noether current @xmath148 vanishes , and there is no flux of @xmath149 along the torus tube .",
    "however , for q - balls as for vortons , the phase of @xmath17 winds along the torus tube giving rise to an azimuthal current @xmath150 and to a dipole magnetic field @xmath151 . both q - balls and vortons carry an electric charge @xmath74 .      for",
    "a given ( large enough ) charge @xmath56 and an azimuthal winding number @xmath31 , q - balls and vortons have the same angular momentum @xmath147 .",
    "however , their energies @xmath80 are not the same , q - balls being less energetic ( see fig .  [ fig : qball ] ) .",
    "therefore , vortons are not energetically protected from decaying into q - balls , although they can not decay into free particles ( since @xmath152 ) .",
    "the lightest solution for a given @xmath56 is the spherically symmetric q - ball with @xmath153 , but vortons can not decay to it due to the angular momentum conservation , unless they break in several components spiralling around the total center of mass .",
    "it seems this is exactly what happens for the @xmath154 vortons , as described in the main text . specifically , they seem to unwind to @xmath60 via shrinking the @xmath155 line to zero and split into small spherical q - balls whose total orbital angular momentum equals the initial @xmath156 .    however , the @xmath71 vorton is ` hard to pinch ' and it does not break into non - spinning q - balls . on the other hand , it could in principle decay into the @xmath71 spinning q - ball with the same @xmath157 , although their relative energy difference is only @xmath158 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qball ] ) . to unwind to the q - ball",
    ", the vorton has to get rid of the phase winding around the closed line where @xmath155 .",
    "this line can not break , since this would cost an infinite energy , but it can shrink to zero at a finite energy cost . to estimate",
    "the energy needed , we considered an interpolating sequence of trial field configurations for which @xmath2 and @xmath17 are the same as for the @xmath71 stationary vorton , while @xmath159 is replaced by @xmath160 with @xmath161 being the scale parameter .",
    "we then calculate the total energy @xmath162 , which coincides with the vorton energy for @xmath163 .",
    "the @xmath155 line shrinks to zero when @xmath164 , and it turns out that @xmath165 , which gives an idea of the energy needed to unwind . therefore , @xmath71 vortons and q - balls are separated by a potential barrier whose hight is of the same order as the vorton energy . since vortons are rather heavy , a very strong perturbation is needed to unwind them into q - balls . as mentioned in the main text , the vorton unwinding",
    "could also be disfavoured by quantum effects .        to investigate the dynamical stability of the global vortons ,",

[ fig : domain ] are interpolated to adapt them to a 3d mesh built via a 3d triangulation over the 3d integration region .",
    "the two meshes are completely different and have neither common symmetries nor shared vertices .",

    "<S> interestingly , a very similar conclusion was made for the ` spinning light bullets ' which share many properties with vortons @xcite . these are non - relativistic solutions for a complex scalar field with a @xmath97-dependent phase ( like for @xmath17 ) , and they also have toroidal profiles . their @xmath98 dependence is similar to that shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : curve1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the @xmath71 solutions with a large charge and @xmath32 close to @xmath99 preserve their shape in the @xmath1 dynamical evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> exactly the same statement applies for our relativistic vortons .    in summary , for the first time since the vortons were heuristically described almost 25 year ago @xcite , we present the underlying stable solutions within the @xmath0 gauge field theory of witten @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can now make some estimates . assuming the original motivation of witten , the energy scale should be of the gut magnitude , @xmath100 gev . using the value @xmath101 for estimates </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that vortons are extremely heavy , with @xmath102 gev , which is not far from the planck energy . on the other hand , their minimal noether charge @xmath103 </S>",
    "<S> is actually not so large as compared to the average particle density in the hot early universe . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , vortons could be abundantly created due to charge fluctuations in the course of a phase transition via the kibble mechanism @xcite , if only guts indeed applied in the past . being classically stable , vortons could disintegrate via a quantum tunnelling towards the @xmath104 state , but this process should be exponentially suppressed , and in fact quantum fluctuations can also have a stabilizing effect by preventing the collapse to zero size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vortons could probably evaporate via interactions with gut fermions @xcite , but this process should stop after the gut epoch . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is not inconceivable that some relic vortons could still be around and contribute to dark matter </S>",
    "<S> .    let us consider @xmath82 vortons . </S>",
    "<S> for stationary fields , eqs . for @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> can formally be interpreted @xcite as the non - relativistic gross - pitaevskii equation for a two - component bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can describe ultracold atomic gazes with two hyperfine states , such as @xmath105rb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> scalars @xmath3 then correspond to the two bec order parameters , one of which creates a vortex while the other one condenses in the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> our solutions therefore describe stationary vortons made of loops of such vortices , whose potential existence has been much discussed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , vortex rings in two - component becs have been observed experimentally @xcite , although it is not completely clear if they support an angular momentum @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 and @xmath17 can also be interpreted @xcite , respectively , as the @xmath106-wave superconducting ( dsc ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) order parameters in the so(5 ) model of high @xmath107 superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model admits dsc vortices with an af core @xcite , while our solutions describe loops made of these vortices . </S>",
    "<S> such vorton quasiparticles could be important for the superconducting phase transition in this model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> equally , scalars @xmath3 can be viewed as describing a condensate of @xmath108 mesons in qcd @xcite , hence our solutions describe the @xmath109-vortons , whose existence was conjectured in @xcite . setting the scale to be @xmath110 mev gives for their energy @xmath111 tev . </S>",
    "<S> such objects could probably exist in dense qcd matter , as for example in neutron stars @xcite , which may affect their electromagnetic and neutrino transport properties .    </S>",
