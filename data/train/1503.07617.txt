    "the main purpose of this paper is to deepen the study of qualitative theory of differential equations induced by differentiable vector fields of the plane which are not necessarily of class @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , problems addressed in @xcite include global injectivity , uniqueness of solutions and asymptotic stability of the point at infinity of the riemann sphere @xmath1 .",
    "these works , like many others in the literature , extend to the differentiable case previous results concerning @xmath2vector fields .",
    "thus , the present paper pretends to extend to the differentiable case the work in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite guarantee the change of stability at infinity of a one  parameter family of @xmath2vector fields as the parameter goes through zero .",
    "this behaviour was presented as hopf bifurcation at infinity .",
    "before @xcite the study of hopf bifurcation at infinity had been approached only from two points of view .",
    "one deals with families which have finitely many parameters and are made up of continuous perturbations of linear systems .",
    "the other point of view deals with polynomial families .",
    "the former case uses the strong domination imposed by the linear part of the vector field on the continuous nonlinear term , which can have sub  linear growth @xcite .",
    "the later point of view involves standard poincar compactification @xcite .",
    "both points of view are related to the existence of limit cycles of arbitrarily large amplitudes .",
    "particularly , the case of polynomial systems can be associated to the sixteenth hilbert problem , see for instance @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a different point of view was given in @xcite , where the authors are only interested in the change of stability at infinity .",
    "this point of view has been strongly articulated in other works related to planar systems induced by differentiable vector fields @xcite .",
    "the main motivation of this approach was the definition of hopf bifurcation at infinity given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "concretely , it is said in @xcite that the polynomial family of vector fields @xmath3 presents a hopf bifurcation at infinity when @xmath4 cross @xmath5 if the infinity changes its stability .    the paper @xcite deals with a class of one  parameter family @xmath6 of planar @xmath0 vector fields defined on the complement of an open ball centered at origin which are also free of singularities .",
    "the authors find the change of stability at infinity when the sign of @xmath7 varies as the parameter crosses zero . in the context of @xcite",
    ", @xmath8 is any @xmath2 extension of @xmath9 with divergence lebesgue almost ",
    "integrable ( see section [ sec_prelim ] for details ) .",
    "the families considered in @xcite are neither polynomial nor a perturbation of linear systems , consequently the work in @xcite contains the two point of view described above .",
    "we consider a one  parameter family @xmath10 , where @xmath11 has isolated singularities and belongs to a class of differentiable ( not necessarily of class @xmath0 ) planar vector fields defined on the complement of some compact ball centered at the origin .",
    "the main motivation to address the existence of hopf bifurcation at infinity for this family is the work given in @xcite and @xcite . in those papers the authors prove the uniqueness of the positive trajectory starting at every point @xmath12 due some conditions on the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix of the differentiable vector field .",
    "in addition , results in @xcite allow us to focus on the integral @xmath13 in order to find a change of stability at infinity . in this context , since the qualitative change at infinity of the family @xmath10 may be exhibit from global extensions @xmath14 , the main obstruction to describe the bifurcation is the existence of unbounded sequences of singular points .",
    "in order to avoid this phenomenon , we impose some extra condition on the extension @xmath15 which imply that every vector field of the family induces an injective map .",
    "consequently , every vector field of the family has at most one singular point in the plane .",
    "observe that the one ",
    "parameter family considered in this paper is not necessarily a perturbation of linear systems in the sense of @xcite .",
    "moreover , complements the results presented in  @xcite for @xmath2vector fields because in our work the existence of isolated singularities of @xmath11 is allowed .",
    "let @xmath16 be the compact ball bounded by @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and suppose that @xmath19 is a differentiable vector field , defined on the complement of @xmath20 on @xmath21 . here , the term differentiable means _",
    "frechet differentiable _ at each point @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the respective derivative .",
    "this derivative is defined as the bounded linear operator induced by the standard jacobian matrix at @xmath24 .",
    "this matrix is denoted by @xmath25 , so @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the typical jacobian determinant and divergence , respectively . on the other hand , if the point @xmath28 is kept fixed , then a _ trajectory _ of @xmath11 starting at @xmath29 is defined as the integral curve @xmath30 , determined by a maximal solution of the initial value problem @xmath31 .",
    "of course , it means that @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in this context , it is useful to have a term that refers to the image of the solution .",
    "hence , we define the _ orbit _ of @xmath34 to be the set @xmath35 , and we identify the trajectory with its orbit . similarly , @xmath36 and @xmath37\\cap i_q\\}$ ] are the _ semi  trajectories _ of @xmath11 , and",
    "they are called _ positive _ and _ negative _ , respectively . in consequence , @xmath38 , and each trajectory has its two limit sets , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "these limit sets are well defined in the sense that they only depend on the respective solution . and",
    "lastly , such a vector field induces a well defined _ positive semi  flow _",
    "( respectively _ negative semi  flow _ ) , if the condition @xmath28 implies the existence and uniqueness of @xmath41 ( respectively @xmath42 ) .",
    "the trajectories of a vector field may be unbounded .",
    "one way to obtain some information about the behavior of such solutions is to compactify the plane , so that the vector field is extended to a new manifold that contains the points at infinity . in this context",
    ", the so called alexandroff compactification has been most successful in the study of planar systems induced by @xmath0-vector fields , not necessarily polynomial ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "to describe the results , @xmath21 is embedded in the riemann sphere @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , @xmath44 is the subspace of @xmath43 with the induced topology , and infinity  refers to the point @xmath45 of @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , a vector field @xmath46 ( without singularities ) can be extended to a map @xmath47 ( which takes @xmath45 to @xmath5 ) . in this manner ,",
    "all questions concerning the local theory of isolated singularities of planar vector fields can be formulated and examined in the case of the extended vector field @xmath48 , which coincides with @xmath11 on @xmath49 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath50 is an unbounded semi  trajectory of @xmath51 with empty @xmath52limit set , then we declare that @xmath53 _ goes to infinity _ , and we write @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , @xmath55 denotes that @xmath56 _ comes from infinity _ , and it means that @xmath57 is an unbounded semi  trajectory whose @xmath58limit set is empty . therefore , it is also possible to talk about the phase portrait of @xmath11 in a neighborhood of @xmath45 , as shown @xcite .    throughout this paper , given @xmath59 , a closed ( compact , no boundary ) curve ( @xmath60manifold ) , @xmath61 ( respectively @xmath62 ) denotes the compact disc ( respectively open disc ) bounded by @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the boundaries @xmath64 and @xmath65 are equal to @xmath63 besides homeomorphic to the circle @xmath66 .",
    "the index at infinity was defined firstly for @xmath2vector fields in @xcite and lately in @xcite for differentiable vector fields ( not necessarily of class @xmath0 ) .",
    "the relationship between this index and the stability of the point at infinity of the vector field is also stated in those works in both cases .",
    "consider @xmath51 be a differentiable vector field .",
    "the _ index of @xmath11 at infinity _ , denoted by @xmath67 , is the number of the extended line @xmath68 $ ] given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a global differentiable vector field such that :    * in some @xmath71 with @xmath72 , both @xmath11 and @xmath73 coincide . * @xmath74 is lebesgue almost ",
