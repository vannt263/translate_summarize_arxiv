    "sigmoidal input - output response modules are very well - conserved in cell signaling networks that might be used to implement binary responses , a key element in cellular decision processes .",
    "additionally , sigmoidal modules might be part of more complex structures , where they can provide the nonlinearities which are needed in a broad spectrum of biological processes [ 1,2 ] , such as multistability [ 3,4 ] , adaptation [ 5 ] , and oscillations [ 6 ] .",
    "there are several molecular mechanisms that are able to produce sigmoidal responses such as inhibition by a titration process [ 7,8 ] , zero - order ultrasensitivity in covalent cycles [ 9,10 ] , and multistep activation processes - like multisite phosphorylation [ 11 - 13 ] or ligand binding to multimeric receptors [ 14 ] .",
    "sigmoidal curves are characterized by a sharp transition from low to high output following a slight change of the input .",
    "the steepness of this transition is called ultrasensitivity [ 15 ] . in general",
    ", the following operational definition of the hill coefficient may be used to calculate the overall ultrasensitivity of sigmoidal modules :    @xmath0    where ec10 and ec90 are the signal values needed to produce an output of 10% and 90% of the maximal response .",
    "the hill coefficient @xmath1 quantifies the steepness of a function relative to the hyperbolic response function which is defined as not ultrasensitive and has @xmath2 ( i.e. an 81-fold increase in the input signal is required to change the output level from 10% to 90% of its maximal value ) .",
    "functions with @xmath3 need a smaller input fold increase to produce such output change , and are thus called ultrasensitive functions .",
    "global sensitivity measures such the one described by eq .",
    "1 do not fully characterize s - shaped curves , y(x ) , because they average out local characteristics of the analyzed response functions . instead , these local features are well captured by the logarithmic gain or response coefficient measure [ 16 ] defined as : equation 2 provides local ultrasensitivity estimates given by the local polynomial order of the response function .    @xmath4    equation 2 provides local ultrasensitivity estimates given by the local polynomial order of the response function .",
    "mitogen activated protein ( map ) kinase cascades are a well - conserved motif .",
    "they can be found in a broad variety of cell fate decision systems involving processes such as proliferation , differentiation , survival , development , stress response and apoptosis [ 17 ] .",
    "they are composed of a chain of three kinases which sequentially activate one another , through single or multiple phosphorylation events .",
    "a thoughtful experimental and mathematical study of this kind of systems was performed by ferrell and collaborators , who analyzed the steady - state response of a mapk cascade that operates during the maturation process in xenopus oocytes [ 18 ] .",
    "they developed a biochemical model to study the ultrasensitivity displayed along the cascade levels and reported that the combination of the different ultrasensitive layers in a multilayer structure produced an enhancement of the overall system s global ultrasensitivity [ 18 ] .",
    "in the same line , brown et al .",
    "[ 19 ] showed that if the dose - response curve , f(x ) , of a cascade could be described as the mathematical composition of functions , fisi , that described the behavior of each layer in isolation ( i.e , @xmath5 then the local ultrasensitivity of the different layers combines multiplicatively : @xmath6 . in connection with this result ,",
    "ferrell showed for hill - type modules of the form    @xmath7    where the parameter ec50 corresponds to the value of input that elicits half - maximal output , and nh is the hill coefficient ) , that the overall cascade global ultrasensitivity had to be less than or equal to the product of the global ultrasensitivity estimations of each cascade s layer , i.e @xmath8 [ 20 ] .    hill functions of the form given by eq .",
    "3 are normally used as empirical approximations of sigmoidal dose - response curves , even in the absence of any mechanistic foundation [ 2 ] .",
    "however , it is worth noting that for different and more specific sigmoidal transfer functions , qualitatively different results could have been obtained .",
    "in particular , a supra - multiplicative behavior ( the ultrasensitivity of the combination of layers is higher than the product of individual ultrasensitivities ) might be observed for left - ultrasensitive response functions , i.e. functions that are steeper to the left of the ec50 than to the right [ 21 ] ) . in this case , the boost in the ultrasensitivity emerges from a better exploitation of the ultrasensitivity `` stored '' in the asymmetries of the dose - response functional form ( see [ 21 ] for details ) .",
    "as modules are embedded in bigger networks , constraints in the range of inputs that each module would receive ( as well as in the range of outputs that the network would be able to transmit ) could arise .",
    "we formalized this idea in a recent publication introducing the notion of dynamic range constraint of a module s dose - response function .",
    "the later concept is a feature inherently linked to the coupling of modules in a multilayer structure , and resulted a significant element to explain the overall ultrasensitivity displayed by a cascade [ 21 ] . besides dynamic range constraint effects sequestration - i.e.",
    ", the reduction in free active enzyme due to its accumulation in complex with its substrate- is another relevant process inherent to cascading that could reduce the cascade s ultrasensitivity [ 22 - 24 ] .",
    "moreover , sequestration may alter the qualitative features of any well - characterized module when integrated with upstream and downstream components , thereby limiting the validity of module - based descriptions [ 25 - 27 ] .",
    "all these considerations expose the relevance of studying the behavior of modular processing units embedded in their physiological context .",
    "although there has been significant progress in the understanding of kinase cascades , how the combination of layers affects the cascade s ultrasensitivity remains an open - ended question for the general case .",
    "sequestration and dynamic range constraints not only contribute with their individual complexity , but also usually occur together , thus making it more difficult to identify their individual effective contribution to the system s overall ultrasensitivity .    in the present work ,",
    "we have developed a method to describe the overall ultrasensitivity of a molecular cascade in terms of the effective contribution of each module .",
    "in addition , said method allows us to disentangle the effects of sequestration and dynamic range constraints .",
    "we used our approach to analyze a recently presented synthetic mapk cascade experimentally engineered by oshaughnessy et al .",
    "[ 28 ] .    using a synthetic biology approach oshaughnessy et al .",
    "[ 28 ] constructed an isolated mammalian mapk cascade ( a raf - mek - erk system ) in yeast and analyzed its information processing capabilities under different rather well - controlled environmental conditions .",
    "they made use of a mechanistic mathematical description to account for their experimental observations .",
    "their model was very similar in spirit to huang - ferrell s with two important differences : a ) no phosphatases were included , and b ) the creation and degradation of all species was explicitly taken into account .",
    "interestingly , they reported that the multilayer structure of the analyzed cascades can accumulate ultrasensitivity supra - multiplicatively , and suggested that cascading itself and not any other process ( such as multi - step phosphorylation , or zero - order ultrasensitivity ) was at the origin of the observed ultrasensitivity .",
    "they called this mechanism , de - novo ultrasensitivity generation .",
    "as we found the proposed mechanism a rather appealing and unexpected way of ultrasensitivity generation , we wanted to further characterize it within our analysis framework .",
    "in particular , we reasoned that the methodology and concepts introduced in the present contribution were particularly well - suited to understand the mechanisms laying behind the ultrasensitivity behavior displayed by oshaughnessy cascade model .",
    "the paper was organized as follows .",
    "first , we presented a formal connection between local and global descriptors of a module s ultrasensitivity for the case of a cascade system composed of @xmath9 units .",
    "we then introduced the notion of hill input s working range in order to analyze the contribution to the overall system s ultrasensitivity of a module embedded in a cascade .",
    "next , we presented the oshaughnessy cascade analysis , in order to show the insights that might be gained using the introduced concepts and analysis methodologies .",
    "we concluded by presenting a summarizing discussion after which conclusions were drawn .",
    "the concept of ultrasensitivity describes a module s ability to amplify small changes in input values into larger changes in output values .",
    "it is customary to quantify and characterize the extent of the amplification both globally , using the hill coefficient @xmath1 defined in equation 1 , and locally , using the response coefficient , r(i ) , as a function of the module s input signal i ( equation 2 ) , we found a simple relationship between both descriptions considering the logarithmic amplification coefficient @xmath10 , defined as :    @xmath11    @xmath10 describes ( in a logarithmic scale ) the change produced in the output when the input varies from a to b values .",
    "for instance , @xmath12 for an hyperbolic function evaluated between the inputs that resulted in 90% and 10% of the maximal output . in this case , the two considered input levels delimited the input range that should be considered for the estimation of the respective hill coefficient @xmath1 . , we called this input interval : the hill input s working range ( see fig 1a - b ) .    ) , and the `` hill working range '' is the input range relevant for the calculation of the system s @xmath13 . in hill functions , inputs values much smaller than its ec50 produce local sensitivities around its hill coefficient.schematic response function diagrams for the composition of two hill type ultrasensitive modules ( d - e ) .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the input values that take the `` i '' module when the last module ( the second one ) reach the % 10 and % 90 of it maximal output ( @xmath16 ) . when @xmath17(d ) @xmath16 equals the maximum output of module 2 in isolation , thus , @xmath18 and @xmath19 match the ec10 and ec90 of module 2 in isolation .",
    "also the hill working range of module 1 is located in the input region below ec501 . on the other hand , when @xmath20 ( e ) @xmath16 is less than the maximum output of module 2 in isolation , thus , @xmath18 and @xmath19 differ from the ec10 and ec90 of module 2 in isolation . in this case",
    "the modules-1 hill working range tends to be centered in values higher than its ec50 , this will depends on modules-2 ultrasensitivity ( see supplementary materials [ sm1]),scaledwidth=100.0% ]    [ fig1 ]    taking into account eq . ( 4 ) , the parameter @xmath1 could be rewritten as follows , @xmath21    consequently , the hill coefficient could be interpreted as the ratio of the logarithmic amplification coefficients of the function of interest and an hyperbolic function , evaluated in the corresponding hill input s working range .",
    "it is worth noting that the logarithmic amplification coefficient that appeared in equation 5 equaled the slope of the line that passed through the points @xmath22 and @xmath23 in a log - log scale .",
    "thus , it was equal to the average response coefficient calculated over the interval @xmath24 $ ] in logarithmic scale ( see fig 1c ) . therefore ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 denoted the mean value of the variable x over the range [ a , b ] .",
    "this last equation explicitly linked the local and global ultrasensitivity descriptions .",
    "in particular , it can be appreciated that the module s hill coefficient was related to the average response coefficient over the module s hill input s working range , in units of a reference hyperbolic curve .",
    "we generalized the last result to cast the overall global ultrasensitivity level of a multitier cascade in terms of logarithmic amplification coefficients .",
    "we proceeded by first considering two coupled ultrasensitive modules , disregarding effects of sequestration of molecular components between layers . in this case , the expression for the system s dose - response curve , @xmath27 , results from the mathematical composition of the functions , @xmath28 , which describe the input / output relationship of isolated modules @xmath29 :    @xmath30    using eq .",
    "5 , the system s hill coefficient @xmath1 resulted :    @xmath31    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 delimited the hill input s working range of the composite system , i.e. the input values for the i - layer so that the last layer ( corresponding to i=2 in this case ) reached the 10% and 90% of it maximal output level , respectively ( see fig 1d-1e ) .",
    "it followed from equation 8 that the system s hill coefficient nh could be written as the product of two factors , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which characterized local average sensitivities over the relevant input region for each layer : @xmath34 $ ] , with @xmath29 ( see fig 1d - e ) .",
    "the factor @xmath33 in equation 8 was formally equivalent to the hill coefficient of layer-2 but , importantly , now it was calculated using layer-1 hill input s working range limits , x101 and x901 , instead of the hill working range limits of layer-1 in isolation , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . on the other hand , @xmath32 was the amplification factor @xmath37 that logarithmically scaled the range @xmath38 $ ] into @xmath39 $ ] . in this context , we dubbed the @xmath40 coefficient : effective ultrasensitivity coefficient of layer - i , as it was associated to the effective contribution of layer - i to the system s overall ultrasensitivity .    for the more general case of a cascade of @xmath9 modules we found that :    @xmath41    this last equation , which hold exactly , showed a very general result . for the general case , the overall @xmath1 of a cascade could be understood as a multiplicative combination of the @xmath40 of each module .",
    "the connection between the global and local ultrasensitivity descriptors , provided by equation 9 , proved to be a useful tool to analyze ultrasensitivity in cascades , as it allowed assessing the effective contribution of each module to the system s overall ultrasensitivity .    according to this equation , hill input s working range designated regions of inputs over which the mean local - ultrasensitivity value was calculated for each cascade level in order to set the system s @xmath1 .",
    "it was thus a significant parameter to characterize the overall ultrasensitivity of multilayer structures . in figures 1d-1e we illustrated , for the case of two composed hill functions , to what extent the actual location of these relevant intervals depended on the way in which the cascade layers were coupled .",
    "the ratio between @xmath42 and @xmath43 played a key role at this respect ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "we showed how this parameter sets the hill working ranges for the case of modules presenting different dose - response curves in sup mat .",
    "importantly this analysis highlighted the impact of the detailed functional form of a module s response curve on the overall system s ultrasensitivity in cascade architectures .",
    "local sensitivity features of the involved transfer functions were of the uttermost importance in this kind of setting and could be at the core of non - trivial phenomenology . for example a dose - response module with larger local ultrasensitivities than its overall global value might contribute with more ultrasensitivity to the system than the function s own @xmath1 ( see sup.mat .",
    "[ sm1 ] ) .      in order to disentangle the different factors contributing to a cascade overall ultrasensitivity , we simultaneously considered three approximations of the system under study ( see fig 2 ) . in a first step ( fig 2a ) we numerically computed the transfer function , @xmath44 , of each module in isolation and calculated the respective hill coefficients @xmath45 .    )",
    "can be obtain by the mathematical composition of each module s transfer functions @xmath46 acting in isolation ( b ) . when the sequestration effect is taken into account",
    ", the layers embedded in the map kinase cascade may have a different dose - response curve from the isolated case ( c).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    [ fig2 ]    we then studied the mathematical composition , @xmath47 , of the isolated response functions ( fig 2b ) :    @xmath48    @xmath47 represented the transfer function of the kinase cascade when sequestration effects were completely neglected .",
    "following equation 9 effective ultrasensitivities , @xmath49 could be estimated and compared against the global ultrasensitivity that each module displayed in isolation , .",
    "thus , this second step aimed to specifically analyze to what extent the existence of _ hill s input working ranges _ impinged on ultrasensitivity features display by cascade arrangement of layers ( fig 2b ) .",
    "finally , in a third step , response functions were obtained considering a mechanistic model of the cascade .",
    "effective ultrasensitivity coefficients , @xmath50 , could then be estimated for each module in order to asses for putative sequestration effects that could take place in the system ( fig 2c ) .      a sketch of the oshaughnessy et al .",
    "mapk cascade is shown in fig 3a . in our analysis , we defined the output of a module and the input to the next one as the total active form of a species , including complexes with the next layer s substrates .",
    "however , we excluded complexes formed by same layer components ( such as a complex between the phosphorylated kinase and its phosphatase ) , since these species are `` internal '' to each module . by doing this ,",
    "we are able to consistently identify layers with modules ( the same input / output definition was used by ventura _ et al _ [ 25 ] ) .",
    "[ fig3 ]    in order to study the contribution of each layer to the system s ultrasensitivity , we proceeded to numerically compute the transfer function of each module in isolation and then calculate their respective @xmath51 ( column 2 in table 1 ) .",

    "the reason is that even the dose - response of active mek and the hill function appear to be similar , there are strong dissimilarities in their local ultrasensitivity behavior ( see fig 5b ) .",
    "this is particularly true for low input values , where the hill s input working range is located . in this region ,",
    "the active mek curve presents local ultrasensitivity values larger than the hill function counterpart , thus the replacement by a hill function produce a reduction in the hill coefficient in this way , despite the high - quality of the fitting adjustment residual standard error=2.6 ) , the hill function approximation introduced non - trivial alterations in the system s ultrasensitivity as a technical glitch .",
    "there have been early efforts to interpret cascade system - level ultrasensitivity out of the sigmoidal character of their constituent modular components .",
    "usually they have focused either on a local or a global characterization of ultrasensitivity features .",
    "for instance , brown et al . [ 19 ] had shown that the local system s ultrasensitivity in cascades equals the product of the local ultrasensitivity of each layer . in turn , from a global ultrasensitivity perspective , ferrell [ 20 ] pointed out that in the composition of two hill functions , the hill coefficient results equal or less than the product of the hill coefficient of both curves ( @xmath52 ) .    in this contribution",
    "we have found a mathematical expression ( equation 6 ) that linked both , the local and global ultrasensitivity descriptors in a fairly simple way . moreover",
    "we could provide a generalized result to handle the case of a linear arrangement of an arbitrary number of such modules ( equation 9 ) .",
    "noticeably , within the proposed analysis framework , we could decompose the overall global ultrasensitivity in terms of a product of single layer effective ultrasensitivities .",
    "these new parameters were calculated as local - ultrasensitivity values averaged over meaningful working ranges ( dubbed _ hill s input working ranges _ ) , and permitted to assess the effective contribution of each module to the system s overall ultrasensitivity .",
    "of course , the reason why we could state an exact general equation for a system - level feature in terms of individual modular information was that in fact system - level information was used in the definition of the _ hill s input working ranges _ that entered equation 9 .",
    "the specific coupling between ultrasensitive curves , set the corresponding _",
    "hill s input working ranges _ , thus determining the effective contribution of each module to the cascade s ultrasensitivity",
    ". this process , which we called _",
    "hill s input working range setting _ , has already been noticed by several authors [ 20 , 29,30 , 23 ] , but as far as we know this was the first time that a mathematical framework , like the one we present here , has been proposed for it .",
    "the value of the obtained expression ( equation 9 ) resides in the fact that not only it captured previous results , like ferrell s inequality , but also that it threw light about the mechanisms involved in the ultrasensitivity generation .",
    "for instance , the existence of supramultiplicative behavior in signaling cascades have been reported by several authors [ 23 , 28 ] but in many cases the ultimate origin of supramultiplicativity remained elusive .",
    "our framework naturally suggested a general scenario where supramultiplicative behavior could take place .",
    "this could occur when , for a given module , the corresponding _",
    "s input working range _ was located in an input region with local ultrasensitivities higher than the global ultrasensitivity of the respective dose - response curve .    in order to study how multiple ultrasensitive modules combined to produce an enhancement of the system s ultrasensitivity , we have developed an analysis methodology that allowed us to quantify the effective contribution of each module to the cascade s ultrasensitivity and to determine the impact of sequestration effects in the system s ultrasensitivity .",
    "this method was particularly well suited to study the ultrasensitivity in map kinase cascades .",
    "we used our methodology to revisit oshaughnessy et al .",
    "tunable synthetic mapk system [ 28 ] in which they claim to have found a new source of ultrasensitivity called : _ de novo _ ultrasensitivity generation .",
    "they explained this new effect in terms of the presence of intermediate elements in the kinase - cascade architecture .",
    "we started analyzing the mapk cascade .",
    "we found that sequestration was not affecting the system s ultrasensitivity and that the overall sub - multiplicative behavior was only due to a re - setting of the hill input s working range for the first and second levels of the cascade .",
    "then , to investigate the origin of the claimed _ de novo _ ultrasensitivity generation mechanism , we applied our framework on the single - step phosphorylation cascade .",
    "we found that the system s ultrasensitivity in the single - step cascade came only from the contribution of the last module , which behaved as a goldbeter - koshland unit with kinases working in saturation and phosphatases in a linear regime .",
    "therefore the ultrasensitivity in its single - step cascade was not generated by the cascading itself , but by the third layer , which itself was actually ultrasensitive .",
    "finally we analyzed the auxiliary model considered by oshaughnessy et al .",
    "in which the raf and mek layers were replaced by a hill function that is coupled to the erk layer . in this case , , even the original estradiol - mek input - output response curve could be fairly well fitted and global ultrasensitivity features were rather well captured , the replacement by a hill function produce a strong decrease in the systems ultrasensitivity .",
    "we found that the functional form of the hill function failed to reproduce original local ultrasensitivity features that were in fact the ones that , due to the particular hill working range setting acting in this case , were responsible for the overall systems ultrasensitivity behavior .",
    "the analyzed case was particularly relevant , as provided an illustrative example that warned against possible technical glitches that could arise as a consequence of the inclusion of approximating functions in mapk models .",
    "the study of signal transmission and information processing inside the cell has been , and still is , an active field of research . in particular , the analysis of cascades of sigmoidal modules has received a lot of attention as they are well - conserved motifs that can be found in many cell fate decision systems . in the present contribution we focused on the analysis of the ultrasensitive character of this kind of molecular systems .",
    "we presented a mathematical link between global and local characterizations of the ultrasensitive nature of a sigmoidal unit and generalized this result to handle the case of a linear arrangement of such modules . in this way",
    ", the overall system ultrasensitivity could define in terms of the effective contribution of each cascade tier . based on our finding , we proposed a methodological procedure to analyzed cascade modular systems , in particular mapk cascades .",
    "we used our methodology to revisit oshaughnessy et al .",

    "in which they claim to find a new source of ultrasensitivity called : _ de novo _ ultrasensitivity generation , which they explained in terms of the presence of intermediate elements in the kinase - cascade architecture . with our framework",
    "we found that the ultrasensitivity did not come from a cascading effect but from a ` hidden ' first - order ultrasensitivity process in the one of the cascade s layer .    from a general perspective",
    ", our framework serves to understand the origin of ultrasensitivity in multilayer structures , which could be a powerful tool in the designing of synthetic systems .",
    "in particular , in ultrasensitive module designing , our method can be used to guide the tuning of both the module itself and the coupling with the system , in order to set the working range in the region of maximal local ultrasensitivity .",

    "the _ hill s input working range _ delimits the region of inputs over which the mean local - ultrasensitivity value is calculated ( equation 9 ) .",
    "it is thus a significant parameter to get insights about the overall ultrasensitivity of multilayer structures . in what follows ,",
    "we show that the actual location of this relevant interval depends on the way in which cascade layers are coupled .",
    "let s start by considering two coupled ultrasensitive modules .",
    "two different regimes could be identified depending whether the upstream module s maximum output was or was nt large enough to fully activate the downstream unit :    a.   in the first case i.e. when @xmath20 ( see fig 1d ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are equal to the @xmath53 and @xmath54 levels respectively .",
    "therefore , when coupled to module-1 , the hill input s working range of module-2 would not differ from the isolated case , and would equal the hill coefficient of this module acting in isolation : i.e @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , it can be seen that the hill input s working range of module-1 tends to be located at the low input - values region for increasing levels of the ratio @xmath56 . in this region the response coefficient of the hill functions achieve the highest values , with @xmath57 ( see fig 1c ) , thus , when calculating the average logarithmic gain , @xmath58 , we would obtain @xmath59 .",
    "finally , following equation 8 we get @xmath60 .",
    "it can be seen that the cascade behaves multiplicatively in this regime , which is consistent with ferrell s results [ 1 ] b.   when the upstream module s maximal output is not enough to fully activate the downstream module , i.e. @xmath62 we will have different behaviors depending on module-2 ultrasensitivity :    first let s see what happens in a case in which module-2 dose - response has @xmath63 , thus displaying a linear behavior at low input values ( see fig 6 ) .",
    "[ figs1 ]    the linearity produces that @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the linear curve ) match the % 10 and % 90 of @xmath66 , thus @xmath67 and @xmath68 coincide with @xmath35 and @xmath36 centering the hill working range around @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , as a result of applying equation 4 , the system s behavior lies on module-1 and shows a multiplicative behavior , given the linearity of module-2 .",
    "@xmath70    on the other hand , it can be seen that if @xmath71 , then module-2 dose response has a power - law behavior at low input values ( see fig 6 ) . in this case , the non - linearity produces a shift in modules-2 working range toward higher values , which centers modules-1 hill working range in input values higher than @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , given that @xmath58 decreases with @xmath72 , the modules-1 working range shift produces @xmath73 , then ,    @xmath74    finally we get that if @xmath20 and @xmath75 , the system shows a submultiplicative behavior ( consistent with ferrell s results [ 20 ] ) , which arises from a setting of modules-1 working range in a region with low local ultrasensitivity .",
    "although we show that the submultiplicativity occurs in the limit of @xmath20 , the same argument is still valid for @xmath62 .    of course",
    ", the ultimate consequences in the coupling of two ultrasensitive modules will depend on the particular mathematical details of the transfer functions under consideration . in this way",
    ", a completely qualitatively different behavior could be found for a system composed of two modules characterized by golbeter - koshland , gk , response functions [ 2 ] .",
    "gk functions appear in the mathematical characterization of covalent modification cycles ( such as phosphorylation - dephosphorylation ) , ubiquitous in cell signaling , operating in saturation . for cases where the phosphatases , but not the kinases , work in saturation , gk functions present input regions with response coefficients higher than their overall @xmath1 ( see fig 2a - c ) .",
    "their _ hill input s working range _ are thus located in the region of greatest local ultrasensitivity , these functions are able to contribute with more effective ultrasensitivity than their global ultrasensitivity .",
    "therefore , cascades involving gk functions may exhibit supra - multiplicative behavior . for this kind of systems",
    ", fig 2d shows that , under regime ( a ) ( when the modules-2 ec50 is much lower than the gk maximal output level , o1 max ) the modules-1 hill input s working range is set in its linear regime ( @xmath76 ) , and the gk function does not contribute to the overall system s ultrasensitivity . on the other hand , fig 2e shows that the @xmath42 to @xmath43 relation can be tuned in order to set modules-1 hill input s working range in its most ultrasensitive region , producing an effective ultrasensitivity contribution , @xmath33 , even larger than the ultrasensitivity of the gk curve in isolation ( i.e. @xmath77 ) , resulting in supra - multiplicative behavior @xmath78 .",
    "our analysis highlights the impact of the detailed functional form of a module s response curve on the overall system s ultrasensitivity in cascade architectures .",
