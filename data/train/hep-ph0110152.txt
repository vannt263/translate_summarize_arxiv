    "in this paper we will study from empirical point of view the existing world data for one measured spin - dependent quantity ( analyzing power ) in collisions of unpolarized hadrons with polarized protons and antiprotons . the analyzing power ( @xmath6 ) , which is often called single - spin asymmetry ,",
    "should be distinguished from a raw asymmetry ( @xmath7 ) , which is directly measured in experiments and depends on a beam ( or target ) polarization @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and a dilution factor @xmath10 . for polarized beam experiments @xmath11 , and for polarized target experiments @xmath12 .    practically all existing data",
    "( with @xmath13 gev / c ) at intermediate and high energies are used for the analysis .",
    "comparison of the fermilab data @xcite , measured at 200 gev / c with new 40 gev / c ihep polarized beam data @xcite was an important step in the revelation of scaling features of the analyzing power .",
    "the data measured with meson beams using polarized targets @xcite are just briefly explored here .",
    "the important investigations in this field were done at the ihep and other accelerators and merit probably a dedicated paper .",
    "recent measurements have shown that at high enough energies the analyzing power for inclusive production of hadrons in reactions @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are hadrons , is large and described by a simple function of kinematic variables and shows an approximate scaling in @xmath18 for fragmentation region of vertically polarized protons and a scaling in @xmath19 for central region @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is larger in the fragmentation region of polarized protons ( antiprotons ) then in the central region .",
    "some authors have assumed , that for the analyzing powers a radial scaling takes place ( @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "however , as will be shown below , this assumption has not been confirmed .",
    "the purpose of this study is to find a suitable scaling variable , that allows one to describe in a unified way the dependence of analyzing powers on kinematic variables in a wide range of beam energies , transverse momenta , and angles of particle production .",
    "a thorough study of the existing data has shown that the analyzing power for the inclusive @xmath21-meson production in @xmath22 collisions has the following features @xcite :    * the scaling and linear dependence on @xmath23 or @xmath24 in the region of polarized proton fragmentation or in the central region , respectively ; * the analyzing power maximum in the fragmentation region ( near @xmath23=1 ) is approximately two times higher than it is in the central region ( near @xmath24=1 ) ; * the analyzing power changes its sign ( or is zero ) in the polarized proton fragmentation region at @xmath23 near 0.18 , whereas in the central region it takes place at @xmath24 near 0.37 , which is approximately two times higher ; * the analyzing power grows with @xmath1 rise at fixed @xmath23 , has a plateau above 1 gev / c , and probably decreases when @xmath1 gets much higher 1 gev / c ; * the analyzing power is zero at @xmath25 = 0 due to the azimuthal symmetry of cross section .",
    "feature ( d ) has not too much experimental conformation yet , but below it is assumed to be valid .",
    "the features ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are well explained if we assume that at high enough energy and @xmath26 the analyzing power is described by a function of @xmath1 and a new scaling variable ( @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 the scaling variable @xmath27 is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are energies of the detected particle ( @xmath21 ) and the beam particle ( proton ) , respectively , in the laboratory frame , and a polarized beam particle collides with a target at rest .",
    "this occurs because in the fragmentation region @xmath2 is close to @xmath23 and its maximum is equal to 1.0 , whereas in the central region @xmath2 is close to @xmath32 and its maximum is equal to 0.5 , when beam energy is divided between two high @xmath24 jets ( particles ) . in case of experiments with a polarized target @xcite , @xmath2 is calculated in anti - laboratory frame , where a beam particle is again a transversely polarized proton .",
    "( [ eq : xa ] ) takes the form @xmath33 when it is expressed in the lorentz  invariant way .    the eq .",
    "( [ eq : fg ] ) means not only a scaling law for @xmath6 , but in addition a factorization of @xmath26 and @xmath27 dependences .",
    "this factorization simplifies the analysis and is in agreement with the existing data , as will be shown below .",
    "we expect that most ( but not all ) of the specified above analyzing power features ( a  e ) are valid not only for @xmath34 production , but also for other pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , as well as for some baryons ( protons , antiproton , hyperons ) , though the experimental information for some of them is very limited . in particular , feature ( e ) is valid for any considered reaction , since the normal vector to the scattering plane is undefined when @xmath40 , and no left - right asymmetry exists .",
    "of course , at @xmath41 analyzing power is also zero , but this is not an independent feature , since in this case @xmath40 .",
    "feature ( e ) means that @xmath42 , but it does not meant that @xmath43 . in particular",
    ", @xmath6 as a function of @xmath27 at fixed value of @xmath44 will not tends to zero when @xmath27 approaches zero . on the other hand",
    "if we consider @xmath6 measurements at fixed laboratory angle , as often happens , @xmath45 and @xmath6 tends to zero when @xmath27 approaches zero .",
    "there are several alternative variables which are numerically close to the @xmath2 variable , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : xa ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are momenta of the detected particle and beam particle , respectively , in the laboratory frame .",
    "all of them are very close to each other at high energies and the choice of the best scaling variable requires additional and very accurate measurements of the analyzing power and kinematic variables .",
    "( [ eq : xfr ] ) gives a very transparent explanation of the @xmath23-scaling in the fragmentation region and the @xmath24-scaling in the central region .",
    "the proposed scaling may be applied to the inclusive production of hadrons in the collisions of polarized protons with light nuclei . analyzing powers measured in reactions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a charged hadron ( @xmath54 , or @xmath55 ) agree within the errors @xcite .",
    "reactions with pion beam and polarized proton or deuteron targets also give analyzing power for @xmath56 production independent of the target within the errors @xcite .",
    "similar methods of different empirical scalings were used for the description of features of other reactions or observables .",
    "an example may be a description of the analyzing power in @xmath57 collisions with one outgoing charged particle .",
    "this reaction was often used for the polarimetry purposes ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in this and other similar cases an empirical description of one of observables",
    "seem to be a correct way to show common characteristics as well as possible hidden features of strong interaction .",
    "a thorough study of the available experimental data on the analyzing powers is presented in the subsequent sections .",
    "for the study of scaling features of the analyzing power all the available experimental data are presented in the frame in which a polarized proton is a projectile with spin directed upward and the target is at rest .",
    "the analyzing power is considered positive when more hadrons are produced to the left in the horizontal plane looking in the direction of the incident beam .",
    "thus , the original sign of the analyzing power for experiments @xcite has been changed to the opposite one , in agreement with the definition given above .",
    "kinematic variables for the experiments which used polarized target have been transformed into the anti - laboratory frame .",
    "unfortunately , not all authors in their publications presented a complete set of variables ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath23 ) for each point .",
    "for some experiments only limits on these variables are given that makes transformation to other variables biased and limits accuracy of the @xmath2-scaling check .",
    "additional error ( @xmath59 ) is added in quadrature to all errors of @xmath60-values to take into account possible variable bias and systematic errors during the fitting procedure below for @xmath21-meson production and other reactions if not stated otherwise .",

    "the analyzing power dependence on @xmath2 is close to a linear one in the consent with the feature ( a ) above . a simple expression , which takes into account all the features ( a  e ) and low energy corrections can be used to fit the data shown in fig .  [ pi1pp_3xa ] : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant .",
    "the perturbative qcd predicts the vanishing of the analyzing power at high @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the same asymptotic has function @xmath67 , which takes into account the above mentioned features ( d ) and ( e ) @xmath68 where @xmath1 is measured in gev / c and @xmath69 are free fit parameters .",
    "the exact shape of @xmath67 should be measured in future experiments .",

    "so , for @xmath21 at high enough energy we have @xmath73 .",
    "the point @xmath74 may be interpreted as a point where the relative phase of two helicity amplitudes ( spin - flip and spin - nonflip ) passes through zero and , perhaps , changes its sign , as was suggested in @xcite .",
    "this problem will be discussed in section 9 . from experimental point of view",
    "the zero - crossing point of the analyzing power was observed not only in the reaction of @xmath56 production by @xmath75 beam  @xcite , but similar indications were observed in some reactions of meson and baryon production by polarized proton beam  @xcite .",
    "experimental study of zero - crossing point is difficult because of small value of @xmath6 and low setup efficiency near that point .",
    "the existence of zero - crossing point ( with possible change of @xmath6 sign near it ) may be critical for many theoretical models .",

    "( [ eq : an1 ] ) , where the analyzing power changes its sign , can be explained by the same arguments which are used to explain the @xmath23-dependence of @xmath101-hyperon polarization in the su(6 ) based parton recombination model @xcite .",

    "the acceleration is replaced by the deceleration , which reverses the sea and valence quark spin directions and the analyzing power sign .    a dynamical reason for the above mentioned spin - momentum correlation is explained in @xcite by the effect of thomas precession @xcite .",

    "the analyzing power of @xmath21 production by polarized protons is determined by a product of the elementary subprocess analyzing power ( @xmath115 for polarized quark production ) , the polarization of this quark ( @xmath116 ) , and a `` dilution '' factor due to the presence of other contributions , not related with the valence quark fragmentation @xcite @xmath117 the @xmath113-quark polarization according to slac  @xcite , cern  @xcite and desy  @xcite measurements is positive and grows with a fraction of momentum carried by quark and in the first approximation can be taken as @xmath118 , which is a generalization of @xmath119 , assumed in @xcite .",

    "the reason is that the probability of quark spin - flip in an external field is proportional to a quark mean range before its hadronization .",

    "the higher constituent quark mass leads to a smaller chromomagnetic momentum ( @xmath153 ) and a smaller asymmetry @xcite .    a high value of @xmath76 is expected for the @xmath154 reaction at large @xmath2 ( see table  [ ktab1 ] ) which contradicts some models that predict zero asymmetry @xcite .",
    "we can make predictions for other reactions , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : an1])([eq : f1p ] ) and the parameters , presented in tables  [ tab1pi+ ]  [ pi_ap ] .",
    "it is shown that the existing analyzing power data in inclusive reactions for meson ( @xmath155 , @xmath37 , @xmath156 , @xmath39 ) and baryon ( @xmath55 , @xmath157 , @xmath101 ) productions in @xmath158- and @xmath159-collisions can be described by a simple function of three variables ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , where @xmath2 = @xmath3 is a new scaling variable . in the limit of high enough energy ( @xmath149 40 gev ) and high @xmath1 ( @xmath160 1.0 gev / c ) , @xmath76 is a function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 only with a precision of about 0.020.06 , depending on the reaction type .",
    "a simple expression @xmath161 can be used to approximate the experimental analyzing powers in the above range of high energies and @xmath1 .",
    "this scaling behaviour is better fulfilled for the @xmath21 , @xmath56 , @xmath108 , @xmath39 , and @xmath101-production in @xmath22-collisions , which takes place probably at the quark level .",
    "the most solid experimental conformation of the @xmath2-scaling exists now for @xmath21 production in @xmath162-collisions , where 6 independent measurements have been performed in a wide range of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 .",
    "significant non - asymptotic ( energy dependent ) contributions are observed for the @xmath75 and proton production .",
    "the former has a noticeable gluon contribution , and the latter can be produced mainly from protons , existing in the initial state .",
    "the analyzing power for some reactions has not yet been explored thoroughly enough to make a conclusion about the @xmath2-scaling features .",
    "the additional @xmath76-measurements are necessary at several c.m .",
    "angles in the central and fragmentation regions and at different energies .",
    "the bin size in @xmath2 and @xmath1 should be small enough to get one unbiased averaging over it , and to estimate mean values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 for each data point . in an ideal case , new experiments should measure @xmath2-dependence at fixed @xmath1 and @xmath1-dependence at fixed @xmath2",
    ". of interest is also a high @xmath1-region ( @xmath163 gev / c ) , where the decrease of the analyzing power is expected with a @xmath1 rise according to some models @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath2 for most of the hadrons has a characteristic point @xmath66 , where it intersects zero and probably changes its sign .",
    "such behaviour is in a qualitative agreement with the predictions from the models which take into account the thomas precession and chromomagnetic forces between an outgoing quark and the rest of hadronic system .",
    "the linear dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath2 for most of the reactions may indicate that the polarization of a valence quark , which is kicked out from a proton and fragments into a hadron @xmath53 , containing this quark , is proportional to @xmath2 or to the secondary hadron energy .    the use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : an1 ] )  ( [ eq : f1p ] ) with the known parameters allows one to predict @xmath76 in a wide range of kinematic variables and to use these predictions for the comparison with the models , to optimize future experiments and to use some reactions as polarimeters .",
