    "it is widely recognized that an accurate description of the dynamics of holes in antiferromagnetically ( af ) ordered materials is an important first step towards an understanding of the essential physics of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "consequently , numerous investigations have dealt with the problem of a single hole in a square - lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "most of these studies are based on an effective hamiltonian @xmath0 @xcite which describes the hole as a spinless fermion which is coupled to bosons representing the collective excitations ( magnons ) of the antiferromagnetic background .",
    "the structure of this effective hamiltonian reflects the two - sublattice structure of the square lattice af .",
    "when the hole hops between nearest neighbour lattice sites , it necessarily disturbs the magnetic order .",
    "thus , any move of the hole requires absorption or emission of a magnon .",
    "derivations of @xmath0 from the t - j hamiltonian have revealed the approximate nature of this effective hamiltonian @xcite , and to obtain the spectrum of a hole from @xmath0 further approximations are necessary .",
    "most often , the fermion - magnon coupling is treated in the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) which was already used in the original studies by kane et al .",
    "@xcite and marsiglio et al",
    ". @xcite . surprisingly , the approximate spectra obtained in this manner agree excellently with the spectra of small clusters obtained by numerically exact diagonalization of the @xmath1 hamiltonian for these clusters .",
    "apart from its relevance to the physics of cuprate superconductors , the dynamics of holes in ordered antiferromagnets is a highly nontrivial problem of the physics of strongly correlated electron systems , and it is therefore of fundamental theoretical interest . here , we shall present a derivation of effective hamiltonians for holes in afs which is not restricted to any particular type of magnetic order .",
    "our method does not provide us with a unique effective hamiltonian for an arbitrary number of holes .",
    "rather the cases of a single hole , two holes and in general an arbitrary but fixed number of holes have to be treated separately .",
    "while our presentation remains general , we shall confine ourselves to the single - hole problem in order to demonstrate our method s practical applicability .",
    "in particular , we shall derive and evaluate the effective hamiltonian @xmath2 for a single hole in the triangular af .",
    "for definiteness , we consider the @xmath1 hamiltonian , @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the single particle hopping matrix element and the exchange constant , respectively , the operator @xmath6 projects onto states in which each of the @xmath7 lattice sites is either empty or singly occupied , and @xmath8 is the electron spin expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for fermion states at site @xmath11 with spin projection @xmath12 .",
    "the sums in ( [ t - j ] ) run over pairs @xmath13 of nearest neighbour sites of the lattice .    in order to cast the partition function @xmath14 into the form of a path integral , we introduce the following coherent states @xcite for each lattice site @xmath11 ( we omit the site index wherever this does not lead to ambiguities ) : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are grassmann variables , and @xmath18 is the vacuum with no spins present . obviously , @xmath19 is a one - fermion state with spin in the direction @xmath20 on the sphere .",
    "the inclusion of a phase factor which depends on the third euler angle @xmath21 is necessary , if @xmath19 and @xmath16 are to satisfy the following requirements : ( _ i _ ) @xmath19 is to transform covariantly under _ all _ @xmath22 operations , while ( _ ii _ ) @xmath16 remains invariant under these operations .",
    "as will be seen shortly , both requirements appear natural in view of the physical interpretation of the variables @xmath23 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is easily checked that the states @xmath24 _ include _ the empty and the spin - up and spin - down states of the fermion , but _",
    "exclude _ the doubly occupied state .",
    "in fact , the states @xmath24 are complete in this three - dimensional space , @xmath25 where @xmath26 . the euler angles @xmath27 describe the spin degrees of freedom and the grassmann variables @xmath16 and @xmath28 a spinless fermionic hole .",

    "the corresponding transformation of the fields can be read off from ( [ coh ] ) .",
    "the field @xmath16 is unchanged and the linear changes in @xmath21 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 are ( we express the last two fields by x and p ) @xmath166\\nonumber\\\\ x_{\\bf r } ' & = & x_{\\bf r } + \\sqrt{2}\\epsilon^{z}\\nonumber\\\\ p_{\\bf r } ' & = & p_{\\bf r } + \\sqrt{2}\\left[-\\epsilon^{x } \\sin\\phi^{(0)}_{\\bf r}+ \\epsilon^{y } \\cos\\phi^{(0)}_{\\bf r}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{inftf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting these rotated fields for the original ones in ( [ lt1st ] ) , one sees that @xmath167 drops out and the change in the field @xmath83 induced by the other two rotations @xmath168 and @xmath169 is compensated by the corresponding change in the field @xmath170 .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath72 , and hence the whole lagrangian , is invariant under an infinitesimal rotation in spin space as it should be .",
    "it is only after the integration over the field @xmath21 that the invariance appears to be lost .",
    "turning to the case of the square lattice , where @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) , the zero modes are seen to decouple in @xmath170 and @xmath83 ( cf .",

    "it is easily verified from the spin wave expansion of @xmath70 that the zero modes are given by @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 , @xmath176 which both cancel in @xmath72 .",
    "after substituting @xmath177 by @xmath178 , we can integrate over @xmath21 , and return to the operator form .",
    "thus , the spin wave expansion as sketched in the main text leads to the correct result @xcite .    in the case of the triangular lattice , where @xmath92 for the three sublattices respectively , the zero modes in @xmath170 and @xmath83 mix .",
    "again , it is easily verified from the spin wave expansion of @xmath70 that they are given by @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath175 , @xmath179 .",
    "the first mode cancels in @xmath72 , but the last two remain , if one disregards @xmath21 .",
    "however , we are free to apply a canonical transformation to the fields @xmath21 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 in the path integral .",
    "we choose @xmath182 ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 are the three nearest neighbour vectors . ) with this choice ( _ i _ ) the new field @xmath21 remains invariant under homogeneous rotations in spin space , i.e. it does not contain a zero mode , and ( _ ii _ ) @xmath73 is changed only by a total time derivative which yields no change in the action ( the latter condition is equivalent to the transformation being canonical ) . after applying ( [ a3 ] ) to @xmath77 ,",
    "all zero modes cancel in @xmath72 .",
    "we substitute @xmath177 by @xmath178 , integrate over @xmath21 , and return to the operator representation . the result for @xmath2",
