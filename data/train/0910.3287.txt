    "uv divergences in quantum field theories can be regularized by introducing higher derivatives in the kinetic term so that the propagator approaches faster to @xmath3 than @xmath4 at large momenta @xmath5 . but",
    "this is usually done at the cost of unitarity .",
    "for example , by the pauli - villars regularization @xcite the propagator is modified as @xmath6 this propagator @xmath7 at large @xmath5 , hence alleviates the uv divergence of a feynman diagram . however , the norm of the propagating mode at @xmath8 is negative due to the minus sign of the pole at @xmath9 .",
    "unitarity is violated for energies beyond the ghost mass @xmath10 .    in @xcite , a higher derivative correction to the propagator of the form",
    "@xmath11 is considered . due to the condition @xmath12",
    ", cutkosky s rules @xcite ensure purturbative unitarity for generic feynman diagrams .",
    "need to be considered , and thus the fact that there are infinitely many poles in the propagator is irrelevant . ] in this paper we adopt the same type of propagators , thus our theories are automatically unitary .",
    "the models we consider are also manifestly lorentz invariant .",
    "hence , in the following we will focus our attention on the removal of uv divergence .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that to avoid uv divergence in the four dimensional @xmath0 theory , the following conditions are sufficient :    [ condition ] @xmath13    since all the parameters @xmath14must be greater than zero to ensure unitarity , thes conditions look impossible .",
    "the trick is that , since there is an infinite number of @xmath14 s , analytic continuation can be used @xcite to satisfy both conditions in eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) .",
    "for example , with two constant parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 , let    @xmath17    then one can analytically continue the infinite sum to a simple form    [ zeta ] @xmath18 [ examplealc ]    note that the two infinite series above diverge if @xmath15 or @xmath19 , respectively , but we define them by analytic continuation .    three important issues must be addressed immediately .",
    "first , it is important that the analytic continuation can be carried out consistently throughout all calculations",
    ". this will be the main concern when we give a prescription for the computation of feynman diagrams .",
    "secondly , some of the readers may be uncomfortable with this analytic continuation , in the absence of an intuitive physical interpretation .",
    "however , we will point out that a similar analytic continuation is naturally incorporated in string theory from the viewpoint of the worldsheet theory",
    ". it will be very interesting to construct an analogous worldsheet theory that will directly justify the analytic continuation used in our models .",
    "but we shall leave this problem for the future .    finally , while there is an infinite number of poles in the propagator , this theory is also equivalent to a theory with an infinite number of scalar fields with masses @xmath20 . if @xmath21 for all @xmath22 , the low energy behavior of this theory is approximated by an ordinary scalar field theory with a single scalar field with mass @xmath23 .",
    "in this paper we will discuss a generic scalar field theory in general even dimensions .",
    "after studying the relations among interaction vertices , internal lines , external lines and loops in feynman diagrams , we enumerate the conditions sufficient to eliminate all superficial divergences to ensure uv - finiteness . in the last section , we will discuss the physical meaning of analytic continuation , making an analogy with string theory .",
    "in this section we study the patterns of uv - divergence in a @xmath1 theory in 4 dimensional space - time , and list all the conditions needed to eliminate all the uv - divergences . roughly speaking , the more divergent",
    "a feynman diagram is , the more conditions we need to make it finite .",
    "thus we are particularly interested in the most divergent diagrams in order to find all the conditions needed to guarantee uv finiteness . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that there is a unique @xmath1 interaction in the theory",
    ". nevertheless , our conclusion will also apply to more general theories including @xmath24 interactions , since one can always construct the most divergent diagrams with @xmath1 interactions alone .    in a diagram with superficial divergence of dimension @xmath25 ,",
    "in general there are divergent terms proportional to @xcite @xmath26 in 4 dimensions , the superficial divergence @xmath25 is determined by the number of loops @xmath27 and the number of internal lines ( propagators ) @xmath28 as @xmath29 on the other hand , the number of loops @xmath27 is related to the number of vertices @xmath30 and internal lines @xmath28 via , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is because the propagator in the loop does not have its endpoints ending on vertices . ]",
    "@xmath33 this equation can be understood as follows .",
    "the calculation of a feynman diagram with @xmath27 loops always turns out to be an integration over @xmath27 free momentum parameters ( @xmath34 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of free momentum parameters should also equal the total number of momenta @xmath28 assigned to each propagator ( @xmath35 ) minus the number of constraints @xmath30 for the momentum conservation at each vertex .",
    "however , the constraints of momentum conservation at all vertices are not linearly independent .",
    "the number @xmath36 on the right hand side of ( [ loopandvertex ] ) corresponds to the momentum conservation of the whole diagram , which is automatically satisfied by the assignment of external momenta .",
    "another equality that will be used later is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of external lines and @xmath2 the number of legs of each interaction vertex . using the relations above , we can express @xmath25 as @xmath39    in the 4 dimensional @xmath0 theory , @xmath25 only depends on the number of external lines @xmath38 as @xmath40 , and is thus bounded from above by @xmath41 .",
    "this is why we only need two conditions ( [ condition ] ) to eliminate the divergences of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    for @xmath1 theories with @xmath44 ,",
    "the large @xmath30 is , the higher superficial divergence @xmath25 can be . _",
    "a priori _ this may enforce us to impose infinitely many conditions of the form _",
    "n c_n m_n^2r=0 [ typicalcond ] with @xmath45 .",
    "however the divergence of a diagram can sometimes be decomposed into lower dimensional divergences .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0 theory , there is a diagram with superficial divergence @xmath46 ( see fig.[scalartwoloops ] ) ,        but since the two loops are separable , this diagram only needs a single condition of dimension @xmath47 ( [ condition]a ) to avoid the divergence",
    ".    from section 3.4 of @xcite , a generic feynman diagram with @xmath27 loops is of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the momentum of the @xmath50-th internal line , which is a linear combination of the loop mementa @xmath51 and the momenta of external lines @xmath52 . using feynman s parameters ,",
    "this quantity can be rewritten as @xmath53 by shifting the loop momenta @xmath54 , the integrand can be simplified as @xmath55 where @xmath56 s are functions of the parameters @xmath57 , and @xmath58 where @xmath59 s are function of the feynman parameters @xmath57 .    before summing over @xmath60 , each integral in ( [ mgeneral ] ) is potentially divergent .",
    "our prescription of calculation is to first regularize all divergent integrals by dimensional regularization @xmath61 , and after imposing the conditions ( [ condition ] ) , we take the limit @xmath62 to obtain the final result .",
    "one could also apply other regularization schemes instead of dimensional regularization .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , for the diagrams we computed explicitly , various different regularization methods give exactly the same result .",
    "this may be a general feature of our models , although a rigorous proof is yet to be given .    by the general formula of dimensional regularization@xcite @xmath63 apart from the integration over @xmath64 s , equation([mgeneral ] ) can be integrated over loop momenta @xmath65 s one by one as @xmath66 it is easy to see that the gamma function appearing in the denominator after integrating over a loop momentum always cancels the numerator due to the previous integral .",
    "after we integrate over all loop momenta , the final result of ( [ mgeneral2 ] ) is proportional to @xmath67 \\frac{(-1)^{d/2}}{\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right ) ! }",

    "the uv divergence of the diagram is summarized in the first term in ( [ mgeneral3 ] ) , which diverges in the limit @xmath62 . to eliminate this uv divergence",
    ", we need @xmath69 if this condition is satisfied , the third term also vanishes and the second term in ( [ mgeneral3 ] ) contributes to the finite part of the amplitude @xmath70    as we look at diagrams with higher and higher superficial divergence @xmath25 , there is a chance of finding new conditions of the form ( [ typicalcond ] ) with larger and larger values of @xmath71 in order for ( [ 20 ] ) to remain valid . to understand the precise connection between @xmath25 and the values of @xmath71",
    ", we decompose ( [ 20 ] ) intro equations of the form ( [ typicalcond ] ) with different values of @xmath71 .",

    "thus we can first remove all the terms in ( [ n1n2n3am ] ) that already vanish due to these conditions .",
    "this means that in the expansion of @xmath80 , we must be able to associate at least two factors of @xmath81 to each @xmath82 in order for a particular term to survive .",
    "however , since each term in the expansion of @xmath80 is a product of @xmath83 powers of @xmath84 , and there are @xmath28 possible values of the index @xmath50 on @xmath82 to check , it will not be possible to associate two or more factors of @xmath81 for all values of @xmath50 if @xmath85 as a result there will be no condition other than @xmath77 and @xmath86=0 if @xmath87 combining this with eq .",

    "thus we have proven that in 4 dimensions all @xmath1 theories are uv finite if the propagator ( [ propagator ] ) satisfies the conditions ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "in general , the relation between the superficial divergence @xmath25 and space - time dimension @xmath90 is @xmath91 in this paper we restrict our disscussion to the cases of even dimensional space - time .",
    "the reason is that odd dimensions may lead to odd values of superficial divergence @xmath25 , and @xmath92 is no longer a polynomial of @xmath93 .    repeating the arguments in the previous section for a generic even dimension @xmath90 , we find",
    "( [ vge1 ] ) replaced by @xmath94 this condition can be easily violated when @xmath95 .",
    "for example , the simple @xmath0 one - loop diagram in fig.[oneloop5d ] for 6 dimensional spacetime has a superficial divergence of @xmath96 .",
    "clearly we need one more condition @xmath97 in addition to ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "the next question is : for given @xmath2 and @xmath98 , do we need infinitely many conditions to ensure all diagrams to be finite , or only a finite number of conditions suffice to avoid all uv divergences ?    to answer this question , we revisit eq .",

    "if we impose sufficiently many conditions of the form ( [ typicalcond ] ) to ensure that ( [ n1n2n3am ] ) vanishes , there would be no uv divergences . if @xmath99 , there are terms in ( [ n1n2n3am ] ) with a factor of @xmath100 to the 4th or higher powers associated with each factor of @xmath82 s , and thus we need the condition @xmath97 in order to remove such terms .",
    "similarly , if @xmath101 , we also need @xmath102 , and so on . in general , for a feynman diagram with superficial divergence @xmath25 and @xmath28 internal lines , we need conditions ( [ typicalcond ] ) with @xmath103 $ ] , where @xmath104 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath105 .",

    "if the set of @xmath104 $ ] for all feynman diagrams is unbounded from above , we need an infinite number of conditions .    using ( [ ddli ] ) , and then ( [ loopandvertex ] ) , one can express @xmath25 in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath28 as d = dl - 2i = d(i - v+1 ) - 2i = ( d-2)i - d(v-1 ) ( d-2)i .",

    "it might appear strange to some readers that the analytic continuation of a parameter in the propagator is used to eliminate uv divergences .",
    "what is the physical meaning of this analytic continuation ? we will try to give some hint to answering this question .",
    "first , analytic continuation means the extension of the domain of a function @xmath123 under the requirement of analyticity .",
    "for example , if we define @xmath123 by the series @xmath124 the domain of @xmath123 should be restricted to @xmath125 because the radius of convergence is @xmath36 .",
    "however , we can extend the definition of @xmath123 by analytic continuation to the whole complex plane except the point at @xmath126 , so that @xmath127    in mathematical manipulations of physical equations , there is a physical reason for analytic continuation . due to the use of certain computational techniques or one s choice of formulation , the validity of some mathematical expressions may be restricted , but often the physical quantities we are computing could be well - defined with a larger range of validity .",
    "relying on the analyticity of the physical problem , analytic continuation allows us to retrieve the full range of validity of our results , even though the validity of derivation is more restricted .    as an example , imagine that in a physical problem , we need to solve the following differential equation @xmath128 one might try to solve this differential equation as an expansion @xmath129 and obtain some recursion relations which results in the solution ( [ seriessol ] ) , up to an overall constant .",
    "if one analytically continues this result to ( [ exact ] ) , one can directly check that it is the correct solution of the differential equation even for @xmath130 outside the range @xmath125 .",
    "the appearance of the series ( [ seriessol ] ) and the convergence condition @xmath131 is merely an artifact of the technique used in derivation .      in this subsection",
    ", we shall review how uv divergence is avoided in string theory via analytic continuation .",
    "apart from factors involving vertex operators , the formula for the amplitudes of one - loop diagrams contain a common factor @xcite @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "this factor comes from the self energy diagram of an open string .",
    "the trace of eq . ( [ openstring1 ] ) includes summation over each state in the spectrum and integration of energy - momentum .",
    "the factor @xmath134 is an operator that propagates a string through a proper time of length @xmath135 ( which is positive , since @xmath136 ) .",
    "the regime @xmath137 corresponds to a very short proper time , and thus a very narrow cylinder ( see fig.[worldsheet1 ] ) ; this is thus the ultraviolet regime .    to take a closer look at the uv behavior of @xmath138 ( [ openstring1 ] ) ,",
    "one can formally compute @xmath138 as also diverges .",
    "but our attention is on the uv divergent terms due to integration over the regime @xmath139 . ]",
    "a_0&=&^l_0 - 1|_0 ^ 1 + & = & d^d p_n ( 1^l_0 - 1 - 0^l_0 - 1 ) + & = & d^d p_n .",
    "[ stringdivergence ] the factor @xmath140 comes from the symmetry factor of particles depending on their spin . here",
    "we notice that the momentum integration leads to a uv divergence for each particle propagator .",
    "naively , the sum over the contributions from infinitely many particles can only make the uv divergence infinitely worse .",
    "but it is well known that string theory is free from uv divergence .",
    "we will see below that the trick is analogous to the analytic continuation we used to regularize the scalar field theories .",
    "let us recall that string theory solves this uv problem by conformal symmetry and open - closed string duality . by scaling symmetry , a cylinder with length @xmath141 ( see fig . [ worldsheet2 ] ) and",
    "circumference @xmath142 is equivalent to fig .",
    "[ worldsheet1 ] .",
    "we can look at this diagram with a different perspective , interpreting it as a propagating closed string over a proper time @xmath141 .",
    "when @xmath143 is close to 1 , the cylinder is very long .",
    "the @xmath137 regime is no longer the ultraviolet regime , but the infrared regime .",
    "defining @xmath144 , let us consider a closed string propagating for the proper time @xmath145 .",
    "the amplitude for this process is of the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the evolution operator that carries the initial state to the final state @xmath148 in the infrared regime @xmath137 , a closed string with zero momentum propagates for a very long proper time .",
    "it follows that the states @xmath149 and @xmath150 are of nearly zero momentum , and classical trajectories dominate the path integral . since the equation of motion and level matching condition @xmath151 are satisfied for the classical trajectories",
    ", we expect that @xmath152 as there is a @xmath153 factor in the denominator in ( [ closedoneloop ] ) , the only divergence in @xmath138 comes from the tachyon ( @xmath154 ) , which can be removed in superstring theories , and the infrared divergence of the dilaton ( @xmath155 ) , which is analogous to the ir divergence typical in massless field theories .",
    "therefore , one concludes that the uv divergence in an open superstring one - loop diagram disappears if we compute it in the closed string picture .",
    "since it is the string worldsheet duality that allows us to identify the ill - defined expansion of @xmath138 in ( [ stringdivergence ] ) with the uv - finite closed string tree level diagram , we want to take a closer look at the string worldsheet duality and compare it with our trick of analytic continuation .",
    "the simplest example of string worldsheet duality is the @xmath156 duality of open - string 4-point amplitudes .",
    "consider the 4-point tree - level scattering amplitudes in @xmath157channel @xmath158 and @xmath159channel @xmath160 note that in order for the two quantities to be identical @xmath161 , the sum @xmath162 must be an infinite series and the masses @xmath163 and couplings @xmath164 must be fine - tuned .",
    "the parameters are chosen such that    @xmath165    where @xmath166 . since @xmath167 ,",

    "the duality that interchanges a one - loop open string diagram with a tree - level closed string diagram is a result of the wick rotation on the worldsheet .",
    "the wick rotation is an analytic continuation .",
    "the infinite number of poles , fine - tuned masses and couplings in string theory are all reminiscent to our choice of the propagator ( [ propagator ] ) .",
    "the key ingredients that allow us to remove uv divergences are exactly the same in our model and in string theory .",
    "the only difference is that in string theory the ( much finer ) fine - tuning leads to a large symmetry ( conformal symmetry ) , and is capable of removing uv divergences even in the presence of vector and tensor fields .",
    "it is tempting to make the conjecture that the fine - tuning conditions ( [ generalcond ] ) also correspond to some symmetries .",

    ". it should be straightforward to generalize our discussion above to scalar field theories ( [ s1 ] ) with more than one scalar fields @xmath182 with polynomial type interactions .",
    "the prescription for calculating feynman diagrams is to first use dimensional regularization to regularize integrals over internal momenta , and then impose the conditions ( [ generalcond ] ) to remove all uv divergences in the limit @xmath183 .",

    "roughly speaking , the conditions ( [ generalcond ] ) remove the first @xmath107 terms in the large @xmath5 expansion of the propagator f(k^2 ) = _ n = - + - .",
    "hence the propagator goes to zero as fast as @xmath184 as @xmath185 , removing uv divergences for all diagrams .",
    "since the propagator @xmath186 is the same as the sum over ordinary propagators of particles of mass @xmath20 with a normalization constat @xmath14 , the perturbation theory of ( [ s1 ] ) is the same as that of the action [ s2 ] s = d^d x ( _ n _ n ( -^2 + m_n^2 ) _ n - v(_n _ n ) ) . the same action can also be written as [ s3 ] s ",

    "the analogy between string theory and the higher derivative theory defined by the propagator ( [ propagator ] ) was made in sec .",
    "while the worldsheet conformal symmetry justifies the analytic continuation and fine tuning of the mass spectrum in string theory , it would be of crucial importance to search for a symmetry principle underlying the fine - tuning conditions ( [ generalcond ] ) .",

    "<S> following a previous work ( hep - th/0410248 ) , where a scalar field theory with a modified propagator and @xmath0 interaction in 4 dimensions is constructed to be uv - finite , unitary and lorentz invariant , we discuss in this paper general @xmath1 theory in arbitrary even space - time dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the theory is still uv - finite , unitary and lorentz invariant if the propagators are chosen to meet certain simple conditions depending on the space - time dimension but independent of @xmath2 . </S>",
