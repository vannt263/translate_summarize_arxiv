    "the model for a hydrogen atom , ha , confined in an impenetrable sphere of finite radius @xmath3 was originally introduced @xcite to simulate the effect of high pressure on atomic static dipole polarizability .",
    "sommerfeld and welker @xcite formulated the wave function solutions for this potential in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions , and underlined the application of this model for the prediction of the line spectrum originating from atomic hydrogen in the outer atmosphere .",
    "an algorithm for obtaining nearly exact energy calculations for a spherically confined hydrogen atom has been published @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "regular  soft confinement of the coulombic systems has been developed by superimposing debye screening @xcite . such a confining potential has been successful in explaining @xcite the shift in frequency of the x - ray spectral lines emitted by laser - imploded plasmas in the limit of high plasma density , whereby the effective potential assumes the form given by the coulomb plus oscillator potential .",
    "the harmonic potential can be considered here as giving rise to the confinement of the coulomb system with soft boundary walls .",
    "a variety of other model potentials leading to the confinement of electrons in atoms and molecules have been proposed , in order to explain the behavior of the novel artificial nanostructures , such as quantum wires and quantum dots , atoms and molecules embedded inside fullerenes , zeolites and liquid helium droplets , and , in addition , to simulate the interior of a giant planet .",
    "a comprehensive review covering of the development and applications of confining model potentials has been recently published @xcite . under the confinement effect of an impenetrable spherical cavity of radius @xmath3 , the hydrogen atom and the isotropic harmonic oscillator , iho , potentials have been studied , independently , and their spectral characteristics have been analyzed @xcite in terms of useful quasi exact results . in the following text",
    ", we shall denote the spherically confined hydrogen atom as scha and the spherically confined isotropic harmonic oscillator as sciho : in both cases , the eigenstates are labelled as @xmath5 , in terms of which the number of radial nodes for a given @xmath6 becomes @xmath7    0.1true in for the _ free _ coulomb plus oscillator potential , a few exploratory calculations have been reported earlier @xcite . in view of the importance of the conjoined coulomb and harmonic oscillator potential",
    ", it useful to study the general behavior of this potential under the confinement due to an impenetrable spherical cavity , as a function of the radius @xmath3 , where the free state is represented by @xmath8 . in this paper we consider a general spherically symmetric model of atomic system confined by ( i ) the presence of a harmonic - oscillator potential term and in a representative set of cases also ( ii ) containment inside an impenetrable spherical box of radius @xmath3 . in atomic units @xmath9 the hamiltonian for the model system",
    "is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are coupling parameters .",
    "we shall always assume that @xmath13 and for the most part , we shall assume that the coulomb term is also attractive , @xmath14 we shall also consider the repulsive case @xmath15 , in which @xmath16 becomes a model , for example , for a system composed of a pair of confined electrons .",
    "0.1true in we shall now present a brief review of the known results defining the spectral characteristics of the two confined systems scha and sciho .",
    "it is well known that the so called _ accidental degeneracy _ of free ha is removed in the scha . as @xmath17 , the energy levels @xmath18 increase in magnitude such that the higher @xmath6 states get relatively less destabilized .",
    "there exists a critical value of @xmath3 above which @xmath19 .",
    "further , two additional kinds of degeneracies arise @xcite",
    ". they result from the specific choice of the radius of confinement @xmath3 , chosen exactly at the radial nodes corresponding to the free ha wave functions . in the _ incidental degeneracy _",
    "case , a given confined @xmath20 state becomes iso - energic with @xmath21 state of the _ free _ ha with energy @xmath22 a.u .",
    ", at the same @xmath3 .  in the _ simultaneous degeneracy _ case , on the other hand , a certain pair of confined states at the common radius of confinement @xmath3 that is prescribed in terms of the location of the radial node in a specific free state of ha , become iso - energic .",
    "for example , for all @xmath23 , each @xmath24 scha state is degenerate with @xmath25 state , when both of them are confined at @xmath26 , which defines the radial node in the free @xmath27 state .",
    "both these degeneracies have been shown @xcite to result from the gauss relationship applied at a unique @xmath3 by the confluent hypergeometric functions that describe the general solutions of the scha problem .",
    "0.1true in we note that free iho energy levels show the well - known `` @xmath28 '' degeneracy with the equidistant eigenvalues given by @xmath29  for a given @xmath6 .",
    "such a degeneracy is removed under the confined conditions .",
    "as @xmath19 at all @xmath3 , the critical radius is absent .",
    "the _ incidental degeneracy _ observed in the case of sciho is qualitatively similar to that of the scha .",
    "however , the behavior of the two confined states at a common radius of confinement is found to be different @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the sciho the pairs of the confined states defined by @xmath20 and @xmath30 at the common @xmath31 a.u .",
    ", display for all @xmath32 , a constant energy separation of _ exactly _ @xmath33 harmonic - oscillator units ,  @xmath34 , with the state of higher @xmath35 corresponding to lower energy .",
    "the choice of @xmath3 is qualitatively similar to that in the case of scha , namely , it is the location of the radial node in the @xmath20 state which is the first excited state corresponding to a given @xmath6 for the free iho .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two confined states at the common @xmath3 with @xmath36 , considered above , contain different numbers of radial nodes . 0.1true in    with this background , we shall now consider the spherically confined potential defined in eq.([hamitonian ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the scaling properties and monotonicity of the eigenspectrum generated by the potential @xmath2 , as a function of the parameters of the potential , are derived .",
    "analytic energy bounds , derived by the envelope method , are reported in section  3 : these are found to be useful in guiding the search for very accurate values by numerical methods . in sections  4 and 5 ,",
    "we use the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) to study how the eigenvalues depend on the potential parameters @xmath37 , repectively for the free system ( @xmath38 ) , and for finite @xmath3 . in each of these sections ,",
    "the results obtained are of two types : exact analytic results that are valid when certain parametric constraints are satisfied , and accurate numerical values for arbitrary sets of potential parameters . in section  6",
    "we adjoin some more numerical data , obtained by the generalized pseudo - spectral ( gps ) legendre method , and present a detailed analysis of the spectral characteristics of the system and their experimental significance .",
    "since the potential and the confining box are spherically symmetric , we may write the energy eigenfunctions in the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for finite box sizes",
    "@xmath3 we also require @xmath42 in terms of the atomic units used , each discrete eigenvalue depends on three parameters .",
    "we shall express this by writing @xmath43 . if we now introduce a scale factor ( dilation ) @xmath44 into the terms of the hamiltonian , so that @xmath45 , then , after multiplying the eigenequation @xmath46 through by @xmath47 we may derive the general scaling law @xmath48 for example , the particular choices @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 then yield , respectively , the special scaling laws @xmath52 thus it would be sufficient to consider just two spectral parameters .",
    "0.1true in the eigenvalues @xmath53 are monotonic in each parameter . for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "this is a direct consequence of the monotonicity of the potential @xmath54 in these parameters . indeed , since @xmath55 and @xmath56 , it follows that @xmath57 the monotonicity with respect to the box size @xmath3 may be proved by a variational argument .",
    "we shall show in section  ( [ bounds ] ) that the hamiltonian @xmath16 is bounded below .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath16 may therefore be characterized variationally .",
    "let us consider two box sizes , @xmath58 and an angular momentum subspace labelled by a fixed @xmath59 we extend the domains of the wave functions in the finite - dimensional subspace spanned by the first @xmath60 radial eigenfunctions for @xmath61 so that the new space @xmath62 may be used to study the case @xmath63 .",
    "we do this by defining the extended eigenfunctions so that @xmath64 for @xmath65 we now look at @xmath16 in @xmath62 with box size @xmath66 .",
    "the minima of the energy matrix @xmath67 $ ] are the exact eigenvalues for @xmath68 and , by the rayleigh - ritz principle , these values are one - by - one upper bounds to the eigenvalues for @xmath69 thus , by formal argument we deduce what is perhaps intuitively clear , that the eigenvalues increase as @xmath3 is decreased , that is to say @xmath70 from a classical point of view , this heisenberg - uncertainty effect is perhaps counter intuitive : if we try to squeeze the electron into the coulomb well by reducing @xmath3 , the reverse happens ; eventually , the eigenvalues become positive and arbitrarily large , and less and less affected by the presence of the coulomb singularity . 0.1true in for some of our results we shall consider the system unconstrained by a spherical box , that is to say @xmath71 for these cases , we shall write @xmath72 if a very special box is now considered , whose size @xmath3 coincides with any radial node of the @xmath73 problem , then the two problems share an eigenvalue exactly .",
    "this is an example of a very general relation which exists between constrained and unconstrained eigensystems , and , indeed , also between two constrained systems with different box sizes .",
    "the generalized heisenberg uncertainty relation may be expressed @xcite as the operator inequality @xmath74 this allows us to construct the following lower energy bound @xmath75.\\ ] ] provided @xmath76 this lower bound is finite for all @xmath11 .",
    "it also obeys the same scaling and monotonicity laws as @xmath77 itself .",
    "but the bound is weak . for potentials such as @xmath2 that satisfy @xmath78 common",
    "has shown @xcite for the ground state that @xmath79 but the resulting energy lower bound is still weak . 0.1true in for the unconstrained case @xmath38 , however , envelope methods @xcite allow one to construct analytical upper and lower energy bounds with general forms similar to ( [ lbound ] ) . in this case we shall write @xmath72 upper and lower bounds on the eigenvalues are based on the geometrical fact that @xmath2 is at once a concave function @xmath80 of @xmath81 and a convex function @xmath82 of @xmath83 .",
    "thus tangents to the @xmath84 functions are either shifted scaled oscillators above @xmath2 , or shifted scaled atoms below @xmath2 .",

    "it is clear that the lower energy bound has the coulombic degeneracies , and the upper bound those of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "these bounds are very helpful as a guide when we seek very accurate numerical estimates for these eigenvalues .",

    "we shall first consider the case defined by @xmath297 and variable @xmath12 , under which the potential given by eq.(1 ) can be regarded as representing the hydrogen atom confined by a soft harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "starting from the free ha @xmath298 , the effect of finite @xmath12 is to remove the accidental degeneracy and raise the energy levels such that @xmath299 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as the starting @xmath300 given by the ha spectrum",
    ", there exists a critical value of @xmath301 , corresponding to each level , defined by the condition @xmath302 .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath303 are found to be rather small , except for the ground state , indicating that a weak confinement due to the harmonic potential is sufficient to realize the condition that @xmath304 for all @xmath305 . in the usual spectroscopic notations",
    "the levels @xmath306 are defined by the @xmath303 values given respectively by @xmath307 in fig .  1 , we have displayed the passing of the energy levels corresponding to @xmath308 states through @xmath309 at @xmath303 .",
    "we know tht the eigenspectrum of free ha is indeed very sensitive to the harmonic confinement since it is found numerically that at @xmath310 , the eigenvalues are already positive , corresponding to the states given by @xmath311 .",
    "the crossings of energy levels can be gauged by the change of ordering from the hydrogen - like @xmath312 to @xmath313 as the parameters of the potential change along @xmath314 @xmath315 @xmath316 @xmath315 @xmath317 .",

    "it is evident that the imposition of a double confinement effect , mediated through the combination of @xmath119 and the boundary at @xmath3 leads to the crossings among a wider set of the states of the hydrogen - like atom , not observed in the separate singly confined situations .",

    "in this study we first consider a very elementary model for an atom , namely a single particle which moves in a central coulomb potential @xmath118 and obeys quantum mechanics . we then adjoin two confining features : soft confinement by means of an attractive oscillator term @xmath343 and hard confinement produced by containment inside an impenetrable spherical cavity of radius @xmath344 the paper reports on the effects of the confinement parameters @xmath345 on the original coulomb spectrum which , of course , is given in atomic units by @xmath346 by a combination of analytical and numerical techniques , we are able to make considerable progress in analyzing the spectral characteristics of this confined atomic model . in future work",
