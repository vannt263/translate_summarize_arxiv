    "most of the prompt emission spectra of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can be described by the well - known band function @xcite ; the photon number spectrum @xmath0 below @xmath1 , and @xmath2 above it .",
    "the spectral peak energy @xmath1 are usually seen in the mev range .",
    "one of main scientific targets for the _ fermi _ satellite was to investigate whether the spectral shape is consistent with the band function even in the gev band . the _ fermi _ detected gev photons from several very bright bursts ( @xmath3 erg ) such as grb 080916c @xcite , grb 090902b @xcite , and grb 090926a @xcite .",
    "in such bursts the onset of the gev emission is delayed with respect to the mev emission .",
    "some of them also have an extra spectral component above a few gev , distinct and additional to the usual band function .",
    "interestingly , grb 090902b and grb 090510 @xcite show a further , soft excess feature below @xmath4 kev , which is consistent with a continuation of the gev power - law component .",
    "while such spectra may be explained by the early onset of the afterglow @xcite , here we pursue possibility of internal - shock origins .",
    "if the spectral excesses in gev and kev bands have the same origin , such a wide photon - energy range may imply the cascade emission due to hadrons .",
    "if the grb accelerated ultra - high - energy protons , synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) emission from an electron - positron pair cascade triggered by photopion interactions of the protons with low - energy photons @xcite can reproduce power - law photon spectra as seen in _",
    "fermi_-lat grbs .",
    "through monte carlo simulations , asano et al . @xcite have shown that a proton luminosity much larger than gamma - ray luminosity is required to produce the extra spectral component in grb 090510 as @xmath5 erg @xmath6 ( see fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "namely , the efficiency of photopion production is very low . in this case",
    ", the spectrum of the gev component is very hard with photon index @xmath7 , which requires a inverse compton ( ic ) contribution from the secondary pairs .",
    "the prominent ic component leads to a weaker magnetic field .",
    "this entails a lower maximum energy of protons , and hence lower photopion production efficiency .",
    "therefore , the required proton luminosity is so large in grb 090510 .",
    "the assumed bulk lorentz factor in fig.[f1 ] is 1500 , and the emission radius is @xmath8 cm .",
    "if we adopt a smaller value of @xmath9 , the pion production efficiency would increases as @xmath10 .",
    "however , we should note that there is a lower limit to @xmath9 , which is required to make the source optically thin to gev photons .",
    "given the photon luminosity and spectral shape , this minimum lorentz factor can be estimated as shown in the online supporting materials in abdo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) @xcite . in order to lower @xmath9",
    ", we have to increase the emission radius @xmath11 . the lower limit of the lorentz factor @xmath12 does not decrease drastically ( since @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the required large luminosity is rather favorable for the grb - uhecr scenario , but it imposes stringent requirements on the energy budget of the central engine .    on the other hand , grb 090902b is encouraging for the hadronic model because of its flat spectrum ( photon index @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the band component in this burst is an atypically narrow energy distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , which may imply the photospheric emission @xcite .",
    "the hadronic cascade emission can well reproduce the observed flat spectra including the soft excess feature below 50 kev ( model parameters : @xmath8 cm , @xmath16 ) .",
    "owing to the flat spectral shape of the extra component , no ic component is required .",
    "we can adopt a strong magnetic field , which enhance the photomeson production efficiency . in this case",
    "the flux of the extra component is relatively low compared to the band component , which also decreases the required proton luminosity .",
    "therefore , the necessary nonthermal proton luminosity is then not excessive and only comparable to the band component luminosity .",
    "as corsi et al .",
    "@xcite discussed , the gev emission may be due to ic emission from internal dissipation regions .",
    "however , it seems difficult to explain spectral excesses in both kev and gev bands by ic emission .",
    "recently , we carry out time - dependent simulations of photon emissions with leptonic models @xcite . in our simulations , as the photon energy density increases with time because of synchrotron emission , the ssc component gradually grows and dominate the photon field later .",
    "this late growth of the ic component has been observed also in the simulations of bonjak et al .",
    "( 2009 ) @xcite .",
    "the resultant lightcurves show delayed onset of gev emission , but the delay timescale would be within the approximate timescale of the kev - mev pulse width . however ,",
    "the longer delay compared to the pulse timescale such as observed in grb 080916c is not explained by this effect only .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ( model parameters : @xmath17 cm , @xmath18 , @xmath19 g , @xmath20 erg , @xmath21 gev ) , the model spectrum obtained from our simulations reproduce both the low and high energy excesses . when the magnetic field is weak enough , even at the end of the electron injection",
    ", the cooled electrons can be still relativistic .",
    "such cooled electrons continue emitting synchrotron photons .",
    "the cooling due to ic gradually becomes inefficient as the seed photon density decreases .",
    "such late synchrotron emission can yield the low - energy excess , while ic emission makes a gev extra component .",
    "another possible model is the external ic emissions @xcite , which can explain the delayed onset of gev emission .",
    "the spatial separation between the source of the external photons and the site of the internal shock region corresponds to the delay timescale .",
    "we also carry out a simulation for this model assuming an external emission @xmath22 with the band function : @xmath23 mev in the observer frame , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the parameters for the internal shock are similar to those in fig.[f3 ] as @xmath17 cm , @xmath18 , @xmath19 g , @xmath26 erg , except for @xmath27 mev .",
    "our simulation reproduces the delayed onset of gev emission , gev extra component , and softening of the band component .",
    "since the external photon field in the rest frame of the emission region is highly anisotropic , the marginally high - latitude emission contributes the most to the flux .",
    "thus , the simulated gev lightcurve shows larger delayed onset and longer tail than that in the usual leptonic models ( fig.[f4 ] ) .",
    "the hadronic models usually require a much larger energy of protons than observed gamma - rays except for some examples such as grb 090902b . some may consider that the leptonic ssc models seem rather reasonable to reproduce both the gev and kev excesses .",
    "however , a lower magnetic field and high lorentz factor , required to make an optically thin source for gev photons generated via ic emission , leads to a very high minimum lorentz factor ( @xmath28 ) for random motion of accelerated electrons .",
    "if all electrons are accelerated in internal shock regions , such a high value may be impossible .",
    "thus , the fraction of accelerated electrons should be small in leptonic models to explain _",
    "fermi_-lat grbs .    on the contrary ,",
    "the minimum lorentz factor of electrons @xmath29 in the external ic model should be small to adjust the energy of scattered photons . given the total energy , such small @xmath29 means large number of electrons . if the numbers of electrons and protons are the same , the proton energy becomes fairly large ( @xmath30 erg in the case of fig.[f4 ] , while the luminosity of the band component @xmath22 ) .",
    "to enhance the emission efficiency , electron - positron plasma should be introduced in such models .    despite the ability of our straightforward simulations to reproduce various observed properties of the grb prompt emission",
    ", the discrepancy with the low - energy index @xmath31 remains unexplained .",
    "the injected electrons cool via synchrotron radiation , and distribute below @xmath29 with a power - law index @xmath32 .",
    "the resultant photon index becomes @xmath33 , while the observed typical values are @xmath34 or harder .",
    "the low - energy photon index affects the photomeson production efficiency .",
    "we have also tried to resolve this problem @xcite considering continuous acceleration / heating due to magnetic turbulences induced via various types of instabilities such as richtmyer - meshkov instability @xcite .",
    "the acceleration / heating balances with the synchrotron cooling , so the observed low - energy spectral index is naturally explained .",
    "such effect should be included in the time - dependent code to reproduce the global shape of the grb prompt spectra from ev to gev .",
    "especially , electron injection due to hadronic processes and succeeding acceleration by turbulences may explain very high @xmath29 and gev emission .",
    "we plan to develop the time - dependent code shown here to treat hadronic processes or continuous acceleration / heating .",
    "note that the results for the hadronic models shown here were calculated based on the steady state approximation .",
    "we will carry out simulations for various situations involving dissipative photospheres and internal or external dissipation or shock regions . moreover , the code will be useful for simulating emissions of other high - energy sources , such as active galactic nuclei , supernova remnant , and clusters of galaxies .",
