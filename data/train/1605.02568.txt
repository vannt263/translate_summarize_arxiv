    "in this part , i would like to ask the reader to make abstraction of any knowledge about what might be a `` good '' ruler , in particular , modern approaches like the wavelength of a particular atomic transition or more antiquated ones like some piece of metal located close to paris .",
    "the purpose here is one of example .",
    "the obvious point to make ( and this came in discussions with franois englert when we were preparing a freshman physics course ) is that it is impossible to say a priori which choice of ruler is best . to put things in a nutshell",
    ", we can only test the `` constancy '' ( a desirable property for a ruler ) of a particular ruler by comparison to another one ! ( and even in this process , assumptions are made about the fact that the length does not change during the translations and rotations needed to bring the two candidates alongside ) .",
    "if more illustration is needed , we could ( from everyday experience , comparing to many different objects around us ) imagine that a piece of wood would be a good ruler in a desert , where the day / night temperatures differ widely , but where the humidity is constant , while a piece of metal would constitute a `` better choice '' in , say , belgium .",
    "even measuring the temperature to compensate for such effects would rely on another `` ruler '' , the scale of the thermometer ! this digression was probably unneeded , but it still hints at one thing : we expect a `` good ruler '' to provide some consistency , when applied to a large number of independent measurements of objects we expect to be reasonably stable ... thus the result of a collection of measurements , or , as we shall see , the simplicity of the laws resulting from the choice of a particular ruler leads to which decide on its quality .",
    "still , on which basis are we to judge the `` simplicity '' ?    to illustrate the process in a willingly caricatural ( but , i think , instructive ) situation , i will take an extreme case : since no ruler is `` a priori '' better than another , let us choose a rubber band as our standard of length .",
    "armed with this new tool ( or experimentalist toy ) , we now want to perform some measurements . in this caricatural example , i suggest that we measure the length of a table every hour over a period of , say , 2 days ( in fact , this regularity is not necessary , we just need a sufficient number of measurements over a relatively long time ) . due to a lack of funding ( hard to understand ) for this project , and a similar lack of volunteers , i will just provide here some `` simulated '' measurements .",
    "( your collaboration is welcome in the future ! )    we present these measurements in figure [ table ]        for a physicist , this set of data seems difficult to exploit .",
    "it may have some interest for a psychologist or zoologist , who may want to relate this to the circadian rhythms , but does not suggest the obvious predictability that we expect from a `` physical law '' . fortunately , since our experimenter was rather idle between measurements we asked him / her / it ( the latter applies , since we deal with virtual measurements ) to perform a second experiment . immediately after measuring the table , a marble was dropped from the exact heights of 40 rubber band units .",
    "we assume that no accidental errors need to be considered , and show the results in figure [ marble ] ; it is also assumed , for simplicity , that our experimenter has a `` good '' chronometer .",
    "the same comments would apply as to the usability of these data , but the trained eye of a physicist can not fail to notice ( anti- ) correlations between the graphs , ( the more so that we have ignored any accidental errors ) .",
    "it becomes then very tempting to plot one against the other , in a graph ( fall time from 40 rb vs length of table in rb ) , this yield figure [ vs ]        this time , we find something close to what we might expect to call a `` physical law '' ( think of the many `` nameofsomeone '' laws in your beginning physics course , which were just similar observations , .. ) .",
    "how do we recognize this ?",
    "one simple answer is that it is `` usable '' .",
    "at the difference of the previous curves , the regularity of this one suggests that interpolation would work . if given a `` table length '' we can predict the corresponding `` fall time '' .",
    "another thing that this graph suggests is that the `` rubber band '' no longer appears directly , it is merely in the parametric equations of the curve , as is the time at which the measure was made , but does not figure directly in the relation .",
    "this translate the fact that it is now a simple intermediary to relate the drop height of the marble to a fraction or multiple of the table length .",
    "it is then very tempting to just do away with the `` rubber band units '' , and to use the length of the table as a primary measurement .",
    "such a move will make full sense if a range of other measurements would indeed favour this choice .",
    "still it is remarkable that starting from a ( rather obviously inadequate ) tool , the physics itself guides us to a more suitable one .    at this point , i would like to comment on the process used .",
    "the choice of a unit of length was a pretext to discuss what we recognize as a `` physical law '' , and in the present context , it amounts to `` a law we can use to make predictions '' , but also a law which describes things in a `` simple '' way . by simple ,",
    "we mean simple for us to figure out , and to use .",
    "it would be interesting to think on how our own senses influence such a description .",
    "certainly the importance of our vision plays a rle ( see also the `` note added '' below ) .",
    "another remark is that the notion of `` simple '' must be qualified , and trying to establish laws on the ( subjective ) principle of `` simplicity '' alone may lead to problems ( think of the epicycles trap ... ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", we have learnt ( and the students still suffer a lot to learn ) to find `` simple '' the simplest formulation which allows for a correct description .",
    "as an example , consider this equation , which we all find one of the simplest possible : @xmath0    and think of the amount of explanation needed to explain this `` simple '' relation to an outsider ( who might read is as `` square fork = - m two fork '' ) ...",
    "( i chose the `` simplest possible '' expression as a reference to the `` best of all possible worlds '' as criticized by voltaire in a satire of leibnitz )      at the time of writing up these proceedings , i think of a possible additional remark .",
    "imagine that , instead of plotting 2-dimensional graphs , we had used the full machinery and made 3-dimensional representations ( time of data taking , length of table , fall time ) .",
    "with sufficient statistics , we would have noticed , after looking at a number of 3d plots , that all points fell on a single smooth surface ... would it have led to the same conclusions ? is a limited visual representation forcing us/ helping us through the search for correlations into the abstraction of laws ?",
    "remember how the `` perfect gases '' law @xmath1 was first taught as three separate 2-variables laws ...      the previous considerations were aimed at showing , on the basis of a caricatural example , how `` physical laws '' could be induced from observation with `` efficient prediction '' as a guiding principle ( others would call this `` elegance '' ) .",
    "meanwhile we mentioned that this `` efficiency '' was probably in some way subjective , depending on our senses or thought processes ( or mathematical / numerical tools available ) .",
    "an opposite view would consider pre - existing `` laws of nature '' , which are for us to * discover * ; pure mathematics being sometimes taken as such an example .",
    "whatever the approach ( and the choice will not be clear until we have a `` full description '' ) , empirical verification ( or inspiration ) remains the fundamental tenet of physics .",
    "( think of the observation of parity violation in particle physics , which was difficult to expect on the basis of `` elegance '' , although it can be justified after the fact by the use of the smallest representations of @xmath2 .",
    "this section is completely different from the previous one , although it shares a common point : our perception of the metric of the space surrounding us .",
    "while i may differ with philippe spindel s approach in the previous version , the present one evokes some work performed in common with him , together with franois englert and marianne rooman .",
    "it starts from the question : what if the microscopic space structure is discontinuous ? how would we perceive it at long distances ? is the isotropy / symmetry of space a microscopic notion , or simply the result of re - summing a large number of steps to reach our observation scale ?",
    "this work was based on the idea of fractals , the reason being their self - similar structure at all scales . for technical details",
    ", we send back to the original reference @xcite and for a more sketchy presentation to @xcite .          assuming some microscopic structure , the fractal is an elegant solution in that it does not really need an intrinsic scale , but rather relies on a self - similar structure at every scale . a typical example involving 2 dimensions",
    "is the subdivision of a triangle , as shown in figure [ fractaloveral ] . at each level , the sides of a triangle are cut in a number of pieces ( here , 3 ) , and only the `` upward - pointing '' surfaces are kept .",
    "the number of subdivisions is kept the same at each level , providing thus a self - simiilar structure ( after `` trivial '' rescaling , it is impossible to determine at which fractalisation level one is . ) .",
    "on such a structure , it is possible to define a geometry , by fixing the `` length '' of the links .",
    "one can then , at a given fractalisation level write the equivalent of the ( discretized ) laplace equation , ( second derivatives being replaced by finite differnces ) .        from this equation , we now want to see whether we can easily spot the discontinuous or fractal structure of the space , through measurements .",
    "first of all , we must realize that the structure we are dealing with , even at a single fractalisation level , differs fundamentally from a lattice .    in a lattice",
    "indeed , if we move sufficiently far from a charge , a growing number of nodes participate in the equations , in other tems , the `` flux '' emitted by the charge is spread more or less evenly on a large perimeter , which grows with the distance , precisely which leads in 3 dimensions to the @xmath6 behaviour , and to the vanishing of the field at infinite distance .",
    "nothing like this here : at each step of the fractalisation , the entire flux is concentrated at the summits of the `` large triange '' . in fact , it becomes impossible to define the problem by an isolated charge inside the triangle alone , without specifying how the flux is shared among the summits .",
    "we have performed this calculation for various types of subdivision , ( n being the number of subdivision of a side , we had to resort to numerical calculations for larger n ) , and checked that indeed ( at least for symmetrical outgoing flux ",
    "what we could call `` mirror charges '' ) , the solution was close to the continuum one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f ] .",
    "the link to the first part of this contribution occurs through rescaling .",
    "assume that the metric is known at some fractalisation stage @xmath8 , and that we want to move one step up ( to larger structure , we will call this level @xmath9 ) .",
    "we want now to ignore the finer subdivision , and see which new metric we need to use .",
    "how will we define the new metric ? in a close analogy with the lines of the first section , we will rely on a physical phenomenon , namely the field corresponding to a local charge ( think of the electric field for an electrostatic charge , or , in minkowski space , an electromagnetic wave amplitude ) . by the way , this is close to the current definition of the meter , based on the length travelled by light in a unit of time !",
    "we thus study how the coefficients @xmath10 evolve from one level to the other .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume a symmetry between two of the coefficients , namely @xmath11 and , at the larger stage we get ( we explicitly rescale one of the coefficients , as this measuring scale is arbitrary , and we are mainly interested in the evolution of the ratio of the lenghts ) : @xmath12      the interest of this equation appears when we apply the rescaling in a recursive way , namely moving to larger and larger distances , and forgetting about the microscopic structure . in this process",
    ", we look for a fixed point , which would describe a large - scale tendency .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fixed ]                  the picture then becomes obvious by contemplating ( or measuring ) the following resistor lattice ( composed of @xmath15 and @xmath16 resistors ) . while the horizontal path offers little resistance , and is in parallel with much larger resistance shunts , the opposite is true for one of the other sides : an obvious large resistance of @xmath17 is shunted by numerous lower - resistance paths . as a result ,",
    "when we look on the large scale , we tend to equalize the behaviour in the 2 directions .",
    "this argument also explains the attractive nature of the fixed point , as the process continues as long as the `` direct '' path offers more resistance than its alternatives .",
    "i do nt want to make conclusions here ( they are quite obvious from the text ) , except that there is room for thought as to how much of the physical laws are defined by our measuring choices , and , ultimately , our thought process , which they in turn condition .",
