    "quantum effects such as entanglement and matter interference are predicted cornerstones of future technologies .",
    "their exploitation requires the ability to reliably and accurately control complex quantum systems .",
    "a major obstacle is that a quantum system can never completely be isolated from its environment and the interaction with the environment causes decoherence  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for condensed phase settings as encountered in , e.g. , solid state quantum devices .",
    "a number of concepts , such as decoherence - free subspaces  @xcite and noiseless subsystems  @xcite , dynamical decoupling  @xcite and spectral engineering  @xcite , have been developed to cope with decoherence .",
    "the applicability of these strategies is tied to specific conditions on the interaction between system and environment and , in practice , is often limited to systems that can be described by simple models . for complex quantum systems , numerical optimal control offers an alternative approach .",
    "it calculates the external controls that implement a desired target operation by performing an iterative search in the parameter space of the controls  @xcite .    for quantum systems that are subject to decoherence , numerical optimal control",
    "was first employed to realize laser cooling of internal degrees of freedom in molecules  @xcite .",
    "further applications , also utilizing a markovian master equation to describe the open system dynamics , include controlling coherences  @xcite , automatic protection against noise  @xcite , selective photoexcitation of charge transfer  @xcite , electric current in a molecular junction  @xcite , quantum gates  @xcite , and quantum memories  @xcite . due to the formal equivalence between markovian dissipation and quantum measurements , optimized observations can be determined using the same set of tools  @xcite .",
    "numerical optimal control can also be applied to non - markovian quantum systems  @xcite provided the dynamics can be calculated with sufficient efficiency .",
    "the question of numerical effort becomes particularly important in the optimization of high - fidelity quantum gates .",
    "high fidelities , or small errors , are best achieved with monotonically convergent optimization algorithms that utilize gradient information and thus require repeated forward and backward propagation  @xcite .",
    "gate optimization under coherent dynamics implies propagation of a set of states that span the hilbert ( sub)space on which the target is defined  @xcite . for open system dynamics , this was generalized to a set of states that span the corresponding liouville ( sub)space  @xcite .",
    "it requires not only propagation of density matrices instead of wavefunctions but also a significantly larger number of states since liouville space dimension is the square of hilbert space dimension .",
    "realistically , this limits quantum gate optimization to but the simplest examples , i.e. , one - qubit and two - qubit operations .    the direct extension from hilbert to liouville space  @xcite overlooks the fact that in quantum gate optimization the target is a unitary operation and not a general dynamical map .",
    "the latter would indeed require a basis that spans the full liouville space .",
    "however , much less information is required to assess how well a desired unitary is implemented .",
    "this observation is not only relevant for optimal control but also provides the basis for all current attempts at reducing the resources for estimating the average gate error  @xcite .",
    "in fact , only two states are necessary to distinguish any two unitaries , irrespective of hilbert space dimension  @xcite .",
    "we show here that these two states , together with a third state enforcing the dynamical map on the optimization subspace to be contracting and population conserving , can be utilized to construct an optimization functional which attains its optimal value only if the desired gate is implemented with unit fidelity .",
    "the two states that are required for unitary identification are constructed such that the first one consists of non - degenerate contributions from each hilbert ( sub)space direction .",
    "this corresponds to choosing a basis , and probing the gate error within this basis . in order to determine the error of gates that are diagonal in the chosen basis , i.e. , phase errors ,",
    "the second state is needed . for hamiltonians which due to their inherent structure allow for nothing but diagonal gates , only the second state together with the third one , enforcing the dynamical map on the optimization subspace to be contracting and norm conserving , is required . in our application , we thus distinguish between gates which are diagonal and those that are non - diagonal in the logical basis .",
    "our optimization functional is closely related to the gate error . while two states represent the minimal set of states required to distinguish any two unitaries , it is impossible to deduce bounds on the gate error from the two states  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the state corresponding to the choice of basis being a totally mixed thermal state .",
    "numerical bounds on the gate error can be derived when replacing the totally mixed state by a set of @xmath1 pure states where @xmath1 is the dimension of hilbert space , i.e. , by choosing a separate basis state for each hilbert space direction  @xcite .",
    "the resulting set consists of @xmath2 states .",
    "analytical bounds are obtained when also the second state of the minimal set is expanded  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding set is built out of the @xmath3 states of two mutually unbiased bases  @xcite .",
    "this observation from process verification motivates the choice of optimization functionals which utilize these extended sets of states .",
    "although the number of states then depends on hilbert space dimension , this choice still comes with very significant savings in the computational resources .",
    "for example , already for a two - qubit gate , both @xmath3 and @xmath2 represent a significant reduction in the number of states that need to be propagated , namely a reduction from 16 for the full liouville space basis to 8 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we demonstrate below that two states are sufficient to optimize diagonal gates and three states to optimize non - diagonal two - qubit gates .",
    "we also show that , depending on the desired gate error , @xmath2 , respectively @xmath3 states in the optimization functional correspond to the numerically most efficient choice .",
    "we consider a controlled phasegate with neutral trapped atoms that are excited into a rydberg state and a @xmath0gate with superconducting qubits . in both examples ,",
    "our optimization identifies gate implementations for which the error is limited by decoherence .",
