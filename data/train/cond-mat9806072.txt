    "laterally modulated superconductors have been intensively studied during the past few years ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the interest towards these materials was stimulated by the advances in the microfabrication techniques which enabled the production of sub - micron structures with the relevant dimensions of the order of the superconducting coherence length , @xmath6 and penetration depth @xmath7 .",
    "these microstructures impose certain constraints on the behaviour of the superconducting order parameter by confining the superconducting condensate within the sample s boundaries , including those introduced through lateral nanostructuring .",
    "superconducting wire networks and josephson junction arrays ( jja s ) are some examples of the laterally modulated films , where the applied magnetic field provides a continuously changing length scale which can explore commensurability between the lattice of vortices and the underlying artificially introduced lateral lattice @xcite .    in networks ,",
    "fluxoid quantization governs the properties and defines the allowed quantum states .",
    "circular currents ( vortices ) are induced around the cells forming the structure , thus defining sets of specific vortex configurations .",
    "recently , a new class of superconducting systems was introduced , consisting of a regular pinning array formed by a lattice of antidots ( i.e. submicron holes ) made in a type - ii superconducting film @xcite . at temperatures close to @xmath8 superconductors with an antidot lattice",
    "behave like weakly coupled wire networks @xcite , where vortex depinning dominates the dissipation @xcite .",
    "well below the transition temperature , where the fluxoid quantization condition implies flux quantization at the antidots , new features appear in the magnetization @xcite , critical currents @xcite and s / n phase boundaries @xcite which have been attributed to the formation of multiquanta vortices at the antidots .",
    "taking into account the vortex - vortex interactions in samples with @xmath9 antidots is , however , not a simple exercise due to the very large number of the interacting vortices . from this point of view , @xmath10 ( @xmath0 , @xmath11 , etc . ) with a small number of interacting vortices is a very promising  intermediate  system between a single superconducting loop with a finite strip width and a superconducting film with a huge array of antidots . at the same time , using finite microdots with four antidots ( the antidot cluster ) , we still keep the most essential features of the vortex - vortex interactions in presence of antidots .",
    "the reduced number of interacting vortices simplifies exact calculations which can also be extrapolated for the analysis of the vortex behaviour in substantially larger antidot arrays .    in this paper",
    ", we study the transport properties of such a model superconducting microsquare containing four antidots .",
    "further on , for simplicity , we shall call this structure a  @xmath0 antidot cluster  . this system can be considered as four unit cells of the regular square lattice of antidots and the initial simplicity makes the @xmath0 antidot cluster a good candidate for achieving an insight into the stable vortex configurations expected for larger systems .",
    "only a very limited number of vortex configurations are allowed for the @xmath0 antidot cluster and therefore both the experimental results are less difficult to be interpreted and also a computational analysis is easier to perform .",
    "additionally , the limited number of vortex configurations makes these structures also interesting for flux logic applications @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on measurements of the superconducting / normal ( s / n ) phase boundary , the magnetoresistance , the critical currents and the @xmath4 characteristics of a superconducting microsquare with four antidots .",
    "these experimental results have been compared with calculations in the london limit of the ginzburg - landau theory and in the framework of the de gennes - alexander model@xcite .",
    "the comparison has demonstrated that several well defined vortex configurations can be induced in these samples by properly tuning the magnetic field and the temperature . at very low transport currents ,",
    "only four of these configurations are stable . by increasing the transport current ,",
    "however , other flux phases , which are unstable without transport current , can be realized .",
    "based on the @xmath12 characteristics data , we also consider how the occupation of antidots by vortices influences the onset of dissipation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : exp ] describes the sample preparation , the experimental techniques and characteristic superconducting parameters of the pb / cu 2@xmath132 antidot cluster . in section  [ sec : phasbo ] , we present the results on the s / n phase boundary @xmath14 for the @xmath0 antidot cluster and a reference superconducting microsquare without antidots .",
    "the calculation of the s / n phase boundary for the 2@xmath132 antidot cluster in the london limit and in the framework of the de gennes - alexander model @xcite is described and compared with the experimental data .",
    "the discussion of possible effects of disorder is also presented .",
    "section  [ sec : critcur ] comprises the experimental results of the critical currents and @xmath4 characteristics .",
    "the @xmath4 data are used to determine the dissipation related to the vortex motion in the 2@xmath132 antidot cluster .",
    "the 2@xmath132 antidot clusters consisting of microsquares of 2@xmath132 @xmath15 with four antidots ( i.e. submicron holes of 0.53@xmath130.53 @xmath16 and center to center distance of 1 @xmath17 ) were written by e - beam lithography in positive pmma resist onto sio@xmath18 substrates .",
    "afterwards , a bilayer consisting of 50 nm thick pb and 17 nm thick cu was evaporated in one single run in a mbe apparatus at pressures of 5@xmath19 torr .",
    "the sio@xmath18 substrates were n@xmath18 cooled during evaporation which decreased the film roughness down to 1.4 nm and suppressed the interdiffusion at the pb / cu interface @xcite .",
    "after the lift - off processing , the samples were characterized by x - ray , afm and sem .",
    "the x - ray results show that the pb / cu bilayers are polycrystalline with a preferential growth of the pb and cu in the ( 111 ) direction .",
    "an afm picture of the 2@xmath132 antidot cluster of pb / cu with four leads attached for electrical connection , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : afm]a . also shown ( fig .  [",
    "fig : afm]b ) is the afm image of a reference sample which consists of a pb(50 nm)/cu(17 nm ) microsquare of 2@xmath132 @xmath20 without antidots .",
    "the top cu layer of 17 nm , evaporated onto the pb film , was used to protect the pb film from oxidation and to enable electrical connection to the experimental apparatus using a wire bonding technique through the 150@xmath21150 @xmath20 electrical pads of the sample . besides that , the cu layer changes also the coherence length and the penetration depth of the pb layer .",
    "we discuss the influence of this cu layer on the superconducting properties of the pb / cu bilayers in terms of proximity induced superconductivity in the next section .",
    "the electrical transport properties were measured in a @xmath22he cryostat using the four probe technique .",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the film surface and the temperature stabilization was better than 0.4 mk .",
    "since the mesoscopic samples are very sensitive and easily destroyed by electrostatic charges , all necessary grounding precautions were taken and 1.2 k@xmath23 resistors were connected in series with each lead to damp parasitic voltage peaks .",
    "the resistance measurements where performed using an ac - resistance bridge whereas the @xmath4 characteristics and critical current measurements where carried out using a dc - power supply and a nanovoltmeter .",
    "the superconducting / normal ( s / n ) phase boundary was determined automatically by keeping the sample resistance at a specific fixed value ( usually at 10 % of the normal state resistance ) and varying the magnetic field and temperature .",
    "similarly , the critical current measurements as function of field were performed by keeping the sample at a certain fixed voltage and varying the applied current and magnetic field .      in order to study the pb(50 nm)/cu(17 nm ) bilayer which was used for the 2@xmath242 antidot clusters , we prepared also a single pb(50 nm ) and cu(17 nm ) film and measured their properties .",
    "below , we present the summary of these results .    comparing the resistivity due to electron - phonon scattering , for the pb(50 nm ) film , @xmath25 = 27.8 @xmath26 and for the @xmath27 nm cu thin films @xmath25 = 12.47 @xmath26 , with the published bulk values of and respectively @xcite , we conclude that the resistivity of the pb film approaches the bulk value whereas the resistivity of the cu film is enhanced with respect to the bulk value due to the finite size effect @xcite . the mean free paths at 7k determined from the resistivity values are @xmath28 = 33 nm and @xmath29 = 7.2 nm respectively .",
    "thus , both single films , pb ( 50 nm ) and cu ( 17 nm ) are in the dirty limit since @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite respectively , where @xmath32 = 83 nm is the bcs coherence length of the pb @xcite and @xmath33 at 7 k is a dimensionless impurity parameter .",
    "the superconducting properties of the s layer are characterized by two important lengths , the temperature dependent coherence length , @xmath34 and the penetration depth , @xmath35 = @xmath36 in the dirty limit . here",
    "@xmath37 is the london penetration depth . for the pb ( 50 nm )",
    "film at @xmath38= 0 k , these two quantities take the values @xmath39 = 45 nm and @xmath40 = 39 nm , respectively .",
    "experimentally , we can also determine @xmath39 from the relation between the perpendicular second critical field @xmath41 in a s layer and its in - plane superconducting coherence length , @xmath42 , given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the flux quantum .",
    "the coherence length obtained in this way is @xmath39=36 nm .",
    "now , we can determine the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath45 and since @xmath46 we conclude that the single pb layer is a type - ii superconductor .    by covering the pb with a cu layer",
    ", a superconducting pb / cu bilayer is obtained with different characteristic parameters than those of the single pb film .",
    "we therefore define the effective superconducting parameters as the ones that can be determined from measurements on a pb / cu bilayer .",
    "the pb / cu antidot clusters had a superconducting transition temperature , @xmath47k , whereas the reference sample ( i.e. square of 2@xmath132 @xmath15 without antidots ) had a @xmath48k .",
    "the systematic difference in critical temperature between the perforated and reference sample is probably related to a difference of the electrical properties of the interface between the pb and cu layers .",
    "the possibility for an oxidation at the pb / cu interface is higher in perforated samples .",
    "this results in a smaller proximity coupling and , possibly , a higher effective critical temperature .",
    "nevertheless , it is obvious that in both cases the top cu layer decreases @xmath49 below the @xmath50k of the bulk pb due to the proximity effect @xcite .    from the measured critical fields of the pb(50 nm)/cu(17 nm ) bilayer , we determined an effective superconducting coherence length as @xmath51=39 nm , using eq .",
    "[ eq : perpb ] .    one may expect that an effective penetration depth for the ( ns ) bilayer , @xmath52 could also be defined .",
    "especially , since there should exist a penetration depth , @xmath53 , determining the decay of the magnetic field in the normal layer with proximity coupling , which should be different from @xmath54 .",
    "the exact definition of these two quantities , @xmath53 and @xmath55 , is not obvious .",
    "since we know that @xmath56 , we will estimate a lower limit for @xmath55 as @xmath57 nm .",
    "further in the paper ( see section  [ sec : iv ] ) , a more accurate estimate for @xmath55 will be given .",
    "with this information , we can determine a lower limit for the effective ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath58/@xmath59 as 1 for the pb(50 nm)/cu(17 nm ) bilayer . since @xmath60 the pb / cu bilayer is a type - ii superconductor .    as shown above , by covering pb with a thin cu layer , we are not only protecting the former against oxidation , but we are also changing , in certain limits , the effective @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "pb / cu bilayers are good candidates for studying proximity coupling effects @xcite between a superconductor ( s ) and a normal metal ( n ) since interdiffusion hardly exists at the interface of these materials , especially when they are evaporated at low temperature .",
    "therefore , each material remains within its own boundaries .",
    "the proximity effect refers to the induction of superconductivity in a contacting normal metal by the decay of the superconducting order parameter , @xmath63 , from a superconductor into a normal metal .",
    "not only the order parameter in the superconductor decays when approaching the s / n interface from the superconducting size but also a non vanishing superconducting order parameter nucleates in the n layer close to the interface .",
    "thus , one of the most important parameters defining the proximity effect between two layers is the so - called coherence length of the normal layer , @xmath64 , which determines the length in the normal metal over which cooper pairs can diffuse ( see fig  [ fig : prox ] ) . in the dirty limit and for our cu parameters , @xmath65 = 28 nm at 6 k , where @xmath66 is the fermi velocity of cu .",
    "note that @xmath67 where @xmath68 = 17 nm is the cu thickness , which means that the superconducting order parameter is finite over the full thickness of the cu layer in the temperature interval at which experiments on the pb / cu antidot cluster were performed ( 5 k @xmath69 6 k ) .",
    "another very interesting parameter in proximity induced superconductivity is the extrapolation length , @xmath70 = 98 nm at 6 k in the dirty limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : prox ] ) , where @xmath71 .",
    "this parameter @xmath72 is a measure of the unfavourable influence of the n layer on the superconductivity of the s layer . if @xmath73 the effects of proximity coupling are important whereas if @xmath74 the superconducting order parameter at the interface is almost not changed and the effects of proximity coupling are negligible . in our case at @xmath75k , @xmath72",
    "= 98 nm , @xmath76 = 108 nm , thus the proximity effect has an intermediate strength in the pb(50 nm)/cu(17 nm ) bilayer .",
    "we can classify our samples as being in the cooper limit since they fulfill the constraints @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in this limit",
    ", @xmath79 can be taken as a constant over the individual layers and discontinuous at the interface .",
    "the perpendicular second critical field , @xmath80 for a ( ns ) bilayer of thickness ( @xmath81 ) can then be determined from the second critical field of the single superconducting layer , @xmath41 , by the dirty limit expression , @xmath82 where @xmath83 for a specular scattering at the interface .",
    "this expression is in good agreement with our experimental results on bilayers with different cu thicknesses . in particular , for the bilayer pb(50 nm)/cu(17 nm ) used for the fabrication of the antidot cluster , eq.[eq : bc2 ] reduces to : @xmath84 with @xmath85=0.91 .",
    "experimentally , we have obtained @xmath85=0.86 which is in agreement with the calculated value within a 5% .",
    "taking into account that the scattering at the interface is probably not completely specular , the obtained agreement is quite good .",
    "combining eq .",
    "[ eq : perpb ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : bc2 ] , one can obtain the ratio between the superconducting coherence length for the pb(50 nm ) layer and that of the pb(50 nm)/cu(17 nm ) bilayer , @xmath86= 1.05 . using the value @xmath42= 36 nm for the pb(50 nm ) film , we expect , according to this relation , that @xmath87 = 38 nm for the pb(50 nm)/cu(17 nm ) bilayer film , which is within 5% agreement with the experimental value determined from the measured second critical fields of bilayers of that specific thickness , @xmath88=39 nm .    in summary , from the analysis of the superconducting properties of the pb / cu bilayer",

    "this dip shifts to higher magnetic fields when decreasing the temperature and is responsible for the oscillations observed in @xmath2 . on the contrary ,",
    "the two drops of resistance may be explained by the influence of the four narrow superconducting leads which are attached to the microsquare ( two for sending the transport current and two to measure the voltage ) . these leads are quasi - one - dimensional wires and therefore they become superconducting below the field .",

    "the @xmath182 dependence for the states with all @xmath160 or all @xmath183 thus seems steeper than predicted by the theoretical model and it also has a larger amplitude .",
    "strangely , the agreement with the theoretical curve , which is calculated for zero transport current , is better in curve ( @xmath179 ) , where the highest transport current was used .",
    "in addition , the experimental @xmath182 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : psbexp1 ] ) shows a considerable parabolic background , some distortions and a disappearance of the substructure above @xmath184 .",
    "as it was mentioned previously , the parabolic background (  diamagnetic shift  ) is due to the penetration of the magnetic field in the volume of the wires @xcite and can be taken into account by adding the term  : @xmath185 to the right hand side of eq .",

    "[ fig : psbexp1 ] ) . taking into account the  softness  of the current loops in a real structure , which , strictly speaking , is not a one dimensional network , the presence of disorder of these loops is quite probable .",
    "therefore , one may assume that one of the reasons of the variation of the @xmath195(@xmath144/@xmath192 ) peaks from period to period can be related to an areal disorder of  soft  current loops in the 2@xmath132 antidot cluster .",
    "another important factor is the disorder arising from width inhomogeneity , structural defects , non identical electrical properties of each wire , which can lead to a modification of the critical current of the individual wires and to a distribution of the effective area per cell .",
    "the importance of areal disorder was already stressed in studies of the phase boundary in wire networks @xcite where it was shown that areal disorder can lead to a decay of the oscillation amplitudes and in some cases even to beatings in the envelope .",
    "measurements on josephson junction clusters ( jjc s ) @xcite showed that coupling disorder coming from an unavoidable spread in junction parameters is not averaged out as in large arrays , leaving a clear trace in the transport properties .",
    "curve  @xmath196 in fig .",
    "[ fig : psbdis ] shows the influence of areal disorder on the theoretical phase boundary of the antidot cluster .",
    "the areal disorder was introduced by allowing the coordinates of the nodes to vary randomly within a circle of radius 0.1 @xmath17 around the node position for the ordered network . in this way a random distribution of lengths @xmath197 and cell areas is generated which lifts the degeneracy of the possible states and changes the relative positions of the different parabolic energy branches . for small fields ( i.e. the first period ) , the deviations with respect to curve @xmath188 are not very pronounced and it is still possible to identify all five parabolae forming the @xmath2 phase boundary .",
    "as the field increases , the oscillation amplitude gets smaller and the positions of the different branches shift , making the identification of the states less straightforward . from this analysis",
    "it is clear that disorder can indeed cause a shift of the peaks with increasing magnetic field , as it is observed experimentally .",
    "finally , in curve ( @xmath134 ) we have included the contributions of the parabolic background ( curve ( @xmath72 ) ) and the areal disorder ( curve ( @xmath179 ) ) . a comparison of curve ( @xmath134 ) with the experimental data of fig .",
    "[ fig : psbexp1 ] shows that certainly these two contributions are playing a role in our measurements .",
    "nevertheless , even by including these two effects in the model , it is still not possible to simulate the experimental curves completely .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that we have used a one - dimensional approach , which can not take into account the 2d character of the structure .",
    "so far we have considered the effects of the vortex confinement by the 2@xmath242 antidot cluster on the s / n phase boundary @xmath2 . in order to demonstrate that the unique properties of the pb / cu 2@xmath132 antidot cluster are not restricted to the s / n phase transition , we present below the critical current results and the @xmath4 characteristics measured at temperatures .",
    "we will show that at these temperatures the quantized states are still present and that the most stable ones at the s / n phase boundary do not always correspond to the states carrying the highest currents .",
    "in addition , we will demonstrate that a transport current @xmath198 0 is able to lift some of the degeneracies of the vortex configurations at @xmath133 = 0 .",
    "the @xmath4 characteristics will be used to give a qualitative picture of the flux line transport in these nanostructures in terms of phase - slip processes .",
    "it is known that the dynamics of 1d wires @xcite and arrays of 1d wires @xcite are mostly governed by phase - slip processes when currents close to the depairing critical current are sent through the wires .",
    "thus , one may also expect that signatures of these processes should also be present in the @xmath4 characteristics of the 2@xmath132 antidot cluster .",
    "in such a phase - slip process the energy of the system is reduced by bringing a small spot of the 1d wire ( of the order of the quasiparticle diffusion length , @xmath199 ) momentarily to the normal state . during this process ,",
    "the phase of the superconducting order parameter in that spot is changed by 2@xmath200 .",
    "to preserve the superconductivity in the sample in the presence of a large current , the phase - slip process repeats in time and the average period @xmath201 between phase - slips is related to the voltage measured between the two ends of the wire through the josephson relation , @xmath202 .",
    "the points where the order parameter becomes zero and its phase shows jumps of 2@xmath200 , are known as phase - slip centres ( psc ) .",
    "obviously , if the wire already has some weak superconducting points , the psc s will be localized at these spots .",
    "several mechanisms of psc formation have been reported .",
    "first , psc s can nucleate when the current exceeds the depairing critical current of the 1d wire , as described by the theory of skocpol , beasley and tinkham ( sbt)@xcite . in this case",
    "the formation of 1,2, ",
    "n psc s gives rise to a step - like @xmath4 characteristic .",
    "psc s can also be formed as a result of thermodynamic fluctuations which take place with a probability proportional to @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the free energy barrier between the state before and after the phase - slip .",
    "the theoretical description of psc s was developed by langer and ambegoakar ( la ) @xcite .",
    "taking into account the exponential decrease of the phase - slip probability with temperature , their model is only applicable in a very narrow temperature interval near @xmath8 .",
    "a third mechanism has recently been reported by giroud _",
    "@xcite for arrays of 1d wires with localized vortices .",
    "they consider the possibility that when a current close to the depairing critical current is reached in one of the wires , the vortex feels a  lorentz - like  force perpendicular to the transport current , which tends to move the vortex to the next cell where the process is repeated .",
    "this model assumes the nucleation of a phase - slip in a 1d wire each time that a vortex crosses the 1d wire .",
    "the critical current density versus magnetic field , @xmath3 , of the 2@xmath242 antidot cluster was determined with a criterium of 3@xmath205 as explained in section  [ sec : prepchar ] .",

    "besides this influence of the current leads at high current levels , care should also be taken not to overestimate the limits of validity of the static simulation itself . unlike the case of jja s where the dynamics can relatively easy be taken into account by using the resistively shunted josephson junction ( rsj ) model in combination with the josephson voltage relation @xcite , it is not so straightforward to describe the dynamics in wire networks where resistive psc s nucleate and can be activated throughout the structure .",

    "<S> we present a detailed study of the transport properties of a superconducting pb / cu microdot with a @xmath0 antidot cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting - normal ( s / n ) phase boundary , critical currents and current - voltage characteristics of this structure have been measured . the s / n phase boundary as a function of field @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) reveals an oscillatory structure caused by the limited number of possible vortex configurations which can be realized in these small clusters of pinning centres ( antidots ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed the stability of these configurations and discussed the possible dissipation mechanisms using the critical current ( @xmath3 ) and voltage - current ( @xmath4 ) characteristics data . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the experimental data of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with calculations in the london limit of the ginzburg - landau theory confirms that vortices can indeed be pinned by the antidots forming a cluster and that the ground - state configurations of the vortices are noticeably modified by sending current through the structure . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of generating phase - slips as well as motion of the vortices in the @xmath0 antidot cluster has also been discussed .    </S>",
