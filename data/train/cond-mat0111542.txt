    "the temperature dependence of the in - plane longitudinal electrical conductivity @xmath4 ( @xmath5 the transport scattering rate ) , being widely observed in optimally doped high-@xmath1 cuprates , can be understood based on the marginal - fermi - liquid ( mfl ) hypothesis @xcite . in this phenomenological theory ,",
    "the mfl behavior of quasiparticles follows from the interaction between electrons and scale - invariant particle - hole excitation fluctuations . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "quasiparticles trajectories are bent by the magnetic lorentz force , resulting in a hall conductivity @xmath6 according to the standard boltzmann theory .",
    "this on its own is inconsistent with the experimental evidence @xmath7 observed in an optimally doped ybacuo sample @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal hall conductivity @xmath0 measured in _ another _ ybacuo sample shows a @xmath8 dependence @xcite , similar to an earlier experimental observation @xcite .",
    "the resulting hall - lorenz number @xmath9 indicates a violation of the hal wiedemann - franz law @xcite .",
    ".2 cm very recently , varma and abraham ( va ) @xcite proposed an intriguing explanation for the unusual @xmath2 in terms of mfl quasiparticles subject to out - of - plane impurities which sit between conducting cuo@xmath10 planes , most likely the deficient oxygens in cuo chains .",
    "va argued @xcite that the very existence of these impurities and their peculiar effects on the in - plane quasiparticle lifetime can be verified from the experimental angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data @xcite .",
    "the out - of - plane impurities differ from in - plane impurities by the fact that the former are forward scatterers and have negligible effect on @xmath11 .",
    "however , in the presence of a magnetic field , they impose an effective lorentz force on the quasiparticles when the quasiparticles have anisotropic scattering rates . as a result , in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", a nontrivial contribution to @xmath2 from the out - of - plane impurities is found , and shown to be proportional to @xmath12 , in addition to the customary @xmath13 term , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 , found in eq .",
    "( [ abc ] ) below , are dependent on the detailed band structure , and @xmath16 also depends on the out - of - plane impurity density and the angle dependence of the scattering from the impurities . for the ybacuo sample used in the experiments and in the temperature regimes where the measurements were made @xcite , the impurity term dominates over the customary term , leading to the observation @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this simple elegant idea was further shown to successfully explain the complex hall conductivity without any free parameters @xcite .",
    ".2 cm in this paper we address the temperature behavior of @xmath0 for the mfl quasiparticles under the scattering of the out - of - plane impurities .",
    "it is of particular interest to examine the wiedemann - franz law , which is only obeyed when the electrical heat and charge currents decay in the same way . in an ordinary metal",
    ", this is the case when an elastic scattering dominates .",
    "the presence of a momentum - dependent inelastic scattering may change this conclusion , as a forward inelastic scattering process may decay the heat current more strongly than it does the electrical current .",
    "such a violation of the wiedemann - franz law can usually be understood to be in association with the existence of ( an ) intrinsic energy scale(s ) in the inelastic scattering .",
    "a typical example lies in electron - phonon interaction in the case of which the wiedemann - franz law is violated for @xmath18 @xcite , with @xmath19 the debye temperature serving as the intrinsic energy scale . in the present problem , the remarkable property of the inelastic scattering leading to the mfl behavior is the absence of such an intrinsic energy scale .",
    "this along with the assumption that the normal - state band - structure density of states @xmath20 and group velocity @xmath21 are _ constant _ in energy leads to our following main finding in this paper . like @xmath2 ,",

    "i , however , that @xmath0 and @xmath2 were measured in two different ybacuo samples @xcite , which usually involve different impurity densities . in particular , the sample used in @xmath0 measurement @xcite is of a higher doping level , equivalent to the lower oxygen deficit in the cuo chains . taking the oxygen vacancies in the cuo chains to be the out - of - plane impurities ,",
    "we expect a weaker impurity scattering in this sample .",
    "it is therefore likely that with the _ smaller _ @xmath109 , @xmath0 shows a @xmath28 dependence closer to that of the customary term .",

    "we speculate that this corresponds to the impurity scattering strength in the slightly overdoped ybacuo sample used for the @xmath0 measurement .",
    "it is clear that to confirm this speculation a systematic experimental work is needed .",
    "an immediate suggestion is to examine @xmath2 in the slightly overdoped ybacuo sample , in which @xmath0 was measured , to see a possible customary behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "( 250,200 )    0.2 cm we have shown that both @xmath2 and @xmath0 are determined by a competition between the customary term and the unusual impurity term , which depends on the detailed band structure and the out - of - plane impurity scattering .",
    "there may also be an effect from the renormalization of the mass , the density of state , and the group velocity of the electrons by the coupling to the mfl fluctuations .",
    "however , as in the fermi - liquid case , this effect cancels out in @xmath2 and @xmath0 , leaving behind insignificant numerical prefactors of both the customary and unusual impurity terms .",
    "so we do not expect any qualitative change to the conclusion on the weak-@xmath28 dependence of @xmath27 in the _ same _ sample .",
    "0.2 cm finally , we address the effect , missing in the above discussion , of experimental boundary conditions in thermal conductivity measurements of no electric currents flowing through the samples .",
    "imposing such a boundary condition causes charge accumulation at the sample edges , generating an effective electric field on the electronic heat carriers . as a result ,",
    "both the thermal and thermal hall conductivities acquire correction terms @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the thermoelectric power and the nernst coefficient multiplied by the magnetic field , respectively . @xmath113 and",
    "@xmath114 have been studied independently in experiments @xcite .",
    "theoretically , they both require an odd - energy dependence of some combinations of @xmath21 , @xmath20 , and the inelastic scattering rate , and therefore vanish to the first - order approximation in the present model .",
    "exploring the temperature dependence of @xmath113 and @xmath114 by including higher - order terms in energy is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "@xcite thus the correction term in eq .",

    "the two correction terms in eq .",
    "( [ tildekxy ] ) turn out to be @xmath123 w / mk and @xmath124 w / mk , respectively . neglecting the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tildekxy ] ) , we set the temperature dependence of @xmath125 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the third term , and find that it increases the impurity @xmath13 term in @xmath0 slightly more than the customary @xmath126 term .",
    "therefore , our conclusion that @xmath0 and @xmath2 approximately obey the wiedemann - franz law in the _ same _ sample still holds .",
    "in summary , we have examined the thermal hall conductivity for mfl quasiparticles being scattered from the out - of - plane impurities , by following the phenomenological work on electrical hall conductivity in ref .",
    "we find that these impurities have very similar effects on both @xmath2 and @xmath0 , and the effective lorentz force they impose on the mfl quasiparticles depends weakly on the quasiparticle energy .",
    "this immediately leads to nearly the same temperature dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we argue that the different temperature behaviors of @xmath3 and @xmath2 observed in the experiments may originate from different samples being measured . in measuring @xmath0",
    "a slightly overdoped ybacuo sample was used which has fewer out - of - plane impurities and hence a dominant customary behavior of @xmath0 @xcite .",
