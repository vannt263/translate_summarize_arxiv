    "the protein folding process is relevant for all aspects of life : once read off from the rna chain , proteins perform a variety of functions , from mechanical work to attacking viruses .  @xcite the key factor which determines the function of a protein molecule is its 3d structure , which , in turn , is determined by the sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain .",
    "@xcite furthermore , a protein that has been denatured ( by stretching it for example ) finds its native state relatively quickly .",
    "protein folding has attracted an enormous amount of scientific attention , but still there is no generic understanding of this process .",
    "nevertheless , one thing is clear : a proteins generally has a potential energy surface which results in a stable free energy minimum , corresponding to the native state  @xcite .",
    "random heteropolymer models ( rhp ) have been used extensively as candidate systems which might help us to understand the generic features of the potential energy surfaces of proteins and their connection with thermodynamic  @xcite and dynamical  @xcite properties .",
    "the rhp model is characterized by quenched random monomer - monomer interactions , meant to mimic the variety of interactions between amino - acids in random sequences .",
    "it turns out that the potential energy surface of the rhp is quite similar to that of a particular class of spin glasses  @xcite : its complex form , with exponentially large numbers of local minima and saddle points , constrains the motion of the system drastically , and it can not explore its full configuration space and reach gibbs equilibrium . in a previous paper ( @xcite , henceforth referred to as paper i ) , we demonstrated , in mean field theory , the existence of a sharp transition to a `` dynamical glassy state '' in which the equilibration time diverges and the dynamics exhibit aging .",
    "( the potential importance of spin glass physics to proteins was first discussed in ref .",
    "obviously , the random heteropolymer model does not describe a protein with a native state , but it alerts us to the need to examine possible glassiness in models for protein dynamics .",
    "why are real proteins not glassy ? evidently , nature has tuned amino acid sequences to avoid glassy behavior . to understand how such tuning might be done ,",
    "it is worthwhile to study models which contain competition between glassiness and a tendency to form a native state , by choosing interactions which are not completely random .",
    "several studies along the lines of this suggestion have been made in _ statics _",
    "( using the replica treatment , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the tendency toward a particular state can be built in by choosing sequences from a distribution correlated with the native sequence @xcite .",
    "a dynamical treatment of similar models is highly desirable , not only to help gain insight into results obtained in replica approaches , but also because knowledge of the correct thermodynamics alone may not be sufficient : it is known that in related ( mean field models ) static and dynamic phase diagrams can be different .",
    "thus ( at least on sufficiently short time scales ) only a dynamical approach can describe the measurable properties of the system . in this paper",
    "we undertake such a study .",
    "we extend the rhp model studied in @xcite to include the existence of a native state : the original random monomer - monomer interactions are biased so as to favor the native state conformation .",
    "the problem is formulated as a langevin model . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is so far neither a static nor a dynamic treatment available for a model of this sort : static studies have been based on random monomer sequences , i.e. , using only @xmath5 random parameters , see refs .",
    "@xcite , rather than the @xmath6 in the rhp model .",
    "admittedly , the model does not describe a realistic protein ( e.g. , it does not give rise to secondary structure such as @xmath7-helices or @xmath8-sheets ) .",
    "however , it does contain important generic features : the polymeric structure and the mixture of attractive and repulsive interactions .",
    "together , these features lead to frustration in the structural dynamics . in our view , ours is the simplest such model that includes competition between glassy and native states . as we will see , it teaches us that one can not get rid of glassiness so easily .    as in paper",
    "i , we simplify the model further by omitting three - body interactions in the polymer .",
    "( a review describing how to include three - body terms is given in  @xcite . )",
    "the price we have to pay for this simplification is that we have to introduce a somewhat arbitrary confining potential , which we take to have a quadratic form .",
    "we adjust its strength so that the radius of gyration @xmath9 of a polymer of size @xmath5 scales like @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dimensionality of the system . in this way we attempt to describe a globular state",
    "of course , we can not describe the @xmath12-point transition in such a model , but here we are only interested in transitions between different globular states .",
    "our formal starting point is the martin - siggia - rose generating functional for the langevin dynamics of the model @xcite , written , for convenience and compactness , in its supersymmetric form @xcite . to derive equations of motion for correlation and response functions we use a variational ansatz with a quadratic action .",
    "this approach has been used to study the problem of a manifold in a random potential , in both statics @xcite and dynamics @xcite .",
    "in paper i we showed that the rhp model exhibited broken ergodicity ( formally , a spontaneous supersymmetry breaking ) in a low - temperature dynamical glassy phase . in the present study , with interactions biased in favor of a native state to a controlled degree , we find , in addition , a well - folded phase , if the bias is strong enough",
    ". it can coexist with either the disordered ( random - globule ) state or the frozen - globule glass phase , depending on the temperature .",
    "furthermore , we find that at low temperature the native phase can itself undergo a dynamical freezing into a different glassy phase . in this phase",
    "the conformation of the protein is always highly correlated with the native state , but cooperative kinetic constraints still lead to a divergent equilibration time , as for the frozen - globule state .",
    "the model is defined as follows .",

    "thus the symmetric bond distribution of the rhp model is distorted so as to give bigger weight to @xmath31 s which are attractive between monomers which lie close to each other in the configuration @xmath45 .",
    "explicitly , the properly normalized @xmath43 is given by @xmath46 from which we see that the distribution of @xmath31 is peaked around @xmath47 .",
    "thus , if monomers @xmath16 and @xmath42 are close in the native state ( @xmath48 ) , their coupling constant @xmath31 is pulled down , as in a go model @xcite . for @xmath49",

    "this confirms that the ansatz @xmath211 and @xmath212 leads to a melted random - globule - like phase .",
    "this phase is identical to that found at high temperatures for the completely random heteropolymer in paper i.    the validity of the present ansatz rests upon the fact that we can solve eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) . clearly , for @xmath203 a solution can always be found , namely @xmath213 .",
    "since the physically relevant @xmath29 is @xmath214 , we can always satisfy this equation , for any @xmath0 , in the limit @xmath215 .",
    "we now address briefly the question of what happens for finite @xmath5 ( and @xmath29 ) .",
    "one can easily see that eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) has two solutions when @xmath216 is not too large ( e.g. by plotting the left- and right - hand side as functions of @xmath7 ) .",
    "the solution close to 1 is lost when the slopes of the left- and right - hand sides become roughly equal . evaluating these slopes",
    "leads to the condition ( + 1)^ < 1 [ eq : coilcond ] for the existence of a random - globule - like state .",
    "some caution is in order . working this out for finite @xmath5 , @xmath217 , and an average density of @xmath218",
    ", we find that the inequality ( [ eq : coilcond ] ) is violated below a temperature t_x = ( ) ^1/2 n^-1/3 . with the small power of @xmath219 , one has to go to quite large @xmath5 to make this temperature very low .",
    "thus our statement that the random - globule - like state exists for all temperatures in the @xmath212 limit may be of limited relevance for real 3-dimensional heteropolymers of the length of typical proteins .",
    "nevertheless , here we are just considering this simple limit .",
    "we now discuss the stability of this solution . in the large-@xmath5 limit ,",
    "it is locally stable against spontaneous formation of a native - like state at any @xmath22 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is unstable against glass formation at low temperatures : since it is identical with the random - globule solution of the completely random heteropolymer problem , we can take over the result from paper i that it is unstable below a temperature @xmath220 , with the constant of proportionality of order 1 .",
    "this glass temperature is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "( in fig .  1 this is the transition at @xmath221 . ) thus ,",
    "wherever the system is in a random - globule - like state at @xmath222 , it will no longer equilibrate if the temperature is lowered below @xmath2 . instead",
    ", it will become glassy and its dynamics will show aging .      at low @xmath0 and @xmath22 , one expects that the polymer should be very close to its native state , i.e. , small @xmath174 .",
    "therefore we also look for such solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : tmu ] ) .",
    "we will try to solve equations ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : tmu ] ) in the limit where @xmath191 and @xmath177 stays finite .",
    "the limit @xmath203 turns out not to involve any subtleties when @xmath177 is kept constant , so we will just set @xmath223 from the outset .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : tmu ] ) become @xmath224 these equations can be solved for @xmath177 as function of @xmath22 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that @xmath203 has been taken .",
    "this implies that ( [ varphi ] ) and ( [ qterg ] ) become @xmath225 and , inserting ( [ varphiqt ] ) into ( [ costh ] ) , the normalized overlap between native state and polymer conformations , becomes @xmath226 .",
    "furthermore , because of its large overlap with the native state , the polymer is essentially frozen .",
    "this can be seen by calculating the normalized overlap between two polymer conformations after a very long time interval , as in previous section . inserting ( [ varphiqt ] ) into ( [ costh ] ) and ( [ q / qt ] ) gives @xmath227 .",
    "there is interesting behavior associated with the limit @xmath203 for very long polymers .",
    "when the polymer gets longer and longer ( @xmath77 ) a finite part of the chain is not in the native state conformation , since @xmath174 stays constant .",
    "the rest of the chain is in the native state , which can be seen from the fact that overlap with native state approaches 1 .",
    "thus , in the limit of a very long polymer , the fraction of chain not in the native state conformation becomes negligible : the recipe for biasing the coupling constants @xmath31 described in chapter ii works best for long polymers .    in the following",
    "we will proceed with the solution of equations ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tmu1 ] ) . before continuing",
    ", it will be useful to compactify notation a bit . making the change of variables @xmath228 for @xmath229 ; @xmath230 for @xmath231 ; and @xmath232 for @xmath233 , we get equations of the same form , with @xmath234 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 , but with @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we can choose units with @xmath239 and @xmath238 ( and remove the hats ) .",
    "from now on we do this .",

    "this can be easily done by inserting the expression for @xmath174 from eq .",

    "we want ultimately to construct a phase diagram in the @xmath243 plane .",
    "therefore we have to specify @xmath22 ( one panel of the figure ) and @xmath127 and ask whether one or more solutions , i.e. , particular values of @xmath177 which solve eq .",
    "( [ invt0tmu ] ) , exist .",
    "for example , in panel ( a ) in fig .  2 , a horizontal line at @xmath244 intersects @xmath242 curve at two places , indicating two solutions @xmath245",
    ". to make the figures more readable we have shown such a horizontal line , at a particular values of @xmath127 , only in panel ( a ) . if this horizontal line is moved below @xmath246 , it will never intersect the @xmath242 curve .",
    "thus , we can see that for every @xmath22 , there is a value @xmath247 below which no solutions exist .",
    "we proceed with the analysis of fig .  2 .",
    "for sufficiently high temperatures ( panels ( a)-(c ) ) there are exactly two solutions for all @xmath248 . of these , the one with the larger value of @xmath177 is a stable solution ( local free energy minimum ) describing the ergodic native phase .",
    "for example , the solution labeled @xmath249 in panel ( a ) is of this sort .",
    "the one with the smaller value of @xmath177 ( e.g. , the one labeled by @xmath250 in panel ( a ) ) is unstable .",
    "it describes a free energy maximum between the minima at the random - globule and ergodic native states .",
    "we will call such states `` unstable stationary '' ( abbreviated us ) .",
    "( we have not done a static calculation to show this , but the situation here is analogous to that in an ordinary ferromagnet below the curie temperature .",
    "there , one has three solutions of the mean field equations , one with positive , one with negative , and one with zero magnetization .",
    "the middle one , with zero magnetization , is unstable ) .",
    "the us state has a lower overlap with the native conformation than the ergodic - native solution does , because it has a smaller value of @xmath177 .",
    "as @xmath127 is increased from below through @xmath246 , the native - state and us - state solutions appear together and separate . for the temperatures of panels ( a)-(c ) , they both exist for all @xmath251 .",
    "panel ( d ) ( at the lowest of the temperatures ) shows a more complex behavior where double - minimum structure appears .",
    "we have found numerically that this happens below @xmath252 .",
    "here the behavior around @xmath246 is just as in the other cases , but we note that at this temperature @xmath242 has a second local minima at a smaller value of @xmath177 . thus there is a range @xmath253 for which there are four solutions .",
    "the rightmost one is stable and describes the ergodic - native phase , as before .",
    "moving from right to left , the solutions alternate between stability and instability .",
    "thus the second solution from the left represents a locally stable conformation .",
    "it is also correlated with the native state , since @xmath177 is finite ( though we always find @xmath254 in 3 dimensions ) . the remaining two solutions ( with @xmath255 )",
    "represent us states ( local free energy maxima ) between it and the random - globule phase in one direction and the ergodic - native phase in the other .",
    "plotting @xmath246 against @xmath22 , we obtain the stability boundary indicated by the thick solid curve in fig .  3 .",
    "within our present assumption of ergodicity , everywhere to the right of this line the ergodic - native phase is dynamically stable .",
    "one can invert the relation @xmath247 , obtaining a transition temperature @xmath256 , the maximum temperature for which the ergodic native phase is dynamically stable .",
    "it is separated from the ( also stable ) random - globule phase by a barrier , the top of which is described by the unstable solution .    in fig .",
    "3 we also indicate the region in the @xmath243 plane where the second locally - stable solution is found .",
    "this region has the form of a kind of sliver extending out toward large @xmath127 at low temperatures .",
    "so far we have not examined the stability of these solutions against glassiness . as indicated above , we do this with the help of fig .  1 :",
    "stable solutions can not lie in the range @xmath257 . in fig .  2 ,",
    "these limits are marked on the @xmath177 axes .",
    "we thus see , for example , in panel ( c ) , that the native - state solutions found for the range of @xmath127 corresponding to values of @xmath177 between @xmath258 and @xmath259 are not acceptable : they violate the at stability condition ( [ eq : atinequality ] ) .    similarly , in panel",
    "( b ) the us solutions found for a range of @xmath127 values can also be seen to lie in the forbidden region . and",
    "the intermediate locally - stable states that we identified in panel ( d ) always lie in a glassy region .    in fig .",
    "3 we also plot the at line ( [ msc ] ) in the @xmath243 plane , indicating the regions where the various kinds of ergodic solutions are forbidden . for the native - phase solutions ,",
    "the forbidden region is a strip mostly at low values of @xmath22 ( diagonally cross - hatched region between thick and at line ) .",
    "however , it `` wraps around '' at the leftmost part of the region where those solutions are found .",
    "the forbidden region for the us solutions occupies most of the region where these solutions occur below @xmath260 , the maximum temperature for a glass transition shown in fig .  1 , including the entire portion of it below @xmath2 , the glass instability temperature of the random - globule state .",
    "the structure in a tiny region near the minimum value of @xmath127 for which ergodic - native solution are found is a bit complicated and can not be seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "therefore , the lower panel shows an enlargement of this region .    in summary , we have found four kinds of ergodic solutions .",
    "one essentially describes a random globule state .",
    "it is locally stable ( in the limit of a large globule ) at all @xmath22 and @xmath127 against condensation into a native - like state , but unstable against glass formation everywhere below a transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the second kind of solution describes a phase which is highly correlated with the native state conformation , and it is stable in most of the region where the solution exists .",
    "the third kind of solution describes a locally stable state , correlated with the native state but more weakly so than the ergodic native phase just described .",
    "it is never stable against glass formation .",
    "finally , there are unstable solutions , found whenever the ergodic - native solutions exist .",
    "they describe us states , free energy maxima between pairs of the previously - described solutions . however , in a large part of the region where these solutions are found ( roughly , everywhere below @xmath261 ) they violate the at stability condition and so are not physically relevant .    outside the regions where these ergodic solutions are allowed , we have to look for glassy solutions .",

    "we must follow the glassy curve instead of the ergodic one .",
    "we interpret this glassy solution in the following way : the free energy landscape near the us maximum becomes rough in this range of values of @xmath127 ( at this temperature ) , the same way the free energy landscape near the minimum corresponding to a thermodynamic phase becomes rough in a glassy state .",

    ". we can follow this curve down to its minimum @xmath127 , beyond which no phases correlated with the native phase exist .",
    "but , of course , following it back up toward large @xmath127 on the unstable branch , we can identify the glassy us state between the phase correlated with the native state and the one uncorrelated with it .",

    "the properties of the system in this part of the phase diagram are the same as in the completely random heteropolymer model of paper i ; the bias of the interactions toward a native state does not have any effect until a ( temperature - dependent ) threshold @xmath306 is reached .",
    "this threshold is marked on the diagram by the lines separating region i from regions iii and v and region ii from region vi .    to help thinking about these phases",
    ", we offer the schematic free energy - surface pictures of fig .",
    "they show how we imagine the free energy varies as a function of the native - state overlap coordinate @xmath141 .",
    "6a depicts this cross - section through the free - energy surface in region i , where there is a single smooth minimum around @xmath197 , representing the random - globule phase .",
    "6b shows what happens in region ii , where this phase is replaced by the frozen - globule phase .",
    "we represent this by drawing the free energy surface with many local minima .",
    "6c shows what happens in the middle of region iii , where there are two ( smooth ) minima , the new one corresponding to the ergodic native phase .",
    "( it will lie above or below that at @xmath197 according to whether we are above or below a first - order transition that we expect to occur at a temperature @xmath307 , see below . ) in fig .",
    "6d we depict the situation in region iv , where both the @xmath308 region and the region around the maximum become rough . fig .",
    "6e represents region v , with the native valley and the maximum rough , but the region near @xmath197 still smooth . in fig .",
    "6f ( region vi ) , that , too , becomes rough .",
    "an important feature is the fact that the random - globule and frozen - globule phases remain ( dynamically ) stable in their respective temperature ranges for all @xmath127 .",
    "thus the horizontal line separating region i from region ii continues across the diagram , separating region v from region vi and region ii from region iv .    in each of regions",
    "ii , iv , v and vi ( fig .  6 ,",
    "panels ( b ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) ) there are two stable states .",
    "thus , regions i and iii are separated by the line @xmath256 , below or to the right of which , in addition to the random - globule state , an ergodic native state exists and is stable . in region",
    "iv , the frozen - globule and this ergodic native state are both stable . in region",
    "v , the random globule state and a glassy native state are stable , while in region vi the stable states are the frozen globule and the glassy native phase .",
    "the diagram shows some interesting fine structure in the neighborhood of the region where regions i , iii , and v meet ( second panel , point a ) . in particular , below point",
    "a , the boundary between regions iii and v ( i.e. , between the ergodic - native and glassy - native state ) is an at line .",
    "it comes about as can be seen in the last panel of fig .  4 , where , following the ergodic phase down from high @xmath127 and @xmath177 , we reach @xmath259 and thereafter have to switch to the glassy solution .",
    "on the other hand , the boundary @xmath256 above point b is reached as in the first panel of fig .  4",
    ": one can come all the way down to the minimum value of @xmath127 for the ergodic solution before reaching @xmath259 .",
    "the full line continuing upwards and to the right of point b is an at line which goes over into an @xmath309 line at its maximum , @xmath260 .",
    "below this line us solutions become glassy .    between points",
    "a and b , the boundary is marked by reaching @xmath259 in the way shown in the second panel of fig .  4",
    ": there is no stable ergodic native solution to the left of this line , since , upon lowering @xmath127 below @xmath246 in panel ( b ) , the solution with @xmath310 is lost .",
    "thus in this region the line ab is an at line for both the native phase and the us solutions .",
    "the dashed line marks the boundary found if one ignores the at line ( i.e. , it is a portion of the boundary found using the ergodic ansatz and shown in fig .",
    "3 ) .    everywhere below the at line ( both the portion ab and its extension upward to the right )",
    "is the region where the us solutions are glassy , as shown in the last panel of fig .",
    "5 . at a given @xmath127",
    ", these features all have an onset at a temperature between @xmath2 and @xmath260 . as can be seen in fig .  1",
    ", this is a very small temperature range .",
    "this is also the reason why there is fine structure , as shown in both the second and the third panels of fig .",
    "5 , in such a small temperature range in the phase diagrams .",
    "as remarked above , we have not done an equilibrium calculation , but we expect that the first - order transition temperature @xmath311 where the free energies of the random - globule and ergodic - native phases are equal will also rise with @xmath127 . for large @xmath127 , we expect @xmath312 , like @xmath4 , to be proportional to @xmath127 ( but @xmath313 , of course ) .",
    "thus , at fairly large @xmath127 , we expect the following sequence of stable states as we lower @xmath22 from a high value .",
    "initially , only the random - globule state is stable .",
    "then , below @xmath4 , the ergodic native state is also stable , and below @xmath312 it becomes the lowest - free energy state .",
    "going further down in @xmath22 , we cross the boundary ( last panel in fig .",
    "5 ) where the us state between the ergodic native and random - globule states becomes glassy ( i.e. , acquires a rough local free energy landscape ) . very soon thereafter",
    ", we cross @xmath2 , where the random - globule state undergoes glassy freezing . continuing",
    ", we reach a temperature where the ergodic native state undergoes glassy freezing .",
    "finally , we reach the stability limit of this glassy - native phase , leaving the system with nowhere to go but the frozen - globule state .    what lessons are there in these findings for protein folding ?",
    "we start from the assumption that the initial state in the folding process is uncorrelated with the native state ( i.e. , in fig .",
    "6 we start in a local minimum at @xmath314 ) .",
    "folding requires the system to find its way to the ( ergodic ) native state .",
    "one feature that is evident is that such a path in configuration space always requires an uphill free - energy step .",
    "this is because either the random - globule or frozen - globule phases is always locally stable .",
    "if we stick to our mean - field dynamical picture , where barriers are infinite , folding is , strictly speaking , impossible . in dynamical terms",
    "the `` infinite '' barriers translate into the fact that the equations which govern the motion of order parameters , @xmath141 included , have basins of attraction corresponding to the plots shown in fig .",
    "for example , starting from @xmath141 somewhere close to @xmath273 and given a free energy profile like that in fig .",
    "6c , dynamical equations will never carry @xmath141 to the large value describing the native state . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath141 will approach @xmath273 as time goes on .",
    "but , if we relax this assumption and imagine finite barriers ( associated with local nucleation of a native phase@xcite ) , we may ask ( informally ) when activated motion over the barrier to nucleation is least hindered .",
    "we argue that the free energy landscape features present globally in our mean - field picture will also be relevant locally : when our calculation here finds a glassy us state , we expect that free energy surface near the true transition state will also be rough .",
    "thus , from the preceding description of the phases and the transition states between them , we can see that folding should be easiest for large @xmath127 in a window between @xmath311 and the upper boundary of the region where the us states become glassy ( and passage across the transition region is kinetically impeded by the tortuous nature of the local free energy landscape ) .",
    "the latter boundary lies , in turn , just barely above @xmath2 , where the landscape in the ( large ) portion of the configuration space uncorrelated with the native state also becomes rough , further impeding escape from it . at still lower temperatures , things become even worse , first with the onset of glassiness in the native - like region of configuration space itself and finally with the disappearance of native - like solutions . but",
    "these features probably have minor consequences , since folding will already have been so strongly impeded by the effects ( with onset near @xmath2 ) that tend to confine it in a region of configuration space uncorrelated with the native state .",
    "we have introduced what we might call a generic model for a protein , based on what seems to us to be the simplest way to incorporate a tendency to form a native state in an otherwise random heteropolymer model . to make it possible to calculate typical properties",
    ", we follow previous authors @xcite and do not specify a particular native state , but rather an ensemble of them , constrained only by chain - entropic constraints and confinement to the appropriate volume .",
    "this ensemble is characterized by the selection temperature @xmath0 .",
    "our model differs from previous ones in that they are based on random - sequence heteropolymers , while we start from a model @xcite in which each monomer - monomer interaction is an independent random variable .    while it might be argued that random - sequence models are more relevant to proteins , they approach the model we consider here in the limit where the number of monomer types becomes large .",
    "thus , what we find out about our model may be relevant to proteins ( with 20 different amino acids ) .",
    "of course , it is also important to study what happens away from the large - monomer - type limit ; our analysis here can help in solving that more difficult problem .",
    "furthermore , naively , one might assume that by adjusting @xmath6 parameters one could imprint a native state more strongly than for models with only @xmath5 parameters .",
    "our model shows that this is not necessarily true .",
    "parts of the phase diagram are glassy , even for very low selection temperature @xmath0 , when the native state should be strongly imprinted into the model .    instead of the quadratic confinement term @xmath315 one could add three - body terms , which are commonly used to fix the globule density .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the analysis presented here to such models .",
    "also , in our treatment , translational invariance within the globule is put in by hand .",
    "keeping three - body terms would lead to automatic translational invariance .",
    "we have seen that if translational averaging is omitted ( see paper i ) then the equations become coupled in the @xmath136 variable and are thus a lot harder to solve .    within out model ,",
    "we have made just two approximations : the gaussian variational ansatz of section vi , and the assumption of 1-step ergodicity breaking ( analogous to 1-step replica symmetry breaking in the replica approach ) .",
    "otherwise the solution is complete and exact to the accuracy we were able to achieve numerically .",
    "our most important result is the existence of the various different phases at large @xmath316 , where the interactions that favor a native state are strong . while it is natural to anticipate that the native - like configurations will be thermally disrupted above a temperature of order @xmath317 , it is not so obvious that at low temperatures there will be other impediments to efficient folding .",
    "we identify two of these :    \\(1 ) the frozen - globule state , which is uncorrelated with the native state , always exists below @xmath2 , no matter how big @xmath127 is .",
    "this means that in a large part of configuration space , the system may be trapped in a rough energy landscape and never ( in mft ) get to the native - state region where it can fold rapidly .",
    "furthermore , in almost the same temperature , range , we expect that the energy landscape is also rough around the transition region on the way to the correctly - folded state , further impeding the folding process .",
    "thus , while lower temperature favors well - folded over random - globule - like configurations energetically , the rough energy landscape of the glassy phase will hinder correct folding .",
    "our conclusion here is consistent with that of goldstein _",
    "et al._@xcite , who found ( albeit in a different kind of model ) that a large @xmath318 ( or @xmath319 ) ratio favors folding .",
    "\\(2 ) at even lower temperatures , the native state itself is unstable against a glass transition where it splits into a large number of substates . transitions between these substates are blocked by high barriers ( infinite , in mft ) .",
    "a phase of this kind was found earlier by bryngelson and wolynes in a phenomenological model@xcite . it is tempting to associate the substates with the glassy conformations observed at temperatures below  200 k in myoglobin @xcite .",
    "of course , mft is an approximation .",
    "the escape from the tortuous part of the energy landscape to the smooth region will not take forever , nor will transitions between low-@xmath22 substates .",
    "nevertheless , mft does indicate when we can expect relaxational dynamics , including folding , to be slow or fast , as well as give us some insight into the physics behind these differences .",
    "our analysis here is a purely dynamical one .",
    "we do not compute equilibrium partition functions .",
    "a complete analysis would include such calculations , but we defer them to future work .",
    "nevertheless , the purely dynamical analysis can reveal important properties of the system that can not be seen in an equilibrium analysis .",
    "for example , it has been know for a long time that for a large class of models  namely , those which have a glass transition where @xmath182  the dynamic and static glass transition temperatures are different @xcite .",
    "this is expected to be the case for the transition at @xmath2 in our model : the equilibrium glass transition temperature is lower than the dynamical one .",
    "thus , in a temperature range just below the dynamical @xmath2 , the equilibrium analysis does not reveal the slow dynamics ( accompanied by aging ) that we are able to identify and analyze here .",
    "in other glassy models for which it has been possible to do a more complete analysis @xcite , the static and dynamic transitions coincide when they occur as a result of an almeida - thouless instability ( the marginal stability condition , eqn  [ msc ] ) @xcite .",
    "this is the case here at the phase boundary where the native - like state becomes glassy .",
    "gillin and sherrington @xcite and gillin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have been able to analyze both the statics and the dynamics of several classes of mean - field spin glass models with a competition between glassy and ferromagnetic states ( see also ref .  @xcite for a special case ) .",
    "some features of the phase diagram of our model that we have been able to discover so far are also seen in their models .",
    "gillin _ et al .",
    "_ also studied full ( as well as 1-step ) replica symmetry breaking solutions , which we have not . in some of their models ,",
    "the counterpart of our glassy native phase undergoes full rsb at low temperatures , and the counterpart of our ii - vi boundary becomes vertical .",
    "it is possible in our model as well that , in particular regions of the phase diagram , our 1-step solutions are not stable and full rsb is necessary .",
    "more generally , it will be an interesting problem to try to explore what kinds and degrees of universality there are in the phase structures of various systems where the glassiness induced by disorder competes with some kind of order analogous to the native state in our problem or the ferromagnetic state in theirs .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank silvio franz for discussions leading to our formulation of this problem .",
    "here we derive eq .",
    "( [ g10a ] ) . inserting eq .",
