    "it follows that the ornstein s class of transformations may possibly contain a candidate for banach s well - known problem whether there exists a dynamical system @xmath1 with simple lebesgue spectrum .",
    "but , in 1993 , j. bourgain in @xcite proved that almost surely ornstein s transformations have singular spectrum .",
    "subsequently , using the same method , i. klemes @xcite and i. klemes & k. reinhold @xcite obtain that mixing staircase transformations of adams @xcite and adams & friedman @xcite have singular spectrum .",
    "they conjecture that all rank one transformations have singular spectrum .    here",
    "we shall exhibit a new class of rank one transformations with singular spectrum .",
    "our assumption include some new class of ornstein transformations and a class of creutz - silva rank one transformations @xcite .",
    "our proof is based on techniques introduced by j. bourgain @xcite in the context of rank one transformations and developed by klemes @xcite , klemes - rienhold @xcite , dooley - eigen @xcite , together with some ideas from the proof of the central limit theorem for trignometric sums .",
    "the fundamental key , as noted by klemes @xcite , is the estimation of the @xmath2-norm of a certain trigonometric polynomial @xmath3 .",
    "we shall use the method of central limit theorem for trignometric sums to produce an estimate of this @xmath2-norm .",
    "using the cutting and stacking method described in [ fr1 ] , [ fr2 ] , one can construct inductively a family of measure preserving transformations , called rank one transformations , as follows 0.1 cm let @xmath4 be the unit interval equipped with the lebesgue measure . at stage one",
    "we divide @xmath4 into @xmath5 equal parts , add spacers and form a stack of height @xmath6 in the usual fashion . at the @xmath7 stage",
    "we divide the stack obtained at the @xmath8 stage into @xmath9 equal columns , add spacers and obtain a new stack of height @xmath10 .",
    "if during the @xmath7 stage of our construction the number of spacers put above the @xmath11 column of the @xmath8 stack is @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , then we have    @xmath15 3 cm 3.5 cm 3.0 cm proceeding in this way we get a rank one transformation @xmath16 on a certain measure space @xmath17 which may be finite or @xmath18finite depending on the number of spacers added .",
    "+ the construction of a rank one transformation thus needs two parameters , @xmath19 ( parameter of cutting and stacking ) , and @xmath20 ( parameter of spacers ) .",
    "put    @xmath21    in @xcite and @xcite it is proved that the spectral type of this transformation is given ( upto possibly some discrete measure ) by    @xmath22    where @xmath23 @xmath24 denotes the normalized lebesgue measure on the circle group @xmath25 and @xmath26 denotes weak*limit in the space of bounded borel measures on @xmath27 .",
