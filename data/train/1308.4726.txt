    "methane ( ch@xmath0 ) is the most fundamental alkane molecule and is second only to co@xmath8 in causing climate change @xcite .",
    "the presence of ch@xmath0 in the earth s atmosphere is a consequence of both anthropogenic ( e.g. , landfills , rice cultivation , waste water treatment ) and natural sources ( e.g. , methanogens , wetlands , wildfires ) .",
    "ch@xmath0 can also be found throughout the solar system @xcite including the atmospheres of jupiter , saturn , uranus , neptune and tentatively in the martian atmosphere @xcite .",
    "titan , the largest moon of saturn , has a dense atmosphere which is mostly made up of nitrogen but contains a relatively large proportion of ch@xmath0 ( approximately 1.4% in the stratosphere ; niemann et al .",
    "the concentration of ch@xmath0 is higher near the surface and it is believed a methane cycle exists which leads to the formation of liquid ch@xmath0 lakes @xcite .",
    "interestingly , ch@xmath0 has also been observed in the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of cool substellar objects such as brown dwarfs @xcite and more recently in exoplanet atmospheres @xcite .",
    "cool stars and brown dwarfs are classified according to the molecular features in the observed sed @xcite .",
    "the cooler the object , the more molecular signatures can be identified in the sed @xcite .",
    "l dwarfs display near - infrared electronic transitions of metal hydrides such as feh @xcite and weaker tio and vo bands @xcite which are more commonly associated with m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "t dwarfs contain significant absorption due to h@xmath8o and ch@xmath0 @xcite and have been referred to as ` methane dwarfs ' @xcite because methane is the characteristic absorber .",
    "the newest category of brown dwarf ( y class ) has recently been observed @xcite and displays characteristic nh@xmath9 absorptions along with additional ch@xmath0 absorption .",
    "given these band assignments , the seds of brown dwarfs are complex and still contain numerous unassigned features .",
    "the study of exoplanets is relatively new , as it was not until the mid-1990s that the first exoplanet was discovered @xcite . in recent years , ` hot - jupiters ' are being discovered at an increasing rate and @xcite were able to identify a further 100 using nasa s _ wide - field infrared survey explorer_. it is now possible to probe the atmospheres of exoplanets @xcite by utilizing the natural transit as the planet passes in front of its parent star .",
    "the resulting flux undergoes a characteristic ` dip ' at specific wavelengths during the planetary transit @xcite and from the extremely small variations in the wavelength dependence of the dips it is possible to determine which molecules are present . by utilizing the transit method , h@xmath8o @xcite , ch@xmath0 @xcite , co @xcite and co@xmath8 @xcite have already been identified .",
    "currently this method has only been successful for large hot - jupiters , but nasa s _ kepler _ mission is discovering ever smaller planets which more closely resemble earth , such as _ kepler-22b _ @xcite .",
    "exoplanets are now thought to be the rule , rather than the exception , throughout the milky way @xcite and the ultimate exoplanet goal is to detect the distinctive signatures of extra terrestrial life through observation of the atmospheres of these distant planets .",

    "ch@xmath0 is a tetrahedral molecule ( t@xmath17 symmetry ) and is a classic example of a spherical top .",
    "there are @xmath18 infrared modes with four stretches and five bends .",
    "the four c  h stretches correspond to a symmetric @xmath19 stretch ( @xmath10 at 2916.481 @xmath2 ) and a triply degenerate @xmath20 antisymmetric stretch ( @xmath14 at 3019.493 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the five bends correspond to a doubly degenerate @xmath21 bending mode ( @xmath12 at 1533.333 @xmath2 ) and a triply degenerate @xmath20 bending mode ( @xmath16 at 1310.761 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic constants of ch@xmath0 are summarised in table  [ tab : modes ] @xcite and only the @xmath14 and @xmath16 fundamental modes are nominally infrared active ; however , it is possible for other modes to gain intensity through strong interactions within the polyad structure .",
    "the interesting polyad structure of the infrared spectrum of ch@xmath0 arises because the bending frequencies are approximately equal ( @xmath22 ) , the stretching frequencies are also approximately equal ( @xmath23 ) and approximately twice the bending frequencies @xcite .",
    "for example , the pentad region near 3 @xmath3 m has 5 vibrational bands since @xmath24 .",
    "ch@xmath0 has also frequently been the target of high quality theoretical calculations based on the solution of the vibration - rotation schrdinger equation @xcite using _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of vibration - rotational calculations are typically far from experiment ; however , recent calculations of nominally forbidden pure rotational lines @xcite are able to approach experimental accuracy .",

    "extensive work has been carried out in grenoble including the preparation of a cold ch@xmath0 line list @xcite which has been successfully applied to the atmosphere of titan @xcite .",
    "recently focus has shifted to the generation of hot line lists for use in brown dwarfs and exoplanet models , either from _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite or from experiment @xcite .",
    "radiative transfer models are typically used to identify molecules in the atmospheres of exoplanets @xcite .",
    "adaptations for hot - jupiter atmospheres include known strongly absorbing molecules ( i.e. h@xmath8o and ch@xmath0 ) and one of the options for ch@xmath0 has been the hitran 2008 database @xcite combined with experimental data obtained by @xcite .",
    "hitran covers a broad spectral range but is intended for room temperature applications whereas the @xcite data are only recorded at three higher temperatures ( 800 , 1000 and 1273 k ) .",
    "this limits the accuracy of the modeled seds and leads to errors in deriving effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "we hope to address this issue by providing a series of high - resolution , hot ch@xmath0 line lists at temperatures relevant to exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres with the inclusion of empirical lower state energies where possible .",
    "this work will cover the dyad ( @xmath12 , @xmath16 ) , pentad ( @xmath10 , @xmath14 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) and octad ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) regions of the infrared including numerous hot bands .",

    "our data sets , and molecular opacities derived from them , can be used directly in exoplanet and brown dwarf models .",
    "high - resolution laboratory emission spectra of hot ch@xmath0 were recorded in four separate parts in order to maximise the signal - to - noise for each spectral region .",
    "the four spectral regions are shown in figure  [ fig : allspectra ] for 1000@xmath1c .",
    "a similar setup was used in our previous work on nh@xmath9 @xcite and only key experimental features will be summarized here .        the experiment coupled a fourier transform infrared ( ft - ir ) spectrometer with a temperature controllable tube furnace capable of maintaining stable temperatures up to 1400@xmath1c with an accuracy @xmath36c .",
    "the tube furnace surrounds the central portion of an alumina ( al@xmath8o@xmath9 ) tube which is sealed at both ends by infrared windows .",
    "ch@xmath0 gas is allowed to flow through the alumina tube at a stable pressure in order to avoid the build up of impurities .",
    "the infrared emission from the alumina tube was focussed onto the aperture of the ft - ir spectrometer using a lens .",
    "the small region between the spectrometer and tube furnace was purged with dry air in order to minimize h@xmath8o absorption lines in the recorded spectra .",

    "we have produced ch@xmath0 line lists which can be used at temperatures from 300@xmath1c to 1400@xmath1c .",
    "the calibration of the wavenumber scale for each spectrum was done by making wavenumber comparisons of 20 lines to the hitran database and this gives an overall accuracy of better than 0.005 @xmath2 .",
    "the wavenumber calibration is straightforward but intensity calibration is more difficult .",
    "line intensities are notoriously hard to calibrate and our calibration was made by comparing as many lines as possible to the hitran database .",
    "our overall line intensity accuracy is estimated to be approximately a factor of two .",
    "intensity matches for lower wavenumbers ( regions a and b ) were good and allowed a consistent calibration function to be determined .",
    "each region overlapped the neighbouring region with enough emission lines to place all regions on the same scale .",
    "for region d the intensity matches with hitran were effectively absent so a calibration factor could not be determined from this region alone .",
    "since all regions are on the same scale , the calibration function was extrapolated into region d. in order to validate our extrapolation we were able to compare our 1000@xmath1c spectrum with the equivalent 1273 k spectrum from @xcite . the matches ( @xmath400.0025 @xmath2 ) can be seen in figure  [ fig : nassar ] and show a clear intensity correlation to within a factor of two which gives confidence in the calibration applied .",
    "the slope is present because the @xcite calibrations were performed using a single factor whereas the calibration used here is a parabolic function .",
    "it is difficult to estimate an error for the empirical @xmath4 values presented here because self absorption causes inaccurate intensities resulting in inaccurate empirical @xmath4 values .",
    "this means comparisons can only be made between emission lines removed from the line lists and lines inserted from the hitran database .",
    "comparison of the @xmath4 values of the five lines in figure  [ fig : slope ] can give a false impression of the accuracy , as in table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "a better estimate can be obtained by plotting the ratio of @xmath4 from hitran compared to the empirical @xmath4 values of the removed lines ( figure  [ fig : elowerrors ] at 1000@xmath1c ) .",
    "it clearly shows that the most common value of the hitran @xmath4 /empirical @xmath4 ratio is approximately one and that the majority of empirical @xmath4 values are accurate to within 20 % .",
    "it can be seen that the most accurate lines ( with a quality factor of ` 1 ' ) also display the smallest spread as opposed to the least accurate lines ( quality factor of ` 3 ' ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : elowerrors ] also shows why it was necessary to remove these lines because there is a tendency towards low ratios ( @xmath73 ) due to inaccurate line intensities caused by self absorption .    at high temperatures , thermal decomposition of methane",
    "is expected @xcite and lower intensities are indeed observed for our high temperature spectra .",
    "the highest temperature spectra recorded in region d ( 1200@xmath1c and 1300@xmath1c ) were contaminated by the absorption and emission of the products of thermal decomposition , namely c@xmath8h@xmath8 and c@xmath8h@xmath0 .",
    "attempts have been made to remove these species by using recent line lists @xcite ; however , the emission features could not be completely removed .",
    "as this is the case , the hot ch@xmath0 emission lines could not be distinguished from the products of thermal decomposition and the 1200@xmath1c and 1300@xmath1c files of region d have been excluded from our analysis .",
    "empirical @xmath4 values have been determined previously using a similar method by our group for the hot line lists of nh@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it has also been used in the submillimeter regime @xcite and on ` cold ' ch@xmath0 in the infrared @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath4 values of an astrophysical ` weed ' ( ethyl cyanide ) using numerous cool ( -@xmath74  @xmath75c ) spectra .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have used a similar approach to study ch@xmath0 based on a small number of room temperature and cold ( @xmath6180 k ) spectra .",
    "the method presented here uses a dozen ` hot ' ( 300  1400@xmath1c ) spectra which were recorded under conditions that are similar to those found in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and hot - jupiters .",
    "the use of a large number of spectra improves the accuracy of the @xmath4 values .",
    "however a single spectrum takes us many hours to record ( including heating and cooling of the system ) so it is impractical to record many additional spectra . nevertheless",
    ", combining both hot and cold ch@xmath0 line lists would help to complete the knowledge of ch@xmath0 in the infrared .",
    "our method produces a relatively small number of lines with high line position accuracy .",
    "an alternative approach is to use _ ab initio _ calculations which provide significantly more lines but the line positions have much lower accuracy .",
    "the two methods are complementary and they can be combined to produce a merged line list . @xcite have used the _ ab initio _ approach and were able to assign quantum numbers to some of our new nh@xmath9 data ; similar calculations are currently underway for ch@xmath0 .",
    "+ the ch@xmath0 line lists are available as electronic supplements via the website of the astrophysical journal ( 2013 , _ apj _ , 774 , 89 , doi:10.1088/0004 - 637x/774/1/89 ) and spectra can also be provided upon request .",
    "the line lists should be used at the specified temperature ; if a temperature is needed between those provided , we recommend scaling the lines using equation  [ eqn : ratios ]",
    ". only line lists from this erratum should be used .",
    "experimental line lists of hot ch@xmath0 have been provided which contain calibrated wavenumbers ( in @xmath2 ) , calibrated intensities ( in cm molecule@xmath7 ) and empirical lower state energies ( in @xmath2 ) .",
    "the line lists were based on 12 emission spectra recorded at 300  1400@xmath1c in 100@xmath1c intervals using a ft - ir spectrometer and cover the 960  5000 @xmath2 wavenumber range .",
