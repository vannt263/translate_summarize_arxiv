    "entanglement in quantum spin chains has received considerable attention . for gapless quantum spin chains detailed predictions  @xcite of many aspects of the entanglement",
    "have been obtained from conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "for these ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional models a precise understanding of the entanglement has proven invaluable for the understanding of numerical techniques such as as the density - matrix renormalization group  @xcite ( dmrg ) as well as for the development of new techniques .",
    "the contribution to the entanglement arising from impurities has also attracted considerable interest  @xcite . here",
    "the term impurities is used in the general sense and includes the effects of boundary magnetic fields  @xcite , boundaries  @xcite , qubits interacting with a decohering environment  @xcite as well as kondo - like impurities  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the impurity can lead to different conformally invariant boundary conditions which can dramatically alter the entanglement . for a review see reference  @xcite .",
    "quantum spin models have been used for studies of qubit teleportation and quantum state transfer  @xcite , where the change in entanglement arising from the impurities plays a crucial role .    usually the entanglement is defined in terms of the von neumann entanglement - entropy of a sub - system @xmath9 of size @xmath10 and reduced density - matrix @xmath11 defined by  @xcite , @xmath12\\ ,    \\label{eq : vns}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 stands for the total system size .",
    "it is known @xcite that the entanglement - entropy of heisenberg - spin - chains with open boundary conditions have a uniform as well as an alternating part : @xmath14 where the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for uniform and alternating respectively .    .",
    "the chain is separated into part @xmath9 ( grey box ) , which includes the impurity and has the length @xmath10 , and the rest of the chain .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    based on this observation , the impurity entanglement - entropy @xmath17 was introduced to quantify the contribution an impurity has to the entanglement of a spin chain  @xcite . to model an impurity ,",
    "the interactions on one site are scaled by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "the impurity entanglement - entropy is given by the difference of the uniform part of the entanglement - entropies of the chain with the impurity present and the chain without the impurity .",
    "the sub - system @xmath9 in the definition of the entanglement - entropy in equation  [ eq : vns ] is chosen to contain the first @xmath10 sites of the chain and thus contains the impurity site , too ( see figure  [ fig : exentmea ] ) . upon removing the impurity site ,",
    "@xmath9 as well as the whole chain are one element shorter . the uniform entanglement - entropy in a system where the impurity is absent is thus given by @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to the following definition of @xmath2 : @xmath19 this definition is similar in spirit to experimental procedures for extracting impurity contributions to , for instance , susceptibilities .",
    "it is also possible to consider the alternating part of the impurity entanglement but we shall not do that here .",
    "however , it was later pointed out  @xcite that a more consistent definition of the impurity contribution to the entanglement can be obtained from the negativity  @xcite .",
    "the negativity between a sub - system @xmath9 and the rest of the system is defined by @xmath20 where the @xmath21 are the eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the density - matrix with respect to either @xmath9 or the rest of the system .",
    "in contrast to the entanglement - entropy it can also be used to quantify the entanglement if the system is _ not _ in a pure state .",
    "this makes it possible to use the negativity to directly quantify the entanglement of the impurity - spin and another part of the system .",
    "it is an important question to what extent these two quantities yield the same information about the impurity entanglement . in this paper",
    "we compare these two measures and show that they agree for many universal features but are fundamentally different with @xmath22 being the more general measure of the impurity entanglement .",
    "entanglement and in particular impurity entanglement in gapped quantum spin chains has received comparatively little attention . in part",
    "this is due to the fact that for non - critical spin chains with a finite correlation length @xmath23 one expects  @xcite for a partition into 2 semi - infinite chains : @xmath24 for instance , for the @xmath25 affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) chain  @xcite where the entanglement can be calculated analytically  @xcite it is known that @xmath26 approaches a constant for large @xmath27 in an exponential manner  @xcite on a length scale equal to the bulk correlation length @xmath28 . at the majumdar - ghosh - point ( mg - point ) @xcite of the @xmath29 spin chain , where @xmath30 , one finds that @xmath26 is either 0 or @xmath31 for any @xmath27 .",
    "however , the impurity contribution to the entanglement _ can still be long - range _ in gapped spin chains . for the @xmath29 spin chain this was shown to be the case at the mg - point  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the two - fold degeneracy of the singlet ground - state , corresponding to the two different dimerization patterns , and the associated presence of solitons separating regions with different dimerization .",
    "the model we study is the slightly more general @xmath0 quantum spin chain defined as : @xmath32   \\nonumber \\\\    & + \\sum_{i=1}^{l-3}\\big[(1+(-\\delta)^i)\\vec{s}_i\\cdot\\vec{s}_{i+1 } + j_2 \\ ;    \\vec{s}_i\\cdot\\vec{s}_{i+2}\\big ]   \\nonumber \\\\    & + ( 1 + ( -\\delta)^{l-2 } ) \\vec{s}_{l-2 } \\cdot \\vec{s}_{l-1 } \\ ;   ,       \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     chain with an impurity coupled with strength @xmath7.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    where we implicitly have set the nearest - neighbour - coupling @xmath33 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath7 describes the coupling of the impurity - spin and @xmath8 is a staggering of the nearest - neighbour - coupling inducing dimerization .",
    "we focus exclusively on chains with open boundary conditions and the impurity at one end of the chain . with @xmath34",
    "this model undergoes a transition from the gapless heisenberg - phase to a dimerized state at @xmath35 @xcite . in the heisenberg - phase a correspondence to the low - energy physics of a kondo impurity",
    "can be established  @xcite .",
    "this correspondence becomes _ exact _ at @xmath36 .",
    "the mapping to the kondo - problem requires one to use open boundary conditions and we therefore do not consider periodic boundary conditions here .",
    "however , entanglement in models similar to the one considered here but with periodic boundary conditions have also been studied , see section 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .    with periodic boundary conditions and an even number of sites ,",
    "the system at the mg - point has an exactly known two - fold degenerate dimerized ground - state and a gapped spectrum @xcite .",
    "( with open boundary conditions and @xmath13 even the ground - state is unique with the same energy ) .",
    "the lowest lying excitations of the mg - chain are pairs of unbound solitons and upon introducing a finite dimerization the solitons become confined @xcite . for a chain with an odd number of sites solitons separate regions with the ground - state dimerization - pattern of the chain with an even number of sites @xcite . in the _ gapped _ phase , in the proximity of the mg - point ,",
    "it is possible to perform very precise variational calculations  @xcite for the @xmath29 model ( corresponding to @xmath37 in this study ) since appropriate states spanning the variational sub - space can be identified with relative ease , as the ground - state at the mg - point is known . within this variational framework it is possible to evaluate the entanglement  @xcite . here",
    ", we explain in detail how similar calculations can be performed for the negativity and discuss the appropriate sub - spaces used in these computations . along the so called disorder - line , where @xmath38 , one of the two degenerate ground - states of the majumdar - ghosh - chain remains the _",
    "exact _ ground - state .",
    "close to the disorder - line , one therefore expects the same variational methods to yield very precise results .    in the past",
    ", these variational calculations have been performed more or less by hand  @xcite .",
    "if the variational problem is , however , formulated as a generalized eigenvalue - problem , it is not difficult to automate the calculation , as for any two states , @xmath39 and @xmath40 with all but no , one or two sites being in dimers , @xmath41 as well as the overlaps between different @xmath42 can be computed in an automated fashion .",
    "one advantage of the automated computation of these matrix - elements is that one avoids lengthy and error - prone calculations .",
    "secondly , solving a generalized eigenvalue - problem can be done using standard libraries .",
    "this approach is not limited to the specific hamiltonian studied in this paper .",
    "it can in fact be used to perform variational calculations using dimerized states forming the subspace in which the diagonalization is carried out for _ any _ heisenberg - spin - hamiltonian .",
    "in addition to providing a more direct analytical insight into the physics , the main advantages the variational approach has over other methods such as the dmrg - technique are computational cost and simplicity .",
    "this advantage does , however , not come for free . to identify a good subspace to use for variational calculations ,",
    "one always has to rely on knowledge gained obtained by other means .",
    "this role is often played by the dmrg - technique .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections  [ sec : method ] , [ sec : spaces ] , [ sec : matele ] and [ sec : overlap ] the variational approach is discussed along with the different sub - spaces used in the calculations . section  [ sec : negativity ] describes the calculation of the negativity once the variational ground - state is known and sample results for the negativity are compared to dmrg - data . in section  [ sec : negandsimp ] the negativity and the impurity - entanglement - entropy are compared .",
    "section  [ sec : negandjk ] presents our results for the negativity and @xmath2 for general @xmath7 at the mg point . in section  [ sec : impentdeluneq0 ] we describe how the impurity entanglement is affected by the presence of a non - zero explicit dimerization , @xmath8 .",
    "for completeness we review here how the variational problem can be formulated as a generalized eigenvalue - problem .",
    "consider a set of states @xmath43 to be used for the variational calculation .",
    "we then wish to minimize @xmath44 where the trial - state @xmath42 is given by : @xmath45 the minimization is to be performed with respect to the @xmath46 . in variational calculations we make use of the fact that : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ground - state energy .",
    "one strives to find a well chosen set of @xmath39s as well as the state @xmath49 that satisfies @xmath50 this state is the variational estimate for the ground - state .",
    "let us denote the energy - eigenbasis with @xmath51 .",
    "the variational state @xmath42 can evidently be written as @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the energy of the eigenstate @xmath55 of non - zero projection onto @xmath56 that has the lowest energy . with any orthonormal basis @xmath57 of @xmath58 , the variational guess for the ground - state @xmath59",
    "can thus be found by diagonalizing @xmath60 :    * minimization problem @xmath61 finding lowest eigenvalue of @xmath62    if we do not have an orthonormal basis at our disposal , we have to do a little more work .",
    "let us suppose that the @xmath39 are linearly independent and the @xmath63 are the orthonormal basis of energy - eigenstates",
    ". for the variational ground - state given by @xmath64 and the variational estimate of the ground - state - energy @xmath54 we know from the equations  ( [ eq : vareig ] ) that @xmath65 we will now show that a vector @xmath66 is a solution to the variational problem if and only if @xmath67 with the definitions @xmath68 one can write equation  ( [ eq : geneigenval1 ] ) as @xmath69 which defines a generalized eigenvalue - problem .",
    "that equation  ( [ eq : minimize2 ] ) implies equation  ( [ eq : geneigenval1 ] ) can be seen by taking the scalar - product of both sides in equation  ( [ eq : minimize2 ] ) with @xmath39 .",
    "that equation  ( [ eq : geneigenval1 ] ) implies ( [ eq : minimize2 ] ) will now be proved .",
    "we do this by proving that for any basis ( linearly independent set of states that span the space ) @xmath43 : @xmath70 for any vectors @xmath71 , @xmath72 . with @xmath73 and @xmath74 the relation ( [ rel : linindequiv ] ) becomes the relation equation  ( [ eq : geneigenval1 ] ) @xmath75 ( [ eq : minimize2 ] ) .",
    "proof : @xmath76 we have thus proven that the minimization - problem of equation  ( [ eq : minimize1 ] ) can be replaced by the generalized eigenvalue - problem of equation  ( [ eq : geneigenval2 ] ) , if the states used to span the subspace in which the minimization takes place are linearly independent .",
    "the implementation of the variational technique as a generalized eigenvalue - problem allows us to just solve a linear algebra problem instead of solving a set of non - linear equations which is necessary if one approaches the minimization naively .",
    "the one requirement for this implementation to work is for the states that span the hilbert - space in which the minimization is done to be linearly independent .",
    "this flexibility makes it possible to use different bases according to the specific needs of the problem .",
    "here we are concerned with the two cases of even and odd length chains .",
    "1 .   chain with odd number of sites : + the simplest ensemble of variational states for a chain with an odd number of sites are the so called single soliton states  @xcite . these states can be generated by taking @xmath77 of the sites of the chain to be maximally dimerized while leaving the left over site ( the soliton ) to be in the @xmath78 state . here and",
    "in the remainder of the paper we use @xmath13 to denote the length of the chain .",
    "the number of dimers between the undimerized site and the left end of the chain can be used to label the states . in figure",
    "[ fig : trailstatesodd1 ] we show a pictorial representation of the first three states .",
    "when drawing a dimer we use an arrow to denote the order in @xmath79 . for an odd length chain with",

    "note that we here do not include states with the soliton in the @xmath81 state .",
    "+   +   + 2 .",
    "chain with even number of sites : + in studies of the entanglement of the impurity - site with the rest of a chain with an even number of sites , a suitable set of states can be defined by leaving the bulk @xmath82 sites of the chain dimerized while one of the spins is in a valence bond with the impurity .",

    "we want to stress that even though the single soliton states can be orthogonalized with relative ease  @xcite this is not generally the case and even after orthogonalization the resulting eigenvalue problem is still non - trivial for a general set of @xmath97 . whether or not it is possible to proceed with analytical calculations",
    "often depends on specific choices for the coupling constants in the hamiltonian . here",
    ", we can solve the variational problem for any values of the couplings .",
    "as can be seen in equation  ( [ eq : outside ] ) and figure  [ fig : bondac](b ) , the application of @xmath91 to a given state @xmath39 may result in a state that is not element of @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , in order to evaluate @xmath99 we need to compute the overlap of @xmath100 with all the variational states .",
    "this slows down our calculations since it is not sufficient to build a table of all the overlaps of the @xmath39 .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of how the overlaps are calculated .",
    "as is explained in @xcite the magnitude of the overlaps of valence - bond - states depends solely on the length of loops created by overlaying the two states .",
    "if one chooses @xmath10 to be the length of such a loop then the overlap is of magnitude @xmath101 . to get the sign of the overlap we , in addition to overlaying them , reverse all arrows on one of the states .",
    "then we follow the loop and count how often one has to go against the arrow .",
    "if the resulting number is odd , the sign of the overlap is negative .",
    "if the resulting number is even , the sign of the overlap is positive . because the total number of bonds in the loop is even this leads to a well defined sign of the overlap .",
    "+   +    to get the overlaps of two states one only has to follow this prescription for every loop and multiply contributions from different loops .",
    "figure  [ fig : transgraph](c ) shows the loop - structure for the states shown in figure  [ fig : transgraph](a ) and figure  [ fig : transgraph](b ) .",
    "the left loop is six bonds long and going around it one has to go against the direction of the arrow three times .",
    "the right loop is 2 bonds long and one has to go against the direction of the arrow once .",
    "the overlap is therefore given by : @xmath102 in the case of unpaired spins being part of the states the rules have to be modified slightly . if there is one unpaired spin in both states , upon overlaying the two states , there will in addition to loops be a string that goes from one unpaired spin to the other . as is the case for the loops , for the string the magnitude of the contribution to the overlap depends only on the length .",
    "one finds the contribution to be : @xmath103 .",
    "the contribution to the sign of the overlap can be determined in exactly the same way as in the case of complete loops .",
    "for the calculation of the negativity describing the entanglement between the impurity - spin and a distant part of the chain , it is necessary to separate the chain into three parts  @xcite : the impurity - spin , the part whose entanglement with the impurity - spin is to be quantified and the part that separates the two ( the parts will in the remainder of the paper also be referred to as region a , b and x respectively .",
    "the negativity is invariant under interchange of b and x. for clarification see figure  [ fig : negpl ] ) .        to calculate the negativity between the impurity - spin and a part of the chain that is separated from the impurity - spin by a different part",
    ", we have to compute the reduced density - matrix that results from tracing out the separating part of the chain .",

    "the dimerization of the state implies that every spin is maximally entangled with one of its neighbours .",
    "it follows that the impurity is only entangled with its neighbour and not with any other spin .",
    "while this can be inferred from the negativity shown in figure  [ fig : simpnegjk1](a ) which is exactly 0 for @xmath153 , this is not the case for @xmath2 which in fact becomes negative ( ! ) .",
    "the difference in the two measures arises from the subtractive procedure used to define @xmath2 where the term @xmath154 in addition to terms cancelling out @xmath155 also contains a contribution arising from the single unpaired spin which is present because @xmath77 is odd .",
    "this contribution from @xmath154 can be identified as the single particle entanglement  @xcite ( spe ) .",
    "hence , @xmath2 fails in this case to be a good measure of the impurity entanglement since @xmath154 is not a good reference state and can not be identified with @xmath156 .",
    "it would be very interesting to define a measure of the impurity entanglement based on a relative entropy but again one would need a well defined reference state with the impurity absent .    for a system with an _ odd _ number of sites the spe is the only contribution to @xmath2 at @xmath152 . here the impurity is viewed in the general sense as arising from the boundary conditions yielding the non - zero @xmath2 . however , the negativity , since it is really a tri - partite measure , is not sensitive to this and is negligible for @xmath157 as shown in figure  [ fig : simpnegjk1](b ) at the mg - point .",
    "it may be conjectured that @xmath22 and @xmath158 agree well as long as the ivb contribution dominates @xmath158 as is the case in figure  [ fig : simpnegjk0 ] .",
    "we also note that the spe vanishes at @xmath36  @xcite and we expect @xmath22 and @xmath2 to exhibit the same scaling behaviour at @xmath36 as it indeed has been demonstrated  @xcite . for @xmath159 , @xmath22 is the more faithful measure of the impurity entanglement and in the following we mainly use this measure .",
    "as we saw in the previous section , the impurity entanglement for an _ even _ length system with @xmath140 can be seen as arising from an impurity valence bond ( ivb ) . at the mg - point for @xmath140",
    "this was calculated within the variational approach in reference  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the negativity @xmath22 and the complete cross - over as @xmath7 is varied between @xmath145 and @xmath160 .",
    "variational results of @xmath22 at different @xmath7 for a system of length @xmath139 ( including the impurity site ) are shown in figure  [ fig : crossoverivb](a ) . at @xmath140",
    "the impurity entanglement is long - range , extending throughout the chain , but as @xmath7 is turned on it quickly becomes suppressed and for @xmath7 larger than @xmath161 it has all but disappeared reflecting the fact that the impurity valence bond now preferentially terminates close to the impurity site .",
    "for these non - zero values of @xmath7 the appropriate @xmath162 to use would then no longer be the wave - function of a free particle , as in equation  ( [ solwave ] ) , but instead a wave - function describing a localized state bound to the impurity site .",
    "the presence of such a localized state should be reflected in an exponentially decaying impurity entanglement away from the impurity site .",
    "for @xmath163 we have verified that the negativity @xmath22 shown in figure  [ fig : crossoverivb](a ) indeed has a tail decaying exponentially with the site index .",
    "the length scale , @xmath164 , associated with this exponential decay is therefore clearly distinct from the bulk spin - spin correlation length in the system which here is effectively zero .",
    "the sharpness of the cross - over is illustrated in figure  [ fig : crossoverivb](b ) where for a chain of @xmath165 spins the negativity with the region x containing @xmath166 spins is plotted versus @xmath7 . as can be seen , @xmath22 transitions from @xmath167 to @xmath145 very close to @xmath168 .",
    "for @xmath169 we have not been able to identify any exponentially decaying part in @xmath22 as obtained within the variational approach even for systems substantially longer than @xmath165 and it appears that a finite @xmath170 is needed to induce an exponential decay in @xmath22 .",
    "this would imply that the presence of a non - zero @xmath7 can not be modelled as a simple one - dimensional potential well , since this would always have a bound - state independent of the depth of the potential well .",
    "likely , an enlarged variational space for the calculation will change the value for @xmath171 and could possibly drive it all the way to zero .",
    "however , bayat  @xcite , using dmrg , do not find an exponential decay for @xmath172 and @xmath137 consistent with a non - zero @xmath171 . due to the complexity of the calculation of @xmath22 in larger sub - spaces we have ,",
    "however , been unable to complete such calculations .     for different @xmath7 with @xmath173 .",
    "all results are obtained at the mg - point with @xmath34 . for clarity",
    "only a fraction of all data points is shown.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in a similar manner we can study the single particle entanglement ( spe ) for general @xmath7 within the variational approach .",
    "our results are shown in figure  [ fig : crossoverspe ] .",
    "the single particle entanglement arises from the presence of a single unpaired spin for odd @xmath13 which is always present in the ground - state for odd @xmath13 .",
    "the unpaired spin moves freely throughout the system when @xmath152 but as @xmath7 is decreased away from 1 towards zero it rapidly becomes localized on the impurity site thereby quenching the impurity entanglement . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : crossoverspe ] the impurity entanglement rapidly transitions around @xmath174 .",
    "while the variational approach agrees closely with dmrg data away from this transition region , some quantitative differences appear in this region due to the limitation of the hilbert space used in the variational approach .",
    "the variational and dmrg results are however qualitatively the same and we have for clarity not included dmrg results in figure  [ fig : crossoverspe ] .",
    "we have verified that for @xmath175 the data for @xmath2 shown in figure  [ fig : crossoverspe ] develop an exponentially decaying part with an associated length scale , @xmath164 , different from the bulk spin - spin correlation length . also here",
    ", it appears that @xmath164 diverges before @xmath7 reaches 1 but this effect could possibly be due to finite - size effects in the dmrg calculations or limitations in the sub - space used in the variational calculations .",
    "the variational approach that we employ here is straight forward to use for any @xmath177 and @xmath7 and we now discuss our results for the impurity entanglement for non - zero explicit dimerization @xmath176 . as we stressed in the introduction the impurity entanglement can be long - range in these systems due to the near degeneracy of the two singlet ground - states of the chain with periodic boundary conditions . with a non - zero @xmath8",
    "this degeneracy is lifted and we expect the impurity entanglement to decrease dramatically . essentially , this is because when @xmath8 is increased it is more costly for the impurity to be entangled with far away parts of the systems : if the impurity is in a singlet with a spin far away , there are more dimers on weak bonds than if the impurity bonds with a site that is close to it .",
    "if we consider @xmath13 even , then , in order to have sizeable entanglement , the bulk of the chain must have a site in a valence - bond with the impurity - spin and this spin is then bound to one end of the chain  @xcite .    for a chain with an even number of spins we expect to be able to describe @xmath22 in terms of an ivb picture for which an estimate of @xmath150 is needed for non - zero @xmath8 . such an estimate has been derived by uhrig ( reference  @xcite ) .",
    "they showed that to good approximation @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the airy - function and @xmath180 is its biggest root . here",
    ", the size of the area the impurity - spin binds to is roughly given by @xmath181 , where @xmath182 .",
    "our variational approach directly yields the lowest state vector which is simply @xmath150 . in figure",
    "[ fig : negtrans](a ) we compare this directly to the @xmath183 where it can be seen that the agreement is good .",
    "it is noteworthy that the maximum in @xmath150 is quite distant from the end of the chain in agreement with previous results .",
    "we can use this result to estimate @xmath22 using equation  ( [ eq : ivb ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : negtrans](b ) we see typical graphs of the behaviour of the negativity as @xmath8 is increased with @xmath140 and @xmath184 .",
    "the range over which the impurity - site is entangled is decreased upon increasing the dimerization .",
    "figure  [ fig : negtrans](b ) also includes the impurity valence bond entropy ( ivb ) obtained from equation  ( [ eq : ivb ] ) using the airy functions for @xmath150 . for easier comparison with the negativity we scaled by a factor of @xmath185 .",
    "for @xmath6 we used equation  ( [ solwave ] ) for @xmath150 . a reasonable agreement between @xmath22 and the ivb contribution ( solid lines ) is observed .",
    "overall , as one would expect , the impurity entanglement is now dramatically suppressed .",
    "even for @xmath186 the impurity entanglement is effectively zero beyond 60 sites . following the above discussion we expect the extent over which the impurity entanglement is non - zero to diverge as @xmath187 as dictated by @xmath23 .",
    "we have presented detailed discussion of how variational calculations can be used to calculate the negativity .",
    "this approach is quite generally applicable and should be very precise close to the mg - point . a complete characterization of the impurity entanglement for any @xmath7 can then be obtained . for @xmath140 ( @xmath13 even )",
    "the impurity entanglement is long - range and extends throughout the system while for larger @xmath188 it decays exponentially with a length scale clearly different from the correlation length in the system .",
    "for @xmath13 odd the spe present at @xmath152 is rapidly destroyed once @xmath7 is decreased below @xmath189 . in both cases",
    "it would be valuable to perform higher precision calculations in order to determine whether or not a critical @xmath7 or @xmath190 is needed to destroy the impurity entanglement .",
    "when a non - zero dimerization is introduced and the ground - state degeneracy is lifted , the impurity entanglement rapidly disappears . it would be interesting to investigate impurity entanglement in other gapped systems with degenerate singlet ground - states .",
    "we are grateful to i. affleck and n. laflorencie for interesting discussions and prior collaborations that initiated this work .",
    "we also acknowledge fruitful discussions with a. bayat , s. bose and p. sodano and thank them for making their dmrg data for the negativity available to us .",
