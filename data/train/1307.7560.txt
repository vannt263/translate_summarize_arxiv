    "random matrix theory has existed for more than half a century , and its success is undeniable . a vast number of applications is known within the mathematical and physical sciences , and beyond ; we refer to  @xcite for a recent overview .",
    "a direction within random matrix theory , which has recently caught renewed attention is the study of products of random matrices . among others , products of matrices",
    "have been applied to disordered and chaotic systems  @xcite , matrix - valued diffusions  @xcite , quantum chromodynamics at finite chemical potential  @xcite , yang ",
    "mills theory  @xcite , finance  @xcite and wireless telecommunication  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", our attention will be directed towards the latter .    when considering products of matrices we are faced with the fact that the product often possesses less symmetries than the individual matrices .",
    "for example a product of symmetric matrices will not be symmetric in general . for simplicity",
    ", we will look at matrices with a minimum of symmetry .",
    "our discussion will concern products of matrices drawn from the wishart ensemble .",
    "thus the matrices have independently , identically distributed gaussian entries .",
    "also other proposals exist , e.g. by multiplying matrices that are chosen from a set of _ fixed _ matrices with a given probability .",
    "this problem has applications in percolation as was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "however it considerably differs from our approach , notably due to the lack of invariance .",
    "the statistical properties of the complex eigenvalues and real singular values of a product of matrices from the wishart ensemble have been discussed in several papers ( in the former case they are usually called ginibre matrices ) .",
    "macroscopic properties for eigenvalues of complex ( @xmath3 ) matrices have been discussed in the limit of large matrices using diagrammatic methods  @xcite , while proofs are given in  @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic behaviour of the singular values and their moments have also been discussed in the literature using probabilistic methods  @xcite as well as diagrammatic methods  @xcite .",
    "recently , the discussion of products of matrices from wishart ensembles has been extended to matrices of finite size  @xcite , but this discussion has so far been limited to the case of square matrices .",
    "we want to extend this discussion to include products of rectangular matrices .",
    "in particular , we consider the product matrix @xmath4 where @xmath5 are @xmath6 real ( @xmath7 ) , complex ( @xmath3 ) or quaternion ( @xmath8 ) matrices from the wishart ensemble . this paper is concerned with the singular values of such matrices , and the spectral correlation functions of @xmath9 .",
    "a discussion of the complex eigenvalues is postponed to a future publication  @xcite .",
    "matrix products like @xmath10 have direct applications in finance  @xcite , wireless telecommunication  @xcite and quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the generalisation from square to rectangular matrices is evident from its applications to e.g. wireless telecommunication .",
    "let us consider a mimo ( multiple  input multiple ",
    "output ) communication channel from a single source to a single destination via @xmath11 clusters of scatterers .",
    "the source and destination are assumed to be equipped with @xmath12 transmitting and @xmath13 receiving antennas , respectively . each cluster of scatterers is assumed to have @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) scattering objects .",
    "such a communication link is canonically described by a channel matrix identical to the complex version of the product matrix  . here the gaussian nature of the matrix entries models a rayleigh fading environment .",
    "this model was proposed in  @xcite , while the single channel model ( @xmath1 ) goes back to  @xcite .",
    "there is no reason to assume that the number of scattering object at each cluster in such a communication channel should be identical , which illustrates the importance of the generalisation to rectangular matrices .",
    "this paper will be organised as follows : in section  [ sec : jpdf ] we will find the joint probability density function for the singular values of the product matrix   in the complex case . starting with general @xmath16",
    "it turns out that the restriction to complex ( @xmath3 ) matrices is necessary , since our method relies on the harish - chandra  itzykson  zuber integration formula for the unitary group  @xcite .",
    "an explicit expression for all @xmath17-point correlation functions for the singular values will be derived in section  [ sec:2 mm ] using a two - matrix model and the method of bi - orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the spectral density and its moments will be discussed further in section  [ sec : moment ] , while we return to the above mentioned communication channel in section  [ sec : mimo ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions and outlook . some properties and identities for the special functions we encounter",
    "are collected in appendix  [ sec : meijer ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we are interested in the statistical properties of the singular values of the product matrix  , which is governed by the following partition function , @xmath18.\\ ] ] here @xmath19 denotes the euclidean volume , i.e. the exterior product of all independent one - forms , while @xmath20 is the corresponding unoriented volume element .    let us assume that the smallest dimension is @xmath21 .",
    "we stress that the properties of the non - zero singular values of @xmath22 are completely independent of this choice , see @xcite .",
    "thus , the product matrix , @xmath23 , has maximally rank @xmath12 .",
    "it follows that the product matrix can be parameterised as  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a square @xmath26 matrix with real , complex or quaternion entries , while @xmath27 is an orthogonal , a unitary or a unitary symplectic matrix for @xmath16 , respectively . from equation",
    "it is immediate that the non - zero singular values of the rectangular matrix @xmath22 are identical to the singular values of the square matrix @xmath25 .",
    "the ultimate goal is to derive the joint probability density function for these singular values . in  @xcite the invariance of the matrix measure for @xmath25 under permutations of the matrix dimensions , @xmath14 , was shown this invariance carries over to the joint probability density function of the singular values as we will see .",
    "the parametrisation   follows directly from a parametrisation of each individual matrix , @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",

    "the non - zero singular values of the rectangular product matrix   are identical to the singular values of the square product matrix @xmath37 with @xmath25 and @xmath30 , @xmath38 , defined above . for this reason",
    ", we can safely replace the random matrix model containing rectangular matrices with a random matrix model containing square matrices , only . in terms of the new variables we get for the partition function , in analogy to @xcite for @xmath1 , @xmath39 , \\label{jpdf : zx}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 .",
    "a more general version of this result will be derived in  @xcite . in the partition function   and in most of this section",
    "we neglect an overall normalisation constant , which is irrelevant for the computations .",
    "we reintroduce the normalisation in equation   and give the explicit value in equation  .",
    "the gaussian weight times a determinantal prefactor is sometimes referred to as the induced weight . for @xmath1 its complex eigenvalues have been studied in  @xcite .    in order to derive the joint probability density function for the singular values of the product matrix @xmath25 and thereby of equation",
    ", we follow the idea in  @xcite , and reformulate the partition function   in terms of the product matrices @xmath41 , for @xmath38 . in the following",
    "we assume that the product matrices , @xmath42 , are invertible ( note that this restriction only removes a set of measure zero ) .",

    "it is also desirable to know where the endpoints of support of the macroscopic spectrum are located .",

    "we assume that the resolvent behaves as @xmath209 with @xmath210 and @xmath211 in the vicinity of the edges , @xmath212 .",
    "this edge behaviour of the resolvent is known to hold in certain cases , e.g. @xmath1 yields @xmath213 ( except when the inner edge is zero , @xmath214 , then @xmath215 ) . due to",

    "the latter means that @xmath231 meaning that the matrix dimension @xmath232 decouples from the macroscopic theory .    in general the set of equations  ( [ moment : edge - eq1 ] ) and ( [ moment : edge - eq2 ] ) yields @xmath191 solutions of which two correspond to the inner and outer edge of the spectral density . in the special case",
    "where @xmath233 , there are only two solutions ( see figure  [ fig : saddle ] ) @xmath234 note that for @xmath1 this result reduces to the known values for the edges of the marenko  pastur density ( e.g. see  @xcite ) , while the limit @xmath235 reproduces the result for the product of square matrices , see  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to numerically verify that the result holds in general .",
    "looking at the equations   and  , an obvious question is : which solutions correspond to the edges of the spectrum ? in order to answer this question , we will derive the same equations through a different route .",
    "the rescaled spectral density   serves as the starting point , and the locations of the edges are determined using a saddle point approximation for large @xmath12 .",
    "this also illustrates the point that the finite @xmath14 expression discussed in this paper is equivalent to the result presented in  @xcite in the macroscopic limit .",
    "in the large-@xmath12 limit we may approximate the sum over @xmath131 , see equation  , by an integral .",

    "the contours @xmath242 and @xmath243 encircle the poles of the original meijer @xmath2-functions in accordance to definition  . in the large-@xmath12 limit",
    "these poles condense into cuts , such that the complex @xmath244-plane has a cut on the interval @xmath245 and the complex @xmath246-plane has a cut on the interval @xmath247 .",

    "furthermore , variation with respect to @xmath249 yields @xmath250 at the saddle point and due to the symmetry between the two saddle point equations we can restrict our attention to one of them .",

    "the only non - trivial result comes from @xmath255 . inserting this condition into the saddle point equation",
    "we reproduce formula  .",
    "the condition for @xmath252 is given by differentiating the left hand side of the saddle point equation   and setting this result equal to zero , @xmath256=0 .",

    "hence the saddle point method reproduces the result obtained from the algebraic equation   for the resolvent .",
    "the saddle points , which satisfy equation  , are the extrema of the function within the square brackets .",
    "this function has a pole at @xmath257 and goes to @xmath258 for @xmath259 such that there is exactly one minimum to the left of the pole , see figure  [ fig : saddle ] .",
    "on the right of the pole the function oscillates such that it has zeros at @xmath260 .",
    "since the rational function on the right hand side of equation   is continuous it has extrema between neighbouring zeros , see figure  [ fig : saddle ] , yielding @xmath0 additional extrema .",
    "it follows that the optimisation problem   has @xmath261 solutions for @xmath252 , which are all real : one solution @xmath262 which gives the outer edge of the spectrum @xmath263 , one solution @xmath264 which gives the inner edge of the spectrum @xmath265 , and @xmath11 solutions @xmath266 which must be disregarded due to the cut in the complex @xmath244-plane mentioned above .",
    "it is clear that equation   can not have more than @xmath261 solutions implying that we have found all solutions . with this result we know how to choose the correct solution of equation  , which was what we wanted to establish .     and",
    "@xmath267 must be disregarded due to the cuts in the complex ( @xmath268)-plane and complex @xmath244-plane , respectively .",
    "this leaves only two valid extrema which correspond to the inner edge and the outer edge , respectively .",
    "note that the solutions for the inner edge and the outer edge are separated by the pole at @xmath257 . ]    before ending the discussion about the edges of the spectral density , it is worth noting that equation   is an @xmath191-st order equation , and the general case can for this reason not be solved analytically .",
    "however , it is possible to set up some analytical bounds for the edges .",
    "the starting point are the conditions @xmath269 and @xmath270 for the saddle points .",
    "we will analyse step by step first the bounds on the inner edge , @xmath265 , and then on the outer edge , @xmath263 .",
    "let us consider the inner edge , @xmath265 .",
    "since @xmath271 , @xmath38 , we can readily estimate @xmath272 for any @xmath273 .",
    "note that these bounds hold since the rational function , @xmath274 , is strictly monotonously increasing in @xmath275 for @xmath273 .",
    "we plug equation   into equation   and extremise the lower and upper bound which yields @xmath276 where we made use of the result   for the case when all @xmath277 are equal to @xmath278 or to @xmath279 .",
    "the bounds   are not at all optimal .",
    "however they immediately reflect the fact that the inner edge vanishes if and only if @xmath280 vanishes .    for the outer edge we have to employ the condition",
    "@xmath281 which yields the estimates @xmath282 hereby we used the fact that the rational function , @xmath274 , is monotonously decreasing in @xmath275 in the considered regime .",
    "employing the result   we find the bounds @xmath283 again the bounds can certainly be improved but they give a good picture what the relation is between the case of degenerate @xmath277 , cf .",
    "equation  , and the general case , @xmath284 for @xmath285 .",
    "we will now turn to a brief discussion of the mutual information , which is an important quantity in wireless telecommunication .",
    "we look at a mimo communication channel with multi - fold scattering as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "the communication link is described by a channel matrix given by a product of complex ( @xmath3 ) matrices from the wishart ensemble as in equation  .",
    "the mutual information is defined as @xmath286 { \\nonumber}\\\\ & = \\sum_{a=1}^{n_0}\\log_2 \\big(1+\\gamma\\frac{s_a}{{\\mathcal n}_m } \\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath287 is the constant signal - to - noise ratio at the transmitter and @xmath288 are the singular values distributed according to the density  .",
    "the mutual information measures an upper bound for the spectral efficiency in bits per time per bandwidth ( @xmath289 ) .    in order to evaluate the expectation value of the mutual information , the so - called ergodic mutual information , we rewrite the logarithm as a meijer @xmath2-function , see equation  .",
    "we use the expression   for the functions @xmath133 , while we write @xmath124 in polynomial form  .",
    "the integration over the product of two meijer @xmath2-functions can be performed using equation  , which finally yields @xmath290 for square matrices , i.e. @xmath291 for all @xmath292 , this triple sum was derived in @xcite .",
    "although it is not obvious from this formulation , the mutual information is also independent of the ordering of @xmath87 .",
    "this is reflected after simplifying the expression   with help of a combination of the equations  , , , and to @xmath293 hence , the channel matrix does not depend on the ordering of the scattering objects as long as the signal passes through all scatterers .",
    "in this paper we have studied the correlations of the singular values of the product of @xmath0 rectangular complex matrices from independent wishart ensembles .",
    "this generalises the classical result for the so - called wishart ",
    "laguerre unitary ensemble ( or chiral unitary ensemble ) at @xmath1 , and is a direct extension of a recent result for the product of square matrices  @xcite . we have seen that the problem of determining the statistical properties of the product of rectangular matrices can be equivalently formulated as a problem with the product of quadratic matrices and a modified , also called induced measure , see @xcite for a general derivation .",
    "the expense of this reformulation of the problem is the introduction of additional determinants in the partition function .",
    "we have shown that the joint probability density function for the singular values can be expressed in terms of meijer-@xmath2 functions . the approach which we have used relies on an integration formula for the meijer-@xmath2 function as well as on the harish - chandra  itzykson  zuber integration formula . due to the latter",
    "this method is limited to the complex case ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown , using a two - matrix model and the method of bi - orthogonal polynomials , that all correlation functions can be expressed as a determinantal point process containing meijer-@xmath2 functions . from the explicit expressions we derived it follows that all correlation functions are independent of the ordering of the matrix dimensions .",
    "the level density ( or one - point correlation function ) was discussed in detail .",
    "we used the spectral density to calculate all moments and derived its macroscopic limit .",
    "in particular , we analysed the location of the end points of the spectrum in the macroscopic limit for arbitrary @xmath0 and derived some narrow bounds for the location of these edges .    as an application we briefly discussed the ergodic mutual information , and how the singular values of products of random matrices are related to progressive scattering in mimo communication channels .",
    "the results presented in this work concern matrices of finite size , while previous results for the product of rectangular random matrices were only derived in the macroscopic large-@xmath12 limit .",
    "the explicit expressions for all correlation functions at finite size make it possible to also discuss microscopic properties , such as the local correlations in the bulk and at the edges . due to known universality results for random matrices",
    "it is expected that such an analysis should reproduce the universal sine and airy kernel in the bulk and at the soft edge(s ) , respectively , after an appropriate unfolding .",
    "close to the origin the level statistics will crucially depend on whether or not the difference of the individual matrix dimensions to the smallest one , @xmath170 , scales with @xmath12 .",
    "if it does this will lead to a soft edge .",
    "else it is expected , that the microscopic behaviour at the origin will be sensitive to @xmath0 and @xmath87 .",
    "for a single matrix with @xmath1 ( the wishart ",
    "laguerre ensemble ) , it is already known that this limit yields different bessel universality classes labelled by @xmath294 .",
    "furthermore , the determinantal structure of the correlation functions make it possible to study the distribution of individual singular values , which is an intriguing problem in its own right .",
    "it has been pointed out in  @xcite , that for the product of two square matrices , @xmath201 and @xmath295 , the bi - orthogonal polynomials in question are special cases of multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "it is an intriguing task to see whether this approach can be extended to the more general case with @xmath82 and rectangular matrices .",
