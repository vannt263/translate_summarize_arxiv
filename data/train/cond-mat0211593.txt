    "the evidence for the formation of stripes in high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) and related materials increases continuously .",
    "after the theoretical prediction @xcite of stripes as a combined charge and spin - density wave phenomenon , years passed until a broad interest was triggered by experiments on insulating la@xmath1sr@xmath2nio@xmath3 ( lsno ) and superconducting la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath4 ( lsco).@xcite more recent experimental evidence@xcite for stripes in the paradigmatic htscs ybacuo@xmath5 ( ybco ) and bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( bscco ) strengthens the expectation that stripe formation in doped layered perovskites is quite generic .    in spite of the striking evidence for stripes in htscs , the causal connection between stripe formation and superconductivity still is a mystery",
    "it is puzzling that both phenomena coexist and that , nevertheless , stripes tend to suppress superconductivity.@xcite for this interplay spin order is more relevant than charge order . in particular , the strength of spin fluctuations appears to play a central role .",
    "static spin order seem to be much less compatible with superconductivity than dynamic spin order .    at present ,",
    "one important open question is to what extent the stripe model can account for spin fluctuations not only at low energies , where the incommensurate response is observed , but also over a wider energy range , including the resonance phenomenon at the antiferromagnetic wave vector ( see refs . and references therein ) .",
    "the specific form of the dynamic magnetic response  including incommensurability and @xmath0 resonance  gave rise to doubts that it could be consistent with the stripe model.@xcite on the other hand , there are proposals @xcite that both features may be rooted in a stripe - like spin - density wave .",
    "in this paper we complement the spin - wave analysis by batista _",
    "et al._.@xcite there , the emphasis was put on the incommensurate ratio between the spin spacing @xmath8 and the stripe spacing @xmath9 which gives rise to a continuous excitation spectrum . however , in many cases of interest , this ratio @xmath10 is very close to a rational or even integer value . within the stripe model one",
    "actually expects that integer values are very stable due to a lock - in of the superstructure into the atomic structure .",
    "this pinning mechanism is considered as the origin of the so called ` 1/8 conundrum ' in the cuprates,@xcite i.e. , the stability of @xmath11 over a considerable doping range .",
    "detailed measurements of the spin - excitation spectrum are available close to integer @xmath12 : @xmath13 in lsno,@xcite @xmath11 in lsco,@xcite and @xmath11@xcite and @xmath14@xcite in ybco .    in order to test whether these experiments can be consistent with the spin - wave excitation spectrum of a stripe model in the simplest and most transparent case , we therefore examine integer @xmath12 .",
    "particular attention is paid to the spin - wave band structure in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic wave vector .",
    "while the incommensurability as zero - frequency response is fixed by the geometry of the model , we calculate the spin - wave velocities at the incommensurability and the @xmath0 resonance as dynamic features .",
    "we evaluate the dependence of these quantities on the incommensurability ( respectively , the doping level ) and the exchange coupling across the stripes . by a quantitative comparison ,",
    "we determine the value of the exchange coupling across the stripes as the only _ a priory _ unknown model parameter .",
    "in particular , the dependence of the @xmath0 resonance on doping is found to be consistent with experiments .",

    "[ sec.disc ] the results of our theory are discussed and compared to experimental data .",
    "in the cuprates as well as in the nickelates , the metallic spins are located on square lattices in weakly coupled layers .",

    ", the holes induced by doping are assumed to form site - centered rivers that act like antiphase boundaries for the antiferromagnetic domains.@xcite the rivers are assumed to be only one lattice spacing wide ( cf .",
    "[ gs ] ) .",
    "since stripes are vertical in cuprates for doping concentrations where superconductivity occurs and diagonal in nickelates , we study both orientations with arbitrary integer stripe spacing @xmath12 . furthermore , since charge order seems to be static up to high temperatures , in ybco up to 300k,@xcite holes can be considered as immobile at low temperatures .",

    "the classical spin variables obey the translational symmetry @xmath22 . by placing the origin at a hole position we obtain the additional reflection symmetry",
    "@xmath23 .    for a paradigmatic and minimalistic description of magnetic quantum fluctuations we use a spin - only model with pair exchange .",
    "more complicated exchange processes such as cyclic exchange@xcite may be important for quantitative purposes but are ignored here for simplicity .",
    "we use a generalized heisenberg model on the two - dimensional square lattice@xcite @xmath24 where the primed sums run over all spin positions with @xmath25 .",
    "the exchange couplings obey the symmetry relations    @xmath26    [ symm ]    in fact , the exchange couplings may have a higher symmetry corresponding to the hole lattice , which however will not be needed explicitly in the further analysis . to implement that the hole strings act as antiphase boundaries between antiferromagnetic domains , we assume that @xmath27 for nearest neighbors @xmath28 , @xmath29 within the domains and @xmath30 for nearest neighbors across a string .",
    "while it is natural to assume that @xmath31 should be comparable to the exchange coupling in the undoped material , the coupling @xmath32 may deviate significantly . to keep the number of parameters small",
    ", we ignore that the exchange coupling even within an antiferromagnetic domain should depend on the position of the pair relative to the hole strings .",
    "we address the spin dynamics in the framework of linear spin - wave theory ( for a review in the context of cuprates , see e.g. ref . ) . in the following analytic part",

    "_ et al.__@xcite on lsno . in this experiment ,",
    "two magnetic resonances are observed at @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "for @xmath202 we expect a singularity in the single - magnon density at @xmath210 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.zust ] ) , which would correspond to a two - magnon resonance at @xmath211 .",
    "if corrections due to magnon interactions are modest , the resonance of the theory could be idebtified with the upper experimental one . then the resonance at the lower frequency can not be understood . on the other hand , for @xmath150 not too close to @xmath212 the single - band structure for @xmath13 would lead to several well - separated extrema but contradict the above determination of @xmath150 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath165 , the additional resonance lies above @xmath167 since it arises from extrema close to the upper band edge and there is only a saddle - point at @xmath169 .",
    "this apparent contradiction might be resolved if either interaction corrections are large , additional exchange interaction are important , or the lower experimental resonance is of different origin .      in the present study",
    ", we _ assume _ the presence of charge stripes and evaluate the spin dynamics for a simple model .",
    "the question of why stripes are formed and how stripe formation is related to superconductivity therefore can not be addressed . in particular",
    ", the simple spin - only model misses the coupling of spin fluctuations to the superconducting order parameter .",
    "consequently , our analysis misses the opening of a spin gap due to superconductivity .",
    "therefore , the spin dynamics for @xmath213 is masked by superconductivity ( see table [ tab.2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can expect the stripe - like spin dynamics to remain visible in superconducting samples for @xmath214 .",
    "such a gap has been observed in experiments on lsco ( e.g. , @xmath215 mev near optimal doping with @xmath216k;@xcite a gap smaller than @xmath217 mev for underdoped samples with @xmath218k and @xmath219k@xcite ) and on ybco ( e.g. , @xmath220 mev for a highly underdoped material with @xmath221k;@xcite @xmath222 mev for a moderately underdoped material with @xmath223k;@xcite @xmath224 mev for near optimal doping with @xmath225k@xcite ) .",
    "for ybco there is evidence@xcite for a proportionality between @xmath226 which is not far away from the bcs weak - coupling limit with @xmath227 .    furthermore  and more importantly in the present context ",
    "there is evidence for such a ( rough ) proportionality not only between @xmath228 and @xmath229 but also between @xmath228 and @xmath230 ( @xmath231 for underdoped ybco,@xcite @xmath232 for under- and overdoped bscco@xcite ) . from our theory",
    ", we expect @xmath167 to be roughly inversely proportional to @xmath12 , see eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig.d_w ] . at low doping @xmath12 should be inversely proportional to the doping level ( @xmath233 ) , i.e. , @xmath167 should be proportional to the doping level .",
    "such a relation was found in a previous theoretical study of the hubbard model,@xcite where it was attributed to a particle - particle collective mode .",
    "although our approach is technically much less involved , it provides an alternative explanation which is not in contradiction with the previous one since stripe order itself can be considered as a collective phenomenon that can be derived from the hubbard model.@xcite    on the other hand , at larger doping there is no simple relation between the doping level and @xmath12 . in ybco , for example , the charge - transfer mechanism between the cuo@xmath6 plane and the cuo chains interferes . in lsco",
    "it is well documented that @xmath12 saturates at @xmath11 for @xmath234.@xcite beyond that point ( which corresponds to optimum doping@xcite ) , additional holes may populate the antiferromagnetic domains without affecting their period @xmath12 .",
    "however , these excess holes may suppress the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling in analogy to holes in the spin - glass phase ( ref .",
    "reports the corresponding suppression of the spin - wave velocity ) .",
    "hence , the effective @xmath31 and , consequently , also @xmath167 may shrink with overdoping as seen in experiments on bscco.@xcite    for lsco , so far no direct evidence for a @xmath0 resonance has been found .",
    "this could be simply because the resonance intensity is expected to be only @xmath235% of the total magnetic scattering.@xcite however , if the @xmath0 resonance  in the sense of a merger of the incommensurate signals  can be attributed to magnons in stripes which are particularly well established for lsco , one definitely should expect such a resonance . for underdoped lsco ( @xmath236 , @xmath219k )",
    "there is evidence for @xmath237 mev ( where incommensurate response becomes commensurate).@xcite a similar signal was observed at even lower doping in the spin - glass phase ( @xmath238 mev for @xmath239).@xcite    like for lsno , we may use the values of @xmath31 , @xmath12 , and @xmath167 to estimate @xmath150 for the cuprates .",
    "for ybco with @xmath240 mev , @xmath14 , and @xmath241 mev,@xcite we obtain @xmath242 from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.v_w ] . if we take @xmath243 mev and @xmath244 mev for lsco with @xmath236,@xcite an even smaller value @xmath245 is found .",
    "> from this result we may predict where the resonance @xmath167 should be expected in lsco near optimal doping ( @xmath11 ) . for @xmath243 mev and @xmath246",
    "we find @xmath247 mev .",
    "while the resulting values for @xmath167 have a certain spread , they suggest that the resonance frequency should be at least as large as in optimally doped ybco .    in the experiments known to us , the considered energy range was simply too small to detect the resonance for optimally doped lsco : @xmath248 mev in , @xmath249 mev in refs .  , @xmath250 mev in ref . .",
    "however , from pulsed neutron scattering evidence has been found for a broad peak in the momentum - integrated susceptibility between 40 and 70 mev@xcite which could be ascribed to the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "apparently , @xmath150 seems to be significantly smaller in the cuprates than in the nickelates . at the same time",
    ", @xmath35 is smaller ( although @xmath31 is larger )",
    ". therefore one may wonder whether static magnetic stripe order is already destroyed by quantum fluctuations without invoking competing orders leading to a gap .",
    "for @xmath251 the coupling needs to satisfy @xmath252 to stabilize spin order for @xmath13,@xcite while for @xmath11 a finite @xmath253 is sufficient.@xcite for @xmath14 ( as for every odd @xmath12 ) one again expects a finite critical @xmath150 . if the intersptripe coupling is below this value , the presence of a spin gap can be understood also within the spin - only model .      in summary",
    ", we find that the spin fluctuations of stripes can provide a simple and valuable description of the dynamics observed in high-@xmath228 compounds and related materials . already our minimalistic spin - only model provides an accurate account of experiments on lsno and possibly also a unifying framework for incommensurate response and the @xmath0 resonance in the cuprates .",
    "while such a framework has been suggested recently,@xcite it is analyzed and evaluated here for the most transparent case of integer periods @xmath12 .",
    "our results unravel the evolution of the band structure with @xmath12 for diagonal and vertical stripe configurations .",
    "likewise , we have explicitly determined the dependence of characteristic spin - wave velocities and of the resonance frequency on @xmath12 and @xmath150 .",
    "thereby , we postulate that the @xmath0 resonance reflects the magnon frequency @xmath167 of the lowest lying band with nonvanishing weight .",
    "in particular , @xmath167 was found to be roughly inversely proportional to @xmath12 in agreement with experiments .",
    "hopefully , future experiments can provide more direct evidence for the @xmath0 resonance also in lsco .",
    "this would also relax the controversial question , whether spin excitations in lsco and ybco are analogous@xcite or not.@xcite if stripe magnons indeed explain the spin dynamics at intermediate energies , as we expect , they would provide a unifying framework for understanding the spin dynamics above the gap scale",
    ". then the stripe physics would be also of great importance as basement for superconductivity as low - energy phenomenon .",
    "naturally , several aspects remain unexplained by our minimalistic theory .",
    "for example , our model can not be expected to explain why the magnetic incommensurability disappears at @xmath228 in ybco@xcite while charge order is visible up to 300k.@xcite probably this is a question to the stripe - forming mechanism and to a possible coupling between the order parameters for stripe order and superconductivity . in lsco ,",
    "the vicinity of soft phonons and structural instabilities may help to stabilize stripes at temperatures above the superconducting transition .    for future studies it would be interesting to include effects of the bilayer coupling present in ybco and bscco , of the weak 3d coupling present in all materials , as well as spin anisotropy , more complicated spin interactions ( e.g. four - spin cyclic exchange@xcite ) , excitations beyond spin waves ( e.g. double - spin excitations@xcite ) , mobility of spins , and effects of disorder , to name just a few .",
